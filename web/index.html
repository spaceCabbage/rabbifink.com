      <h1>In Memory of Rabbi Eliyahu Fink</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Rabbi Eliyahu Fink z”l</strong> was more than a rabbi—he was a
        thinker, a challenger of norms, and a bridge between tradition and the
        modern world. Through his blog <em>FinkOrSwim</em> and his public
        writings, he sparked important conversations across Jewish communities
        and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space is being carefully restored as a living archive of his
        legacy. We are working to bring back his essays, ideas, and reflections
        for all those who found inspiration in his voice—and for those who never
        had the chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for your patience as we rebuild this site with the care and
        respect it deserves.
