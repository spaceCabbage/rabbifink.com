		<description><![CDATA[&quot;&lt;i&gt;If the Talmud was being written today, I don’t think apples would have the
 same significance in our Talmud as they did 15o0 years ago.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;

If the Hebrew Wikipedia (&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%93%D7%A8_%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9C_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94#.D7.9E.D7.90.D7.9B.D7.9C.D7.99.D7.9D_.D7.A0.D7.95.D7.A1.D7.A4.D7.99.D7.9D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;סדר ליל ראש השנה#מאכלים נוספים&lt;/a&gt;&quot;) is anything to go by, eating apples is a Rishonic rather than a Talmudic custom:
Using honey is Geonic in origin (based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38277&#038;pgnum=229&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a responsum by Natronai Gaon&lt;/a&gt;). According to Mahzor Vitri (&lt;a href=&quot;http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14643&#038;pgnum=570&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;end of section 323&lt;/a&gt;) in [northern] France they ate red apples, but in Provence (southern France) they ate white grapes and white figs. Only later were the customs of honey and apple united into what we know today (and gets mention in &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2645&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Tur Orah Hayim 583&lt;/a&gt;). Later still it reached Sephardic communities (though with reservations regarding the use of honey).

So, if people are fine with not eating pumpkin, fenugreek, leek, beet or dates (based on the Soncino translation of Kerithoth 6a), which are mentioned in the Talmud, Then they should have no problem with eating some other (more accessible) kind of sweet fruit (or vegetable), instead of apples, who&#039;s origins are Rishonic (and regional), to begin with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How about an Appletini or apple cocktail?  But I can&#039;t stand that syrupy stuff.  So here is my rendition:  1 1/2 oz good quality Vodka, 1 oz apple brandy, 2 oz ginger beer.  Pour over ice and add a splash of cranberry juice.  Garnish with slice of honey-dipped apple. For children you can substitute fresh apple juice for the alcohol. How&#039;s that for a new tradition that will ensure a good and sweet new year, or at least an enjoyable evening?  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let me flip this entire post on its belly. Or try at least. You say apples are an anachronism? You say we ought to create new traditions for the 21st century? Well, what says more about the time we live in than the &lt;em&gt;ability&lt;/em&gt; to transport goods and services from one location to another? The ability for me to eat an apple here (in LA), is a testament that geography is no barrier. It&#039;s not an anachronism. It fits perfectly for our time.


But in general, I don&#039;t know how you are judging what an anachronism is. After all, there are plenty of things that are far and away from LA that we routinely use, and WANT to use, because those before us have used. Vineyards, farms, potatoes, etc. etc.  But we use all this not jus on holidays but on everyday basis. I know you are not saying these things or even nostalgia is bad, I just don&#039;t get how you are judging what makes something an anachronism and what doesn&#039;t.]]></description>
