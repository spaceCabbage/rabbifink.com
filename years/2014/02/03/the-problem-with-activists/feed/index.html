		<description><![CDATA[It does, actually.  I know that sounds strange but taking over land and forming a new country on it while not giving the residents there citizenship or any other kind of formal status was explicitly outlawed by the international community after World War II.  There was massive disruption of European populations during WWII.  Germany took over various countries, deported and killed the people they did not like, various countries were invaded on the pretext that German speakers lived there, etc.  This is why the UN has consistently judged Israeli management of the 67 territories pretty harshly.  To be fair, one should also talk about China and Tibet, India and Pakistan, the UK and Northern Ireland and a variety of other situations when one discusses these issues and very few people do.  In fact, I&#039;ve never heard anyone on the Left who thinks Israel should not exist (chas v&#039;shalom) ever say that Pakistan should also not exist.  When that happens, we will be closer to discussing the Geneva Convention on its merits.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My question is, whose land does the territory belong to? It belonged to Jordan, correct? Jordan relinquished any hold over the west bank after the peace accords. So why does it by default belong to the people living there as opposed to the country that won it? Why wasn&#039;t Jordan occupying it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a lot of hubris - it&#039;s essentially telling history to stop ... &quot;we have the perfect arrangement in the world today.&quot;


But seriously, had it passed before 1948, and absent any agreements, would also be calling the rest of the area &quot;Palestinian territory&quot;? And if it passed (was ratified) after 1967, would you be telling the Palestinians to go pound sand?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think the way you are applying the Geneva Convention is universally accepted. (If Israel&#039;s conquering of land during a defensive war went against the GC, it would be sited rather than the UN resolutions calling for Israel to withdraw.)

The answer to your question is between 2488 and 2495 since creation. It was conquered by others (many times), and most recently was conquered by Israel from Jordan. Jordan has not asked for it back. Most assume that most of the land would be given to Palestinian Arabs as part of a negotiated deal.

Most also assume that as part of that negotiated deal there would be land swaps, so it is unclear whether the land SodaStream has its factory will ever become part of Palestine.

Saying it is currently technically Palestinian (Arab) territory is at the very least disputed, and quite possibly disingenuous. (And only makes a real peace harder to accomplish.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From Wikipedia:

Area C (full Israeli civil and security control): circa 72-74% (first phase, 1995). Under the Wye River Memorandum, Israeli would further withdrawal from some additional 13%, which officially reduced Area C to circa 61% of the West Bank. Israel, however, withdrew from only 2% and during Operation Defensive Shield, it reoccupied all territory.

Oslo II defines Area C as:

″areas of the West Bank outside Areas A and B, which, except for the issues that will be negotiated in the permanent status negotiations, will be gradually transferred to Palestinian jurisdiction in accordance with this Agreement″.

The issues that will be negotiated, according to Article XVII, are ″Jerusalem, settlements, specified military locations, Palestinian refugees, borders, foreign relations and Israelis; and ... powers and responsibilities not transferred to the Council″. Parts of Area C are military area closed for Palestinians.
---------------------------

Until it is negotiated to be handed over, it is not undisputed. It&#039;s bad enough to take a position that is wrong. It&#039;s worse to not even acknowledge other positions. That is what extremists do (such as the extremist activists who are the focus of this post).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure what the other int&#039;l orgs you refer to are, but I&#039;ll take your word that the UN as a body has spoken and pronounced the settlements illegal. I myself don&#039;t follow their diktats. Assuming that&#039;s right, and that you meant &quot;the UN&quot;, when you referred to &quot;the International Community&quot;, then of course I&#039;d agree. But I don&#039;t think anyone expects anything else from an organization that thinks Zionism = Racism.
Derech agav, you keep writing about &quot;nuance&quot;, as though no one else is aware of the concept. Everyone, (at least, all Jews) understand that life is complicated. There are very, very few things in life that are NOT nuanced. The question is, as I&#039;ve said before, to what extent do we allow our actions to be watered down by nuance? To what extent are we better served by single-minded approaches, and deliberately ignoring nuance? Quite often the latter is the path to follow.  It is clear that this latter path is the best approach when it comes to Israeli land issues. Compare the success the Zionists had until 1967, when official policy all but ignored the Palestinians, with what&#039;s transpired since the mid 80s. Sadly, we have lost much land and many lives, with nothing to show for it. That&#039;s what you get for recognizing &quot;nuance.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I’ve seen activists for all kinds of causes take their causes to the logical extreme. These people are not part of any solutions.

That almost sounds like the &#039;no-true scottsman&#039; fallacy. An activist by it&#039;s nature must take something to their logical extreme or else why is he advocating? So they are not the fringe. They are what they are. Activists.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The facts are that the International community considers the settlements illegal under international law. This is a fact.&quot;
No, it isn&#039;t. It is no more fact than asserting &quot;public opinion supports X&quot;, or anything like that. There is no such thing as &quot;the international community.&quot;  People do not speak with one voice.
I will tell you an undisputed fact, though. In December of 2000, when I was in law school, the ABA Journal published its magazine on the subject of Palestinian refugees, asserting right on the front cover that &quot;international law is on their side.&quot;  Now the ABA is well-known as a left-wing organization, to the extent that some jurists (lawyers and sitting judges)  have argued that membership within it ought to disqualify judges from claiming impartiality. The Bush administration stopped using them to vet judicial candidates because of their left wing viewpoints.  Even so, that  article generated an enormous amount of responses and criticism, from many people part of the so-called &quot;international community&quot;, refuting the claim that international law was on the side of the Palestinians. 
The focus of that article might be a tad different than the issue of settlements. Maybe. But the point is the same.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Palestinian employees quite well, paying them much higher wages than completing jobs in the region with great benefits and break time for Muslim prayer in their onsite Mosque. This is really an irrelevant argument. If your business is illegal, it doesn’t really matter how friendly you are to you employees.&quot;


I disagree.  It would be irrelevant if BDS and Oxfam were just about enforcing international law and were bringing a lawsuit.  But they are not.  Few social activists, if any, are fueled by a love of rule of law and its impartial application in all cases.  Rather they are fueled by what they perceive as a moral wrong that needs to be rectified.  In terms of a moral argument, whether SodaStreams actions are right or wrong, that SodaStream treats their employees very well and that the employees are happy is very relevant.]]></description>
