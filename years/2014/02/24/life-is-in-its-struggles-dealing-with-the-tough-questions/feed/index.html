		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,

Thank you. I have approached divrei Chazal like this for a while now. Why does this seem like such a chidush to many people? Chazal were intellectual and moral giants. In their times they adapted the Torah to make it a Toras Chaim, a relevant moral code. The great thinkers amongst the Jewish people have always done this (and are doing it today). That&#039;s why today women do learn Torah and are considered to be able to contribute more than just sewing accumen. They were great then. Many wise men are great now. 

There is however another approach which is still more accurate than the apologetic approach. Perhaps Chazal meant what they said, and were right! True it&#039;s not PC but neither are korbanos, killing amalek, death penalty for shabbos desecration or many other things. Maybe women ideally should not learn. Maybe they can contribute more by providing family care than any other avenue. Maybe their emotions are too wishy washy to be able to think critically enough to decide moral, ethical or philosophical issues. Maybe even though a few women may break the mold, better that they would not fight nature and become compassionate nurturers instead. The irony is that my wife takes this position over mine! Olam hafuch raeesi! True, if this is the correct &quot;Torah&quot; approach then I may be in a moral dilemma of wanting to accept Torah but feeling that it is immoral. (I imagine our friend Tuvia may have had this issue at some point. He has decided by now). However, at least I can say that I am honest about what Torah is. (And after all, if one believes that it is from the Creator himself then it is ipso facto the &quot;moral&quot; approach).

The point is that when we learn Torah we have to try to understand what the navi, tana, amora, rishon, rav or rebbe is saying and only then think about how it fits in with what we think or believe. If we first formulate our opinions and then learn Torah, we will always try to apologetically explain everything and never honestly know what the text in question actually says! I&#039;d rather be a scholar but struggle to relate to what I learn (even though it may create a crisis of faith) than be inspired by what I made up and pretended is an ancient Torah value. 


Thanks again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;These offensive statements do not bother me at all. Not even a tiny bit.&quot;

This sounds like what someone in the Abie Rotenberg zone would say. Wouldn&#039;t it be more honest to acknowledge the struggle and contradiction of, on the one hand, building our life around divrei Chazal, and on the other, being forced to recognize some of them as flawed?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No. That is what the torah REALLY meant. Israelite cosmology as recorded in the Torah follows the exact pattern of other ANE cultures. Rakia means something that is hammered in like a dome. That is what is meant by the waters above and the waters below. The dome separates the two and later the windows that opened up for the flood are considered literal windows in the enclosure that allow the top waters to pour in.

		<description><![CDATA[paging all Slifikn heresy hunters...
this was exactly the heretical idea that got r&#039; nathan into trouble, if you ever gain any traction in the charadi world you will have to disassociate from this post, most charadim who&#039;s core identity is tied to the belief that chaza&quot;l were near perfect can not entertain such thoughts they even make this an issue of kifirah as the torah hamatzuia ATA beydaniu hi shnitnah l&#039;moshe r. al&quot;h. and how could people with such shortcomings possibly give over the right messorah, and if you tell me god divinely orchestrated the proper transmission despite there human frailty&#039;s why would he have allowed the mistakes that we do notice to slip in?
the truth is this is the best post i have read from you but i think you assume people are trying to sweep things under and hide things this is not the case my experience has shown that most frum people are not bothered by the big issues because they are not sufficiently interested to bother working the whole argument through so shav veal tasa adif as long as things are OK why examine my beliefs]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with your conclusion about the importance of being willing to address the problematic issues and to struggle with them. 
But I think you missed one of the main reasons why people have felt the need to suger-coat the offensive statements made by Chazal and why your simple (and probably true) approach is not accepted by so many people. It&#039;s because, as John pointed out, once you accept that even on the most basic halachic issues, Chazal were influenced by the societal norms of the day and that not every statement made by Chazal or every halacha or minhag promulgated by them is pure Divine will, there&#039;s very little reason to accept that there&#039;s anything holy about them. this includes the very belief that they ARE holy. 
You&#039;re then forced to backtrack and to argue that change should come slowly rather than quickly, but you&#039;re holding your finger in the dike and not making a convincing case for preserving anything. John took this to its extreme conclusion regarding faith itself but it&#039;s obviously true all across halacha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fair point. I try to give enough background that it makes sense to any reader who is willing to look up a few hebrew words or phrases. I view this is a platform for discussion so it&#039;s okay if not everyone gets everything. Ask, and you will be answered.


If you think my answer is pathetic, I would appreciate some explanation as to why you think it is pathetic.


Finally, yes there are questions that are going to follow up this post. Let&#039;s engage in them. No reason to shy away from them. Clearly, if reading this post will push someone out of orthodoxy, we have great issues that need to be dealt with, not covered up again.]]></description>

I think you are absolutely correct. There is nothing wrong with struggling with faith either. I wrote about that last week!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;female judges invariably are listed as the worst judges&quot; - proves nothing.
Even if true it still a bell curve. even if you are correct that women on average are worse a torah studies, which is most likely untrue. You can be sure they there will be plenty of women better at it than you. Are you saying they cant study torah but you can?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I admire your message of not hiding from questions and desiring to share in people&#039;s struggles. Kol Hakavod.
I would like to make two points. If these statements, as well as countless others, reflect the attitudes and knowledge of the time, why is it so hard to extend that to their belief and thoughts about a deity. That too may be a product of their time. 
In the struggle that you mention and say that some questions don&#039;t have good answers as yet, how is it an intellectually honest discussion when the answer of non-divine source is not considered?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When you write blog posts like this, you many times may end up bringing up questions or difficulties that were never in a person&#039;s mind in the first place, and you may then provide what you think is a good enough answer, that your readers may not be convinced with.  It seems that you also are under the assumption that your readers already have a good amount of background to certain topics and ideas in Judaism that would be necessary to understanding some of your answers, which they in fact may not have. 


For example in this case.  After bringing up this very controversial topic, you answer, &quot;Yes. Our rabbis understood women differently than we do today. That’s okay. They understood all social and scientific conditions as they were in their day and so do we. It’s not a big deal.&quot;


Your answer to this very broad and difficult topic is that the rabbis &quot;understood women differently&quot; because of social conditions, so therefore &quot;it&#039;s not a big deal.&quot;  Really?  Seriously?  That&#039;s it?  There are such better and more thorough ways of understanding and explaining this topic that you could have at least mentioned.  There are so many inevitable follow up questions and problems that arise with your answer that need to be addressed to fully explain this difficult topic, but you just ignore them completely.  You would have done better not to even mention this topic than to give that pathetic answer.    When people write you that your blog led them to leave Orthodoxy, maybe it&#039;s because of blog posts like this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;....We are extremely uncomfortable with taking these statements literally. .... we simply don’t agree with the literal interpretations of these statements. We know that women are actually as smart as men. We know that women can do a lot of things that these statements seem to imply they are incapable of doing....&quot;
We, we, we. Did you canvass the opinions of everyone in the world before you deigned to become their self-appointed spokesman?
I offer no opinion as to whether chazal were right or wrong, nor as to what people truly think. But I do know this. In confidential, no name surveys taken by the legal community of my area, female judges invariably are listed as the worst judges. I also know that vast, vast numbers of people keep their real opinions to themselves, with regard to race, sex, or religion,  or any of the other &quot;protected classes&quot; of  Title VII, for legal reasons. Get to know people a little better, or, as we get reminded every now and then, get them really drunk, and you can occasionally get a glimpse behind the curtain.
I emphasize I express no opinion on the merits of the question, viz., were chazal right in their assessments of women. What galls me is the arrogance (or foolishness) of thinking we know what other people think.]]></description>

I state it very simply - Just like [most of] Chazal were wrong about astrology (altogether bunk), astronomy (rakia), origin of lice (spontaneous), they were also wrong about women (thinking that the difference between men and women, especially with regards to mental capacity and leadership ability, is larger than it really is).]]></description>
