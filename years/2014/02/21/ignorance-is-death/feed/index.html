		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Rabbi Goldberg from Boca Raton Synagogue (along with several commenters) politely took issue with my position. ...... He says that allowing Khalidi to speak is a pluralism that is too liberal invoking the famous “so open minded their brains fall out” expression to describe my thinking on this matter. - 
Wow. My friend, the above lines makes you appear terribly conceited. Rabbi Goldberg wasn&#039;t addressing YOUR position, nor did he choose that expression to describe YOUR thinking. He was speaking about the issue in general, and your blog was just an example he cited halfway through of the position he was attacking. You make it appear as though you were his focus. 
On the merits, there&#039;s not much to talk about, in my opinion. Rabbi Goldberg is right, and there&#039;s the end to it. What I did find funny, though, is how everyone is tossing around the &quot;racist&quot; word. Apparently the arab in question referred to Israel as a racist state. In response, many others are referring to him himself as a racist. Meanwhile, one of your commenters below says an unnamed well-known tzaddik is actually a racist. Is there anyone out there who isn&#039;t a racist?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And when you say no society is fully open to all options – you are correct that when it comes to education, schools, etc.  not every view is permitted.  But this has much more to do with not letting the campus environment become hostile to minorities – who attend and have every right to feel welcome.

We don’t let people yell fire in a crowded theater.  You can’t just threaten to kill someone without ramifications.  You can’t on schools make a group or race or gender feel unwelcome.

But this is a democracy – if people want to be racists they can be.  As a society however, we have used our democratic vote to, over time, agree as a people on how we want to handle incendiary free speech.  And it can change.

We basically live by the Bill of Rights, which is a product of the Enlightenment.  Though religious people try to rewrite history – our founding fathers basically thought G-d was an impediment to progress.  They fought even back then for atheists to have full rights as citizens.  We, as a society, believe in “self evident truths,” inalienable rights, etc. that accrue to all.

Religion does not believe in individuality.  It’s not enough in religion for people to have a right to think as they wish – and an obligation not to make others think a certain way.  In religion, they insist you think a certain way – or go to hell or lose your place in the world to come or whatever.

You think that’s cool?  It sets us back.  Is is spiritual death threats – you like that?

Yet you like Judaism.  A religion that does not believe in democracy, or individual choice.

You like that.  Why?  There is a little bit of a despot in all religious strong believers.  A controlling little man inside your full grown one – a childish part – that wants to tell everyone how they must think.

You like that guy in you?  You think that’s better than democracy, natural rights, inalienable rights?

You like potentates telling us how we must think and act? Why?  Really: why?

Every good thing is found in the secular world (as well as bad): the US has pioneered the values of world governance that has inspired people around the world (and in our world) to seek their rights.

The real “light unto the nations” is the US.  Not Judaism.

Why again do you prefer a potentate that tells us gays cannot marry?  That girls can be sold into slavery?  That women are property? 

A world view that always points backward to our sages and great rabbis – many of whom said things we must utterly ignore now they are so out of date?

Really: why?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have no problem with folks teaching their kids values.  I have no problem with a family keeping kosher, shabbos, etc.  I have no problem with anyone feeling or thinking anything, saying how they feel, feeling things. 

I don’t believe in thought crimes. I think it is disgusting to tell people they will lose their place in the world to come because they don’t think “correct thoughts.” I think when moronic kiruv rabbis (I have some in my family) want to “educate” the Jewishly illiterate on the “beauty” of being a woman in Judaism – they should talk about the nice and the not so nice – Judaism has both in its dessicated, backward view of the world.

So women are equal in a sense, but they can also be sold into slavery, they don’t own anything, if they don’t meet their husband with a meal and a drink they can be beaten.  Men can demand sex whenever, women sometimes. Those are our “wise” sages too.  Yawn, double yawn.  Jewish education is handled with lies and half truths.

I think if it is going to dismiss the work of modern biblical critics, it should permit the critics in to make their case.

You don’t have to know anything about Judaism to tell your kids to wait until marriage.  There are a million orthodox Jews in the world.  The rest of the world still has to raise their kids.  You don’t need to use OJ as the only available guide to raise your kids.  Average middle class white folks somehow raise very good kids too.  Maybe even on the whole more functional, more mentally healthy, less intellectually imprisoned.

Raise your kids to respect the golden rule (taught in every religion and culture) and raise them to stay away from the opposite sex til the right time.  Neither requires a Jewish background.

Just stay honest, that is a pretty outside the box idea in OJ.  Thanks for reading and responding..!

		<description><![CDATA[How did I know you would quote me all the &quot;orthodox academics&quot; who believe in the documentary hypothesis? You always go there! It&#039;s like your favorite back up plan. Either way that&#039;s not even the point.  If you don&#039;t accept traditional Judaism, great, do your thing.  But there is no reason why parents who do should teach their children things that they believe not only to be false, but dangerous.  Would you allow a white supremacist to come into your child&#039;s class and give his reasons for why blacks are less worthy of rights? Maybe he has some very valid points.  Why are you keeping them blind to his reasoning?  Chareidi children can also go to the library and read about Zionism, Biblical Criticism and the LGBT community.  That is very different than having a transvestite come for show and tell.  Please Tuv, I grew up in a secular world.  I was not taught that all points of view deserve equal attention.  No one in sex ed encouraged us to consider celibacy until marriage.  No one considered allowing a Nazi student group in my high school. Let&#039;s face it.  No society is fully open to all options.  So you happen to be more open minded than the Chareidi world. Great. I&#039;m sure you are more close minded than some other group of people and they look at you like a crazy-eyed zealot.  Oh and btw, I&#039;m not Chareidi.  I also think they are too closed minded.  The difference is, I don&#039;t have a high horse.  I&#039;d rather walk through the mud with the rest of the world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And perhaps to answer your question more directly:

The only idea that makes sense is to teach the traditional view, and the secular view.

The traditional view is that the world is 6000 years old.  The secular view is that it is billions of years old.  Here’s what tradition tells us.  Here’s what the scientists think, and more importantly, why they think it.  The evidence they have evaluated.

You can do that for virtually every topic. Even where Torah comes from. 

As far as I can tell there are at the very least ten or twenty orthodox academics who came in to academia with the idea that the Torah was written by one man in one era, and came out STILL orthodox but convinced it was many men and different eras.  Jacob Wright at Emory, DuDu Cohen in Israel, Zev Farber, David Steinberg, Marc Brettler, James Kugel.

So of course teach the traditional view of where Torah comes from.  Privilege it in some way even.  But let the modern biblical critics spend a year on what they think, and why they think it.  The evidence.  And let the critics come from inside the community – as they more and more do.

Teaching tradition, values, aspirations – certainly.  

But the model currently employed is not one anyone can consider legitimate.  The intellectual walls of the shtetl are quite high (and the boasting about how the haredim have everything right very pervasive) – and it’s not to keep people away from smut – it’s to keep them from thinking about anything they are taught.

Even the goyim would call this a “show trial.”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, someone actually reads what I write?

We are not indoctrinated as such in to all sorts of beliefs.  In Western society can believe as you wish, just respect the obligation not to force others to have the same beliefs. We live in an open society.  We have liberals, libertarians, communists, progressives, conservatives. We have gay dads and interfaith couples, etc.

We have bookstores like Barnes and Noble where you can read about atheism and go one shelf over and read about Judaism.  You can read about communism, and Nazism, and Zionism and capitalism.

You get my point.  Or do you?  You seem to feel strongly that controlling the education of haredi youth is the same as what goes on in the larger world, where evaluating different views, arguments, facts is standard.  Where “open inquiry” is not a dirty couple-of-words. 

Why is the haredi community kept on such a tight leash?  Why is it “bad for shidduchim” for haredi young people to go to college?  Why are there threats of your kids being kicked out of school if dad wears a blue shirt, not a white one?

You think control of this kind is fine, important, normal.

I KNOW why it goes on: because the haredi world would lose control of the community and the whole system of halachic Judaism would be fatally threatened if people were permitted to evaluate the topics their teachers assure them obviously come down on the haredi side.

Let me ask you a question: what are you smoking?  This by you is legitimate? Was it legitimate for true-blue communists to not permit travel abroard, ever, in order to maintain the communist world view?  What kind of legitimate power do you think inheres to those at the top?  The power of life and death over the woefully ignorant minions, kept poor by their leaders’ decisions?

OJ does not dare compete in the marketplace of ideas.  But it pretends to. It pretends that every BT discovered the truth of Torah.

It is cowardly and very weak.  Very sad.  But it works.  Just like the USSR worked.  As long as people can’t leave, are educated in manipulative and indoctrinating ways, are threatened with revoked privileges for their children for thinking or evaluating – yeah it works.

But it is the kind of power structure small men with napoleanic complexes find appealing. It is no wonder there is an agunah crisis.  Control, control, control.  It’s not the truth of Torah, it’s how damn good it feels to feel control.  It feels like you are winning the argument – like Fidel does sitting in Havana looking out over a country where every citizen is a prisoner.  But you are not winning anything.  You are just being a d&#038;*k.

Thanks for reading though – my cousins who are in kiruv would never read what I write.  They are the world’s most disgusting people on an intellectual level, but of course, like all kiruv rabbis, absolutely lovely and warm.  Yawn.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tuvia, we have heard this argument from you a number of times on different blogs.  Maybe you have a better solution? Is it wrong to teach ones children certain beliefs?

It seems that according to your philosophy, any dogma about anything cannot be presented as &quot;better than&quot; any other.  You use the world &quot;indoctrination&quot; as if it is a dirty word.  Our society indoctrinates us from birth to give all sorts of authority to certain beliefs, opinions, values, and attitudes.  The frum world may have different dogmas, but the approach is the same as any other society.

		<description><![CDATA[the idea that some ideas are too dangerous is a good part of the reason why the orthodox world won&#039;t let outside voices be heard on a number of issues.


What i think is cowardly (and also a kind of bullying) is when the charedi world decides to present &quot;both&quot; sides of an argument, and does a shoddy job at presenting the opposition, then just smashes it with the traditional view. &quot;You see?&quot; they say, &quot;you heard both sides, and our side wins!&quot;


It&#039;s actually what the communists did when they said &quot;communism is obviously superior and the truth&quot; and the &quot;West is decadent and classist and weak&quot; -- but no one could travel abroad to see for themselves, or evaluate any material from the outside world.


in this regard, the charedi world is cowardly.  All good indoctrination pretends to educate you on both sides of an argument, and that&#039;s what is behind the charedi education paradigm.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A while back, while browsing through Youtube, I came across a video of a preacher discussing atheism in front of a crowd of church goers. He was so good, that after watching it I almost found myself agreeing with him, despite a lifetime of living in a community that ridiculed belief in Jesus and years of identifying with the atheists he was insulting.


I think there&#039;s a lot of value in learning about ideas we disagree with. When it involves actual people speaking to an audience, though, you have to be aware that speaking and debating is an art that has almost nothing to do with facts and arguments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;An argument was made by Rabbi Goldberg and others that some ideas are too dangerous to discuss.&quot;

You are *completely* mischaracterizing Rabbi Goldberg&#039;s position. Completely. Go back and read his blog post again, but read it more carefully/closely this time. Here is the link - http://rabbisblog.brsonline.org/judicious-platform/

1. The title is &quot;Being Selective When Lending our Microphone&quot;, it is an accurate thumbnail description of what the post is about.

2. Here is a salient excerpt - &quot;To be clear, I have no objection to inviting divergent voices on the Israeli Palestinian issue, including people advocating on behalf of the Palestinian narrative and perspective.  What I do object to is the foolishness of petitioning for an invitation to someone who praises terrorists who wantonly murder innocent people and supports those who seek the complete abolition of the State of Israel.&quot;

3. And more - &quot;We exclude them not because we are threatened or scared of them or because we lack the confidence that we can provide a compelling rebuttal to them.  We exclude them because they simply don’t deserve the publicity or legitimacy that including them would provide.&quot;

4. And more - &quot;My objection to Khalidi speaking has nothing to do with fear or hesitation to hear other opinions or perspectives and a lack of confidence in our own. As a person who celebrates terrorists such as the leader of the Munich massacre, to give him a platform undermines the most basic concepts of justice, mercy, fairness and the value of life that our Torah mandates we teach the world.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s the old question that intolerant people ask: is it tolerant to not tolerate intolerance? I just read an answer given by a.very famous chareidi rabbi. Someone asked him if Abraham Lincoln can be consider a good person. He answered that he died too late, explaining that he has issue with Lincoln because he signed the abolition of slavery too early. It should have waited 50 or 100 years more in order to give time to the black Africans to civilize. And he goes on about Blacks in Africa, describing them as just a bunch of wild murderers. I saw through his words and other writings of his own only one thing : Racism. Anyway he was invited to speak everywhere, and he&#039;s even recognized as a tzaddik. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Thus, Rabbi Lamm concludes that American public schools should teach Communism.&quot;

Teach and learn about, of course. But Rabbi Lamm was not in favor of inviting Che Guevara to speak to his student body. The argument you are presenting is using a completely false analogy.

You study something, even evil things, in order to understand them. And to hopefully gain an ability to fight against the evil things. But to study and understand doesn&#039;t require the actual presence of specific representatives of an idea (as orthodox Jews, that is something we practice every single day when we learn from writings of our great rabbis, those that are already dead and those that are still alive).

And, even without actually hearing the words directly from Che Guevara&#039;s mouth, he and some of his ideas were nevertheless fetishized for decades by teens and young adults (and some older ones that never grew out of it). How much stronger would the effect had been if he were permitted to speak at high schools and colleges across the nation?
