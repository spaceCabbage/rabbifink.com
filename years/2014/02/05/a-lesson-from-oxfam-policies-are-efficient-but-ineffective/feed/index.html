		<description><![CDATA[The bigger problem with OXFAM and the like, IMHO, is that they are determining what is better for other people without those people&#039;s input. Have they surveyed the Arabs in the area to see what they would prefer? Have the residents chosen or voted for OXFAM to act on their behalf?
Maybe they feel the Arabs there are unable to make intelligent choices? Or that they as Westerners are far superior (even godlike)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good analysis. There is plenty of tamudic precedent for such analysis, most notably in this context the statement that &quot;many tried the method of rashbi, and it didn&#039;t work&quot; (about not getting a profession.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s worse than that. If it were owned by an Israeli Muslim, he would have no problem with it. There are thousands of businesses owned by Israeli Muslims there. The only problem he has is that it is owned by an Israeli Jew.


Their problem is Jews ... it almost always is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s also a certain anti-zionist line of reasoning to Oxfam&#039;s policy.  Even if you accept everything that he says as true, in the light and understanding most flattering, what his basic claim boils down to is that an Israeli can&#039;t own land in Palestine.  Well, why not?  Would he say the same thing about a Palestinian in Israel?   It&#039;s a private business.  If SodaStream was a Palestinian owned company, there&#039;s obviously no problem with its location. So the difference is that it&#039;s a private business owned by an Israeli.  What if SodaStream offered to buy the land the factory sits on from the PA or some identified former &quot;owner.&quot;  That would necessarily have to be OK to Oxfam (if they were being consistent), but you get the feeling it wouldn&#039;t be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ben Philips, the Oxfam representative in this video, appears to be a very ineffective spokesperson. Seems like all he can do is repeat the talking points that he&#039;s been trained to parrot about the settlements. And that is a criticism that stands regardless of the fact that the talking points aren&#039;t quite accurate to begin with.]]></description>
