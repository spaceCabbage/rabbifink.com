		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have the source for this, but Seth Godin discusses how Mormons do tremendous amounts of analysis and testing. For example, they discovered that by asking whoever answers the door if they would be willing to say a prayer with them, those who agreed to it were exponentially more inclined to convert. Instead of 1 in 1,000 the number goes down to 1 in 7 (not accurate numbers but I remember a remarkable contrast). So they implemented a strategy to always ask to say a prayer and not waste time on trying to convert those who would be less likely interested. Brilliant stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Intressante. There is definitely a kinship [superficially - not actually] between the Mormons and us heimishers. But the reason I find them more closely aligned with Chabad is because
1) both were molded by charismatic leaders to a greater extent than other Christians or orthodox Jew
2) Both believe themselves to be part of the greater whole, but both are suspected by others as being a cult. [famous joke they say, what&#039;s the closet religion to Judaism? Not Islam - chabad.]
3) Both are big into missionaires, though Chabad calls it outreach
4) Both were earley adopters of technology for religious purposes.
Anyway, its fun to hack around on a light subject once in a while.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not really analogous because
1) different markets-  to gain &quot;converts&quot; Orthodox Jews have to appeal to liberal Jews who aren&#039;t particularly interested in being frum- and strict conversion rules make non-Jews essentially off limits.  So orthodox Jews can only grow through having more children than anyone else, not through converts in any sense of the word. 
2) living as an Orthodox Jew is MUCH harder than being in Mormon in day to day ways (shabbat,kashruth) at least if you&#039;re not used to it and/or don&#039;t live in place with major Orthodox community.
3) as a result of 1 and 2, I suspect orthodox Jews more geographically concentrated than Mormons]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with DF, and in fact the first thing I thought of reading your post, Rabbi Fink, was about how Chabad was the first frum group to embrace the internet for its purposes!  Well, I&#039;m not sure I agree with DF on everything - I would say that perhaps &quot;Modern Orthodox&quot; - &quot;Jesuit&quot; and I don&#039;t know that Reform is Protestant as much as perhaps UU.  But definitely the Chabad comparison is apt.  And BTW I&#039;m sorry, but I&#039;m not taking any advice on lifestyle from as sexist a culture as LDS...we need less of that in MO, not more.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good article, but there are so many unbridegeable differences between orthodox Jews and Mormons, so as to limit - not to say preclude - us following their examples on anything.
Agav, I would refine the comparison a little. For every Christian sub denomination, there is a comparable Jewish one.
Catholics - Orthodox
Protestants - Reform
Amish - Chassidim
Mormons - Chabad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;We don’t even try to obtain data, let alone use data in our policy making.&quot;

From an excerpt of Dr. Aharon Hersh Fried&#039;s article in the Summer, 2013 Hakirah, &quot;Absent proper research, the community is unable to construct a methodically sound and consistent approach to addressing any of its challenges. In order to demonstrate the value, and in fact the necessity, of quality research in addressing community challenges, I offer here an in-depth, research-based analysis of the “children at risk” phenomenon. This discussion is intended to serve as an example of how a given challenge can be explored in a manner that leads to meaningful opportunities for legitimate solutions. I trust the reader will find this a valuable exercise.&quot;

Also see &quot;More Information, Please&quot; by Jonathan Rosenblum in Mishpacha(1/30/08), &quot;Yet it remains crucial to get some hard data, based on high quality research, to understand the interrelationship of different factors, and which ones are most prevalent&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This reminded me of a post from last June(&quot;Modesty Messages from a Mormon&quot;):

&quot;In many ways Mormons are like American Orthodox Jews. We share many values and our lifestyles are very similar. One thing that we share is the emphasis on modesty...One thing Mormons do at the tender age of 19 is they go on Missions. We have Project SEED programs. It’s basically the same idea...&quot;

&quot;It’s true that we can offer a more reasonable set of beliefs that remain true to Orthodox Judaism than what is commonly held now. But it may not be as great a factor as quality of life.&quot;

There is merit in focusing on social issues(the  intellect vs. social or emotional  is also brought up in discussions of causes of the OTD phenomenon).

 It&#039;s also worthwhile noting in connection with &quot;what is commonly held now&quot; that during the 1960&#039;s and 1970&#039;s, the makeup of the yeshiva world was different, and certain ideas were more acceptable. In the October, 2013 Torah Umaddah Journal( &quot;History and Nostalgia: The Rise and Fall of the Yavneh Organization During the late 20th century&quot;, pg. 214), Dr. Yoel Finkelman interprets  the evolution of both the right and the left, that  &quot; the right was not defeating the left, but the two sides of Orthodoxy were growing simultaneously, were constantly defining themselves through their disagreements with the other&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you.  I love Mormons.   Strangely, for them, when you grow up in an out of town community (meaning, anywhere outside Utah), there is more demand for ideological purity.  People meet with their Bishop (this is a rotating position) every 6 months and he asks them explicit questions about their lifestyle and beliefs.  If you fail that interview or admit to heterodox thoughts or behaviors and if you fail to show up at church, you could be put on probation.  In Utah, lots of people are Jack Mormons.  They come from Mormon families and they are Mormon by culture, but they don&#039;t necessarily follow the rules and no one feels a need to kick them out. 
Other interesting things about Mormons -- like us, they don&#039;t think everyone else is going to Hell.  They promote their religion *even though* you can get to Heaven without being Mormon.  Unlike us, they don&#039;t believe in day school -- everyone should go to public school and be a shining example of Mormon values.  They have a form of shomer negiah, but you are allowed to have boyfriends and even hold hands with them at some point.
Unlike us, they have a prophet who is in direct contact with G-d.  This makes it possible to change things (like racism) through revelation.  Unlike us, they think G-d has a physical body.  They also think G-d is married.  They also think that G-d was once a human being in a different universe.
If you think there is only one G-d for our universe but there are other god for other universes, is that shituf or  avodah zara or something else entirely?  I&#039;ve never been able to understand where Mormonism falls in Jewish categories for other religions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Let’s test whether limited Internet access and digital libraries will help our Yeshiva students and Kollel members be more productive and more prolific.

More productive? What are they producing? How many more seforim of strained chidushim and convoluted vertlach do we need?

Anyway, the point of Kollel is not to produce anything concrete. If it’s for anything, it’s to rack up points in Heaven for Klal Yisrael, for which purpose the academic quality of the learning and breadth of knowledge of the learner is irrelevant. In fact, now that I think about it, what’s praised as the most spiritually uplifting isn’t the guy who gets everything the first time around. Sure, he’s impressive, an iluy, but it’s the guy who sits and struggles with the meforshim who’s racking up the most points. In which case, knowing less may actually cause yungerliet to be more productive.

&#062; The reason we cherish old ideas is because we think that they are good ideas. 

In the frum world, we cherish old ideas because of the mistaken belief that all of these ideas were handed down to Moshe on Har Sinia. 

&#062; The interesting thing about Mormonism is that it’s actually the fastest growing religion in more than half of states in America. 

And you think that’s because people like the Mormon lifestyle? Your probably right, but can people really look at the nice lifestyle and conclude that Joseph Smith was a prophet instead of the con-man and cult leader he obviously was? Do you think they convince themselves in order to justify the downsides of a Mormon lifestyle?

More importantly, should the frum world be selling its lifestyle as a reason to be frum? It seems underhanded, a bait-and-switch tactic. Show off the nice lifestyle, and once the mark is hooked, only then slowly reveal the ridiculous things you have to profess belief in to be part of the community that supports his new lifestyle.]]></description>

What about the kinds of sins that can only be committed by two people together?]]></description>
