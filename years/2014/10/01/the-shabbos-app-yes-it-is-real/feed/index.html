		<description><![CDATA[So, as I noted in a comment written a month after the post, a few weeks after this conversation began, the Shabbos App morphed into a totally different claim, one which actually could be written for Android. (Although just claiming they were working on the first version, or that they had iOS experts working on a non-Apple version, displayed a lack of necessary knowledge to develop an app.)

However, at last word, on Oct 22, the promised delivery date was Dec 1. No word since, despite a deadline overrun of nearly 100%.

Who is still convinced the development effort ever was real?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On a different note, and this observation on the tech side of things belongs more here than on the follow-up. You write: &quot;A lot of people think it&#039;s a hoax. It&#039;s not. It&#039;s very, very real.&quot; I was wondering how you know that?


The app that was allegedly being developed at the time you wrote that promised a few impossible things, like having a cycle for charging, so that the battery doesn&#039;t always charge when plugged in. No Android app can do that -- although perhaps it could be written on a model by model basis for each cell phone by doing an end-run around Android. But then, the result wouldn&#039;t be an Android app, and wouldn&#039;t be distributable on Google play. The feature was dropped. Was this because O wasn&#039;t the only one to point this out, or because they proceeded far enough to realize it was not doable.

Also, they write, &quot;We are working with a team of highly skilled programmers for both  android  and Apple phones (this project  however, is not for iOS).&quot; All Apple phones run iOS. So they&#039;re either telling you they staffed up for a non-existent Apple non-iOS version of their software or that their developers are good at iOS development even though that&#039;s irrelevant. The implication is the former -- the knowledge of the field is so weak that they didn&#039;t realize they made a self-contradictory claim.


In any case, the App as now promised will provide a way to text anything you can from a menu of 150 words. It is unclear which texting networks (SMS, MMS, FB, AIM, etc...) they&#039;ll be supporting. A far more reachable goal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Except that he&#039;s &quot;cutting the message&quot; on Shabbos. Bad metaphor, since cutting something to shape raises its own Shabbos problem. So hedging back from your comparison a bit... The message didn&#039;t exist before Shabbos, the various letter-shaped islands of light-blocking crystal are being made on Shabbos. One really is writing on Shabbos.

Second, what you&#039;re doing would be visible without the back-lighting (ever see a Kindle or an LCD watch?). I would just be more difficult to see.

Last, even putting two or more pre-existing  letters next to each other to make a word is problematic. The only reason why Scrabble is permissible is because they would just slide off if you let them. In fact some (fortunately not my rabbi) prohibit playing the travel edition on Shabbos.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark, your analysis defies halachic categories. The basic problem is that you&#039;re trying to coin your own jargon rather than using the terms already in play, which reflect the actual categories and rules of the field.



The first issue you raise is pesiq reishei vs melakhah she&#039;einah tzerikhah legufah vs gerama vs permissible. Which is not a matter of being &quot;active&quot; but of how one defines intent, and how one defines a single action vs multiple actions.



Thermostats are both time delayed and far from inevitable. This is what makes them different than the textbook case discussed by the gemara and rishonim -- opening the door near a lamp which may be blown out either by the door&#039;s draft or a normal wind. Or, the automatic door sensor. Both the candle and the door of which lack the time delay and are pretty much inevitable.

Sitting on the sofa in front of a TV isn&#039;t a matter of &quot;active&quot;. It&#039;s a matter of whether the tunability of a TV puts it under the legislation banning musical instruments. (And for Ashkenazim, whether just the fact that it&#039;s a sound-making device would.) And also which weekday activities seem so un-Shabbos as to be prohibited as uvda dechol.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Active&quot; is only an approximate English term.  You can&#039;t lawyer it, Mark.  We&#039;re allowed to benefit from things running on electricity provided that we don&#039;t do any melacha or shevut on Shabbat.  There are some other limitations, like the rules of amira l&#039;Akum, but that&#039;s basically it.  There&#039;s also intent to be factored in.  We don&#039;t have to hide away from electrical things, but we can&#039;t deliberately engage them, either.

Furthermore, you&#039;re assuming universally held positions where they aren&#039;t.  Not everyone holds that you can&#039;t open and close the house door.  There are differences of opinion about Shabbat elevators, too.  If you open the door, it may or may not make the A/C turn on or off sooner or later.  You as an individual have no way of even really seeing what effect the change in door state has, or &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; it has any at all.  Ditto with Shabbat elevators.  With a fridge light, you know very well that if you open the door, the light will come on.  If you close it, the light will turn off.  And what&#039;s more, this is how you want it to work.  Your intent is for the light to come on so that you can see things in the friidge, and your intent is for it to turn off so that the head from the lamp doesn&#039;t adversely affect your refrigerated food, and so that you don&#039;t have a higher power bill.

Now... if you set up a camera to record yourself and others in your house on Shabbat, it&#039;s entirely different from a case where the city has set up cameras on the streets and you may or may not be recorded.  Again, it&#039;s an issue of intent and benefit and direct causation.  Lots of variables that enter into a decision.

Leaving on the TV before Shabbat so that you can see it on Shabbat.  No one, not even the most machmirim of machmirim, say that this is a melacha or shevut.  But there are halakhas regarding things that are inappropriate behavior on Shabbat.  This &quot;shabbos app&quot; does not fall into that category, of course.  It is clearly shevut at the very least, and melacha, probably, in a number of issues.  Is there &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; a question of it being inappropriate for Shabbat?  Absolutely.  Is that the primary issue?  Absolutely not.

When you have an electric door and you know that walking up to it will open the door, it&#039;s like the fridge light.  It&#039;s a direct consequence of your action, and you take that action for the purpose of causing that consequence.]]></description>

Absolutely not.</p>
<p>When you have an electric door and you know that walking up to it will open the door, it&#8217;s like the fridge light.  It&#8217;s a direct consequence of your action, and you take that action for the purpose of causing that consequence.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess it all depends on how you define &quot;active&quot;. We&#039;ve defined active to not include opening and closing the house door which allows humidity and heat in and caused the A/C to run more than it normally would have. Same for the fridge door. And same for video cameras or other security devices. We&#039;ve defined active to not include setting timers to do such things for you on shabbat.


But, on the other hand, we&#039;ve defined active to include sitting on the sofa if the TV or radio happens to be on. And perhaps we&#039;ve even included walking into a room with a TV/radio on in the definition. And we&#039;ve defined active as including walking into the range of a door sensor that automatically opens a door.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reminds me of the joke I once heard for allowing smoking on Shabat:
a. A Reform Rabbi was asked if one is permitted to smoke on Shabat?
     YES. Actually, one should never smoke, but if you smoke on weekdays, 
      then you may also smoke on Shabat.
b. A Conservative Rabbi was asked the same question.
     YES.  You may not smoke in shul, but at home it is okay.
c. Finally, an Orthodox Rabbi was asked.
     YES.  Provided that you sell your lungs to a non-Jew before Shabat.]]></description>

Do you have children?  I&#039;m curious, because as a parent, if my child were to say, &quot;Oooo, Mommy, I saw this toy and I really need it!&quot;, I&#039;d have to be a really garbage mother to conclude from that that the toy is a necessity.

And you yourself brought up the more common case yesterday, the case of alarm sensors in one&#039;s home. While it is true that frum Jews don&#039;t activate their alarm system on Friday night, it is also true that they do not disconnect the power (it&#039;s not even possible, because if you do disconnect power, the battery backup kicks in) to those systems and thus the sensors are still running all through shabbat.

		<description><![CDATA[Except that they can *not* use it without breaking Shabbat.  That&#039;s the whole point.  People who use a smartphone on Shabbat need to stop.  In the Christian bible, Paul claims that the Torah made him sin, because if things weren&#039;t forbidden, he wouldn&#039;t have sinned by doing them.  That&#039;s an incredibly immature and bass-ackwards way of looking at things, but it&#039;s the same rationale that you and others are using here.  The solution to rule breaking is to try and stop it.  Not to get rid of the rules so that people can feel better about their actions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;To the more recent generation(s), it is. That is, in fact, the main reason we are having this discussion.

Ya well, most of them are morons. Sorry. Most of them think it is a necessity because they are being bombarded with these social messages. I agree they are a necessity if they are conducting business - which you would have cease on shabbat anyways -  but most of the new generation is not conducting business all the time. Im curious how much of the app industry is really geared toward an actual necessity vs otherwise. 

&#062;No, it wouldn&#039;t be that simple..

Well, it doesn&#039;t have to AS simple, but the point for it is that there IS an option to turn off. And if you have the capability for such technology, I don&#039;t see any reason why that can&#039;t utilize such technology for an off button. I mean, really, does that home HAVE to have background sounds? Even my AC has duel functions for manual or timer.  

&#062;Do you know any that turn their main electrical breaker off before shabbat?



No, but that is passive. With electrical breakers being on, doesn&#039;t mean I am actually personally utilizing the electricity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To you and me, a smartphone is not a thing of necessity. To the more recent generation(s), it is. That is, in fact, the main reason we are having this discussion now.

And I agree, in Israel, because of the widespread demand, such systems will be designed to be turned off (or more likely modified) for shabbat. I loved my Tadiran Apollo fridge with it&#039;s built-in shabbat switch! Of course, when remodeling my kitchen, I made sure to buy a KitchenAid with a shabbat switch (in fact, I got all KitchenAid appliances that were approved by Star-K).

&quot;It would be no different than turning off the lightbulb in your fridge.&quot;

No, it wouldn&#039;t be that simple.. Today, a fridge is a stand-alone item that is separate from the functioning of the house. What I am describing are systems that are integral to the house - you would not be able to live in the house without them, nor is there even a way for them to be completely turned off. Do you know any frum Jews that turn off their HVAC systems before shabbat? Do you know any that turn their main electrical breaker off before shabbat? It will be at that level of integration*.

* It will *HAVE* to be at that level of integration for it to work properly and be accepted as the &quot;standard&quot; way of life.]]></description>
