		<description><![CDATA[He was the only one I saw, and I looked for others after reading your post and did not see any.  My mistake.  Either way Obama&#039;s actions, including lack of additional funds when they are sorely needed, decry supporting Israel.  He would never stand for rockets falling on the US and he needs to stand by his ally when they move to put an end to it.  


Also, please explain Kerry&#039;s comments that Israel upset Gaza and brought out the rockets by arresting terrorists in connection with the kidnapping.  Are they blind, stupid or have Alzheimer&#039;s?  The rockets have never stopped even after the 2012 ceasefire.  He represents the administration which clearly views Israel as the aggressor, something no recent President has done.  To ask for thanks to Obama is like asking to someone to say thank you to an armed robber for only shooting him in the arm and stealing everything and not killing him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t get it. You think Obama&#039;s such a friend to Israel, because he concedes they have the right to defend themselves? That&#039;s the test by which you determine friendship?
I agree with SS. Maybe he&#039;s not (and maybe he is) anti Israel, but he&#039;s done nothing that deserves thank you&#039;s. If you feel the need to thank someone or something, thank the U.S. Congress. Any monetary funding comes from them, not the White House. And its their members that have been unequivocal in their support of Israel.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem with your argument, Rabbi, is that inherent in President Obama&#039;s feeling that he needs to call on Israel to show &quot;restraint&quot; is the idea that--absent his call--Israel would not show restraint.  It is thinly veiled language that casts Israel as having the nature of an aggressor.  I am grateful to the President for the Iron Dome system, but if he were truly pro-Israel he would have merely stated, &quot;Israel has an obligation to defend its citizens against terrorist attacks emenating from Gaza.  PERIOD.&quot;  I&#039;m sorry, Mr.  President, but I&#039;m not voting for you again. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is quite disturbing how you can distort the truth in your favor and then claim millions have &quot;contrived their opinions&quot;.  Your statement about an orthodox Jew going on Foxnews and calling the Obama administration anti-jew and anti Israel are mistaken in fact.  Mr. Brafman, who is far more intelligent than you, and certainly more thought out, stated that the administration has been funding Hamas through the PA and it needs to be stopped.  Additionally, he added that Obama needs to gain the courage to stand up and say &quot;I back Israel 100%&quot;. His comments were based on the logic that no other country would even attempt to limit civilian casualties when defending itself, including the US, and yet Obama is demanding that of Israel.  Knowing that civilians are being used as human shields the IDF has taken every step possible to minimize civilian casualties.  A call for restraint is not always appropriate and with the amount of rockets currently being fired at Israel, a call for restraint is not appropriate.  I for one fail to see the logic of asking for restraint, when but for the Iron Dome, thousands of Israeli civilians would be dead.  Has anyone asked Hamas to exercise restraint?


This does not mean that he is anti-Israel per se, but the statements made on behalf of this government have been contradictory and hypocritical throughout.  In my opinion Obama has other motives, in as much as he has other motives in how he handles other terrorist regimes.  A country that doesn&#039;t recognize terrorist organizations should have defunded the PA as soon as Abbas created a coalition with Hamas, but they didn&#039;t.  They should have demanded accountability, and tracked where their money was being spent (it was obviously not on civilian infrastructure), but they don&#039;t.  They chase after every American company they give money to, for any reason demanding accountability, foreign aid should be no different and quite frankly should be held to a stricter standard.  Funding cancer research shouldn&#039;t have to answer for the extra lunch they bought a doctor to try and woo him when millions are being funneled to foreign countries to spend on anti American propaganda.


His actions speak louder than his words, and his actions do not show support for Israel in a time of need.  Anit Israel - maybe, maybe not  Pro-Israel - hard to argue that he is pro Israel today, but that does not mean he doesn&#039;t view them as a strategic partner and won&#039;t send funds when needed.  He may, but that is hardly a testament to true support of his only ally in the region.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And you think the people who are concerned with this issue don&#039;t actually believe in it, and have just &quot;contrived&quot; it? Why are they raising it, then? It has very limited PR value. It&#039;s obvious they are sincere in their beliefs. (That&#039;s not to say I think that they&#039;re sincere, but wrong; for all I know they are 100% right in their concerns. I&#039;ve never really studied the issue closely, and I would suspect neither did you.)]]></description>

Remember Abbas is part of FATAH then PLO! they got thousands of jews blood on their hand!
The Problem with the Ashkenazy Jews with all the respect is that you guys never lived in a Muslim Society nor with Muslims, therefore you are not aware of the true intention of Muslims...
I don&#039;t see any difference between Fatah PLO and any other Muslim Terror organization.]]></description>

Such arrogance. Just because YOU personally love Obama doesn&#039;t mean that the MILLIONS of people who love Israel but yet dislike this president have &quot;contrived&quot; their reasons. Have the moral decency to acknowledge that you, if you consider yourself orthodox, are very much in the tiny minority of orthodox Jews who support Obama.

		<description><![CDATA[Abbas in a moment of madness signed up with Hamas, no one can say why for certain; one thing is for sure he made a huge mistake.He is incapable of signing anything with Israel , he is scare of his own shadow.There will never be a bilateral agreement except if the ISIS Caliphate poses an even greater danger to the Palestinians.
I sense some form of unilateral withdrawal will be contemplated]]></description>
