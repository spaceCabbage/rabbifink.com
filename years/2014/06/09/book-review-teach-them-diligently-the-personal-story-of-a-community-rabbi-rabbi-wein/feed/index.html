		<description><![CDATA[&#062;It’s a testament to the writer of a memoir when a reader can feel a connection to the writer and see their own life and struggles in the writer’s.&#060;

I don&#039;t think so. This is one of the lowest forms of judging writing. It certainly doesn&#039;t say anything about the quality of a memoir.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read the book and I am a talmid of Rabbi Wein&#039;s.  I have two reactions to your ridiculous attack on the review: 1. I dare say that Rabbi Wein would enjoy the review and would be appalled by your intemperate response, and 2) how exactly did Rabbi Wein make his career by following in the footsteps of the Satmar Rebbe??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did not give reasons for the above, because they are obvious.  Rabbi Wein, in his thirties, would never have reviewed a book about, say, the Chafetz Chayim, and compared himself to him. Rabbi Wein also not only &quot;attended&quot; law school, he actually completed it, making law review, and practiced for nine full years. He also was in business, as a tool and die factory manager. In addition, he made his career by following in the footsteps of people like the Ponivicher Rav and the Satmar Rebbe - not Maya Angelou and the editor of Haaretz, or whoever else you admire.
Look, its not only you. Every young rabbi who speaks a decent English fancies himself the &quot;next Berel Wein.&quot; I&#039;ve been hearing that term for more than 20 years, and other people have probably heard it longer. Keep in mind that Rabbi Wein is a bona-fide genius. He&#039;s more than just a well-read rabbi. Its hard to say whether one appears more silly or vainglorious in attempting to compare oneself to him. You would have done better by limiting yourself to your first comments, that ALL of us will see similar parallels in their own life, especially Rabbis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You reminded me of my father&#039;s oft discussed but never completed research papers: The Deleterious Effects of Altitude on Human Fertility.

His idea was to randomly pick some community, for ease, he figured the Orthodox Jews of Monsey NY would do. Then he went around to the Vizhnitz, Yeshivish and Mod-O homes and check family sizes. He found that average family size decreased with altitude.

This provides a not-yet-explored avenue of treatment for infertile couples...]]></description>
