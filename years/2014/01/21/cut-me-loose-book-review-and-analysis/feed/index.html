		<description><![CDATA[I think what struck me most about the book was the absolute lack of information about and engagement with Judaism this woman had, whether in spite of or because of her particular upbringing.  At least, when men leave ultra-Orthodoxy, they tend leave for serious, intellectual reasons.  They realize that they can&#039;t square the Torah with science.  They realize that they want the freedom to learn new subjects.  They realize that the sources they were told had all the answers did not have the answers they needed.  
This woman was forced to leave Orthodoxy over a sweater.  A SWEATER.  She was forced out because she had written correspondence with a boy -- about IDEAS.  It says to me that the only thing -- the *only* thing that matters for a girl in these communities is modesty.  And by modesty, they mean that women should for all intents and purposes be invisible -- without thoughts, without feelings, without bodies, without ideas.  
Simply by speaking aloud or wearing a ribbon in your hair -- by doing anything -- anything at all -- that marks you as an individual -- you could be cast out.   Not only you, but your entire family.  Read the wrong book and your sister is forced to marry an asshole.  The entire system is built on shame.  The ideas may be beautiful, but we don&#039;t live in ideas.  We live in communities.  And there is nothing good about a community that tells a girl she is a filthy whore because she is wearing the wrong sweater.  Nothing.  Good.
We are judged by how we treat the most vulnerable among us -- the widow, the orphan, the stranger, the girl in the wrong sweater.  Apparently, one&#039;s standing the shidduch market is far more important than those sins.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi! I need the extra copy of the book, first I can&#039;t afford it-nada, zilch, really!. 2nd in my line of work I find myself in a position where many teenage girls in troubled situations open up to me and seek my guidance/support or simply open up to me because I don&#039;t judge them and I genuinely want to help them. I&#039;ve traveled a rough road myself and speak publicly about it, the girls feel more comfortable talking to me perhaps for that reason...This book will help me gain more understanding and perspective. What I also really want to read about in the book is how she made it out of the dark mess to being successful, what an inspiration! I would love to read the whole story to inspire myself and others.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The book says the sisters had been living there in the past but there was no indication they were there at the same time.  She keeps referring to the time &quot;when my sisters had been in NY&quot;.  


She says that was the pattern for all the single girls in her family, after a year in Israel, so to do otherwise would have aroused suspicion that something was wrong with her.  While she feels her parents were more &quot;generous&quot; with the sisters while they were single, she admits that they didn&#039;t &quot;coddle&quot; any of their kids.


She describes the time as being totally friendless, Jewishly.  Unlike her sisters she had no friends from seminary and she says she felt too shy to approach distant cousins for Shabbos meals.   I find it hard to believe that her parents, having found her an apartment and a job, wouldn&#039;t make a few calls to get her invited out for Shabbos meals, but that&#039;s the way she presents it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s any debate.  We haven&#039;t heard from the parents
.
According to the book, at age 17 when she finished her year in seminary (no, she was not kicked out or brought back early by her parents, despite the impression given on the Katie Couric show), her mother found her an apartment and a job in Brooklyn and expected her to be self-supporting.  Her older sisters went through the same experience; this was what the family expected from their daughters during the time between seminary and marriage.


While I wouldn&#039;t recommend letting a 17-year-old make their way on their own in NYC, she doesn&#039;t seem to have been singled out for punishment in this way.  If anything it reflects the family&#039;s poverty rather than their fundamentalism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you that we haven&#039;t heard the parents&#039; side of the story, except for an excerpt from the letter read on the Katie Couric&#039;s show.  However, I think that one can judge the book and its value as a memoir without judging the accuracy of all the facts contained in it.  (And I believe it has the standard &quot;Some events may have been modified&quot; disclaimer).  I think most intelligent people can read a book like this with the understanding that they are hearing only one subjective perspective, and focus on the narrative without playing detective about the facts.


I also wanted to add that Ms. Vincent did take some measures to protect her family&#039;s identity, by using a different name in the book.  Whether it was out of concern for them or under lawyer&#039;s advice, I don&#039;t know.  At this point the family&#039;s name is well-known.


I, too, would like to hear more from the family, but I don&#039;t expect to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The family&#039;s response was never heard in full. The courtrooms of the mind, to borrow Hanoch Teller&#039;s felicitous title, should reflect an actual court where a judge fully listens to both sides.  היו מתונים בדין

Also as I pointed  out, there is the way people perceive the family based on the alleged actions. One meaning of והוי דן את כל האדם לכף זכות  is to judge literally, the *entire* person, in addition to  the actions. Readers may not come up with a total picture of the family from her description. If the father is loving and  does kindness and chesed, that should be reflected in a review article, as well, as it is part of his character. From an article titled &quot;Torah Attitude: Parashas Emor: Judge the whole person&quot; by  Rabbi Avraham Kahn:

&quot;Judging the whole person--We have already mentioned that it says earlier in Pirkei Avos (1:6): &quot;And you shall judge everyone favourably.&quot; Some of the commentators point out that the literal translation is &quot;And you shall judge the whole person favourably.&quot; This teaches us that just as if we would take a passage from a book and read it out of context, we would not have a clear understanding of its proper meaning. The same thing happens if we take an individual&#039;s situation out of context without looking at the broader picture. We cannot properly judge a person in the present if we do not know his past. There is always more to a situation than at first appears. Often we really do not know the person that well. We do not know all the details of what is happening in the person&#039;s life at any particular time. By reminding ourselves that we do not necessarily know all the details we can train ourselves to always assume that there is a good reason why the person is acting contrary to our expectations. Just like the worker presumed that there were valid reasons why his employer had no money or property to pay his wages, we should assume that others have valid reasons for their behaviour as well. This is not an easy task. Most of us would flare up if we worked for three years only to be told that there was nothing left at the time to pay our wages. However, if we realize that we only see part of the whole person and his situation, we can understand that we cannot pass judgment, but must give the benefit of the doubt. As it says later (Pirkei Avos 2:5), &quot;Do not judge your fellow until you have reached his place.&quot; As long as you have not reached his place, i.e. have a clear picture of his complete situation, you must give him the benefit of the doubt.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My reaction is to defend Leah&#039;s parents, but it&#039;s not a knee-jerk Orthodox reaction. I was impressed with Leah&#039;s appearance on the Katie show; ironically, I thought, her idea of the beyond &quot;vilification/romanticization&quot;   theme at the recent  Federation sponsored Footsteps panel reflected well on, and is a credit to her parents.  I am in favor of  open, honest,  constructive, and appropriate  discussion about any and all issues  shared by the Footsteps community, no matter how sensitive--whether  issues in the Frum community  of an intellectual or a faith-related nature, sexual, or xenophobic, so long as the discussion is fair.

My concern is how her parents are perceived by readers of the subjective account of the book. First, just as in a divorce, there are also two sides to the story of Leah&#039;s relationship with her parents. But even if her parents erred, out of fairness, their side of the story, as well as their motives and intentions needs to be told, so that people do not conclude, as in the Wall Street Journal review, that &quot;Ms. Vincent never explains her parents&#039; vicious behavior....Her book should be read, not just as a warning of the very real dangers of the world, but also of the price to be paid when, in the name of religion, people forget humanity.&quot;

 A person can make parenting errors, if Leah&#039;s description of being overly strict is correct, and still have strengths and decent qualities. I hope such positive qualities are mentioned in the book. Also, just as a messy divorce should not be aired in public-- even if one side is correct--neither do I think should  issues concerning  a private parenting relationship be publicly aired.  Why cause pain to  Leah&#039;s family? There should be a way to raise legitimate and   important issues that are a concern to both the Frum and formerly Frum  communities without hurting one&#039;s family. And even if one feels  it&#039;s necessary to criticize one&#039;s family in print, it should at least  be in a way that minimizes harm to them.

I think  that the all or nothing, vilification/romanticization dichotomy that Leah correctly eschewed at the Footsteps/Federation event, should  likewise  apply to how people think of her family, no matter what  errors they may or may not have made.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My reaction is to defend Leah&#8217;s parents, but it&#8217;s not a knee-jerk Orthodox reaction. I was impressed with Leah&#8217;s appearance on the Katie show; ironically, I thought, her idea of the beyond &#8220;vilification/romanticization&#8221;   theme at the recent  Federation sponsored Footsteps panel reflected well on, and is a credit to her parents.  I am in favor of  open, honest,  constructive, and appropriate  discussion about any and all issues  shared by the Footsteps community, no matter how sensitive&#8211;whether  issues in the Frum community  of an intellectual or a faith-related nature, sexual, or xenophobic, so long as the discussion is fair.</p>
<p>My concern is how her parents are perceived by readers of the subjective account of the book. First, just as in a divorce, there are also two sides to the story of Leah&#8217;s relationship with her parents. But even if her parents erred, out of fairness, their side of the story, as well as their motives and intentions needs to be told, so that people do not conclude, as in the Wall Street Journal review, that &#8220;Ms. Vincent never explains her parents&#8217; vicious behavior&#8230;.Her book should be read, not just as a warning of the very real dangers of the world, but also of the price to be paid when, in the name of religion, people forget humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p> A person can make parenting errors, if Leah&#8217;s description of being overly strict is correct, and still have strengths and decent qualities. I hope such positive qualities are mentioned in the book. Also, just as a messy divorce should not be aired in public&#8211; even if one side is correct&#8211;neither do I think should  issues concerning  a private parenting relationship be publicly aired.  Why cause pain to  Leah&#8217;s family? There should be a way to raise legitimate and   important issues that are a concern to both the Frum and formerly Frum  communities without hurting one&#8217;s family. And even if one feels  it&#8217;s necessary to criticize one&#8217;s family in print, it should at least  be in a way that minimizes harm to them.</p>
<p>I think  that the all or nothing, vilification/romanticization dichotomy that Leah correctly eschewed at the Footsteps/Federation event, should  likewise  apply to how people think of her family, no matter what  errors they may or may not have made.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Rather, if someone is craving attention and they are acting on it, I think we can assume that this person is dealing with some sort of pain that needs love and care.&lt;/i&gt;

You said essentially the same thing in the previous blog post. I don&#039;t know if you realize how rare a phenomenon you are in your world.

&lt;i&gt;It seems that if they are seeking attention then they actually do need love and empathy. Why not give it to them?&lt;/i&gt; 

You know the rationale: &quot;Because that will encourage others to leave.&quot; (Meanwhile, if &quot;Toyreh&quot; represents absolute truth, why do they feel they need to defend it so vigorously? No one ever really addresses that one.)

You&#039;re a thoughtful man, but unfortunately, as I believe I told you recently concerning another issue about which you gave similarly excellent advice, your words will fall upon deaf ears.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These two quotes of yours are full of power and truth.  For these reasons, and more, I look forward to reading this book.  &quot;It’s impossible to read Cut Me Loose without considering how we can do better.&quot; And, &quot;I recommend this book because we need to tell those who have left three of the most powerful words in the English language: ”I hear you.”&quot;

Thanks for a great review.]]></description>
