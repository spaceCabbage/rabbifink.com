		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Have the decency to recognize that your youth, as well as perhaps your geographic location, may preclude you from seeing what older and more experienced people see clearly. &lt;/i&gt;

This is one of the most ridiculous, clueless, condescending comments I&#039;ve read online in quite a while. It isn&#039;t even worth deconstructing. The real problem is that the &quot;homosexual road&quot; is leading to a place that makes you uncomfortable - therefore, it&#039;s morally unacceptable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This paragraph, in particular, stood out for me:

&lt;i&gt;I believe the correct formulation should be as follows. No matter a person’s private activities, we love our fellow Jews. Those who are in pain or are outcasts deserve extra love and sympathy. It is far too common for LGBTs people to feel like outcasts. Our primary concern has to be their emotional welfare. We can’t allow our children, brothers, and sisters to feel like they are alone or disassociated from their families. That comes first. Their religious or spiritual welfare comes second and only long after concern number one is sufficiently satisfied.&lt;/i&gt;

If this were the way Jewish communities (frum or otherwise) worked, there would be far fewer lonely, alienated Jewish people of all ages and orientations in this society.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Social conservatives have made this one of their primary issues. I don’t claim to understand their reasoning or justification for this choice.&lt;/i&gt;

Years of observation have convinced me that it terrifies them as it forces them to confront their own latent  tendencies.

Excellent post, Rabbi. DovBear also ran a post about it: http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2014/01/yair-hoffman-thinks-quack-medical.html]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m surprised at the lack of depth in this post. It begins by referring to the viewpoint expressed in the article as a &quot;daas radio talking point.&quot; You are aware, are you not, that such a comment is itself a talking point, of the left, to convince themselves that conservative thinkers are nothing more than automatons aping what they hear on radio. Of course, that is no more true than referring to your left wing approach as merely copying the talking points of the New York Times. It was an insulting and ill-considered comment.

You talk about the &quot;horror stories&quot; of JONAH, as though that had any significance whatever. Surely you realize there are exponentially more horror stories coming out of the medical field, the psychotherapy field, the legal profession, the rabbinate, the federal government - there is nothing in the world which doesn&#039;t produce &quot;horror stories.&quot; Tellingly, you conspicuously ignore all the positive stories that have come by way of JONAH.

You then get into the strawman of &quot;dehumanizing LGBT people.&quot;  That doesn&#039;t even have any meaning. Show us where the article in question attempted to &quot;dehumanize&quot; homosexuals.

But all of this is mere nitpicking, compared to where this post really displays a shallow understanding of our society and where we are heading. The homosexual issue is, by itself, worthy of the push back from our community. (Contrary to your first commenter below, the midrashim do speak of sexual perverson as the basis for the flood, and of course, the well-known passage in Chullin specifically note that the gentiles do not permit homosexual marriage, a statement that speaks volumes.)  But the root of the homosexual marriage is not about homosexuality per se, but sexual abandon, period. The destruction of the family unit, and everything that stands for. Tradition, religion, God, higher purpose. 

Had the orthodox position been nothing more than miming social conservatives, you would see orthodox protests concerning abortion, which any evangelical will tell you is even a higher priority than homosexuals. But you don&#039;t see anything like that in the frum world on that, do you? You don&#039;t. It&#039;s barely even talked about in our circles. Because our opposition to the homosexual push is only co-incidental with the opposition of social conservatives, and not caused by it. Have the decency to recognize that your youth, as well as perhaps your geographic location, may preclude you from seeing what older and more experienced people see clearly. 

Wayne Gretzky became a great hockey player not because he knew where the puck was, but because he knew where the puck was going. Just so. Don&#039;t get caught up in Volokh&#039;s technicalities [none of which make any sense, but that is a different topic.] It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to knuckle-under to homosexual lobbying, and  convince and then congratulate himself that his position is out of a sense of justice, and not weakness. You should be standing up to applaud those with the foresight who see where the homosexual road is leading, and have the backbone to fight against it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The constant use of euphemisms like Toeiva or anti-Torah when referring to this particular issue and not to others is a baffling social phenomenon. I can think of at least a few dozen matters that deserve more attention and derision than this issue.&quot;

I think the use of &quot;Toeiva&quot; is at least partially done because of tzniyus sensitivities since the topic is sexually related. A similar euphemism used is &quot;deviant&quot;. Perhaps it is also done to counter the social acceptance of homosexuality, though I would argue that &quot;toeiva&quot; should be used for other issues as well, where mentioned in the Torah.

Regarding the general point, Rabbis Broyde and  Brody wrote similarly in the March, 2010 Jewish Press:


&quot; Ultimately, we are afraid that disproportionate condemnation of this phenomenon gives unproductive focus to a red herring, leading to inappropriate responses to individual struggles and distracting us from the central problems truly plaguing our community.&quot;]]></description>
