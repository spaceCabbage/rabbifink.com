		<description><![CDATA[The problem, as I see it, is that if Orthodoxy admits to picking up bits and pieces along the way it endangers the belief that it is the One True Judaism. As in , &#039;we do this because this is REAL Judaism, unlike those other fakes&#039;. And if that cherished belief of being the One True Judaism falters, that means that Conservative/Reform/etc are not by definition false Judaisms and may eve be (gasp!) valid streams of the same religion. And that would upset the apple cart liek woah for a lot of people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your comments have the flavor of a college freshman writing a term paper about an esoteric topic from total ignorance.


An examination of the texts of the written Torah to determine what is oral law without understanding the basic premise of oral law in that it was originally totally oral is certainly doomed to failure and is absolutely the wrong approach. In order to know what is oral torah one has to associate with the sages of the Torah that have carried the traditions of our holy people for generations. Any post facto superficial analysis is doomed to failure.


There was a point in Jewish history before the Mishna was written that everything in the Oral Torah was not written down and it was even forbidden to do so. What texts could be analyzed then?


The comment that statements in the Gemara are just boich sevaros is outrageous, demeaning to Torah and simply kefira of the first order. There is no basis to declare whether something is from Sinai or not except for our Oral tradition which dictates that it is. If you&#039;re outside of this, all your arguments are empty nonsense.


Your opinion that everything stems from the texts of the written Torah and without a reference there has no basis is simply ignoring the reality of the second half of Torah, the oral torah.


Your myth of divine revelation is the basis of all of Judaism and without that you have nothing because man is fallible. You are also ignoring myriad medrashim which indicate the primacy of the Oral Torah and if this is where you stand then call your fake religion some other name but it surely isn&#039;t Judaism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sadly, this is another of the myths that has become a pillar of today&#039;s folk Judaism.

If one simply examines the laws in the Mishnah, Tosefta, Sifra, Sifrei, Yerushalmi and Bavli, one quickly finds that almost nothing, (if anything) in the Gemara is from Sinai.

Even the few (31 or so?) halakhot that are called Halakha l&#039;Moshe MiSinai are simply laws not derived from the written Torah, that all agree on (but in reality, we see that there is no such agreement on all of them), and for which we have no source.

Like it or not, the Oral Torah is legislative and exegetical in nature, not revelatory. Hazal learned their laws in an exegetical fashion from the text of Tanakh and even from a few books that never made it into Tanakh.

I have yet to find anyone who is able to demonstrate otherwise with Hazalic sources. The Oral Torah is binding. We are commanded to obey the rulings of the Judges. This is a fact and it is in no need of myths of divine revelation to prop it up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow.  I&#039;m not even O and even I know that Mishna is Torah sheb&#039;al peh and Gemarrah is not.  That&#039;s why the Gemarrah has *names* attached to its statements.  What in the world are they teaching in yeshiva these day?  Gemarrah is be&#039;al peh?  Do you want to maybe try asking your Rav about that statement again?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This article seems to get very, very close to admitting that the rituals and customs that make up Judaism are manmade or adopted from other cultures. Once you start looking at and objectively analyzing the origins of particular customs, why stop at Schlissel challah? I don&#039;t mean to troll, but, to me, the distinction here seems awfully thin.]]></description>
