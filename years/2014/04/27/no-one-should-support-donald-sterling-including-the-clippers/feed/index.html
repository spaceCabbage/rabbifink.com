		<description><![CDATA[Yes statistically anything is possible and people can do a lot of things.  And obviously people can do most of that since most of it is happening, but is this policy enforced universally?  You are correct also in that not all opinions and preferences should be treated the same, for instance having one&#039;s privacy encroached upon and private thoughts recorded for the world to hear without consent is a larger infraction than possessing an unsavory opinion.  Those that cannot see that must be blinded by hatred.  Support who you like, and do what allows you to respect yourself, and allow others to do the same, but continue to seek understanding please.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anyone can possess opinions.  Anyone can have personal preferences.  But we the people do not need to treat all opinions or preferences equally.  Our government cannot imprison Sterling for his speech, but we the people can definitely demand his ouster.  His employers can fire him.  People can refuse to associate with him.  People can punish him socially and financially.  My personal preference is not to give my time, money, or acceptance to people like this or to anyone and anything associated with it.  Everyone is allowed those preferences and the vast majority of Americans prefer that someone like this not be associated with a major sports franchise.  America is not about avoiding the consequences of your actions and words.  Neither is Judaism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I most definitely support Donald Sterling.  Possessing opinions no matter how unpopular is a freedom we should have, as well as feeling safe in our own homes.  This man has been treated in an UN-American manner and that is a bigger crime than personal preference.  Shame on the media, shame on those being fooled here, shame on the opportunists (that most likely started this) and shame on those that recognize the injustice here and do not act.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe this Sterling matter is just a distraction from the fact that the Democrats and other so called liberals in Hollywood are about to take our internet.

The reality is that Harvey Levin from TMZ a gay Jew is doing the dirty work for liberal secular Jewish Democrats. This is the beginning of a Jewish liberal war on Republicans..

Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg are all Jewish supporters of Obama who as C.S Lewis referred to as the claasic do-gooders like we have come to expect from most left-wing liberals who want to rid the world of guns...upsized sodas and oil including the Keystone pipeline and a free internet.

We also know that a very Jewish and post hippy Hollywood descriminated against Conservative Script writers for over 30 years.

http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2011/07/13/hollywood-finally-admits-it-discriminates-against-conservatives-could-this-be/

What marks out the tyranny of the way these people operate is that which marks the left of politics and liberal donors.

http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/democrats-democracy-alliance-liberal-donors-105972.html

&quot;Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron&#039;s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.

C.S. Lewis&quot;

But essentialy these attacks on the freedom of the internet are about money and the operations of lobbyists, where....essentially Hollywood is behind the reforms to give away the last controls of the internet including the hire of the lobbyist Robert Holleyman.

http://boingboing.net/2014/04/23/obama-official-responsible-for.html

After a public outcry this decision to give away the last controls of the internet looks to be on hold but now the FCC is stepping in and destroying a free internet after failing to take control of newsrooms. They now are talking about a censorship fast lane.

http://act.boldprogressives.org/sign/sign_netneutrality_3things/?source=tw

This after the FCC  failed to put monitors and censors in every news room.

http://foxnewsinsider.com/2014/02/19/govt-monitors-newsrooms-fcc-look-media-decision-making

Americans need to realise how militant the left is and how influential these Liberal donors are. If they supported the giving away of the internet so that they could attack piracy behind the scenes then they likewise support attacks on a free internet and create the tools to enliven political censorship with the Obama administration working behind the scenes to attack opponents. These FCC reforms are part of this...moving into this direction.

We see how the Obama administration has used the federal beauracracy to attack opponents. Who is to say that this new FCC proposal for a fast lane will not use information supply with deals behind the scenes to do the same and attack political opponents. Obama is always meeting behind closed doors with the media or Silicon Valley giants. It will happen and it is a disgrace as Google has already proved itself to be left in politics. They are all do-gooder tyrants where we would be better off under robber barons.

What is Google and Facebook getting out of this new FCC proposal?

What we know for sure is that the left wing silicon valley giants cannot be trusted along with the FCC. They will use the do-gooder justifications to fight against piracy to take away a free internet and you can take that to the bank. Read the quote from C.S Lewis again.

If Hollywood can have this much clout....discriminate against conservative scriptwriters for so long and work together with Obama to take away a free internet then all should be concerned. This is an activity of so called do-gooders that believe they have the authority to strip all of us of our internet freedoms. Conservative Christians need to stand up to these secular liberals and secular Jewish do-gooders that have too much political clout in America.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R. Fink,

I&#039;m not sure how to understand this outcry.  All I heard him say was that &quot;he didn’t want his girlfriend to publicize her interactions with black people nor was she to invite black people to Clippers games.&quot;   I think he was getting grief from his friends on this as well.   I also think that he said that he loved black people. Admittedly, a certain amount of racism here - but not over the top.

Anyways - weren&#039;t you ever at yeshiva?  Did you never here the rebbeim speak disparagingly about the &#039;shvartzes&#039;  in particular and   the &#039;goyim&#039; in general?  I know I heard it many times.  Do you hold them to the same standard?  are they disgusting as well?  What am I missing?.  Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The hypocrisy in this post is just amazing. Just two posts ago you were singing the praises of Shir Hashirim. This poem, may I remind you, contains the famous line &quot;I am black, but I am beautiful&quot;, meaning that most blacks are ugly. [Every translation in the world has the &quot;but&quot;, don&#039;t try to claim otherwise.] Every tractate of the Talmud says far more racist things than ever Sterling said, and yet you study their words every day. Indeed, one hopes you are still against intermarriage - is your opposition to marrying a non-Jew any less race-based than Sterling&#039;s comments? What, does religion permit you to engage in racism?
And, pray tell, what exactly is wrong with Sterling&#039;s viewpoints, anyway? I want to hear some thinking here, not just following the herd. Sterling - and I assure you, tens of millions of others who&#039;ve just not been taped - doesn&#039;t like blacks. Blacks, no one denies, not the least other blacks, have their own sense of culture, argot, likes, dislikes, etc. Is Sterling expected to love all that? Why should he? Is he not entitled to his own cultural preferences, no less than you are entitled? How easy it is for an orthodox rabbi, cloistered among fellow Jews, who went to private school among other orthodox Jews his whole life, to tell other people how to live their lives. Precisely the type of thing other limousine liberals are rightly mocked for. Believe it or not, white gentiles have a culture of their own that they are interested in preserving just as you are. If you&#039;re not going to do the walk, don&#039;t talk the talk.
Now, had this been a question of actions, as opposed to opinions, I would have something else to say. But there is no proof at all of that. [And I trust you know far better than to cite mere allegations. There&#039;s not a good sized business in America today that doesn&#039;t receive allegations of various discrimination on a weekly basis. Why not, they&#039;re free to file with the EEOC, and you might get lucky by extorting a few thousand dollars in nuisance value from companies who have other things to do than fight the never ending stream of charges.] If Sterling actually denied Blacks entrance to games, I would have something else to say. But to state his opinions? You tell me why you&#039;re allowed to state yours, but he can&#039;t state his.]]></description>

And, pray tell, what exactly is wrong with Sterling&#8217;s viewpoints, anyway? I want to hear some thinking here, not just following the herd. Sterling &#8211; and I assure you, tens of millions of others who&#8217;ve just not been taped &#8211; doesn&#8217;t like blacks. Blacks, no one denies, not the least other blacks, have their own sense of culture, argot, likes, dislikes, etc. Is Sterling expected to love all that? Why should he? Is he not entitled to his own cultural preferences, no less than you are entitled? How easy it is for an orthodox rabbi, cloistered among fellow Jews, who went to private school among other orthodox Jews his whole life, to tell other people how to live their lives. Precisely the type of thing other limousine liberals are rightly mocked for. Believe it or not, white gentiles have a culture of their own that they are interested in preserving just as you are. If you&#8217;re not going to do the walk, don&#8217;t talk the talk.<br />
Now, had this been a question of actions, as opposed to opinions, I would have something else to say. But there is no proof at all of that. [And I trust you know far better than to cite mere allegations. There&#8217;s not a good sized business in America today that doesn&#8217;t receive allegations of various discrimination on a weekly basis. Why not, they&#8217;re free to file with the EEOC, and you might get lucky by extorting a few thousand dollars in nuisance value from companies who have other things to do than fight the never ending stream of charges.] If Sterling actually denied Blacks entrance to games, I would have something else to say. But to state his opinions? You tell me why you&#8217;re allowed to state yours, but he can&#8217;t state his.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;There are varying degrees of socially acceptable behavior. While the country is split on gay marriage, the country overwhelmingly rejects racism. This makes Eich’s behavior far less abhorrent than Sterling’s behavior&quot;



It&#039;s nice that you see the nuance difference in these two things, but certainly many on the Left saw Eich as a bigot and deserving of being tossed out. Much on the left see no difference between racism and disapproval of gay weddings. In fact, much of what you have written here was easily said by many on the Left against Eich and that we ought not show any tolerance toward his intolerance.....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is there a difference between personal feelings vs. how it affects practical public issues? Is there any evidence that his feelings against blacks affected anything? Personally, I am much more bothered by the blurring of the lines between the public and private spheres. That to me, is much more detrimental to some guy personally not liking black people. Unless I am missing something, this was caught on tape, not something said for the public. Hell, my grandfather has some some pretty bad things about black people, but when it came to actual treatment, he treats everyone the same. 


And where does it stop? What if someone likes everyone, but hates Germans, should we quit our jobs because we won&#039;t stand for anything less than perfect personal admiration for every race and ethnicity?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s easy to ask the employees to break their contract and probably invalidate it. But it&#039;s very tough for those employees to do so, especially when they have no other skills to fall back upon. Instead the request should be to THE FANS - in general people respond to money or lack thereof, so the local fans should avoid the games, simply stop attending them, I bet at least 50% of the attendees deplore racism and would do it. And nationally, it could also work to force the other owners/NBA to bring pressure on the situation, if only 10% of fans stop attending the games, they would act immediately.]]></description>
