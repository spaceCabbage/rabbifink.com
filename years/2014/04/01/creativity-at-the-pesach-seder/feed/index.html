		<description><![CDATA[Well, you could start with responsum OC #6 in the back of Shulchan Arukh haRav (if your Hebrew is up to it). The first Lubavitcher Rebbe, in trying to explain how not eating gebrockts (&quot;broken&quot; or other matzah that got wet) is so important, needs to explain what changed since the Baal Shem Tov. There are numerous stories of the Baal Shem Tov eating gebrochts on Pesach; even saying that it&#039;s part of the mitzvah of enjoying the holiday! It&#039;s hard for a chassidic rebbe to say that something the founder of chassidus did is prohibited. So, the SAhR explains that matzos were made slower and thicker back then, and the new rush job is what made the new custom mandatory.


Going back to THE Shulchan Arukh, which is well before the time in question but is illustrative, the Rama in his gloss covering Ashkenazi practice, sets the maximum height for matzah at 1 tefach. A 3.5&quot; high hard matzah would break teeth, but the truth is matzah wouldn&#039;t bake that way -- it would either be taken out soft, or the outside would burn. Similarly, the Rama records a custom to make a matzah using a measure called a &quot;soles&quot; of flour, which would make it about 56 times the volume of today&#039;s hand matzos. It is was of the same thickness, it would be hard to get through doorways and impossible to fit on the table.


Anyway, I recall seeing an article on it in print, perhaps Jewish Action (the OU organ). But Googling didn&#039;t turn up anything. The thinning of matzah was an early 19th cent thing, with the matzah getting progressively crisper as a consequence. Anyway, the Shlchan Arukh haRav is why I invoked the comparison to the start of chassidus.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[0- I get two seder plates, a big one in the middle of the table according to the Ari&#039;s layout you&#039;ll find in traditional haggados, one next to me that is actually used first which follows the halachic dictum that the first mitzvah should be closest to you. (So that you do not pass-over one mitzvah to reach for another. Pun intended.) There are other plates, as there is a lot of table, and boys get to pick their own layout for the plate at the far end of the table, but really I haven&#039;t gotten them to care. Yet.

1- Some Orthodox Jews may find this innovative, but little of our Magid is in Hebrew. I quote the pesuqim before translating them, but this is relaying Torah, not davening.  If most of the people at the table can&#039;t follow the original, it&#039;s simply a waste of time to bother with it and halachically one is only fulfilling the mitzvah with whatever is in the language they do understand.

Okay, except for Mah Nishtanah, Avadim Hayinu, Dayeinu, and other songs. Forgot that. Which leads to...

2- My father noted that we sing much of the hagadah, but one of the most famous paragraphs does not have one. So, we threw together a tune for it, and it became a family minhag. If you hear someone sing at their seder Bitechilah Ovedei A&quot;Z Hayu Avosainu (In the Beginning, Our Ancestors Were Idolaters), odds are they were at our table.

3- We have the Exodus story, from right before dam through leaving the next morning, in script form. It&#039;s acted out one night.

4- The other night we do the plagues: The youngest child pours water in a paper cup and it turns red (cherry jello mix is white, and blends in with the cup until wet), spring-loaded frogs, etc... Make sure to hold your glass for the ping-pong hail balls!

5- Koreikh (the Hillel wrap) is done with Syrian Matzah (www.softmatza.com ships, if you can&#039;t get to Brooklyn or Deal), so that we can actually wrap it. Bragging rights when school resumes. (I asked R&#039; Herschel Schachter, and can prove that historically, Chassidus is older than our current Ashkenazi cracker matzah.)

6- I look for the επί Κομός (afiqoman), as it&#039;s easier to intentionally not find a younger child&#039;s matzah than to find one that a half-asleep child lost. Problems with teaching them extortion noted, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We almost always finish by 12:30 or so. The kids (read this as &quot;I&quot;) need to get to sleep. In recent years, we&#039;ve been shrinking the meals so they don&#039;t take as long as they used to, besides, who needs to eat a heavy meal ending near midnight.


Two or three years ago, I hid the afikoman at my sister&#039;s house in such a clever location that it wasn&#039;t found until well after Shavuot. And my sister&#039;s house is always impeccably clean and orderly (unlike my house).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;we should try to find new and diverse ways for Orthodox Jews to experience their Judaism.&quot;


What kind of kofer are you anyway?! They call it &lt;b&gt;seder&lt;/b&gt; for a reason. Because it has an exact &lt;b&gt;order&lt;/b&gt; and an exact way of doing things. And those ways may never be modified. We&#039;ve been doing it that way for thousands of years and it&#039;s worked very well. Who are you to come along in your liberal ways and suggest changes to our holy mesora. Blah blah blah .....
