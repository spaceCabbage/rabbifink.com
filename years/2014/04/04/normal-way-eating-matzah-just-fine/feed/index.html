		<description><![CDATA[All those who are truly frum and follow the advice of R. Simcha Bunim who says to be as machmir as possible with achilas matzah on Pesach should be doing as follows.
Should be having two kezeisim like the Rosh says which are doubled like the Tzlach who says that are beitzim are smaller (essentially this is four kezeisim which are two beitzim) which are all swallowed at same time, and according to a minority shita the kezeisim should be divdied in half in the mouth and one should swallow half first and then the other half.
In summary, eat four kezeisim at the same time but swallow two kezeisim first and then the second two... and of course make sure you don&#039;t end up running into achilas gasa in which case you might not be yotzei and will have to do it again later when it&#039;s digested...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What Chazal say is that halacha le Moshe mi Sinai is that Achilah means a kzayit.  (The exception is Yom Kippur, because the Torah never uses the term achila, it says afflict yourself -- v&#039;inisem.  That is why the shiur is different.)  K&#039;Zayit is the universal shiur for both issurim (to be liable) and for mitzvos (e.g. matzah).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did you miss this paragraph?

&quot;The problem is that the Mishneh Berurah is not the only opinion worthy of consideration here. The Chazon Ish and Steipler Gaon ate their matzah in the normal manner.(Cited in Orchos Rabbeinu) They did not follow the suggestion of the author of the article and attempt to swallow giant balls of chewed up matzah. The Aruch Hashulchan (475:4-5) unequivocally permits eating matzah normally, as long as one does not make a hefsek. He bases this on the fact that the Shulchan Aruch invented this entire law without any Rishonim to support his ruling. Further, the Maharil (14th century Rishon) explicitly writes that one may eat the matzah slowly with no requirement to swallow the whole measure at once.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t see anywhere in this write-up you refute the possibility that halacha requires us to eat the matza in the way prescribed by rabbi Hoffmann.  should we not try and perform the mitzvah as intended by god?  we are orthodox jews, we follow the shulchan aruch, if this is appropriate then we do it!  do you disagree?  
all the fluffy stuff about getting lost in halachci minutae sounds great, but for reform jews, not orthodox ones!  you cant have your matza and eat it too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a kabbalistic-magic-angel thing. I think it&#039;s a symptom of the fact that many ancient Jewish sources instinctively feel wrong or unnatural to modern people. Modern Orthodox Jews have a variety of strategies for dealing with this, for example privileging certain opinions (like the Rambam&#039;s rationalism), or saying that society has changed and some social structures must change along with it. But charedim cannot accept these strategies on principle. So the problem of unnaturalness hits them with full force, and they are so shell-shocked by it that they reach the conclusion that ANYTHING natural must be against the Torah, that the Torah SHOULD feel unnatural and arbitrary, because what we feel is &quot;natural&quot; is a function of our animalistic yetzer hara rather than the higher wisdom of the Torah. Just as we have to reject our intuition when it comes to Amalek or ben sorer umoreh, so, they say, we cannot trust our intuition when it comes to choosing between one halachic opinion and another.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The author of the Shulchan Aruch, Rabbi Yosef Karo lived that kind of life. He was a mystic. But that is not how many others view halacha, nor is it the vision of halacha that I think works best in 2014.&quot;


While this may be true in general terms, compared to his colleagues in Tzfat (e.g. the Ari&quot;ZL, R&#039; Moshe Cordovero, etc.) Rav Yosef Karo was (at least in the area of Halakha) pretty straight.  Keep in mind that in R&#039; Yosef Karo&#039;s day, eating 2 normal sized kezeitim of soft matza in one shot was not that big of a challenge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the mysticism is a red herring because you miss the obvious point that the Mechaber would have had access to olives and would most likely have used an actual olive as reference. Once can certainly swallow wto olives at a time. As Rabbi Slifkin points out, the SA makes reference to &quot;some say a K&#039;Zayit is half an egg&quot; and a (the most) logical reading is that this is presented as a chumra with the Mechaber not even bothering to give his opinion because it is obvious that an olive is the size of an olive!

So if one holds by a (rationalist) olive-sized kezayit then one can fulfill the requirement to swallow in one gulp easily!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A comment I left on the 5TJT site:

I appreciate you taking the time to explain the halachik practice of many Jews to those who may not understand. However, I think it would do your readers a service to provide a balanced account of acceptable Jewish practices in this situation.

There are many halachik and hashkafic assumptions that go into trying to fulfill the mitzvah this manner, and an uninformed reader might not know how to distinguish between what is the ikar mitzvah and what is not. I know you are not obligated to do so, as you have the right to choose whatever agenda you want for an article, but I still think some balance would be nice.]]></description>
