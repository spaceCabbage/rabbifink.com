		<description><![CDATA[So, here is the thing. 

Assume that instead of 2014 we&#039;re 30 years back. It is 1984. Interracial Marriage has been legal in all of the United States since 1967.

The Civil Rights act is 20 years old.

Imagine a CEO is revealed to have donated to a group trying to get a Constitutional Amendment to ban interracial marriage in the United States. The CEO defends the position, and argues that there are plenty of people in the South who agree with him.

Would internal and external pressure forcing that CEO to resign have been justified? Would the CEO having been raised in the Jim Crow South have been justification for his role? Would the fact that a *majority* of the American public still opposed interracial marriage nearly 30 years after it was legalized have been grounds to justify bigotry?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What is sadly &quot;funny&quot; is the single comment that 75% of 18-29 year-olds support gay marriage is indicative of how lacking the morals of the 18-29 year-olds actually are . . . That is IF you believe that number to start with. I do not. It is simply another lie being sold by the liberal minority. I personally do not think the kids of today are really that stupid, ignorant to the truth obvious in nature or living in willful opposition to God. What it really may prove is how immature and undeveloped the thought processes of kids are. How many of us baby-boomers experienced a change in our reality as we got older? It will happen with these kids too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that the problem here is that Mozilla is not your average corporation. Mozilla Corp is owned by Mozilla Foundation, a non profit.   They own the Firefox and Thunderbird open source bases.  Quoting from the Mozilla Manifesto, &quot;The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create 
world-class open source software and to develop new types of 
collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in 
making the Internet experience better for all of us.&quot;   Thus, they can&#039;t afford to alienate the LGBT community or the millennial community, and many others.   LGBT equality is a hot button issue right now.  Mozilla needs squeaky clean hands. 

Kinda like Israel getting judged to a higher standard than other countries. 

It&#039;s unfortunate that Mr. Eich got caught up in this due to his personal convictions in 2008.  Unfortunately, when you take a public stand, by speaking out, or making political contributions, you build your reputation, and only new actions can change that. 

Consider that there are only two real names in this comment thread.  Rabbi Fink and myself.  The rest of you are anonymous, but Rabbi Fink, and I, may well have to suffer for our opinions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, everyone agrees with THAT.  Other than a few rarified Boston Brahamins types, everyone has always lived in a world where not everyone was exactly alike. It&#039;s very hard not to.  But that&#039;s not what celebrating &quot;diversity&quot; means in actual practice. In actual practice it means reverse racism, losing jobs to less qualified people so that women and blacks can be just as represented as whites, it means being afraid to voice your opinions on homosexuals, and a whole host of other things. Please don&#039;t tell me I&#039;m wrong; I work in a Fortune 200 company with exposure to all facets of the company, and I know exactly what I&#039;m speaking of. That&#039;s what &quot;diversity&quot; has come to mean. And buddy, you may think that&#039;s so valued, but again, that&#039;s only because you don&#039;t hear the other side. 
If you know how Title VII and the state equivalents work, it is, for all intents and purposes, ILLEGAL to state your opinion, because an opinion is construed as acceptable evidence as racism. So, for example, say you supervise a department of 10 individuals in supply chain. And you express your opinion that you think females are better suited as mothers than in the working world. And then, because of a corporate reorganization, you are forced to layoff an employee, and the employee is a woman. Your comment (regardless of when or in what context it was made) is now legally admissible evidence to prove that the reason for the termination was gender-based sexism.  So you think you can have any discourse in the world as to the differences between blacks and whites, males and females, Jews and Christians? Of course not. You are expected to accept anything and everything. That&#039;s your diversity for you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you think people naturally value diversity, or naturally value commonality?

		<description><![CDATA[Diversity is NOT as cherished as you naively believe it is. You only think diversity is so beloved because the millions who don&#039;t like it are afraid to say so, for EXACTLY the same reason this whole saga demonstrates. 

I would think the above point is beyond obvious, but in case you still don&#039;t get it, consider the orthodox Jewish experience. For many years it was assumed that the orthodox rabbinate spoke for the average individual, and that the charedi Gedolim were revered, etc etc. Then along came the Internet, where people were able to speak - more or less - with anonymity, and WHOA, all of a sudden we realized there&#039;s a lot more chinks in the armor than we once thought.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m 29, and when I was in college a secular Jewish friend of mine thought I was &quot;racist&quot; for not wanting to consider dating a non-Jew. That&#039;s the mindset of my generation. It&#039;s a kneejerk reaction toward pluralism and liberalism inculcated in us from elementary school. I say this as someone who grew up secular. It&#039;s the same thing with gay marriage. Only in the minds of the pampered and coddled and protected and hedonistic and apathetic Millennial generation has the issue of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; reached the proportions of being called a human rights issue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;It is not only unfair, but I think it might be immoral, to judge a 52 year old man with glasses of a person who lives in a different world.&lt;/i&gt;


This is almost exactly what was said about Norman Lamm et al and the Finkelstein/Gordon revelations.  Thirty years ago people didn&#039;t understand the gravity of sexual molestation, so it&#039;s wrong to judge Lamm by today&#039;s standards.  Agree or disagree?]]></description>
