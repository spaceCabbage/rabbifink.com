		<description><![CDATA[I disagree with your premise that only deaths or potential future deaths count. If Hamas kidnapped and tortured hundreds of Israelis, but kept them alive, would that not be worth going to war over? What if they were torturing children? What if they posted videos of the torture and taunted the parents online? 

What if they were torturing children without kidnapping them? Because an argument could be made that living under the constant threat of rocket fire, of having to always be aware of where the closest shelter is, of having kids playing in bomb shelters instead of outside, etc., is a form of torture. It certainly results in a lot of psychological and physical stress. Which, by the way, not only worsens the quality of life, it also shortens the lives of people, in the form of increased car accidents, heart attacks, strokes, suicides, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, after reading this article I am embarrassed for you. You clearly lack some of the basic universal and timeless Jewish values and ideals that have allowed our nation to survive this long amid centuries of antisemitism and conflict. As an Israeli, as a Jew, and as a staunch PJC supporter and affiliate for my entire life, I am glad that your absurd views do not represent those of the Israeli public or the majority of Israeli decision makers. Your views also do not represent those of the vast majority of your own congregation at PJC. Thank God for that!!!  Good luck with everything but perhaps in the future you will think for more than two seconds before you write. As rabbi, are you not supposed to be a role model and a representative of your community???!!!!

		<description><![CDATA[I must say I cried after reading last statement, E. Fink.  Your views have become so warped you no longer care for your fellow Jew as you once did. 
They are everyone.  We must protect them.  Besides, you are advocating allowing continued rocket fire that is terrible for everyone.
You say that everything must be added up in terms of deaths.  Thousands of rockets have been fired at Israel.  Whether it lands in an open field, is intercepted by the Iron Dome, or lands in a civilian area hundreds of thousands of lives are disrupted by running to shelters with the fear of death looming over their heads.  Is this a life?  Can one live this way?  I for one could not and doubt your ability to.  While it is sad that Palestinians have been killed, I must ask you how you would answer the following scenario, and please be objective so you can make the decision that is best for everyone.  An armed robber approaches a group of 5 people demanding their money, you as a bystander have a gun and can eliminate him, but will kill an unarmed friend of his who is just watching and has shown no evidence of being involved.  How would you respond?  You don&#039;t know if will kill all 5 or any, presumably he wants the money and nothing more.  Is the death of the friend worth it?  What if all he will do is cripple them?  They will live.  Should you allow that so that the friend doesn&#039;t become collateral damage?
If you cared for the life of your fellow Jew you would understand that although sad it is necessary.  With or without the tunnels, Hamas must be stopped and the only way to accomplish that is by killing them off.  It is all they understand and all they want.  No truce will last and no peace can be made with Hamas.  They seek only one thing, DEATH.  Death is what they shall receive.  Israel must do what must be done to save its nation.  Today its rockets tomorrow it is suicide bombers and the next day even worse. Misplaced mercy results in cruelty.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I respectfully submit that &quot;was it worth it&quot; is the wrong question. The right question is &quot;what other choice was there.&quot; Hamas was gradually increasing the rate of rocket fire, and it seems clear to me - and I think to most Israelis - that they were determined to continue the rate of fire until they provoked an Israeli response. Should there have been a different response? No response? Should Israel allow a situation in which the towns and settlements around Gaza are gradually rendered uninhabitable? Would a lack of any response, or an inadequate response, encourage Hizballah to undertake a similar war of attrition in the North? Would it boost Hamas&#039;s public standing vis-a-vis the Palestinian Authority, thereby rendering any long term peace agreement much less likely? All of these factors need to be taken into account in evaluating the war. Which is not over, as Alan Levin points out.

A more important question, though, is the following. In the past, when Israel has refused on security grounds to make concessions in the peace process that would lead to a Palestinian state, advocates of a two-state solution have argued that Israel can rely on its military strength to take risks for peace. However, we have seen in Gaza that world opinion, and perhaps our own collective concience, put significant limitations on Israel&#039;s ability to deal with attacks from Gaza. Imagine a scenario in which a Palestinian state is formed in the West Bank/Judea and Samaria, and comes under control of Hamas or some other group acting as Hamas has been acting in Gaza. In this scenario, it wouldn&#039;t be a handful of towns and settlements and several cities under nearly constant rocket threat - it would be most of the country. In this Gaza war, air traffic to Israel was significantly disrupted for several days due to a Hamas rocket that fell near the airport. If these attacks were coming from the West Bank, they would be able to shut down the airport completely, with ease. What implications does the reaction of the international community towards the operation in Gaza have for Israel&#039;s ability to use rely on its military strength to alleviate these &quot;risks for peace&quot; in such a scenario? I cite a recent blog post by Rabbi Slifkin on this point: http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2014/07/gaza-killed-palestine.html. The irony of all this is that Israel&#039;s ability, or lack thereof, to deter attacks from Gaza has a direct impact on the feasibility of the two-state solution.
In short, I believe it is quite insufficient to evaluate the war in terms of lives lost, or lives that might have been lost, here and now. There are much bigger, long-term issues that have to be considered. War is terrible, we shouldn&#039;t forget that, and we shouldn&#039;t be oblvious to the suffering on the Palestinian side. But I don&#039;t think this country (Israel) would exist if our leaders had only considered the short term costs/benefits in making their decisions on war and peace.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thousands of rockets are not so terrible? Thousands living in fear is not so terrible? 


The fact that more Israelis died in a month is irrelevant. One does not judge the morality or need of fighting based on how many people have died so far vs. how many will potentially die in battle.  You fight because someone is a threat to your nation and the people living in it. Normalcy, in this regards, is not the normalcy you are refer to on FB. The normalcy here is not wanting to die or living in fear of constant dying. I wish it was only a matter of your neighbor playing loud music. That would be easy. 


Your basic idea here is, had no tunnels existed, Israel ought to have treated the threat as nothing more than an annoying mosquito. Sure, they are annoying, and may bite, but in the end, no real harm was caused. It was just a mosquito.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;But the war was taking the lives of far too many soldiers and Palestinian civilians. Their blood is just as red as the rest of us.&quot;
That you can equate the lives of Jewish soldiers with Palestinian &quot;civilians&quot;, who voted in Hamas, is just unbelievable. And did you even have a hava minah that it wasn&#039;t worth it? We should just let Hamas murder our children with no response? We should just let our brothers in the South go on getting bombed, lest we hurt Palestinian &quot;civilians&quot; in responding?
