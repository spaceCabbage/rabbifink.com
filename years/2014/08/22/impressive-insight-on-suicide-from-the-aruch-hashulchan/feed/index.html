		<description><![CDATA[The suspicion of Suicide comes form the way the army is treating the death.

The 21-year-old former Detroiter was found dead Aug. 19 after having been reported missing from his base in Central Israel following a dental appointment on Aug. 17. He was found in uniform and with his IDF rifle. Authorities have not elaborated on the circumstances of his death.

Had he not committed suicide, the cause of death, or probable cause, would have likely been reported.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course, all the assumptions being made here by the poskim are within the context of a society where suicide is generally abhorred. In Classical Rome or medieval Japan, for example, it was not uncommon for mentally healthy people to take their own lives. Contemporary suicide bombers are also not victims of mental illness.

The fact that no halachic authority seems to consider such examples would suggest that Jewish societies never considered suicide acceptable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, just to make you aware of another very important &quot;source&quot; for this discussion, it also very impressive because it is an extremely halachic source as well.  The Pischei Teshuvah, one of the important commentators on the Shulchan Aruch, in Yoreh Deah Siman 345 says the only time suicide is considered &quot;meabeid atzmo l&#039;daas&quot; is if he does it on principle like an existentialist.  Similar to the oft-quoted statement from Nietzsche that &quot;G-d is dead&quot; and that life is futile.  But, says the Pischei Teshuvah, if someone kills themselves because of depression, anxiety, pain, or the like, that is not considered suicide.  That is considered halachically as &quot;meabeid atzmo shelo l&#039;daas&quot; and that is not considered willfully taking one&#039;s life, which is what suicide is.  That is considered as killing one&#039;s self because of pain or suffering, which is (terribly unfortunate, but) understandable and called without &quot;daas.&quot;  This is unfortunately discussed as well in the Teshuvos Mimaamakim, the questions that came out of the depths of the Holocaust to the great Rav Ephraim Oshri, the Rav of the Warsaw ghetto.  Dave Gordon should be remembered for a blessing.  Amen. And please see Rabbi Eisenmann&#039;s (from Passaic) post on that topic as well, unbelievable. .]]></description>
