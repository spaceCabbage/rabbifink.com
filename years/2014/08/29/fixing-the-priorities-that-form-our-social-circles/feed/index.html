		<description><![CDATA[Having read the comments, I am still not convinced that a significant portion of the Orthodox community is interested in questioning the beliefs of observant Jews unless the latter make a point of publicly identifying themselves as Orthoprax.

Yes.

 &lt;i&gt;If they agree to leave belief as a non-issue and focus on practice, the Orthodox community is content to allow it, no?&lt;/i&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure I understand your point. Everyone knows that there are many Orthoprax Jews without Orthodox beliefs, right? Is anyone tripping over themselves to root out the heretics and kick them out of shul? My understanding is that the issue is only when those with contradictory beliefs insist on engaging with others about their beliefs. If they agree to leave belief as a non-issue and focus on practice, the Orthodox community is content to allow it, no?]]></description>

You have attached your post to Farbers, and Farber has a very specific outline about the orthodox community and it isn&#039;t about &quot;let&#039;s all be friends and not worry about beliefs.&quot; I mean, if that was your point than fine, but why piggy back off Farber?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; It is connected by common values and attitudes and behaviors.


True. But in a religious community, the values, attitudes, and behaviors are partly or wholly influenced by the beliefs. Especially in the frum community. Would you eat in the home of a family that keeps kosher, but doesn&#039;t believe its a divine requirement? After all, you can&#039;t be sure that someone didn&#039;t accidentally  put a milchig fork into a hot steak and then decided it was too much trouble to kasher it. If its just something they do because they think its a nice tradition, they may not bother with the little inconveniences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course it affects others. Im not arguing over that. But why should something called an &quot;orthodox&quot; community worry about it? It&#039;s not &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; concern, since in the end, what inevitably happens, there really isn&#039;t a community. You live in Venice do you not? Would you call it a community? I&#039;m sure you do. But how much of the community bond exists due to something called the &quot;Venice Belief&quot; system vs. simple geography? An orthodox community is formed first by it&#039;s shared belief. Chuck that out, and there is no &quot;community&quot; to even claim any sort of voice to be concerned about anything. Just have your local neighborhood block party once a year and you are set.

&#062;I AM NOT TABS OR R&#039; FARBER. I am just a guy saying Kumbaya.



Didn&#039;t say you are, but I am showing you why the community does and ought to worry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I actually think Rabbi Fink&#039;s problem is not an overly-rosy view about those on the right, but an overly-rosy &quot;cumbaya&quot; mentality in general. In my opinion the idea that beliefs are not important (whether religion, boy scouts, politics etc. etc.) is ridiculous. Not even humanists keep their belief to &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt;. It&#039;s those beliefs that keep the group together in order to achieve certain actions and behaviors. It simply shows me a disregard for (in this case) the religion in general. If all that is important is behavior and not the Jewish belief, dump it all and join your local humanist chapter. You&#039;ll miss the shabbat morning herring, but, you know, there are always certain sacrifices.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure, I get it. There&#039;s a reason that concepts like heresy exist. They&#039;re defense mechanisms for the religion.


I think R&#039; Fink often has an overly-rosy view of his right-leaning coreligionists. I love the idea of all of us just getting along, but in the real world, it doesn&#039;t work, because they&#039;re right about things like scientific knowledge and the internet being a danger to (their brand of) Judaism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If one wants to be intellectually honest, than fundamentalists are right. Beliefs, not just actions are what keep a group together. Farber suggests stripping the entire edifice away. Notice that TABS, for all their essays have not be able to write a single essay under the GOD category. There is a reason for this a presume. If you strip off everything, nobody can make a single case for worshipping a god called YHWH. I know you don&#039;t believe in these things G3, but don&#039;t you at least the logic from where the fundamentals are coming from?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;All we need to do is not worry about the beliefs of another. Don’t wonder. Don’t ask. Don’t care. It’s doesn’t matter enough to you to justify caring.



Wait a minute. But &lt;em&gt;Farber&lt;/em&gt; cares. He is saying that our beliefs need to change. His post, and for that matter the entire point of TABS is not about behavior. It&#039;s about restructuring the belief of Judaism away from anything one claims to be Judaism and towards a pro-JEPD. Also the suggestion that beliefs are only important to the individual is only true if you don&#039;t care too much to preserve a religion. A religion is not JUST about actions. It&#039;s the network between the beliefs and actions working together. Why not simply be a secular humanist and you can have all your ethics and values? No need to worry about beliefs there. Oh wait…they care too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It seems to me that deeds and character should matter more than personal thoughts and opinions that are of no practical consequence. No one is harmed by erroneous or heretical beliefs.&quot; - Eliyahu Fink

&quot;When all these principles of faith are in the safe keeping of man, and his conviction of them is well established, he then enters בכלל ישראל “into the general body of Israel,” and it is incumbent upon us to love him, to care for him, and to do for him all that God commanded us to do for one another in the way of affection and brotherly sympathy. And this, even though he were to be guilty of every transgression possible, by reason of the power of desire or the mastery of the base natural passions. He will receive punishment according to the measure of his perversity, but he will have a portion in the world to come, even though he be of the פושעי ישראל “transgressors in Israel.”

&quot;When, however, a man breaks away from any one of these fundamental principles of belief, then of him is it said that יצא מן הכלל “he has gone out of the general body of Israel,” and כפר בעקר “he denies the root-truths of Judaism.” And he is then termed מין, and אפיקורס ,and קוצץ בנטיעות “hewer of the small plants,” and it is obligatory upon us to hate him and cause him to perish, and it is concerning him that the scriptural verse says (Psalms 139:21):—הלא משנאיך ה’ אשנא “Shall I not hate those who hate thee, O Lord?” - Maimonides]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I almost think you&#039;re giving people too much credit by saying that their communities are based purely on belief. The dividing lines between the various Jewish communities are not just belief but garb, halachic practice, and even the choice of where someone lives, where he goes to shul or where he sends his children to school.  Regardless we should place more emphasis on people&#039;s characters and middot but breaking this down to a case of belief versus actions seems a bit oversimplified. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; A solution that will divide us further is not an option for me.

You say this as if official community positions determine (and should determine) beliefs. To some extant that’s true, in that most people don’t care enough to form rigorous theologies of their own and just adopt that of their community. But the world is as it is. Biblical criticism makes the traditional understanding of Tanach untenable. If some communities want to pretend that’s not true, that’s their right, but those of us not living in a fantasy shouldn’t feel obligated to pretend their position has merit simply so that they will continue to include us in those they consider part of their in-group.

&#062; No one is harmed by erroneous or heretical beliefs. Yet, the non-believer is shunned as if his beliefs were contagious and deadly. 

That’s where fundamentalist groups disagree with you. Heretical beliefs are harmful, they are contagious, and chas v’shalom someone might be influenced by kefirah and led off the derech into a vapid life of hedonistic debauchery.]]></description>
