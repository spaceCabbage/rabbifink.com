		<description><![CDATA[What exactly is the point of this post? Are you insinuating now that you&#039;re also smarter than the Prime Minister of Israel? 
And even if, purely for the sake of argument only, there are differences between ISIS and Hamas - so what? Does that give one license to speak of Hamas in the tones that you do? You make it sound as though they&#039;re nothing more than Arab patriots fighting for their home land. Only someone so young, thousands of miles away in La-La-land could write such a thing.  
And mixing in the business of Hamas being a &quot;men&#039;s club&quot; - that made me a smile. Only a real liberal could find a way to inject his democrat politics into Israeli-Arab affairs. Tell me, were the Founding Fathers of America a &quot;men&#039;s club&quot;? Is OPEC a men&#039;s club? How about the Moetzes Gedole Hatorah of the Aguda or the RCA? &quot;Men&#039;s club&quot; is another way of saying &quot;life.&quot; The only places where that&#039;s not the norm is the current generation, in America and others places that have followed them in enacting forced feminization legislation. Even in the business world, read Forbes magazine and find me more than a handful of women among the richest people in America that didn&#039;t inherit or marry their money. (And that&#039;s with all the laws unabashedly stacked in their favor!) Go back and read your Genesis, and play the long game. Within two generations even here things will be back to normal. Don&#039;t be on the wrong side of history.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,
Every blogger picks the topics he/she decides to devote time to writing about, selecting from a virtually inexhaustible supply of current (and non-current) political and cultural events, statements by politicians, religious leaders, athletes etc.
It&#039;s probably true that the actions of Hamas (who&#039;s capabilities are very limited, compared to ISIS) have not been quite as barbaric and bloodthirsty as those of ISIS. It is also factually correct that geographically, Hamas are fighting from their home. However, when a blogger who posts, on average, a few times a week, feels the need to take the time to call out the Israeli PM on this matter, then this is pretty telling. 
I enjoy your posts and agree with most of them. This one, while for the most part factually correct, is a misfire.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hamas may not be ISIS, but they haven&#039;t joined the Boy Scouts yet and never will.  The difference I see is that Hamas is led by bought and paid for fat cats, while ISIS are purist who are much less likely to be compromised or controlled.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink:
I find this post most disturbing, even more so than your others. Take a look at the photos of Hamas sumamrily executing the &quot;collaborators&quot;. The havoc (to put it mildly) that Hamas dealt to thier own citiiznry was awful- and they couldn&#039;t care less. And more will come out about this in the weeks to come. I sense an ounce of jsutification from your writing for the bombing campaign that Hamas perpetrated over the last 9 years. Shame on you for putting this into print.  Further, the people of Hamas are all from Gaza. They are fighting a war against their enemy on their border. In their eyes, Israel stole their land. In their eyes, they are fighting back. It’s a struggle on behalf of their families and neighbors. It’s their struggle for their own home and their own future. They are local people from Gaza fighting for Gaza. There are women, children, and families that are connected to Hamas militants.]]></description>
