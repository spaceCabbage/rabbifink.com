		<description><![CDATA[Why is going to a posting/position (shtelle) where people are not necessarily shomer Shabbos beneath you station?  If the rabbinate is your &quot;calling&quot; the HK&quot;H will send you where you are needed.  
It is typical of some (too many) frum people not to appreciate Jews who are less observant.  A little (maybe a healthy dose) ahavas yisroel would be better.  
I suggest you get yourself involved with something like &quot;Partners in Torah&quot; or some other kiruv work and realize what is out there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was not at the meeting but commend those who were there.  When we are willing to sit with others we can connect and be empathic.  I&#039;m found in my experiences that those who have felt the need to leave the community often are the most knowledgeable about the areas that need to be worked on, and when conversation occurs there can be understanding.  

There are so many issues that warrant discussion really almost any issue that is being dealt with elsewhere.  I can imagine that some might include:
The method and focus of the education system and the fact that so many struggle
The financial struggles of living a
frum lifestyle and how those challenges trickle down to children
The way religion can be used as an excuse for all sorts of negative behaviors
Bullying
SSA and a place for such people within the Jewish community
Etc]]></description>
