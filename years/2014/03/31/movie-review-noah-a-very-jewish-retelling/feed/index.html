		<description><![CDATA[Well said, @Osbrew. I too am a Christian who does not fit into the &quot;monolithic&quot; mode, but the spiritual mode. I belong to no denomination, because such a concept only divides us and, because God is love, we should come together -- not under any one denomination, but under the Heavenly Father himself.


I love this movie because it is such a wonderful conversation starter. Even though I haven&#039;t seen it, I still hunger to see it. Here in the Philippines the opening date was supposed to be April 2, but it has been delayed indefinitely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Genesis seems to imply that God was satisfied with the performance of the Flood, because He promised never again to use the Flood. But did the Flood cure humanity of that corruption of flesh, wickedness and violence? Perhaps only a type of these was cured which displeased the Heavenly Father.

So, from what was humanity cured? We may have the answer. Finally!

		<description><![CDATA[Wonderful! Thanks for these wonderful insights into the movie. Yes! A conversation starter and that&#039;s a good thing, because we&#039;re talking about God and His work.

Perhaps it was a bit ironic that my book on the same topic was finally published about the time the movie came out. I guess this is the season for discussing Noah.

What I found in my own research is that Noah&#039;s Flood was an act of love -- only this and nothing more. Understanding this idea still gives me goosebumps. Oi gevalt! Whooohh!

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the review. I appreciate seeing one from a Jewish perspective, rather than all the Christian perspectives that have been dominating the media. As a Catholic though, I disagree with a few assertations you made in the beginning regarding Christians having monolithic views of the Old Testament and biblical literalism being the marker of devotion. While there are definitely many who take a very literal interpretation of the Bible (and they are often the most outspoken), there are also many who attempt to understand the cultural, historical, and literary contexts of the various books and stories, understanding that there are many writing styles present. This is especially strong in the Catholic tradition. Other than that, I found your review very interesting and informative. Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But the movie has nothing to do with PETA or the EPA. Its environmentalist message is like a paraphrase from Mesilas Yesharim who quotes Koheles Raba: &quot;בשעה שברא הקדוש ברוך הוא את אדם הראשון, נטלו והחזירו על כל אילני גן עדן ואמר לו, ראה מעשי כמה נאים ומשובחים הן, וכל מה שבראתי בשבילך בראתי, תן דעתך שלא תקלקל ותחריב את עולמי&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oy vey. Lol. Forget what I said above, about maybe going to see it. I just clicked on the link AY Lawrence referenced above. This is a Darren Arnovsky movie. My wife and I just watched PI this past motzei Shabbos, because it was streaming on Netflix and rotten tomatoes gave it good scores. And we thought it was awful. The most pretentious art-house bit of trash we&#039;d been subjected to in a while. So no thanks to another of his offerings.

Also, note that said Arnovsky is quoted in said link saying: &quot;There is a huge statement in the film, a strong message about the coming flood from global warming.”
So much for it not being an environmental screed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, perhaps I eventually will see it, because of Crowe. But a movie can be preachy without being overtly so. Look at the 3d movie, what was it called....Avatar. Everyone knows its an environmental movie, even though at no point does anyone actually quite wag a finger and lecture.
As for the midrashim, I acknowledge the ones you mention (though not Rav Kook&#039;s idea of sacrificing a potato) can be called mainstream. However -  - there is a big jump from there, towards calling environmentalism itself, mainstream. This is part of a larger problem I&#039;ve addressed in different places. The Torah unquestionably has a liberal point of view in many things, as I said above. But jumping from that to today&#039;s version of liberalism is an unsupported leap. It would be like saying that because the Torah prohibits cruelty to animals, that we call the Torah a PETA supporter. Or taking Devarim 16:20 as a support of affirmative action/reverse racism. So while it is true that the midrashim themselves can fairly be called mainstream, the Torah cannot fairly be said to support &quot;environmentalism&quot; as we know it today through the EPA and state equivalents.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Midrashic traditions I mentioned in this article are all mainstream Midrashim. Heck, most of them are found in Rashi.


It seems like not only didn&#039;t you see the movie, you didn&#039;t read the article you&#039;re commenting on. It&#039;s also kind of silly to call something you haven&#039;t seen an environmental screed. You probably should see it, especially if you like Russell Crowe. He was excellent. It&#039;s not preachy and some parts of the movie were quite beautiful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your review is fairly typical of what I would expect from a left-winger &quot;asked by Haaretz&quot; to write a review. Claiming that environmentalism is part of our tradition, and so forth. The usual stuff.
To say that the existence of a midrash makes something part of our tradition is a misrepresentation. I&#039;m sure you have Ginzberg&#039;s Legends on your shelf - there are midrashim to support just about any viewpoint you can think of. I saw some blog brining down the midrash about Cham, and proclaimed the Noach story to be all about homosexuals. Another brought down the exact opposite midrash, and declared the story to be about sexual abuse. Still other speaks of the curse of Ham, and thus says the lesson of the Torah here is racism. Someone else noticed the drinking wine aspect, and discovered that the parsha stood for the lesson of alcohol abuse. Now you&#039;re telling us its all about environmentalism. Any other current liberal fad someone wants to shtip into the parsha? Nothing here about transgenderism - how bout we shoehorn that into the creation story, bc the midrash says Adam was born a hermaphrodite.
The problem with all the above nonsense, and it is nonsense, is that the Torah IS unabashedly liberal, and you don&#039;t have to go hunting around for midrashim to prove it. If I was a piece of Gemara I would say the whole Torah can be reduced to one principle, of helping the poor. Once upon a time, that WAS liberalism. Somewhere around the 1960s this country made a wrong turn and began defining liberalism  - to a generation of kids bereft of religion in school and hence ready to believe in anything-  in a new way. Sad for the country.
Anyway, I&#039;ve not seen the movie, and as much as I like Russel Crowe, probably wont. I don&#039;t need to see a movie to get preached to, I can get that at shul, or hell, on this very blog. Very stupid move on the producers&#039;s part, in my opinion. They should have learned from Mel Gibson that there are millions of Americans ready to spend money of films with a religious message. But by making this an environmental screed, they botched it up. Hollywood, in the usual liberal religion-phobe way, thinks &quot;the other&quot; are a bunch of rubes who can be sold on a film just by calling it a biblical name. Guess they think those weird jesus freaks don&#039;t know how to use the internet.]]></description>

Another brought down the exact opposite midrash, and declared the story to be about sexual abuse. Still other speaks of the curse of Ham, and thus says the lesson of the Torah here is racism. Someone else noticed the drinking wine aspect, and discovered that the parsha stood for the lesson of alcohol abuse. Now you&#8217;re telling us its all about environmentalism. Any other current liberal fad someone wants to shtip into the parsha? Nothing here about transgenderism &#8211; how bout we shoehorn that into the creation story, bc the midrash says Adam was born a hermaphrodite.<br />
The problem with all the above nonsense, and it is nonsense, is that the Torah IS unabashedly liberal, and you don&#8217;t have to go hunting around for midrashim to prove it. If I was a piece of Gemara I would say the whole Torah can be reduced to one principle, of helping the poor. Once upon a time, that WAS liberalism. Somewhere around the 1960s this country made a wrong turn and began defining liberalism  &#8211; to a generation of kids bereft of religion in school and hence ready to believe in anything-  in a new way. Sad for the country.<br />
Anyway, I&#8217;ve not seen the movie, and as much as I like Russel Crowe, probably wont. I don&#8217;t need to see a movie to get preached to, I can get that at shul, or hell, on this very blog. Very stupid move on the producers&#8217;s part, in my opinion. They should have learned from Mel Gibson that there are millions of Americans ready to spend money of films with a religious message. But by making this an environmental screed, they botched it up. Hollywood, in the usual liberal religion-phobe way, thinks &#8220;the other&#8221; are a bunch of rubes who can be sold on a film just by calling it a biblical name. Guess they think those weird jesus freaks don&#8217;t know how to use the internet.</p>
