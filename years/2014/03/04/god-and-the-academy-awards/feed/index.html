		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s go back and read what you wrote:

&quot;Movies rarely show a good side of religious belief. Scripture is often used by villains to justify their behavior. I can’t recall a single contemporary on-screen hero that was religious in any way. Movies are not always anti-religion, but they are very rarely pro-God.&quot;



Let&#039;s say, that movies were in general always showing Israel in a bad light, or, rarely pro-Israel. All of a sudden someone got up and said something nice about Israel. Would we not applaud that? It wouldn&#039;t be about reinforcement. Our opinions on Israel would not change.  It&#039;s about finally hearing another side to the story from an industry that would tend to be one sided.]]></description>
