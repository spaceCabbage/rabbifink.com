		<description><![CDATA[Great article even thought my favorite example didn&#039;t make the cut.  The mid 1700&#039;s unleashed an enormous wave of of rebellious and romantic energy culminating in the American Revolution and the music of Beethoven, to site two desperate examples.  The period also gave rise to the Chasidic movement which at its inception was also characterized by an uncontainable spirit of social reform and religious upheaval.  One could say of Chassidus what Shelley claimed about the literature of England, &#039;that it had arisen as at it were from a new birth.&#039; Both were an expression of eighteenth century Romanticism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope the current set of Orthodox movments have run their course. We have had enough of a distortion of Torah that so focuses on frumkeit (how can I be holy) that it neglects avodas Hashem (how can G-d&#039;s Work be done) and ehrlachkeit (simply being good to people and loyal to G-d; not sure if that&#039;s different than avodas Hashem as I just defined it).

In the sense that the Orthodox Jews have drifted from G-d&#039;s message, Orthodoxy has failed. But in the sense that Orthodoxy means fealty to at least a particular subset of G-d&#039;s message, there will always be an Orthodoxy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tuvia - 
I agree with you. Feminism has won. Sadly, the politicians have been weak, and they (the fems) have achieved their goals, at the expense of society. And now, as everyone realizes, America is in decline. BUT - I&#039;ll be damned if I&#039;m going to let that happen to my religion. Not on my watch, it wont. Note that I emphasize religion, and not orthodoxy. Orthodoxy&#039;s not going anywhere - any shul where feminist goals become reality will simply be re-written out of orthodoxy. So as I say, I&#039;m not really worried about me personally, because orthodoxy isn&#039;t going to change. I just don&#039;t want them screwing around with my religion. 
As for orthodoxy being a failed ideology - that&#039;s true too, in some respects. Certainly if it purports to represent the words of the Prophets, its a colossal failure. And also if anyone ever thought orthodoxy was something for all Jews to emulate, that too, was a flop. And of course, its riddled with internal inconsistencies and logical gaps. Still and all, as a minority report within the minority, its had a remarkable run of success.  When you read SHU&#039;T literature from the medieval period, and apprehend that the same issues animating men from those times are still the same issues we deal with today - well, that&#039;s pretty darn good. Orthodoxy has preserved the main nuggests of its identity for a loooooooong time, and shows no sign of abatement. It&#039;s provided numberless people with meaning in their lives. So, no doubt its a mixed scorecard, but to claim simply that orthodoxy is a failed ideology - that&#039;s wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; Twersky is speaking about a particular kind of change. After all, he opens up with three problems about how the change is being done. I would summarize the first as formal / texual authority (500 years of rabbinic consensus that won over Sepharadi thought as well, and the second is about the power of mimetic tradition.

WRT the third, he writes (in part):

&lt;i&gt;In modern times women did not begin donning tefillin to emulate Michal bas Shaul, be devout Maimonideans or invoke shem Hashem upon themselves. Women donned tefillin because men do so. Within the secular modern mindset adopted by Reform and Conservative wherein equality = uniformity women who don tefillin thereby attain a measure of equality with men.4 And thus the defining issue is axiological: can the secular value of egalitarianism be grafted ontoHalachah?

The answer is obvious. Egalitarianism rejects a vital, essential, divinely ordained dimension of Halachah. Halachah does not discriminate against men or women. Most assuredly, however, it distinguishes between the genders. A genuine commitment to authentic Halachah per force entails rejecting the socially dominant, false philosophy of egalitarianism.&lt;/i&gt;

RMT seems to be saying that the very same change, but had it been for the sake of imitating Michal, being convinced by the Rambam, or the like, it would have been okay with him. (Yes, I intentionally omitted the contentious one. I think he&#039;s accusing C &#038; R women of not being interested in invoking G-d&#039;s name on themselves, as he gave the girls in question the benefit of the doubt higher up. Whether he really believes that or was being polite, R&#039; Twersky apparently feels he could concede the point and still make his argument.)

There are other indicators as well that it&#039;s the kind of change and the lack of expertise of those implementing it -- and the lack of acknowledgment that there is expertise involved you can&#039;t get from combining semichah with the the Bar Ilan CD -- that is bothering RMT. Not change in general.

I thought he really does say &quot;you have evolved Torah lifestyle that has been influenced by our surroundings on one side and egalitarian ideals that sometimes conflict with Torah on the other side&quot;. R&#039; Twersky makes a point of revisiting the discussion of positive change to accommodate society vs. change to accepts its values once again after the opening three points, and then drawing the distinction between two sorts of change in motive (e.g. Beis Yaacov in sec. V) and person (sec. VI).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes we agree that change occurs. The one who conflated change in general into the conversation with R&#039; Fink -- not R&#039; Schachter nor R&#039; Twersky. Disproving a claim that we&#039;ve never changed halakhah is winning a fight against a strawman.

They&#039;re saying that decided whether the change advances the Torah&#039;s goals or dilutes its message requires a skill / art that a local synagogue rabbi or school principal probably lacks.


--


And yes, there is a huge leadership problem. Many of the people we would lean on for having this kind of skill are so much products of the yeshiva ivory tower that they don&#039;t really have a sense of the reality they&#039;re being asked to apply the Torah to. Even those who ask professionals (and I would simply advise ignoring those who don&#039;t) don&#039;t always know what questions need asking. But that doesn&#039;t give us license to make these decisions ourselves. It requires identifying the gedolim who do relate to the world in question and referring one&#039;s questions to them. Modern Orthodoxy and Religious Zionism does not put their gedolim on the same pedestal as chareidi ideology does, and therefore one doesn&#039;t hear of them as often. But they do exist. If you distrust R&#039; Herschel Schachter&#039;s opinion on the subject, ask R&#039; Aharon Lichtenstein, R&#039; Willig, R&#039; Shapira or R&#039; Ariel.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1: &quot;These examples show that pesaq can change as social realities change the facts on the ground.&quot; 
2: &quot;...  applying Torah values with the greatest fidelity possible ... when conforming to external values ...requires experiential immersion in ... halakhah ...&quot;


So we agree that change occurs, and that pesaq must deal with changes in norms in an adequate way. I think you missed a step in here: the ability to truly understand and evaluate the human side, as well as the cost/benefit, of the pesaw/halakha changes required. From where I sit, I think this is where many Rabbis fall rather short. They tend to live in a cloistered and closed environment that mirrors the world they want, and so they cannot truly encompass people who differ from them, There seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to all changes that they are bad and antithetical to Torah. I am pretty sure that the chumra d&#039;reabbeinu  gershon was considered quite radical for his time, and was not met with resounding applause from all corners. Do we have leaders willing to go out on that limb anymore? Based on the numerous conversations I have had with various rabbis over the years, I see a total fear of being mattir something even when they feel it is allowed! Why? Generally speaking, they have all said the same thing: that they are afraid that if they are mattir something they will be perceived as &quot;not frum enough&quot; and will jeopardize their status in the &quot;frum olam&quot; The number of times I have personally heard this (not from a friend-of-a-friend-who-heard-that-so-and-so-said ...) is astonishing. So I think part of the problem with halachik pesaq is that we have a leadership who is, to put it bluntly, quite weak. The role that askanim and others play is a topic worthy of a separate post/discussion, but the radicalization of the street, and the sway the radicals hold, is not helpful. 
(I am not expressing my sentiment as clearly or as thoroughly as I would like, but I think you get the idea.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Pruzbul&quot; (the document handing over loans for beis din to collect so that they out-survive a rabbinic shemittah)? I bet you meant heter isqa (the loan-like halachic structure in which the lender absorbs negligable risk in a &quot;business&quot; so that the laws of interest don&#039;t apply).

These examples show that pesaq can change as social realities change the facts on the ground. Not that pesaq changes to &lt;b&gt;conform&lt;/b&gt; to them. Similarly, the launching of the Beis Yaakov movement wasn&#039;t to accommodate a desire to study because the zietgeist pushed toward women studying. The girls themselves were content to assimilate. Rather, the new social reality of universal secular education for girls meant that the old ruling didn&#039;t fit the new reality. The idea of teaching girls enough so that they can grow up into observant women shifted from only including a few basics and practical day-to-day halakhah to including enough to keep them engaged and wanting to stay observant.

The second difference is that you&#039;ll note that all these inventions either came from the minds of the leading posqim of the generation or (as in the case of Beis Yaacov) validated by them. Which was R&#039; Twersky&#039;s and R&#039; Schachter&#039;s primary thesis: Knowing when you&#039;re applying Torah values with the greatest fidelity possible to a new situation, and when one is conforming to external values at the expense of the Torah&#039;s requires more knowledge and more experiential immersion in the flow of halakhah (shimush) than a typical local rabbi achieves.]]></description>

Which was R&#8217; Twersky&#8217;s and R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s primary thesis: Knowing when you&#8217;re applying Torah values with the greatest fidelity possible to a new situation, and when one is conforming to external values at the expense of the Torah&#8217;s requires more knowledge and more experiential immersion in the flow of halakhah (shimush) than a typical local rabbi achieves.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The feminists won.  Women can chose tradition or something different.  That’s a victory.  Tradition does not suit everyone, that’s really all your average, modern feminist says.  The militant feminists may have come and gone – but much of their work was done: equal pay, anti-sex harassment laws, anti-discrimination laws.

Do you really think NO progress has been made for women as women in the last fifty years?

Orthodoxy is a failed ideology too.  As long as no one within the haredi community is permitted education, free thought, open inquiry, questions, real debates with outside voices – orthodoxy “wins.”  If people can’t exercise their G-d given rational faculty and must have counter-arguments suppressed, omitted, or mostly distorted – orthodoxy wins.  Well done!

If if real dialogue, debate, and a open inquiry and education (as opposed to just indoctrination) are permitted – the world wins.  No matter if people choose to be orthodox or not.  At that point, it’s a real choice, not a foregone conclusion.

You sound very confident – but it is the confidence of a Fidel Castro who points to his country as a stunning success, while the citizens are really just prisoners, no more choosing communism than I choose to be an earthling…]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Also, doesn’t orthodox Judaism kind of resemble communism in the former USSR?  

In FSU, “communism was obviously superior and the truth, and the west was decadent  and weak and classist.”

Only no one could travel abroad to see for themselves.  You couldn’t see material or info from the outside world or hear outside voices.  Anyone who disagreed better keep it to themselves  or maybe wind up in a forced labor camp.

Doesn’t that sound like orthodoxy sort of?  Where debate, open inquiry, broad education and access to information, evaluating haredi claims – all not tenable?  Where the walls are high and the threats of losing your place in the world to come keeps a freethinker from thinking or reading too freely?

And there is still a small communist party in the United States.  And northern Europe seems to embrace elements of a socialist ethos with some success.  And there are still a few kibbutzim for those who want to live the cooperative life.  And again, Marxism and the history and theories of communism are still widely learned and discussed in college.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Feminism is a winner, not a loser.  Communism is a bit of a loser – but many young people at least still enjoy learning about it.  Feminism is real – not the militant version, but women’s rights are real.  Gay rights are real too.  Diversity, etc.

I don’t know about racism – but in NYC you can find boatloads of white men dating and marrying Asian women, and some vice versa.  In parts of Brooklyn (like Fort Greene) and the East Village you will find substantial numbers of black men dating and marrying white women and some vice versa too.

None of this really speaks to orthodox Judaism.  I’m sure it will still be here.  I do wish I could be around when the year 6000 comes.  If there is no moshiach/resurrection of the righteous dead from all generations – it will probably hurt Judaism for a while til it regroups with new ikkurim.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My comment was aimed at the notion that Torah (and the lifestyle associated with it) doesn&#039;t change. Not whether a rabbi should approve of it, but whether it happens. Which it obviously does.

		<description><![CDATA[- and so they retroactively read their own practice into something that is clearly saying something else.

I think you mean they retroactively made up *justification* for practices that were already in play for a long time.

 - because it had come to be seen as immoral.



That may be speculation. Good speculation, but speculation nonetheless. What are some of the reasons they interject for not taking eye for an eye and rebellious son literally? Do they ever say something like &quot;Clearly this is immoral, therefore the Torah would never have DREAMT to be read literally?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But is the question about change, or changing in order to conform to external values? This discussion is mixing in halachic change in general, changies in philosophical framework, both of which may have different rules than the kind of change we&#039;re discussing.

The Rambam is a good example -- enough rishonim and acharonim said he went too far, fitting the Torah to that Aristotilian mold rather than using it as a lens to look at Torah. That whole controversy was predicated on there being an a limit to change other than the limits of valid interpretations of halakhah, and asking whether the Rambam crossed that line.

I understand R JB Soloveitchik&#039;s response to R&#039; Rackman&#039;s beis din in different terms. The majority of the shiur was about what R&#039; Schachter has called &quot;mesorah&quot; and &quot;daas Torah&quot;, knowing the flow and trend of halakhah. That it makes no sense to say that a proposal that does away with the need for about half of Mes&#039; Yevamos could be valid. Or that all the great minds of the comparatively modern era, such as the Shaagas Aryeh or his grandfather R&#039; Chaim, missed a simple solution to a weighty problem if that solution were valid.

His comment on tav lemeisav was two sentences. It was a formal legal justification of what RYBS felt &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to be the right answer for preservation-of-continuity reasons. We can argue whether we understand the validity of that argument or not, but that&#039;s step two, and none of the rest of this discussion went to step two. Steop one is whether we should be seeking this kind of change, or whether it&#039;s a reduction of Judaism to legal process without spirituality or values, a handmaiden to the zeitgeist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Look, E. Fink - you&#039;re trying to occupy both sides of the table. You disagree with Twersky&#039;s framing of the issue, because Torah has always been reconciled with culture. But when you see where that inevitably leads, you immediately walk it back and shy away from actually advocating the natural conclusion.
That&#039;s why I don&#039;t take either your view of Twersky&#039;s view. I don&#039;t take his, because you are correct, as anyone with an ounce of learning knows, there are scores of examples of how Torah is affected by society. [Yours is a nice sampling.] But I don&#039;t take yours either, because its thoroughly dishonest, and sooner or later you will have to fish [change your tune] or cut bait [become reform.] So the position I take here is: sure, we can do anything we want and justify it halachically but we&#039;re not going to do it here because its A FAILED IDEOLOGY. Feminism, like communism, is just another of the various and many failed 20th century ideologies. It will most assuredly not exist a hundred years hence, because it is contrary to the human nature and the human anatomy. [Same thing with its twin sister, racism, which literally asks  people to ignore elephants in the room by the millions, which they only acknowledge in whispers behind closed doors, but that&#039;s a different topic.] Orthodoxy, which despite its many flaws, is very conscious of history and the long view, and is not going to abandon the principles &quot;what got us here&quot; for the sake of a fleeting fad. Moreover, the concentration of feminism is focused upon single women, of which - because of feminism - there are more of today than ever before. Orthodoxy, which is entirely family-driven, is not going to sacrifice itself for an ideology antithetical to its values. Some rabbis and public figures may not have the courage to say these points publicly, and will go all wobbly. But not the majority, and certainly not the rank and file.
You may not agree with this view. But, I think, it is the only intellectual honest approach to it. The alternatives are ignorance on the one hand, hypocrisy on the other.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[- There’s a clear example of a halacha that was reinterpreted and twisted beyond all recognition because lex talonis didn’t fit the moral framework of the taanaim.



G3, I am curious as to how something like this changes. We know most change happen from bottom up. Do we have any frame of reference in the past few centuries of clear practice being subverted by those on the top? I don&#039;t know. It&#039;s a question. My proposal is simply that the Tanaaim, as well as most of what chazal wrote were retroactive justification for why they received a different halacha vs what the text says. A change of lex talonis is not something changed by chazal themselves, but probably something that was already changed well before they even started their work. Book of Nechemia says Ezra had teachers with him explaining the text. Who knows, the change might have already happened back then because that is simply what they were already practicing. Stick the issue of the rebellious son there as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is that RMT is engaging in an overstatement. However, there is more to torah than finding out whether or not I can fit my agenda through the hoops of halakhah. There are values. The question should be whether the feminist agenda is consistent with those values. But there is something wrong with a process where the question isn&#039;t being asked. Where being Orthodox is identified not only with observance of black-letter law without any sense of the goals of Orthodoxy. Rite without spirituality anyone? Is that really how we wish to define our religion?

So, Judaism is amenable to change, the community is capable of considering and amending the values it implements. But by comparing them against the Torah. Simply saying change is necessary because the zeitgeist proposes a value and our lives in the Western world has us assimilating it without that actual comparison.


Only then can we discuss the nit-picky issue of halachic process. Even if every innovation can be sourced in earlier halachic works, can they be combined against the flow of consensus and how the ideas were developed? Are we combing sources for minority opinions and promoting them against established and practiced consensus? How abruptly can significant change be absorbed by the process?

Notice my issues are on the how of the change, not the what.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; The Torah lifestyle is untouchable. It is not subject to the whims of history or the fickle winds of change.

Ha Ha Ha!

Remind me, what does “Ayin tachas ayin” mean, again? There’s a clear example of a halacha that was reinterpreted and twisted beyond all recognition because lex talonis didn’t fit the moral framework of the taanaim.

&#062; Indeed, Torah and the things that we call Torah are either oddly synchronized with external influences or are subject to the changing ideals of the outside world. 

You know the Torah True answer to that, right? They got it from us!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is, I think, related to a much deeper question.  Is Torah telling us how to construct society to serve God or how to serve God is all societies?  Obviously at some level the answer is both, and both are to be found in Chazal; however, there is, in the history of Jewish thought, a great range of views on where the emphasis lies.  The more one emphasizes the former, the more one views all  external ideas as contradicting Torah; the more one emphasizes the latter, the more one is inclined to ask which external ideas have value to Torah and which are contradictory and must be rejected outright.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But RYBS backed that up with an explicit statement of Chazal (tav lemeisav...) which he turned into an existential truth by linking it to a verse (the curses after Eden). IOW, RYBS himself used 20th century philosophy to create a halchic hazakah. If Rambam read the Torah through an Aristotelian lens, and the kabbalists through Plotinus, and RYBS through an existential lens, this &quot;immutable principle&quot; was itself a product of a response to changing hermeneutics. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe R&#039; Twersky doesn&#039;t hold from Rabbi Lamm? Or at least not the praise for female equality part.


The smallest nitpick of things rankles me so much in R&#039; Twersky&#039;s article. I can&#039;t stand when the Christian version of the bible is used for translating our Torah, especially when done incorrectly (surely Baruch Litvin misquoted the Rav because there is no way the Rav would mistranslate it himself, re: Shemot 20:13).]]></description>
