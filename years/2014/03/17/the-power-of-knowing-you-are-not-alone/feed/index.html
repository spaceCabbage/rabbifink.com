		<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t trying to express the frum viewpoint - who am I to speak for the frum community on this issue? No, what I was expressing was the rational viewpoint about so-called immutable homosexuality. It hasn&#039;t even been two generations since the APA bowed to political pressure and overturned 2000 years of knowledge to declare homosexual tendencies immutable. It is counter-intuitive, illogical, and remarkably hubristic, to think that we know more today on this subject than anyone from the past thousand years. To naively believe in the existence of some homosexual &quot;gene&quot; that researches set out to discover - and what a surprise, they discovered it! - betrays a pitiful lack of awareness of how the so-called scientific community and its funding sources operate. Indeed, the sheer ignorance the average layman has of how politicking and unabashed fraud work together to establish scientific &quot;fact&quot; is remarkable. 
It &#039;s striking how akin this issue is to Jewish scholarship. The Charedim think of themselves as the bastion of Torah scholarship when, as anyone who knows anything about academic study knows, nearly all of them are painfully ignorant of anything beyond their own narrow purview, and even within that area, what passes for &quot;learning&quot; is weak.  The same is true with regard to science. A lot of people think of themselves as believers in &quot;science&quot; and scoff - like charedim to academics - at anyone who doesn&#039;t accept global warming, immutable homosexuality, air pollution claims, and so forth. Their belief in modern scientific dogmas is every bit as entrenched as charedim in their view of the Torah. Yet,  - again, as with charedim - most of this is due to sheer ignorance. Ignorance of the massive amount of fraud within the scientific establishment. Ignorance of how lab experiments are deliberately misread, or how equally plausible reads are slanted to fit the experimenters or funder&#039;s desired results. Some people&#039;s eyes opened at the Climategate scandal, who until then thought the skpetics were total crackpots. But its like anything else. The more you read, the more you begin to see the slender reeds so much of dogma is built upon, very much including contemporary scientific dogma. As in so many other areas of life, the ones doing the mocking are usually the most ignorant in the bunch.
(Agav, E. Fink - the few comments I&#039;ve made here doesn&#039;t qualify you to get a good sense of my religious views or practices. Read my commentary to Tanach or shas, you&#039;ll have a better sense.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;even seeing with their own eyes and understanding with their own reason that their kids are doing nothing &quot;abominable&quot;.&quot;



Sorry, but I think reason has nothing to do with it nor CAN it have anything to do with it. If tomorrow you were somehow convinced Torah is the will of God, did any new metric of logic shift to show that it is NOW abominable but it wasn&#039;t before? Logic is logic whether it is from God or not. It&#039;s been a while since I read Kugel, but I don&#039;t remember Kugel ever used reason or value judgements in his work. Divine command is just that, a command. I can assure you, that outside of your own disgust (value based), you would not be able to come up with a reasononble argument (logic based) against bestiality.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tesyaa, 
It&#039;s a great question for Rav Fink.  How does he endorse/adhere to a Torah that is so at odds with his values?


Regarding &quot;toeva&quot;  specifically - it&#039;s hard to know what the Torah is getting at - it&#039;s used in several different contexts: 
from wikipedia - 
Toeva is also used in Jewish (and Christian Old Testament) scriptures to refer to:
idolatry or idols (Deuteronomy 7:25, Deuteronomy 13:14, Isaiah 44:19)
illicit sex (Ezekiel 16:22,58, Ezekiel 22:11, Ezekiel 33:26)
illicit marriage (Deuteronomy 24:2-4)
male prostitution and/or other male homosexual acts (see Homosexuality in the Hebrew Bible) and (collectively) heterosexual immorality (Leviticus 18:22, Leviticus 18:27-30, Leviticus 20:13)
temple prostitution (1Kings 14:24)
offerings from the above (Deuteronomy 23:18)
child sacrifice (Jeremiah 32:35)
cross-dressing (Deuteronomy 22:5)
cheating in the market by using rigged weights (Deuteronomy 25:13-19, Proverbs 11:1)
dishonesty (Proverbs 12:22)
dietary violations (Deuteronomy 14:3)
stealing, murder, and adultery, breaking covenants (Jeremiah 7:9,10)
usury, violent robbery, murder, oppressing the poor and needy, etc. (Ezekiel 18:10-13)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rav Fink,

Thanks for the response.

my reply...

a) You meant to say &quot;cannot be overestimated&quot;.
overestimate:   trans. To attribute too high an estimated value to (a numerical quantity); to estimate (something) to be larger, better, or more important than it really is; (also) to hold in too high estimation.

c-1)  The problem with bestiality is that it is harmful or coercive? See Hanan above.  I think you&#039;re off target here. 
c-2) I chose these examples because they represented sexual transgressions - like homosexuality - that are not practiced or attractive to the vast majority (90% ?) of people.
c-3) Why do you call these people depraved?  The torah does not recoginze it as a sin when a man has relations with a child.  These kind of relationships were common (the norm?) in biblical times, apparently still existed in talmudic times, and are practiced today in different societies.  (Don&#039;t we have a tradition that Isaac married Rebekkah when she was 3?)  If a man forces himself on a child - then he may be required to marry her and pay a fine.  That&#039;s it. 
As far as bestiality goes - if you let go of the violence aspect (I don&#039;t think that that&#039;s the issue anyways)  - i.e., imagine a case where there is no pain.  Would that remove the depravity aspect?

In short - is your use of the term  depravity confined to coercive - painful actions?]]></description>

<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>my reply&#8230;</p>
<p>a) You meant to say &#8220;cannot be overestimated&#8221;.<br />
overestimate:   trans. To attribute too high an estimated value to (a numerical quantity); to estimate (something) to be larger, better, or more important than it really is; (also) to hold in too high estimation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[a) Huh?


b) Halacha is between people and God. Love and empathy and compassion are between people and people. I am capable of parsing the two. And yes, if anything is a challenge, I think a support group would be great. Isolation makes it worse, not better.


c) You&#039;ve chosen odd examples to make your point, so I can answer your specific question without answering your general one, but i will try to do both. Any sin that harms others or requires violence or coercion to take effect is morally wrong and religiously wrong. So I wouldn&#039;t be as willing to offer a support group to sociopaths and perpetrators of violence such as pedos and zoophiles. But the general answer to your question is that yes, we should be able to talk to each other in a civil way about our struggles. Don&#039;t you think that this depraved person is in pain over the crimes he is committing? Does he not need out love too?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[PG, I think with LBGT, the issue is quite different. Incest is not a predisposition. A boy might have fallen in love with his sister, but that is about it. He can easily find another woman to take her place. There is no biological yearning to be with one&#039;s siblings or close relative (at least none that I have ever heard of) hence there is no struggle. It&#039;s a choice. Someone that is gay cannot just become hetero, hence an actual struggle. It&#039;s biological for the vast majority. Now, if bestiality was incredibly prevalent in society, than sure, why NOT give these people some support?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tova,

I was just choosing cases where a person might struggle with something the Torah forbids.  I could have brought up other cases - e.g., incest between consulting adults.  I guess I could google some more
I was asking how far you would go - would you be consistent or would you draw a line.  I think I&#039;ve identified an area where some people might struggle.  What I hear from you is that is some of theses cases  - too bad.  That person is unacceptable.  Go it alone.
But why?  Would you deny that that person is struggling?  By your own reasoning - how does it hurt to share common experiences, develop a support group?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, just to nitpick...I don&#039;t think you can rape an animal. If you can rape an animal, does that mean you can murder an animal? After all, the animal never gave you a green light to kill it for food or fur. But to play devil&#039;s advocate, I think what PG might say is, why is consent or the concept of &quot;hurting anyone&quot; even a consideration when it comes to Judaism? Certainly the Torah doesn&#039;t take those things into consideration as to what is allowed and what is forbidden. Remember, he is asking from the perspective of Judaism....not secular culture, which DOES put consent and harm as a deciding factor.

		<description><![CDATA[So I get very wary when someone brings pedophilia or bestiality into a discussion about homosexuality - those things simply cannot be equated, for many reasons. I mean, really. For one, LGBT individuals and couples and families are not harming anyone or anything except some people&#039;s sensibilities. Pedophilia and bestiality include one unwilling participant who cannot give consent. That&#039;s rape. To compare LGBT relationships to rape is ridiculous. I think you should have stopped at point b, which was a slightly better point. And my answer would be: why not find a support group for something that you struggle with? Are you really suggesting that Jews who struggle with things should struggle in silence, and that&#039;s somehow better?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R. Fink, Tova,

a) The power of this feeling cannot be &quot;underestimated.&quot; - perhaps overestimated ?

b) I agree with your ethics.  But is this orthodox Judaism?  When halacha disagrees with your morality what should you do?
If some one says homosexuality is a challenge, shabbos, kashrus, taharas hamishpacha is a challenge - what do you say - I&#039;ll find you a support group?
What is orthodox Judaism/halacha - a nice idea - or God&#039;s will?

c) And, how consistent are you - what if someone&#039;s inclinations don&#039;t agree with your sense of morality - pedophilic or bestial - do you still say - well, we all have our struggles - and steer him to the appropriate support group?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Besides, how healthy is it for people to adhere to Jewish law from a place of pain? It’s hard for me to believe that this is good for Judaism overall.&quot;

Aren’t the curses in Deuteronomy and Leviticus, and the whole idea of “losing your place in the world to come” a way of getting people to relate to Judaism out of fear? Didn’t hashem hold a mountain over the heads of the Jews in order to get them to agree to the convenant?

If you look at Christianity, they are pretty hard on those who don’t buy their story. 

Judaism has its fair share of horror stories for those who don’t comply.

It’s not healthy, but Judaism is the good, bad and ugly, no?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, 100 percent. One of the things I really disliked about my Jewish community growing up was how secretive people felt they had to be about problems and struggles. Airing dirty laundry, and all that. I didn&#039;t understand then and I don&#039;t understand now. EVERYONE has struggles. It&#039;s simply exhausting to pretend otherwise, and so completely isolating for the people experiencing them. I remember the feeling I got after I met other people with anorexia, and other people who lost pregnancies, and other people who struggled with Orthodoxy, etc. etc. - and it was always instant comfort, amid the pain. And I guess that&#039;s what I hope I accomplish with writing about these things: that other people derive some kind of comfort from seeing their own struggles out there for all the world to see, and that they know they are not alone. I think that&#039;s probably a big reason why so many people follow your writing as well, Eli.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You write about &quot;LGBT children&quot; as though that was their identity that cannot be changed, as opposed to their predisposition that can. In this, you are in agreement with the current generation&#039;s view of homosexuality. I reject that, as do many others, as did every generation until this one, in which no one is free to speak his true opinion. This post, consequently, is meaningless.  At best, it expresses the generic type of touchy-feelyness that makes the writers of such squish feel nice about themselves, without actually saying something. 
Not that I disagree with the phenomenon of knowing that others have the same predisposition is something of note. From the power of the internet, millions of individuals have discovered that notions they thought they were alone in, from political viewpoints to sexual fetishes to daydreams and fantasies, are shared by countless others. [Homosexual activity, though, even by orthodox Jews, is not in this category, certainly not today, when it is not only publicly trumpeted, but actually celebrated as though something to be proud of.] The jury is still out, in my opinion, as to whether these gradual realizations, of the existence of like-minded communities, is a good thing or not. While not having fully considered the matter yet, it seems to me that some viewpoints might be better off being kept underground, even though many people share them. That&#039;s an anti-libertarian viewpoint, but perhaps a necessary one.]]></description>
