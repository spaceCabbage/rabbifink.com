		<description><![CDATA[Can somebody please explain to me what these studies did? I looked at the article but it&#039;s still not clear to me. They did various things to encourage people to think analytically, and afterwards those people seemed to have less religious belief than the control group. But did anyone check their religious beliefs BEFORE the study? I can&#039;t believe that people with firm religious beliefs would suddenly become atheists in half an hour because someone showed them a statue (which one of the studies seems to have done) or encouraged them to analyze their thoughts. This has nothing to do with my own religious beliefs. It just seems outrageously unrealistic. People don&#039;t change their beliefs so quickly. Am I missing something?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;
The orthodox Jew should not allow analytical thinking affect his belief in God. Our belief does not depend on unanswered questions or unexplainable phenomena. So as more questions are answered by science we should not feel threatened. Thus, the view that analytical thinking promotes disbelief in religion should come as no surprise to us, nor should it be perceived as any threat. &quot;

I think the yidish expression really means you shouldn&#039;t be afraid to ask questions even if you dont get an answer.  I started writing a whole essay on which is more important. Questions or Answers.For every answer science gives it opens up a whole new arena of questions. Of course we gain much from the answers, the modern world is built on that. But it was the questions that brought about the answers that made it happen. And its the questions after the answer that will lead to more knowledge. Stop babbling dovid!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hear you.

Neither of us KNOW how different &quot;forms&quot; of belief would fare in this experiment so we are only offering educated guesses.

I still think that most people are God of the Gaps believers and that contributed to the effect of the study. We diverge on who would fare better. I think that any non-God of the Gaps believer would improve their &quot;score&quot; while you think that  a believer based on [pesudo] science would improve their score even more.

But I think you do agree that BOTH would fare better.

And so, since one of my core beliefs is that religious beliefs and God cannot be proved, and these strange creatures are so rare, I can eliminate the [pseudo] science believer from the discussion leaving me with only the God of the Gaps and the non-God of the Gaps to contrast.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I should note that there is an actual very simple answer to your question.


&quot;Is it reasonable to believe in something that correlates with lack of analytical thinking and that analytical thinking causes it to be disbelieved?&quot;

Yes and yes. Just because something correlates with a lack of analytical thinking does not mean it is wrong. In fact this type of question strays dangerously close to the genetic fallacy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy.

Likewise for part b, that analytical thinking causes it to be disbelieved. That&#039;s irrelevant. If I have reason to believe something I&#039;ll believe it on the basis of that merit. Just because other people believe it for different reasons shouldn&#039;t concern me.

Consider the following the situation:

People are invited to participate in a lottery system. On the face of it, it seems that your expected gain from wagering $10 is approximately $9. 

You prime people in two different ways. The ones who you prime to think analytically will avoid wagering money, because they expect to lose. The ones who you prime with Nike commercials all go for it.

Now imagine I&#039;m a mathematician, with a specialty in probability theory (and moreover, I actually have a good grasp of probability, which isn&#039;t true of all specialists in the field, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem.) Looking at how the lottery is structured, I recognize that the expected payoff of wagering $10 is actually $12. What should I do? I should wager! Yes, many people before went this route due to ignorance. That is the way the world works. That doesn&#039;t effect my mathematical ability.

I&#039;m surprised that many would view this study as problematic. I expect to vote in the Presidential Elections for the same candidate as roughly 50% of a populace that knows virtually nothing about politics. Does this invalidate my vote? Of course not. It is important to recognize ignorance, and even to therefore question your own knowledge. But at the end of the day you&#039;re not all the other people. And you have a choice to make.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was clear to begin with, with the exception of what appeared to be an argument for a &quot;third way,&quot; something akin to analytic thought, but that justifies God. 

&quot;The existence of God and God’s instructions function outside the common area of intuition and analysis. They are a separate mode of thinking. They cannot be proved nor are they intuitive. They function in a completely different way. It is beyond the scope of this post to propose what kind of thinking justifies religious belief.&quot;  . You still haven&#039;t explained what that is about, so there isn&#039;t much further I can say on the matter now.

I took issue with your contention that analytic thought is not a threat to faith, because it is fairly clear to me that faith involves temporarily disabling or ignoring analytic thought. Hence the &quot;two switches&quot; metaphor. 

I didn&#039;t consider the other side of the coin, which you&#039;ve brought to my attention. Someone who is convinced, whether by Gerald Schroeder or simply an ignoramus who points out &quot;the ridiculousness of evolution&quot; that science argues for God, is unlikely to suddenly change his view when prompted to think analytically. In fact, analytic thinking should promote his religious belief, as he considers the impossibility of the universe without &quot;the God of the Gaps.&quot; 

It&#039;s precisely the other type of individual, who doesn&#039;t perceive belief in God as a consequence of rational analysis, who is likely to express more skepticism, when primed to think scientifically. Your alternative here seems closer to the default, and certainly the less safe of the options placed before us. Someone raised on Creationism, Young-Earthism and other forms of pseudo-science will not suddenly discover Carbon Dating and Natural Selection when primed to think scientifically, and his analytic thought will revolve around the sciences he has. However, when one leaps between the pillars of faith and the pillars of empiricism, if we lure him to the side of empiricism, he will be lured. And I think that&#039;s precisely what this study shows.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure you fully understood what I was saying.

There are two sides to this coin. On the side of &quot;priming for analytical thinking will result in less belief&quot; I think that one who does not believe in the God of the Gaps will have less of a problem with this than one who believes in the God of the Gaps.

The other side to the coin is whether analysis and science should be viewed as a threat. That is solved by the &quot;reasonable irrational belief&quot; that I promote for orthodox Jews. Yes it is based on faith. But that is NOT as dangerous in the &quot;priming for analytical thinking will result in less belief&quot; experiment because you don&#039;t expect your beliefs to stand up to the rigors of analytical thinking.

Clearer?]]></description>

This is a bit of a cop out answer. I admit. That’s because we almost always prefer analysis to intuition when we make important decisions.&quot;

Or to quote Ibn Ezra: כי לא נתנה התורה לאשר אין דעת לו, והמלאך בין אדם ובין אלהיו הוא שכלו
Or Koheleth: וראיתי אני שיש יתרון לחכמה מן־הסכלות כיתרון האור מן־החשך. חכם עיניו בראשו והכסיל בחשך הולך 

And yet...
&quot;The existence of God and God’s instructions function outside the common area of intuition and analysis. They are a separate mode of thinking. They cannot be proved nor are they intuitive. They function in a completely different way. It is beyond the scope of this post to propose what kind of thinking justifies religious belief.&quot; 

I must say then, I would rather see that other post. Because I know of no alternative way of thinking that is not rational analysis and yet equivalent to it. And I don&#039;t think you have that way of thinking.

You conclude with:
&quot;We have a strong tradition of asking question, challenging ideas, and thinking analytically. We should continue to embrace this tradition and not be afraid of what we might learn or discover as we are confident that we have the truth.&quot;

Now it sounds as if you are resorting to &quot;faith&quot;.  &quot;The orthodox Jew should not allow analytical thinking affect his belief in God,&quot; because he should be confident that he has the truth. But you&#039;ve given no grounds for this confidence in your post. And so, the thinker will return to what his mind his given him to work with. And yes, when you turn the faith switch off, and the intellectual search for truth switch on... you will tend to lose people. There seems to be a dream of a &quot;third switch&quot; underlying this article. But there is no third switch to be seen.]]></description>
