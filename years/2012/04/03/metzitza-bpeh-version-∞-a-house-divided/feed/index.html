		<description><![CDATA[Please link to the comment you are referring to, should not be too hard since you claim it has happened more than once. 

Where here have I shown intolerance towards anyone? I wrote about a book, that is all. I did not attack any people as you are doing here. 

Just as a hypothetical, even if I attacked the Torah, ie the Adam story makes little sense, that would not be an attack on a person, nor would it show any intolerance towards anyone or any community. 

pot kettle et al. all this is about is you not liking my opnion and lowering yourself to purposely confuse what Ive written with intolerance and to make personal attacks against me. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recognize your name from this blog and a very common thread is attacking anything remotely to the right.  Being anon takes nothing away from my comment nor would it add if i wasn&#039;t anon.  Your curiosity will not be satisfied.  I am not standing for any view on MBP and my comment had nothing to do with the topic. I said be respectful especially since you always scream about the lack of tolerance of the right. Your comment couldn&#039;t be any less tolerant.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sir, the fair rabbi and I are not equal in terms of how we must present our opnions.

R Fink, in his capacity as a Rabbi, scholar, and writer must show respect to his subjects. 

I, on the other hand, am a mere internet commentator, a single lone observer and watcher, and I have nobody looking up to me or seeking advice from me, and therefor I can say and do what I choose. 

I dont hate anyone to the right of me, the athor of this book isnt to the right of me. Its a book and I have an opinion about it. You claim to know me or recognize my name, so why dont you not comment anon and show that you really care abot your view. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know what happened to the threaded reply, but I&#039;ll say it here: the problem is that the entire thing cannot be divorced from the battle over Reform and approaches to modernity. While I agree that from the Chassidic perspective the Chasam Sofer&#039;s declaration that mysticism has nothing to do with us, so it can&#039;t play a role in this question, is unacceptable, we are discussing why there is so much emotion and attachment to it - and I can&#039;t see how kabbalah comes into it. There are gazillions of kabbalistic practices that are not seen as so important. Did you ever see anyone get heated about yom kippur kattan? It would be interesting if we had some kind of test case, which involved kabbalah and was never a flashpoint in the battles over Reform, modernity, and government interference, so we can see if such emotions and passions were possible about such a thing. But alas, we do not. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why are you always so disrespectful of sources you dislike.  So you don&#039;t believe in mysticism, neither does R&#039;Fink (so it seems from the article), but at least he is respectful of their school of thought.  He makes no claim to its falsehood, nor any disdain for the author either.  It is clear you have a bias against them, and cannot logically argue with them.  Take your emotions out of it and stop hating on anyone to the right of you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure. The question is why they overruled and why we continue to overrule. It&#039;&#039;s not farfetched to draw the lines of this issue along mystical vs. rational. Heck, even the idea that this was settled 150 years ago and opening it again would be prohibited is a mystical view!]]></description>
