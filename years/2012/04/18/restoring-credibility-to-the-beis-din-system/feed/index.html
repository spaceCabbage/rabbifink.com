Also, district court opinions are never published. The opinions that we read are mostly from appeals. There are no appeals in Beis Din so the correlation is not perfect anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure, but it seems like they are only publishing select decisions, which is a shame.  It would certainly be unprecedented (no pun intended), unconventional, and raise some halachic issues, but I think it would be great if they started publishing a reporter, and made the parties&#039; consent to publication part of their arbitration agreement/shtar birur.

		<description><![CDATA[Appreciate the honesty.

Unfortunately, I don&#039;t know anyone that has had a positive experience in beis din.  Just story after story of corruption, judges advocating for the opposing side, exorbitant costs, shaky logic, etc.

This combined with the constant deluge of corruption across left/right wing Orthodoxy has really left me dejected.]]></description>
