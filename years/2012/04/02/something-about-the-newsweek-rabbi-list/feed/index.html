		<description><![CDATA[If you go back 25-30 years you will see Orthodox had a few key Rabbanim, like Reb Moshe Feinstein zt&#039;l who led the whole community as a whole.  We had true mesorah and leadership.  The issue I see for today is we have lost that trait.  With so many people receiving Smicha, and making their own Psak, people out doing each other we keep upping what is considered &quot;Frum.&quot;  We have lost the advent of people having a Rav to go to. 

Consider I went to Yeshiva for Elementary school, then a different Yeshiva for High School, then some go to Eretz Yisroel.  Hopefully get married, live in a community.  Who is the Rav that you are associated with, where is that connection that we rely on.  I will go one step further on Mesorah.  If I ask a question to most Ravs where there is differences in opinion based on Chasidich, Msnagid, Litvuk, etc...  Most Rabbonim will give a Psak.  Very few will ask can you ask your father what your Menhog is.  I sadly see a world where we lose the normal Gedoliim, who are approachable to the average person.  
As far as the list goes, I look at ALL the names on it and laugh at their attempt at wooing me to buy their magazine.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@MarkSoFla:disqus 
1) is very true, and many are not happy. One breakoff yeshiva already opened as you well know. My work brings me to Washington Hghts on occasion and more than 50% of the ppl on the street on dressed like the people in Beth Medrash Gavoah. Of course clothing doesnt mean anything, but it means they are more comfortable identyfing with the right than ever before. 

2) I once read a good comment: &quot;if each generation was allowed their own changes in the name of progress over the past 2,000 years, Judaism today would be completely unrecognizable to that of the Rabbis&quot; - of course it has changes a whole hell of a lot anyway, but in spirit its the same. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, I wonder what R&#039;HS reaction would be to these three items:

1. &quot;pushed Yeshiva University to the right&quot; ... perhaps he might agree and consider it a good thing. Perhaps much of the Orthodox world considers this a good thing?
2. &quot;against various forms of modernity in the name of preserving rigorous Halacha&quot; ... I think he would definitely agree that this one is good and critical for Orthodox Jews. I mean, who could possibly be against &quot;preserving rigorous halacha&quot; from the onslaught of modernity?
3. &quot;dominant, intimidating force behind the RCA&quot; ... I think he might support the first adjective and not the second.

I am very interested in knowing who exactly wrote the blurbs - there is no way someone outside the Jewish world (or outside the Jewish orthodox world) wrote them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent essay rabbi. 

Firstly, what they wrote about Rabbis Shachter and Kaminestsky happen to be true, but of course the question is whether the holding back of progress is all they are good for. I personally can&#039;t list any benefit I recieve from either rabbis as a member of the Orthodox contingent (especially since I disagree with much of their views and opinions, particullary the ones listed in this very essay.) Other than reading Shachter&#039;s books or occasionally hearing him speak I have no direct connection to him. 

The transition of rabbinic control from the pultpit rabbi to the Yeshiva dean was a huge error that has resulted in much of the problems we are seeing today. 

Very simply, the pulpit rabbi, whose job it is to deal with the laypeople and answer their lay related questions is someone who lives in the layperson&#039;s world and can generally relate to his or her life. Therefor any answers or advice were grounded in real world experience. 

However, the Yeshiva Dean, whose main goal is to seperate himself from the world, to remain alone in the four walls of the Study Hall, has zero knowledge of the layperson&#039;s life and has no experience in the real world and his advice and opinions cannot represent real world and correct ideas. 

TL;DR: taking advice and halachic rulings from Yeshiva Heads is like taking stock market advice from a tibetan monk.]]></description>
