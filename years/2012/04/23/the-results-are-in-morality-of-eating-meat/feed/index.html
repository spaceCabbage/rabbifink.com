		<description><![CDATA[Hey I just re-read what i wrote.  Is there a reason you stopped the quote where you did?  Here&#039;s the full quote:

&quot;because animals have more in common with plants than they do us with us, despite our physical (non-intellectual) similarities,&quot;



I anticipated the DNA argument right there!!!  What goes?  I&#039;d really like R&#039; Fink to answer my question about eating meat being a &quot;concession,&quot; though.  That does nto seem to be anywhere in rabbinic tradition (aside from the midrash about not eating meat until after noakh).  And the Jews ate s&#039;lav in the midbar and talk about the fish and meat they ate in mitsrayim.  Couldn&#039;t have been that verboten.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;because animals have more in common with plants than they do us with us&quot;

This is untrue. Humans and animals have MUCH more DNA in common than animals and plants have in common. That&#039;s because humans ARE animals (kingdom-wise).

		<description><![CDATA[I meant the &quot;concession&quot; part.  And what about the s&#039;lav?  Or do you literally mean basar b&#039;hema v&#039;khaya and not of?

My point is that we don&#039;t see anywhere rabanim talking about not eating meat as a midat khasidut that I&#039;m aware of (and certainly not widespread).  So my inference is that whatever happened was not a concession, but a neutral thing at the very least.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is that a monolithic opinion?  I have heard it before, but it certainly doesn&#039;t seem to have been accepted by k&#039;lal yisrael...  


I have a hard time with &quot;ethics&quot; outside of religion.  And by that, I don&#039;t mean ethics outside of &quot;halakha&quot; (pace R&#039; Lichtenstein), but without any belief that the world was created for a purpose and there&#039;s reward and punishment.  But if I don&#039;t believe in G-d, I&#039;d still say it&#039;s neutral.  We&#039;re at the top of the food chain.  Why is it unethical?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spurred, not spurned.

Why is the onus on why eating meat is ethical?  Why isn&#039;t the question why is it unethical?  Why is the burden on the people who are doing what we have done for thousands of years?  Kabbalists say it gathers the ntisotsot from the meat and helps gilgulim make their way up the chain (interestingly Hindus avoid it for the same latter reason).

I can&#039;t tell you why it&#039;s &quot;ethical&quot; (since I&#039;m not a Kabbalist), but I can tell you that since it&#039;s not &quot;unethical&quot; because animals have more in common with plants than they do us with us, despite our physical (non-intellectual) similarities, there&#039;s no reason we can&#039;t go on eating it.  Or producing it en masse.  hashem gave us the natural world to enjoy as He permitted.  So it&#039;s a neutral thing.]]></description>
