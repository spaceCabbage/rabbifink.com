		<description><![CDATA[The Agudah does not stand for unity. They (at least in the past) did not invite gedolim that they did not consider inside their camp to sit on top while every no-name  rebbe and rosh yeshiva did. 
With respect, your personal feelings of enjoying the siyum hashas you attended seem to cloud your usual balanced perspective. It could be that since some kanayoish Agudah members have passed away this event will be less political, but make no mistake, it is a political organization and there is loads of politics in the planning of this event. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;
To those who are boycotting the siyum I say, you are on the wrong side of this issue.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;


It depends what you mean by &quot;boycott&quot;. I&#039;m not going to the Agudah siyum and am instead going to the Modern Orthodox siyum the following Monday. But I&#039;m not putting down the Agudah siyum, I just prefer the MO one. Here&#039;s what I wrote to people in my shul, trying to interest people in the MO siyum:


&quot;There is another, more modern Orthodox Siyum HaShas (http://www.siyumhashas12.com) taking place in NYC one week later. It does not conflict with the Agudah event and is not meant to replace it. I will be attending that one, as I find the inclusion of women and a more open approach to learning to be more in line with my hashkafah.&quot;]]></description>
