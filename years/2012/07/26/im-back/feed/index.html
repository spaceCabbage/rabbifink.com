		<description><![CDATA[Has Agudah published a final speaker lineup with only 10 days until the event?  If Rabbi Lau is the most &quot;modern&quot; speaker (to the Viznitz anyway) then it can&#039;t be too representative of the Orthodoxy as a whole.  I don&#039;t know what makes it moderate, other than the balance of English to Yiddish speakers will likely be in  favor of English.   So, if that&#039;s moderate, fine - it&#039;s still hardly representative of the OJ community.

I completely understand if the aforementioned rabbis did not want to be part of a &quot;breakaway&quot;.   However, it&#039;s interesting that they initially chose to participate, their names were on the list, if I recall,  Rabbi Sherman was even the host.   Certainly, they understood that this was a &quot;breakaway&quot; before they agreed to participate.  No explanation was given, so we&#039;re left to speculate... unless someone like yourself wants in investigate  :-)   . Unfortunately, it seems the most plausible explanation is that they came under pressure from the right to the tow the party line. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a big fan of the Siyum HaShas that Agudah arranges. I don&#039;t think it is a good thing when subgroups make their own Siyums.
