In your analogy, it would be akin to you getting enjoyment because three people at your table ordered Salmon and liked it, and you have Salmon on your team.  You still get to eat (be a fan of a team), but now you have added enjoyment where you&#039;d have none (other people&#039;s choices and their enjoyment = players on other teams that are &quot;yours&quot;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh I don&#039;t doubt it was unintentional, but there is a certain relationship. Obviously there is more substance in advanced metrics than there is in Fantasy sports, but both involve focusing less on traditional notions of watching and evaluating sports and looking more at numbers.

&quot;Sports are not about compiling numbers&quot; pretty much sums up the entire philosophy of the Joe Morgan/scouts/old media establishment that can&#039;t stand the SABR community/Beane, et al.]]></description>

For  me, understanding the probabilities of events has really helped me deal with ups and downs in my daily life.  But there&#039;s not really anyone I can talk to who thinks the same way.
