		<description><![CDATA[I have not read the Hirsh-Bamberger controversy - I will look for it.  It seems strange that Jews should create enormous barriers between one another when Tanach (written Bible) illustrates hundreds of years of Jews (who lived closer to Matan Torah (Sinai) living and working together (and warring and killing one another - like typical relatives) who worshiped and gave allegience in radically different ways.  Even brothers/tribes (Reuven and Shimon) that did not receive blessings from Yaakov had a place in the Land and were part of the community.  Even the tribes of Reuven, Gad, and half of Menasha, who sought to live outside of the the Land and were chastised for it, regardless of the apoligetics and rationalizations, were an integral part of the Klal (Community of Israel or, at least, the Nation).  And, where are the wars described in Tanach (1st Temple period) both praised AND considered for the sake of G-d?  The prophets spent their time with the idol worshippers and with the corrupt kings, etc.  Members of the &quot;elders&quot;, there actually was not a group called the &quot;Sanhedrin&quot; until the 2nd Temple, were corrupt but we all still stayed together, not to mention the corrupt priests of the 2nd Temple period.  Most likely, some of the most reliable Torah artifacts (ie, Codes of the Written Torah such as the Aleppo Codex, thanks for the book suggestion, came from the domain of the Karaites/Masorites.)

Just as Torah describes G-d&#039;s creation as incurring mistake after mistake after mistake and regret by G-d over and over again, yet G-d continues on and promises light from this darkness (and, after all, G-d created the mess and us), so maybe we should all continue with the enterprise together.  Any thought of the requirement for purity has been over for thousands of years.  So, we&#039;ll just have to go forward all together.  There are plenty of Mitzvot that Conservative, Reform, Orthodox, etc etc etc, women and men, etc do that bind us together.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, I thought the civil war settled the question of whether you can secede. Never mind, on second thought, Romney swept every state of the confederacy except the swing states, FL and VA. Even there he would have won if they counted Black  votes as 3/5 of white vote. These guys don&#039;t want to secede, they just want to get inside a giant time machine and go back to 1860. 


I understand that many Southerners never got over emancipation. An African American president has to be especially galling to them. 


I hope the White House reply to their petitions is, &quot;Get over it! You lost the civil war and the Election!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The idea of the secession is no more than driven by an anger a painful and naive reaction to the unexpected loss by their candidate. It has no political, economical and practical substance. The shallow honor of insignificant group of Texans. Also, I believe that any dismemberment is nonsense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice analysis. It&#039;s very sad to see the level to which these people think they want to go. It reminds me of a small child who threatens his parents that he wants to run away, blissfully unaware of the consequences. As a side note, it&#039;s illegal for a state to secede. The Civil War settled that question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course, the famous disagreement between Rabbis Hirsch and Bamberger over Torah-observant Jews&#039; duty to secede from official institutional communities controlled by Reform Jews (since Reform Jews constituted a significant majority of the Jewish communal population at the time).  There are good arguments on both sides of the issue, but it boils down to two issues: (1) How do we distinguish between legitimate disagreement with Jews who do things differently than we do and conduct that sets other Jews completely outside the pale of rabbinic Judaism; (2) What does association with an institutional organization mean - does it indicate (tacit) approval of that institution&#039;s policies and the views that underlie them, or does it amount to nothing more than a matter of convenience and a need to have your own means met through association with a powerful organization that can meet those needs (even it it acts in ways diametrically opposed to your most fundamental principles).

As applied to these petitions, or to the secession movement generally (yes, it is a movement), the issues similarly boil down to (1) How do we distinguish between legitimate disagreement about what the constitution and Constitution of the United States requires/allows, and between clear and illegitimate violations of the basic legitimizing fabric of the nation; and (2) Assuming the latter characterized the current state of the Federal government, what is the appropriate response.

These petitions are admittedly a rather juvenile way of venting anger about the results of last week&#039;s elections.  But for those more thoughtful on the issue, they (wrongly, in my view) view President Obama&#039;s reelection as yet another symbol of the Federal government rejection of what they see as acceptable bounds for constitutional government, and more importantly as a sign that so many of the people of the several States with which they are associated are not bothered by (what they view as) the illegitimate violation of Constitutional norms.]]></description>
