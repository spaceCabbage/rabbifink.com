		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I just started looking at your blog. In case you might see this, I&#039;m pretty sure Rav Kook deals with this issue at length. I believe he has a famous piece in Orot HaKodesh called &quot;HaShleimut V&#039;Hishtalmut,&quot; where he says that being totally &quot;perfect&quot; itself is a lacking since it precludes the ability to become &quot;more perfect.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Normally not a fan of Boteach whatsoever, but I always appreciated this piece:

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-shmuley-boteach/the-tyranny-of-perfection_b_514338.html?view=print

Judaism struggles, I think, with the problem of how to keep God immanent without making God into a Christ-figure, a God too material and too close and too humanlike, and how to keep God transcendent without making God too distant and empty and impersonal.

This is also interesting, if a little listless:

		<description><![CDATA[Without getting involved from the philosophical point of view, it seems like the gemara (and later halakha generally) has the assumption that revelation is perfect because God is perfect. Even if this pov solves many questions, do you think it&#039;s possible to entertain this idea while accepting God as perfect for the purposes of halakha?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Premise 1) Hashem created mankind so that He could give them enjoyment in Olam Habo.

Question 1) Why then are we in this world? Why didn’t Hashem place us directly into Olam Habo so that we can immediately fulfill our purpose?

 Answer 1) Because in order for us to fully enjoy Olam Habo, we must earn it.


Question 2) So why didn’t Hashem create us in such a way that we could enjoy it fully without earning it?


Answer 2) Because Hashem wanted to create being similar to Himself, “btzelem elokim,” and such being need to earn their enjoyment to fully appreciate it.


Question 3) So why didn’t Hashem create beings btzelem elokim that can enjoy olam habo without earning it?


Answer 3) Because that’s a logical impossibility, like making square circles.


Conclusion) Hashem’s omnipotence is limited to what’s logically possible.


You’re saying that Hashem could have made us btzelem elokim AND capable of fully enjoying Olam Habo without first earning it, but chose not to. Which leaves us still with Question 3, and ultimately with Question 1. If you answer that He chose to make us go through this world for some inscrutable reason, that’s fine, but that’s not what the Mesilas Yesharim says, and my original point was that the frum world accepts the MY’s limit on Hashem’s omnipotence without any complaints.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I remember correctly, the whole point of the discussion was to explain why, if the whole poiont of our existence is to go to Olam Habo so Hashem can give us pleasure, we have to experience this world, with all of its evils and temptation to sin, instead of going directly to Olam Habo. The answer is that for us to be able to get the most pleasure, we have to have earned it.

If Hashem had merely chosen to create us with the need to earn reward, rather than it being a requirement imposed upon Him, the question remains.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To me it seems that there are two different conversations to have about G-d. One is in the abstract that He is perfect in every way, unfathomable by human beings. I don&#039;t see where there is room for any derivation of this idea within Orthodox belief.

The second is to talk about how He relates to the imperfect world and imperfect humanity that He designed. As we look through the course of history, sometimes He chooses to relate to the world and to man in a more natural way and sometimes not. Either way, He designed the world in a way that can only relate to Him in an imperfect way. When the Torah describes Him &quot;changing his mind&quot; or &quot;surprised and frustrated&quot;, it&#039;s not describing Him at His essence, but rather man&#039;s perception of Him. Is there any classic Jewish thought that does not have this approach?

I don&#039;t understand how this factors into what you are asking. It seems that Hazony is in a sense making a case for the richness of Judaism in understanding G-d as we relate to him as imperfect beings but what does that have to do with the Perfect G-d acting with more or less omni powers as he guides humanity? 


Who within Ultra-Orthodoxy actually believes that everything that we experience in this world is perfect? From my experience, what is believed is that the imperfect world that we see right now is the perfect system for what it was designed to do - namely, to challenge individuals to attain their purpose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, the limitations of trying to use our language to make sense of G-d. 
I hear the point Hazony is trying to make and appreciate you bringing his piece to attention. However, I think there is something inherently wrong with with asking &quot;which track is more likely to produce the desired result of devout believers&quot; or &quot;which track has a better chance of survival&quot;. Trying to gain a greater understanding of G-d&#039;s role in our lives is a personal struggle. While it is to be expected that Rabbis, philosophers, whomever, will try to create a framework to explain and resolve conflicts to the masses, using the aforementioned reasoning as a rationale to debate these questions sounds too much like an effort at brainwashing or potentially sacrificing honesty for what will be more readily and widely accepted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The “All-Everything” God suffers from the Problem of Evil. In practice, the only way to solve the Problem and come up with a decent theodicy is to limit one of the Omnis. For example, the Ramchal in the Mesilas Yesharim states that we need to experience this world because we need to earn our reward in Olam Haboh in order to fully appreciate it. This implies that Hashem is incapable of creating us in such a way that we could fully appreciate Olam Haboh without earning it – a limit on His omnipotence. The frum world seems to tolerate the limitation without any problems. Possibly because most people don’t think about it at all. 


Which leads to, the answer to “which track is more likely to produce the desired result of devout believers” is without a doubt the mystical and maximal one. Firstly, people generally aren’t inclined to theological musings. Most people just aren’t interested. Therefore a simplistic, maximalist, idealized God is preferable for retaining the faith of the average person. Secondly, as a rule, the less people understand rituals, the more likely they are to perpetuate them. If someone can explain in practical terms why he is performing a given mitzvah, and the practical reason no longer applies, the reasonable thing to do is discontinue the practice. If the mitzvah is being done primarily for “deep” mystical, unknowable rasons that pull strings in the olam shel emes and have profound metaphysical effects, then the practice will continue even if there is absolutely no practical reason for it.]]></description>
