		<description><![CDATA[The Mishna is uniquely didactive (sic? )  it gives no reason or rhyme for its laws

 the Gemoroh  in  contrast  is  deductive and runs in total contrast to the  mishna.

 it will therefore override the tannaic law when  the standard code off logic and inference is used.

 However, it still needs to work within the limits already set by the mishna

 therefore, even if Rabbi meir was  the  author of the brocho S.A. ISHA  etc  even if the majority  disagreed, his ruling would
 still have passed.
 that&#039;s not too say that it was unanimously accepted just because the bracha remained as part of our daily teffilot

 Secondly,
 let&#039;s  be rational here, EVERY HUMAN BEING RIGHTEOUS OR OTHERWISE IS SUBJECTIVE
 either from personal experiences, genetics, and  especially from the local culture they were immersed in.

 we think today as contemporary 21st  century westerners.

 the tannaim  and ammoraim, particularly those that lived in the highly Helenized  culture of  Roman occupied Israel.

ie,rabbi Yehudah who as confirmed  wrote the litany of the  contentious  morning Brochot.
ironically I recently read that the brochot were actually plagiarized  from the  early Greeks

 they used to have a common ditty

 Thanks that I&#039;m not a women ( perceived as passive and not like the appreciated active male)

 Thanks that I&#039;m not a slave

 and thanks that I&#039;m not a Barbarian ( they called them that, as their language sounded like &quot;bar..bar&quot;!  etc

 Ironic enough,
 that the original version from rabno eunuchs  states... he did not make me a “BUR&quot;
 meaning obviously the original Barbarian..

 however Rashi  translates  the  word  as בור  meaning  ignaramous ... therefore we praise Hashem that we
 are not stupid as him! 

 obviously in the final cut... the original Barbarian and it&#039;s Hebrew misinterpretation  were edited out.

 obviously RE  is an apologist, but at least for his part I can say that I admire the Rov, for going against the
 NON  subjective  anti feminist norms, and  has his own moral convictions and personal ethical compass
 that makes him unique by not jumping on the bandwagon, and by sticking his neck out..

 and noch  three weeks in a row. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just went through all the comments. Seems I&#039;m late to the party as I see some people have offered their answers to this.

One answer is that he had political power. (Perhaps we could back that assertion up by chazal&#039;s own statement about R&quot;M continuing to learn from Achere - &quot;If not for the fact that you are R&quot;M we would have put you in cherem.&quot;

Rav Yisroel Salanter would not be happy with this whole discussion. He wrote that Shamai could have been just as caring as Hillel. His behavior was a result of his psak about kavod haTorah. And IIRC he writes there that all of chazal were like that. - Clearly the TT disagrees. He writes that R&quot;M&#039;s psak came from his mindset.


Rabbi Fink I realize that you are just trying to understand things from the TT&#039;s position, but really, isn&#039;t his position seriously flawed? If an halacha is based on a subjective personal view, and when the majority disagrees and yet it gets fixed into law for thousands of years because of politics and power, why keep that halacha? Either we shouldn&#039;t or the TT got it wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi FInk, please help me understand... If everyone else disagreed with the notion of nashim datan kalos and if the bracha of shelo asani isha is linked to that concept, how come everyone agreed to say the bracha of shelo asani isha?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;The only &quot;tradition&quot; we have of the sordid story of Brueria is that statement found in Rash. We do not have his source&lt;/i&gt;

But the TT seemed to think it was authoritative. I only mention this because we are discussing HIS state of mind, not the objective truth.

&lt;i&gt;there is a note there stating that the Gra rejects the authenticity of this latter story&lt;/i&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[The only &quot;tradition&quot; we have of the sordid story of Brueria is that statement found in Rash. We do not have his source, I once discussed this Rashi with Prof. D Sperber - who raised some questions regarding the use of language in the Rashi - and said he has questions weather the story is authentically a part of Rashi - or somehow added on - this was his supposition - perhaps he will write about this. The other part of the story is the tale of Rabbi Meir&#039;s &quot;fall&quot; which is real poetic justice for the Brueria story. see Seder Hadorot under letter &quot;m&quot; (page 507 in the edition I have at home) there is a note there stating that the Gra rejects the authenticity of this latter story

		<description><![CDATA[I would distinguish between &quot;q&quot;, which is academic usage, and &quot;ss&quot; which could be from any of the Edot haMizrach and &quot;w&quot; which shows a faith in Yemenite accent. My bet is that those who use all three are more likely to be textualist, &quot;Qaraites&quot; of the Rambam or Talmud Bavli, who want to fix things. There aren&#039;t too many commentors on-line who are transliterating Yemenite because it&#039;s their tradition.


And if they want to fix things, then they&#039;re of the sort who think the norm is broken. So, yes, the greater likelihood of being on the left makes sense.



That said, I&#039;m a &quot;q&quot; user who wears a kapote on Shabbos and Yom Tov. &quot;Correlation&quot; doesn&#039;t mean the rule is reliable. Especially without the full suite of emendations.

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; David bar Hayim has an idiosyncratic view of the role of accepted pesaq and of minhag. He is the one trying to restore Nusach Eretz Yisrael, based on quotes in the Yerushalmi and fragments in the Cairo Geniza. (I&#039;m not sure how -- there are at least 4 different nusachos for the Amidah in the Geniza, and the Yerushalmi doesn&#039;t quote tefillah often enough to choose in most cases. But that is a different discussion.)


But someone who doesn&#039;t think &quot;because that&#039;s the baseline of all nusachos today&quot; gives  what we -- from Yekkes to Yemenites -- agree upon about Seder Rav Amram Gaon special authority isn&#039;t going to have the usual arguments for keeping berakhos we can&#039;t relate to in the book.


Besides, I thought the point of the siddur is to teach us what to aspire to relate to, not &quot;just&quot; list how to express what I&#039;m thankful for.


On a second note, his proviso makes human motivation a boolean thing. Ever since the tree of knowledge, people decide to do things based on a mix of motivations. But let&#039;s say he meant that a woman may wear tallis or tefillin if her &lt;b&gt;primary&lt;/b&gt; intention is to do Hashem&#039;s will. Are most people capable of assessing for themselves how much of their motivation is from a positive place, and how much is self-serving? If this were true, the psychology industries would be far smaller. And advertising would become miniscule.]]></description>

But let&#8217;s say he meant that a woman may wear tallis or tefillin if her <b>primary</b> intention is to do Hashem&#8217;s will. Are most people capable of assessing for themselves how much of their motivation is from a positive place, and how much is self-serving? If this were true, the psychology industries would be far smaller. And advertising would become miniscule.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Check this Shelo &#039;Asani Isha - the Status of Women in Tora Judaism WRITTEN BY HARAV 
WEDNESDAY, 26 JANUARY 2011 12:32
In his book On Changes in Jewish Liturgy: Options and Limitations, HaRav Professor Daniel Sperber reviews some of the criticism levelled against the blessing recited by men thanking Hashem &quot;for not creating me a woman&quot; (Shelo &#039;Asani Isha). 

While agreeing that such a debate is legitimate, HaRav David Bar-Hayim demonstrates that many of the arguments often adduced in support of those who would have the b&#039;rakha expunged from sidurim (prayer books) are not. 

The Rav states that the issue needs to be addressed head-on, with intellectual honesty and rigour, not with disingenuous and apologetic claims. Tora Jews must be sincere, open-minded and willing to consider changing realities. That being said, the view that the b&#039;rakha should be dropped must be rooted in a Tora-based imperative. Tora Jews are loyal to the spirit of the Tora, not the spirit of the times.

Should a man thank Hashem for not creating him a woman if he doesn&#039;t honestly feel grateful for this fact? The Rav answers in the negative. A b&#039;rakha uttered without sincere kawana is of no value.

Can a woman who wishes to wear a tallith or tefillin do so? The Rav answers in the affirmative, with one proviso: that her intention be to do Hashem&#039;s will, not to make a point. A Jew performs a Misswa because it is Hashem&#039;s Will; any other motivation is unacceptable.

		<description><![CDATA[What about the fact that R&#039; Meir would have violated mesayeia lidvar aveira according to Rashi&#039;s version of the events?

Second, if we&#039;re trusting Rashi over an earlier source about the events in question, then trust Rashi that &quot;shelo asani ishah&quot; is thanking G-d for getting more chiyuvim.

It should also be noted that while the version of the three berakhos that we adopted is not R&#039; Meir&#039;s in the Bavli. Ours is Rabbi Yehudah&#039;s berakhos as per the Yerushalmi (&lt;a href=&quot;http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%99_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%93%D7%A3_%D7%A1%D7%92_%D7%91&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Berakhos 9:1, vilna 63b&lt;/a&gt;). And Rashi&#039;s source for saying it&#039;s about the number of berakhos is the very same quote!

The Torah Temimah is saying they&#039;re really two girsa&#039;os describing one shitah, but then it&#039;s R&#039; Meir who said &quot;she&#039;ein ha&#039;ishah metzuvah al hamitzvos&quot;, leaving him no room for theorizing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,

This is the way I understand Rabi Meir and his Mehalech.

The Gemara in Eiruvin (13b) seems to indicate that Rabi Meir was unmatched in his abilities. However, the Halacha generally does NOT accord with him because his colleagues could not understand him.

(I think that when you say the Halacha is like him, you are referring to when he is quoted anonymously - Stam Mishna, so that R. Yehudah HaNasi could establish the Halacha like him in those specific cases as the widely held view).

The world has 2 extremes when dealing interpersonally - truth and sensitivity (Shalom, if you will). &quot;Does this make me look fat?&quot;, or as Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel argue, do we say &quot;Kallah Naeh Vachasudah&quot; or &quot;Kallah K&#039;mos Shehee&quot;? When you deal with the esoteric and philosophical, you talk more to the deep truth that is there, while when you are giving Chizuk to a person, it&#039;s not the proper time to give the dose of truth, but rather sensitivity and understanding.

When we relate to the world, us human beings do so with different mixtures of looking at the &quot;real&quot; world and looking at the deeper world. Halacha is decided as to what the proper Mehalech is in order to traverse the world in the way that is most enriching. R. Meir and Rashbi saw a much deeper truth in the world. Not to say that the other Tannaim were incorrect - it is all part of the truth of Torah. The question of the Halacha is what is the practical balance that needs to be struck here. R. Meir and Rashbi&#039;s approaches were too far out to be sustainable for the community (See Brachos 35b - Harbeh Asu KRashbi Vlo alsa biyadam).

To me it seems that in the story of Rabi Meir he was trying to prove a point to Bruriah. Unwittingly, the truth of the &quot;win&quot; came at the cost of Bruriah&#039;s self respect. As far as the Bracha of Shelo Asani Isha, going with the version that indeed it is R. Meir who is the source, it is not a sense of pettiness or an issue with women that prompted it - Chazal specifically distanced themselves from allowing that into the Tefillah, as evidenced from the fact that Shmuel HaKattan was the one to formulate the Bracha of the Minim in the Amidah. As was pointed out by Micha Berger, the Bracha would not have been accepted by his colleagues if it was a merely a bias that wasn&#039;t shared by them.

As to R. Meir&#039;s position on Bakol: see the Ramban who also grappled with this and answers that the Bracha of not having a daughter was the fact that Avraham did not have to deal with the absence of Shidduch prospects at the time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I gave my basis... The name Beruriah is accepted among girls&#039; names, and in fact in some communities rabbanim made a point of using the name so as to untarnish Rebbetzin Meir&#039;s reputation.

As for what people teach and explain today... People today do not invest enough time on machashavah to bother looking beyond Rashi. That doesn&#039;t mean baalei machashavah did side with Rashi on this in any numbers. E.g. R&#039; Hutner is among those who named their daughter after Beruriah. (We can agree he was one of 20th cent Orthodoxy&#039;s more philosophical rabbis?)

Other examples of this reliance on Rashi rather than learning the whole sugya when it comes to aggadita: Insisting Rivqa was a 3 year old who could draw water for people and camels; the notion that the avos kept all the mitzvos, even as our rabbis would later rule and legislate, etc... We often hear &quot;everyone&quot; today repeat the opinion Rashi offers when it&#039;s not the only opinion in Chazal, nor the majority opinion amongst rishonim and earlier acharonim.

Side-note about R&#039; Nissim Gaon&#039;s story... Beruriah&#039;s father was indeed killed by the Romans according to Rashi&#039;s source as well. She was the daughter of R&#039; Chanania ben Teradion, one of the 10 Harugei Malkhus.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[According to Rashi&#039;s version of why R&#039; Meir left Bavel, he would have been guilty of being mesayeia two people lidvar aveirah, and those two people of adultery. We can&#039;t suspend judgment and say that chazal is telling us not to trust our ethical instinct because the story as told has all the major characters violating halakhah as well.



It&#039;s a case of the mesayeia lidvar aveira, not lifnei iver, but the basic point was already made by a very angry G*3.

		<description><![CDATA[I think you mean &quot;Beis Hillel&quot; and &quot;Beish Shammai&quot; -- Hillel and Shammai themselves rarely debated. The talmud discusses the generation break between the teachers and their schools. So any apparent difference in their approaches wouldn&#039;t explain the split in halachic perspective of the students.



Hillel was the nasi, it was his job to make things happen for people. Shammai was the av beis din, it was his job to represent cold hard law. The answers they gave the people who came for conversion has nothing to do with which was more petty, but each doing what was appropriate for their job.

But what you say isn&#039;t true of Beis Shammai either... They once forced, probably with literal threats of violence, a vote to end some contentious points of dispute and kept going even after their position lost one vote after another. They placed the resolution of halachic disputes that were splitting the people ahead of winning.]]></description>

So any apparent difference in their approaches wouldn&#8217;t explain the split in halachic perspective of the students.</p>
<p>Hillel was the nasi, it was his job to make things happen for people. Shammai was the av beis din, it was his job to represent cold hard law. The answers they gave the people who came for conversion has nothing to do with which was more petty, but each doing what was appropriate for their job.</p>
<p>But what you say isn&#8217;t true of Beis Shammai either&#8230; They once forced, probably with literal threats of violence, a vote to end some contentious points of dispute and kept going even after their position lost one vote after another. They placed the resolution of halachic disputes that were splitting the people ahead of winning.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;If you think the gemara is the product of people as petty as we are, Orthodox halachic methodology lacks validation.&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;m not sure what you mean by this. The Rabbis in the gemara were people, and among people, some are less petty (for example, Hillel), and some are more petty (for example, Shammai). Daf Yomi just a week or two ago has 3 people strongly criticizing Shammai for what could be considered pettiness while praising Hillel for tolerance.

What does &quot;lacks validation&quot; mean? Are you saying that a system of laws set up by someone who is petty is less valid than one set up by someone who is less petty? What if the more petty person has better training and knowledge in the creation of that aspect of law?

&lt;i&gt;If you lack that emunas chakhamim&lt;/i&gt;



I guess it all depends on how you define &quot;emunas chachamim&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the misunderstanding was mutual. I&#039;m saying that someone who doesn&#039;t believe that chazal are more likely to get halakhah right and to eliminate petty concerns from the halahic process than we are has little emotional or philosophical motivation to stay within classical / Orthodox halachic process and its conclusions.

So either the implication here is G-d hates women just as much as R&#039; Meir did or R&#039; Meir created this bracha as a way to express his anger at his wife.

A position shared by the Ramban, the Maharasha, Maharal, R&#039; Hirsch, R&#039; Yisrael Salanter, etc... but the Rambam goes so far as to ridicule literalists. The question would then be how people felt it was okay to teach a lesson using such a story. Not a question on Rav Meir, but on Rashi&#039;s sources.
