		<description><![CDATA[Not vaccinating is an act of pure selfishness. The only thing that allows a small of parents to &quot;choose&quot; not to vaccinate their children is the fact that the rest of do.  It&#039;s called &quot;herd immunity&quot;. You do not need 100% vaccination in order to eliminate the target disease from the population.  In communities where the level of vaccinations drops below a certain point, the entire community becomes susceptible to the disease. (This is because no vaccine is 100% effective.)

Those who &quot;choose&quot; not to vaccinate their children (there some children that can&#039;t be vaccinated) should be quarantined to special neighborhoods or islands where nature (and Darwin) can take its course.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s the cups. Let me explain: Anyone that has spent time in yeshivish circles knows a scary majority of those leaving the bathroom in a shul, bais medrash... leave the bathroom without washing their hands only to use the sink in the hallway outside. Soap is never used prior to touching (the petri dish of) said cup. 

The study should begin with the cups, but I wager this is too an incredulous a concept for most of the civilized world to swallow.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Before my father left for law school, he spent a year studying epidemiology in Columbia U. His mentor in this field was a fellow who had published a study on why Jews tend to die more on Saturday that any other day of the week. I haven&#039;t seen the statistics he worked with so I cant defend his premise. 


Anyway, these sorts of studies arent anti semitic of course, like you&#039;ve written, they are done by professionals hoping to help make a difference or are just interested in the science of it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s a general issue of living in crowded conditions.  Those communities have large families crowded into small homes.  The yeshivas are packed like sardine cans.  One cousin explained to me that his space in the Lakewood Bais Medrash is about the size of subway seat.  And they spend hours a day like that indoors.

But I&#039;m not sure that hypothesis holds in Monsey as well.  They sprawl out there more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How often do children come across &quot;exchange&quot; students from another country where they may have been exposed to mumps? Almost never. But at the yeshiva, there were students from various places visiting on a regular basis (and entering the beis medrash where &quot;everyone&quot; is located most of the day - one person catches it and then spreads it to others in close proximity).


Better question - why haven&#039;t there been outbreaks at colleges in areas of low vaccination? Maybe the answer is that colleges are diverse and have people from everywhere, so not concentrated by locality (like SF, the capital of vaccination refusers).]]></description>
