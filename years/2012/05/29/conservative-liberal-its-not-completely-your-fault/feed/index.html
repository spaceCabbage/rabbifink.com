		<description><![CDATA[It would certainly be smart of the right wing orthodox to not negate the left wing if we are talking numbers, just like it&#039;s smart for the Republican party to include those who for example agree with them 60% of the time or more. 

But here is the difference. Political parties need to win popularity contests; that&#039;s how they get elected. The right wing of orthodoxy doesn&#039;t care about quantity, they care about &quot;quality,&quot; and don&#039;t need to win elections. So what incentive would they have to accept the left wing or any other opinions as legitimate?]]></description>
