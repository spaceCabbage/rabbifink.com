		<description><![CDATA[just read this; great job pinpointing the issue in an honest way, but i fear that it gets really hard to follow some of the illogical hokus pokus (yet officially binding) halachos once someone gets to the state of malaise you refer to. i think someone needs to get up and defrag the hard drive for our current generation, possibly on a broader scale than what has been done many times in our history (changes by Josiah, Hillel, Chasidism, R Hirsch). wash your hands well with soap before hamotze and after using the restroom, etc. as an officially religious jew, i still try to keep all these rules, but i&#039;m definitely more lax about them. why can&#039;t someone get up with some cajones and close the breach. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A fulfilling life is an extension of desire, a disappointing life of expectation.  Either way, I am suspicious of the question.  If Jews a thousand years ago did not think in terms of spiritual fulfillment or religious disappointment, their lives were no less circumscribed by desire.  What they lacked was opportunity.  Opportunity is the burden modernity has conferred on Orthodoxy and those Jews searching for a deeper religious experience should be cautious about seeking the cure for their malaise from the source of their problem.  What the contemporary Jew needs is not to be more modern but to be more Medieval.  Have you hugged a Chassid today?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When those feelings have serious implications for a person&#039;s actions, they are definitely to be taken into consideration. Hesitation in giving permission to violate Shabbos in such situations is due to a tremendous misunderstanding - certain psychological conditions can&#039;t just be attributed to the &quot;yetzer hora,&quot; to be fought off with simple mental effort.

Concerning the bigger issue you&#039;re raising, I won&#039;t pretend to have an answer for you - it&#039;s a tough problem to have, and I wish you only the best in making your life work out in the best way possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks E :) You were very sensitive. However, I&#039;ve been told time and time again that feelings are not a legitimate reason to break shabbos. Even if in some fantasy world I would get a heter I&#039;m still in a situation where I have to lie to my kids, friends, etc. 
I guess the point I was trying to make is that if you are a skeptic, and you have to take a gamble by choosing between an orthodox and non-orthodox life, it really all comes down to: Is the lifestyle working for you? THAT, in my opinion, skeptic or not actually, is the simple reason why people are &quot;at risk.&quot; Sometimes as much as someone tries, it&#039;s just not working for them. If its not, why would someone choose living a double life over an honest non-orthodox life?

		<description><![CDATA[I would argue that in your situation, you would have had a pretty solid halachic argument for being allowed to watch TV on Shabbos - serious threats to life, including those which are psychological in nature, trump the Shabbos laws, certainly if what you needed could be accomplished with little to no compromise on the more serious rules.

I don&#039;t know about Sharia law, but the body of rabbinic halachah absolutely takes these serious issues into account - anyone who told you otherwise is simply wrong.

I imagine (as you said) that this is just one among many examples of your concerns. My apologies if this sounds insensitive in any way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You raise some good points. I would suggest reading Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits (REB) (especially God, Man and History and Not in Heaven for a fresh view of a Jewish philosophy that answers well to the need for an updated, while still faithful, Judaism (including Halachik issues with which REB concerned himself deeply).

&#062;In those days, it was stupid to not see God in everything. But in our modern times, where we have answers to many questions, we have reasonable explanations for many things that were mysterious in the past, where we know that superstition is bunk, all that seems so distant, so impossible, and so different from our world.

RYBS and REB would not agree with this. Philosophically, science does not answer the same questions as faith, and while in the past people created mythologies to explain natural phenomena, that is not to be confused with religion. In fact, mythology was steadily replaced by science even by Plato. The explanations offered by medieval theories gave intermediary explanations that led back to God, but the same type of divine cause is still possible and (arguably) needed using scientific explanations. It would be wrong for a teacher to tell students that because we understand the biological and chemical processes of photosynthesis, we therefore and by virtue of that understanding are able to lay claim to the cause of this process. Science, similar in this to mythological accounts, can explain how but not the why or the who, the cosmological cause, of the process. Understanding a process scientifically does not mean we do not see God in them.

&#062;Halachic Man and the Making of Ethical Man. In those books (which I have not read in full, only excerpts and reviews) 

These are valuable books to be read in their own right, and not to develop an impression from second- or third-hand sources. The Rav was not an easy mark, and it is not possible to encapsulate his world-view in one or two sentences (no matter how pithy). For example, reading Emergence of Ethical Man, it may be possible (as Hazony has done) to glean from that a break with traditional sources. However, seeing this as a denial of transcendence, miracles or mystical telos does not, in my opinion, do the book, or the Rav, justice. The book itself has elements which deny an explanation derived solely from naturalistic sources (see the footnote on page 101 for an example). The Rav, even more so, must be read in light of all his works, and certainly with more weight given to books he published while alive. Halachik Man, Halachik Mind and Lonely Man of Faith present a far more explicitly nuanced view of mankind.  Works in which a religious, metaphysical and transcendent aspect to man&#039;s existence cannot be discounted merely because Emergence does not focus on these.

That being said, I do not deny that RYBS was innovative. However, this innovation must be articulated correctly, not by projecting a &quot;naturalistic-only&quot; view on the Rav.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well said, Rabbi Fink!

As a woman of a certain age, i.e., older than you are, I would not pretend to know what it is like to face the world as it is now as a young Orthodox Jew.  I haven&#039;t ever had a problem reconciling the old world Judaism of open miracles with the modern world.That being said, I have experienced the &#039;let down&#039; from being a young adult frum woman to a woman &quot;living in her car&quot; as she drove numerous car pools across miles of urban landscape in unending traffic.  Modern life absolutely distracts from being able to engage in the aspects of frumkeit that used to give me that &#039;wow&#039; feeling or that &#039;aha&#039; moment.When I found myself  &quot;phoning it in&quot; regarding my involvement in my Jewish life I began to wonder if I could ever get back to feeling passionate about being Jewish. The challenge for me is that the re-telling of the stories of the open miracles are what inspire me.  It has become more difficult to find modern-day connections to these types of events.  However, it is not impossible.What I had to do is re-arrange my priorities to include MORE TIME to learn, to contemplate and to daven.  I&#039;ve had to stop rushing through davening and squeezing in learning after checking emails.  And since tehillim speak to me as a way to connect with what inspires me about being Jewish, I am taking more time to not only recite them, but to contemplate them and to learn about them.Admittedly, there was no time to be able to re-arrange my priorities until my children no longer required a driver.  Perhaps I could have made the changes sooner if we would have all agreed to eat raw foods for Shabbos! Seriously though, I encourage everyone who is wanting to feel more passionate about their religious practice to follow Rabbi Fink&#039;s suggestions. Find what speaks to you, carve out more time in your life and focus there.  The deeper I dig in the areas that appeal to me, the more I am feeling frumkeit&#039;s relevance to my life again.]]></description>

Why not address this? Well, two reasons. First, plenty of people do indeed do this. They don&#039;t follow any particular precepts of religion, and are good, happy, kind, and wonderful people. Second, that wasn&#039;t the point. The point is how can we &lt;i&gt;continue&lt;/i&gt; to be orthodox, yet evolve our orthodoxy such that it can coexist with the modern world (the only world that we have).]]></description>

But putting that aside, he was talking about a solution that sees modern ways of thinking as part of the solution and incorporates it into Judaism. That&#039;s already being done. If this floats your boat, read Chief Rabbi Sacks and a whole host of LW Orthodox rabbis (lav davka &#039;official&#039; LW Orthodoxy, whatever that is). LW Orthodox Judaism already does what Rabbi Fink says it the solution.

As for the idea that the yeshivish are soulful, that will be contested by pretty much anyone, including many yeshivish people, who themselves gravitate toward Chassidishe events for the soul. I never heard of anyone inspired by singing and dancing at - your example - Chaim Berlin. Soul? Are you sure? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice essay Rabbi. 

I just have one problem I cannot shake, it is bugging me to no end. The photo of the &quot;future&quot; sign you have is pointing North-East, when we all know based on Chazal and the Torah, that the correct direction is always dead right, or EAST as it relates to this photo. 

Please for the sake of Torah and Yidishkeit, fix the photo.

		<description><![CDATA[I think that part of the problem *is* the idea that HaShem&#039;s intervention is manifested in supernatural miracles. By not appreciating the amazing things in our daily lives, we cut ourselves off from our creator. Does the fact that we know exactly how it developed make the birth of a child any less miraculous? Can anyone upon visiting an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and hearing the recovering alcoholics express thanks to God for keeping them sober remain a skeptic? Should we when we look at a beautiful mountain range or rainbow appreciate its Creator as well as its beauty? 


But I don&#039;t hear a lot about this in Orthodox Judaism. I have a religious Muslim student from Libya in one of my classes. Yesterday afternoon she gave a presentation and she thanked Allah and her husband for making her success in graduate school possible. Do we really understand that God is the source of all our success in the world? Of all our material prosperity? I rarely hear such talk from Jews, Orthodox or not. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,

You talked about throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  I have a question for you.  I can understand how a skeptic can continue to be happily orthodox if it adds good to their life.  But, unless one is FFB and has some sort of emotional attachment to being frum, why on earth would a skeptic continue to be orthodox if a halachic way of life is making his or her life worse?  

I&#039;ll give you an example.  Not using electricity on shabbos has been very emotionally damaging to me.  Why?  Because I unfortunately experienced such a traumatic event that I develpoed post trauma stress disorder.  For the first six months after the event I would make healing progress during the week and then shabbos would not only undue that, but it intensified the PTSD and solidified it more.  With no distraction like TV I could not fall asleep, I could not call someone for support, and by the middle of shabbos I would already have fantasies of shooting myself in the head, which I did not do out of love for my children and parents.  As a skeptic, one day I decided that I only had one life to live and I wasn&#039;t going to spend one seventh of it in agony because of an opinion of a person who&#039;s opinion was based on others who got a lot of things wrong.  I started using electricity on shabbos and now I&#039;m not in suicidal agony every seven days.  However, now I have to live a doublr life which is horrible so I want out of the whole thing.   My husband, like you, acuses me of using errors in halacha and &quot;feelings&quot; to throw out the baby with the bathwater.  But he is not in my shoes and neither are you.  As far as I can tell, for you, an orthodox life has turned out to be beautiful.

So let me get back to my original question which I am looking for a sincere answer to.  If rabbinical halacha is no more provable than sharia law, why on earth would someone who knows this AND is being hurt by halacha NOT throw out the baby with the bathwater?]]></description>

Here is what KP said:

That lack of connection is reflected most dramatically in the growing numbers of so-called “adults at risk,” i.e., those who, at some point in adulthood, realize that they do not know why they have been performing mitzvos all their lives, or why they should continue to do so. Among younger people, the symbol of that lack of connection has become teenagers who text on Shabbos.&quot;
