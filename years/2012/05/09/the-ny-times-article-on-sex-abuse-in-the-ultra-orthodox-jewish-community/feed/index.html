		<description><![CDATA[Nowadays, unfortunately, claiming abuse has become an extremely effective weapon, and is in the hands of 11-year olds and their sympathetic moms. I know a rebbe who suggested to the parents of a rich brat that he needs remedial tutoring, and guess what. The kid claimed abuse, the principal told the rebbe he has no choice because the kid&#039;s family is the mainstay of the school, and he was kicked out. The kid was boasting about it to his friends, that&#039;s how the principal knew it was not true. Today any kid knows that the easiest way to get even with a rebbe who didn&#039;t put up with his crap, is to claim abuse, and in today&#039;s idiot court system, a 11-year old&#039;s word carries as much weight, or more, than a grown person with an impeccable track record of 40 plus years. PS, this kid was just recently arrested for stealing a car and drug possession.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fair enough, but that&#039;s why you cant presume that other police departments act the same way - they don&#039;t.  And while I havn&#039;t been to LA, my experience with Law enforcement (almost daily now for 20 years) is that I believe nothing they say, EVER, particularly when they are presented at community events.  Bottom line is, we all need to be vigilant about these issues.  We should not assume that Rabbonim or police will act appropriately. That is why we need to educate and protect our children.  (I guess the fact that last week they charged a lieutennant in the Baltimore police Department with dealing drugs out of the Police Dept parking lot clouds my judgemnet)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been to several conferences and community meetings on sex abuse. The police (from the LAPD) that presented at these events all assured the audience that allegations by a purported victim do not automatically result in an arrest. All claims are investigated.

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry but that&#039;s an easy one....Sex crimes detectives do NOT investigate, they accuse and charge. That&#039;s their job. They trust that the system will determine guilt or innocence.  ANY person, rabbi or otherwise, is better equipped to determine whether there is enough to charge a person with a serious crime than the police.  Obviously, if there is reason to believe the accusation is credible, charges need to be brought.  I have seen false allegations leveled at good people on  numerous occasions - where the alleged victim later admitted they were false.  Their motives have included, child support, divorce leverage, justification for their own criminal behavior or failures.  Don&#039;t get me wrong, I think if a parent, teacher or rabbi is complicit with hiding legitimate allegations they should answer for their complicity, but the Police?  The ONLY difference between the police and the criminals is that the police have badges.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more.   But my particular soap box requires me to take issue with one of your pretexts.  The police are totally ill equipped to deal with determining credibility.  There is very much a view that it is their job to arrest and charge and let the system figure out who is telling the truth.  In addition their are many members of the police who relish the thought of sullying Orthodox Jews at every opportunity.   Finally, while some Rabbi&#039;s may discourage reporting, that means we need better Rabbinical training, not to lose faith in the Title. Indeed, unqualified rabbi&#039;s or those with their own agenda threaten everything we believe in from kashrus to marriage.  That does not mean we should rely on the State to regulate Kashrus.  It means we need to be very careful of which rabbi&#039;s we show such deference to.  Dovid]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice essay.

It&#039;s not surprising to me that they blame the victim. It&#039;s taught from grade 1. Why was the beis hamikdash destroyed? Not because of evil enemies. Rather because we deserved it. 

We&#039;ve all heard people explain why the holocaust happened too. We must have done something wrong. Not enough learning torah? Modernity? Only waiting 5 hours after meat?

It&#039;s a psychologically messed up way of looking at our history and it&#039;s made it&#039;s way into people&#039;s daily lives.

		<description><![CDATA[From the article - &lt;i&gt;Rabbinic authorities “recommend you speak it over with a rabbi before coming to any definitive conclusion in your own mind,” Rabbi Zweibel said.&lt;/i&gt;

This, to me, is one of the worst parts of the whole mindset. It [more than] implies that &quot;thinking&quot; is not permissible before speaking to a Rabbi. That&#039;s not Judaism and I want nothing at all to do with such a warped system. They are becoming a new religion right before our eyes, just like the early Christians did about 2000 years ago. I have to admit that it&#039;s a little bit fascinating to watch it in action, but I fear that the actual schism will be rather wrenching. And I fervently hope that they won&#039;t attempt to slaughter us (the Jews) someday as every other breakaway religion throughout history has eventually done.]]></description>
