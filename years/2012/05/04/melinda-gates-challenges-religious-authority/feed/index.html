		<description><![CDATA[How do you know what was in Mordichi Kaplan&#039;s heart? 

The question is not her private relationship with God but her public actions and pronouncements.  Orthodox Jews and orthodox Christians conform to certain basic doctrines and principles.  Ms. Gates is in opposition to all the basic tenets of the Catholic Church.  She was married by a university provost and is not providing a Catholic education for her children.  Her charitable givings do not support Catholic institutions and like most religious liberals, understands doubt and non-conformity to be strong evidence of an abiding faith.   How does she differ from a Reconstructionist Jew?  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Once upon a time people were religiously honest.  Henry VIII couldn&#039;t get the Church to allow divorce so he created his own religion which conveniently did allow it.  Nowadays he&#039;d remain Catholic but demand that the Pope change the laws to make him happy.
Melinda Gates is allowed to have any opinion she wants but if Catholic doctrine says you do what the Pope says and that birth control is a sin then if she wants to be a good Catholic she needs to accept that.  If she doesn&#039;t let her become Episcopalian or Unitarian or something else.  She wants it both ways.
The &quot;I want to be a good &#039;x&#039; but I want &#039;x&#039; to change the rules to fit with my values instead of vice verse&quot; is what&#039;s offensive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll have to peek at that article, but my initial thoughts: When a religion has a self-proclaimed law or authority that is allegedly unassailable, can one publicly act in defiance of such an authority while still claiming to be a practicing member of the religion? (cf. homosexuals having an Orthodox Jewish wedding; Catholics advocating for birth control; etc.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it would be fair to say as follows, in regard to the &quot;Catholic scholar&quot; matter:

Mrs. Gates says that in the tradition of the Catholic scholars, the nuns at her Catholic school pressed on issues of social justice, including the idea of whether birth control is appropriate (permissible). In truth I suspect that the nuns probably raised this question as part of their didactic program and eventually answered this question by saying that it is not permissible; Mrs. Gates may have reached a different conclusion for herself. The idea of Catholic nuns preaching birth control seems unlikely to me, although it would be cracking if they did.]]></description>

In the actual speech at TEDx, she explains that when she was in Catholic school, the nuns gave their instruction in the tradition of the Catholic scholars, and that this instruction included the idea of questioning whether birth control is appropriate, among other things.

Well, I was trying to put this as a reply to your other comment, but I guess Disqus has a few bugs to work out. The message is the same.]]></description>
