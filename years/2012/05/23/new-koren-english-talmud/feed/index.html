Mike 


here is some points:


 Please help us  understand  how is it that  Rabbi Moshe Feinstein gave on 3 (  or maybe 4) different  occasions  a &quot;Haskomos&quot; for  Rav Steinsaltz


why  Harav Mordechai Eliyahu and many others
gave their Haskamot?


(http://www.korenpub.com/EN/tal-haskamot.htm)


 and  Please help us  understand why  Harav Shlomo
Zalman Auerbach refused to sign the Chērem?


 Or in short way only Lubacivth haters joined in?


Explain us way the Chērem was issued conveniently 20 years
after the appearance of the first tractate of Rabbi Steinsaltz?  less than 3 years before the English Talmud of
artscorll?

Rabbi Fink, 



First, thank you for your thought-provoking essays. 



I find it surprising that you and the many other reviewers completely fail
to mention that this is the second attempt to present the Steinsaltz Talmud to
the English-speaking public. The first effort, backed by the marketing muscle
of publishing powerhouse Random House. The work was a dismal failure, despite
many strong efforts to promote it for a number of years. 



As for the rest of your observations, the Steinsaltz Talmud was not banned
because it failed to adhere to the “tzuras hadaf&quot; (the Vilna page
layout), though that was one reason it was not widely accepted in the classic
yeshivos.



A far more fundamental reason was, as Leon Wieseltier put it in a 1989 New
York Times review (http://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/17/books/unlocking-the-rabbis-secrets.html?scp=1&#038;sq=leon%20wieseltier%20secrets&#038;st=cse),
the Steinsaltz Talmud is for &quot;studying,&quot; not &quot;learning.&quot;
The Steinsaltz treatment is informative, but if fails to give you the true experience
of being engrossed in the gemara. 



The ban on Rabbi Steinsaltz was related to another issue, one touched upon very
directly by the promotional video clip.



The ban was based on Rabbi Steinsaltz, throughout his works, failing to
treat the heroes of Scripture and Talmud with respect and reverence. 



Placed in that context, that video teaser isn’t merely ridiculous, it is a
reflection of a weltanschauung that should give people serious about religion
and religious traditions serious pause.

While I like the idea of keeping the tzuras hadaf, Steinzaltz wasn&#039;t the firs to change it, and there was no reason to take issue with it. Don&#039;t like it?

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty sure the Romm family did not invent that tzuras hadaf . I&#039;ve seen copies of the Talmud from before them with the same layout. They may have finalized and touched up the layout, and perhaps organized the commentaries on the side a bit, but the Gemara, Rashi, and Tosafos were already set up.

Of course, it&#039;s not holy. But it&#039;s a standard, and breaking standards is messy business. If I were a Talmud teacher, I would not allow my students to use a non-standard layout. There are so many commentaries that reference page numbers, and so much reliance on the pagination in general.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Vilna pagination is maintained in all editions of Steinsaltz gemara -- there are simply 2 page faces for each amud. The daf and amud is clearly indicated in the page heading. 

The Vilna layout is not preserved, but I have yet to see a specific written reference to page position (&quot;Gitten 55a, four lines after the wide lines, 2nd word&quot;).

All of this is moot, since Steinsaltz is shunned (more so than banned) in the Yeshiva world due to his hashkafa/politics, not his textual layout.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does this new English-version of the Talmud provide significant commentary, other than just translating the text? My experience with the Hebrew Shteinzalz was that for the most part, all he did was translate the Aramaic to Hebrew. He didn&#039;t add background or explanations to help understand pshat. As such, it was close to useless for someone who could &#039;make a leining&#039; but sometimes needed help understanding things.

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Rabbi Fink,

I was fortunate enough to receive and examine a copy of the Koren already. I hope you will take a look at my review which I combined with a retrospective on the recent history of Talmud translations, etc. I wonder if it resonates with you: http://vesomsechel.blogspot.com/2012/05/new-koren-edition-of-talmud-bavli.html

Best Regards,

Rabbi Joshua Maroof]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe that&#039;s a good rule, but people objected to the  original Steinsaltz as if tzurat hadaf was (literally) min hashamayim, when that couldn&#039;t be further from the truth.

		<description><![CDATA[I was really annoyed when I saw the video - it was more &#039;A Dummy&#039;s Guide to the Babylonian Talmud&#039; than a preview of a serious academic work.  They cheated themselves (OTH the Artscroll clip was ridiculous for different reasons)

I&#039;ve seen the new/first volume in real life - it&#039;s a really amazing piece of work and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll collect all the volumes as they are printed.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;ll need the video to help sales....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;The experience of Talmud study, when done right,
I have always wanted to learn Talmud.....but right. I want to learn it with an emphasis of the time and place in which it was written. Historical context is key, but i have yet to find someone that can do it. Or least has time for me :P]]></description>
