		<description><![CDATA[Jewish or halachic socialism has either Rabbis or observant Jews acting as regulators.  How can we, then, extrapolate to secular regulators (especially regarding government agencies--unelected, politically appointed figures)? Giving secular goverment more power to regulate could in fact diminish the scope of Jewish social initiatives.  See also Al Armendariz, former EPA official, who likened EPA regulatory enforcement to imperial roman crucifixion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding your most recent comment: Yes, I agree fully that Chazal created a regulated commercial environment.  That&#039;s not Socialism!  My original point (which, I believe, is still valid) is that Chazal did little (anything?) to expand the scope of communal property or limit the right to personal property. In fact, as I stated earlier, with respect to that issue, Chazal did NOT expand it&#039;s impact at all.  Regarding Hasagat Gevul -- that has nothing to do with annexing private property so I don&#039;t understand why it&#039;s relevent (what did I miss)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[J Price,

Some of the restrictions DO apply outside E&quot;Y. For example, you can&#039;t open a new business too close to a similar existing business -- I am aware of three cases in New York in recent years where a new business was sanctioned by a beit din for unfairly affecting an existing business! And of course onaah, which you mention, is a huge restriction on the free market, applying everywhere. Some day I will have to learn how Jews can invest in limited liability corporations. Limited liability is something the Torah never heard of!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adam Smith was not an anti-government fanatic. In fact, he supported government roles in many areas:


Adam Smith has sometimes been caricatured as someone who saw no role for government in economic life. In fact, he believed that government had an important role to play. Like most modern believers in free markets, Smith believed that the government should enforce contracts and grant patents and copyrights to encourage inventions and new ideas. He also thought that the government should provide public works, such as roads and bridges, that, he assumed, would not be worthwhile for individuals to provide. Interestingly, though, he wanted the users of such public works to pay in proportion to their use.

One definite difference between Smith and most modern believers in free markets is that Smith favored retaliatory tariffs. Retaliation to bring down high tariff rates in other countries, he thought, would work. “The recovery of a great foreign market,” he wrote “will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.”

http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Smith.htmlIn addition, Smith had no problem in principle with the very generous Poor Laws that existed in the UK and America at that time. He did very strongly object to their provisions that restrained the geographic mobility of the poor. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The big one IMO is the system of tithing to support the poor and the priestly / levitical classes. Indeed the Shulchan Aruch states that the Beis Din can determine what a man is able to give and can administer lashings until he does. They can seize his possessions, and even hold his property as a guarantee of payment.

Nothing capitalistic about that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The reading I have done on Adam Smith suggested that he would oppose any governmental interference. You need to explain WHY the government should get involved. If markets are working properly a few people will get cheated by the bad guy and then the market will adjust and no one else will use his services. Why bother with stupid regulation?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find it interesting regarding &quot;authorities can take your property without compensation&quot;.  It&#039;s certainly true that principles such as hefker beit din hefker exist in halacha, my (ignorant?) sense is that these are used as mechanism for B&quot;D to run. Are there examples in the gemara when Chazal used it to just aprogate the normal rights of a property owner?  (My sense is that it is used by B&quot;D when they need to enforce another law...and it&#039;s just the mechanism, not the motivation, but I could be mistaken on fact here.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For some reason, I&#039;m not able to reply directly to what you wrote in reply to my earlier comment.
You wrote:
&quot;Adam Smith Lasseiz Faire economics relies on the market to correct itself. There is no need or place for governmental regulation in that model.&quot;

Capitalism relies upon a free market to correct itself with regard to pricing, not to correct for the ill-effects of criminal behavior. Because it is free, competition and other factors combine to generate the best price for a commodity or service (&quot;best&quot; being the price that most accurately represents the availability of that commodity relative to demand). The key is FREE market. Coercion, meaning any time I use force or the threat of force to deprive another person of the free control of his property, undermines the freedom of the market, and thereby reduces its ability to correct itself. All forms of criminal acquisition of property, including fraud and the failure to uphold a contract, are, at the core, forms of coercion (in that, without government, the only way for a victim of such a crime to gain possession of his property would be through force).

It is precisely for this purpose that government is necessary, according to ALL capitalist thinkers. Ayn Rand describes this in her essay, &quot;The Nature of Government.&quot; Adam Smith saw an even broader role for government, even within the parameters of a free economy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It isn&#039;t socialism, because there is nothing I&#039;ve seen in Chazal that suggests that the government should own most of the productive assets of society. But it nevertheless is a FAR more highly regulated economic system than anything we see anywhere in the world today. And much of what we take for granted in the modern world of business is not acceptable to the Torah. For example, there is no concept of limited liability, and the authorities can take your property without compensation. 

Ayn Rand was not a Torah Jew!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;based on their understanding of the Torah.&lt;/i&gt;

I disagree. It was based on their understanding of Torah &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; based on their circumstances, &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; based on the beliefs of their time, &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; based on their general psychology, &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; based on the science of their times, &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; based on the prevailing economics of their times, &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; based on a lot of other things. In short, they were human.

&lt;i&gt;the true Judeo-Christian view is capitalism.&lt;/i&gt;

The &quot;true&quot; Judaic/Christian code is neither capitalism nor socialism. The codes only specified laws relevant to their times (for example, the Church controlled quite a bit of property and political power for centuries, as did our Kohanim) in the context of those times.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am still reading the original article, but it&#039;s not clear to me why you think that it&#039;s true.  Fundamentally, halacha respects the individual&#039;s rights to his property and the individual is muchzak in his land.  It is specifically land which the gemera seems hell-bent on excluding from the regulations of commerce (see the exemption of onaah and possible ribis for karkah).  Not clear to me why you think this is (a) a minimum standard or (b) implies a want for communally held land.  On the contrary, allowing karkah to be essentially unregulated regarding pricing allows for monopolies within the real-estate sector (even during the times of the gemera and after, when the rules of shemitas karkah are effectively disbanded).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whether Chazal&#039;s law accepted or enforced en masse is irrelevant. They held these laws to be the best system of economics based on their understanding of the Torah. It was NOT just a religious code, it was also a civil code. 
And yes, as I said, this does not translate into 2012 economics. It does however, rebut the presumption of some, that the only moral code / the true Judeo-Christian view is capitalism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;It is up to the MARKETS to regulate themselves.
Is that something Ayn Rand would push for? Conservatives pro-capitalissts don&#039;t, specifically in the context of letting actual fraud being legal and non-regulated and let the marketplace sort it out. 

&gt;You haven&#039;t? I hear it all the time. Maybe I hang around with &quot;real-er&quot; conservatives...

I think perhaps you may be mistaken when conservatives say that subjective fairness should not be legislated vs saying that the market will alway decide what is moral. How does that even make sense. Is Ashley Madison moral? No, but there is a marketplace for it. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bear in mind that Chazal had moral authority, whereas governments and secular courts can only deal with laws. Although legislatures enact laws to enforce some degree of morality, judges should not be deciding what I can and cannot do based on their own values, which are likely to differ from mine (and from the Torah&#039;s). Yes, their interpretation of the law is based on their values, but this is a human weakness, whereas Chazal&#039;s ability to go beyond the letter of the law was a strength.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Well we all know where you lean ;-)&lt;/i&gt;

Really? I didn&#039;t assert any of my own opinions.

&lt;i&gt;This is an issue of fraud. How are capitalist/conservatives against actual fraud protection?&lt;/i&gt;

Caveat emptor means that the buyer must beware. If no one is careful then dishonest people will prosper. It is up to the MARKETS to regulate themselves.

&lt;i&gt;Also, as a conservative, I, personally have never heard the phrase that the marketplace will decide what is moral. &lt;/i&gt;
