		<description><![CDATA[Just wanted to share a somewhat related experience.  A colleague mentioned to me that he has always had good experiences when working with UI designers and coders who&#039;ve come from a background where they studied Gemara - because the way pages were/are laid out on the Internet are very similar to that of a page of Talmud.  (the base text with links to surrounding layers of commentaries, explanations, references, etc. - and jumps to different topics that would confound most people made sense to people used to studying)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BTW, this link shows part of the problem. The jskit link has no clear identifier regarding which DB blog post these comments are associated with. Just a code that matches up to a post buried somewhere inside jskit&#039;s database. I hope disqus has a better identifier!]]></description>
