		<description><![CDATA[You who wrote this response to Chaya\&#039;s article are obviously biased on the sheer basis of your your viewpoint.  Which is one that is assuming that these\&quot; freedoms\&quot; for women are actually objective freedoms.  Myself like Chaya were/are members of both worlds at one span of time and we both CAN speak objectively.  I would any day shave my head, follow halacha as observantly as this oppressive sexually and lustfilled world/culture will allow, have a rabbi check my underware 5 times a day, and I would  find it less repressive then this feministic culturally relative world-view which I am most confident from your point of view  I \&quot;ironically\&quot; find most oppressive.  You obviously speak from this viewpoint and it therefore  has no validity or purpose in response to her article.  Very best, Masha Chava.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. You are going off topic. We were discussing the relevance of Israeli Chareidim. Kiryas Joel has no relevance to our discussion of the relevance of Israeli Chareidim.
2 Yes. Until you mention something of factual evidence it is judt nasty inuendo. Anecdotal evidence leads me to strongly doubt your claims.
3. Again, you miss my point. Their choice to live in Israel (and generally they live in American communities) has little bearing on the nature of Chareidim in America. Their are thriving communities of baalei teshuvah, theri lifestyle also has little reflection on the lifestyle of those who are secular. 
You don&#039;t seem to be that great in understanding my points. please take your time to read my points so I don&#039;t have to waste time simply restating my original points. Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@yahoo-AU2EM44YN57KOZ3NNEYARQ7OAU:disqus &lt;i&gt;1. American Chareidim don&#039;t live that way. To lambast them for the lifestyle they don&#039;t live, because you believe they should live it is at best bizarre. As an aside your logic is flawed, their are different ideals for different circumstances.&lt;/i&gt;

You repeatedly ignore real-life examples. Kiryas Yoel is attempting to &quot;live that way&quot;. &quot;That way&quot; being self-imposed poverty and  heavy reliance on public welfare. And, yes, I do lambast self-imposed poverty and heavy reliance on welfare. For various reasons that I&#039;ve discussed previously.

&lt;i&gt;2. Really? where did you pick that one up?&lt;/i&gt;

It&#039;s a known fact, do you deny it?

&lt;i&gt;3. So? Some percentage of atheists, buhddists etc. &quot;*ARE* former [chareidi] Americans&quot;. So according to your logic, one should attack American Chareidim for their atheistic views.&lt;/i&gt;

What on earth are you talking about? There are thriving communities of American Charedim in Israel, and they are trying to &quot;break into&quot; Israeli Charedi society with limited success (they are generally perceived as &quot;too modern&quot; for full acceptance, but many second generation are slowly being accepted).]]></description>

So let me repeat myself in analogical style so you can understand. It is akin to a Muslim who claims Catholosicm is the true Chritianity. If you still don&#8217;t get it, I&#8217;m sorry.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Listen Rabbi, you&#039;re wrong okay. You&#039;re just wrong.
In the past couple weeks I have watched both Pearl Perry (part 1 at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO6PXoTO1bQ) and Deborah Feldman (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8bcbYf1k-k) rant in unsophisticated English about their most horrible experiences in the Hassidic community, now being able to broadcast them having scandalously left their respective communities. Both publicly embarrassed themselves (by expressing their ideas with slightly too much emotional fervour for national TV,  but let&#039;s even say they&#039;re free to make whatever impression they want of themselves...) as well as embarrassing Orthodox Jewry as a WHOLE!
Both misrepresented thousands and thousands of people, using their pain to generalise for hundreds of communities, to pin this somewhat &#039;evil&#039; description of frum Rabbis all around the world. As I watched, I cringed. I have friends in a variety of Hassidic communities and I tell you, poor Deborah and Pearl are the minority. Because they know nothing better? I admit this could be true in some cases, but hey, happiness is happiness.
When I read Chaya&#039;s article I breathed a sigh of relief. Finally, someone had the sense to write something GOOD about Jewish Orthodoxy. It was positive, it was forward, it was funny, it was everything people needed to hear. The comments were great - people asked questions about Judaism in interest, not in criticism, as some had in response to the above youtube videos). It was a success Rabbi, Orthodox Judaism got just a little bit of respect for a change.
You&#039;re saying she generalised? I&#039;m saying so many others have generalised about Orthodoxy for the worse, let her do it for the better! Let her speak for all those people, Chabad AND other Chassidim who are truly happy with their way of life.
I mean, you&#039;re a frum Rabbi, don&#039;t you want to be represented in a positive light? Why are you complaining?
And I mean, saying that Chaya is setting you back &#039;several decades&#039; in advocating for women&#039;s rights - really. How so? What so in order for us to succeed in creating more opportunities for women in insular Hassidic communities, you need the whole online community and the media to believe that Jewish women are oppressed and unhappy and in need of saving? You need an increase in antisemitism? Who are you kidding?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What about all those other ultra-orthodox women who are not as lucky as you are, and have to support their families in meaningless jobs (not everyone can be teachers) while their husbands sit and learn? Do they get showered with clothes and jewelery and get to watch their kids in the sun all day? I realize that most Hassidic men in NY are businessmen, but that is certainly not the case in Israel. I understand that many young women are educated in schools and seminaries to believe that working your fingers to the bone and never seeing your kids, and living in grinding poverty on a single minimum wage is a holy sacrifice for the Torah. 
Again, I think that Rav Fink is not denying the positive experiences of many chassidic and litvish women, he is simply taking issue with those individuals who use their positive experiences as a justification to deny or ignore real issues concerning women in the orthodox world. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ Oh, please. Do you mean to tell me that all women are more compassionate than all men? Have you never seen women with iron-clad wills, or a strong sense of justice? 
Women are successful court judges and it seems to work just as well for them as it does for male court judges. 
Applying an across-the-board generalization about what a particular race or sex is not only intellectually dishonest, it also denies the reality that  I am sure even you have seen with your own eyes. 
You need to understand that Talmudic generalizations of what a woman supposedly is was only relevant to those times, and is completely irrelevant and archaic in today&#039;s society. Women in the Talmudic area, with rare exceptions, were uneducated, so of course they were seen as &quot;weak minded&quot;. Intelligence, while it is genetically innate, can only become apparent when it is cultivated and nourished. And women&#039;s &quot;compassion&quot;, in the era of the Talmud, could easily be confused with &quot;submission&quot;. In a society where men were law makers and rulers of the household, it was only the men who had the authority to mete out punishment, and not the role of the woman. Just because she never had the authority of a &#039;punisher&#039;, that does not make her compassionate. 
On a lighter note, let&#039;s have a look at our lives today...for example, I remember that when I was growing up, I always knew that if I wanted something, I was more likely to get a &quot;yes&quot; from Dad, then from Mom, and by plenty of my childhood friends it was the same. A more extreme example, particularly in light of the frustrating bureaucracy in Israeli society: bursting into tears in front of a man to get what you want is more likely to work than bursting into tears in front of a woman. 
And did you not have/know female school-teachers and shule committee board members/ chessed society leaders that everyone, including men, are terrified of? 
Does it really seem like women are &quot;always&quot; more &quot;compassionate&quot; then men? 
In order to make things easier for orthodox women, even in a halachic context, the first thing we have to do away with is archaic stereotypes. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That article has no relevance to my point. I can agree whole heartedly with that article and my point stands. Personally, I view that concept in the Nietzschean sense of the struggle between Judaic and Roman ideals etc. My point, which you failed to answer, is that no matter how perfectly Jews follow Judaic principles there will be those who vehemently despise and disagree with our ideals. 
Your second question would again only apply to the box you chose to put me in. In my view your question is meaningless. Your question is also logically meaningless because I never proposed PR, I was responding to your statement of when PR is neccessary. And even those who view every Gentile as an antisemite (a view which I see no reason to take) as a fete accompli there is still room for PR. To put it simply without discussing the variables, I would prefer a person who calls me a dirty kike behind my back than one who send me to a gas chamber. Logic, my friend logic.
 
As an aside Rabbi Adlerstein commentary has no bearing if someone elses view is right or wrong. I find it preposterous that you would argue that a statement in gemara can not have a certaiin interpretation because some rabbi had another view.
 
Now please answer just one of my questions. You said &quot;If we fix our problems WE WON&#039;T NEED PR.&quot; If we fix our problems would you tell your gay friends that you stand by the torah which says it is an abomination, or would you PR your way out of it? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Philosophical viewpoints aren&#039;t curses, they are blessings.&quot; What a silly political correct thing to say. In the sense of extremity; Is eugenics a blessing? How about Nazism? Racism? Communism? I choose to respect individuals regardless of their viewpoints, but why should I differentiate Reform from Christianity. They both believe in the Divine Nature of the torah (possibly Christains more so) and believe that traditional Judaism does not apply anymore. Of course Christains, Muslim and Reform communities do great things, but there is no reason I should accept them as correct religious or philosophical viewpoints.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi, your judgemental essay does a disservice to the reader. Your judegement is based upon your personal perception of what makes people happy or sad, fullfilled or un fullfilled which initself is based on where you are today. I know many member and rabbi&#039;s of Chabad Lubavitch as well and members (men and women) of Satmir who are extremely happy with their personal status within their respective communities. I consider my as an Observant Jew as I am unable to observe some of the common laws. Because of where I live I must drive to shul which is and will remain my problem as I will not be moving in the foreseeable future. In addition I know that neither I nor my wife would not be happy in most  of the Chasidic communities, mostly because it was not part of our lives in the past. But, some of the members of the Satmir communities that we know, who did not grow up Satmir are very happy-one is even a convert. You speak of the women being kept back, how they dress, they can&#039;t vote, etc. which may be factual-depending on the community-but that is only a negative to you not to them. There are members of any community who are more or less happy than others. Arranged marriages may not be to your taste but the incidence of divorce is much lower-to which you&#039;ll argue they have no choice. As you know -Orthodox marriages are usually not arranged. Orthodox men and women date, learn about each other through talking, what they like , where they want to go in their lives and how they want to live those lives. They decide if they should marry and the parents have already checked the backgrounds and the families. They also make sure that they are in fact Jewish.  Chasdis came about to preserve the european ways of Jewish religious and social practice during the pograms. They exist to continue these ways. Chabad Lubavitch does more outreach  than any other Jewish group in the world. They don&#039;t try to make their students become anything other than than Jews who practice today more than they did yesterday. Rabbi, I could go on and on discussing what you&#039;ve written-but at the end it&#039;s still you judging others, which as Jews we should not be doing. Have a god Shabbos and a Great Yom Tov.   ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All those picking on exact wording.. citizens  or not citizen we all know the truth that women are deemed as being less then men in every aspect of life. What about them praising God every single day for not making them a woman.
Don&#039;t fool yourself, we all know why that Kj husband can afford to lavish her with jewels and she can afford to sit in the sun with her kids?!!!?!! Its because u guys are not that observant as you would like to portray yourself. Were you taught lying is a sin? Were you taught stealing is a sin? I&#039;m sure you were. So how can anyone take you seriously when you pick and choose what mitzvos you want or wont observe. In the real sense of the word you are off the derech. It doesn&#039;t matter if u look one way or another, you are swerving away from true religious observance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although I found the original article irritating, I take exception to your article as well.  I am a frum Jewish Woman and have been for over half a century.  Never have I felt like a second class citizen , quite the opposite as a matter of fact and I have relayed this phenomenon to my non Jewish counterparts countless times throughout my life.  The entire religion is carried through the centuries and really rests solely on our shoulders.  The whole question of who is a Jew is fully and completely determined through the maternal line, hence through a woman.  You are NOT a Jew if your mother was not a Jew and her mother before her, etc.  we don&#039;t recognize halves, quarters, eighths, etc.  we believe in wholes and completes and that is only determined by a woman.  That makes us women the most powerful and trusted species in the religion.

A man can have a hundred children but if not born to a jewish woman they are not Jewish.  Wow how powerful and important are we?  It matters not if the man is a king, a Rabbi,  the wealthiest man alive.  It truly levels the playing field.  Even if the mother is the lowliest servant on earth but is still a Jew, the child will be a Jew .  Wow how powerful is that?

Furthermore, you neglect to mention that only in cases where a true question is involved where neither the husband nor the wife can determine if the discharge on the underwear is a problem or not, does one have to consult a Rabbi.  Nor do you mention that the wife can also go to the Kallah teacher who might know the answer, nor do you mention how the whole thing is done in a very discrete manner where the Rav doesn&#039;t even need to know who is asking the question or who the item belongs to.  I find your article and your attitude very cynical and not helpful to the cause at all.  If ou are looking to help the plight and equality of women it would be best if you concentrate on real issues such as abuse and blackmail.  Also how the batei dinim do not treat women fairly and with compassion and basically allow men to walk away epwithout responsibility or accountability for their actions.  Please place fault and blame here it is due and not on the chassidus or on the religion or Halacha itself.  It is with those who interpret the Halacha for their means and purposes and not in th way the Halacha was intended ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[She goes to another Rabbi, that is what she does.  She finds herself a Rabbi or a Rebbetzin who will listen to understand. She needs to understand that it is true that it is extremely important to fight for one&#039;s marriage and family but it is also extremely important to understand how one needs to be respected and treated and if a spouse crosses the line and does not treat her according to the Torah and Halacha, and a Rabbi refuses to acknowledge that, find another Rabbi who does and who is well versed in Shalom Bayis issues.  Go back to your own Kallah teacher or call a Kallah teacher for help.  No where in the Torah or Halacha does it say that a husband has the right to abuse his wife or his children.   No where in your kesuba does it say that either.  No where in your chassidus is it condoned.  Just because a person crowns himself with the title of Rabbi does not mean that he is capable of dealing, handling or even understanding the intricacies of marriage and human nature, nor does it mean that he has the knowledge, compassion, warmth, kindness and generosity of spirit to lead a Kehilah .  One must be very careful in choosing their Rav and the Kehilah they join even within any particular chassidus.  And every Kallah teacher should teacher the warning signs of trouble brewing and when to go to a Rav and/or a therapist at the very first sign of trouble.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure why you draw that distinction. I mean, I can understand what you&#039;re saying, but I don&#039;t see why it&#039;s necessarily so.  Yes, we are all culturally restricted. I cannot do certain things because if I do, I will be ostracized. But there is very little that I can&#039;t do that someone else can except where there is some natural limitation such as my mental/physical capacity, age, height, etc. So how is the restriction on a black becoming a lawyer any different than the restriction on a woman becoming a chazzanit?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you have missed the point of Chaya&#039;s article; and while you make several valid - and *extremely* important - points, they are not in any way in conflict with anything Chaya wrote.  It is true that oppression, neglect and abuse occur in some communities - as they do everywhere; but as Chaya herself said, they do not represent the whole community.  More importantly, they do not represent TORAH.  She was describing the *system*, not the people in it.  People are flawed; the Torah is not.  Her description of her experience, b&#039;&#039;H, happens to be a wonderful reflection of what&#039;s *possible* if people look into the Torah truly and deeply - of the ideal.  Unfortunately, many women are not experiencing that ideal, whether because of the communities they are in or their individual situations; but it is not because the system is flawed, or because the possibility of that ideal doesn&#039;t exist. The people carrying out what they think is the correct interpretation of Torah are human, and therefore fallible.  But Hashem is neither.]]></description>
