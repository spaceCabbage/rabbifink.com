		<description><![CDATA[Noam, RSRH&#039;s Ausstrit was about not being under the same political and religious block as the Reformers. Being lumped together with them was putting a stranglehold on creating schools that were frum and would have limited the scope of the curriculum.

But my guess is you knew that and were just being coy.

Not funny.

TIDE means Torah guiding us in and making use of  the current world we live in. RSRH writes that the ghetto walls were imposed upon us by the outside world - not a l&#039;chatchilla at all. When they came down it provided us with the opportunity to bring Yiddishkeit back to what it always was.

Noam, Read more Hirsch. It&#039;s very relevant to our generation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just stumbled on this site and my mind is racing. Why do you hvae to be so negative. You have such power with your words. can you please do something constrcutive instead of DEstructive with them? Without going to the Asif a(obviously ) and without even reading much about it, I know that its something that I would feel uncomfortable supporting. While it was a very good idea, we live in complex times, there&#039;s no one answer that can be shouted from the rooftops. But what&#039;s the point of spitting venom? all you leave is nastiness in your wake. You want followers? Lead! Lead by example and by suggestions. I read the Dear Chaya article and it was the same thing - just negativity.
Reality is in perception. What reality are you in and what reality are you encouraging people to be in?

		<description><![CDATA[Your sentiments seem to very much in the majority.  Both of my sons who attended came home shaking their heads.  Classic case of false advertising.  For one thing, the Chassidim clearly monopolized this event, since they knew they could put fannies in the seats.  Had any of the Litvish Rosh Yeshivas spoken, it might have been a different spin.  Plus it would have been in English.  My sons&#039; Rosh Yeshiva was on the dais, he told the boys that he was quite confused about what transpired.

I agree, take that $1.5M+ and use it to help our yeshivas.  When all those Rebbes get their own Chassidim to filter their own devices, maybe I would have some respect.  But their own &quot;courts&quot; were sitting there texting, video posting etc., making a total mockery out of the entire event.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ By  Joseph  Aish-oleh


 


They came in droves


From far and near


They were not sure


What they would hear


 


The message,


Some say


Was not clear


Some with hope


And some with fear


 


They came from far


They came from wide


40,000


Packed inside


 


Did they succeed?


I know they tried


To say what they felt


Deep inside


 


Emotions most


They tried to hide


And some they laughed


While others cried


 


I go back home


Although quite tired


Half the night


In traffic mired


Yet I arrived


All pumped!


Inspired


 


I won’t look on the web


Or log


On to any shtus or
blog


 


I will set my filtration high


Nothing assur


Will get by


I promise that I’ll never read


Any email I don’t need


 


I won’t care if Obama


Was born in USA


Or if another gadol


Has just now passed away


 


I will not look at matzav


I care not who is sick!


You want to tell me something


You better call not click!


 


I’ll look not at the Nais


Or at Yeshiva World


I will not let the wrath get me


Those curses they unfurled


 


I do not care if Iran


Will drop the Atom Bomb


I will not send a picture


Even to my Mom!


 


I’ll throw out all the messages


I won’t respond at all


You want to tell me something


Come to my home or call!


 


Oh! Yes I was Mekabel


I’m starting just today


I’ll just look at my clients mail


For after all, they pay!


 


But now I sit


In agony


I now feel like a fool


An email just came from


My son’s Mesivta
 School!


Rosh Ha Yeshiva wrote me


Responding to my call


He does not leave a number


“Please email back!” That’s all!


 


I ponder this


And wonder and then


What do I see?


Another email 


That just came


Straight from BMG!


 


It’s graphic


And its pretty


Oh!  What a lovely
sight!


Click to sponsor learning


On Holy Shavuos night!


 


The emails is quite fancy


I thought it pretty slick


Imagine! Sponsor Torah!


“Just make a simple click!”


 


 


Alas, I just was nichshal!


My body racked with rage!


I just was oiver my neder


At BMG’s web page!


 


A standard set


For you and me


Should it not hold


For the marquee?


 


Am I allowed to ask


These things?


 


Can I express the feeling


Or will I just become a piece


Of glued on pashkeveilin?


 


 


Can I ask anyone 


Who sat 


Upon that dais high?


Did ever through a web site


An airline ticket buy?


 


And some of those


Who sat on high


Do any of them own?


A blackberry, an Android?


Even an iphone!


 


Again, I’m sure


It’s filtered


But I heard that’s assur too…


Is that standard for those men?


Or just for me and you?


 


And shuckling in harmony


To all that they did say


But I heard that many sitting there


Send e-mails every day!


 


I don’t mean to be 


Chutzpadik


I ask you please don’t lose it!


But, how could you go 


Assur it


When those Rabbanim use it?


 


Of course they do not


Click themselves


A shamas does the work


I do not 


Have that luxury


For I’m a simple jerk


 


I do not have a gabbai


To check technical details


Or medical directories


Not simple, silly sales


 


I ask you all


What do I do?


A simple yearning


Trying Jew?


 


Who wakes at five to learn a blatt


And goes to sleep at twelve


Who struggles for parnassah


And in shtus will not delve


 


Yet he knows not


Just how to cope


His mortgage overdue


And If he can not transfer cash


Foreclosure will ensue!


 


I tried to make a ticket


I must get to LA


I call American and wait…


And sit there half the day!


 


He just received a notice


The IRS says pay!


He has to send them cash, right now?


They want it now! Today!


 


Should i  do it in
the  business!


Sneak behind the boss


And check out your deductible


It’s his work and his loss?


 


His air conditioner just broke


The filter needs replacing


Its been two weeks 


He can’t get through


His wife gives him a lacing!


He says I’m calling them up now


What he hears is debasing


 


“Wait time is just an hour


But you can click on Sears 


I will not use the internet


He yells!


But no one really cares!


 


And then they say


If you don’t click


We can’t help you at


Unless you drive down over here


And come down to the mall


 


He tells his wife I’m leaving


I’m driving to the mall!


I’ll get that part we need


I’ll fix it after all


He gets into the car that nigh


And enters to the mall


What does he see


A bunch of bums


With, Drugs and alcohol?


 


My kid is wheezing


He is sick


One day, Overnight


Just click!


 


A medicine it does arrive


A formula keeps him alive


But lo it comes from


Arkansas


Should I click


And break your law?


 


I could give scenarios


I know of hundreds more


This is the curse of galus


A fog


And nothing’s klohr


 


A group of women


Who share pain


Of  children deemed
autistic


A Pittsburgh
man who has a boy


With Fibrosis called Cystic


 


May I get an article


To deal with Melanoma


Or finding the world’s expert


For someone in a coma?




I don’t mean to disparage


Or nullify those views


I have so many questions


Not answered by a shmuz


 


Of course we need the chizuk


But I’m old not a teen


I understand


How bad it is


It’s not a magazine


 


And every word of mussar


About the greatest test


Is worthy of a stadium


Packed 10 times at best!


 


We have some brilliant minds out there


And I have some ideas


Like learning mussar


Every day


Something that no one hears!


 


But who am I do offer


A simple, working poet


Who dares to ask these questions


Who is he to know it?


 


But I am not the only one


Who had questions that night


And even though each word we heard


We all agreed was right




Each word that night


Was holy


Each word, I know is true


But tell me practicality


What is one to do?

<p>I ask you please don’t lose it!</p>
<p>But, how could you go </p>
<p>Assur it</p>
<p>When those Rabbanim use it?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course they do not</p>
<p>Click themselves</p>
<p>A shamas does the work</p>
<p>I do not </p>
<p>Have that luxury</p>
<p>For I’m a simple jerk</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I do not have a gabbai</p>
<p>To check technical details</p>
<p>Or medical directories</p>
<p>Not simple, silly sales</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I ask you all</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>A simple yearning</p>
<p>Trying Jew?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who wakes at five to learn a blatt</p>
<p>And goes to sleep at twelve</p>
<p>Who struggles for parnassah</p>
<p>And in shtus will not delve</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yet he knows not</p>
<p>Just how to cope</p>
<p>His mortgage overdue</p>
<p>And If he can not transfer cash</p>
<p>Foreclosure will ensue!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I tried to make a ticket</p>
<p>I must get to LA</p>
<p>I call American and wait…</p>
<p>And sit there half the day!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He just received a notice</p>
<p>The IRS says pay!</p>
<p>He has to send them cash, right now?</p>
<p>They want it now! Today!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Should i  do it in<br />

<p>“Wait time is just an hour</p>
<p>But you can click on Sears </p>
<p>I will not use the internet</p>
<p>He yells!</p>
<p>But no one really cares!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And then they say</p>
<p>If you don’t click</p>
<p>We can’t help you at</p>
<p>Unless you drive down over here</p>
<p>And come down to the mall</p>
<p> </p>

		<description><![CDATA[Due to a family Simcha Mr. Bashevkin was not able to write
this week


 


Please welcome  guest
poet Joseph  Aish-oleh


 


They came in droves


From far and near


They were not sure


What they would hear


 


The message,


Some say


Was not clear


Some with hope


And some with fear


 


They came from far


They came from wide


40,000


Packed inside


 


Did they succeed?


I know they tried


To say what they felt


Deep inside


 


Emotions most


They tried to hide


And some they laughed


While others cried


 


I go back home


Although quite tired


Half the night


In traffic mired


Yet I arrived


All pumped!


Inspired


 


I won’t look on the web


Or log


On to any shtus or
blog


 


I will set my filtration high


Nothing assur


Will get by


I promise that I’ll never read


Any email I don’t need


 


I won’t care if Obama


Was born in USA


Or if another gadol


Has just now passed away


 


I will not look at matzav


I care not who is sick!


You want to tell me something


You better call not click!


 


I’ll look not at the Nais


Or at Yeshiva World


I will not let the wrath get me


Those curses they unfurled


 


I do not care if Iran


Will drop the Atom Bomb


I will not send a picture


Even to my Mom!


 


I’ll throw out all the messages


I won’t respond at all


You want to tell me something


Come to my home or call!


 


Oh! Yes I was Mekabel


I’m starting just today


I’ll just look at my clients mail


For after all, they pay!


 


But now I sit


In agony


I now feel like a fool


An email just came from


My son’s Mesivta
 School!


Rosh Ha Yeshiva wrote me


Responding to my call


He does not leave a number


“Please email back!” That’s all!


 


I ponder this


And wonder and then


What do I see?


Another email 


That just came


Straight from BMG!


 


It’s graphic


And its pretty


Oh!  What a lovely
sight!


Click to sponsor learning


On Holy Shavuos night!


 


The emails is quite fancy


I thought it pretty slick


Imagine! Sponsor Torah!


“Just make a simple click!”


 


 


Alas, I just was nichshal!


My body racked with rage!


I just was oiver my neder


At BMG’s web page!


 


A standard set


For you and me


Should it not hold


For the marquee?


 


Am I allowed to ask


These things?


 


Can I express the feeling


Or will I just become a piece


Of glued on pashkeveilin?


 


 


Can I ask anyone 


Who sat 


Upon that dais high?


Did ever through a web site


An airline ticket buy?


 


And some of those


Who sat on high


Do any of them own?


A blackberry, an Android?


Even an iphone!


 


Again, I’m sure


It’s filtered


But I heard that’s assur too…


Is that standard for those men?


Or just for me and you?


 


And shuckling in harmony


To all that they did say


But I heard that many sitting there


Send e-mails every day!


 


I don’t mean to be 


Chutzpadik


I ask you please don’t lose it!


But, how could you go 


Assur it


When those Rabbanim use it?


 


Of course they do not


Click themselves


A shamas does the work


I do not 


Have that luxury


For I’m a simple jerk


 


I do not have a gabbai


To check technical details


Or medical directories


Not simple, silly sales


 


I ask you all


What do I do?


A simple yearning


Trying Jew?


 


Who wakes at five to learn a blatt


And goes to sleep at twelve


Who struggles for parnassah


And in shtus will not delve


 


Yet he knows not


Just how to cope


His mortgage overdue


And If he can not transfer cash


Foreclosure will ensue!


 


I tried to make a ticket


I must get to LA


I call American and wait…


And sit there half the day!


 


He just received a notice


The IRS says pay!


He has to send them cash, right now?


They want it now! Today!


 


Should i  do it in
the  business!


Sneak behind the boss


And check out your deductible


It’s his work and his loss?


 


His air conditioner just broke


The filter needs replacing


Its been two weeks 


He can’t get through


His wife gives him a lacing!


He says I’m calling them up now


What he hears is debasing


 


“Wait time is just an hour


But you can click on Sears 


I will not use the internet


He yells!


But no one really cares!


 


And then they say

He gets into the car that nigh


And enters to the mall


What does he see


A bunch of bums


With, Drugs and alcohol?


 


My kid is wheezing


He is sick


One day, Overnight


Just click!


 


A medicine it does arrive


A formula keeps him alive


But lo it comes from


Arkansas


Should I click


And break your law?


 


I could give scenarios


I know of hundreds more


This is the curse of galus


A fog


And nothing’s klohr


 


A group of women


Who share pain


Of  children deemed
autistic


A Pittsburgh
man who has a boy


With Fibrosis called Cystic


 


May I get an article


To deal with Melanoma


Or finding the world’s expert


For someone in a coma?




I don’t mean to disparage


Or nullify those views


I have so many questions


Not answered by a shmuz


 


Of course we need the chizuk


But I’m old not a teen


I understand


How bad it is


It’s not a magazine


 


And every word of mussar


About the greatest test


Is worthy of a stadium


Packed 10 times at best!


 


We have some brilliant minds out there


And I have some ideas


Like learning mussar


Every day


Something that no one hears!


 


But who am I do offer


A simple, working poet


Who dares to ask these questions


Who is he to know it?


 


But I am not the only one


Who had questions that night


And even though each word we heard


We all agreed was right




Each word that night


Was holy


Each word, I know is true


But tell me practicality


What is one to do?

		<description><![CDATA[REPOSTED -- In Better Format.
I&#039;m glad you found Rav Wachsman&#039;s speeches inspiring.
He&#039;s a fiery speaker.However, as to his standing as a posek, let alone a posek for Klal Yisroel, no need to cite sources to dispute his authority to impose the asifa&#039;s rulings upon Klal Yisroel. Just watch what happens next year in yeshivas across the country (actually, across the world).See how seriously THEY take Rav Wachsman&#039;s declaration.See whether they bar each and every student with internet access in their home, even with a filter.According to the takana, they must.According to Rav Wachsman, that takana was binding on all schools.Let&#039;s see if the schools -- each and every school in the entire world -- take Rav Wachsman&#039;s authority to make halachic determinations as seriously you do.If so, the asifa might have solved the tuition crisis, given that Rov children in the frum world will be forced out of all yeshivos and their parents will have no choice but to enroll in public school.Tuition Crisis solved! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I forwarded your article to my brother and he had a response:

&quot;The fact is that, for people like me (and I&#039;m assuming that there are a few), the asifa was a success.  I felt encouraged to use the internet only when necessary (&quot;business&quot; or otherwise), and not for leisure.
Some people forget that when halacha is involved, one cannot argue: &quot;But the world is so far away from that!&quot;  Halacha is to be followed regardless.  The only question is: What is the halacha?

The answer is:  The gemara says that one who must get somewhere and has two ways to get there, one with pritzus and one without, and he goes the way with pritzus, EVEN IF HE DOESN&#039;T LOOK, has done an aveira.

Therefore, when internet usage is THE ONLY PATH to get to what you NEED, it is mutar, and do you best not to see pritzus.  But, when usage is not NECESSARY, but is just for leisure, EVEN ONE WHO SEES NO PRITZUS has done an aveira (assuming that he has put himself in a position in which pritzus could have been seen).

That is the halacha.  It doesn&#039;t matter how far away most of us are from that.  We have to meet the Torah where it is, not the other way around.

The BIG question is: What qualifies as &quot;necessary?&quot;  Saving money.  Convenience.  Secular knowledge.  Torah knowledge (when non-internet avenues exist).  That requires a shaylah.

That question was not discussed simply because it does not have a one-size-fits-all answer.  Every Jew must have a rebbe with whom to discuss the shaylah of what is necessray for HIM.  The asifa was for general chizuk, which it gave.

As for the Israeli rabbanim who were more extreme, it is known that Isareli rabbanim are always more extreme.  One who cannot live with their ideals should consult with his American daas Torah provider.  (I don&#039;t hold myself to Isareli standards.)    

And as for R&#039; Efraim Wachsman, he was AMAZING!  The person who was picking on him was clearly looking for a bone to pick in as many places as possible.  And before we can criticize R&#039; Wachsman for his halachic ruling that the asifa&#039;s takanos would be binding on every Jew, we need to research the halacha and figure out whether or not he is correct.  People who don&#039;t learn Torah tend to be very narrow minded and limit their view of reality to that which is comfortable for them.  Those who do learn Torah, on the other hand, are always open minded; their only question is:  What does the Torah say?  You want to convince me that you are right and I am wrong?  Fine.  Prove it from the Torah.  Had this critic cited a halachic ruling that contradicted R&#039; Wachsman, I would be more inclined to give his criticism some thought.  Until then, in my mind, he&#039;s just like a child who throws a tantrum for not getting what he wants.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R.Salomon was not hijacked at all. He came up with this asifa idea together with Nechemya Gottlieb. They booked citifield without consulting the rosh yeshivas in america and then expected their help to fill the stadium. The rosh yeshivas by and large did not like the idea of the asifa nor that they were bypassed and that R.Salomon went directly to R.Chaim Kanievsky in Israel, for what they feel is an american issue best dealt with by those who know this kehila. Since they never got strongly behind it ticket sales were very slow so R.Salomon panicked and went to the chasidim to increase their numbers in order to fill the stadium. As we know that meant loosing the women, the expo, the english and in the end even the message itself!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And there are plenty of big gatherings, for example:

* The #j14 gatherings last summer were pretty big, certainly more than 50,000.
* The Tel Aviv gay pride parade is a gathering that is pretty large.
* The Israel Day parade each year gets a few hundred thousand people.

Lots of examples of large gatherings of Jewish men, women, and children!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s estimated that over 50,000 Jewish men, women and children attend the Birkat Kohanim at the Kotel every Pessach and Sukkot, and that over 100,000 gather at Hakhel. Granted, as a die-hard Mets fan living near Jerusalem I (sadly) understand the appeal of Citi Field.  But yesh omrim that gathering at the Kotel to fulfill Biblical commandments to accept Ohl Malchut Shamayim, as a nation in its home while facing Har Habayit at the spot most sanctified by G-d and Jewish history is even greater. The very idea that the Rabbis can issue an edict that binds the Jewish people from Citi Field, a place that (unlike its predecessor, Shea Stadium) has given Jews nothing but pain, is preposterous. And on Yom Yerushalyim no less. Gedolim?! Is there any question that these people, who separate themselves from the Nation of Israel and the values of the Torah, are the very people who would have been stoning and cursing King David many years ago?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[

I am so sad…


This way I feel


 


All the news…


Hate, fear, anger and rage


Staining every page


 


Pain and sadness 


Are the voices of this madness


 


So much deception and duplicity


Love and peace, it seems would muddy the simplicity 


 


Is everyone out for the kill?


Will nothing less will fit the bill


 


Oh! Where to go


To escape realities blow


 


Up, Down and all around,


Tragedy and crisis abound


 


The pain, for all the slain.


The tragedies, so great,


Is there no escape


From all this hate?


 


Under its weight


The good stand by in silenced state


While animosity


Perpetuates terrible acts of horror and savagery 


 


To what gain? 


Is it some feeling we hope to attain?


Power and might?


Is that the outcome of all this fright?


No! Its cowardice and despicable


But isn’t that what fear is – predictable


 


Wrong and right…


Are they but the fancy of the beholders might?


 


If all the ends are of this perception


What is life but a deception?


 


How can we escape this stain?


All this fear and pain


 


Under a cloak of a righteousness guise


Is a ferocious hate you disguise


 


But I know that while you wear this might


It’s all from fright


 


Truth you decry


Truth you proclaim


And, no, of course, not for fame


 


I am in a bind


For in my mind,


You must be wrong


So that my right and might be strong


 


And if so, 


Where will this go?


And to what sight


Can we see an end to this blight?


 


Are we so naive


To conceive and believe


That this onslaught I can escape 


And not be crushed in its wake?


 


When will we come to cognize


On this path, truth, peace and love is not what we will
realize


Do I dare to dream?


To hope or believe 


That life is more than what it seems?


 


I want to be free


I want to be free


But, how can I be?


 


Of this I am left to consider


To wonder and ponder


What if


It’s everyone else


That I see


Inside of me


So much fear and dis-ease


 


With eyes full of confusion you beam


Thinking, ‘what do you mean??’


Then it clicks, “OH!”


No, No! we scream


It can’t be me!


How can this be?


Yet, if we were to stop and inspect


Investigate and reflect


And understand that I can only comprehend


Using the senses I have in hand


Then it can only be


That which in others I feel, hear and see


Their problems


Their faults


Their clothing


Their religion


Their faces


Is all misconstrue


For what I see in thee


Is just a mirror of me


Can we conceive?


That all of this that makes me cry


Is really what’s inside


And not outside of I

		<description><![CDATA[One response I received to my comment was:

 At some point early on in the speeches I turned to the 
person sitting next to me and said exactly that. We need to bring back 
TIDE. They keep talking about building walls. Sure, RSRH writes that 
Avraham Avinu went between the cities and called out in the name of 
Hasem over there, separate from society at first, but he also points out
 (Beraishis 20:1) that vayagar b&#039;Grar - it is necessary to know about 
this world in order to know how to deal with it.Well
 we ended up getting into a debate and the person started telling me 
that RSRH&#039;s derech creates am aratzim and people who go off the derech 
but the kollel derech produces frum lomdei
 Torah. I won&#039;t get into my response and his response etc. but the 
debate turned in to quite a fight. Then.... when they had Rav Wosner 
call in a psak from Bnei Brak, I foolishly asked him why was it 
necessary to call E&quot;Y for a psak. Are there no poskimin America. He told
 me I am a very messed up person  - and that was the end of our 
conversation.Wow!I
 couldn&#039;t sleep when I got home. I kept thinking about this, over and 
over. I told my wife that even though I&#039;ve been talking about writing my
 sefer summarizing RSRH&#039;s concepts for years and haven&#039;t found the time,
 I can no longer put it off. I don&#039;t know how long this will take, but 
the work begins now.


Another was:

The internet is  a tool that can be used for tremendous good or evil.
We have to reinvigorate the Judaism that we teach with passion, G-d
and Dveikus to Him and teach our kids how to stand up to nisayon while
at the same time protect themselves..  Chilul Hashem and kiddush
Hashem is also tied into this, as is the status of the chareidim in
Eretz Yisroel.

We should talk]]></description>

 sefer summarizing RSRH&#8217;s concepts for years and haven&#8217;t found the time,<br />

<p>The internet is  a tool that can be used for tremendous good or evil.<br />
We have to reinvigorate the Judaism that we teach with passion, G-d<br />
and Dveikus to Him and teach our kids how to stand up to nisayon while<br />
at the same time protect themselves..  Chilul Hashem and kiddush<br />
Hashem is also tied into this, as is the status of the chareidim in<br />
Eretz Yisroel.</p>
<p>We should talk</p>
