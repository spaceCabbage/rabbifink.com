		<description><![CDATA[I have always had a problem with saying that someone that commits a crime, like murder is sick, because it implies it not really their fault!

Good friend of mine was abused by her husband, (she is since divircd, thank god) but i still to this day hear people say things like, he is sick, he was sick, he needs to be medicated, etc etc

It lessens the evil that he committed on his wife for all those years, people end up excusing his abuse, becasue he is ill, he has a mental illness, its not his fault.  

BS, it is his fault.  He chose to beat her, he chose to yell at her constatntly for years, him and no one else, him and not an angel, him and not a seraph, him and not his add, him and not his bipolar disorder]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. I assumed you were arguing that since Islamic countries have a high rate of suicide bombers that indicates Islam does turn people into killers. To which I respond post hoc ergo propter hoc as the religion may not be the cause of the wanton death, rather there may be other causes unmentioned in your argument.


3. Or, one of the gun lobby&#039;s favorite lines is that guns don&#039;t kill people kill. And I am saying ideology does not kill, people kill. Similar arguments. 


But the differences are too great to make any reasonable inference from this post to gun control.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. I&#039;m not sure what you mean by &quot;correlation does not equal causation.&quot; (I know what it means, but I&#039;m not sure what you&#039;re saying that about.)


3. I guess it may be a different argument. But one of the arguments against gun control is that we need guns to stop the murderers. Saying that most people (i.e those who are not crazies) will not use those guns to kill (on account of their not being crazy) seems to strengthen that argument. (But you&#039;re right, it&#039;s a different argument.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right. You were specific about that and I only skimmed the post before commenting. I&#039;m sorry.


That said,


1. When the religion people bring into these discussions is Islam, it&#039;s based on a belief that the murderers are imbued with the values of those societies which you don&#039;t call &quot;modern.&quot;


2. I still feel that your argument about only crazy people murdering is incorrect. (You should read that Grantland link if you didn&#039;t.)


3. Your argument about crazies vs. non-crazies seems just a step away from an argument strongly condemning gun control. Would you make that step? (You don&#039;t have to answer this; might not be a fair question to ask.)]]></description>
