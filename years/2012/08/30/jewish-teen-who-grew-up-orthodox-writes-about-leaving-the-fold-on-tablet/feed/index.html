		<description><![CDATA[Having read some of the posts questioning why there is not a response to Bible criticism and Torah Min Hashamayim, I feel compelled to respond. The reason I feel compelled derives from what I believe was Hashgacha Pratit/God&#039;s involvement in our lives.  After reading the posts I was troubled that an articulate response was needed but did not feel up to the task. The next day I was unable to make it to my regular Shul in Chashmonaim, Israel and went to the Chabbad Minyan. There in a Chabad Shul in Chashmonaim was a &quot;Hertz&quot; Chumash next to where I was standing. Between Bereishit and Shemot, Chief Rabbi Hertz addresses Bible critics, particularly the mistaken allegations of multiple authors.  In fact besides the Aish.com arguments, Jewish and non-Jewish theologians have addressed the critics arguments, however most of these discussions appear in earlier times when such criticism was &quot;in vogue&quot;  and can even be &quot;googled&quot;. Also some criticisms that were alleged based upon scientific reasoning and proof have subsequently been repudiated by archaeological finds. For example, critics had explained how it was beyond doubt that there were two Isaiahs (?) written at two different times by different authors. Their &quot;proofs&quot; convinced many students, however subsequently among the Dead Sea Scrolls was found a single scroll predating the dates the critics insisted were the date of authorship. Same thing with arguments about camels being used for travel in the time of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs, with subsequent findings of supporting archaeological finds.  Again I felt compelled to respond though I did not think a convincing detailed response could be made in this forum. However, I would be glad to discuss further if there are specific items.  On a basic level, though perhaps not scientific, I still personally feel a straightforward reading of the Biblical prophecies and the unfolding of Jewish history particularly in the past 100 years (and my own life&#039;s experiences) warrant a healthy skepticism of the critics rejection of the BIble and a justified belief in the Divine nature of the Torah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there is something much more systemic going on.  People have been leaving orthodoxy-ish/traditional halachic Judaism for a very long time (even pre-haskalah this was happening in Germany).  Except during the eras where religion was state (aka pre-enlightment) there were always Jewish communities with rich senses of self to go to if you weren&#039;t going to be in this rabbinical oriented method of community.  I mean, there were Yiddish Pop Songs about the sinking of the titanic, balls on yom kippur in 1886, ect.  


That has disappeared as Jewish people entered the establishment post ww2.  My grandfather, despite being extremely wealthy in his 20s, went to yiddish theater.  My father went to MIT instead (and my father is orthodox now).  Entering and staying in the establishment is a full time job, and Jewish institutions mimic establishment institutions.  There isn&#039;t anything paritcuarly natively Jewish about them, barring some examples within orthodoxy. Of course people just dissipate, as Jewish atheist on tumblr mentions, Reform Judaism has elements of a social club (with ritualized socializing rather than socializing socializing).  There is nothing to go to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No one makes decisions and does things for only intellectual reasons (R. Fink acknowledged this in one his replies.)   The people who claim to do so are fooling themselves and anyone who agrees with them.  Therefore, intellectual/analytical arguments/proofs to address people are limited in value - I am not saying valueless.  

The value of being an &quot;orthodox&quot; Jew is questionable.  Who defines orthodoxy?  When does a person stop being &quot;orthodox&quot;?  When they do not keep a single halacha of Shabbos once?  Twice?  When they do not keep Shabbos at all, but do other Mitzvot?  When they stop being honest in business and personal relations?  When they stop wearing a suit or black trousers 24/7?  When does a person begin being &quot;orthodox&quot;?  When they do everything perfectly?  It is not going to happen.  Was Moshe &quot;orthodox&quot;?  He actually changed 3 G-d given halachot, I think I learned (and Moshe spoke face-to-face with Gd.  Who else has done that according to &quot;orthodox&quot; Judaism.)  It makes no sense to argue these things - our lives are so complex and multifaceted.

Perhaps, this young man is actually doing the right things.  Making Gd smile.  He is searching and seeks integrity.  That is G-dly.  Look at Gd&#039;s creation: it is a failure, He admits it Himself all over the Tanach/Bible.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one makes decisions and does things for only intellectual reasons (R. Fink acknowledged this in one his replies.)   The people who claim to do so are fooling themselves and anyone who agrees with them.  Therefore, intellectual/analytical arguments/proofs to address people are limited in value &#8211; I am not saying valueless.  </p>
<p>The value of being an &#8220;orthodox&#8221; Jew is questionable.  Who defines orthodoxy?  When does a person stop being &#8220;orthodox&#8221;?  When they do not keep a single halacha of Shabbos once?  Twice?  When they do not keep Shabbos at all, but do other Mitzvot?  When they stop being honest in business and personal relations?  When they stop wearing a suit or black trousers 24/7?  When does a person begin being &#8220;orthodox&#8221;?  When they do everything perfectly?  It is not going to happen.  Was Moshe &#8220;orthodox&#8221;?  He actually changed 3 G-d given halachot, I think I learned (and Moshe spoke face-to-face with Gd.  Who else has done that according to &#8220;orthodox&#8221; Judaism.)  It makes no sense to argue these things &#8211; our lives are so complex and multifaceted.</p>
<p>Perhaps, this young man is actually doing the right things.  Making Gd smile.  He is searching and seeks integrity.  That is G-dly.  Look at Gd&#8217;s creation: it is a failure, He admits it Himself all over the Tanach/Bible.  I don&#8217;t think he has to stop wearing T&#8217;fillin to do that, but apparently he understands (intellectually, emotionally, interpersonally) that he does . . . for now.  Do we want him to put on T&#8217;fillin, keep Shabbos, marry a nice Jewish girl, struggle to pay day-school tuition, and do it miserably or with part of himself cut off from life?

		<description><![CDATA[What I described is one of the ways high schools think they are dealing with it.  Ways that in the long run may do more harm than good.  At least at the local MO high school near me, one rabbi uses that among other typical kiruv style proofs in a class he gives.  It seems like they think they&#039;ll &quot;arm&quot; the students with the kiruv &quot;proofs&quot; beforehand so that when questions arise, at least they&#039;ll remember that whatever the question, there are ample reasons to believe in the divine origin of the Torah.   Not a bad idea, but only if you have good proofs to start with.   ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think an example Avi might agree with is when Kiruv workers try to awe people with the Torah, when it enumerates 4 species of animals that only one of the two kosher signs and then make the claim that even in our day there have been none others found.   The only problem is that it is a lie.   It relies on the audience being ignorant of the llama, alpaca, and vicuna that all chew their cud but don&#039;t have split hooves.   The Kiruv worker would likely tell you they are all &quot;Gamal&quot; (camels) in the language of the Torah, but it&#039;s ludicrous.   Look them up on Wikipedia.  They as different as Lions, Tigers, Leopards, Panthers, Cheetahs and even the Persian kitty - which may all be &quot;cats&quot; but no one, not even the Torah, would claim them to be the same species or min.    (There are further reasons as to why this claim is false... but I deem these examples sufficient that a rational person will feel deceived when they delve into it.)

I&#039;m sure you have heard this claim, and others that are used by Kiruv workers and have even spread into the mainstream among MO yeshiva high school teachers, and it&#039;s detrimental to the inquisitive mind who will look to validate the claim and not take it on face value.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;This is a real issue for teens and for adults. I believe it is the biggest challenge that the orthodox Jewish community is facing today.


Yes, and with all the man hours wasted over in yeshivot over Talmud, good answers have yet to come up to ANY real question. (I mean, if you have a question about some legal minutia, then sure, you will get an a real answer). 


&#062;But I think the most basic first step to a solution is rooted in dialogue about these issues.



Ok. Then what? We have a dialogue. Teens are still looking for answers. Will rabbis then start having logical rebuttals to Higher Criticism? To science questions? To questions of morality vs. torah? Many of us here have been searching and searching and not one thing has been answered. ]]></description>

&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062; Are you aware of anywhere
these questions are addressed satisfactorily?


 


I’ve been looking for 40 years. The answer
seems to me to be: “Nowhere” and the reason likely is, is that the more an
intelligent person, not hampered by blind faith, looks, the more he tends to
arrive at the conclusion that the evidence points away from TMS (Torah m’sinai).


 

If traditional Judaism is to survive, some intelligent
re-drawing of the 13 Ikkraim is absolutely necessary, but not as the Reform
did, throwing out the baby with bathwater.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is not just a teen issue.  I am a middle aged man with a family. I came to orthodoxy at around this boy&#039;s age largely based on intellectual understanding and now greater understanding is leading me away. I have and have always had access and strong relationships with extremely learned and warm scholars.  It&#039;s not always about finding &quot;answers&quot; as many of today&#039;s &quot;questions&quot; cannot be answered. (The trite &quot;proofs&quot; which used to have me enamored are laughable now in my eyes.)

I know this seems scary to orthodox people, especially rabbis (open minded ones like yourself) but I believe that if Judaism is going to survive it&#039;s going to have to adapt to man&#039;s growing knowledge and understanding. We (yes I still consider myself &quot;in the camp) may have to even adapt ideas from reform and conservative.  I strongly suggest you read a new book called &quot;Torah from Heaven&quot; by Norman Solomon to get an idea of where we may have to go to survive as a people.

And I am not alone, not by a long shot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s probably true that almost nobody does almost anything for purely intellectual reasons.


I don&#039;t think it matters whether most people leave for intellectual reasons or not, and this kid isn&#039;t necessarily an exception. 


People don&#039;t become frum for intellectual reasons either but we&#039;ve developed a whole body of intellectual arguments to convince them to become frum, we haven&#039;t done that for the person who wants to become frei.]]></description>
