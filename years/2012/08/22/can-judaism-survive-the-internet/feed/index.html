		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Is mocking evolution
and science a necessary component of chasidic life? 


 


Chassidus is, among
other things, the Jewish analog of the pietist movement. It was a reaction by
religion to the scientific revolution and the demystification of the world. They
went the other way, and brought back all the mystery and mysticism. So, yes,
mocking, or at least marginalizing science is a necessary component of
chassidus.


 


Mocking evolution is a
(widely successful) attempt to delegitimize evolution and maintain the convincingness
of the Argument from Design.


 


&#062; Does chasidic life
require that the non-chasid be stigmatized and delegitimized?


 


Can‚Äôt speak for Chassidim, but
in the yeshivish world, the answer is a resounding, ‚ÄúYES.‚Äù Though that mostly
applies to people to the left of the community.  ]]></description>

teenagers from early marriage, or to offer education, would be vilified in the
Chassidich communities. They would be condemned as worse than the goyim, because

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re absolutely right with option 3 being the only workable option. Unfortunately, Chasidic society, almost by definition, cannot embrace it; they cannot adapt by becoming more moderate, only by circling the wagons. (Let&#039;s not forget, this isn&#039;t new. Frum Jews lost thousands to the Haskalah. The Chasidic response, following the Chasam Sofer, was myopic rather than visionary. Chadash asur min hatorah. &quot;Ban everything.&quot;)


Which leads me to one of your later points, about non-Chasidic communities being the answer. I think this is an incredibly important point. 


I often hear MOs say to ex-Chasidic OTDs: &quot;Why throw away the baby with the bathwater?&quot; Setting aside what exactly is the baby and what is the bathwater, my question is: where are the MOs when individual Chasidim are still within, struggling to make sense of their screwed-up environments? 


When MOs tell OTDs: &quot;You can be religious and still get an education, still engage with broader society, still use the Internet and have access to knowledge and information.&quot; Well, why isn&#039;t the MO community telling this to the kids currently in Satmar and in Skver and in Viznitz and in Bobov? Where&#039;s the MO community when a yeshiva bachur wishes he could go to med school or law school? Where are they when a young man or woman is being led, at 17 or 18, into a marriage they did not choose? When they&#039;re told to just keep making babies without any idea what this means for them and their futures? Why isn&#039;t the MO community there to tell these kids: &quot;You don&#039;t have to do this?&quot; 


Of course, I think we know the answer to that. The MO world, strangely, still romanticizes Chasidim as the bearers of something old and authentic. As extreme and fanatic and shortsighted as Chasidim might be, the MO world is not concerned about their Yiddishkeit. And that&#039;s a huge mistake. Because the Chasidic worldview is simply unsustainable. Both those who remain within and those who fall away are losing out. The former by having access only to a vapid and superficial religious framework and the latter by the lost years and their educational handicaps and their broken families and a somewhat disoriented view of life in general and the secular world in particular.


So yes, the answer lies in the non-Chasidic (particularly MO) communities. But it appears that the MO community lacks the assertiveness to speak up about it, only daring to speak to those who&#039;ve already left -- and by then, I&#039;m afraid, it&#039;s already too late.

Where are they when a young man or woman is being led, at 17 or 18, into a marriage they did not choose? When they&#8217;re told to just keep making babies without any idea what this means for them and their futures? Why isn&#8217;t the MO community there to tell these kids: &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do this?&#8221; </p>
<p>Of course, I think we know the answer to that. The MO world, strangely, still romanticizes Chasidim as the bearers of something old and authentic. As extreme and fanatic and shortsighted as Chasidim might be, the MO world is not concerned about their Yiddishkeit. And that&#8217;s a huge mistake. Because the Chasidic worldview is simply unsustainable. Both those who remain within and those who fall away are losing out. The former by having access only to a vapid and superficial religious framework and the latter by the lost years and their educational handicaps and their broken families and a somewhat disoriented view of life in general and the secular world in particular.</p>
<p>So yes, the answer lies in the non-Chasidic (particularly MO) communities. But it appears that the MO community lacks the assertiveness to speak up about it, only daring to speak to those who&#8217;ve already left &#8212; and by then, I&#8217;m afraid, it&#8217;s already too late.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[IMO, this is the real issue the frum world has with the internet, whether they realize it or not. Pornography, while an issue, is a side show. Pictures of naked ladies are not going to challenge the foundations of orthodox Judaism.

Nor is this just an issue for Chassidim or Chareidim.  Yes, they&#039;ve created a house of cards built on ignorance and misinformation, but much of our basic foundational narratives, simplistically understood and accepted by most, can be easily challenged or refuted with a few simple internet searches. ]]></description>
