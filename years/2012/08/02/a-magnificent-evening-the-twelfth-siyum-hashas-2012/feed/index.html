		<description><![CDATA[There is no cognitive dissonance here. Each speaker at the Asifa took different tones regarding Internet use. But once more, I did not attend, nor do I necessarily share the views of those who spoke - though I respect what they said and believe that they have the right to share their thoughts with those that follow them - full ban, partial ban, non-business ban, etc. Those who went should have been those who associate themselves with one or more of the speakers. A person who attends a Met vs. Yankee game while being a fan of a third, rival team will most likely slander both of them. I continue to propose the concept that people certainly have the right to their views without slandering those with different views. I do not have to justify my use of the Internet, though perhaps others should justify why they feel it necessary to share negative thoughts about others. It is nothing shy of lashon hara d&#039;Oraysa. Your feelings and reflections about an Asifa, Siyum or any other event is your own personal business - and right, if you wish. However, sharing it publicly, although you surely can, is simply not right. Now, if you want to criticize any of my statements, so be it - you have that right. But negativity is negativity - and loshon hara is lashon hara. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s the thing. The Asifa was a fraud. It was sold as an evening to learn about how to use the Internet properly. The speakers hijacked the event and unequivocally prohibited the use of the Internet for almost every use.


I don&#039;t know who you are referring to, but the lay people, rabbanim, and Roshei Yeshiva that I spoke to felt the Asifa was a disaster. They felt there was no tangible inspiration and people had to grasp at straws to find anything positive about the event.


Your characterization in this line: &lt;i&gt;Yes, the gedolim stressed the dangers of the Internet and some of the evil it can represent without proper safeguarding&lt;/i&gt; is a lie. They did not do that at all. The psak was &quot;get off the Internet&quot;. End.


Sure, there have been many takanos and gzeiros made for kedushas klal yisrael, the Internet is a risky place. The Asifa did absolutely NOTHING to help people deal with the Internet. It was scare tactics at best and misinformed at worst.


Please explain this line of thinking: &quot;The rabbis at the Asifa assured the Internet, I am not going to listen to them, but I am inspired anyway.&quot; Honestly, it makes no sense.


I feel no need to support the Asifa. Every single rebbe, rav, and gadol I have discussed the Asifa with agrees with me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rav Fink&#039;s impressions of the Siyum I can relate to, and 
basically I had the same take. His comparisons to the Agudah Conventions (which 
I know almost nothing about), and fervernt wish that Agudah should continue the 
New Persona of the 12th Siyum Hashas, is a very common wish. For 2,000 years 
many jews wished that Yiddishkeit would come out of the box - and have a more 
contemporary and inclusive Gehfil. Some managed to do some of that in different 
ways and still remain Orthodox e.g.; Rabbeinu Moshe Ben Maimon zt&quot;l, Rav 
Shamshon Refael Hirsch zt&quot;l. Rav Ezriel Hildesheimer zt&quot;l but they weren&#039;t so 
inclusive as R&#039; Fink would like, even Rav J. B. Soloveitchik zt&quot;l wasn&#039;t so 
inclusive.

 

 

As for the 
comparison of the Asifa to the Siyum, I must say it is intellectually dishonest. 
No question, we would like a Torah that only says YES, R&#039; Shlomo Carlebach tried 
to forge his own path of basically saying YES and trying to playdown the NO. 
Well, watch what happens as it unfolds in the long run! Rav Hirsch expresses it 
succinctly &quot;the Torah isn&#039;t mans ideas about God, but God&#039;s ideas about man&quot;. 
Whether you agree or not, the Boireh Kol Ha&#039;olomim has His rights! He chose to 
reveal to us at Sinai not just 248 positive precepts but also 365 negative &quot;NO&quot; 
precepts. It is an accepted Halachik fact that on MItzvos Asey one shouldn&#039;t 
spend more than a Chomesh - a fifth of ones income but on a Mitzvos Lo Saseh it 
is incumbent that one spend all his fortune to be saved from transgression. Even 
more so concerning the three cardinal sins of Avodah Zorah, Gilu Arayos, 
U&#039;Shfichas Domim where one must give up his very life and not transgress. 

 

 

The Ramban 
explains how these to two apposing types of Mitzvos represent the two primary 
root categories of Avodas Hashem i.e.; Ahava - love, Yireh - fear and awe. As we 
cruise through life we need the gas peddle and equally important (if not more 
so) is the brakes. If you don&#039;t want to accept this reality, no sentient being 
would travel with you in your vehicle. It is very easy to want the experiential 
rush and high of the YES trip, if others have done the necessary safety 
groundwork for you. Many Sifrei Kodesh expound on the primacy of &quot;Yiras Hashem&quot;, 
teaching that it precedes the Avoda of Ahavas Hashem. See for example Rebbe 
Nachman of Breslov&#039;s Likutei Moharan, Chelek Alef - Torah 5, paragraph 5; he 
teaches (based on the Tikkunei Zohar, Zohar, Toras Habaal Shem Tov and the 
Mezeritcher Magid) that concerning Yirah - fear and awe of Hashem it says 
&quot;Reishis Chochma Yiras Hashem&quot; this is the primary true wisdom&quot;. He goes on to 
explain how it is the Derech of a person to search for his Aveida - his lost 
property. Likewise Chazal state that it is normal for a man to search for a 
suitable wife. Man, sybolizes Ahavas Hashem, the woman *Isha Yiras Hashem&quot; - the 
Aveida, lost property - symbolizes the fear and awe of Heaven. This means that 
Hashem&#039;s Seder in creation is that one should first and foremost persue and 
attain Yiras Shomayim (the aspect of Isha Yirash Hashem) automatically the Ish - 
the man (Ahaves Hashem) will gravitate to you. 

 

Just like Chazal 
at one point found it necessary to introduce the Birchas Haminim into the Amida, 
in order to vanquish the Reshoim and say NO. Likewise the Talmidei Chasam Sofer 
published a proclamation of multiple NO in  the Takkunos of 1860 - to safeguard 
the core Temimim from the inroads of Reform. In a similar vein the more modern 
and progressive Rav S. R. Hirsch in Frankfurt wrote fiery letters of exclusion 
and NO, he spared no words and invectives concerning the timid Rabbonim who 
can&#039;t say NO. So there is a time and place for everything. So too concerning the 
Asifa - based on the people around me and many Kehillos that I know of all had 
great benefit from the Asifa. It was a catalyst - jump started by many Gedolei 
Yisroel - that gave the momentum to initiate change and improvements concerning 
the use of the internet. The heightened awareness brought a willingness to learn 
to live with boundaries, and not be enslaved by Social Media etc. and the 
exchange of vital information on how to safeguard ones family. One must have a 
kind eye, for those who are still fighting to preserve the core holiness of 
their Yiddishe Neshama - they have an unapologetic right to refuse to lower the 
bar. The holy Rebbe of Satman zt&#039;l once commented to a certain known newspaper 
journalist (for a Yiddishe Tzeitung) who exclaimed to the Rebbe that he doesn&#039;t 
get harmed by looking at women, the Rebbe asked him &quot;how much does one have to 
sin in order to reach that Madreiga&quot;!!! Often our critique of people who are 
more stringent than ourselves stems from an inner longing for purity, and 
frustration with not knowing how to implement lasting positive change.

 

I have no 
problem though exploring, why we Orthodox aren&#039;t more proactive instead of only 
reacting. Why did we have to lose thousands of Jewish girls till we made and 
accepted the Bais Yakov movement for girls. Why did we allow the loss of 
generations to Treif Posul writings till we started Chareidi Newspapers and 
Magazines. Why did we have to sleep for ten years till we made and Asifa, 
actually in this case, by being proactive we wouldn&#039;t need an Asifa at 
all!

 

All in all I 
enjoyed Rabbi Finks article, personally I&#039;m inclined to inclusiveness so I can 
relate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It isn&#039;t fair to punish the many for the few. Although one may find several issues with the event, I believe that with an event that has so much positive, one must put aside the negative. But, as with any event, such as the Asifa, anyone can choose to attend or not. It doesn&#039;t have to represent everyone - and that&#039;s perfectly alright. The Asifa and/or Siyum could be a meaningful experience for some and not others. Perhaps we shouldn&#039;t fight our battles from one front to another. We fight issues head-on without the need for unnecessary negativity for others. There are children being abused - we need to fight that! There are people with addictions, such as drugs, alcohol, gambling, on-line &quot;immodesty&quot; - we need to fight that. All in the right way at the right time.  Just my thought. ]]></description>

Why if the whole thing was supposedly torah, did the hesped on Moron Rav Eliyashiv come only fter 3.5 hours in the program but for Schottenstein (the money) did it come right at the begining ? Why at CitiField were the tickets only $10 and the bus $5. And at the agudah party ....? I think you should really rethink what you wrote.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No. Granted, the program could definitely have been run a lot better, but it was not an outright ban. The Rabbanim of the Ichud Hakehillos, which arranged the event, have clearly stated when and how the Internet can be used, and have set up (and are working on setting up) TAG and similar offices around the globe to help people use the Internet when necessary with the least potential for damage. I&#039;ve personally been in contact with my local TAG office, under the guidance of Rav Mattisyahu Salamon, shlit&quot;a, on several occasions to safeguard my Internet usage, and they never told me that I was banned from using it. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is that the &quot;content&quot; of your comment is mostly a fabrication - it is what we all expected the asifa to be about. We expected it to be about how to protect yourself and your family from the evil that lurks on the Internet. Instead we got an outright ban. And to add insult to injury, we were told that anyone who attended the asifa, just by virtue of their attendance, was bound to that ruling under penalty of losing their chelek in olam haba!


If you want to see something better and closer to what the asifa should have been, take a look at R&#039; Gil Student&#039;s series of videos about the Internet -

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s great to read something positive about the charedi world on this site, but your snide, and completely uncalled for, bashing of the Citi Field Asifa negates anything you may have accomplished with this post. Your simpleton characterization of Citi Field as standing &quot;against something&quot; is just shallow.  

Citi Field stood for kedusha, shemiras einayim and a determination to sacrifice pleasure and convenience on behalf of Hashem. Despite all the previous naysaying, the amount of yidden (some goyim too) who were inspired towards tangible positive change by Rabbi Wachsman and others at Citi Field is absolutely amazing.

Yes, the gedolim stressed the dangers of the Internet and some of the evil it can represent without proper safeguarding -and I&#039;m glad they did. Use all the cliches about honey and vinegar you want, but Dovid Hamelech told us millennia ago &quot;Sur m&#039;rah v&#039;aaseh tov.&quot; Before we can be properly inspired by the beauty and positivity of Torah and Yiddishkeit, we must work on distancing ourselves from the yetzer hora and his tools. 

Chazal talk about people who learn Torah without being an appropriate vessel for it; it&#039;s called &quot;nezem zahav b&#039;af chazir,&quot; a gold ring on the nose of a pig. There are countless Gemaras talking about recognizing the yetzer hora and how he entraps people. They tell us that &quot;Ki setze lamilchama al oyvecha&quot; -declaring war on our enemy- refers to the &quot;Milchemes hayetzer&quot; against the yetzer hora. 

Yes, &quot;war&quot; against the yetzer hora isn&#039;t pretty, positive and flowery, but the yidden throughout the generations who engaged in battle against his &quot;feel good&quot; promises are what enabled us to be here today, learn Torah, and celebrate grand Siyumim. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While it may not have been technically necessary, there were plenty of people there who would have felt very uncomfortable davening without one (whether or not you think they are justified to feel that way). Rabbi Fink mentioned that they were being &quot;politically correct, inclusive, and diverse&quot;. 
I think included in that would be putting up a mechitzah for 35 minutes as to not make thousands of people uncomfortable. I haven&#039;t heard a single woman who was there complain about it (although I&#039;m sure there were.) Being inclusive and diverse means trying to find the grounds that is as &quot;good for everyone&quot; as you can get, not &quot;doing things the way I happen to think is right&quot;. I think they did an excellent job with the mechitza in using it when they should and not using it when they shouldn&#039;t.
