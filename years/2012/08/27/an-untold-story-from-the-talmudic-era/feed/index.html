		<description><![CDATA[The idea of using animal imagery in the synagogue did make its way to mainstream rabbinic Judaism.  We see it the images of lions on arks and torah mantels.   The second commandment is very explicit in its prohibition of the use of imagery of animals.  However, even rabbinic Judaism manged to take a narrower interpretation of that commandment to make allowances for what was popular at the time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did the Bavli take itself as seriously as we are taking it it today? 
Rav Zeira davened to forget his Bovel learning, Bovel being called &quot;Eretz Chashucha&quot;, Rav &#038; Shmuel overturned very easily by Rav Ashi, many Halochos brought down anonymously (&quot;stamo&#039;e&quot;), droshos to underpin a machlokes with no historical background (the protractors were long dead) and many more ideas brought down without apparent messora.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a hard time with the orthodox view of our uninterrupted &quot;prushim&quot; messora.
Machloket Bavli/Yerushalmi, Ravina/Rav Ashi vs. rest of the Amoraim, Zohar, Litta derech ha&#039;limud &#038; weltanshauung etc. &#038; all the huge historical time gaps over the last 2 millenia makes my yeshivishe kop spin.

		<description><![CDATA[Great article. These kinds of findings can often make frum Jews today uncomfortable, but it is really important to understand that Judaism at the time of bayit sheini was as fractured and sectarian (and perhaps even more so) than it is today. Also, thought you would get a kick of this comment thread. http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/daf-yomi-1 P.S. I love your daf yomi shiur! It is a fast and easy way to get through the daf, without spending hours and hours like in yeshiva. ]]></description>
