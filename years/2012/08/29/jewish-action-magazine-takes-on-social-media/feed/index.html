		<description><![CDATA[By the time your kids are teens there will be no &quot;dumb phones&quot;.
Good luck, and I&#039;m not trying to discourage you from enforcing your rules, but as a mom of teenagers for over 8 years, it&#039;s getting increasingly difficult to avoid letting my kids have gadgets with internet access. 
I also think you have to gradually ease your rules as your kids mature.  
Most 19 year olds can buy their own laptops with summer job money.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; “I would like to point out that I personally
heard the venerated Lakewood Mashgiach Rabbi Matisyahu Salomon say that the
Internet is not the enemy—the yetzer hara is.” This it the first I have heard of this
sentiment from R’ Matisyahu. It is certainly a positive development.


 


That depends on what he means.
If he means that the internet is neutral, and we each must control our urges to
do things we shouldn’t then I would agree that this quote is a (surprising)
step in the right direction. 


 


I suspect, however, that he
means something more along the lines of the Yetzer Hara as an anthropomorphic
devil trying to trick us into doing evil things, and the internet is one of his
nefarious tools. Is there any way to find out the context of the quote?]]></description>
