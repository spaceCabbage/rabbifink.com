		<description><![CDATA[He was a great man. I still find myself quoting him, or one of his anecdotes on a regular basis. There is one story that stands out in my mind right now and i have no idea why but ill share it. Rav tendler gave a bekius shiur to a select group of 12th graders (i have no idea what his selection was based on though) in which i had the privilege of being in. once, when we were in middle of shiur, the freshmen were making a racket in the hallway and acting very childishly. He had a look of pride on his face as he looked upon us, the seniors, and said &quot;they are just babies, they will grow up, you were babies too&quot; then he froze for a good few seconds, cleared his throat and gave his signature chuckle. He took great pride in his students. 
another time, around 8 years ago, i was learning in a beis hamidrash in brooklyn and i saw a high school aged student learning there as well. i struck him up in conversation, turns out he went to ner yisrael and was kicked out by rav tendler for a silly thing he did , mind you rav tendler hardly ever kicked kids out, he just asked them to leave and after a week or two the kid was back in yeshiva, any way, this kids in the beis hamidrash learning, (looking up a rav moshe if i recall), he told me that he was going back to yeshiva next week and then he proceeded to complain about how rav tendler kicked him out and how he doesnt know what he is doing and yadayadayada. after a while i asked the kid &quot;what are you doing here in the beis right now, you dont have school for a week, go party!&quot; the kid looked at me and said &quot;that would be such a waste of a day&quot; . i guess rav tendler really did know what he was doing. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Despite your good intentions, you wrote it in a way that makes it sound that it was a such a chiddush that RT loved RYW&#039;s Torah. Thousands loved RYW&#039;s Torah beause he was a Gadol and had emes.

RYW was the one who hired RT by the way and  RYW was 10 years older. 

The main point is what you wrote can easily be taken as an insult to RYW. You should have been much more careful.

I am not unhinged. You made a mistake and you should correct it.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Joe691:

I appreciate your passion, but I am afraid you have misread what I wrote. I said that Rabbi Tendler was almost a peer of Rav Weinberg. Further, when Rabbi Tendler was hired, both RYW and RT were employed by the Yeshiva. They were colleagues. Third, the other talmidim of R&#039; Ahron who completely dismissed RYW&#039;s Torah, ahem, I am thinking of one particular Rosh Yeshiva, were not capable of adjusting their hashkafa or learning from RYW. This speaks to the gadlus of RT. That he was able to become a Talmid of a colleague of his who was maligned by RT&#039;s chevra at BMG is gadlus. Sorry.

To say that this is somehow mevazeh RYW makes you sound unhinged.

(Also, a couple of the maspidim made similar claims. Take it up with them too!)]]></description>

There were not &#039;practically peers.&#039; Rav Tendlet loved Rav Weinberg&#039;s Torah because it was emes and real, not because this was an example of his anivus. Rav Tendler was an anav but his loving Rav Weinberg&#039;s Torah is not an example of that. Please correct in the text (remove it).

		<description><![CDATA[A wonderful tribute.

I do have to correct one item. Rav Yaakov Weinberg was around 10 years older then Rav Tendler so I&#039;m not sure &#039;practically peers&#039; is an accurate statement. Rav Tendler loved Rav Weinberg&#039;s Torah because it was emes and real, not because he was working on his anivus by quoting Rav Weinberg. Rav Tendler was indeed an anav but his love for Rav Weinberg&#039;s Torah is not an example of it. ]]></description>
