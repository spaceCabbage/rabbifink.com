		<description><![CDATA[Nice pictures. One question: why offer any legitimacy, for those of us not in a chassidic community, for the &quot;custom&quot; of separate seating? We had only one wedding, ourselves. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes. Obviously beauty is in the eye of the beholder. But the NYT deemed these photos worthy of public consumption because they feel they are beautiful in at least one sense of the word. I agree.

I think most people who are outsiders to orthodox Judaism will see the photos for what they are: A peek inside a mysterious world as seen by a world class photographer. It sure looks better than the albums on Only Simchas...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I never like when we assume that what makes sense to us or seems beautiful to us (althoug this issue doesnt seem so at all to me) also seems so to outsiders. 

I think people viewing these photos would either be apathetic or wondering what the hell is wrong with every single person appearing in those pictures (and feeling bad for that bride as wel.)

Even with an explanation it isnt beautiful. ]]></description>

One of the starkest differences between orthodox Jews and others can be observed at a wedding. The orthodox Jewish wedding is really two weddings. One for the men and one for women. &lt;/i&gt;

Well ... I guess I&#039;m not orthodox in that case. We only had 1 wedding.]]></description>
