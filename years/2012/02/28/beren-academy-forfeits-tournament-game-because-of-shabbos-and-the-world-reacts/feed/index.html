		<description><![CDATA[see what my law school friend Matt commented on my FB posting of it. 

I agree that something like NCAA football isnt antisemetic since all games are played on sat. (except one or 2  a year played on a thursday night homecoming and whatnot).

but if they have a schedule and accommodating by moving a game a few hours means that a team doesnt have to quit, and you dont want to do it, you are being overly inflexible and is smacks of intolerance and borders on something more nefarious... ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[we had similar thing in highschool (out of town schools who play against non jewish schools not just &quot;yeshiva leagues&quot; like the schools in the NE) when our school had a game scheduled for yom tov.  We petitioned and the governing body rejected the petition.  we then explained to the very frum christian school that we would then need to forfeit the game.  the very frum chatholic school was appalled that the governing body was being so insensitive to the religious doctrine and informed the governing body that if the game wasnt moved, they would be forfeiting too, leaving no team available to advance.  the game was rescheduled and the goyim destroyed us....

but like one of the other commenters said here, its about insensitivity and disparate treatment/impact.  as you know from law school, thats discriminatory....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For once, Rav Fink, I&#039;m in total agreement with you. This isn&#039;t antisemitism, but it is insensitivity. I&#039;d guess it stems from an, &quot;if we pander to these people&#039;s quirks who knows what the next set of demands will be?&quot; attitude and I doubt if they see any dissonance between their &quot;no Sunday games&quot; rule and ignoring the religious needs of Jews.

Every now and then, Jews living in the (thank G-d) warm and tolerant environment of the United States need a reminder that we are not at home there, and are (at best) honored guests. We should appreciate the fact that the reminder comes in the form of an inconvenience and not something worse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Firstly, let me commend you for only using the word &quot;inspiring&quot; once. The second expression you used was &quot;heart warming&quot;. There are few words I hate more than &quot;inspire&quot; especially since it is so overused by the Charedi Iliterati. 

My general opinion on these matters is that if one chooses to keep certain laws or beliefs they must live with the consequences and difficulties that may be a byproduct of said beliefs. I know many people will claim this is a &quot;golus mentality&quot; type of outlook but I disagree. Yes, there is no reason why Jews shouls let themselves be stepped on any longer like they did for millenia, but I view this is pushing your beliefs on to others.

Forcing all the others kids to push off their tournament because of Shabbos is wrong, why should their schedule and  sports be interfered with because of the selected beliefs of a few. 

At the end, yes, its nice to see Shomer Shabbos boys being Shomer Shabbos and not participating in these games on Shabbos, but what else would they do? This is a school team, would you expect the school to gove the kids the option to play or not? I dont think so....]]></description>
