		<description><![CDATA[At this point, I would stop calling Zwiebel an apologist and call him an enabler.

He is making public statements that will make Haredi children more vulnerable to child abuse, and protect their abusers.

From what I gather, Rabbi Elyashiv did not say that someone needed to consult a rabbi before reporting abuse to authorities.  It was the Agudath Israel that came up with that toxic requirement.  They have continued to hold to that position, despite all the opposition, and have now painted themselves as martyrs.  If there is any concern for victims, it&#039;s sure not showing, nor is there any understanding of the child abuse investigation process.  At this point, that lack of understanding can&#039;t be considered mere ignorance - it&#039;s willful blindness.

		<description><![CDATA[Just to clarify, this is not a daily struggle, but there have been isolated incidents over 15+ years of sending our kids to day schools.  In general, I tend to err on the side of letting things slide rather than registering a complaint but in retrospect maybe we should have spoken up more.  One son felt his high school rebbe was promoting a kollel lifestyle, even in a &quot;Torah U&#039;mada&quot; type school.  We chose not to raise a stink and maybe we should have.  He was a teenager so we felt he understood this was not our hashkafa.  On the lighter side, another day school rebbe had a Chabad background and gave out coins blessed by the Rebbe.  Not my cup of tea but I was okay with our kids being exposed to different types of Orthodox Judaism. 


For the most part, I think the teachers know their audience and don&#039;t deliberately set the kids up for a home/school conflict.  I just wish there were more really dynamic and inspiring  MO rebbeim.
Rabbi Fink, I would welcome a separate post on this topic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two excerpts from the article that I found most striking: 

&lt;b&gt;The question is, if the fact that [bloggers have] created some degree of change is worth the cost. At the very least, it’s rechilus, lashon hara, and bittul zman. That’s a high price to pay.&lt;/b&gt;

Right - it&#039;s too high a price to pay in order to save the life of a child. With this one statement, Rabbi Zweibel has destroyed what little credibility the Agudath might have had left (and that wasn&#039;t much).

&lt;b&gt;&#039;Today,&#039; he beamed at me, &#039;is the reason that I joined Agudath Israel — precisely for the times that l understand things one way and they perceive it another way, and we follow them. That’s a good day.’&lt;/b&gt;

An educated adult completely surrendering his autonomy. It is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a &quot;good day&quot;. And he&#039;s &quot;beaming&quot;, yet. He obviously doesn&#039;t care about the cost in terms of human life. As long as his belief system is validated, as long as he can keep on furiously clutching that security blanket for a little while longer, like the child he is - that is all that matters. Abused children and their defenders, vilified as &quot;mosers&quot;, can go to hell, figuratively and literally.

Contemptible and pathetic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Charlie, the reason the parents put up with it is that for over half a century, the Modern Orthodox have been in thrall to the Haredim. We now have three generations of MO who have grown up hearing their parents tell them &quot;Our way is better, because we remain loyal to the tradition while not shying away from secular culture and education&quot;, yet seeing them glance furtively backward over their collective shoulder, longing for Haredi approval - an approval we all know they will never receive. This is one of the main reasons they have kids defecting to the right as well as to the left.

The result is that apart from a few fringe groups and individuals - Avi Weiss and his students, Shmuel Herzfeld, perhaps Rabbi Fink, although I don&#039;t know him and can&#039;t say - there is no more Modern Orthodoxy. Authentic, pre-war Modern Orthodoxy - the Orthodoxy of Rav Soloveitchik (not that he was a Liberal, by any means) - is dead. The Haredim killed it, and the Modern Orthodox helped them to dig the grave. All that is left now is Haredism and Haredism Lite.

It&#039;s very sad, and it isn&#039;t going to change. The Haredim are shooting themselves in their collective foot, and when they go, they&#039;ll be taking most of the Orthodox world with them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i think that the main point over here is that Torah requires leadership. Even if its weak, or sometimes incorrect, leadership, leadership is still required. 
Bloggers generally have half the information, very little of the scholarship, and none of the guidance, of the leaders of a given group, lets say Gedolei Yisroel. 
But the internet gives them an audience. The audience and the bloggers are more into democracy than Torah leadership as a model, dont realize that whilst they are right on a given issue, they are not following the Torah way on how to get their point across, and they do more harm than good. This is because, in the long run, the ignorant masses (me included) that they talk to, lose total respect for Torah leadership, due to the Bloggers talking about Gedolim only in the areas where they are doing something wrong. They dont talk about all the good, only the bad. That is why most bloggers blog from outside a system they either never belonged to, are in the process of leaving, or have left already.
Its similar to toppling American government because you disagree with a particular policy. You might accomplish a righting of a historical wrong, and that is important, but in the end, better a strong govermnment that makes mistakes, to no government at all


i guess this is what pre &quot;pnei kelev&quot; looks like. Right now, the tail (thats you guys) are trying to figure out how to wag the dog! I hope, for all of our sakes, that you fail]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In Modern Orthodoxy the concerns are nearly the same.  Only MO parents worry not not just about their children being pulled to the left but the right too.  The difference in attitude is that the MO parent&#039;s more worldly outlook has shown them that building our own Berlin wall won&#039;t help.  Plenty of MO kids &quot;frum out&quot; or go &quot;OTD&quot; - does that mean that MO lacks validity or were the parents just unable to convey their faith in their own ideology? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i have to agree...
many people who send their kids to right winged yeshivot including my own ended up having a &quot;ru-ach shtush&quot; go into their bodies for over 30 yrs and it hasn&#039;t left.

When the Yeshivot and the communities place value over minhagim and the subsequent fall-out of not toeing the line on these minhagim because of teenage angst or other reasons OVER the happiness and mental and emotional well being of their kids, then the dysfunction ensues. Kids rebel even more. When parents get embarrassed by things not crucial and halachic for that matter ie; son not wearing a hat to shul just one example, 
then  the cycle of dysfunction continues and may continue and deteriorate into eventual G-d forbid throwing off the entire religion. Throwing the baby out with the bathwater a favorite expression I&#039;ve been saying/using lately with all the Asifa hoopla, seems to be a big problem. By all involved. Sad. Very sad. And honestly my family is very connected to the Agudah and I&#039;m trying to figure out solutions myself. Rabbi Fink. We should talk. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not true. There are no rabbis in America who have the ability to investigate an abuse allegation, because they cannot compel witnesses to testify, they cannot force the collection of evidence, and they are not trusted by the courts to properly conduct such investigations.

Who do you think you are kidding, Eliyahu? You&#039;re afraid to name your so-called chareidi poskim because they don&#039;t exist. At least not in agreement with what you claim. Otherwise you could name them. But you refuse to. (I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll now give a &quot;good excuse&quot; why you can&#039;t name them.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@efink:disqus &lt;i&gt;Also parents can choose where to send their children to school. They can self select.&lt;/i&gt;



In theory yes. In practice, sometimes no. For example, outside of the NY area, there aren&#039;t many schools to choose from. And even in places where there are two elementary schools, there usually is only one high school. And sometimes, cost enters the equation and basically you choose your children&#039;s school based on what you can afford.


Even inside the NY area, there isn&#039;t always a plethora of hashkafically appropriate schools for everyone.

Look at it from the perspective of someone who is not the loving son of your father. Does that sound like the truth or that he is deflecting responsibility? What has he been teaching for the past 30 years? What will happen to him and all the rest, who you say are more moderate, if they simply don&#039;t allow the extremists to dictate to them? Seems to me that yeshivas know exactly how to say no to parents, as they do it all the time.]]></description>

What has he been teaching for the past 30 years? What will happen to him and all the rest, who you say are more moderate, if they simply don&#8217;t allow the extremists to dictate to them? Seems to me that yeshivas know exactly how to say no to parents, as they do it all the time.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re just a reverse apologist. 
I have no reason to doubt that the Aguda (aka Moetzes)&#039;s spokesman speaks for all its members. Yes, Aron Shecheter, Aron Feldman, et al as far as we are concerned agree with every imbecilic utterance spewed from Zweibel&#039;s mouth. Yaacov Perlow is personally more concerned with &quot;buttul zman&quot; (whatever that is) than he is with child molestation. 
Until they fire his lame ass that is the way it works. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I could have been more specific. I was not talking about the modern orthodox schools. I was talking about the more yeshivish schools and Bais Yaakovs.


Some of my evidence is a recent Hakirah article which you can read the first couple pages here: http://www.hakirah.org/Vol13Fried.pdf

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;
Similarly, most of the educators in our schools are not as extreme or unreasonable as the parents of the children in their schools. &quot;


I have to reject this argument, which is what the yeshivas claim to deflect responsibility from the fact that they are the ones spreading the gospel of extremism. No parents ever instructed their children to reject their family mimhagim, stay away from family simchas and numerous other things which come from the schools. And if some parents are extreme, where do you think these parents got it from? Their own chinuch as youngsters, courtesy of the yeshivas.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, I think you need to stop putting &quot;gedolim&quot; in capital letters. It perpetuates the notion that they are this lofty group of super rabbis whereas in fact the only thing that connects them is knowledge of gemara (they also usually share some sort of philosophical outlook depending on the organization granting them the &quot;gadol&quot; imprimatur.) Unfortunately we know that Torah knowledge in and of itself doesn&#039;t imply anything about one&#039;s ethical standards since we see time and time again that many of these same scholars are enablers of abuse and thievery and thus should be judged along with the criminals that they protect. Because they are often seen as being representative of the greatest that Orthodoxy has to offer, they share responsibility for the denigration of Orthodoxy in the eyes of other Jews as well as the ridicule of Judaism in the eyes of gentiles.]]></description>
