		<description><![CDATA[I think you are separating two things which are actually a unified whole. Mystics don&#039;t hold information back based on a lack of cognitive ability but rather based on ascetic practice. There is no fa&#039;heir to attend a shiur in Beit El, but no one will teach you anything if you are not a completely observant Jew. In short, Judaism does not separate information out as a separate category, which is what you seem to be implying in your post. 

As to Rebbi Yehuda and making information freely accessible, I would argue the exact opposite. Aggadic material is a way for the sages to encode philosophic and mystical material deemed inappropriate for the masses into a terse cryptic language decipherable only by the most brilliant minds. Furthermore the Mishna itself lists an injunction not to teach esoteric material in public (see Chagigah chapter 2). ]]></description>

The whole point of this film is to see what else is happening while the camera is focused on the quarterback. Were receivers open downfield? Why? Why not? What did the quarterback see?

		<description><![CDATA[Rationalism in religion is as much an esoteric doctrine as mysticism.


That said, the information thing is important. I pretty much guarantee that 30 years ago something as easy to find out online as the controversy over the Zohar&#039;s origin was entirely unknown to the vast majority of people with identical profiles of those, today, who are well aware of it. I once posted about what I called Semi-talmidei chachomim or semi-am haratzim ( http://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2007/01/semi-talmidei-hakhomim-or-semi-amei-ha.html ) as a unique, modern challenge to rabbinical authority. Just look at something like the Avodah list. There are accessible, constant discussions about the ins and outs and even history of halacha that were unthinkable not long ago. These can&#039;t help but have an effect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The difference between Maimonides view that only wise men should be given the keys to understanding the deepest concepts is that these people were not charged and did not take it upon themselves to institute new laws based on their knowledge. 


The point that Rabbi Fink is making is that the &quot;Kabbalists&quot; of the 13th and 14th century and beyond instituted new laws -- &quot;al pi Kabbalah&quot; -- that they introduced to the masses, thus making those not following these laws feel inferior and even marginalized. This ability gave the &quot;Kabbalists&quot; POWER over people 


The Maimonidean paradigm of transferring knowledge to a select few was not so they could wield power and invent new laws.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;anyone who was versed in science and Torah could learn it.&lt;/i&gt;
Hence, not available to the masses.   We could stipulate that the average day school educated H.S. graduate today would qualify and Maimonides was only excluding the more ignorant masses of his day, but I don&#039;t think this is clear.

We don&#039;t really know what Maimonides would consider well versed.   Hypothetically,he might have required yadin yadin semicha and a PhD equivalence in one of the natural sciences.   If so, that would limit its study to a very small group that invested years of study to be worthy. 

As an aside; When I was a teenager, I used to think that when I reached 40 (that&#039;s the age they told us was the minimum in yeshiva), the first thing I would want to do is pick up a book on the Zohar and start reading this secret knowledge.   As I come closer to that day now, I really have no interest, having reached the conclusion that the rational path is more constructive.

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting Post.   But problematic in that it would seem that even the rationalist Maimonides did not feel that all concepts of Torah and G-d should be readily accessible.

&lt;b&gt;Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah, Madah 2:12&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt; The Sages of the early generations commanded that these matters [Ma&#039;aseh Merkavah] should not be explained except to a single individual.  He should be a wise man, who can reach understanding with his knowledge.  In such an instance, he is given fundamental points, and an outline of the concepts and an outline of the concpepts is made known to him.... The concepts are extremely deep, and not everyone has knowledge to appreciate them....&lt;/i&gt;

Sounds awfully like kabbalah that is received wisdom that comes from great scholars and is imparted to great 
scholars only. It is not accessible to the masses as it is deemed too 
dangerous or too esoteric for the common people to grasp.

While I like your overall message, I don&#039;t think we can use Maimonides as an example of someone who felt all should be accessible to the masses.  ]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interesting Post.   But problematic in that it would seem that even the rationalist Maimonides did not feel that all concepts of Torah and G-d should be readily accessible.</p>
<p><b>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah, Madah 2:12</b>  <i> The Sages of the early generations commanded that these matters [Ma'aseh Merkavah] should not be explained except to a single individual.  He should be a wise man, who can reach understanding with his knowledge.  In such an instance, he is given fundamental points, and an outline of the concepts and an outline of the concpepts is made known to him&#8230;. The concepts are extremely deep, and not everyone has knowledge to appreciate them&#8230;.</i></p>
<p>Sounds awfully like kabbalah that is received wisdom that comes from great scholars and is imparted to great<br />
scholars only. It is not accessible to the masses as it is deemed too<br />
dangerous or too esoteric for the common people to grasp.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t think it could be done but you&#039;ve successfully compared the A22 video to the Mishneh Torah. Congratulations. (Now, if only &quot;Yad&quot; hachazakah had a gamatria of 11 or 22, instead of 14 - you&#039;d REALLY be on to something.)]]></description>
