		<description><![CDATA[That is a decision that a woman is free to make with her doctor.  If her employer is a religious institution with a sincerely held belief, the 1st amendment guarantees the free exercise of their religion.  Employers are not obligated to provide health care.  If a woman wants contraception, she can pay for it herself, get it cheaply from nonprofit organizations (like Planned Parenthood), or find a job with an employer who has no religious imperative to avoid providing contraception. 


 It is important that the Jewish people stand in solidarity with the Catholics on this issue.  San Francisco already tried to ban circumcision based on &quot;health care&quot;.  We don&#039;t want any precedent in US law which would allow such a ban to succeed, the next time someone tries to infringe on Jewish religious freedom.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[
Furthermore, you fail to get the distinction between same sex marriage contracts, which is indeed forbidden for non-Jews according to uncontested statements in the gemara, and employment discrimination against gays and Lesbians. There is absolutely no chiyuv to discriminate in employment. Indeed here is the antidiscrimination policy of my employer, Yeshiva University:

&quot;The University&#039;s policy is designed to insure that recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, and all other personnel actions take place, and all programs involving students, both academic and non-academic, are administered without regard to race, religion, creed, color, national origin, sex, age, disability, veteran or disabled veteran status, genetic predisposition/carrier status, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity or citizenship status as those terms are used in the law. In addition, this policy is designed to maintain a work and academic environment free of harassment and intimidation.&quot;

http://www.yu.edu/hr/diversity/

I would have voted for the NYC gay rights law. It was because of that NYC gay rights bill that the notorioius Plato&#039;s Retreat sex club was closed. Should it have been permitted to continue? 

Furthermore, it is a fact that we do not try to force the Noachide laws on non-Jews. Case in point: In 1788 the US Constitution was ratified. It contained a provision prohibiting any religious test for any public office in the federal government. It thus allowed idol worshipers to serve in any position, even President of the United States. Indeed many if not the majority of Orthodox Jews in America wil be voting for a candidate who practices a polytheistic religion for President of the United States this fall. Where is your outrage over this? 
This picking and choosing doesn&#039;t make us look very consistent.

when the 1980&#039;s NYC gay &quot;rights&quot; bill was being pushed R Moshe said we&#039;re mechuyuv to fight this with all our koach.

R Herschal schater said that same-gender &quot;marriage&quot; will &quot;destroy this country&quot;

R Twersky said in his famous drasha in Gluck that the reason for the YU forum is because people were pushing this rishus in both Albany and Trenton.

now that is CV passed in NY who knows how many people were effected.

there are only 2 types of Jews who aren&#039;t against TOAVIAH marriage, apikorsiem and/or Shotiem.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;There is no contradiction because religious beliefs can be the basis for exceptions to the law.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

The only exceptions I know of apply to religious institutions themselves and not the individual adherents.  For example, clearly an Orthodox Jewish shul can refuse to consider the a female applicant as rabbi.  A grey area might be a synagogue advertising a receptionist position as &quot;male applicants only&quot; on the basis that there may be times when the rabbi was alone with the receptionist.  They might have a tougher time defending that exception as the religion doesn&#039;t limit the position to a male only, it just might inconveniences the rabbi... but a synagogue could probably get away with it.   

However, I know of no exception that applies to an individual who affiliates with a particular faith.  For example, if you decided to open up a solo legal practice and ran the same ad for a male receptionist for the same reason, I don&#039;t think you would stand a chance if you were challenged.  Similarly, if you advertised the position to gentiles only because it might have certain advantages with regard to Shabbat, you could run into problems.  Of course you could circumvent the problem by limiting your advertising of the position to selective word of mouth but that&#039;s not the issue.  The issue is can you do it openly and legally.

Please provide an example of where an individual has an exemption on discrimination?

One more thing...  &quot;Third of all, the photographer could have given a million different reasons for not taking the job.&quot;.  Aren&#039;t you basically suggesting that people circumvent the law by lying.  Is that really what we want to encourage?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If the couple stipulated in the contract that they must have (not merely prefer) a male photog for the men&#039;s side, and a female for the women&#039;s side, then it becomes a condition of the job itself.  If the company doesn&#039;t fulfill that clause, they&#039;re in breach of contract.


This is part of the reason why frum weddings typically use frum photographers.  That, and because they already know how a frum wedding is set up.  Imagine if someone didn&#039;t take pictures of the tana&#039;im or ketubah signing, or the plate breaking, because they didn&#039;t realize that it&#039;s an important part of the whole ritual.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really? It&#039;s one man&#039;s polemic statement. If it was so universally held why is the first source for this idea a rabbi from the latter part of the Amoraic period. Don&#039;t worry so much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The courts generally have NOT allowed religious freedom exemptions from civil rights laws, as the Smith decision pointed out in the post points out, and earlier when Bob Jones University lost its tax exempt status because of racial discrimination. In another case, my own institution lost a case when we tried to prohibit same sex couples in a dorm. (It had a terrible case; we had accepted public funds to build the dorm!) This would appear to basically settled law. ]]></description>
