		<description><![CDATA[Leah, I think, and correct me if I&#039;m wrong, that the point R. Fink was making, is that all the frustration with  the frum world expressed on the blogs needs to be channeled into making a real positive change, as opposed to just ranting.  I don&#039;t think he meant that in ALL cases effort doesn&#039;t matter as much as result.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@efink:disqus &lt;i&gt;But in the end we are judged by man and by God based on what we have accomplished.&lt;/i&gt;



So, are you saying that in the end God judges a man who gave $1,000,000 to tzedaka more favorably than a man who gave $100,000?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry Rav Fink, but I absolutely disagree with you. This fascination with the end result is antithetical to  Torah and just goes to show how much we have absorbed American mentality without any critique. As best we try, we have no control over the final outcome of any of our actions. All we can control is our hishtadlut (Good job and good effort). Syata dishmaya is what bridges our efforts with results.  From &quot;Lo alecha hamelacha ligmor&quot; to the nikudat habechira of Rav Dessler Judaism is not about results, it&#039;s about the process. 


Actually, I have found that when people can take their eyes of the prize and just concentrate on the effort, the results are so much better.]]></description>

its like the line about prayer working. &quot;God answers all prayers. Sometimes, he just says &quot;No.&quot;


ours is to put forth our hishtadlus, hopefully we are successful. if not, we must still try...]]></description>
