		<description><![CDATA[Kol HaKavod to you and the men who came. The whole thing of labels such as &quot;orthodox&quot;, &quot;reform&quot;, &quot;OTD&quot;, etc, are unimportant. Torah does not contain such labels. All Jews want to fulfill mittzvot, but not all can at all times. Give enough Jews the opportunity make an ad hoc minyan, and you will eventually get enough, regardless. Just that sometimes more time and effort is required to find those willing and able.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting story. To be honest, I probably would have said no if you would have asked me - I&#039;m more lazy than nice. And I&#039;m &quot;ex-Orthodox&quot;, too. 


But I do agree with your theory: frum people often evaluate chessed in a halachic context, while secular people are less likely to judge the importance by any standard other than how much the recipient needs/wants it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[coming off of the reading of Ruth on Shavuos, this point is really important to publicize. Ruth is all about extralegal human decency and kindness, whether its Boaz trying to do yibum to keep his relative&#039;s name alive in a non-halachic context (and even with the fear of attack since marrying a moabite was forbidden until he was mechadesh that women would be excepted), Ruth&#039;s immense kindness to Naami without any halachic requirements, her extra special level of tznius that was not required, Boaz&#039;s kindness to have his workers intentionally leave extra wheat for poor people, Ploni Almoni&#039;s unwillingness to take in Ruth (who really needed someone, and would otherwise be shunned by all Jews if Boaz didn&#039;t stand up and make a controversial/non-halachic decision). 
And most clearly, we see the punishment for Elimelech, who chooses to leave his people (according to the Midrash, it was halachically justified to leave during a famine) at a time they needed him most.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to burst your bubble!!! As romantic and touchy it feels, we can&#039;t tamper with Halacha!! We all know that a מחלל שבת is a עכו״ם לכל דבר you can&#039;t be them מצרף to minyan! So as romantic as it felt, not only didn&#039;t you have a minyan, you were עובר on being מוציא שם שמים in vain and that a pretty big sin, and no טובה for the נשמה!! 

I know that you&#039;ll take out the שמה הרהר תשובה בלבו card but we all know that it ain&#039;t so!!! 

This is what yiddeshkiet comes to when the Internet Facebook rabbis come I. The picture!!

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with your assessment.  In my &quot;frum&quot; days I would often make similar decisions.  For example: some of my traditional (but not &quot;frum&quot;) relatives enjoyed singing the bentching out loud at the Shabbos table, but would only feel comfortable if my family and I would join them.  Since it wasn&#039;t a &quot;frum&quot; thing to and it wasn&#039;t halachicly required, I rarely accommodated them.  And it didn&#039;t require a five hour trip to Long Island to do so.

		<description><![CDATA[Two observations.


1) Isn&#039;t comforting the mourner part of halacha, regardless of whether it&#039;s the unveiling or the funeral?  If a body could not be recovered, would these Orthodox Jews attend a memorial service?


2) Why is everyone needing to travel out to Long Island and back?  Aren&#039;t there Jewish men living there?  If I had been in your shoes, I would have called synagogues in nearby towns.  Knowing me, I&#039;d have called Conservative and Reform congregations as well.]]></description>

In general, on a weekday, most people are busy working and to travel out to Long Island and back would require taking off almost the entire day. Most people, no matter how charitable, aren&#039;t willing to do that. Especially when vacation days are at a huge premium due to so many chagim coming out on weekdays this decade. People who aren&#039;t working, or people who work in flexible jobs, or people who work nearby, are the ones most likely to respond to such a request.]]></description>
