If they learned of a serious environmental hazard in their kids&#039; 
school would they sit quietly too, or would they demand action 
internally, even if they never would go to the board of health?&lt;/i&gt;


Of course they&#039;d sit quietly. That&#039;s the problem - they&#039;re the collective end result of generations of programming designed to eradicate personal autonomy. They&#039;ve been brought up in environments in which it&#039;s been drilled into them, from early childhood, that they aren&#039;t allowed to make any important decisions without consulting their rabbis, who are to be obeyed in all matters, religious and secular. Disobeying a rabbi, even questioning his authority is enough to buy you a one-way ticket to gehinnom.


There&#039;s also a growing body of evidence that is strongly suggestive of a neurological foundation for fundamentalism, one of the main hallmarks of which is authoritarianism, the need to see reality in terms of rigidly defined structures of authority and to invest an inordinate amount of faith in an authority figure. If there is merit to this, and I think there is, it&#039;s reasonable to assume ti&#039;s genetic, especially when one considers their largely closed gene pool.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Mark&#039;s right. Who&#039;s going to be talking about this? Not the victims. Certainly not the perpetrators. So if someone isn&#039;t directly involved, how would he know? I think it is true in general, and much more true in haredi communities, that people do not lightly gossip about things like sexual abuse. Amongst haredim - at least in my experience - people do not even like to admit or talk about more minor problems, such as kids having problems in school, or behaving badly, or being caught with a Smart Phone - to sit and listen to small talk, you would think that every kid is a perfect tzadik, every family is a model family with a storybook marriage, etc. Kal v&#039;chomer, people are certainly not going to be shmuzing about child abuse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In your earlier article, you wrote:

&quot;This does not give the DA a pass for not prosecuting cases from the community that should be prosecuted. But I think it goes to show just how difficult such prosecutions would be without the cooperation of witnesses and victims. The problem here is not the DA.&quot;

But if Hynes really has been unduly lax in prosecuting Chareidi abusers (and especially if he has prevented witnesses from testifying as indicated by the Jewish week article I cited earlier) then he is also causing future witnesses to be less likely to come forward. Since they know Hynes&#039; track record, they won&#039;t bother to go through the pain of coming forward.


Thus, your claim that &quot;the problem here is not the DA&quot; would be incorrect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t say it doesn&#039;t exist in the Litvish world, or for that matter the MO world.  I was just pondering whether the horrific numbers being spoken about are limited to the the chasidic chareidim, or chareidim in general?    (The reports keep saying &quot;Chasidic&quot;, and I do wonder if it&#039;s specific to the Chasidic community or if people have just been incorrectly using the term chassidic as synonymous with charedi, but suspect it&#039;s more likely referring to chassidim.)  

The yeshiva world is a bit less insular, and even attract a limited number of children from MO homes where they are less able to control and influence parents.   Therefore, it would stand to reason that their numbers would be more normative.   e.g. Ner Israel, Rabbi FInk&#039;s alma mater, probably couldn&#039;t cover up wide spread abuse for years the way a Brooklyn school ,whose population was mostly native to the neighborhood, because they could not exert that kind of control over their parent body.  

That said, the Rosh HaYeshiva of Ner Israel is a member of the Moetzes.  - Rabbi Fink, have you ever sought an audience with him on your visits to the region to ask what he&#039;s doing about this problem as a member of the Moetzes?

		<description><![CDATA[I watched the clip.


Is recognition of long term consequences needed  for parents to take action?  Isn&#039;t it enough that your child is being hurt presently and on an ongoing basis?
If the problem is as large as the figures recently put forward say, then I would have expected that parents would be lining up outside the rebbe&#039;s door demanding action by now.   It&#039;s unbelievable (to me) that it could be so wide-spread and each parent thinks it&#039;s just their kid. 


Do they just feel so completely helpless as parents to look out for their kids&#039; well being?


If they learned of a serious environmental hazard in their kids&#039; school would they sit quietly too, or would they demand action internally, even if they never would go to the board of health?    


I&#039;m not saying it&#039;s not true, just that I find it shocking.  You figure if you&#039;ve read about 100 cases there must exist 500 cases, but if that&#039;s from a pool of tens of thousands of kids over the years, then you can conclude that it&#039;s a couple percent who are abused.   Easy enough for administrators to dismiss two out of 100 parents.   But, when you hear it&#039;s 30 out of hundred, and you figure in any one year school administrators should be hearing from tens of parents, then something more would have to have been done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When we speak of the chasidic community, it&#039;s usually to the exclusion of the Chareidi Yeshivish community - correct?

If the prevalence of abuse is mainly in the chasidic community and not as much in the misnagid yeshivish communities, then the only hope for change from the inside is with the non-chasidish chareidi community.   It&#039;s hard to see your own faults, but I would think that the non-chasidic chareidim would be as outraged as we are.

The non-chassidic portion of Agudah needs to convince their Chassidic bed-mates that they must weed out the bad seeds and take this problem seriously.  They are the only  group that has any meaningful link to them.  Most chassidim don&#039;t really care about what those of us in the Internet think of them. 

If you have a connection with any of the Moetzes (e.g. You live near them and can talk to them, or you donate money via Mishulach for their yeshiva) let them know that the MO world will not tolerate their acceptance of this behavior and until there is a change on policy vis-a-vis reporting abuse and support for victims and their families there will be no support from us.  They need to become persona non grata, their Torah deemed batul, their words hevel in our communities, and their yeshivas/tzedakos blacklisted. 

That&#039;s all we in the MO world can do... blogging alone won&#039;t accomplish anything.  If the MO world has the guts to do that, it can accomplish a lot, but if we can&#039;t stand up for ourselves and the values we hold dear, don&#039;t expect the yeshivish rebbes to stand up to the chassidish rebbes either.]]></description>

<p>If you have a connection with any of the Moetzes (e.g. You live near them and can talk to them, or you donate money via Mishulach for their yeshiva) let them know that the MO world will not tolerate their acceptance of this behavior and until there is a change on policy vis-a-vis reporting abuse and support for victims and their families there will be no support from us.  They need to become persona non grata, their Torah deemed batul, their words hevel in our communities, and their yeshivas/tzedakos blacklisted. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s all we in the MO world can do&#8230; blogging alone won&#8217;t accomplish anything.  If the MO world has the guts to do that, it can accomplish a lot, but if we can&#8217;t stand up for ourselves and the values we hold dear, don&#8217;t expect the yeshivish rebbes to stand up to the chassidish rebbes either.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[1 in 50 would be an incredibly high number.  How can we fathom it is 1 in 5???  Is there anything to support that?  20% would be beyond being a crisis -- such that even in such an insular community, it would seem impossible to cover up for so long.


Is anyone questioning this number -- or is that besides the point in this discussion?]]></description>

I honestly believe that Hynes is not “protecting abusers” for the sake of votes. &quot;

Why, because he says so? With all due respect, you don&#039;t live here. Hynes thought he was doing exactly what the frum community wanted him to do all these years. There&#039;s no way for a goy to know what the sea of penguins without individual personalities want, apart for what the rabbonim and askonim tell them. What a rude awakening for him to discover that 


a) the frum community may not really support what its leaders were telling him that they want, and
b) that whatever Orthodox Jews really want, it was going to look horrible to everyone else when it got out.


And the guy likes and needs getting elected. So of course he was doing it for the votes, just as he is partially reversing himself to get out of the hole he finds himself in. ]]></description>
