		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re under-estimating Hatred against Jews and Judaism across the planet. It seems you are more wanting to gain the respect of the liberal community, as opposed to stand up in defense of Jewish values, that are ultimately all-encompassing, and all embracing. By the cerebral sounds of it, its apparent you disregard the level of the tragedy in losing Jewish lives. You are taking the stance of &quot;homosexuals, gypsies and Jews&quot; were killed by Nazis, when its fact that among minority hatred, its the Jew that is the prize of them all. Don&#039;t fall for the disguise, for camouflage, for deceitfulness. There is a war against Jews and Judaism. Fight the war against evil. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By over indulging on whether or not this act was a targeted anti-semitic or minority-group attack greatly misses the point that innocent people have been viciously killed, and among them, Jewish Orthodox. The attack on Mumbai and the near-by Chabad house was of greater proportions, cross-cultural, more people slaughtered, but undeniably an act of anti-semitism on the Holtzbergs. You can even say that the accompanying variables of other cultures are summed up in the attack on the Jews, the prize of all the other surrounding variables, that is because of the nature of Jews as a cross-global unified phenomena. The point is, as Frum Jews, observant of G-ds mitzos, and who are committed to the belief that we have been granted a special mission on this planet, this attack (despite its naturally confused motives), was an attack on Torah, and on living Jewish observance today. i.e. We must increase our mitzvos, our light, and indeed put an end to ALL hatred, and influence ALL of humanity to return to the source of all life as deemed appropriate.     ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi,
When you hear hoofbeats, you think horses, not zebras, right?  Well, in France, if you pick four people at random, they&#039;re generally not Jews.  To say that anti-Semitism is not likely is, well, so overly idealistic that it&#039;s hard to put words to describe it.

Now that the gunman has been captured, and we find that he&#039;s part of a notoriously and anti-Semitic religion, we can say without fear of contradiction that he committed his heinous murders because he hates Jews.  Plain and simple.

As to your other point, I would personally love to see his limbs ripped off on the rack.  What compassionate person wouldn&#039;t want to see the murderer of children and innocents treated any other way?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ I stand corrected &quot;Likely&quot; conclusion-   latest data- possibly two separate shooters both wearing mini- cameras. Looks like contract killings- My personal theory- Iran has motive- Israel has been assasinating their nuclear scientists effectively and on motorcycle for the last few years.
In either case the neo- nazi theory does not rule out anti-semitism obviously. However the fact that the French soldiers had served in Afghanistan leadsme to believe  to a Muslim group outing their Muslim comrades for being traitors to Islam. We shall soon find out I hope...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Mourning Responsibly&quot;. You have no right to write this article now. Yes, you&#039;re very high-minded. You also happen to not know anyone involved and live half a world a way from a place where violent antisemitism is a real concern.

&lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; paragraph is cringeworthy: &quot;In the meantime, let us mourn responsibly. Let us mourn these deaths as 
one. We are in a deep collective pain. Let us channel that pain to 
improving the world and increasing love and kindness in the world to 
properly avenge the death of our brothers and sister in France.&quot;
Sounds like using real people&#039;s death to promote your own agenda. I&#039;m sorry if this comes off overly harsh, and I generally like your stuff, but you&#039;re not the first person to do this kind of thing, and it&#039;s offensive and frustrating for me to see over and over.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m no history expert, but I believe Av HaRachamim was composed specifically in response to the murder of (German) Jews during the 1st crusade and not composed as abstract poetry. 

So it seems that what you&#039;re saying is that once enough time passed that people forgot what it&#039;s about and it became so integrated into the liturgy that most people say it by rote, without any real thought or feeling behind it, it&#039;s okay to keep saying it. 

In your recent post on abhorrent beliefs you your focused on topics that were more theoretical (e.g. Amalek) but in this case, I am suggesting that if you find the sentiments widely expressed by Orthodox Jews of G-d avenging death as abhorrent, then it&#039;s root may likely be our liturgy.  I propose the root source of the statement you find cringeworthy (&quot;may God avenge their blood”) is our liturgy, and the abstract becomes tangible in these moments of terrible tragedy.

It&#039;s not just Av HaRachamim, of course.  We say it at the end of Avinu Malkeinu.  Ma&#039;oz Tzur&#039;s is commonly published with a 6th stanza &quot;Nikom Nikmat Dam Avadecha&quot;.   On Pesach, after the meal, we make a slightly different request but Shifoch Chamatcha has some of the same sentiments.   Unlike many of the other abhorrent beliefs that our vestiges of a different time, this one seem like it&#039;s still very much a part of us and the remarks you saw online are just the outward manifestation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[while  not all the facts are in,  the obvious conclusion is that the shooter was an Islamist attacking French troops for their having serving in Afghanistan or perhaps North Africa, or for the French government&#039;s having had the audacity to ban the Burka . The targeting of Jewish civilians has always been the M.O. for Islamic terrorists, whether in Israel , Munich or for example in the Argentinian Israeli embassy bombings of 1994 (planned by Iran) . Whatever military enemies that exist on the target list of the Islamic Supremacists,  Jews have always been the first prize for targeting- especially civilians. What was unique in the 9/11 horror was that the western world was elevated to a higher status for killing- just t as as high as the Jews.

It seems to me that the sentiment you cringe at is confirmed in our shuls nearly every week, and that&#039;s probably why it&#039;s a common sentiment among many Jews.Would you go so far as to abolish the custom of saying it in your shul?  (It&#039;s not like omitting a prayer that disagrees with &quot;modern sensibilities&quot; is without precedent - just look at what happened to &quot;Hanoten Teshua Lamelachim&quot; in the right wing  orthodox world.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;But anti-Semitism cannot be presumed in any and every instance where Jewish people are killed. There may turn out to be anti-Semitism in this case. But at this point, I can’t see how that can be assumed.&quot; Why not? Statistics dictate that of the thousands of schools in Toulouse the fact that the terrorists chose to attack a Jewish school, of which there are only a few in France, was not a random decision. It can safely be assumed that statistically this Jewish school was targeted. Was it random? Perhaps, but in all likelihood it was not. Statistically speaking.  Why is it that you seem to be eager to sympathize with the Muslims (i.e. in the Tapps article) (that is not to say that there is anything wrong with that)  yet at the same time you seem eager to say a statistically unlikely attack on a Jewish school was not anti-semitism.

 there is no evidence of ant-Semitism.&lt;/i&gt;

I agree that there is no evidence, however probability is very high that it is indeed the case. This is because there are perhaps a few hundred schools in the Toulouse metro area (over a million people) and the particular school chosen was the Jewish one (maybe the only Jewish one, or certainly one of the very few Jewish ones).

&lt;i&gt;slightly cringeworthy&lt;/i&gt;

For those who oppose the death penalty, it is their creed, is it not? (to have God administer the ultimate punishment rather than for mankind to administer it) So not cringeworthy at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi, the blood referred to in &quot;Hashem yinkom damam&quot; is the blood of the victims, spilled by the murderer, not any blood we wish to see spilled. Further by saying that, it is our wish that G-d should punish the murderer as He sees fit, not a desire to take things into our own hands. There&#039;s nothing wrong with wishing this, particularly once the murderer is caught. It doesn&#039;t make *us* bloodthirsty.]]></description>
