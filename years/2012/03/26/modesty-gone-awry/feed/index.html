		<description><![CDATA[Excellent point. I wrote the modesty and pants rant above, but on the subject of modesty and eating disorders, my two cents: I had anorexia on and off throughout middle school and high school, and my motivation to be thin came straight from MTV and pics of stick thin models in teen magazines (Seventeen, Elle, etc..). A group of girls might all agree that super skinny is attractive and long to look that way, but only a few will be able to starve their bodies into submission and spiral out of control- that&#039;s the neurological and OCD part at play. So I agree that the brain is the ultimate vehicle, but cultural phenomenon can definitely trigger it and get the wheels moving. For me, modesty and focus on spirituality helped cure me by taking away the motivation for the ED (even during those years my weight loss would peak in the summer and retreat during the school year; it just felt wrong to obsess so much about calories and my body while in a religious environment focused on spiritual growth), but the elements of perfectionism and OCD will be always be a part of my personality, just have to keep them in check and channel them to my advantage.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a designer and a mother, I realized that my daughter and many like her want to be &quot;cool&quot; and still be modest. However, finding this mix was a challenge especially in the category for church, temple or special events. I therefore created a new clothing line to meet this specific need called Michaela-Noel. Available on line at www.michaela-noel.com 
We cannot expect our kids to live in a previous century. They would be attracting attention by doing that as well and they would be subject to ridicule which in turn could lead to low self esteem, OCD and eating disorders. Is that the path we would want for them? Being Fashionable and Modest at the same time IS POSSIBLE and a realistic goal!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am Catholic, but I was raised by non-religious parents, and I dressed according to &quot;what was in fashion.&quot; I had anorexia nervosa between the ages of 12 and 18. I systematically starved myself and exercised excessively. I did not get my period for five years. I agree with Agouradeb. My anorexia was definitely related to my OCD, and my OCD is neurological, not cultural. (I take Luvox now--a lifesaver!)

Did cultural factors play a role? Sure. Among other things, I had a very controlling mother, and the only way I could successfully assert myself against her control was by refusing to eat. 

Nonetheless, I do think the point of this post is well taken. Those Branham folks sound as if they have flipped their ever-loving lids.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The premise that teachings of modesty &quot;gave her an eating disorder&quot; doesn&#039;t hold up. Eating disorders are widespread, and tend to be most prevalent, in fact, in cultures in which immodesty of dress is the norm. 

They are caused by a combination of psychological factors; there is no evidence that modest dress codes are a predisposing factor. Even the underlying attitude described as the animus behind Branhamism&#039;s modesty codes, is one that is found in other cultures (Islam, for example), and has not been found to correlate with eating disorders.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article. Thank you for not shying away from the more difficult issues, Rabbi Fink.  I really appreciated that little bit on women wearing pants, as it&#039;s an issue I think about a lot. Here&#039;s an idea- YOU become the rabbi of our times to de-stigmatize it! Look, I&#039;m half kidding, because I agree with you that there would be an uproar and shouts about charem and op-eds about the sanctity of skirts, etc, etc. And yet, we do need bold leadership who can say what needs to be said and not be an intimidated. Look, I grew up more modern, always wore pants as a kid, but stopped in my pre-teen years since I went to a Bais Yaakov school. Never had a problem with a skirts-only approach until I got married and started having kids. I spend my days squatting to pick up babies and change diapers; I like to sit on the grass with my kiddos and play in the park with them. And you know what? I&#039;ve realized that skirts are just an impractical form of clothing. I&#039;m always worried about flashing people. There&#039;s a reason why 99% of women you&#039;ll see at the grocery store are wearing pants- because they make sense. They&#039;re comfortable, they give you full coverage, warmth in the winter, they keep your legs from rubbing against each other in the summer, etc. I just can&#039;t accept anymore this blanket notion that pants are &quot;not tznius.&quot; It&#039;s not true. Circular reasoning at work: they&#039;re not tzius because frum girls don&#039;t wear them...because they&#039;re not tznius....because frum girls don&#039;t wear them. Skirts only, all the time is archaic. Still, I don&#039;t have the nerve to walk out of my house in loose capris since I know I&#039;ll be branded not frum in everyone&#039;s eyes and that&#039;s a social stigma I&#039;m not willing to risk, at least not right now. Maybe one day I will, and then someone else will and then someone else and perhaps by the time my little girls are women a quiet revolution will have taken place.  Pains me to see little girls from very yeshivish families wearing skirts only at age 3, 4 and 5 already having to tuck their skirts between their legs every time they go down a slide, or else flash their underwear at everyone. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a therapist who treats eating disorders, I especially appreciate you pointing out the dangers of culturally and religiously imposed expectations that support unhealthy and disordered behaviors.  The orthodox community is not at all immune to eating disorders. Unfortunately the problem is pervasive enough that fortunately one of the leading treatment centers in the field has a program specifically for orthodox Jewish women.

However, there is a difference between disordered eating and eating disorders.  &quot;Preparing&quot; to date in the orthodox Jewish world encourages and supports disordered eating in the form of extreme dieting and exercising. This is not an eating disorder, though it can look like one at the time.

Professionally speaking, it would be much, much better and more effective for young women who feel that they need to lose weight to see a Registered Dietician--those who are trained to provide meal plans to help treat medical conditions (not a &#039;nutritionist&#039; who might have an online certificate) or attend Weight Watchers in order to be at their most fit and confident before dating for shidduchim.  

Eating disorders, however, are medical conditions that are not caused by religion or culture or even family dynamics.  They pre-exist as neurological potentials that are triggered by stress (of religious, cultural and familial expectations, etc.).  And as medical conditions they require medical treatment.  Eating disorders can appear at any age (as young as 7 years old) and strike men as well as women  (10-15% of those with eating disorders are male) and effect up to 24 million people in the U.S.  

Sadly, eating disorders can be fatal.  Of all of the neurological disorders, eating disorders have the highest mortality rate.  Families and friends of those who are suffering cannot afford to look the other way. Neurological disorders are not cured, but they can be managed into more or less permanent remission.  Those with eating disorders need appropriate treatment to recover.

I recommend the National Eating Disorder Association (NEDA) and Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD) websites for more information and referrals for treatment.
