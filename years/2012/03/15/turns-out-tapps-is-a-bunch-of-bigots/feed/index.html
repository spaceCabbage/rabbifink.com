		<description><![CDATA[Even by the standards of Texas that is truly horrifying.Â The worst part is they&#039;re taking it out on KIDS. If you really want to preach tolerance amongst all towards all, then a great way to start is by letting kids play sports with each other - maybe they&#039;ll learn that the other guy really isn&#039;t such a bad guy after all. It&#039;s easy to demonize what you don&#039;t know and can&#039;t see. Keeping a minority group separate is a great way to breed more hate and bias, not fight it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;or go away.
Isn&#039;t their league? :-) Frankly, let them have their own Christian league. Jews and Muslims should simply say &quot;You don&#039;t want us? Fine, we don&#039;t want you either&quot;

You know, maybe they should start vetting Jewish doctrine as well. Our religion has a lot of bad things in it against non-Jews as well (which was your point). I guess they don&#039;t know that.Â ]]></description>
