		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t claim anything. R&#039; Tendler had a tremendous impact on me. There is no doubt about it. I am certain that he did not think highly of any secular media. But then again, he also understood that his purity was not the standard for everyone else. 
I don&#039;t pretend to be anything. I spoke in a yeshiva so I spoke in a way that they would appreciate. As you can see from the photo, I was not wearing a hat (I don&#039;t even have one).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you claim to be following in R&#039; Tendler&#039;s mehalech?  I heard his shmuessen for a whole year and based on your posts you seem to reject his mehalech.  For example, I am pretty sure Rabbi Tendler was categorically opposed to any tv watching, and you seem to have no problem with tv.  
Do you pretend to still be yeshivish when you are among the yeshivish?
I don&#039;t necessarily agree with Rabbi Tendler over you, but I just think you should be real and stop being פסח על שתי הסעיפים.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you allowed to disagree? You are asking it in a funny way. You should be asking &quot;do I need to listen to the gadol&#039;s advice?&quot; 
And the answer to that is probably &quot;no&quot;. I might be wise to listen. It may be the better decision, but you have no violated any law in the Torah by not listening. 
Also, the context I am speaking about is primarily when a piece of paper with a new issur or something is signed by some gedolim and it say &quot;daas Torah&quot; as if that is a reason I need to listen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ok fair enough but lets say I&#039;m going to a gadol who i trust and i know hes a gadol betorah AND very familiar with whatever question I&#039;m posing him with. am i still allowed to disagree? (isnt there an explicit pasuk in the torah that says if a gadol tells you to go to the left then DONT go to the right. And if you look at rav dessler is his first chelek, he has a piece on emunas chachomim and he says that this is lesson and theme of purim to listen to our gedolim!) ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One always needs to know their limitations. I will illustrate with an extreme example. I am almost finished with law school. If you would ask R&#039; Chaim Kanievsky a question about American legal jurisprudence he might be able to guess or have a good idea about what the answer to you question would be. But you would be much better off asking a legal expert. I certainly know more about law than R&#039; Elyashiv and R&#039; Chaim combined. Right? 
So, when asking a question that they do not have first hand expertise, one should consider their ideas, but it seems unlikely that one MUST listen to them in that situation. 
There are grayer areas of course. I am just providing the framework. Specific issue should be resolved on a specific basis. 
You asked about getting guidance in life. That is a very gray area. And asking several gedolim would likely result in several answers. What would you do then? And the question is not whether one should listen to a gadol. The question is whether one &quot;must&quot; listen to a gadol.

Are you saying that i with very limited knowledge could disagree with him?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[








Thank you. I appreciate it.



To further clarify daas Torah: There is a new version of daas Torah that is not what we being referred to by Rabbi Tendler. I know he was not referring to the new version because we talked many times about the concept.

The new version holds that there a select few people who possess daas Torah. It is akin to nevuah, sometimes it is called ruach hakodesh, and it implies that the one who speaks with daas Torah cannot be mistaken about what he is speaking.

Rabbi Tendler, and all my rebbeim in Ner Yisrael believed that studying Torah with intensity had the ability to help mold one&#039;s mind into a mind that could think in the way that the Torah &quot;thinks&quot;. This kind of daas Torah is accessible to anyone who learns well and more importantly does not imply that the one speaking is incapable of being mistaken.

You asked: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Is rav elyashiv and rav chaim kanievsky daas torah?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;

A person cannot &quot;be&quot; daas Torah. Using the &quot;old&quot; definition, these great Torah scholars certainly possess a keen intellect that is very useful and helpful when one needs advice. But it does not make them incapable of error, nor does it mean that they will be helpful in situations where they have no expertise. It also does not mean that if they make a proclamation one is obligated to keep their proclamation.

		<description><![CDATA[The version of daas Torah I hear about more and more is basically rabbinic infallibility. That is, a rabbi says something and that makes it so. Only a select few have this imprimatur and once they do, their words are impeachable. According to Rabbi Tendler, everyone who learns well has some daas Torah in them. And just because you have it, that doesn&#039;t mean you won&#039;t make a mistake.]]></description>
