		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve just watched the video..... His meaning is clearly being twisted and taken out of context. If you listen to what he actually says, which I doubt religious people will bother to do, you will hear him saying &quot;If people seriously tell you that these things happened by stating it as fact, then you can mock them, ridicule them. Even in public, don&#039;t fall for the convention that we should be too polite to talk about religion, religion is not off the table, its not off limits. Religion makes specific claims about the universe, which need to be substantiated, which needs to be challenged, and IF NECESSARY, need to be ridiculed with contempt.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[And when religious people get in your face saying God will do this or God will do that is pure speculation.


Incidently, I get the impression from people on these threads that religion and science are being compared on par with each other when speaking of beliefs. The difference between religion and science is science is based on factual evidence that can be and has been corroborated, and will more easily be so as time goes on because science is always being updated as new knowledge is discovered. The bible on the other hand is just the same old nonsense which prevented science expansion for over a thousand years because all the answers to where we came from etc are (supposedly) in scripture.



Nowadays, as religion has evolved, (Thats a fact) science is being used by some religions as pseudo proof of Gods existence and even that is laughable. The bible is a crock of shit. How people cant see that is beyond me.... Oh wait no it isn&#039;t, it is because atheists (strong atheists) usually know more about religion than religious people. I have read more verses out of the bible than some dedicated Jehovahs witnesses I know. Religious people are usually ignorant of other religions. They generally accept that the religion of which they are born into is the correct one. 


It&#039;s suprising how ignorant some believers are about what is contained in the bible. A lot don&#039;t have a clue and if they did, and they weren&#039;t stupid, they would become atheists too. Religious organisations cherry pick some good bits and teach others an interpretation of the bible which is somebody elses. Best thing to do is not listen to them, and read the bible yourself and make up your OWN MIND. (Something religious people struggle with - being able to think for themselves)


Also the thing with science is when something is proven wrong, then it is definately accepted to be the new truth. When ever I am wrong, I admit it quickly and emphatically. If I met God after I die, I would sooner change my mind about God&#039;s existence and I would hope then that he judges me favourably for living a moralistic life without fear of punishment or promise of reward; because that is what I would expect from a &#039;Just&#039; God.


And if the only reason religious people are good is because they may go to heaven or otherwise hell, then does that mean you would be bad if it werent for religion? If so then YOU are the sort of people that should stay religious because you can&#039;t be trusted otherwise, and that is the reason you would think if we were all atheists then we&#039;d all be criminals! Which is another fallacy.


Oh and btw, EVERYBODY is born an atheist. Don&#039;t even get me started on indoctrinating children, which is immoral in my book.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you are missing the point. It&#039;s not about randomly going up to people and ridiculing them because of their religion. It would only apply when engaging in discussion about religion. E.g. If someone tried telling me I will go to hell for being a homosexual I would laugh in their face and retort with a few truths about the bible, such as how inconsistent, contradictory and ambiguous it is, or how far fetched the story of creation etc is, which quite frankly is laughable, an involuntary reaction to certain stimuli. As an atheist I just find bullshit bible stories funny, especially when people belive that bullshit. Better I retort in a wittily and incisive manner than respond with anger, don&#039;t you think?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And with pickets in America holding signs mocking homosexuals and atheists, is a bit hypocritical to say the least. If you want equality then atheists should be free to ridicule with contempt also. It annoys me that when someone says there is no God, religious people take offense, whereas when religious people say there is a God, that is ok. Again, hypocrisy right there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How can you not mock religion!? It&#039;s all a load of rubbish! It&#039;s plain weird hogwash. Totally outdated to how society has evolved. Religion is a BELIEF. Too many religious people they talk about it presupposing that it is true. Anyone that talks to me about religion as if it is true deserves to be mocked. However if they were to talk in terms of what they believe is this or that then I can respect that, however I will unashamedly and guiltlessly express my views to the contrary, and I can assert that what I say is true because it is. It&#039;s science VS religion. I really think it depends on how religious beliefs are communicated to others whether they deserve to be ridiculed.]]></description>

Well, if they didn&#039;t have, swords, bows and horses technology then....
&#062;Besides, Hitler and Stalin were religious, too, they just followed relgions called &quot;Nazism&quot; and &quot;Communism.&quot;I love how atheists broaden the term for religions when it comes to people like Stalin, Mao, Pot Po and Hitler. ]]></description>

&gt;Besides, Hitler and Stalin were religious, too, they just followed relgions called &#8220;Nazism&#8221; and &#8220;Communism.&#8221;I love how atheists broaden the term for religions when it comes to people like Stalin, Mao, Pot Po and Hitler. </p>

Sigh. But HE does. I am talking about HIM and HIS supporters. Therefore HE is being reasonable based on his a priori values. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But just because one only believes in science, does not mean that he will necessarily believe that religion is destroying the world.  I know people who are hard core atheists theologically, but practically, feel that in certain ways religion provides the best incentive for the average person to live ethically (don&#039;t steal, don&#039;t murder, etc.).

I wouldn&#039;t have said anything if you would have suggested that Dawkins&#039;s latest is reasonable since he feels that religion is ruining the world.  But you stated that it was a reasonable conclusion for someone who only believes in science and I just don&#039;t agree anymore than if someone would say that because Muslims feel that non-muslims are ruining the world it means that this is exactly what happens when people believe in religion...

&quot;To expect that rational and reasoned people would mock the beliefs of others is primitive and a very ugly stereotype.&quot;

You obviously &quot;expected&quot; something else from Dawkins and his supporters. Don&#039;t take the word &quot;shocked&quot; so literally.

Ahhhhh...clever girl. Look what you did there.  You through the word &quot;doing evil.&quot; I never said Dawkins is doing evil.

If your only guiding light into values is science than by definition religion is the antithesis to that and must be swept out.

		<description><![CDATA[Call it what you want, the question is, whether it&#039;s true or not. Mind you, I have nothing against atheists. One of my closest friends is an agnostic. I am referring to atheists like HIM and  his supporters. It doesn&#039;t matter what you believe in. In the end, a human is a human. I believe in God, he believes in science. We each develop our own values from that. To him, my values are evil and destroying the world. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is anyone really shocked? This is obviously their next logical step. For them, ridding the world of religion is their version of tikkun loam. Our beliefs are vile, irrational and causes great harm to this world. So why wouldn&#039;t you want to be as upfront as possible to get rid of it? He is being TOTALLY reasonable. 

This is what happens when your very existence is dedicated to science only. And that science is the be all and answer to all of life&#039;s existence. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you that people shouldn&#039;t mock other who hold religious beliefs, even if those beliefs are nonsense.

What needs to be eliminated is not necessarily religion, but (some?  most?) religious communities and  (all?) religious institutions.  The communities and institutions are where the bigotry, arrogance, and immorality is found.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can it not be said that having &quot;beliefs&quot; (not necessarily &quot;religious&quot; ones) also expresses itself in the same way. I&#039;m thinking for example of Hitler whose terrible actions (bigotry, and worse, violence) were philosophically underpinned by is beliefs in the primacy of concepts such as survival of the fittest. But we cannot do away with beliefs. People and griups of people have them and they are an important part of what makes us human. In fact I see it as likely that the &quot;ridicule and verbal attacks&quot; by atheists will in some quarters devolve into bigotry, violence and worse, against religious people.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Its too late for that. Its easier to convince someone that God dosesnt extist* than to undo millenia of ideas and beliefs that have become accepted as tradition. Often the bigotry is not just a product of the belief but an actual law and element of the religion.
