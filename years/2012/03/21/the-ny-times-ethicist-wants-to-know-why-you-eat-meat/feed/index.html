		<description><![CDATA[What right have I to kill another living animal? I have the same right as any other living creature to eat meat. Each animal on earth eats what is suited to them. Being an omnivore, as demonstrated my my sharp eye teeth and flat molars, I find I feel healthiest with a diet of meat and vegetables or fruit. I share this trait with other fine specimens of the animal kingdom including bears. My species has just grown irresponsible about how they &quot;hunt&quot; their meat.

 I have organic, locally raised beef in my freezer. I&#039;ve worked for a bio-dynamic farm here in Oregon that uses their organically raised cattle for manure for their vegetables and then sell the beef in the fall. Their farm produces so much more than they can sell that they donate huge amounts of produce to the local food bank. I have a coworker who lovingly raises chickens for their eggs and then eats the ones who don&#039;t produce. Those chickens eat the harmful insects in her garden and she fertilizes her yard and garden with the manure they leave behind. Nothing is wasted.  Nothing in that process seems a bit unethical to me. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ I think the argument is valid. If we&#039;re just smarter animals, then whatever is moral/ethical for animals is moral/ethical for us. The fact that a cow doesn&#039;t want to eat meat is totally irrelevant. Any wild animal that wants to eat meat and can do so (without getting killed, for instance), will do so. But we don&#039;t attribute morality to animals. Maybe that&#039;s the point atheist vegetarians should be addressing. If you equate animals with people and acknowledge that it&#039;s all right for many animals to eat meat, then you have to say it&#039;s all right for people to eat meat. Or perhaps they think animals shouldn&#039;t either (but just try to convince the hungry lion to have some grass instead). ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the appropriate starting point for any action is &quot;is this action moral?&quot;. So yes, the starting point must be, &quot;if I cannot justify this behavior, it must be wrong.&quot;

Maybe human beings should be herbivores? You can&#039;t just dismiss that as an option - it exists in nature!

You make a decent argument. But it is not a winner IMO.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great response Noam . . .As an atheist who loves meat, I have struggled with this question, and have come to similar conclusions. Rabbi Fink, we must both be on the same carnivorous wavelegth - I also posted on food/morality/meat  today (more food, less morality though).

		<description><![CDATA[I think part of it is how you frame the question, right? It seems as though you are starting from the assumption that it&#039;s morally wrong to kill and eat an animal, but I think that assumption is incorrect, in and of itself.  Here&#039;s why:

Killing for food is a biological imperative, built into nature and the food chain.  The fact is that animals from every size and shape eat other animals beneath them on the food chain (OK, not herbivores, but whatever).  It&#039;s in every animals nature to either hunt and eat, or hide/defend and avoid being eaten.  It&#039;s got nothing to do with be allowed to, it&#039;s hardwired into nature.  

So if you start with the assumption that eating other animals is part of nature, you need a good reason to say it&#039;s NOT allowed.  I don&#039;t think you have that.  Sure, there are arguments you can make (humans have evolved into &quot;higher&quot; beings above animal instincts, for example) that are nice, but don&#039;t rise to the level of ethically wrong. If you want to be an enlightened higher being, good for you. Reject your animal instincts and try to overcome them. But don&#039;t say it&#039;s immoral to live within them either.  Would you even ASK if it&#039;s immoral to procreate? Of course not! It&#039;s a biological imperative!

Is it wrong that humans have evolved to the top of the food chain? Does it change the morality that we&#039;ve gotten very good at being on top of the food chain (farms, slaughterhouses, etc.) or does it change the morality that we&#039;ve also gotten better at alternatives (farming, alternative protein sources, etc)? I say no. Morality/ethics are absolutes. If something is moral by nature, it&#039;s moral now. It may make vegans uncomfortable, but it&#039;s not unethical.

And that&#039;s not even starting with the slightly off-balance question of whether you can even owe an ethical duty to an animal that doesn&#039;t understand, doesn&#039;t acknowledge and can&#039;t reciprocate the same duty.

Here&#039;s my last point on this: next time you encounter a hungry grizzly bear, please, by all means, talk to him about the ethics of killing/eating another animal. Hopefully, you&#039;ll distract him long enough that I can run FAR away.]]></description>
