I think it&#039;s great that you enjoy attending synagogue and feel it&#039;s an appropriate place to grow spiritually, learn and appreciate Judaism.  So do I. 

My response was an answer to R. Fink&#039;s request for suggestions about where someone who wants Jewish experiences OUTSIDE the synagogue and outside what is referred to &quot;institutionalized Judaism&quot;.  I&#039;m not sure what that means, but I chose to understand it as a form of &quot;organized religion&quot; where you have a rabbi, services at a set time, and are encouraged and expected to say certain prayers and certain times together with others who has affiliated likewise.  

The Jewish Community Center for many people (not you or I, but others) is the answer.   They can participate in any of a multitude of events with a Jewish theme or just hang out with other Jews, and that gives them &quot;a Jewish home for those who do not seek a congregational affiliation” as Medalon Braun of the Workmen’s Circle was looking for in the article.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[response to ahg .
What you described is the place for fitness and fun. I am born from a Jewish mother, who never attended the temple. For two reasons: her mother died in 1914 from pogrom, when she was only 5 years old, and she grew up as an orphan, fearful and quiet until she died in 1985 from the heart attack, - the day she was refused the visa by soviets. She wanted to join me and my two boys in the USA.  I came here in 1979 at the age of 40 with no English in my head. Time has past, and I&#039;have met many Jews here - mostly immigrants from the Soviet Union. None of them attended a synagogue.
 But since I walked into my Shul I have found my real identity, and my life had obtained a special sense. All I want now only that my mother would get some magic signal that her tortured being should come to the end - thank to her son&#039;s merging with his people by having a special place - the Temple - where his mind and soul obtained the proud belief.
Not always well and living 85 miles away from my Shul - if I don&#039;t attend it - I nevertheless study Torah through the internet classes delivered by my Rabbi. 
So, I disagree with your choice - as you say &quot;without the &quot;burden&quot; or prayer or a sermon&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The solution already exists.  It&#039;s called the Jewish Community Center (JCC).
I live in town of approximately 50,000 Jews.  A few hundred families affiliate Orthodox, a whole lot affiliate Conservative or Reform, but the majority of them are secular, and if asked about their affiliation it&#039;s not uncommon to hear &quot;I don&#039;t belong to a Temple but I&#039;m a member of the JCC&quot;.  

The JCC in my area is a huge sprawling complex with a fitness center that rivals or exceeds your large fitness centers.  It has two olympic size pools as well as outdoor ones.  It has an indoor play center for kids that&#039;s to die for, as well as a large outdoor playground.   It runs programs for every age group all year round, features a dairy, kosher-certified, cafe, a small gift shop, and holocaust memorial hall, an auditorium, and so much more.   The facility is also host to the Federation offices, Jewish Family and Children&#039;s Services and few other Jewish organizations, but have no fear, there&#039;s no synagogue on site.   They run a pre-school, and a day camp at a nearby more rural location.  Membership entitles you to use the day camp on weekends during the summer for swimming in the pool or the lake and use of the boating facility.  

The cost of family membership is comparable or less than two adult memberships to one of those mega-fitness center facilities and less than most area Synagogues/Temples.   

What&#039;s not to like?   It&#039;s open to Jews and non-Jews alike but they&#039;ll tell you that a very strong majority are Jewish (or at least self-identify as Jewish).  The nursery is also open to everyone, but the programming is Jewish oriented.  The kids learn about Shabbat, the Jewish Holidays in their season, etc.   The classes, speakers, and other programs are almost always of a  Jewish nature.  

If you want a place to feel Jewish, without the &quot;burden&quot; or prayer or a sermon - this is your &quot;Gan Eden&quot;.]]></description>
