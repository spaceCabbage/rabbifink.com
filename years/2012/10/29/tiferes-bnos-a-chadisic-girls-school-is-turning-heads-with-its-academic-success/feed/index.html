		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;There is some skepticism over these scores. As a skeptical person, I am very curious how these tests are administered in this school. I am not accusing them of cheating or fixing the scores. But I would be much more confident if the scores could be independently verified. If only just to ease my conscience.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;


Would you have that same reaction of the school in question was RAMAZ? Or do you apply such feelings exclusively to certain classes of Jews that are out of your favor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Presumably, they aren&#039;t doing much with it at all. 

Aren&#039;t schools legally required to provide a certain level of education in New York? If so, I don&#039;t see why they wouldn&#039;t try to do it well (provided they aren&#039;t afraid that it will cause students to go off the derekh to Stern College). 

In fact, as I understand it, it&#039;s pretty common for Hareidi girls schools to have strong secular studies curricula. It&#039;s not &quot;Bittul Toyrah&quot; in the same way it would be for men.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reminds me of this:

http://oldfraser.lexi.net/publications/studies/education/report_card/2001/ont/section_06.html

(Look towards the bottom of the schools tied for #1 in Ontario.)

Now, this wasn&#039;t a particularly in depth ranking system (though it did get better and I think we held our spot for a few years) and it&#039;s not the same situation, but it reminds me how sometimes small schools can do well simply based on the group of students they happen to have at the time. (Fact is, we had spectacular average SAT scores, if only because the few students to take the SAT happened to be really bright and pretty dedicated.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; I assume they have a dual curriculum. The English / Math teachers are different than the Judaic Studies. So they probably teach half days. Also, it is unlikely they would publicize breaking the law...


&#062; Recreation is eschewed in general.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; The teachers make $6000 a year

If each teacher works half a day, that’s a little over $9/hour, which is lousy – teaching is hard work, even if they “have no formal educational training.” If they’re working the full day, it’s about $4.5/hour, which is well below minimum wage.

&#062; I am not convinced that taking away all distractions is good for children in the long run.

It’s not like chassidishe kids don’t have toys or play games. They just don’t have TVs.

&#062; As a skeptical person, I am very curious how these tests are administered in this school.

I was wondering that too. If the scores are legitimate, then this is an amazing school. But there have been many cases of teachers and administrators providing students with test answers when there was motivation for them to do so.]]></description>
