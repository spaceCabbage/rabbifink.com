		<description><![CDATA[This is always the question: how can we get by as moral people without the Torah?

The answer is that modern values are the key to the survival of Yiddishkeit.

The obvious stuff is things like mesirah – where a Roman Catholic layperson, Joe Hynes the Brooklyn DA – had to put his foot down to save Jewish children from child predators over the objections of the Haredi rabbis.  It might even cost him his job in the next election.

Maybe less obvious is the health authorities in NYC trying to find a delicate way to put a stop to metzitzah bal peh in order to protect an infant from orally transmitted herpes (which for an infant is a serious thing.)

They sort of lost that one.  The infants will remain at risk.  The consent form from parents (hardly protective of the infant) is going to be largely ignored and is only a half measure anyway.

Then there are the small things transmitted from pop psychology, self help literature, and the enlightenment back to Judaism – the mussar movement itself was an attempt to feed Jews things that they were starting to find in the secular world.

Jewish values hardly exist – outside of some of the very significant contributions they made to Western culture – like equality before G-d (and the law), the idea of a better tomorrow, and some others.

The West has accepted these gifts – and rejected the ones that are not any good for the world. Probably this is the reason that Jews now marry out without a thought – the differences are now largely aesthetic, cultural, and not really about values.
