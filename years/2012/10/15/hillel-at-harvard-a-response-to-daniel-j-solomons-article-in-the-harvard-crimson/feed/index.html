		<description><![CDATA[Thank You! 

I guess as someone from lakewood I think it is more common then people realize. Anyways i was not talking about myself when it comes to &quot;lakewood-type&quot; because i definitely am not, i just meanT that it is possible, and i guess that NO ONE is forced to live a certain way. Either way i read a lot of your articles and often find them very enjoyable, so keep posting!

Happy Thanksgiving :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course you CAN, it&#039;s just rare and there is a reason that people are surprised when there are exceptions. More importantly, the kind of ultra-orthodox Jew at Harvard is certainly going to be more out of the box than the guy sitting in BMG. So the point I was making still holds. I am happy to hear you are in Stern. Hatzlacha raba!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i guess i just think their are alot of exceptions..to the point where they should no longer be called exceptions because calling them that would be seriously stereotyping ..  i myself am from lkwd and am in Stern college for women (not that that is near an iv league....but i am on a full scholarship) I came straight from a lakewood HS.. again i would agree it is not typical.. but i guess i am kind of sick of the rhetoric that people in lakewood do not have choices or do not have opportunity... as much as i have been loving stern the reactions i get when people find out i live in lakewood... are usually like &quot;lucky you for escaping&quot; or just automatically assuming that i hate lakewood etc... it is a form of bigotry that is truly disturbing... let alone the fact that i think lakewood is a great place, although, yes i did CHOSE, to leave..my best friends are all from lakewood.... Wow! I am rambling but i guess my point is, is that the quote suggests that you can not be &quot;lakewood-type&quot; and still do things like go to college and that is just not true....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this is kind of funny because i actually know the guy. He is ultra-orthodox by all definitions of the word. He married a &quot;lakewood&quot; girl, and learned in BMG fro like 8 years, recieved his BTL, was not sure if he wanted to go to law school, took his LSAT without studying at all to see if he would do well, scored perfectly, and was accepted to harvard...

Its funny how you would just decide they are not ultraorthodox when they are...just because you obviously do not like the idea of a ultraorthodox person making their own choices... and being successful in the secular world..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@cipher:disqus you cant possibly know what I regard as a positive thing since you dont know me. My interest in Isadore Twersky has nothing to do with his religious affiliation but rather his familial relation. 



I know very well the history of their Corey Road shul in Brighton, I&#039;ve been there a few times, and why it was closed. 


Mayer Twersky and his brother Moshe are far from Hasidic, they are Haredi, but of the Yeshivish style not the Hasidic one. I believe his interest in having the shul altogether is more about continuing a line that has existed for 150 years and not about wanting to be a rebbe. Mayer is more Brisk than Tolna. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, his son, Rabbi Mayer Twersky, who is now the Talner Rebbe, behaves more like a Haredi than his father did. He used to show up at the Talner shul several times a year and sort of take over. He became increasingly imperious and people balked (some left), so he closed up shop (his mother, who is Rav Soloveitchik&#039;s daughter and who kept the shul going for a decade and a half after the old Rebbe&#039;s death, didn&#039;t oppose him) and reopened it in Riverdale.

Ironically, he&#039;s also a Rosh Yeshiva at YU. He&#039;s an example of the Haredization of Modern Orthodoxy. I&#039;m sure you see it as a positive thing; I regard it as a tragedy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shulem, my understanding is that he was ambivalent about calling himself
 &quot;rebbe&quot;. I was told by someone close to him (I live in Boston) that he 
didn&#039;t begin using the title until about a year after his father&#039;s 
death, and that was at his brothers&#039; insistence (he wasn&#039;t the eldest 
son, but apparently was the most charismatic and they ceded the title to
 him). Even then, he seemed to have mixed feelings. He&#039;s been quoted as 
saying, &quot;If people regard me as a rebbe and consult me as one, then I&#039;m a rebbe.&quot;

There is a sizable contingent of Modern Orthodox at Harvard. There are no Haredim of whom I&#039;m aware.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also had my own misgivings when I was 18 years old and a freshman at Brooklyn College 11-12 years ago. I was in for a nice culture shock when the Hillel there promoted things like &quot;Trembling Before G-d&quot; and Yitzchak Rabin&#039;s granddaughter leading Kaddish services, all in the name of pluralism. I even wrote an article on their pluralism but never had it published as I considered the consequences of such an article. I&#039;m glad my article stayed unpublished as my personal points of view today are much more mature, if not changed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Mr. Solomon, there are no Ultra-Orthodox Jews at Harvard. Going to Harvard disqualifies one consideration as an Ultra-Orthodox Jew.&quot;  


This is one of stupidest comments I&#039;ve read.  Would you also say &quot;There are no Ultra-Orthodox Jews that beat their wives or molest kids, b/c those disqualify...&quot;, or there are no Ultra-Orthodox Jews that evade taxes, that gossip, that have gambling problems...  or anything else that you don&#039;t think are part of being UO?  In some ways that&#039;d be wonderful because we could then prove to the world that we don&#039;t have serious problems in our community.  But playing games with definitions is really just that, playing games with definitions.


Of course there are Jews in Harvard that on any other day of the week you would call Ultra Orthodox.  This is a stupid game to play.

		<description><![CDATA[I see from your facebook posts that you don&#039;t consider moderate yeshivish types to be UOJ.  I guess many of us don&#039;t agree with that definition, and I think those black-hatted yeshivish guys doing night school at Brooklyn College would also consider themselves to be UOJ.  


What do you think of this discussion over at the YWN Coffee about where to go to college?  http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/yeshivish-good-learners-who-want-to-go-to-college]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@d3b619ce0aff9482fdfe2e75ad3bbab6:disqus you are arguing the no true Scotsman fallacy it would seem. 


Yes, he wasnt a fanatical pseudo Hungarian wannabe dictator like Joel Titlebaum and his great-nephews. He was a moderate Russian style Rebbe. It was his Russian background that allowed his father to want him to get a better education. 


I once asked Marc B. Shapiro if he ever intends to write a bio of Isadore Twersky, to which he replied that he became more devoted to Hasadism in his later years so his family wouldnt cooperate with a book focusing on his academics.  and of course his grave on Mt Olives just has the regular rabbinic text of Admur M&#039;Tolna et al. 



Malkiel Kotler is a Rosh Yeshiva and so is Dov Linzer of Chovevei Torah. Would you say Linzer isnt? Your argument would indicate that he isnt. 


numner of followers also doesnt disqualify someone from being a &quot;rebbe&quot; or half of boro park would be out if business. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow. Thank you Rabbi Fink for bringing this article to light. Hillel was so pivotal to me back when I was an undergraduate at a university with a miniscule Jewish population (West Virginia University). While I was Reform back in those days, it was via Hillel that I really got serious about Judaism. Previously, I had just attended services and was really a spectator to it all. At Hillel, we did &quot;Jewish things&quot;...as students we were responsible for organizing Shabbat dinners and leading services. We went camping on Sukkot and did on-campus programming for Yom Ha&#039;Shoah. So it was via Hillel that I was able to take ownership of my faith. While none of the students were Orthodox, there were some Conservative students and I remember being awed that they could read Hebrew fluently. It was through them that I learned many Jewish customs and prayers that the Reform liturgy didn&#039;t utilize anymore.

To me, Mr. Solomon&#039;s sentiments make no sense. He can&#039;t stand that Orthodox Jews are not just like him? Doesn&#039;t that work completely against the arguments that higher education in America is greatly enhanced by diversity in a learning &amp; living community? Because this is a Jew talking badly about other Jews, I guess this is ok. But if he were talking in the same tone about Muslims or Asians; it would almost most definitely not be ok! As Jews we need to stop with the baseless hatred among each other. It is fine to not agree...but to despise? Not so fine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, but no. He might&#039;ve been a scion of Chasidic dynasties and for all I know a great man himself. But there is not a single objective measure by which he could be considered ultra-Orthodox or Chasidic. Unless you expand those terms to be so broad that they become completely meaningless.

		<description><![CDATA[The Crimson article is pure Orthodox bashing, and should make us all upset, whether he is lashing out at ultra- or modern-Orthodox.  In fact it should offend anyone with any sense of Jewish identity.
&quot;Our faith is about the only thing Reform and Conservative Jews share with the Orthodox, and what the Orthodox stand for is anathema to us&quot;
 &quot;junked practices like keeping kosher and observing the Sabbath&quot;


These are just a few of his more offensive comments.  


My only hope that with more maturity and more time at a top ivy-league institution, Mr. Solomon attains more wisdom...and more tolerance for his fellow Jew.

		<description><![CDATA[They are indeed busy with mesira. In fact its a motivating factor in much of their dealings and attitudes towards outsiders. 

Also , i dont agree with your point that ultra orthodox jews dont go to harvard. While there are certaibly more of other types i know personally of two ppl in recent years.  

And lets not forget that a Chasidish Rebbe was once the head of the judaic studies department. ]]></description>
