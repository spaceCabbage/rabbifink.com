		<description><![CDATA[Silly story for these issues to arise from, but the issues are significant.

Re: your first latent issue - I&#039;m not sure why that&#039;s even in this piece, but yes, there are words used by fans and the media to describe players that vary depending on the player’s ethnicity. And yes, black players are called athletic. And white players are called smart. But while you say &quot;This is not meant to be insulting or racial. It just happens.&quot; I say &quot;Why should it happen?&quot; It is certainly implicitly racist, and at this point (since it&#039;s been called out in recent years) it borders on explicitly racist. Why is a smaller white athlete praised for &quot;hustle&quot; and a smaller black athlete praised for &quot;athleticism?&quot; By the way, this also swings both ways. As Jason Whitlock wrote last week, the media is often hesitant to criticize black quarterbacks the way they do white quarterbacks, for fear of coming off racist. But that&#039;s also racism.

As for the second issue, &quot;Is playing probabilities and making snap judgments based on well established norms, racism?&quot; You say it&#039;s not, and that may or may not be the case. Here&#039;s my question: Say someone is walking down a dark street and decides to go to the other side when he sees someone approaching. And say he only makes that decision if the person approaching is of a certain race. Can he use the excuse of &quot;playing probabilities,&quot; or can we call that decision racist?]]></description>
