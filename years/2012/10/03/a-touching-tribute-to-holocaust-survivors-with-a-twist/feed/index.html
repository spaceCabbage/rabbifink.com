		<description><![CDATA[Tattoos are NOT forbidden by Jewish Law. You will get different answers from different Rabbis, but the majority agree no laws are broken by getting inked. The Torah says nothing about tats specifically and the whole &quot;you cannot be buired in a Jewish cemetary if you have a tattoo&quot; is BS. Its an old wives tale.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I very much enjoyed your thoughts on this Rabbi Fink. I myself have written one for TCJewfolk.  I was wondering if I might have permission to use your photo?  Apologies for writing this on your comment section but I couldn&#039;t find an email.  Either way, thank you. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder what your thoughts would be on non-Jews wearing the tattoo of a survivor they knew.  On the one hand, this would not violate a Torah prohibition, and on the other hand would serve to remind those outside of the Jewish community of the holocaust and the complicity of silence on the part of many non-Jews.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Nazis used these tattoos to dehumanize Jews—we were not people with names, families, or personal identities, but chattel to be catalogued, shipped off to camps, and in millions of cases exterminated. Although the grandchildren in the NYT article clearly wish to honor their grandparents suffering, it is difficult for me to see how a symbol of such brutality could ever be re-appropriated. 


A similar attempt at coöptation in the US provides a somewhat cautionary analogy. In recent decades, some African-Americans have chosen to refer to one another by the N-word in the belief that this will simultaneously evoke the memory of racism and emasculate it.  Yet, the majority of Americans (black, white and otherwise) still find the term extremely offensive. As the discipline of semiotics has taught us, the meanings of language, signs and symbols are not so easily malleable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that this specific use of tattoos WOULD indeed seem to be very close to the (plain reading of the) Torah prohibition!

BTW, here are a couple of the relevant posts on kashrut.org:

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;But voluntary tattoos are prohibited by the Torah.&quot; Rabbi Abadi insists that the issur is when a tattoo is done out of grief for a meis, and not when done for cosmetic or beautification reasons. Not a popular viewpoint, to be sure, but it does seen to be supported by a plain reading of Leviticus 19:28. Rambam doesn&#039;t qualify the issur, but his take on it is that it was done for idolatrous purposes. ]]></description>
