		<description><![CDATA[I think it also has to do with your planning.  You kept it casual, kept the kids entertained, and fed them something they would like to eat.

Keeping the limitations of thirteen-year-olds in mind is crucial.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Timely, since this past Shabbos Kodesh was our son&#039;s bar mitzvah and we had a casual melave malka for our out of town guess and a three families we are close with (a total of 20 adults) and my son&#039;s classmates (total of 39 boys).
 
While our school prides themselves on being a place where &quot;Middos and Torah learning are linked together&quot;, I think that it&#039;s really the parents responsibility to teach their kids how to behave.  School can run &quot;middos of the month&quot; programs and have contests and awareness campaigns, but if middos are not generated in the home, then we have lost the battle.
 
Our son&#039;s event was pretty low-key.  We brought in two guys from an improv comedy company and they put on an interactive show and played a few improv games with the boys.  We served pizza and soda, too.  Aside from a few kids that always seem to be more active than others (especially when certain time released medications have run their course by the evening), there were no problems.  This is mostly due to the parents of our son&#039;s classmates and the expectation from the day school that middos are something of value.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You absolutely can teach character and moral and ethical behavior.  Many organizations pride themselves on it and parents seek them out for their children for this very reason.  Consider the Boy Scouts.  It&#039;s a shame that yeshivas make very little if any effort to impart character or teach proper behavior.  If anything, they often undermine it by instead teaching Jews are better than non-Jews or white-washing unethical behavior we see from &quot;frum&quot; Jews in the media or even from personalities in the bible (for example, King David and Batsheva).  The last point also relates to the incredibly over-emphasis on Gemara instead of teaching character/behavior.  Talmudic reasoning is brought to bear on ethical situations and the moral is ultimately lost; instead of &quot;don&#039;t steal&quot; the lesson becomes &quot;in certain scenarios taking someone else&#039;s property isn&#039;t considered stealing.&quot;


It&#039;s a real failure of our communities when kids run around like vilda chayas and engage in wanton property destruction and no one blinks an eye or says &quot;oh well, kids will be kids.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Who is responsible?


Well, first and foremost the child. Not so much at the beginning, but more and more as they grow up. Second, the parents, they are there to guide the children and to teach them right from wrong, and proper behavior. Third, their teachers, there are certain lessons that a teacher can impart better, or differently, than a parent, and it adds another perspective to the growing child. Fourth, their friends, nobody&#039;s parents are perfect and they can always fill some gaps from friends. Later on, their classmates, colleagues, managers, etc.


And you don&#039;t suddenly stop learning how to behave when you become an adult at about age 18, most of us continue learning as we grow older. For example, at some point, we learn how to behave at an event such as a fundraising dinner or at an auction, or at any new kind of event that we&#039;ve never participated in before. I&#039;ve seen people only learn how to behave properly as a spectator on a golf course at a relatively advanced age.


And there are some that never learn proper behavior.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Who is responsible to make sure kids behave and learn good manners?


Well, I think those are extensions of character development which is very much part of Judaism (i.e. pirkei avot). Now, granted, I don&#039;t think they are going to care, by just belching out pirkei avot, but if the same kind of attention and time was put into moral/character development as they do with a page of Talmud, it may just be a good thing. ]]></description>
