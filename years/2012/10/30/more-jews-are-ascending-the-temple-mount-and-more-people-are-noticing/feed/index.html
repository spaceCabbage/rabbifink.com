		<description><![CDATA[Of course more Jews going up to and on the Har HaBayis is provocative.  First, it is a change from the norm.  Second, millions of demographically powerful Muslims will not like it and thus set off all sorts of reactions by interested groups (religious organizations, nations, governments, private business with an interest in using the governments that they decry to do their &quot;private&quot; business &quot;competition&quot; for them, etc).  Third, Jewish interests in perpetuating the &quot;don&#039;t go up there&quot; &quot;halacha&quot; have a problem with it.  And, on and on.  People just need to acknowledge that these kinds of things go on in the world and then decide what they want to do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The current situation on Har haBayis is one of historical revisionism.  Jews always ascended to the Temple Mount to pray.  In the early days of Islamic control of Israel there was even a shul up there because the Muslim leadership of the time recognized Jewish claims to the area and the myth of Muhammed making it an exclusive mosque hadn&#039;t yet become commonplace.
But one cannot blame the Israeli police for their actions in preventing prayer on the Mount.  It&#039;s simple logic: who would you rather have to deal with?  One lonely guy with a siddur or thousands of screaming savages?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your discussing this.
The difficulty is first and foremost with us. 

There is an unholy alliance between Israel&#039;s secular left wing and the Orthodox right wing. Each of them wants to keep Jews away from Har Habayit. 

 As you say almost all Orthodox Jews grew up thinking that setting foot anywhere in the area is a &quot;chiuv kares&quot;. It will take time to convince the Orthodox world that this is not true, and as Orthodoxy is so resistant to change this may be decades of time.

BTW - besides for Rabbi Tendler many Israeli Rabbis &#038; Roshei Yeshiva from the Religious Zionist world have gone and continue to urge their students and followers to go as they consider it a mitzvah.

To stand any chance, we need to start focusing on Har Habayit. We need to put Har Habayit in the foreground and the Kotel in the background. At this point in history we do the opposite.

I myself have ascended Har Habayit al pi dat v&#039;din (after tevilah etc.)
But even if you are in the halachik camp that does not go up to har habayit you can do things to keep har habayit in the proper perspective:

-when in israel, before going to the kotel, walk up to the ramp to the gate of har habayit and daven there.
- if you decorate your home with pictures of the kotel, then make sure to  have pictures of har habayit.
-study it - there are some excellent new books about har habayit, including one in English by shaar press in conjunction w/the Western Wall Heritage foundation.
- visit the machon hamikdash in Jerusalem and explore the resources on their website (www.templeinstitute.org)

- if you hear ppl or read news stories that say &quot;the western wall judaism holiest site&quot; - correct them. Judaism&#039;s holiest site (and only inherently holy site) is the Temple Mount.


the more we do to educate ourselves and to internalize the message that our real passion is for Har Habayit more so than the Kotel - the better chance we have of making headway, so that Har Habayit will not be the only place in the world that a Jew cannot pray.]]></description>

Of course, Jews aren&#039;t permitted to &quot;pray&quot; up there. If they are caught, they are immediately escorted off the premises. People have all sorts of tricks to pray without being caught, like holding a cellphone up to ones ear while praying, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It has been a collective dream of ours to pray on the Temple Mount for two thousand years.&quot;

It is worth mentioning that praying on the Temple Mount is a right currently being denied to Jews. There are few places left in the world where a Jew cannot pray and that our holiest site should be one of them is an ongoing tragedy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It would be a dream for Jews to have equal access to the Temple Mount. Would the world think it provocation worthy of retaliation if Roman Catholics wanted to visit Bethelem? Why won&#039;t people think these things through to their logical conclusions?! (Why do I keep asking questions like that one?) Thank you for posting this!
P.S. I just had dinner with Dr. Mark and Mrs. Randye Danzinger : ) They send their regards!]]></description>
