		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, It&#039;s a pleasure following your thinking/filling.  Your   &quot;how does mercy reconcile with judgment if judgment means that every action has an immediate physical and spiritual reaction?&quot; makes you suddenly fill that nobody has an answer to that. If you had stopped there it would feel being abandoned. I saw more lines and I felt that you show me an escape path from this maze And you did.  This is a very efficient way to have your followers to react naturally, without defensive intention to argue first and capitulate with an incomplete agreement soon after... You are a very gifted also in structuring the dramatic flow of thoughts and deeds. It&#039;s provocative to me to that: 
Actor—-&#062;Desire—-&#062;Action—-&#062;Result. Particularly engaging this - &quot;Teshuva is the process of “undoing” the desire for the action and its result. True repentance occurs when the actor wishes with all their heart that they had never acted the way they did. When the person truly regrets their choice the desire part of the action can be unhooked from the actor! If there is no hook connecting the action to the actor (the desire) then the actor and the action are no longer associated with one another. That is teshuva.&quot; I would love to talk to you sometime about the connection between an ACTOR and Desire  with a special guest MOTIVATION, who I would love to introduce to you.
Happy Rosh Hashanah
