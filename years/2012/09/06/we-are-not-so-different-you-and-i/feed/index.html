		<description><![CDATA[I thought the post was well-written and poignant. HOWEVER, I have been in the situation described by the author in a grad-school setting, where my closest friends in the class were Muslims. We had our &quot;chumros&quot; and family lifestyles in common and we were able to easily relate to one another. They even ate in kosher Israeli establishments because they were considered &quot;Halal&quot;. BUT we seldom discussed politics, of Israel or anything beyond cursory mentions of our cultural claims. It got tense and we broke off the topic. I think the author is perhaps a bit jaded in this respect. My suspicion is that, had she invited her neighbors to Mincha, they would have been offended and scornful. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;A blessing for a friend is a blessing for oneself,&quot; or something similar.  I think that I heard that from a Muslim co-worker or maybe a Baptist co-worker.  So many people live a pity party, play the victim if only in their own minds.  The Sages state in Peiki Avot that envy or jealousy, among a few things, take a person out of the world.  Love your neighbor as yourself.  The recipient of the actions of another person can trust/understand that G-d has agreed to the received action.  Yes, the actor is responsible for her or his action, but whatever we received is between us and G-d.]]></description>
