		<description><![CDATA[I am the guy who does an almost daily protest at the U of Chicago since June 2004.  When my father was a doctor at the U of Chicago, it was acceptable to do female circumcisions in the U.S.   U of Chicago doctors cut off clitorises in the old days.  Google
&quot;orificial surgery&quot; to read up on the U.S.  history of what we now call &quot;Female Genital Mutilation&quot;.   I am not paid for what I do.  I&#039;m out there because the U of C circumcises about 77% (national rate 55%) of the baby boys born there.  It is the highest infant circumcision rate of any hospital in Chicago.  The majority of Chicago hospitals cut less than 33%, yet the U of Chicago claims to be &quot;At the Forefront of Medicine&quot;.  Watch Eliyahu Ungar-Sargon&#039;s excellent documentary &quot;CUT: Slicing Through the Myths of Circumcision&quot; (www.cutthefilm.com) which was made in Chicago and features rabbis/mohels and physicians/faculty/staff/alum of the U of Chicago and/or Northwestern U.  It will give you a much better perspective of the issues we are dealing with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought it was obvious that the &quot;out and out ban&quot; that I referred to is for a parent having an infant circumcised. No one would suggest that it be banned outright once someone reaches the age of majority, what with all of the piercing, tattooing and other body modifications being done. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[


I am the anti-circumcision guy at Venice Beach (davebradt@aol.com).
 Being a grass roots movement we have no
true leader so we express our own views on the topic, based on how we view
life in general.   I talked to Rabbi Fink for a while.  I enjoyed it immensely.  A holly man with a sense of humor.  We need more. 
Being a gentile I would not presume to interfere with such an ancient civilized
tradition as Judaism.  When confronted by
those of the Jewish faith I say &quot;Well, God told you to, so who am I?  Now, if you were Christian...&quot;  I know, if there is a change, it will come
from within the Jewish church or not at all. 
As far as a law, government has to just get out of our lives (Tea Party,
can you tell?).  I set up across from the
&#039;Shul on the Beach&#039; because that is where the free speech activists set up [i.e.
Vegan, 911 is a conspiracy,  Atheists
United and sometimes Jews for Jesus (that&#039;s when sparks fly)].   We are
all self appointed advocates.  I have a
real job during the week but on Sunday I&#039;m...  Usually no one is at the Shul.   I just
lucked out.  We get those spots only
because we are the first ones there at 9:00 o&#039;clock.

		<description><![CDATA[Nobody wants an out-and-out ban. The most anyone wants is an age-restriction until the man on the other end is old enough to decide for himself if he wants (the best) part cut off. Germany and Tasmania seem bent on introducing a religious exemption, but it will be hard to allow any male cutting, continue to forbid any female cutting (even the token ritual nick that the AAP called &quot;much less extensive than male genital cutting&quot; when it tried to allow that in 2010), and maintain the equality of the sexes. Another problem with a religious exemption would be to define a religion. Pastafarianism (the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster)? Jedi? Scientology? Unification (&quot;Moonies&quot;)? Mormons? The guy in Vancouver who said God told him to do it, with a boxcutter?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[^^ 
who PAYS for these folks or are they just dedicated volunteers ^^

I know of only two instances of people being paid (and I would know).  I hired a guy to drive my &quot;infants&#039; rights&quot; float in this year&#039;s Chicago Pride Parade because I had to take my daughter on a campus visit out of state, and I didn&#039;t want to keep any of the actual volunteers from interacting with the crowd as they marched along.  The other time folks were hired was in the collection of signatures for last year&#039;s San Francisco ballet initiative to outlaw forced genital cutting.  Any other time you&#039;ve seen somebody protesting or educating, they got there on their own dime following their own heart.  


Your friend on the boardwalk does not represent all intactivists.  I think no law could protect all babies EXCEPT the children of Jews and Muslims, because it would be struck down as unconstitutionally failing to provide equal protection to all faiths and to people of no faith.  

I know it&#039;s none of my business how Jews and Muslims respond to a prohibition against cutting children, but my solution would be to have the father undergo a ceremonial blood letting in the place of the child, until such time as the child could make his own rational informed choice (let it be age 13, fine).  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Same deal at the U Chicago campus. There is a guy that passes out literature (who PAYS for these folks or are they just dedicated volunteers that can afford an 8-hour day doing this??)  and who disavows any desire to outlaw circumcision, only the default practice at many hospitals to perform them routinely. I think most Orthodox Jews are suspicious of this contention and view it as an attempt to take the first step towards an out and out ban. (A technique that the other side of the political spectrum is definitely using vis a vis abortion.)]]></description>
