		<description><![CDATA[&#062;It is a bit of a commute to the schools.


It&#039;s a bit of a commute for everything that one took for granted in Jewish communities such as the kosher restaurants and markets.


My question is other than Shabbat where everyone meets up at the shul, how much of close knit community is there? I remember when we lived in the Valley, one of our major complaints was that though there were many many Jews around, it was so spaced out that nobody felt the community. You couldn&#039;t simply walk to fellow classmates and play. You couldn&#039;t easily shul hop and see the different happenings. You simply didn&#039;t see a lot of Jews hanging around. So like you said, everything has its pluses and minuses. 


&#062;There is a conscious focus on health and wellbeing



And pot smoking :-)]]></description>
