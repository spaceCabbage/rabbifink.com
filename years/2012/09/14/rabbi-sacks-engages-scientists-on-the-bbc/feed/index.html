		<description><![CDATA[http://torahexplorer.com/2013/03/05/adam-and-eve-part-2/

Adam &#038; Eve (&#039;Adom&#039; ve &#039;Chava&#039;) were real people and Rabbi J. Sacks doesn&#039;t know what he is talking about.
Rabbi Sacks has confused many people and spread falsehood. He sounds like a &#039;kofer.&#039;

The Guide for the Perplexed, that such a belief is fundamental to Judaism:
It is a fundamental belief of Judaism that the world was created ex nihilo and that a 
specific human being, Adam, was initially created and that from his 
creation until the time of Moses approximately 2500 years elapsed.[1]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Rabbi Sacks is terrific. I really enjoy his Divrei Torah and philosophical books. However, I think he&#039;s a bit out of his element here. For example, in his discussion with the theoretical physicist he says that the &quot;God of the gaps&quot; idea is &quot;crazy&quot;.  Yet, when talking to the neuroscientist that&#039;s pretty much what he implies in getting her to say that science does not understand how the &quot;mind&quot; works or &quot;where&quot; it&#039;s located. 


And with Dawkins he basically side steps the main issue of &quot;why do you assume God exists&quot;.  So much of what Rabbi Sacks says is based on that axiomatic belief. What he does well, which he always is find &quot;common ground&quot;. His common ground here is basically that he and Dawkins are both nice guys and care about people. While that&#039;s really nice, it doesn&#039;t do much to advance the underlying discussion.


You can see more complete discussion between Rabbi Sacks and Richard Dawkins here:

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder what R&#039; Sacks holds regarding stories in Bereishis - if they are meant to be taken literally or not. When asked if he believes G-d actually spoke to Avraham by the Akeidah (and if the Akeidah happened as described in the Torah), R&#039; Sacks at first says quietly and quickly &quot;G-d talking to Abraham is clearly a parable.&quot; Then he says later &quot;the stories didn&#039;t happen as mere facts, they happened as morally instructive lessons.&quot; 

I haven&#039;t read enough of R&#039; Sacks&#039; works, but does he hold that much of Bereishis is not meant to be taken literally? 

R&#039; Fink - have you posted your thoughts on Bereishis and other parts of the Torah that are subject to similar interpretation?]]></description>
