		<description><![CDATA[&gt;  Fraenkel’s proposal is to teach debate and
philosophy as a way of increasing mutual tolerance between believers of
different faiths and non-believers.


 


It won’t work. Setting people
up as opponents is exactly the wrong way to go about building tolerance. Also,
debating is not the way to arrive at the truth. Debating is a sport, and the
better debater wins, not necessarily the one who’s right.


 


&gt; Further, most people are
not well versed enough in their religions to carry an honest debate.


 


In the theology and philosophy
of their religions. Most people just aren’t all that interested. Those who are tend
to become theologians or atheists. 


 


&gt; Learning philosophy and
engaging in debate in the more formative years of yeshiva learning could be
very beneficial. It was considered beneficial to the medieval Jewish
commentators. 


 


In the middle ages,
only the brightest boys went to yeshiva, and there was much less in philosophy,
including natural philosophy, that challenged traditional religious views. I
agree that learning philosophy can be very beneficial, but for the average kid
it would either bore them silly or lead them to the sorts of questions I was
told to stop asking in high school because (to quote the rosh yeshiva) “The
other boys wouldn’t think of these questions, and it’s better their not
bothered by yours.”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;
The problem that I have with this little study group is that they reinforce the stereotype that orthodox Judaism is not up to the challenge of philosophy. 


How could you write this post without at least a nodding reference to the long-ingrained antipathy toward &quot;chakirah&quot; and philosophy in Chassidic tradition(s)? And not only Chassidim. &quot;Chovos Halvovos is great, but you aren&#039;t &quot;supposed&quot; to learn Shaar Hayichud goes back hundreds of years in Askenazic tradition.]]></description>
