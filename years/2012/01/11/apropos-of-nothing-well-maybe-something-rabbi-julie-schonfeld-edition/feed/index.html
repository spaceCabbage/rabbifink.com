		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry, but I don&#039;t think you&#039;re correct. You write &quot;if a woman is willing to say she’asani isha v’lo ish she must not feel that it is a degrading blessing,&quot; and cite civil rights as a support. In fact, many African Americans DID feel that the way to respond to discrimination was by turning it on its head (i.e. the Black Power movement).

While I think I agree that it might not be an &quot;open-minded&quot; approach to resolving issues of discrimination, it is one that has been utilized. So, I don&#039;t understand your proof that it is not degrading.

(By the way, I&#039;m responding to your attempted proof that the bracha is not degrading [in the name of intellectual honesty]. I am NOT trying to say that I think it&#039;s degrading.)

(By the way, I&#039;ve never commented before, but I&#039;ve read many of your posts. Nice job, here.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@c057154fd302f905d4249b838f2495f5:disqus  Good point. But I have no idea how widely known it was at the time, probably not too widely known as it appears to have been a personally prepared siddur, but also not necessarily hidden from the public in any way. And it (the siddur in question) did somehow remain to this day, so it is possible, even probable, that many have seen it throughout history. And as far as we know, nobody has yet claimed anything against R&#039; Farrisol over all that time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That would be significant provided that this siddur was widely known at the time. But if it was just one woman&#039;s siddur, how would the prospective shunners know about it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the fact that R&#039; Farrisol wasn&#039;t excommunicated, or even attempted to be shunned says far more about this issue (in comparison with today) than anything else. In fact, as far as I am aware there is no contemporary criticism of R&#039; Farrisol in this regard.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see how it proves that the blessing is not degrading any more than it proves that medieval Jews didn&#039;t have denigrating attitudes toward women. It may indicate that one particular woman didn&#039;t see &quot;shelo asani isha&quot; as degrading. But neither the scribe nor the person who commissioned this siddur was the author of a blessing first said well over a thousand years before, so their take on the blessing may be irrelevant to what it really means. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would agree with you 100% about she&#039;lo asani isha..if the blessing for women (other thin in this siddur) were she lo asani ish. But it&#039;s not. Or if the blessings preceding it were not she lo asani goy and she lo asani eved. But they are. It seems like the women who had this siddur made for her was being davka. But more importantly, are you saying that women should say she lo asani ish? Or that men should say she asani ish, and women should say she asani isha?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While this of course isn&#039;t proof of any particular view held by Middle-Ages Jews, it may show the plurality of opinions and views Jews used to have as opposed to the monolithic views that Judaism enjoys in modern times. 
 
(This makes me think of this story with R&#039; Yosef Dov Solovetchik and R&#039; Shaul Lieberman: RSL mentioned to RYDS that a manuscript was found that indicated that a sheretz is not metamei a Kohen, which is contrary to the long accepted opinion. To this the Rav responded (not verbatim), &quot;you think ignoramuses didn&#039;t have access to parchment back then?&quot;)]]></description>
