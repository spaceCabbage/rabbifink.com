		<description><![CDATA[Wow you make it sound so evil. I mean it&#039;s just horrible to have compassion and reconcile differences. It&#039;s so much more productive to hate and kill. 
WHAT?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No. After the war, the prisoners who were not a threat were sent home. That&#039;s how it works.

Maybe you&#039;ll understand why people who are on opposite sides of a war can become friends when you get a little older. At least I hope...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am confused why this person was let go... it was up to your congregant and his partner to set him free and run back to the enemy?? Also, this man&#039;s mission was to kill your congregant and his partner... no matter if his mission was governmentally sanctioned and therefor likened to that of Israel, the point is he accepted this mission to kill Jews as a soldier and I am confused why they would have exchanged information with someone who was out to kill them]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Urinating on the corpses of a fallen enemy is uncalled for and improper, but it is hardly desecration in the context of battlefield conduct. I suggest you refrain from criticizing unless you have been in a combat situation yourself.]]></description>
