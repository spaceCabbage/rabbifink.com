his objection was to giving any type of zechus to the niftar. &lt;/i&gt;

Is there a halacha anywhere that says NOT to give zechus to a Jew who was niftar?

		<description><![CDATA[Reading Rabbi 










dr. Schochat&#039;s letter taught me a few things:

R.S. does not make any personal attacks on S.B. He only says that the message is heretical. 

R.S. does not say anything about excommunication.

He doesn&#039;t even say you can&#039;t listen to what S.B. says, rather he only says not to give him a &#039;platform...to discuss this topic&#039;.

R. S. ends off with a way that S.B. can make amends if he wants (and I hope he does) by retracting the book.

I think that from R.S. clear and straightforward condemnation of the book, and at the same time not making any personal attacks on S.B.s character or say anything beyond what he feels needs to be said, we can learn that while we may disagree with people (often very strongly-as in this case), we must also be respectful to them. 

V&#039;haboteach Bashem Chesed Yisovovenu. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Boteach isn&#039;t the first one to assert this view.  There was a three hundred year gap between the life of Jesus and the first organized Christian church (being a separate entity, and not a whacky meshichist sect of Jews)

If Jesus really did tell everyone that he was Divine, what took his followers so long to say it?

The rest of his teachings wouldn&#039;t qualify as avodah zarah.  If Boteach and others are correct, Jesus was essentially the first Reform rabbi.

In the modern era, Moses Mendelssohn is widely considered to be the father of Reform Judaism.  He was a halachically observant Jew his entire life.  He wanted to change a few things here and there, but stayed within the basic context of halacha.  It was only his followers who broke away from halacha.

This is how all deviations occur.  The yetzer hara knows that it can&#039;t get a frum Jew to go all the way to severe sin in one shot.  First, it seduces the Jew to take one tiny step in that direction.  Just walk past the treif restaurant.  No harm in that.  Just stand there for a few seconds to smell the food.  Oh, that smells great.  One gets accustomed to that, let&#039;s say every day for a month.  then it&#039;s:

&quot;just walk up to the door&quot;  a month later...

&quot;just go inside and sit down&quot;  a month later...

&quot;just taste one little piece - it&#039;s less than a kezayis, it doesn&#039;t count!&quot;

Pretty soon, this Jew is happily eating treif everyday.  

I suppose we can never know the truth when in comes to Jesus, but the theory seems perfectly plausible to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds just like Professor Jastrow&#039;s &quot;A Jew&#039;s Jesus,&quot; in Herman Wouk&#039;s Winds of War and War and Remembrance. The only difference I can see is that the book there was totally fictional. But it was a best seller, and people, both Jews and Christians, seemed to like it. Personally, the subject sounds pretty interesting. With all of the biblical criticism and so forth over the past few hundred years, what could possible be left to say on this subject that would still be contraversial?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s where I think you (and SB) err. When The Chasam Sofer told his followers that it would be better not to learn on the nittel (December 25th) his objection was to giving any type of zechus to the niftar. While I personally do not hold of the nittel, I respect the Chasam Sofer&#039;s rejection of anything Jesus since so many Jews were either killed, converted or persecuted as a result of him. For a person like Shmully Boteach to even write the word kosher vis-a-vis Jesus is an attempt at his own personal career aggrandizement, viz. selling books, at the expense of kiddush Hashem.    ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t feel sorry for him at all. He courts controversy and loves it. Why do you think he named his books Kosher Sex and Kosher Jesus. Right there, controversial title, sells. A ban would pay for his sons and daughters educations. 
The annoying thing is that in his article on HuffPost he is making out this is due to the fanatical right making inroads into mainstream Judaism. Not true, Jews have distanced themselves from Jesus, the Church and The New Testament for a very long time. Not just the far right elements of Judaism but the vast majority. And those parts that do embrace Jesus are shunned.
