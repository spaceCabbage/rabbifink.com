		<description><![CDATA[Whether the rabbi&#039;s conduct was halachic or not, or appropriate in our zeitgeist or not, is a debate that must happen.

However - I object to the article&#039;s implication that anyone went &quot;off the derech&quot; because of Rav Bina&#039;s methods.

Several studies (including Margolese&#039;s book &quot;Off The Derech&quot;) have consistently shown that the cause of going OTD (if there is a cause) is physical/emotional abuse/neglect AT HOME, during childhood and early adolescence.

Granted, if an already emotionally fragile 18-year-old boy goes to Rav Bina, it won&#039;t help him come closer to observance.

However, one who already had a healthy, personal connection to G-d and a personal commitment to Torah observance at age 18, will not suddenly go OTD because of one yeshiva experience.

It&#039;s disingenuous for the article to mention a few of these students are OTD, without giving more background information, and asking them what their emotional status re: Judaism was BEFORE attending Netiv Aryeh.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@twitter-56787055:disqus , @google-d8d35608565c5e4e6bb6bc569329fd95:disqus  is exactly right, abuse can be used to define many things in this country, in Israel however, people are generally tougher and so it would be viewed differently. And also, these things weren&#039;t necessarily crimes that required police involvement, they were psychological abuses that just needed some type of intervention.
In general your permitted attitude is analogous to frat boys defending their horrible hazing rituals. Or like graduates of British Public School&#039;s (= equivalent to US private schools) considering all the homoerotic actions that occur in the dorms against the freshmen are just a normal part of growing up in school. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My best guess is that the term &quot;abuse&quot; in Israel has a significantly different meaning and law associated with it. Also, when you&#039;re 18 years old - without your parents for the first time in your life (at an institution they sent you to), and the only authoritative figures are the ones perpetrating the alleged behaviors - exactly what are they supposed to do?

		<description><![CDATA[Daniel - it has nothing to do with him being perfect. No one expects him to be. But just because a man does fantastic, even holy things - doesn&#039;t excuse methodologies which many would (and do) claim to be verbal and physical abuse. I&#039;m not calling for his ouster - but the fact that you and many others seem to be blindly ignoring some of the obvious and serious allegations here reeks of stockholm syndrome. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If these men are abused in Netiv Aryeh how come no one has gone to the police? If there are any cases of real abuse they should be investigated and ANY rabbi including Rav Bina should be brought to justice and pay for his heinous crimes.

		<description><![CDATA[Were fat kids picked on? I guess if you have a vendetta against Rav Bina it can be considered &quot;picking on&quot;. What Brad fails to mention is that Rav Bina ENCOURAGED kids to lose weight, albeit in his unique fashion, with sets of shas and other types of prizes to get healthy and fit. Rav Bina is not perfect!! Rav Bina has very unorthodox methods for us spoiled Americans, but doesn&#039;t make him an abuser. As Brad noticed, the lack of evidence is deafening! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[huh?? Thats impossible because a lot of these types of stories happened to ME! Where did I deny the stories? I think that from a jewish perspective does halacha allow for anonymous articles like these?? If not then aren&#039;t we obligated to not believe them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Frankly, I&#039;m surprised at the LACK of evidence that was put in the story...considering that there is a staggering amount. It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if some of Rav Bina&#039;s former students are hesitant to come out against him for fear of the repercussions on their current livlihoods or community standing. But make no mistake about it - these are not just allegations. They are true. I am one of his &quot;victims&quot; - if you can even call it that. He cold-cocked me on the first tiyul we had on a Friday, simply because I hasn&#039;t shaved prior to Shabbat. Was it physical abuse? I don&#039;t know, it didn&#039;t leave a mark. Was it justifiable behavior? Absolutely not. What really wasn&#039;t discussed at length in the article was the emotional abuse he caused for those with weight problems, or those that had very elementary questions about G-d&#039;s existence - those students were simply called kofrim in public. 

I cannot deny the profound impact this man has had on other people&#039;s lives - but people also simply cannot ignore the downright disgusting things this man has done. ]]></description>

It&#039;s the man who is abusing his role as caretaker and authority figure that is being criticized, and rightfully so. ]]></description>
