		<description><![CDATA[Just came across this interesting source from Sefer Ha-ittim by R&quot;i Barceloni, who cites a letter from Shmuel ha-Naggid about the introduction of the written Talmud to Spain - written from memory:

נטרונאי נשיא בר חכינאי והוא שכתב לבני ספרד את התלמוד מפיו שלא מן הכתב למריבות 
והשלימו ביניהן שיהיו עוסקין בתלמוד

		<description><![CDATA[Ezra was their leader. He took them from exile and brought them back to the Holy Land and autonomy. His word was the law and the people listened to him. 
We don&#039;t know much about the Israelites before Ezra because what we do know is from Tanach and Tanach is not a history book. 
Clearly, idol worship and civil wars were a major part of their life during the First Temple.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s tons to say about the writing of the Mishna question, and I am truly impressed that you display such chochma as to find it astounding (i.e., you understand the difference).

Briefly, there are two versions of the Iggeret Rav Sherira, more or less called the Ashkenazic and the Sephardic rescension. The Ashkenazic one says that the Mishna was first written at the same time as the Gemara, and the Sephardic one has the Mishna literally written, not only arranged, by Rabbi Yehuda.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But they clearly all knew that this was the Torah that they were supposed to be keeping. Otherwise they wouldn&#039;t have gone along with Ezra. They wouldn&#039;t all have just believed him out of the blue. (You can fool some of the people some of the time but ...) It says explicitly that the Jews had never dwelt in sukkas before, which is pretty shocking.  But what about the rest of the Torah? What was going on in the meantime?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, so it seems I&#039;m reading too much into the quote. It just seems to say that Ezra was the originator of the substance that we call halacha, like Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Meir originated the substance of the Mishna, because the tradition was filtered through them and their opinions and their teachings. It doesn&#039;t clearly imply that they were the first to have systematic teachings, just that it is their particular strand of the oral tradition that survived, like one genetic line from several original ones.


Also, R Hertz refers to halacha there simply as popular practice, and that it was Ezra&#039;s take that was accepted.

But there is a reason that R Hertz chooses to introduce the entire concept of halacha with Ezra, suggesting some sort of shift in how the tradition of Moses was taught and practiced.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is much greater controversy, if I recall. I believe R Hertz mentions something about halacha not really existing in a systematic, clearly delineated form until after Ezra. Now, in some sense, halacha was clearly not as it is today until [the Mishna and the Gemara, the Rif and the] Rambam, and Tur Shulchan Aruch, but it still sounded rather thorny to me from a contemporary Orthodox perspective.


I&#039;ve heard that the Mishna was originally oral, and that it&#039;s genesis was complex, with several forms even before Rebbi, etc, but I&#039;d never imagined that it wasn&#039;t written down until the Geonim. Did the Geonim not possess manuscript Talmuds? Were there no manuscripts of the Mishna from the Roman and the Byzantine periods? Hard to believe the entire Talmud was oral until the 8th century.]]></description>
