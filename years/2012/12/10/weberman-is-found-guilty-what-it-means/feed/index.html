		<description><![CDATA[The Torah says that if a man seduces a young woman he has to pay her father and marry her. Do you think the man seduces the woman in front of witnesses? 

Even if the triple-lock was not true - and it certainly has not been established that he did not lock the door, you&#039;re just asserting that he didn&#039;t - the 12 hour road trip alone is established. Could his wife and kids have walked in at any moment? How did Weberman account for the purpose of the trip, much less every minute of it?



You reveal your real feelings when you say &quot;why should you be happy to have a yid die in prison&quot; - not an innocent man, a yid. His guilt or innocence means nothing to you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, I am surprised that you express your opinion without Torah backing.  Mr Weberman did not counsel the girl with a locked door.  Rules were established and his wife and kids were always there.   That a jury found him guilty shows nothing.  For them the torah way of a girl is supressing, regardless if she is Satmar or Vien.   There wasnt any &quot;Eidim&quot; that backed up her story.   She was believed in a true goyish way.  She impressed the goyim in her well demeanor, in her sticking to the points to this story.  And she surely looked better than the 54 year old  older guy.     The family supporting her are by now mostly not shomer shabbos.  They grew up chassidic and openly commited the worst sins until they moved out.   ALthough the girls parents were frum.    Why should you be happy to have a yid die in prison when many things point the other way.  To keep to her terms she had this motto for four days 
&quot;Every day, Every time , All three locks closed&quot;     When she was shown the impossible of this statement those days she shrugged her shoulders.   When the day comes which wont be in years , will be before and he comes out of prison, how do you thin youll  feel.  
I think you need to consider your beeing a rebbe]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To me, this verdict and trial is an encouragement. I was molested by my father, not in a religious-orthodox setting, I have been shunned by my familiy (not religious-orthodox) since the time I spoke out. I cannot go to court, status of limitations is over.

The fact that another victim has the courage to go to trial despite the intimidation, the bribing attemps, the ostracising by the community giver me great hope and satisfaction. It is to me as if my case was heard and accepted too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your balanced view. While he might have lost cheskas kashrus regarding many matters; it does not mean that he lost cheskas kashrut regarding this issue. He might  a thief but it does not mean that he automatically loses cheskas kashrut regarding these matters. For instance, one would not necesdsarily say, that a thief loses cheskas not being assumed a rotzeach. WE find that even in the same area, &quot;ein ossrin al hayichud&quot;, it does not create a level of doubt required to forbid the woman to he husband. In addition the other side does not necessarily have cheskas kashrut. So this case did a lot of good inti intimidating real culprits not to mess with terrible crime; but it certainly gives  them &quot;proof&quot; that they will not have a fair chance...and they will be convicted for lack of direct evidence, because the alleged victim is automatically beelived and the alleged abuser is automaticaly disbeleived without any DIRECT evidence (and no, there was no direct evidence of abuse, and he claimed it was not yichud because his wife was home and we have conflicting statements regarding the locks and the media convicted him from day one and she certainly had a vendetta so no evidence, nr even a chazakah that &quot;eyn odom meiz&quot; to make such claims for no reason whatseover).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry Rabbi Fink butI agree with Elliot Passik. Its inappropriate for you, as a rabbi, to cast suspicion on sex abuse cases with Rabbinic authorities as defendants. There&#039;s way too much rabbinic coverup that happened and continues to happen that you&#039;re alligning yourself with.

Rabbanim, even someone as veit from the corruption as you, are automatically cast into suspicion in my mind when they stand up for the authority figures over the victims. And while I appreciate your article, I don&#039;t blame elliot passik one bit for crying manipulation and ass covering.]]></description>

However, another thought: it is precisely because he has no clue who you are, reading it entirely in a vacuum, that he read this as yet another rabbi sweeps it under the rug. If your post could come across that way without further context - maybe it&#039;s food for thought?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,

I recently discovered your blog and have been really appreciating your refreshing outlook on things.


I agree with this article and I understand what the point of it is; I just want to add as a side note, that this case has been a HUGE CHILLUL HASHEM. (Besides for the obvious reasons) I am ashamed. Also, judging by the comments on secular news sites, people are quick to condemn all Jews based on this. That makes me sad. What Satmar (and others) are doing is unfair to themselves and to the other sects of Judaism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the question of physical evidence depends on a case. Certainly when there should have been physical evidence available to the prosecution, it is a valid defense to say, “Where is the physical evidence?” But in this sort of case there are good reasons why there is no physical evidence available. In these sorts of cases the burden of proof on the testimony and overall pattern consistent with the accusation rises. But in this case the evidence clearly met the burden of proof plus some.

Rabbi Fink, I wish you had been more nuanced in making it clear when the question of physical evidence is most concerning. I would also add what we both know, in the Frum world, the pressures against testifying are incredible, absolutely terrifying. So the willingness to go forward as a witness in a trial is usually indicative of more than in a community where victims are not ostracized and tortured for testifying.]]></description>
