		<description><![CDATA[Judaism does not teach altruism towards all people. Any student of the Talmud knows that non jews and disbelievers are discriminated against according to the law. Just to give a few examples; 1. a non jew who damages property of a jew must pay fullly whereas a jew who damages the property of a goy is patur.2. you are allowed to steal from a non jew, the only reason why we don\&#039;t is because of darchei shalom. 3. IF you see a non believer you should throw him in a pit. 4. The Torah itself calls for the destruction of whole nations including woman and children because of the sins of their ancestors. How does this fit in to your belief that Judaism preaches altruism towards all?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The denunciation of atheism, and showing how religion is morally
edifying and good for society. Everything I’ve seen or read of his seems to
have the goal of showing how religion provides practical benefits to society.
It’s probably a reaction to Dawkins and his group, who claim that religion is responsible
for most of the evil in the world and is terrible for society. But, to me, the
idea that one should be religious for pragmatic reasons, rather than because it’s
what God wants, is very strange. It’s like he’s tacitly admitting that the
atheists are right, God isn’t real, or at least, He doesn’t care, but you
should be religious because it has all these benefits for you and society. If
God is real and does care, then it doesn’t matter whether or not religion is
morally edifying. You do what God tells you because there really isn’t any
other choice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[\&quot;I wish that Rabbi Sacks would open the door for non-believers to be included in his article. In other words, Rabbi Sacks is implying that those without religion are doomed because their selfishness is bound to control them and eventually it could control and ultimately destroy society.\&quot;

Not true at all. He acknowledges that all of us have both selfish and group centered instincts. He simply argues that religion helps us move the latter to the forefront, because we associate ourselves deeply with our communities. (He also attributes it to \&quot;the rituals we perform, the texts we read and the prayers we pray\&quot; but I don\&#039;t see how that follows.)

The community element is crucial to his argument, and that\&#039;s why it\&#039;s an argument for religion. Other communal institutions would have the same effect, but few bind people together as well as mosques, churches and synagogues/temples. 


In effect, I see his argument as a parallel to Voltaires: \&quot;If religion did not exist, we would be advised to invent it.\&quot; (Interestingly, in a long discussion about moral realism yesterday, I pointed out that my interlocutors argument amounted to \&quot;If moral realism didn\&#039;t exist we would have to invent it.\&quot; Both claims are plausible, though neither is a philosophical argument for God or realism, simply a practical one.)

One response to Sacks is to propose closely knit humanist communities. Is that doable? It certainly works for some, though I can\&#039;t imagine it creates quite the sense of community that a church does. But the argument, as I see it, is that community builds social cohesion and therefore increased altruism, at least towards members of that community (how it impacts the relation towards outsiders is an important question to ask). But that doesn\&#039;t apply to \&quot;Atheism\&quot;, it applies to bowling groups and granfalloons in general.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven\&#039;t read the op-ed, but could offer the following response to your critique: While \&quot;unbelievers\&quot; are certainly capable of care for others and altruism, in some sense, such selflessness is morally lacking because it is in some sense selfish - an expression of the self, of one\&#039;s own desires and personal sense of right and wrong. The substance of such action is praiseworthy, but there is something lacking in the process by which an individual reaches the conclusion to act with altruism and focus on the other. When a \&quot;religious\&quot; individual acts with altruism and chessed out of a genuine sense of his being obligated to obey the external moral command of a morally superior Being who has the ability to normatively define right and wrong, his decision to obey that command and act towards others with altruism and selflessness is truly selfless, self-transcendent, and self-effacing. By contrast, when an \&quot;unbeliever\&quot; does the same act out of a personal sense that such conduct is morally correct (or socially utility-maximizing, or for some other self-generated reason), at bottom his is an act of self-aggrandizement. In the end, the distinction is illustrated by the maxim, \&quot;gadol ha-mitzaveh v\&#039;oseh memi she-eino metzuveh v\&#039;oseh.\&quot; Certainly we should aspire to have everyone act with appropriate altruism - tzedaka u\&#039;mishpat - but we should acknowledge that something morally valuable is lost when the right results are obtained through the wrong process.]]></description>
