		<description><![CDATA[The Chashmonaim refused to give up the monarchy because they couldn&#039;t integrate modernity? What&#039;s the link?  And there are numerous gemarahs warning against lay-people studying Chachma Yevanis as you well know, seemingly as the RMBM points out the point of scholars learning it was to adjudicate properly, but not to know.  


Overall, you seem to be trying too hard to fit the classical story into modern parlance and I dont find it convincing   Still, I&quot;m not satisfied with any other reasons why the Chasmonaim failed following this great victory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;  The Pharisees were the traditionalists. They believed that the Oral Tradition was Divine and binding. They were heavily representative of rabbis and members of the priestly class. A populist group also formed and they called themselves the Sadducees. They rejected the Oral Law and rabbinic authority. 

 

I don’t think that’s right. The rabbonim were Pharisees, but the Sadducees were kohanim,
and the kohanic aristocracy at that. The Pharisees were the populist movement, insisting
on things like that the average person needed to worry about tummah and tahara (the Sadducees said that it didn’t matter – just don’t go to the Beis HaMikdash if you’re taamie), that learning is as important as the avodah, that we’re judged in the afterlife, etc.


If anything, the Sadducees were the traditionalists. They were the guardians of the priestly religion of the Beis HaMikdash. It was the Pharisees who introduced concepts like Talmud
torah keneged kulam and Olam Habo (which is never mentioned in the Chumash).  



I love your take, but isn’t it just a vort? Is it really a possibility that the military victory was
downplayed to teach us we need to integrate Judaism with the culture we live in? It seems much more likely that a general dislike of the very Hellenized Chashmonaim, a move away from a militaristic culture during galus Bavel, and a recognition of the impermanence of the victory and it’s weakness as a reason for an annual holiday are why the miracle of the oil was invented.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A very novel way of looking at this story. Very Hirschian in approach. I wonder though, why would our sages focus on the war of the Chashmonaim in Al Hanisim if we are actually not supposed to emulate their intense and one track ways. And why praise them explicitly in Maoz Tzur?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By and large an interesting and open-minded
post but with many bad assumptions and/or untrue statements. I don’t have time
to fisk it all, but I would like to comment on the most egregious. It drives me
nuts whenever I speak (in learning too) to my fellow traditionalist/charedi
types and you repeated it here a few times.

Some quotes from your post..…


“they called themselves the Sadducees. They rejected the Oral Law”
…Me:  absolutely misleading

“the Sadducees rejected tradition”. Me: Absolutely not true

“The Pharisees were the traditionalists. They believed that the Oral Tradition was Divine and binding.”…Me: so did the Sadducees.

Here is the fact. 

In that period, as you well know, there were many sects, Essenes, Zealots, Qumran sect, etc. Basically, they ALL adhered to the Torah and they ALL must have had an Oral Tradition. As
you well realize, the Written Torah is pretty useless as a core religious document without a full sized translation/interpretation/tradition. That’s a fact.

What you must have meant and the Gemorrah should’ve written is that they (Sadducees) didn’t keep the same Oral tradition recorded by the Mishna. In fact the Mishna itself records thousands of disputes, resulting in a multi-faceted Oral tradition.

So, truthfully, who really knows which was the most authentic oral interpretation/tradition of the Torah.

And if you believe that our (Shuchan Orech, Rambam, etc.) version is the one going back to Sinai…well…]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s doubtful that there were Sadducees and Pharisees at this time. Tha Hasmonean&#039;s religious inclinations are difficult to ascertain. neither from zadokite priestly clan nor davidic dynasty is problematic. The constant exposure to ritual impurity - death - is a biblical no no.they were traditionalist of a sort and upheld the Torah as the constitution of judea. They also stood for integration as well - or hellinization. Even Judah the macabi counted the most culturally hellenized Jews among his partisans. What they did show was the ability to adopt Greek culture could function in an Hellenistic world to preserve a native - judean - culture. Mordern orthodoxy&#039;s beginnings anyone?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;But in the end there was no choice. The Hasmoneans led a spirited rebellion and after 25 years of war eventually vanquished the Greeks.&quot;


My understanding was that they were all too happy to kill the Hellenized Jews and that the war was more of a civil war than a war against the Greeks.  It was almost that the Greeks were a proxy in the civil war. No?]]></description>
