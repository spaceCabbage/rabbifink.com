		<description><![CDATA[I like your description in your 2010 post as a &quot;recovering dog hater&quot;.  My brother is a fully recovered dog hater, who was literally terrified of dogs as a child, but today, along with his wife, owns and loves 2 dogs.


I am not so enthusiastic about dogs myself, but my son has been an unabashed dog lover literally his entire life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(1) It hasnt reached the litvish world yet to treat their own that way, but they are just as sycophantic about visiting rebbes as anyone else. One of the Mafia Toldos rebbes show up in NY and every down hat guy trips over themselves to see and throw money at them. 


(2) litvoks really have taken on a lot of those ideas even about their own, ie caring to shake their hands, asking for brachos, asking advise outside of a kasha on a gemorah. These people are scholars, book people, that is all. but litvoks have begun treating them like rebbes. 


Yitzchok Hutner may be responsible for the crossover.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fabulous. 

_______________

&lt;b&gt;Normally we associate great rabbis with Torah scholarship and intellectual or spiritual prowess.&lt;/b&gt;

Most of the Orthodox world associate great rabbis with numbers of followers, perceived wealth, ie fur coats, silver canes,, how many assistance they have, and who their father happens to be. Whether the guy has ever cracked open a gemorah is irrelevant. And certainly, any semblance of piety, humility, selflessness, dedication to the Jewish people, is not required at all.]]></description>
