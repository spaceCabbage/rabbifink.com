		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I guess they did start reporting on the trial by Day 4 so if that&#039;s what you mean by keeping their readers informed, you&#039;re right that they didn&#039;t ignore its existence entirely.

I don&#039;t think they did a fine job.  I think they did the minimum job they needed to do but tried to leave out most of the details so that they wouldn&#039;t alienate their charedi readership.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;VIN reported extensively on the trial. The comments are predictably erratic. But the site did a good job keeping their readers informed.&quot;

Not exactly.  They had four articles on the trial, two of them about the picture takers and one about the Satmar Rebbe.  Maybe 5-6 paragraphs about the testimony, total.  Nobody following the trial counted on them for their coverage.  Do you have access to some secret VIN content that the rest of us don&#039;t?

Contrast this with the New York Daily News, who hands down had the best coverage of the trial. They had a thorough summary at the end of each day&#039;s testimony, and a reporter (Oren Yaniv) in the courtroom live-tweeting every new development as it happened.  Some days there were two articles about the trial, by different reporters.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking as someone who has never owned a media entity, this is the way I see the challenge.


In a sense, deciding what is relevant and irrelevant to a story takes a certain bias. We tend to equate fact with truth, but looking at facts is a very superficial truth which can sometimes be worse than a lie.


Look at the issue of Lashon Hara - said to be worse than Motzi Shem Ra. Why should this be? When I talk about someone and point out a negative in the process, what happens is that the person (or community) is being defined to the audience based on the negative. At that moment, my listener is making a judgment based on my sizing up the situation. In effect, I am using a manipulated truth to create a lie. Whether I am doing this spitefully or innocently is irrelevant.


This is the challenge of the news. The report may be focused on the specifics, but how will reading it not paint how we view the community as a whole? And if our view is now colored mostly by this case and not taking everything into consideration, then perhaps a falsehood is being communicated. 


I am not suggesting that therefore there is no room for it. I am just putting forth why I think that right and wrong in the arena of journalism is not as clear as we think we see it. Where to draw the fine line is a responsible decision that has to be made by someone with far greater vision and judgment than I have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[VIN is a flagrant violator of Loshon Hora... on a constant basis. Without a doubt, it qualifies as Choti U&#039;machti Es Harabim.  It should be shut down and its sponsors should be boycotted. YWN and Matzav are a lot more discriminating about what they publish. Whether or not this case is sufficient to warrant a Heter such as Apay Tlusa and/or preventing Hezek is one for a qualified Posek.]]></description>
