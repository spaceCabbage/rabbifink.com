		<description><![CDATA[I have no idea what religious community Rabbi Feldman is describing; but it isn\&#039;t any kind of Orthodox Jewish community I\&#039;ve ever seen.

Who doesn\&#039;t invite non-frum Jews into their homes?  Who doesn\&#039;t live a life of \&quot;connection\&quot; and \&quot;confidence\&quot; ?

Who is Xenophobic?

If there are such communities, they are by definition not shomrei mitzvot - since khesed, dveikus, and ahavas yisrael are all required by halakha.

If there are such communities, it sounds like THEY need kiruv.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;In my opinion, this is so true. In some orthodox circles, the non-orthodox are heathen, God hating, anti-Semites. This is a lie. Maybe part of why Kiruv has become so hard is because they know what we think of them…&lt;/i&gt;


Another reason that kiruv is so hard is because of a different set of lies. Lies both of commission (the silly proofs, medrash as truth, etc) and of omission (not letting kiruv candidates know that the \&quot;required\&quot; items for acceptance in the frum community are likely to bankrupt them, or at least near-bankrupt them).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R. Fink, I must agree with Kman. I have been following your blog for some time and it is patently and consistently anti the haredi community, i.e. anyone to the right of &quot;modern orthodoxy&quot;. The title of this post is an excellent case in point. &quot;One Excellent Article in Klal Perspectives.&quot; There are almost 20 essays in that journal -  and only one is excellent? Seventeen haredi rabbis and layleaders put out a journal and only one of them can write a good article?! That doesn&#039;t say much for haredi leadership. A more neutral title would have been &quot;An Excellent Article in Klal Perspectives&quot; - a title which highlights the article you proceed to discuss without knocking the rest of them. Though I do not know the criteria you employed in evaluating this &quot;excellent&quot; article, I am certain that among them is severe criticism of haredim.

You are certainly correct in your disdain for &quot;xenophobia, arrogance, and insularity,&quot; but your remarkable ability to notice those traits in the haredi community alone when in reality they exist everywhere is a clear indication of your disdain for the community.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He&#039;s spot on.I live in a community where my family is one of a handful of shomer shabbat Jews. This is the term I use. Most Jews in my community aren&#039;t &quot;non-observant&quot;. They take very seriously the bein adam l&#039;chaveiro mitzvot and they are perfectly happy in their observances. They are far from ignorant.

A kiruv professional who spent an extended amount of time here once remarked that the Jews here just don&#039;t want to push themselves to grow. Au contraire. They are growing - according to their own beliefs and practices. The idea that the Torah is not exactly directly from Sinai is considered mainstream here. Ergo, why bother with super-strict beliefs? They simply have a different view of the world and their place in it. Also, many are intermarried which presents a whole host of other issues. 

In any case, I&#039;m told the February 2013 edition of Rabbi Angel&#039;s journal Conversations is centered around the topic of Bible Criticism. FYI.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Daniel, I don&#039;t mean to be rude but you proved my point.

You replied, &quot;we&#039;re clearly talking about the Yeshivish community here.&quot; The frum world, even the yeshivish community is not monolithic, yet bloggers tend to brush us all with the same stroke and that is really frustrating.

		<description><![CDATA[In my experience, it&#039;s more than even a cultural divide. It&#039;s not  just a matter of being conditioned, culturally, to believe that the non-observant lead empty lives. Nor is it just a matter of the frum Jew forcing oneself to believe he leads the fulfilled life to justify the demands he puts on himself (or subjects himself to).

Rather, I vividly recall being taught in Yeshiva, in explicit terms, that &quot;their&quot; lives are empty. That they look happy, but they are not. That they pursue pleasures to distract themselves from their dreary, worthless existence. While we, who toil day and night in Torah, are the only ones experiencing true joy.

It sounds silly, but when you hear it day in, day out, during your teenage years, it starts 
to sink in. Even if you don&#039;t totally buy it with your frontal lobe, your inner self believes it.

So when that type of instruction informs your spiritual development, what hope is there to 
relate to a non-observant person? Reaching out to him, or even refraining from looking down at him, becomes nearly impossible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course the flaws he and you discuss exist in the community. The frum community today and since time immemorial has had serious flaws. The difference is that productive people acknowledge flaws yet try to work from within and correct the issues, while accentuating and building on the many positives that do exist (Which R&#039; Feldman does do quite well). While the bloggers like you constantly bash and seem to enjoy pointing out every negative that there is. But you love the frum world. I&#039;m sure some of your best friends are....


To paraphrase Winston Churchill (I believe), our frum community is the worst community out there, except every other community around.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read Rabbi Edelstein&#039;s article. It was not good at all. If you want me to tell why I didn&#039;t like it, I can.


I started Rabbi Butler&#039;s but it didn&#039;t really catch my interest.


You completely misread everything about me. I love the frum community and I want it to be successful. My disdain is for xenophobia, arrogance, and insularity. Rabbi Feldman is not bashing the frum community, he is saying that in order to do outreach properly we need to fix our flaws.


Do you disagree with any of the flaws he discussed?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s very hard for the Orthodox Jew to admit that non-Orthodox Jews are doing fine with their lesser level of ritual observance.  The Orthodox Jew sacrifices so much time and money to ritual.  There must be a commensurate benefit, right?  

And even if the Orthodox Jew sees fulfilled, committed non-Orthodox Jew, he can still feel superior since he (supposedly) doesn&#039;t have to worry about his kids intermarrying.

It&#039;s sad, but probably human nature, that people need to look down on others to feel better about themselves (though I think chazal caution against this mindset).]]></description>
