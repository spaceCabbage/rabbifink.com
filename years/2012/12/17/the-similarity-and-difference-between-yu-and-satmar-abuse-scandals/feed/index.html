		<description><![CDATA[Even if knowledge about how to handle sexual abuse was just becoming known in the 1970s and 1980s, let&#039;s not forget that Norman Lamm was Chancellor of a research university which included graduate schools of medicine, psychology and social work.  Surely there were experts on staff he could have consulted about how to handle multiple allegations of abuse.  

Now it&#039;s being made out like he was a rosh yeshiva.  Sure he was rosh yeshiva, but he was also Chancellor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I checked in with a regular legal practitioner in the field, who confirmed that New York&#039;s mandated reporting law only applies to a &quot;person legally responsible&quot; for the child, and that term only includes the child&#039;s custodian, guardian, or any other person responsible for the child&#039;s care.  That mostly means a parent, or similar guardian, and does not mean a private school teacher.  The private school mental health professional is not mandated to report abuse inflicted by a private school teacher on a child.  The law needs to be changed.  (The laws in other states are sometimes broader.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The mandated reporting statutes can be a little tricky to figure out.


Even today, it is only in about 26 states that clergy are actual mandated reporters.  NY is definitely not one of them.


Also, NY&#039;s mandated reporting statute (Soc Serv Law 413) only requires that parent-to-child, or guardian-to-child abuse gets reported;  not teacher to student.  So the Finkelstein and Gordon cases wouldn&#039;t be covered by 413, even if it was effective in those days, and I&#039;m not sure if it was.


Starting in 2001, a new  law came in effect in NY (in the state Educ Law), applicable to public schools only, requiring the public schools to report teacher-to-student abuse.  This law also doesn&#039;t apply to the YU High School situation.


We&#039;re trying to get these laws changed.  But its slow going, and you can imagine who&#039;s against us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It does not appear that YU High School violated New York&#039;s mandated reporting laws.  These laws, even today, do not require a private school to report to the government that one of their teachers abused a student.   http://www.p12.nysed.gov/nonpub/running/qa-mandated-reporters.html    Notably, none of the Forward articles claim that the letter of the law was violated.

Indeed, it can be argued that if YU High School had informed child protection authorities, absent the consent of the parents of the victims, that&#039;s a breach of privacy and confidentiality.

The heart of the problem lies in not informing subsequent schools, like the Florida day school that Finkelstein went to, of the history of abuse.  That&#039;s certainly wrong, from both a religious and ethical viewpoint.

Additionally, it behooves any school, like YU HS, to immediately investigate such abuse claims, and if true, the Finkelsteins and Gordons need to be immediately fired.  Any delay furthers the risk of harm.

All states have child endangerment criminal statutes. Finally, we&#039;re now beginning to see prosecutions of private school supervisors, even senior clergy, who knowingly employ sex molesters in their schools.  However, you didn&#039;t see any of these prosecutions years ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Makes no sense.  The facts about when reporting became mandatory are being brought to show when awareness of sexual abuse as a problem became widespread.  So you have a guy who was known to abuse guys in the 70s and 80s.  Now it&#039;s the 90s and everyone knows abuse is bad.  You keep him around because there are no fresh allegations being brought?  Or you look at the facts in retrospect, decide the guy is bad news, and let him go?

		<description><![CDATA[http://sogpubs.unc.edu//electronicversions/pdfs/rca/ch2.pdf?

From what i understand in this article, 1971 was the first time reporting suspicions of abuse  ever became mandatory, but it was only for professionals and if you refer to the footnote then you will see that that DID NOT include teachers or school faculty rather it included doctors... dentists..etc

In 1979 this law was amended to include all citizens  and thus anyone that suspected child abuse at this point was obligated to report...
Now that being said, this law was only passed literally during the time that the alleged abuse was happening in YU.
I am not saying they should ont report I am just saying form these context, and knowing how long it takes for these kind of laws to truly impact society and its view on abuse, then blaming YU for not reporting seems to be holding them up to a higher standard then almost any other school at that time. Again. I think they should have reported but, for their time, they were responding no differently then probably any other school would respond.]]></description>
