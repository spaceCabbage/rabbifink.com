		<description><![CDATA[I think this actually dovetails with our tradition. I think so because of what you mention in your last paragraph first of all. Additionally, in our tradition, witnessing the crime does not establish fact. It establishes acceptable testimony for judges to hear. 

If the Beit Din itself actually witnessed the event, are they not disqualified from judging the case (in capital cases at least)? The Torah states &quot;V&#039;Hitzilu HaEidah&quot; which does not allow a judge who already &quot;knows&quot; what happened from judging the case. If a case is open and shut and therefore a unanimous decision, then that is not considered real justice. What comes out is that it has to be that despite the eyewitness account, at least 1 judge is not taking the account as fact of what happened.

What gives consolation about the Beit Din system is that ultimately it is G-d who is the ultimate Judge. The judges are only there to be accountable for there own ability to judge within the system, not for the actual carrying out of Divine Justice itself.]]></description>
