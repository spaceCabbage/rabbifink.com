Well, that&#039;s not at all a prejudicial generalization, is it. I&#039;m glad your social life is so joyful and progressive. Maybe YOU should be the one proselytising.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I kept being grated by this term &#039;kiruv professional&#039;. And then it hit me; you are getting PAID to do this? You see, my experience as a Chabadnik, is that, although there is a central spiritual source, i.e. the Lubavitcher Rebbes and their teachings, Tanya, Chassidus etc, there is no central financial organisation. Each little rabbi in each Chabad house has to be financially autonomous, he has to be his own fundraiser. He and the rebbetzin are not getting paid, they are not &#039;kiruv professionals&#039;. They just want to reconnect Jews with the joy and meaning of Judaism. So your goal is, essentially, to emulate the Chabad approach. And I also agree that even Chabad is a bit sketchy on the support of the newly minted BT and his/her challenges once he/she becomes &#039;frum&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have great respect for this approach - ones success in kiruv (from my perspective) should not be measured in how many one can mikareiv, if this is the case - it can often be deduced that the kiruv worker is not giving, or has not given the person they have formed a kesher with an honest and profound foundation for understanding who they are as a jew and where they wish to go with their judaism. Furthermore - I have to agree that Kiruv when employed in the way discussed above is an effective tool for dialogue in the Jewish community. Once again much hatslacha - given me a lot to ponder on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just this morning I&#039;ve read your wise and clarfying  thoughts - response to 3 very confusing questions on orthodox Judaism. I am a 75 years old preschool learner of Torah and Talmud. Slowly I integrate into mitzvos&#039; dimensions and many new commanding views slowly open to me from an eternal Temple of wisdom. Thank you, Rabbi Fink, for guiding my enlightenment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very beautiful article on kiruv and I believe spot on. I didnt finish the whole klal perceptive but I really dont need to hear anymore. I would add the following to what you started. There is a sad reality in right-wing orthodoxy to be \&quot;mikariv\&quot; outsiders but never to fully accept them as equal within. I dont think I need to go into specifics but I think we all know this. I attended Rabbi Dovid Orlofsky kiruv classes and they were great training. One thing he spoke about was the trend among some of us to have a kiruv project. Meaning making someone frum just so you can show off to others as an accomplishment. \&quot;Hey guys this is my kiruv project, have you met him yet?!\&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[wow. If only this weren\&#039;t true, my siblings and I wouldn\&#039;t have suffered so much. My parents were a great target for kiruv, they were needy and they gave them attention at the right time. Once they became frum, they completely forgotten about and left to figure out their lives, now with the added pressure of being frum. After 30 years they are still confused and know very little about Judaism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your making a big mistake. If you believe deeply in your way of life than you should want to share it with others. I understand your concern with some that do it for their own glory but that shouldnt stop people like Rabbi Fink that just want to give them something positive in their lives.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The issues you address in section 2 \&quot;II. Measuring Success\&quot; speak as much to the way we view ourselves and the way we teach our own children as they do to the way we do kiruv. 
I\&#039;m reminded of something the Gaon allegedly told R\&#039; Chaim Volozhiner about when he would be ready to teach others what he knows \&quot;you should be like a jug that overflows and spills into the little jars below yourself, you shouldn\&#039;t have to force it out, it comes naturally once you\&#039;re overflowing with knowledge\&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Orthodox Judaism as it exists presently is not something I\&#039;d wish for anyone to join. It\&#039;s bad enough already Orthodox parents must raise their children in this seven-cardinal-sins environment. 

If someone is a loner or social outcast and seeks out a group to join and ends up here I wouldn\&#039;t stop him or her, however, I am not a fan of Kiruv proselytizing. Leave people alone, let them live the lives they were born into. A guy is 20, brought up by his parents with hopes and dreams, and he gets caught up with a college rabbi and ends up in Israel with a beard, often tearing apart not just his life but that of his entire family. 

If Orthodox social life wasn\&#039;t so backwards and miserable I wouldn\&#039;t really have a problem with it though.]]></description>
