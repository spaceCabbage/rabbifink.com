		<description><![CDATA[What I find strange is that Tosfos took the Gemarah&#039;s statement to be halachic at all.  It isn&#039;t the Torah Temimah&#039;s interpretation that is surprising  its Tosfos&#039;.  Correct me if I am wrong (and I have certainly not done the research - I&#039;m just relying on my gut informed by whatever Torah I have somehow managed to ingrain through osmosis), but statements like &quot;it is better to suffer X (something really bad) than do XYZ&quot; are always aggadic, and emphasize the importance of that which otherwise might be ignored rather than teach hard and fast halachic rules.  Such statements are normally taken as establishing halachic principles that might be used to mediate among competing halachic rules in particular hard cases.

What really need a birur is Tosfos&#039; interpretation.  Is this kind of construction typical of Tosfos; do the Baalei Tosfos construct other similar Gemaros this way?  Is there something special about the context or structure of this passage that leads Tosfos to this understanding?]]></description>
