		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting interpretation, and I think it rings true in light of Shimon and Levi&#039;s challenge to their father after Yaakov chastises them for taking out Shechem et al- &quot;Will YOU make a harlot of our sister???&quot; And note that that&#039;s the end of the story, no answer from Yaakov. Shetika Kehoda&#039;a, right? Maybe Yaakov acknowledges that it WAS, in fact, his fault. 


Love your blog BTW.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rav Volbe (and others) often write how the Avos were aware of direct causality of their actions to the future of klal yisroel (i.e. Avraham had to go to Egypt and leave with wealth so that BN&quot;Y could as well etc).  Perhaps here he&#039;s saying Yaakov had to (chose to) hate Eisav, for a similar reasoning.  Thought process isn&#039;t complete, but hard to accept a middah like hatred completely overtaking Yaakov.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I’d definitely never heard this one before. Naturally, the story of Yonah immediately leaps to mind. The Torah definitely doesn’t like it when we don’t give sinners a chance to do teshuva…

Somewhat off-topic, it’s pretty amazing, when you think about it, how good we are at maintaining our cognitive dissonance over the &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; troubling issues when we know that that’s just how the Torah works. Here we are expressing amazement that Yaakov could be depicted as hating Eisav, while the idea that Dinah’s rape was &lt;i&gt;Yaakov’s&lt;/i&gt; punishment goes unremarked upon. To a modern-day set of eyes, this is a surpassingly offensive notion, but we somehow can make our peace with it (back then all women just wanted to get married one way or another, the Torah understands women in ways we don&#039;t, etc., etc.).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; The verse says that Yaakov and his eleven children prepared for the encounter. Rashi
quotes the famous Midrash that asks “where was Dina?” 

Dina’s a girl. Girls don’t count. A little more generously, women didn’t fight.

It’s certainly an unusual interpretation. But without the midrashim, Eisav isn’t such a bad guy, and Yaakov is no saint. I think that the midrashim got the archytypes wrong. Yaakov is a trickster, not a tzaddik, and Eisav is a hunter, not a rasha. Eisav never does anything bad to Yaakov until after the brachos are stolen from him, and even then, he eventually relents and
kisses his brother (which the midrashim have to make evil by saying that he was trying to bite Yaakov, but that’s not what the pasuk says). Yaakov, on the other hand, extorts the bechora from Eisav, then lies to Ytizchak and steals the brachos fom Eisav.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another explanation could be that Eisav had good yichus (the best) and therefore Yaakov should have at least given him a chance with Dina.


Could also say that Yaakov had enough wisdom to realize that a woman cannot change a man permanently (though they always seem to attempt it).]]></description>
