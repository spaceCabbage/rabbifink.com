In response, I actually think that a mechitza is discriminatory. But its value is more important than concern for that discrimination. A seperate bus is NOT valuable enough to discriminate. It is also public transport, not a private shul.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was on a sherut in israel when a charedi man (I am charedi also) asked me if my wife would sit at the back, my answer to him was, the Mitzvah to not look at women applies to you not to my wife, if you cannot keep your eyes in the right place open up a sefer (book) and learn! 

Also in respect to this Rav Eliashiv the Posek Hador (Halachic cheif Rabbi) has stated that &quot;that gender segregation is not an area that can be enforced in the public realm&quot; such as a bus

I deplore the actions of this small sect of people who are trying to enforce these stringencies on secular, modern othodox and also charedi people and it is time we stood upto them as they are a chillul Hashem

however,  I find the logic that you brought in your article to be flawed in section 1) &quot; “separate but equal” is inherently discriminatory&quot; That would mean that the Mechitza in your shul is also discriminatory! 

I agree there is no halachic basis for the separaeted public buses and I am against them but likewise using the logic above you would have to take down your Mechitza in Your shul

The reason why the separate public buses is wrong because a) there is not halachic basis 2) they are trying to enforce upon others a chumra or stringency, this something that is a matter of personal choice not for others to enforce 3) the way this sect is choosing to enforce it breaks many areas of halacha (jewish law) a) The Mitzvah of Loving your neighbor as yourself b) the Mitzvah of Tochacha (rebuke) has to be delivered in a way that it will be received and delivered with love (both of these are clearly not happening) c) They are causing physical and emotional damage a matter of chosen mishpat (laws of damages) and lastly this is a matter of Chillul HaShem decreation of G-d&#039;s name and will drive people away from Torah and not closer to it

In response Torah leaders are coming out to admonish this small sect &quot;Speaking at Chanukah candle lighting, the Belzer Rebbe Shlita released a
 statement against the escalating violence from within the chareidi community. The rebbe stated “If there are those among us who believe they 
will spread the light of Yiddishkheit through violence, they are 
mistaken”.

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, the segregated buses do cause hardship. Many people get sick on buses unless they sit near the front. Pregnant women especially get sick on buses. Since a significant percentage of the passengers on any haredi bus line are probably pregnant, that&#039;s a very relevant consideration. Second, the air-conditioning tends to be totally ineffective except at the front of the bus, and Israeli summers -- especially on a stuffy bus -- are hot. 

Finally, you claim that &quot;nobody claims this is halacha.&quot; Actually, that claim is indeed being made, and the more widespread such buses become, the more widely the claim is likely to be believed. All sorts of practices that were once considered chumras have become de rigeur. If there are two opinions on a halachic issue and the more machmir opinion is commonly followed, it becomes assumed that no other opinion is acceptable. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did respond to all the issues presented by  the article, in my original post above. 

And you responded with irrelevant arguments against chareidim who shove on buses. 

And accusations of wanting to &quot;control.&quot; Yes, the williamsburg bus is about control. Control over the goyim who never heard of it. Control over the women who could just as easily take the MTA&#039;s buses. Control over you. 

I will now respond to your point about chareidim who take the unseparate subway:
Nobody claims this is halacha. It is a chumrah, which means it is balanced against other considerations. Since there is no hardship at all caused by separate buses, there is no reason to not do it, except that it makes you mad- which is not a reason. However, if I need to go on the subway, then I can do it. And so can my wife take the subway- there is no unequal treatment in this. 

Your point that the chareidim should walk is answered the same way- there is no hardship caused by separate seating- there is by having to walk everywhere. 

Your points about shoving on buses are not relevant. At all. Perhaps you mean they shove against women, which you don&#039;t say. If that is so, I don&#039;t think they should be doing that. And it is another good reason for separate busing. 
But, it certainly doesn&#039;t prove that the motive is control, since if so, they wouldn&#039;t make things like monsey trails and the williamsburg bus. And you can&#039;t say that because some of them really don&#039;t care about touching women, therefore nobody does. It makes more sense to say that some of them are really not as frum as they act to fit in with their neighbors- something you might be familiar with. 

Now I will respond to you, who makes up ridiculous theories (control) to justify his accusations against chareidim. 
It is called that someone makes you feel guilty. 
There is no other human explanation for why usually rational people all over the internet are jumping over each other to make up the most bizarre explanations, just so that they can allege bad faith. 

And you can&#039;t claim the high moral ground in this argument, just because I called you names. Not when you guys are waving around the irrelevant Rosa Parks. (And just be happy Rosa Parks wasn&#039;t in a segregated church, or Hillary would be knocking on your shul door and calling you racist.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4164472,00.html

See this. Apparently the Court&#039;s ruling is understood to apply to any bus company. They are trying to get around it by making the new bus line free, but it is unclear if that will be allowed.

I got the line about them having previously tried to make a separate company from a different website, I am trying to confirm it. 

In any event, they definitely did make arrangements with egged previously, to operate separate &quot;mehadrin&quot; lines, where the rule was separate seating. These bus lines were made illegal by the Court. 
I see no difference between making your own company, and making a deal with the current company to operate certain buses as mehadrin buses. In either event, they are doing it through business arrangements, which don&#039;t prejudice anyone else. And that is what the Court didn&#039;t allow. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is factually incorrect.

Charedim weren&#039;t prevented from making their own bus company.  

The Israeli Supreme Court said that Egged bus lines (the largest public bus company) can&#039;t enforce segregation on bus lines, even if it is desired by most of the riders, of both genders.

In fact, just like Monsey Trails and other Jewish buses in the United States, the answer for the Charedi community might very well be a private bus line.

http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4164472,00.html 

One already operates to and from the Charedi enclave of Beitar Illit.  I&#039;ve never heard of anyone complaining about segregation there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If that was really the motivation, much of Yerushalayim is walkable. If it was really THAT important, you&#039;d see many Charedim walking and not taking the bus within Yerushalyim.
By the way, stand near the Kosel stop outside the Old City walls and watch Charedim push and shove onto the number 1 bus into very tight quarters rather than wait for the next bus. Happens all the time. Watch!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you been on the very crowded Jerusalem Light Rail when it was free only to see many Charedim stuff themselves into these very crowded spaces? They could have walked or taken the buses (you had to pay) yet they pushed on in droves.
Why don&#039;t Charedim avoid New York City subways especially during rush hours and take their own private buses into Manhattan?
This is a power play for control by Charedim and nothing to do with Halacha.

Why don&#8217;t Charedim avoid New York City subways especially during rush hours and take their own private buses into Manhattan?<br />
This is a power play for control by Charedim and nothing to do with Halacha.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[So your problems are:
1. They are illegal. Nice one. Shechita is illegal in many countries, and bris milah was almost illegal in California. They tried to make their own bus company, and the Israeli government/egged prohibited it.  
2. It isn&#039;t halachically necessary. Ok. But, that is not a reason against it. 
3. It sends a bad message. Well, I am not particularly concerned about the message people get, who aren&#039;t looking to understand. Like you for example. 

4. Your big reason. That it says we are highly sxualized and even a chance encounter is enough to get us going. Well, seems to me that most men agree with that notion. Tell me with a straight face that sitting next to a really hot girl dressed to kill doesn&#039;t affect you at all. After all, it is just riding a bus, it isn&#039;t like she offered to go out with you. 

The fact remains, that nobody who is trying to keep halacha, has ever criticized their motivations. (I mean including the halacha that men cannot get sxual gratification from looking at or thinking about women besides their wives who are an ervah- including a nidda.) 

You can say that you think having separate buses is too much of a bother, and it is just a necessary part of life to sit next to women on the bus. And I will respect that. Tznius is a balance. But you can&#039;t criticize the motivation. ]]></description>

&quot;They are halachically unnecessary. Halachically speaking, there is no requirement for segregation between men and women.&quot;

But R&#039; Moshe isn&#039;t saying that it&#039;s ok for buses to initially be designed this way, he&#039;s just saying that it would not be forbidden to ride on such a bus.... but wouldn&#039;t he agree that l&#039;chatchila buses SHOULD be segregated (from a halachic standpoint)?]]></description>
