		<description><![CDATA[Jerry can waive appeals and find the sanction he received was appropriate and that he will not continue to appeal it, because that would mean he doesn&#039;t find it apprpriate, when, in fact, he and the jury and, very likely, most of society does, as well.

The jury has spoken and Jerry concers with their judgement.

The sanctity of life is the reason that the death penalty is invoked. When an innocent life is intentionally destroyed, the guilty party has forfieted their right to live, because the violation is so great.

All sanctions are based upon taking away that which is valued, be it money (fines), time and labor (community service), freedom (incarceration) and life (execution).

The waiving of appeals enhances the just aspect of the sanction. Rarely do criminals have the moral awareness to waive appeals. There only concern is besting the system, as much as they can, to avid as much sanction as possible. Only an honorable criminal will have the awareness to waive their appeals.

Waiving appeals is part of the proper procedure, that is why all of those convicted have the option of appealing, or not, at their discretion. The law, the courts and procedure all respect the ability of those convicted to waive appeals, as they should.

Improperly all states require the first round of death penalty appeals, but not successive ones. That should be up to the convicted party.

There can be no reason that justice should not be done.

		<description><![CDATA[In general I think I agree with you. What happens if they waive any appeals?

&gt;but that is a completely different topic.
Then why bring it up? :) I don&#039;t see how a religious court wouldn&#039;t be flawed either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I liken this to Death with Dignity laws.  A death row inmate who has exhausted (or declined) all of his options or appeals is akin to a terminally ill person.  That person should have the right to make the choice on how he or she goes out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you are missing a key point: from the perspective of the state, due process has been achieved: he has been tried, convicted and legally sentenced.  There are many aspects of this that are his choice: he could have chosen to plead guilty, or not mount any significant defense at trial.  He can choose not to avail himself of any any appeals, which is fine.  There&#039;s no mandate that a death row inmante *must* appeal.  If he is to be executed, which he is, and he is at peace with the decision and his own death, then delaying it is a worse punishment than just doing it.  One that would even be cruel.]]></description>
