		<description><![CDATA[&quot;When Matisyahu announced he had shaved, I was actually proud of him. To me, it meant that he was thinking critically about his Judaism and felt a beard was not necessary or integral to his love and service of God. I agree.&quot;

So Finky it&#039;s now two years later and we all know what&#039;s happened to Matisyahu. Are you still actually proud of him?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a connection between shaving and tattoos, at least based on their placement in Vayikra.  So why is the d&#039;orita prohibition on shaving not implicated by using an electric instrument (only a traditional blade), but  the same leniency does not apply to the (generally) d&#039;rabanan ban on tattoos? Do broader socie
tal and cultural conventions play a role in the disparity?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right its not about the beard, but there is a lot more here than meets the eye. In case you missed his tweet about his favorite masseuse in NYC who also writes sex tips in penthouse magazine.(google matisyahu Dr. Dot and check out the pic).  Its not that frum people dont do avairos it&#039;s just that usually we are embarrassed . But im sure the touring and hedonistic lifestyle practiced by most musicians was hard to constantly turn down. He is trying to break away as is evident from his more recent concerts where is visibly high and curses on stage.  My guess is that his wife gave him an ultimatum and he chose music. So I think before you start placing your stamp of approval on his actions you might want to think about his poor wife and kids who for some reason moved to LA even though he records in Brooklyn and she is part of the crown heights community. It&#039;s obvious she is dead embarrassed of him and needs to shelter their kids. I hope im way off on this but if you ever saw his wife she does not look like she is married to a pot smoking masseuse client.  ]]></description>

  Ok, you&#039;ve pushed me over the edge. you are officially an ass. Shame on you
  Eli, you are a disgrace to your kehilla @makeforyourself

Making fun of it? All because you want to be as lenient as possible? Why did you become a rabbi?  

I will certainly make sure EVERYONE I know sees this.I am a public figure, you can&#039;t embarrass me with my own words, I weigh them carefully before I post them, You, on the other hand, seem to have no control over what you write.

Again, I am sorry for those who you influence. They deserve better. Please continue
to have this discussion, but without me. It&#039;s obvious that you are part of those who called themselves Misnagdim, so any discussion with you will take on that angle and will never be a true shaklah v&#039;tarya. Which is a shame, I was looking forward to an intelligent conversation here on this board and I got attacked by a child.
Much hatzlacha in your future attempts at learning Ahavas Yisroel.
Moshiach Now!
(Which I am SURE will provide MUCH discussion and will ruffle your feathers even more)

Love,
Elli- tbob]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rav Moshe Feinstien would not give a Haskamah to that sefer as he said it was &quot;sheker aleph through tuf.&quot;

He absolutely did give &quot;a blanket heter to shave.&quot;. The sulchan uruch says explicitly &quot;scissors that cut like a razor are permitted.&quot; (Misparaim kain toar) I don’t understand your response.
He had a beard, he was also short, he was born in Europe, wouldn&#039;t say hey gavna instead of bameh madlikin (becuase violated a decree of chazal), wore blue shirts on occasion, only ate yoshun in yeshiva, didn&#039;t use a timer for anything other than lights, had a TV,  and  would only allow his children to drink cholov stam.  (and many other non-relevant things.)

Eastern European Rav&#039;s have beards- but buchrim were COMPELLED to shave. Forget about a heter. They weren&#039;t permitted to have a beard.

If having a beard fills some need of yours great- but don&#039;t pretend it is any kind of obligation.

He called the book sheker. He didn&#039;t say it wasn&#039;t his cup of tea.]]></description>

As for my confusing beards for observance, it&#039;s sad that you feel that way and that&#039;s your ONLY response to my post above. What kind of &#039;Rabbi&#039; knocks other Jews practices? Where is YOUR heter for shaving? Perhaps you asked YOUR Rav?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kind? Is that an attempt at an insult or just a show of your ignorance?
I do not &#039;spew&#039; misinformation, I quote Halachic authorities, which, I see, you don&#039;t hold by. How sad again. I am the father of wonderful children, many of which have their own children, and hopefully a great role model (if I do say so myself) to them and to the hundreds of people I have taught and mentored, and continue to do so.
So, I beg of you, do not be concerned for me, I am just fine. I don&#039;t hate, I am disappointed as I see this a the continuation of a downfall - but I do hope I am wrong about that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[re &quot;I am disturbed by the impact that a Public figure has&quot;
I have that concern about you, The Kind of Broadway spews misinformation about shaving and Jewish law.
I think a better role model is a man (beard or no beard) davens, goes to work, comes home to his wife and kids and does it again the next day.
Follow that advice and it wont matter what others do. Just be good yourself]]></description>
