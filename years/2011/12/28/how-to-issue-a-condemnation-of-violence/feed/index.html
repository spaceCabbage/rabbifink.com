		<description><![CDATA[&#062; I am not here to bash the Agudah (in this instance). It has nothing to do with THEM. I am simply providing what I feel to be an appropriate nusach for condemnation of this violence.

&#062; I am not consumed by any fires and I don&#039;t have righteous indignation. I see an injustice and I cannot stand by and not voice my displeasure.

&#062; As far as Daas Torah, I have my education, learning, teachers and mentors as well as experience and intelligence. I try to draw from all those sources when analyzing a problem and I hope that my perspective is acceptable within the framework of halacha and hashkafa. I hope that answers your question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Private condemnations don&#039;t do it for me. Where is the public outcry? Where are the Kol Koreh&#039;s that are obviously so easily accessible to our Rabbinic leaders? Saying that they are not representative of the chareidi community only holds water if the chareidi community condemns these acts and show that these people who seem to represent their community indeed do not. I promise you, these acts of violence and terrorism are worse for the minds of the average frum Jew than Nosson Slifkin&#039;s books. Where are the Kol Korehs? Where are the vaadin in yeshivos that were so effectively used to cast a shadow on Slifkin?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The difference is, the only concrete definition of a Scotsman is a man from Scotland.

Here, we have an actual definition of what a Charedi Jew is.  

This is an important distinction.  You assert that the traits of part of the Charedi world led to these abhorrent actions (I don&#039;t necessarily accept that).

However, I would hope that you acknowledge that assault and harassment are forbidden by halacha.  As such, it&#039;s not adherence to Judaism that is causing this.  However, that&#039;s what most of the media presents.  These &quot;Ultra-Orthodox Jews&quot; are assaulting young girls, in the name of Judaism.

That&#039;s why we must vocally assert that these men are not Charedi, nor are they any kind of observant Jew.  I wouldn&#039;t count one in a minyan, allow one to testify in beis din, or even eat in his home.

The Mormons have had to deal with this. A few groups splintered off from the LDS church started small cults where the leaders &quot;married&quot; dozens of underage girls.  Those cult leaders aren&#039;t Mormon.  These screamers and spitters aren&#039;t Charedi.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, its perfectly fair. You are simply advocating the &quot;No True Scottsman Fallacy.&quot;
These people are the monsters that charedi hashkafa (in all its grandeur ) has created. For years upon years, these communities have been living upon a fetish of sexualizing everything neutral around them—including those that DO dress modestly. This is simply the logical outcome of their maddening education. Hence, there is no surprise. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink wrote &quot;They have done so without fear of condemnation or retribution from the religiously adjacent charedi community.&quot;

Most heredim feel absolutely no affinity with the Sikrikim and do not consider themselves religiously adjacent to them any more than you do.

Where were the international media, the national religious Jews, the secular, Reform, Conservative, non-heredi orthodox Jews all these years the Sikrikim have been terrorizing the heredi in Meah Shearim?  Where were you?  You have been blogging since 2008, yet a search of &quot;Meah Shearim&quot; turns up no posts about the terror these hoodlums have been perpetrating there for years now.  Why only now do YOU feel the need to speak up?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If a goy put on a kipah and robbed a bank, would you issue that same condemnation, or would you say that this guy wasn&#039;t even Jewish, he just dressed the part?

These guys wear black hats and coats, big deal.  They&#039;re not frum.  Frum=following halacha.  Halacha forbids what they do.  It&#039;s more than they&#039;re not indicative of the average Charedi person.  They&#039;re just non-religious people who dress in a certain way.

Prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.  Let the world know that Jewish law prohibits their actions.  It&#039;s simply unfair to Charedim to lump these sick freaks in with them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is there a reason to condemn violence against women only? Violence against men is equally reprehensible, and much more likely to be physically abusive, like what happened to R&#039; Dov Lipman.

What bothers me about the condemnations that still mention tznius is that the girls school in question is a dati school and the dress code is according to Halacha. I would like to hear someone say, &quot;and while there are different standards for tzniut in different communities, as long as girls are dressing according to Halacha, nobody has the right to tell them to do anything else.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, because they are not like real chareidim, they will not care about being excommunicated or going to court. They listen only to their own rules and it will not stop their behavior. When people write that these &#039;spitters&#039; do not represent the other 99% it means to say that there is nothing the 99% can do to stop them. No Rabbi&#039;s ruling can stop their behavior, since they don&#039;t listen to the leading Rabbis.

Nevertheless, there have plenty of Rabbis who condemned these acts, put its not posted on Facebook or Youtube. Check the religious websites as well as charedi forums and you will see people&#039;s comments from a charedi perspective. The charedi publications in Israel published condemnations by many leaders. If you did not see them, it does not mean it did not happen. charedim don&#039;t use social media to get their message across]]></description>
