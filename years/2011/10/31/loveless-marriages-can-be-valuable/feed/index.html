		<description><![CDATA[I very much consider myself an insider within the orthodox Jewish community and it makes no sense to me. I am married and love/intimacy was high up on that choice and every family member and Rabbi I spoke to wanted to be very sure of that (when I met with my misader kidushin, the first thing he said was &quot;do you love her,&quot; followed by &quot;why&quot;). 

Two Points:
1) I am still unconvinced there is any difference between secular and Jewish definitions of marriage (obviously secular people are not interested in perpetuating Jewish values, but they have their own values and ideology). You state this difference as if it&#039;s fact but don&#039;t prove it. I have given you enough counter arguments for 1)the incredible and unmistakable stress that our tradition places on love/intimacy, and 2)the stress secular culture places on certain marriage values (family, tradition, faith, ideology, personal growth, self-sacrifice, etc.), but I have yet to hear any answers as to how Jews are any different from &quot;secular&quot; people. 

I do not think that &quot;within the orthodox Jewish definition of marriage&quot; the marriage in question makes any sense. I think our general homophobia (not as in we are afraid of homosexuals but in that we are afraid to address those issues outright in light of our religion) may overrule our concern for a healthy family structure and that&#039;s why some pretend this arrangement makes any sense, when in fact it seems to go against everything I think orthodox Jewish marriage to be about.

2) It&#039;s very easy to say you are not promoting anything or not picking sides, but your post doesn&#039;t suggest that. You must understand that referring to the couple in question as &quot;daring trailblazers&quot; certainly sounds like you have picked your side. That is not unbiased language. I&#039;m not going to point to all the times in your post when your position clearly comes though, as I have already done that, but it&#039;s not enough to just deny you were taking a stance after the fact. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is not promoting or celebrating anything. I don&#039;t have an opinion on which one is better. 
This post is a commentary on the kind of marriage that is promoted within orthodox Judaism, that is, love and intimacy are secondary to other concerns. To an outsider this seems insane, to an insider it is part of orthodox Judaism. The marriage described in the reddit post and Time Magazine article makes very little sense to an outsider. All I am saying is that within the orthodox Jewish definition of marriage it can make sense. That&#039;s all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is she going to refrain from all physical contact with this man when she is a niddah?  Is she going to follow all of the details of taharat hamishpacha, including going to the mikvah?  

If not, they&#039;re not allowed to touch.  They&#039;re not even allowed to pass items to each other.

If they&#039;re violating niddah, even through non-romantic touching, then the whole thing is a sham (as I suspect it to be).

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know why I can&#039;t reply to your post so I will do it here.

&quot;On the other hand, in orthodox Judaism, marriage is about much more than love and intimacy.&quot; The implication you are making is that marriage in the secular world is somehow lacking, they don&#039;t have that &quot;much more.&quot; Do you really think secular individuals would not be insulted to hear someone say their view of marriage does not include &quot;personal growth and healthy self-sacrifice?&quot; (This is all somewhat tangential though, as I am still unconvinced there is in fact any difference whatsoever between Jewish and secular perceptions of marriage.)

And the overarching argument of this piece is that &quot;loveless marriages can be valuable.&quot; But yet you are claiming not to weigh in as to which approach is superior,  the &quot;all you need is love&quot; or the love + values of marriage? Again, it is clear which you think is superior, you all but say it.
 
And you want to argue that you don&#039;t see it as a negative for people to divorce if they feel no love, but this article is promoting, even celebrating, staying in loveless relationships! You refer to those who choose a loveless marriage as &quot;daring trailblazers,&quot; but then say there is nothing wrong with divorce when there is no love. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And I disagree. While there are certain communities within Judaism that take a &quot;learn to love&quot; approach (which does place a pivotal importance on love and differs only in the order of when that love needs to come), I do not think that is representative of Judaism, or even orthodox Judaism. I think it is a minority that takes that approach as a necessary evil. I believe they too would say love is crucial in a relationship, but because of the potential dangers they see in interacting  with the opposite sex, they have chosen to take the route of arranged marriage, or marrying quickly after meeting. And there are plenty of other subsects of other religions who adopt similar approaches. I do not think there is any difference whatsoever is the general values/driving force of Jewish and secular marriage (that is to compare our ideal with &quot;their&quot; ideal). I think they too marry to start a family, pass on their ideology and faith, etc. To me this whole comparison sounds like extreme self-promotion based on no research and no fact and I am confident there are many in the &quot;secular&quot; world who would take extreme umbrage with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eitan, since I can&#039;t technically reply to your  comment below I will repeat what I said.

Yes, one can make the reverse arguments in both instances.

Also, I am using &quot;love&quot; in the romantic sense not the Biblical sense. So your sources are not very compelling. 
Also, Catholics are not &quot;secular&quot;. I would not be surprised if there were Catholics with similar stories.

		<description><![CDATA[And all I&#039;m saying is I don&#039;t see where you see these values &quot;clearly&quot; preferred in either circle. 

Yes I see a focus on love/intimacy in secular marriage, but its extremely present in the Jewish view of marriage as well. Why did Yaakov work so hard to get Rachel when he could have embodied all the values of Jewish marriage with Leah. The Torah tells us why. It was because he &quot;loved also Rachel more than Leah&quot; (Genesis 29:30).&quot;  &quot;And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her&quot; (Genesis 29:20).That choice of emotional love over pragmatism seems to fit more with your notion of secular marriage than Jewish. The idea of it seeming like only a few days sounds right out of a fairy tale, or chick flick (and that&#039;s not to demean the Torah, the reason ideas like that are so utilized in pop culture are because they are real).   Look at Shir Ha&#039;Shirim. &quot;Love is better than wine,&quot; &quot;I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in
Pharaoh&#039;s chariots,&quot; &quot;Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast
doves&#039; eyes.&quot; And that&#039;s just the first chapter! There is a reason  King Solomon depicts a relationship so full of love (this could be in a Shakespeare sonnet, lehavdil, and no one would think it out of place). It&#039;s because love is an inherent and necessary component for any successful relationship, whether it be between people or with God. There is a reason the highest level of serving God is through love, not fear. 

On the other hand, I see much focus on the importance of family and deeper values in a relationship in the secular culture as well. Sitcoms rarely portray couples without children. They often involve a woman married to a man far less attractive, seeming to point to something other than sex as the motivator/base for the relationship. There was a recent movie that came out called Higher Ground, which is focused on a devout Catholic family struggling with what it means to be people of faith and a family of faith, and how their relationships are informed by it. Yes, love and intimacy are displayed proudly as well, and they should be as they are, in both Jewish and secular societies, critical pieces of a successful relationship.   

It would seem to me that in both these societies there is an emphasis on both elements: love/intimacy, as well as communal , family and interpersonal values.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But you can&#039;t endorse this approach without at least acknowledging the need for these two to see people out of marriage. I think the biggest argument against this is the very fact that they need to seek love and intimacy out of marriage. It&#039;s not because they are crazy. It&#039;s because marriage without love and intimacy is crazy!

You say that &quot;A secular person who values love and sex over the other elements that 
are important to orthodox Jewish marriage cannot and will not understand
 their decision.&quot; This obviously implies that these two have in fact placed love and sex second in favor of &quot;those elements important to orthodox Jewish marriage.&quot; I would like to ask you to explain, what values of Orthodox Jewish marriage are these individuals demonstrating? Sleeping around, whether both parties are OK with it or not, is not something we generally associate with our values of marriage. And if you don&#039;t like that I keep coming back to that point, please explain to me what these two are accomplishing in terms of perpetuating Jewish marriage values that they otherwise could not. To use your own language, &quot;Marriage is about raising a family, being part of a community, creating 
an environment that promotes personal growth and healthy self-sacrifice.&quot; None of these seem to require a heterosexual relationship, and I think many would see an implication that they do as incredibly demeaning and discriminatory. (If you want to argue raising a family does, there are options such as in-vetro fertilization and adoption. Such a stance would also imply that a heterosexual couple that cannot have children are somehow lacking in their ability to embody the Jewish values of marriage.) Even if we accept your distinction between Orthodox Jewish marriage and secular marriage (I do not), I still don&#039;t understand what sexual orientation has to do with anything. 

You can&#039;t say this post is not about statistics when you base it on statistics without any confirmation of their validity. You write that &quot;In the end, many secular marriages end up being loveless and without intimacy.&quot; That is a statistic. It may be generalized and misused. But it&#039;s a statistic. 

And if you take away those statistics (or prove them wrong/misused) your argument is nothing but speculation. (And I&#039;m not sure about your background, but I know for myself, my interactions with non-Jewish couples are far too limited to weight in on the differences or comparisons between theirs and ours.) I would love to see your sources or how you arrived at the conclusion that Jews choose to focus on these values of marriage over love/intimacy, whereas secular people choose the opposite. And even if you are correct in that first assertion, I don&#039;t understand how you made the connection that this focus on love/intimacy is exactly what causes failed marriages. Again, an argument as out-of-the-box as love leads to divorce is going to need some support.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The last sentence of this post just gives away the game! &quot;just because someone is gay or cheating on their spouse does not mean 
they can&#039;t be orthodox Jews in every other possible manner.&quot; So what is gained by forcing this type of marriage upon people?What are we trying to &quot;fix&quot; if we understand that people can be actively gay/lesbian and still be considered Orthodox?

As far as your notion that cheating only be cheating &quot; if one person is hiding from the other:&quot; 

First, that might not be called cheating but it certainly doesn&#039;t point to a healthy relationship (it&#039;s definitely not the standard Jewish view of marriage, to use your own argument and standards you set above). Would we tolerate a heterosexual couple who had this sort of open sexual relationship outside of marriage? Would that couple be accepted in our Orthodox Jewish Communities? I find that hard to believe. So why should we be so accepting of it here? Are we settling because, &quot;at least they are in a heterosexual marriage?&quot; I just don&#039;t see the point. Do we view sex with multiple partners out of marriage as less offensive than a loving relationship between two people of the same sex? Are we really prepared to publicize a view like that?

And second, in the eyes of the Torah its inconsequential whether the spouse knows and is OK with it or not. In that respect it is actually more of a problem for the woman. 

Let&#039;s look at what this arrangement has accomplished.

Before:
Man - actively gay (problem M&#039;idiorita, from the Torah)
Woman - actively lesbian (problem M&#039;dirabanan, from the Rabbis)

After:
Man - actively gay (problem M&#039;idiorita)
         - sex outside of marriage (problem post rabbinical ruling not to have multiple wives)
Woman - actively lesbian (problem M&#039;dirabanan)
               - sex outside of marriage (problem M&#039;idiorita)

So in addition to this relationship being, I think, emotionally dangerous and hurtful, it ensures that each party will violate at least one Torah commandment, were as before that was not necessarily true. (It may be that the woman having lesbian sex wouldn&#039;t be considered cheating according to the Torah because it&#039;s not considered sex according to the Torah, but at the very least, she has now racked up two rabbinical violations where before she only had one.) We should at least be honest with ourselves, the only reason we push these kind of arrangements is to further brush the issue under the rug because we - as Orthodox Jews who want to be fair, tolerant and caring but also want to encourage the full acceptance of Torah commandments - don&#039;t know how to handle this issue. But we do no one any favors by pretending that solutions such as these are working. We need to stop hiding from the issue or trying to fix it, but addressing the seeming contradiction openly. As this couple demonstrates, you can hide our gay/lesbian community behind fronts of marriage, but it doesn&#039;t make the issue go away.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The last sentence of this post just gives away the game! &quot;just because someone is gay or cheating on their spouse does not mean 
they can&#039;t be orthodox Jews in every other possible manner.&quot; So what is gained by forcing this type of marriage upon people?What are we trying to &quot;fix&quot; if we understand that people can be actively gay/lesbian and still be considered Orthodox?

As far as your notion that cheating only be cheating &quot; if one person is hiding from the other:&quot; 

First, that might not be called cheating but it certainly doesn&#039;t point to a healthy relationship (it&#039;s definitely not the standard Jewish view of marriage, to use your own argument and standards you set above). Would we tolerate a heterosexual couple who had this sort of open sexual relationship outside of marriage? Would that couple be accepted in our Orthodox Jewish Communities? I find that hard to believe. So why should we be so accepting of it here? Are we settling because, &quot;at least they are in a heterosexual marriage?&quot; I just don&#039;t see the point. Do we view sex with multiple partners out of marriage as less offensive than a loving relationship between two people of the same sex? Are we really prepared to publicize a view like that?

And second, in the eyes of the Torah its inconsequential whether the spouse knows and is OK with it or not. In that respect it is actually more of a problem for the woman. 

Let&#039;s look at what this arrangement has accomplished.

Before:
Man - actively gay (problem M&#039;idiorita, from the Torah)
Woman - actively lesbian (problem M&#039;dirabanan, from the Rabbis)

After:
Man - actively gay (problem M&#039;idiorita)
         - sex outside of marriage (problem post rabbinical ruling not to have multiple wives)
Woman - actively lesbian (problem M&#039;dirabanan)
               - sex outside of marriage (problem M&#039;idiorita)

So in addition to this relationship being, I think, emotionally dangerous and hurtful, it ensures that each party will violate at least one Torah commandment, were as before that was not necessarily true. (It may be that the woman having lesbian sex wouldn&#039;t be considered cheating according to the Torah because it&#039;s not considered sex according to the Torah, but at the very least, she has now racked up two rabbinical violations where before she only had one.)

I just want to clarify something

I don&#039;t mean to say that all secular marriages are like X and all orthodox Jewish marriages are Y. I mean to say that there are values that are clearly preferred and promoted within each of those two societies that are very different when it comes to marriage. 
Popular culture (books, TV, movies etc) has a very strong message about love and intimacy as primary considerations for marriage while orthodox Jewish society does not. That&#039;s all I am saying. I am not saying that one is better. I am saying that this couple&#039;s decision shows me that they believe that in their community marriage does not need to be about love and intimacy. I think that is a valuable message.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One point I think everyone is missing. Their marriages may not necessarily be loveless. This is specifically the negative pattern that the world at large is often stuck in. They allow this all-encompassing self-definition of &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;lesbian&quot;  to mean incapable of loving or being attracted to the opposite sex- when in fact there are many shades of gray. These individuals may well be capable of loving each other- even if their sexual attraction to each other may be minimal or non-existent.  
I read an article in the Los Angeles Times a few years back of a a famous gay author who described his unusual marriage to the &quot;love of his life&quot;, who just happened to be a lesbian woman.

		<description><![CDATA[

I have to disagree with your split between secular and
Jewish marriages. The idea that secular people (using your term and assuming it
means everyone who is not Jewish) marry only for love and intimacy, while the
Jewish desire to marry &quot;is about raising a family, being part of a
community, creating an environment that promotes personal growth and healthy
self-sacrifice&quot; is an extreme generalization and I&#039;m not sure what
information it&#039;s based on. This lofty self view is probably fairly insulting to
secular individuals who (we must concede it’s at least possible if not
plausible) want very similar things from marriage. If I had to guess, for both
secular and Jewish people it’s a fairly even mix of both these elements. Are we
really prepared to say that secular people have no desire to create a
relationship that “promotes personal growth and healthy self-sacrifice?&quot;
Furthermore, I invite you to find one credible mental health/relationship
professional, in the Jewish or non-Jewish world, who would confirm that “love
and intimacy” are “of the least important aspects to a marriage.” 


As for your argument of divorce, you do not confirm that the
focus on love leads to divorce (seems pretty extreme to me - love causes
divorce - definitely something you would need to prove). This is a classic
misuse of statistics. If two things are true, it does not mean they are in any
way related. You must be able to prove causation. You write about “the spark”
being gone. But I would argue that if it was only a spark it probably wasn’t
true love and that was the real problem, not the focus on “love and intimacy.” 


And to come back to the problem of causation, so often Jews
are lauded for having stronger marriages because of their lower rates of
divorce. Assuming that’s true (it’s not), there is probably a 3rd variable.
The small communities and taboo view of divorce in many Jewish circles make it
an extremely uncomfortable option for many, whereas in the secular world it is
becoming more and more acceptable.     


Now onto the truth. Jews actually boast an alarming 30%
divorce rate (2009). While this may be below the national rate, it is higher
than Christians and even Atheists/Agnostics. http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_dira.htm


What would happen if these ”daring trailblazers” didn’t have
the opportunity to pursue love and intimacy out of their marriage? Isn’t the
fact that they are unable or unwilling to continue in their marriage founded on
these lofty goals without finding some love and intimacy elsewhere the
strongest proof for the necessity of those elements? Marriage without love is a
dangerous thing. This couple is a perfect example of that. You write of love
and intimacy coming second to things like growth and healthy self-sacrifice,
but this relationship has neither. They are actively pursuing relationships
outside of their marriage. What self-sacrifice sacrifice is there in that? What
commitment? They live under one room and share financial costs? Such marriages
are fronts, an understandable means of avoiding rebuke while enabling them to
pursue their true desires. I see no benefit to such things.

your use of the tone commentors on Reddit seem to have, shouldnt be used to paint a picture of what the general population thinks and feels about marriage. I dont know how familiar you are with Reddit, and I dont want to get too descriptive. Hang arounf there for a week and you;ll see what I mean. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The objections to this arrangement in the comments on reddit carry a strong overtone of what I am describing as the secular marriage. They focus on the love and intimacy (or lack thereof) in this marriage and then cast it aside.

Your second point MAKES my point. I am not speaking of the historical secular marriage. I am speaking of contemporary secular marriage which as you say places a heretofore minor aspect of love and intimacy at the fore.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re making too big a generalization about marriages in the non-Jewish world vs. the Jewish world. Despite the ideal presented in fiction, a huge number of people in the non-Jewish world marry for financial security, having children, etc. There&#039;s no monolithic view of marriage.

And before the last couple of hundred years, marriage was rarely about love. In the ancient world, marriage wasn&#039;t even for companionship. Emotional intimacy, was between men &#038; other men, usually nonsexually.. Women were for procreation and raising the children. That&#039;s why polygamy wasn&#039;t such a big deal.

But still, in most cases today, we DO expect emotional intimacy in marriage. And children raised in that sort of household tend to far better.So while I respect a couple&#039;s right to decide to marry for such practical reasons, the only reasons people really do so in the example you bring up is because of fear and intimidation from the frum community. They end up living in the closet, and I can&#039;t imagine that most of these people are anything but unhappy.My advice for gay people who wish to maintain a halachic lifestyle is to find an Observant Conservative community, or LWMO one, and find a same-sex partner there. Living a lie because of the Orthodox community&#039;s homophobia benefits no one, not gay people and not the frum community.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it shows anything good. It&#039;s a default position that must be taken to fit into frum communities, end of story. As much as I&#039;ve seen, in the video and this letter, the people doing it don&#039;t value marriage as something they must do for the greater good. They do it because that&#039;s the only way their families and/or communities will ever accept them. 
As a single frum guy, I know exactly what the stigma is. ]]></description>
