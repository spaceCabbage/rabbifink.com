		<description><![CDATA[&#062; I believe that R’ Schwab meant something slightly different. He meant that the focus of studying history for frum Jews is not for historical accuracy. It is for inspiration. It is not a science. It is literature. Meanwhile he clearly acknowledges that the charedi view of the past is skewed. But he says that’s okay as long as one realizes the difference between inspirational myth and history.
 
I don’t see that in the quote at all. I see someone who is saying that history has no value in itself, and that the only reason to learn history at all is to draw inspiration from lionized historical figures. In point of fact, hagiographies and revisionist history (created by people with this view of history) is not taught as inspiring myths, but as what actually happened. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Yes I gathered that the book was pieced together. It was still slightly irritating.

&#062; Knowing everything else I know about R&#039; Schwab it is clear to me that he was saying it the way I understood him.

&#062; RSFM was different than RAK. He established day schools and high schools and post high school programs. RAK was actually trying to create roshei yeshiva. RSFM was not.

&#062; Your acquaintance is partially correct. RYW was not a pure rationalist. But his students today are still debating many of the things he said. He was &quot;classically rationalist in many respects&quot; that is certain. I have first hand information about that. But no one that knew the man would disagree that he was a moderate.

&#062; R&#039; Aaron Feldman is far more charedi than RYW ever was.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice review Rabbi Fink. 

Regarding your critiques, the first issue you raise I think is a result of many of the chapters previously having been independent  artciles and only later brought together to form this book. Much of the beginnings and endings of each chapter in which he tells you what you&#039;ve read and what you will read was YF&#039;s attempt at a segue. 

In your interpretation of the R Shwab quote, you&#039;ve really only spelled out what was written by him in dumbed down language. I don&#039;t think whether you see that he acknowledge that history is skewed really makes a difference; either way he is in support Haredi Fan Fiction. 

I find the quote from Artscroll, about R Shraga F. M. interesting, in that R Aron Kotler is really the individual credited with introducing the concept of torah study for its own sake, or in other words, to create &quot;soldiers&quot; and not &quot;generals.&quot; Wonder how that dispute will end in a world where everything can be true.......

Regarding R YW, I don&#039;t really know anything about him, although being the RY of NIRC (in the past) is certainly a sign that he wasn&#039;t mainstream Haredi. However, an acquaintance of mine once said that RYW was in fact not a rationalist and used one of his sons as a benchmark. I don&#039;t know who his children are. 

I think today&#039;s R Aron Feldman (whose brother Emmanuel wrote one of my favorite books as a kid, &#039;The Shul Without A Clock&#039;) gives of the aura of not being Haredi, but the snippets I read from his book &#039;Eye of the Storm&#039; seem to indicate otherwise.
