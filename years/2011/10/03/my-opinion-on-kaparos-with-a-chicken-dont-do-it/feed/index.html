		<description><![CDATA[Mike S.

The real problem is strengthening the view that one can &quot;force&quot; God to do what one wants by something that has nothing to do with improving midot, learning and/or mitzvah observance.  Judaism is about serving God, not getting God to serve you.  The prayer says &quot;Tshuvah u&#039;tefillah, utzedakah.&quot;  It doesn&#039;t mention waving the tzedakah around your head before giving it, much less chickens.  A strict view of the Rambam&#039;s 11th ikkar (reward and punishment) would seem to exclude believing in the effectiveness of any segulah that is not per se a mitzvah; while giving to tzedakah (whether cash or chicken) is a mitzvah, waving it around your head isn&#039;t.]]></description>

This is where we disagree.  I think this is because you are basing your understanding of the AS on an assumption that he is speaking about using a chicken you were going to use to eat.  This is not evident from the AS&#039;s words.  I pointed this out in an above post.  But even if you were correct, the concern of avodah zarah is an issue of using a white chicken, not seeking out of a chicken.  If one were to seek out a brown chicken it seems from the AS that it would be ok.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again, you are not understanding the point. I hope it is not willful. It has nothing to do with caring about what the chicken looks like. Please try again.

Buying a specific type of live chicken in 1870 is analogous to buying a specifically live chicken in 2011.

This is because both are examples of people &quot;going out of their way&quot; for a specific chicken which would not have &quot;come to their hand&quot; naturally.

In 1870 if you would go into your backyard to get a chicken for dinner whether it is white or brown it is not &quot;seeking out&quot; a chicken that would not have &quot;come to your hand&quot; naturally because that is what you did every time you wanted to eat chicken.

My point is that I believe the Aruch HaShulchan held that if you do nothing extraordinary and you happen to do kaparos along the way to preparing your meal THAT is okay. But if you do anything that implies that you are &quot;seeking out&quot; a specific course of events that artificially creates a kaparos with a chicken opportunity it would be problematic.

Clearer?]]></description>

Perhaps you have interpreted certain items as anti-charedi. Gezunteheit...

Maybe you don&#039;t understand the post, but when I propose 10 reasons for something and you attack one by saying it &quot;might not be tzaar baalei chayim&quot;, and then say I am making an issue out of one small incident, and I defend my position by saying that the 1 issue is not the only issue, I fail to see how I am not engaging in debate...]]></description>

Good point, thanks for clarifying.  Would you say the same thing with respect to modern religious events that are generally more inclusive (for women) such as simchat bat, women&#039;s tefila groups, etc?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I meant was, when great rabbis ban a RELIGIOUS practice (the opposite of how things normally proceed) and hamon am persists it makes me suspicious of the practice.

It reminds me of the famous Gaon on Shir HaShirim: &lt;i&gt; If you are running to do a mitzvah, double check to make sure it is really a mitzvah.&lt;/i&gt;

People can certainly chart their own experiences religiously. But they should violate the core tenets of their religion while doing so as may be the case with kaparos.

Finally, you have misstated the Rambam&#039;s view on TSBP. His view is that one should study the sources and make personal informed decisions. That is exactly what I am trying to help people do here.

Thank you for your thoughtful comments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Re the diyuk:
The Aruch Hashulchan says: &quot;Im ira lo...&quot; if one happens to have a white chicken you can use it.The inference is that one should not seek after a specific type of chicken.

The assumption is that one needs to buy a chicken for their pre-Yom Kippur meal. The way things worked in 19th century Russia was that you bought a live chicken in the market, had it shechted, kashered it in your home and cooked it. Everyone was buying a live chicken for their pre-Yom Kippur meal.

It was considered okay to use the chicken you bought for kaparos. But it was not considered okay to go out of one&#039;s way for a particular chicken.

Today, we buy chicken in the market too. But it is dead, kashered and cleaned already. Going to a kaparos ceremony is by definition &quot;going out of one&#039;s way&quot; for a specific chicken.

I think this would be frowned upon by R&#039; Epstein.]]></description>

The way things worked in 19th century Russia was that you bought a live chicken in the market, had it shechted, kashered it in your home and cooked it. Everyone was buying a live chicken for their pre-Yom Kippur meal.</p>
<p>It was considered okay to use the chicken you bought for kaparos. But it was not considered okay to go out of one&#8217;s way for a particular chicken.</p>
<p>Today, we buy chicken in the market too. But it is dead, kashered and cleaned already. Going to a kaparos ceremony is by definition &#8220;going out of one&#8217;s way&#8221; for a specific chicken.</p>
<p>I think this would be frowned upon by R&#8217; Epstein.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand that, but that does not mean they were taking chickens form their own yard.  And even if they were, so what! That does not mean that is why it was used for kaparos, that is incidental.  Those who did not have chickens, may very well have purchased one or found someone selling them for kaparos.  EF&#039;s reasoning is that they were using it anyway.  That is not provable from the Aruch Hashulchan and in fact it seems opposite to his diyuk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[CTS, you may have a point in the first paragraph of your comment. I don&#039;t know enough about what the Aruch HaShulchan says to say who&#039;s right.

But as to your second point, that people didn&#039;t do the actual shchita themselves, so what? I don&#039;t think REF was assuming that they did. The point is that the chickens were from their own yards. The fact that they took the chickens over to the shochet for the actual slaughtering is besides the point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your diyuk is quite weak.  Nowhere does the Aruch Hashulchan refer to a chicken you are shechting anyway.  He says &quot;use the chicken you use for kaporos for your erev yomtov meal.  Fist you do kaparos and then use it.  The second part of  your diyuk is flawed as well.  You cannot search for a white chicken this is avodah zarah.  The problem with doing it with a white chicken only is that using a white chicken specifically because it is white is the avodah zarah.  Use whatever chickens you have on hand is to say that there is no ban on white chickens, rather use whatever there is whether it be white brown or any other color.  

Secondly, it is not fair to say that people were shechting chickens anyway.  Back in Europe was no different than today.  People were not fluent in schitah and could not do it on their own the same as we can&#039;t.  You needed to be trained and the common folk were not.  There was a town butcher that was used.  So it isn&#039;t fair to say everyone was shechting chickens for their meal.

You may want to do mnore research on tzar balei chayim before &quot;paskening&quot; that it is surely such.]]></description>
