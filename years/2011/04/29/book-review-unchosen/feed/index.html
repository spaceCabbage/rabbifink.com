		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure the flaws are in Orthodox Judaism per se. I think perhaps the flaws are in religion in general ... when compared to secularism. It isn&#039;t OJ alone that is losing members, many other religions are losing members (certainly &quot;serious&quot; members ... like OJ) just as fast or faster. The lure of secularism is quite strong and is a relatively recent phenomenon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting that the author lumps in Breslov with the other Hasidic groups, and contrasts them all with Lubavitch.

Breslov also does large amounts of outreach work.  I would even say that they have been more successful in outreach in Israel than Lubavitch.  As a result, self-identified Breslov Hasidim can be found in many professional fields all over the Jewish world, as can self-identified Lubavitch Hasidim.

Whereas other Hasidic groups typically do not have official websites, there are several websites that are sanctioned by both Lubavitch and Breslov.

I would also be curious to know why Rabbi Fink seems to be fascinated with observant Jews who leave observance.  I hope this fascination stems from concern, and not envy.]]></description>

I would recommend the film, Divan (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303917/) which in addition to the main story, deals with the filmmaker&#039;s and her friend&#039;s departure from Orthodox Judaism. ]]></description>
