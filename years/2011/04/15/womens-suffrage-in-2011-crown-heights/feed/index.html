		<description><![CDATA[Well, I think the Feds shouldn&#039;t be giving money to religious institutions in a religious capacity. The Feds COULD require that women be treated equally in a shul IN ORDER TO GET FEDERAL FUNDING. That&#039;s not a slippery slope at all. It&#039;s a clear rule. You want our money, follow our rules.

I believe, Federal money should go to organizations or services that perform functions normally performed by a government. So social services, charities etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[feds shouldnt give money to anyone, but thats a different discussion.

the truth is once the feds get involved and invade religious institutions where do u draw the line?  whats next, the fed requires that women be ordained as rabbis? that they get alliyahs? be shaliach tzibur? speak from the pulpit? 

slippery slope argument.

i know you dont like slippery slope arguments, but i think in the gender/equality context we have seen that the line becomes so blurred that the slippery slope has come to pass....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An analogous case has not yet been decided in the SCOTUS. So it&#039;s
technically a grey area. Although I agree, as I wrote, that it would
never win. The issue would be framed as the article in the NYT puts
it, as whether federal funds can be granted to an organization with
discriminatory policies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[there is absolutely NO way the challengers would prevail under a 14 amendment complaint.  accepting federal funds (as im sure you know and if u dont know yet, chemerinsky&#039;s con law bar review for Barbri will fill you in) isnt nearly enough for the feds to get involved in religious institutions like this....]]></description>
