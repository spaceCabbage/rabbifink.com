		<description><![CDATA[The logic of the argument does not make sense.  Violating a terms of agreement is not fraud it is breach of contract.  Fraud is the intent to deceive.  Not complying with his terms of agreement is not fraud.  I did not read the opinion, but I am curious to know how it was argued as fraud and how the appeals court was able to say hiring of workers is fraud and not breach of his agreement and therefore the evidence of hiring practice should be admitted.  As for intent, intent would be required for something to be fraud, if something is done unintentionally how can the argument be made that it was fraud (intent to mislead the bank).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you read the opinions you would realize that what you are saying here is false. So I dontl trust you. 
1) The fraud occurred well in advance of the raid. Using the raid as a smokescreen to justify the fraud is a lie. 
2) Hiring (not highering) undocumented workers WAS a violation of the bank loan agreement which required Agri be in compliant with the law as part of the TERMS OF THE LOAN. 
3) Intent is not required to be guilty of hiring undocumented workers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read the opinions. Trust me. But instead of following the reasoning of the Iowa attorneys (about whom Nat Lewin claims he never encountered such unlawful prosecutors in his 50 year career), I am melamed zchus, and realize that there it is ludicrous to think that RUbashkin actually expected a huge raid and his plant to go bust and default on the loan, and highering illegal aliens (which the court never really proved was intentional) has nothing at all to do with a bank loan!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He was offered 12 years. The bottom line is Rubashkin was guilty and knew it. He also knew that potential sentence he was facing and was offered a shorter sentence. He took a gamble and lost. The fact that he was an uncooperative and unremorseful defendant did not help him at sentencing. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, the Feds offered him no less than 15 years! 

By the way, you happen to have a very poor understanding of the case, so I suggest you stop blogging now, you really  cannot see past the technical language of the ruling.

You missed out many, many points. One example, the reason why the Feds say its 27 mil fraud is firstly because Rubashkin signed on his loan agreement that the plant is completely legal, and there were illegal aliens, that&#039;s it! If you think about it for a second, you will realize how outrageous that is, because he signed that the plant is legal, therefore the whole loan is fraudulent!?!

whatever, continue living in your own world - jumping on the bandwagon with the anti-semitic Iowans]]></description>
