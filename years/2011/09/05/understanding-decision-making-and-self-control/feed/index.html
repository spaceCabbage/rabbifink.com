		<description><![CDATA[What is all this nonsense? Frum Jews observe the Torah because their souls were out Mt Sinai. They understand the world better then anyone else. They don&#039;t decide to keep shabbos, they just do it, because they are a holy people.

No need for psychology mumbo jumbo, just open a Misilas Yesharim, and you&#039;ll find all the truths about people.
