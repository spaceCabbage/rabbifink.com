		<description><![CDATA[Oh no no! My kids wear uniforms to school and on the last Friday of every month they have a &quot;free dress day&quot;. 

We have NEVER ONCE been to school on time for a free dress day. Uniforms are the best things that could happen for schools. Don&#039;t even think about taking them away. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree.  When I was in high school back circa 1968-71, our school essentially has no dress code.  That didn&#039;t stop us from high academic achievement.   I tended to favor wearing dress shirts with blue jeans and a cool pair of motorcycle boots.  I tucked the jeans into my books, a very intimidating appearance that was of great value for the subway ride through the ghetto to school.  One day, my father was late for work and ended up meeting me at the bust stop in the morning.  He saw my outfit and had a fit.  But what the hell could he do, if I went in to change, I&#039;d be late for school. So he got over it, just like he got over my long hair, sideburns and mustache.

Incidentally, he was a surgeon, and he would put on a nice suit and tie every morning, but as soon as he got the the hospital, the suit, tie, and dress shirt went into a locker, and he spent the day in a scrub suit and white coat.  But he maintained that he had to dress like that.  I thought it was stupid, but I have personally experienced how people treat me differently depending on how I&#039;m dressed.  I still think it&#039;s stupid, but if I need to wear a suit and tie, I&#039;ll do it without complaint.   Fortunately, the shul where I pray doesn&#039;t require one.

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps. (though I don&#039;t see anything I said as being so illogical)

OR,

I can accuse you as well of buying the kool aid that kids are so fragile and weak that their confidence is diminished by tough policy. 

Please...

My mother in Russia had to wear uniforms in her school and was just fine.

My younger sister is in a charter school that has a strict policy and she is just fine. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Downplaying the individuality of each girl can harm girls’ confidence
I think some accessorizing would be nice, but I really don&#039;t think a lack, affects confidence. I think individuality doesn&#039;t reside in clothing alone, but in the personality. That is something that fellow classmates and teachers pick up on and ends up blossoming. One of the lessons I do like about uniforms is that it teaches the students that there is a time and place for everything. I wear such and such to the beach. I wear such and such to work. And I wear such and such to school. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; Fink,
I could not agree with you more, but I think your point applies not just to school uniforms, but to frum school&#039;s obssession with rules in general.  Frum schools need to relax their rules, and focus on instilling a love of Torah observance, not conformance to silly rules, like the dress code.  Rav Moshe Weinberger has been very outspoken lately about this issue.  I sometimes wonder if the reason schools focus on stupid rules and not a love of Torah observance is because these teachers themselves personally lacking in the latter area.  It also could  be because enforcing rules is much easier than instilling passion in children, so they take the easy way out.  Or maybe they are just a bunch of control freaks.  In the case of our esteemed high school principal, I think he just likes getting up and bashing things, everything and anything.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Parents and pupils are known to complain about the limited options for what to wear to school. &lt;/i&gt;

Are you kidding? No parent complains about uniforms. It is the best invention ever. No wasting time deciding what to wear in the morning, no close in size sisters fighting over clothes, no &quot;must have or I&#039;ll die&quot; shorts/pants/skirts/etc. Just put on your uniform and that&#039;s it. Done and on the way to school.]]></description>
