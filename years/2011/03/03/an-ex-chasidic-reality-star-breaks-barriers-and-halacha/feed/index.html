		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m &quot;modern&quot; Orthodox and I don&#039;t watch reality TV shows.  I&#039;d find stuff like that too depressing.

Susan, if the guy didn&#039;t do it at producers&#039; behest, he would have eaten treif with his new friends at a bar or someplace else.  The big sadness is that he went OTD to begin with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Watching that show is a bad habit of mine. I have to say, it made my stomach turn, too, when they encouraged him to eat treyf and then went on to praise him for it. I really wish he had told them, &quot;No, sorry, I&#039;ll cook it if I have to in order to stay in the competition, but I&#039;m not going to eat it.&quot;

There is nothing commendable in talking someone out of following his/her religious beliefs. Even though this guy had already gone OTD, there is nothing worthy in leading him further away from his roots. I also thought it was disrespectful of the show&#039;s hosts/producers to do so.]]></description>
