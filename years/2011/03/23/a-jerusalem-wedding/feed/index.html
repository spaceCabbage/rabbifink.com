		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Why then do you dismiss the request for textual citations, or at the very least source info for opinions being presented as facts.

Because for one thing, you aren&#039;t asking  for textual citations—at least not for the comment I was replying to. You are asking for names of people he may have had conversations with 10 years ago. Or names of paintings. Who keeps that sort of citation?

The fact is, I would not defend R&#039; Fink unless I felt he had a point. For example...I did not defend R&#039; Fink on his post concerning Reform Judaism. I didn&#039;t even need sources for that. Yet here, through experience of several weddings, I strongly feel is is correct. Judaism does indeed borrow minhagim from their surrounding cultures. 

I&#039;m not even arguing YOUR sources. They may be totally correct. My point is, I don&#039;t think they are relevant because nobody that sits down today in weddings, in my opinion, is doing it because the Sifrei said so. I have myself seen images of old europe where the people stand around, and now....we sit. 

The fact of the matter is, you do observe patterns in this world and one of them, is that I see orthodox weddings in LA that have everyone sitting with the aisle down the center. No different than the non-jewish ones. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) YOU ARE ARGUING WITH AN IMAGINARY BOOGIE MAN. I NEVER SAID THAT THE CUSTOM WAS TO STAND WHEN THE KALLAH WALKS DOWN. &lt;i&gt;YOU&lt;/i&gt; INVENTED THAT STATEMENT! I SAID THAT THE CUSTOM IS TO STAND &lt;i&gt;DURING&lt;/i&gt; THE CHUPA. AND IT IS.

APPARENTLY THIS IS BASED ON SOURCES THAT REQUIRE STANDING FOR VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE CHUPA AND FOR CONVENIENCE THE CUSTOM BECAME TO STAND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE THING.

2) DON&#039;T BE SO DISGUSTED. MANY OF OUR CUSTOMS HAVE BEEN, CONTINUE TO BE AND WILL BE IN THE FUTURE BORROWED FROM OTHERS. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. STOP FEIGNING DISGUST OR ALTERNATIVELY, STOP BEING DISGUSTED WITH NORMAL BEHAVIOR.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How could you be so intellectually dishonest? Even when you are proven to be fabricating the discussion that is readable on this very page...

I quote what I wrote in the beginning of this thread:

&quot;With all due respect (although from Rabbi Fink&#039;s response he does not seem to be aware), there is no &quot;Jewish&quot; and certainly not any &quot;halachic&quot; basis to stand while the kallah walks down the aisle.

The fact that they didn&#039;t have the resources in the poverty stricken shtetels to seat a mass of people outside, is obviously not a proof as to halacha.

Rabbi Fink, what does your Rebbi do- does he sit or stand by the chuppah? Do you think he is basing his behavious on a &quot;Christian&quot; custom? Or do you think he is somone who acts in accordance to halacha and mesorah?

And that those who stand, are the ones who are unaware or unfamiliar with the relevant Jewish law and customs? &quot;

Clearly this discussion was based on two statements that I made, and which you have done nothing to counter:

1) There is no &quot;Jewish&quot; and certainly not any &quot;halachic&quot; basis to stand while the kallah walks down the aisle.

2) Disgust by the fact that you claim that all the Roshei Hayeshiva and Gedolei Torah who sit by chuppahs are doing so due to &quot;western&quot; and &quot;christian&quot; influence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t understand you. Really.

The challenge you raised was that there is no authentic source for standing during the chupa. I said that I believed the Yerushalmi custom to stand was older and when another commenter said the American custom to sit was borrowed I agreed based on what I had heard. You demanded a source that said it was proper to stand. This has been provided. We are through!

Now you want to debate whether the source should be listened to and exactly what it refers to and if it&#039;s different that other dvarim she&#039;bkdusha and who said anything about standing while the kallah was walking down and how is it relevant as to whether I PERSONALLY follow halachos based on kabbala? What is this? Seriously?

HH was absolutely right.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink:

&quot;I don&#039;t expect any retractions or apologies from you. It&#039;s enough for me that your credibility comes into serious question.&quot;

Oy vey. Why do you have to spew your reckless and misplaced insults?

Now hopefully we could discuss this in a civil and grown-up way without the silly one-liners.

Now that you have produced something of SUBSTANCE, lets discuss it:

Assuming you are citing the sources that Ashkenazi Jewery paskins like (universally), the basis to stand is as cited above the פרקי דרבי אליעזר סוף פט&quot;ז if you look at the source inside the basis to stand is only for the reason of &quot;chassan dome l&#039;melech&quot; which only applies to the chassan not the kallah. Furthermore, it would appear that the &quot;chassan&quot; is only &quot;domeh l&#039;melech&quot; once the kiddushin is chal. At best, one could say that they are standing for the chassan as respect to the fact that he is on the way to do a mitzva. 

However, as mentioned above, I am unaware of any source whatsoever to stand as the kallah as walking down.

The sources you were given to quote from generally are based on citation that one should stand for a bracha that is said by a minyan, a &quot;davar sh&#039;bekedushah&quot; which is the same as anytime a bracha is said with a minyan present (the halacha always defines it a &quot;inyan chasidus&quot; to stand), however I wonder if you or anyone you know is makpid on that. In addition, no where did the sources that you friend gave you imply or quote a source as to standing for the period other than when the brachos are being recited (for the reasons mentioned above, which it would seem you and the majority of the world is not accustomed to follow).

The only other &quot;standing&quot; rational I could assume from the sources that were given to you to post, is if you paskin according to the kabalistic and sefardic sources cited. Do you? The Ashkanazi world in America and abroad doesn&#039;t seem to...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You seem to be an intelligent fellow. Why then do you dismiss the request for textual citations, or at the very least source info for opinions being presented as facts.

I get the feeling that you are not one to settle for a weak &quot;because that&#039;s the way it is&quot; type of response.

So why do you think Rabbi Fink should be held at a lower standard?

True, this is not &quot;life or death&quot; issues- but many individuals (secular or religious) would be ashamed to write &quot;fact-based&quot; articles, without being able to supply a shred of supporting sources.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;When textual and logical proofs are brought that strongly undercut Rabbi Finks&#039;s position, instead of offering an intelligent position defending him- you attack his opponents with baseless personal insults.

But I believe that is the point. Yes, you brought up some sources. But first, those don&#039;t necessarily negate anything R&#039; Fink said. And second, your very specific prodding at him giving over names of rabbis that told him stories, and then asking what stories exactly....etc etc etc, these aren&#039;t realistic questions. A person simply does not store &quot;sources&quot; like that for another day. I mean, this isn&#039;t really life or death topic. I mean seriously, after he names the paintings, will you ask for who painted them? And then where they are kept? And what type of frame is holding them?  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;See that&#039;s how it works with those kinds of folks.&quot;

I see your back to your conspiracy theories.

I thought you had stopped with the silly insults and childish words. 

You sort of have a trend.

When textual and logical proofs are brought that strongly undercut Rabbi Finks&#039;s position, instead of offering an intelligent position defending him- you attack his opponents with baseless personal insults.

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi--
I&#039;ve scanned the comments, and I had to weigh in as well.  
I&#039;m not really sure if the person who told you that the wedding you attended &quot; was absolutely typical of Jerusalem orthodox weddings &quot; was reliable.  
I just made a wedding in J&#039;lem 5 months ago.  It certainly was different from many American weddings I&#039;ve attended.  But not in the way you describe.  Indeed--  I was also told it was &quot; absolutely typical of Jerusalem orthodox weddings &quot;, to borrow your phrase.  
There definately was a procession.  Although there were no seats, people did know their places, and had room to hear.  (There was a special sound system to insure they could.).  Honors were given out specifically, not at random.  And the Roshei Hayeshiva who were in attendance added a sense of hod, of holy reverence to the entire experience.  Over 500 young men, of all &quot;stripes&quot; attended, they felt at home in the Ezras Torah neighborhood, and  their needs were attended to with delicious foods in a lovely, yet heimishe fashion.  Women were able to share in their family&#039;s simcha by enjoying the men&#039;s dancing with a large video monitor set up for the purpose.  Of course, there was ample room for them to be m&#039;sameiach the kalla.

Have I ever seen hundreds of guests suddenly stop dancing with the chosson, and run to dance around a 12-year-old wheelchair-bound special friend?  They did in our J&#039;lem wedding.  

I have now made 2 weddings, one in the States, and 1 b&#039;Aretz.   I can honestly say-- when bnai Torah are involved and the event is led by Gedolei Torah, the majesty is the same, no matter where it is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[None said:

&quot;1) What are &quot;all the paintings&quot; you have seen (citing one or two examples will be sufficient)? What are the &quot;stories&quot; you have read (one or two will be sufficient)?

2) Who are the &quot;many rabbis&quot; you keep quoting? What are their names (citing one or two of the &quot;many&quot; names will be sufficient).

Of course my questions are assuming that you are being accurate and not completly fabricating and/or overstating things...&quot;


These are ridiculous questions. It&#039;s stam meant to back someone in the corner. As soon as he gives you names of rabbis you will ask where they were ordained. Once there, you will ask for the ordination of those that ordained him too. It doesn&#039;t end. R&#039; Fink is probably the same age as I am. Over years, you have conversations with people. Experience things. And not all of these, get filed inside your brain under some file labeled &quot;Keep in case NONE asks for sources.&quot; Life doesn&#039;t work that way. I have to say, in all my experiences of orthodox weddings in LA, they were always sitting with the ayle down the center and the few weddings that I have been to Israel, both secular and religious have been standing. It&#039;s not such a kvetch to see certain Jewish practices influenced by surrounding cultures. And while I will not argue against the Sifrei, I doubt very much the reason we sit here is BECAUSE of the sifrei.

		<description><![CDATA[You stated: 

That you have &quot;no textual support,&quot; but you were soely basing yourself on &quot;observation and memory.&quot;

Then when you were asked:

1) What &quot;all the evidence&quot; is?

2) Who the &quot;many rabbis&quot; are? 

You stated: 

&quot;The evidence is all the paintings I have seen and stories I have read. The rabbis are rabbis who have mentioned things like &quot;sitting for the chupa is an americanishe zach&quot; or the like. &quot;

So again, I am asking just for the sake of understanding where you are coming from:

1) What are &quot;all the paintings&quot; you have seen (citing one or two examples will be sufficient)? What are the &quot;stories&quot; you have read (one or two will be sufficient)?

2) Who are the &quot;many rabbis&quot; you keep quoting? What are their names (citing one or two of the &quot;many&quot; names will be sufficient).

<p>1) What are &#8220;all the paintings&#8221; you have seen (citing one or two examples will be sufficient)? What are the &#8220;stories&#8221; you have read (one or two will be sufficient)?</p>
<p>2) Who are the &#8220;many rabbis&#8221; you keep quoting? What are their names (citing one or two of the &#8220;many&#8221; names will be sufficient).</p>
<p>Of course my questions are assuming that you are being accurate and not completly fabricating and/or overstating things&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Agav:&lt;/i&gt;

Looks like the good Jews of London also took on some local customs regarding sitting at a chupa. So what?

Besides, is the chuppah in the picture even kosher in the first place? It looks like it&#039;s not open to the sky!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You must be intentionally missing the point. To clarify this discussion, and not enable any miscommunication, please answer the following questions- so I could perhaps understand you position. 

1) What textual source could you cite that states that one should stand when the kallah walks to the chuppah?

2) What textual source could you cite that for &quot;500 years Jews in Europe&quot; held that Jews should stand by a chuppah?

3) What textual source could you cite that sitting by a chuppah, is due to &quot;Christian&quot; and/or &quot;western&quot; influence?

4) What textual source could you cite that Yerushalmis hold it is appropriate to stand and not sit by a chuppah?

I look forward to reading your textual citations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[See above.

What you are saying has nothing to do with what I stated, it is just another silly response attempting to distract rather that cite sources.

I have absolute respect for all mesorah in klal yisroel. Apparently you have none- you actually have no problem spitting on a mesorah of thousands of years, by saying that is based on &quot;western&quot; and &quot;christian&quot; influence. Which is a lie.]]></description>
