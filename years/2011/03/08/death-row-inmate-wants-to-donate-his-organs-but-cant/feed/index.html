		<description><![CDATA[I dont think its about feeling bad.  Its about society as a whole.  We couldnt stop  him from comitting atrocities.  He is being punished.  His life for the ones he took.  But then what?  Is eye for an eye all we are really about?  Allowing inmates like Christian to donate organs, tissue etc. Is a major help to society in a medical resource we are lacking.  If you&#039;ve never watched someone waste away because of organ failure I invite you to go to poor neighborhoods and visit those on waiting lists for years.

Christian murdered his family.  4 people.  Harvesting  his tissue can save about 50 ppl.  Then add what ever organs are viable.  Lets not forget marrow, skin graphd, cadaver bones, ligaments etc.  This horrible person who murdered 4 ppl can potentially save close to 100 ppp.  Or at least make their lives easier.  IMO, thats enough reason to support this.  Eff Christian.  Guys a POS.  BUT...the bigger picture is the point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that Carol was correct in pointing out his crime  in the context of you expressing empathy for him. 
It may be fine to allow his organs to be donated, but if we are going to start feeling bad for him, we should see him in the true light of the choices he made.

		<description><![CDATA[The penalty prescribed by law is ending his life. There is no additional penalty legislated of &quot;making him feel bad&quot; or &quot;denying his life purpose&quot;. There are some inescapably unpleasant consequences  of being sentenced to death, and the convict must bear them, but anything beyond that would be an unlegislated punishment. For example, it would not be legal to dress a death row convict in clothing purposely designed to be uncomfortable on the grounds that he ought to suffer. Neither would it be permissible to feed him disgusting food.

Presumably the court felt that losing the right to donate your organs (if there is such a right) is one of those inescapable consequences of being sentenced to death. I&#039;d be curious what their reasoning is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It depends on what the purpose for criminal sentencing is.  In FL it&#039;s punishment, not rehabilitation.  So it doesn&#039;t matter if this murderer feels bad, is sad, found Jesus, etc... He&#039;s there to be punished, plain and simple.  Giving his life &quot;purpose&quot; anus giving him anyngood feelings would abrogate his punishment.  His life has been rendered worthless by the justice system.  If not for all the worthless appeals, he would be dead by now. Punishment exacted. Justice served.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your important comments.

I understand your disgust and distaste but I have two important disagreements with you.

1) I don&#039;t think any mention of a criminal requires their crimes be graphically described. You have no idea how Christian feels about his crimes right now. In Judaism we believe in Teshuva (See: http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/06/essay-what-is-teshuva-repentance-and-how-does-it-work-in-judaism/)

2) The upshot of your opinion is that innocent folks who need a new organ should die in order to NOT let Christian feel good. I don&#039;t think this is a moral position.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After thinking about it some more, I believe that since the state has decided that his life is forfeit (i.e. his life is &quot;theirs&quot; ... ours), his organs should also be considered to be forfeit and thus *all* executed prisoners organs are &quot;owned&quot; by state for them to use or dispose of as they see fit. In general, there&#039;s no point to allowing organs that can be used to save a life to go to waste. And if you believe in such things as &quot;kapparah&quot;, perhaps the use of a murderers organs to save a life may serve as a kapparah (or an additional kapparah) to reduce the punishment that murderer will receive after death.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You stated, &quot;Waiting for execution must be the most excruciating feeling. I can’t even begin to imagine what it feels like and I can’t imagine the thoughts that go through the head of someone on death row.&quot;

I believe being between 3 and 6 years old and having your father tie rocks to your legs, then being tossed over a bridge into freezing water alive, could top that. Two of &quot;Christian&#039;s&quot; little children, I believe they were Zachary and Sadie, were chosen for that. Madison, on the other hand, was strangled, but still alive, when he stuffed her little body into a suitcase with her  dead mother Mary Jane (strangled), and tossed into freezing water to drown.

We always need to name the victims and the crime when talking about any endeavor Christian Longo is pursuing; both to honor the victims, and to help us see who he is and what he is capable of.  For context.

You also stated: &quot;He has come to grips with the horror of what he&#039;s done.&quot; Is that because he said so? After his murders he went to Mexico to enjoy his life, until he got caught. 

Taking up the cause of death row inmate&#039;s organ donation was a stroke of pure genious. Like many guilty criminals ... &quot;No&quot; is not an answer he will ever respect, regardless of who says it. His children possibly said &quot;Daddy no!&quot; (he was the only witness and we have just his version of what took place)

I don&#039;t deny more organ donors are needed. I don&#039;t know what the solution is. After the article in the NYT&#039;s, I immediately registered as a donor. But I cannot, with a clear conscience, support his cause (which is really Christian Longo)

		<description><![CDATA[The reason for the escape concern is as follows:

If an inmate registers for a transplant donor list and it comes out that he is the ONLY match for a person on the outside, the person on the outside will have a tremendous desire to get him out of prison and may even feel compelled to participate in helping him escape or petitioning for his release.

there is more to it, but thats a thumbnail sketch....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with your post (btw, there is nothing like sitting back and doing a cross word puzzle in a newspaper).

The only thing I would disagree is: Organ donation is not a “privilege”

I assume you mean, its a right, correct? But someone else has to go in and do it. Someone elses time, someone elses expense.  It may be your right to want to donate, but its a privilege that others actually go ahead and do it.]]></description>
