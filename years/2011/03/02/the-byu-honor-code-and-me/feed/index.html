		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt; For the most part yeshiva rules are even stricter than Mormon rules.&lt;/i&gt;

Like what for example?

&lt;i&gt;I have been asked many times if I felt like I missed out on the “college experience”. I always answer, yes I did miss out on the college experience, thankfully.&lt;/i&gt;

I also missed out on the college experience. Not because I didn&#039;t go to college, but rather because I went to an Engineering school and commuted from home. There were fewer than 10 female members of my graduating class of a few hundred.]]></description>
