		<description><![CDATA[Well I was answering your initial question which seemed to place the gedolim outside the purview of oversight and transparency. To that, I replied with what you have just quoted.

When it became apparent that you thought there was a choice between giving musar to &quot;everyone&quot; and &quot;just the gedolim&quot; I realized you misunderstood the point here so I clarified with my more recent comment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I must have misunderstood.

An hour ago you wrote:

&quot;But until the gedolim achieve the level of Moshe Rabbeinu&#039;s &quot;b&#039;chol beisi ne&#039;eman&quot;, when it comes to issues of tzedaka, spending and collecting of communal funds, it would be wise to follow the behests of Chazal and provide transparency so they can be above suspicion. It is in their interest to be transparent. There is no benefit to hiding, so why would you want them to?&quot; 

Were you not only talking about the Gedolim?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The musar is for everyone. Gedolim included. It&#039;s strange that you think it only applies to gedolim. 

The point was that for building a mishkan, a place of spirituality, integrity is necessary. Transparency guarantees integrity. This applies to all frum Jews. Whether they are building a home, a business, a tzedaka, yeshiva, chasidic dynasty or even the gedolim. Everyone needs integrity. Why you choose to narrow the lesson to gedolim only is beyond me...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it not just two different lessons that could be taken out of the same story?

1) To give &quot;musar&quot; to the Gedolim.

OR

2) To give &quot;musar&quot; to the wide sprectrum of Klal Yisroel.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate the response. I understand that there is a lesson for any leader, to strive and pre-empt suspicion f rom arising. However, I wrote the following additional point above, and hope that it could be addressed:

The Divrei Chazal say that Moshe Rabbeinu&#039;s practice was not even to wear a garment with pockets, lest someone suspect him.

Yet, there were those Jews who nevertheless, chose to hurl accusations at the Gadol Hador.

Isn&#039;t the primary lesson, that even with the biggest Gadol and most tremendous Tzadik, there were still individuals who suspected and accused him.

Isn&#039;t it of extreme importance for us to learn not to make the same mistake, and realize that the Gadolei Hador, are not equals, to suspect or accuse. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again, as you stated, the avlah was that the people demanded it from Moshe rabbeinu. Not that Moshe Rabbeinu provided it. The reason Bnei Yisrael were criticized was because Moshe had an impeccable reputation of B&#039;chol beisi ne&#039;eman, a lofty level of trustworthiness.

You can draw your own lessons from the midrashim. Go right ahead.

But until the gedolim achieve the level of Moshe Rabbeinu&#039;s &quot;b&#039;chol beisi ne&#039;eman&quot;, when it comes to issues of tzedaka, spending and collecting of communal funds, it would be wise to follow the behests of Chazal and provide transparency so they can be above suspicion. It is in their interest to be transparent. There is no benefit to hiding, so why would you want them to?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your point is well taken, however the words of the medrashim are clear that Moshe Rabbeinu initiated the accounting because he did not want to be suspect of any “corruption” in the eyes of Klal Yisrael. This, despite the fact the he was in the words of Hashem quoted by the Medrash &lt;i&gt;“bchol beisi ne’eman,”&lt;/i&gt; he was totally trustworthy. The limud according to the words of the Medrash is that &lt;i&gt;adam tzarich latzeis yedei habrious, kiderech she’hu tzarich latzais Yidei haMakom&lt;/i&gt; – one should provide detail to satisfy human curiosity as we are required to be detailed in our spiritual quests. . . this is learned from Moshe in our Parsha. The Midrash continues &lt;i&gt;al achas kama v’kama parnasei hatxzibbur shehein tzrichos latzesi yedei haTzibur.&lt;/i&gt;
 
As such we see the criticism leveled at Moshe, the man who was the &lt;i&gt;ish emunos rav peulos, &lt;/i&gt;by the people is what is criticized. However, his providing of an account was lauded, complemented and set as a model we are encouraged to follow. Indeed, we must Always be careful of how we speak about the leaders of our people, but we can humbly and respectfully  request they follow the standards Chazal have dictated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Was that not the whole point? Moshe Rabbeinu DID offer it (although it would still be sinful to suspect him if he had not). The Divrei Chazal say that he did not even wear a garment with pockets, lest someone suspect him.

The lesson is, that even will the biggest Gadol and most tremendous Tzadik, there were STILL people who suspected and accused him.

We have to learn not to make the same mistake, and realize that the Gadolei Hador, are not equals to suspect or accuse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess my question was, how could we draw a lesson (or &quot;model&quot;) from behavior that was sinful (accusing Moshe Rabbeinu, and demanding transparency), that we should behave the same way now? 

If anything, shouldn&#039;t it be a warning for us, not to repeat the same evil behavior- of suspecting and accusing Gedolei Torah of misdeeds?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was – because Moshe Rabbeinu was the Raya Mehemna who had an impeccable reputation and had taken us from Mitzrayim and given us the Torah et al. Evrything he did was as Hashem Yisborach commanded. Even his financial affairs.
 
However today it in not an avla – to the contrary the Halacha is paskened that taedakkah can be collected by two people but should be distributed by three. Over sight is now built into the system.]]></description>
