		<description><![CDATA[I think there are two things. There&#039;s terrorism and various kinds of murder as defined in penal codes,which represent legal judgments rendered by courts of law, and then there&#039;s the kind of judgments passed by courts of public opinion (pundits, regular joes, newspapers, etc.).

For something to legally be terrorism, it has to meet a whole bunch of specific definitions.

For something to be popularly termed terrorism, it just has to &quot;feel&quot; like terrorism. There doesn&#039;t need to be a scientific definition, just like the question of whether last night&#039;s game was a &quot;good&quot; game doesn&#039;t need a scientific definition to make the determination of what &quot;good games&quot; are. It&#039;s a subjective label.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;He may be placed in a military prison and exchanged for other prisoners of war left to sit out his days in Palestinian prison.&quot;

I hate to say this, but you&#039;re wrong. He&#039;d be placed in a military prison and then exchanged, as one member of a large group of similarly imprisoned terrorists, for one Israeli soldier or civilian who may or may not still be alive. Then he will be given a hero&#039;s welcome and have town squares and soccer tournaments named after him. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eli,
While I appreciate all sorts of intellectual pursuits, even regarding emotional subjects I must express my horror at your decision to put this tragedy in an intellectual light for a few reasons.  First of all, as you know well, not everything thought need be written. Second of all, we are all in tremendous pain over this horror, especially those of us currently in Israel and your well intentioned analysis is especially inappropriate under these circumstances. Thirdly, from a purely religious standpoint, Jews who die to sanctify the name of God are NOT subject to intellectual analysis.  
Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rachel

First of all, it seems to be that quite a few people thought I was comparing Israel and US law. I was not. The issue is really the difference between murder and terrorism.

The question your thoughtful comment raises, is how are we to know the motivations of a criminal at large?

I agree that it may have been a bit insensitive to post this today. But I actually wanted to have a discussion while we are all still emotionally distraught to exercise ourselves to think critically and try to be level headed even when we are emotional.

But, I do concede, it would have probably been wiser to wait.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m no legalist, but in historiography we talk about &#039;pragmatic truth&#039; - when we can&#039;t (which is most if not all of the time) assert what the &#039;truth with a capital T&#039; is we look for the most plausible version of truth, bearing its imperfect status in mind. While acknowledging that &#039;terrorism&#039; is an ill defined word, and acknowledging that we dont know what exactly went through the mind of the particular person who committed this heinous crime, I think we have enough evidence in this case to assume that the pragmatic truth of the matter is that it was a terrorist attack. Consider the context - Israel is NOT the USA, and the reality here is one of two politicaly defined groups battling for land. And whithin this context, the absolute majority of hate crimes commited by arabs have political motivations. And hate crimes, when they have political objectives, are usually called terrorism. On a more specific level, we have a long list of similiar crimes that were proved to be terror attacks. By the dozens, unfortunately. And to top it all, we have an immediate backgroung of political, terrorism-encourouging incitement aimed against Israelis in general and settlers in particular. So yeah, maybe the specific murderer was slightly more moved by madness/religious hate, but all the supporting evidence is against it. It seems to me that setting the &#039;proof bar&#039; in this case too high is ignoring reality, and that tying the discussion to a specific case (in which the blood has yet to dry) doesn&#039;t serve the discussion well. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Terror is different from murder because:
1. It is backed by a group or movement with political goals.
2. The intent is not merely to kill the group&#039;s enemies. Its main purpose is to terrorize the population, so they will be too scared to interfere with the group&#039;s political activities.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please at least go on record that you are censoring your commentators who are critical of your opinins (Query as to the purpose of your comment section. I do have a theory). Let me propose an idea. Why not, before posting your posts--or at least any post which my evince such emotions OR induce some to question its harmony with ikrei emunah---why not get approval from a person of repute. You write that you are a desciple of Rabbu Moshe Brown. I think that would be a great person to ask. As you would agree, Rav Moshe Betzalel is both a gaon olam and a well-read, normal individual. I have heard he is also a passionate person with a refined moral compass. I can only suspect that he would be shaken by your published opinions. But who am I to say that--ask him yourself. If I am wrong I will never post on your blog again (and eat my hat).]]></description>

(&quot;Lol?&quot;)  The fact that in your egomaniacal mind you cannot fathom that more than one person finds your comments despicable  is well, not shocking at all, and I for one think that is quite tragic. Why don&#039;t you look inward for once and second guess yourself rather than being bent on takin any and every unpopular stance in life. You hold yourself out to your readers as a rabbi and a leader of a congregation. It is high time you act like it and demonstrate some basic jewish humility. ]]></description>

You sound like the Rudolph Kastner of the frum blogging world. You are so carried away with attempting to appear as the &quot;open minded intellectual,&quot; that you throw the most precious and sacred values under the bus.

Your hurtful attempt to sterilize a massacre that is painfully fertile with blood and tears, makes the bystander wonder if you would abide by &quot;Mai chazis DeDama Didach Umak Tefei.&quot; The Gemara is warning individuals like you who have no hesitance to spit on Jewish tears, with the smug saliva of self-declared enlightenment and intellectualism.

In short, you are way out of line.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ &gt;I just wish I knew how I knew that.

Probably for what you said before. You take the entire situation, and all the circumstances into account and it leads to terror. Had it simply the parents being killed in an attempted robbery, I would not consider it a terrorist act. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Terming it a &quot;sniff-test&quot; or chalking it up to &quot;court of political opinion&quot; I think cuts to the heart of your overall mistake that is this entire article. Sometimes espousing ones thoughts couched as academic discussion is really in the end a dressed-up version of one&#039;s more primal thoughts which one has the instinct not to verbalize in public. I find your premise, analysis, and most of all, your engaging in this entire discussion to be tremendously insensitive to the poor people murdered, their family, as well as all the people out there--jewish and no--who are agonizing over these terrible events. Have we become so cold that we can really start your hair-splitting analysis? There is criminal homicide. There is terrorism, (though perhaps you are of the OBama, prosecute terrorists as crimial persuasion--I believe that&#039;s not this discussion though) And then there is unspeakable evil that should cut to every human being&#039;s essence and existence. Interestingly, I have heard more wisdom and compassion in the words of a Glenn Beck on this topic than from the jewish media at large, and sadly from you in particular. Please lend me your thoughts on Beck&#039;s post, which I think should be required viewing for any responsible blogger:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjK8M4uxcjM&amp;feature=player_embedded Why is it that Beck gets it but you (and others) don&#039;t?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i did. please read more carefully.

fatah claimed responsibility. the act was intended to terrorize. that makes it terrorism.  thats how you articulate it...

or as ALREADY defined by american law:

		<description><![CDATA[US law is not analogous. 
The US does not border an indigenous, (partially) hostile population with stated intention to commit acts of terrorism.
When you have that given, the scene of the crime was a central area of the nationalist land dispute, the perpetrator and the victims did not know each other, the perpetrator had no other reason to be in the vicinity and no other context for a grudge against the victims, the victims, including children were serially slaughtered, and oh, yeah- a terror organization took credit for their &quot;successful&quot; attack- It&#039;s terrorism.
Some times a sniff test is indeed enough. This case would have met the sniff test even without several of those factors.]]></description>

when fatah claimed responsibility, and the act was intended to terrorize, its terrorism.  just like a suicide bomber, or flying planes into the pentagon.

we look at motivation ALL THE TIME in american jurisprudence. think of the elements of murder and think about how we weigh to the mens rea in every criminal act.
