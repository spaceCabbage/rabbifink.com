		<description><![CDATA[None:

To summarize my answers to some of your questions / challenges / errors:

&gt; Muslims who &quot;hold by&quot; Sharia law are absolutely bound by the laws of the country in which they live according to less extreme versions of Islam. For example: http://www.islamfortoday.com/adi02.htm

&gt; Even if they would not agree with our laws, that is irrelevant to whether or not arbitration that is agreed upon beforehand is binding in American Law. It is.

&gt; Jewish Law is absolutely contrary to American Law. You have to be blind not to see that. All the religious laws are contrary to the American view of freedom of religion, slavery, requirement of  eidus for testimony to just name the first three that pop in my head. Seriously, what are you thinking?

&gt; There is NOTHING to FEAR about this case. It reaffirms EXISTING law. To claim it shows Sharia is &quot;creeping&quot; into America is a gross misstatement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t pretend to be well versed in the code of Hammurabi, but I do know that halachic law as applied by the batei dinim of america, is not counter to american public policy.

I find it very surprising that you think it is.

Does Rabbi Fink agree with your opinion (eg: that sharia law, halacha, and the code of hammurabi all contradict american public policy)?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[None - &lt;i&gt;Are you saying that because Jewish law could be legally utilized by a mutually accepted arbritration in the Unites States, Sharia Law should be no different?&lt;/i&gt;

That&#039;s the only way it can be under US law (which doesn&#039;t differentiate between Islam, Christianity, Judaism, etc). Do you think that there is a government department that analyzes religions to see if they have a &quot;dini demalchuta dina&quot; clause in them? Basically, the religious law can be used in civil arbitration (perhaps unless it grossly conflicts with specific US laws?).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you think if two individuals show up before a judge wanting to &quot;abritrate&quot; using their foreign pagan laws (that include bizzare clauses and laws that completely contradict the American legal system), that would be legitimate and accepted because there is legal precedent that Jewish law could be used as a means of abritration?

How about the fact that &quot;Orthodox Jewish Law&quot; has a statute of &quot;dina dimalchus dina,&quot; that states that a Jews is must abide by the law of the Country in which they reside?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Because if you are attempting to draw a parallel between the allowance of Jewish law for abritration and Sharia Law, that is not only insane- but proof of your ignorance as to Sharia Law.

Just as an example of what Sharia Law includes:

(excerpts from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia)

There are three categories of crimes in Sharia law, qisas, hudud, and tazir. Qisas involves personal injury, have several categories: intentional murder (first-degree), quasi-intentional murder (second-degree), unintentional murder (manslaughter), intentional battery, and unintentional battery. It is treated as a civil case rather than an actual criminal case. If found guilty, the victim (or in death, victim&#039;s family) determines the punishment. They can either demand retribution (qesas-e-nafs), which means execution in the case of intentional murder, imprisonment, and in some cases of intentional battery, the amputation of the limb that was lost, or they can request diyya, which is compensation (blood money), for the loss of life/limb/injury. The judge (or in modern sharia systems like Iran or Iraq, the state) can only convict, and legally punish a qesas crime on his own authority, the victim (or family) must determine that. However, the state/judge may prosecute for crimes committed alongside the murder. If the victim&#039;s family pardon&#039;s the criminal, he would normally receive a tazir prison sentence alongside the crime (such as 10–20 years in prison) for crimes such as &quot;intentional loss of life&quot;, &quot;tazir assault and battery&quot; &quot;disturbance of the peace&quot;, and such.

Punishments are authorized by other passages in the Qur&#039;an and hadiths for certain crimes (e.g., extramarital sex, adultery), and are employed by some as rationale for extra-legal punitive action while others disagree:

“The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication—flog each of them with hundred stripes: Let no compassion move you in their case, in a matter prescribed by God, if ye believe in God and the last day.”[Qur&#039;an 24:2] “Nor come nigh to adultery: for it is a shameful (deed) and an evil, opening the road (to other evils).”[Qur&#039;an 17:32]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ridiculous! If he (the Imam in question) is a licensed arbitrator and there is no impropriety in that he is beholden to one side or the other, then it is completely within the law.

Though I do have to add that I&#039;ve heard some harrowing tales of impropriety and grossly biased behavior on the part of some batei din (plural of bet din. or beis din, or &quot;court of Jewish law&quot;). So gross that it makes it hard to believe that the members were licensed arbitrators!]]></description>
