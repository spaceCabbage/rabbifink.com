		<description><![CDATA[quote: In the early days of the city, after King David purchased the Temple Mount and the First Temple was built by his son King Solomon the city of Jerusalem was not where the “Old City” is today. It was on the opposite side of the Temple Mount.
If that&#039;s so, can you please explain the position of the Kathros (Burnt) House in relation to the Kotel? According to the exhibit there, that part of the Old City was where the Kohanim lived.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;The stone tiling on the floor of the Temple Mount is a rare sight for Jews seeing as we are prohibited from approaching the Temple Mount by Jewish law&lt;/i&gt;

Isn&#039;t there some disagreement regarding this point of Jewish law? I know some very frum Jews that regularly ascend the temple mount. Though I know they are careful not to approach certain areas on the mount. Or are you saying that the particular area that is tiled with stone is the area that they don&#039;t approach?]]></description>
