		<description><![CDATA[A &quot;sincerely held religious belief or moral conviction&quot; will be something for a jury to decide.  I highly doubt any rational jury would find most bullying comments to be sincere.  The point of this part of the statute is probably to avoid a lengthy and costly litigation related to someone claiming his speech has been violated on religious grounds.  Your view on this is quite narrow, I doubt the effect you speak of will be anywhere near as serious as you seem to believe. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is, what is considered bullying?

Physical violence has never been protected under the 1st amendment.  So then what are we really talking about?

When I was in a public high school in the 1990&#039;s, the pro-gay students were allowed to wear T-shirts that praised their way of life.

When a Christian group showed up with T-shirts that simply displayed the full text of Lev. 18:22, the gay students complained that the wearing of this T-shirt was an implicit threat against them.  

When the gay students expressed their views on their clothing, it was free speech.  When the Christian students did the exact same thing, it was &quot;bullying&quot;.

This unequal treatment is what the amendment in the statute seeks to avoid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Stephan,

Your statement:
&quot;It is important to understand what may have motivated legislators to include this language.&quot;

Is exactly what I wanted to have R&#039; Fink see. There is no reason to imply some nefarious motivations behind this legislation.

At the very least, &quot;BULLYING&quot; needs to be defined. It cant simply be something &quot;offensive&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;If something is offensive I don&#039;t see why religion should make it okay. You can believe it, but in a public school there is no reason to allow it. Sorry.

Because there should be some common sense involved. If you are simply going to outlaw anything offensive—without context—than I believe you are pretty much opening a pandora&#039;s box here on what a student or teacher can say. Someone may get offended by me saying I believe marriage is between man/woman only. Am I going to be labeled a bully now? But if I am profane, crude to someone...well, schools pretty much don&#039;t allow that anyways. 

Your link pretty much says it:
&quot;But it is also the case that school administrators have a far greater ability to restrict the speech of their students than the government has to restrict the speech of the general public.&quot;

I was offended by many things in school but I wouldn&#039;t want it outlawed.

		<description><![CDATA[As an autistic person who was bullied mercilessly a a child just about everywhere except Hebrew School, I applaud your strong stance against bullying.  There can be NO excuse for bullying, and it is surprising that anyone would allow religion to be used as a justification.

Having said that, I do believe that this misguided amendment is a reaction to the tactics of radical gay activists who have defined any opposition to their agenda as &quot;hate.&quot;  Thus Proposition 8 gets labelled &quot;Proposition H8&quot; and supporters are bullied and intimidated as if anyone who supports the traditional definition of marriage must automatically be a hatemonger. In Michigan, radical gay activists belonging to Bash Back! have desecrated and vandalized a church, marching into religious services in pink hijabs, tossing condoms and shouting obscenities. (see http://blog.mlive.com/minorityreport/2008/11/bash_back_bashes_lansing_churc.html  ).  I put some of the blame for this on intolerant gay militants.  It is important to understand what may have motivated legislators to include this language.

The problem here is that anti-bullying laws are seen (falsely) by some conservatives primarily as gay-rights laws, and some are reacting to the gay activist community&#039;s blurring of the lines between legitimate political discourse and hate.  The answer to this is to carefully define what is and is not bullying, rather than Michigan&#039;s clumsy attempt to excuse religious motivation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;No I am saying that using religion as &quot;permission to speak hatefully&quot; is divisive.&lt;/i&gt;

And why is it okay to speak hatefully in all other contexts as per our constitution? With or without religion or purported religion as a background (re: WBC and Rev Phelps for example).

		<description><![CDATA[Oh sorry. You said before and after is the same.

Here is the thing, I don&#039;t know anyone that WOULDN&#039;T get into trouble saying that specific sentence. Bully law or no bully law. A student would and a faculty member would. Because it was the WAY in which it was said. I have been sent to the principle for far less crude speech. The bill that you are against, I believe, is specifically to protect against what went on on that link I sent you about the lesbian homecoming winners. Its to say that some speech needs to be protected in an ever growing atmoshere of intolerance to religious expression that others deem offensive.  Nor should you have to go to court to show that. I do not believe this bill will protect speech that simply has no place  in school even if claimed to be religious expression. &quot;F@#k you, faggot f$#k&quot; is not religious expression. It&#039;s common sense. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No.

Under the US constitution a government agency cannot restrict speech. So if a student or faculty member is punished for &quot;speech&quot; they can sue the school for violating their right to free speech.

So when someone would sue a bully they would not win because a bully is also protected by he constitution.

The point of anti-bullying statutes is to give schools the right to punish &quot;speech&quot; and not be liable for violating the constitution.

The problem with THIS statute is that it protects a bullies who bully for religious or &quot;moral&quot; reasons. So once again, the bully cannot be sued or punished by the school.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But that&#039;s the exact point. Religion is obviously going to go counter to many progressive values. Bullying would end up loosely being defining as anything potentially offensive or hurtful to anyone. So I can say that homosexuality is wrong and I can be deemed a bully. The legislature, as I said, I believe are realizing the potential slippery slope here. 

I don&#039;t know why you feel they are purposely trying to promote hate. They are trying to look at the bigger picture here. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;But thanks to the Michigan State Senate we are told that religion is precisely just that.
I disagree and I believe you are missing another side to this entirely. I do not believe that people behind this legislature want to be hateful or use their religion to demonize others. I think you are looking at this very narrowly, while they are feeling the &quot;changes in the air&quot; in our society as it &quot;progresses.&quot; Bullying is a tremendously broad term that anyone can use when they feel bullied. Meaning, as society is progressing, supposedly any disagreement can be labeled as bullying. Any measure of offense someone might receive, is going to be labeled bullying. This legislature is reading the writings on the wall and is there to preemptively avert instances where people feel they have a right &quot;not to get offended.&quot; Is it such a far fetched idea that we can get to a point where religious speech is regulated to a point where anyone (typically liberals, sorry) getting offended can file claim? 

Here is a good example
http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/10/lesbian-homecoming-bullies.html

Read the headline. Then read some of the comments on the bottom (which I was part of). The &quot;progressive&quot; commenters consistently labeled us as haters and intolerant. This is the sort of thing that WILL be labeled as bullying. 

I think this is another great article, by George Will demonstrating how policy meant  spread an agenda, often spirals out to something else, that now, you have subverted the rights and speech of others in order to protect another agenda. A leads to B, which will eventually lead to C

http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/george-will/george-will-diversity-s-compulsory-conformity/article_0915c895-ce67-5a4d-80ea-dde5b0554075.html

I truly fear these anti-bullying measures. I think this is a slippery slope to something worse, and Michigan sees this down the line. 

Another thing is, religion already has a bad rap. Not because anything we are saying new, but simple things the Left typically hates about the Bible and religion. All bullies can disappear and religion will still have a bad rap, simply because it exists and its values goes counter to progressive values. So its not like everying is just jim dandy before bullies start using religion as a defense. 


On a personal note, I was bullied. For all the things that were said to me, I would not want such statutes to have existed. I don&#039;t believe the government needs to try to step in make life as easy as possible. Bullying sucks, but I know it strengthened my character and the experience helped me be more empathetic toward others. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;The statutes are crafted in a way so as to allow the schools to punish &quot;speech&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;

Were you ever bullied as a kid? We already know that you are as an adult based on so many of the comments here! :-)
Bullying is not something that can be easily detected by adults. The worst forms of bullying are done in an extremely subtle manner that only kids can pick up on. Today, with the widespread use of electronic forms of communication (in lieu of other forms), kids may be losing the capability of almost silent and subtle bullying (and this would be a great thing), but it still exists and is nearly undetectable by adults. And even if it is detected, there is complete &quot;plausible deniability&quot; and there really is nothing any adult, or the law, can do. The truly worst forms of bullying involves no speech at all.

I think the electronic forms of communication may be a boon to reducing bullying because the schools (I think?) have the right to confiscate the devices and examine them for evidence of bullying. Certainly after the FaceBook suicide there is likely much support for such a thing. And even if they don&#039;t have the right to confiscate them, they can convince other students to voluntarily submit their devices that contain evidence of bullying of a 3&#039;rd party.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fair points. 

Here is some background. It should help:
A government institution cannot make a rule that violates the right to free speech. So technically bullying is &quot;protected speech&quot;. In fact, many bully cases made it to the SCOTUS and have been found to be protected speech and therefore cannot be punished by a government entity (like public schools). The statutes are crafted in a way so as to allow the schools to punish &quot;speech&quot;. So they help a lot!

There are rules about how schools can regulate bullying off property as well. I think if it &quot;reasonably related to school activity and is foreseeable&quot; then it can be regulated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A quick comment and some questions. I am not convinced that any of these anti-bullying laws (in 47 states) affect the level of bullying at all. I think, at best, they serve to drive bullying underground and to be done in a more surreptitious manner. At best, these laws allow somewhat easier prosecution after the fact, but even so, when it goes underground, it will be much harder to prove in a court of law.

&lt;i&gt;This makes it easier for schools to fight bullying. It also gives potential bullies reason for pause and hopefully can stave off some of the bullying that is going on in schools across America.&lt;/i&gt;

How exactly does it make it easier for schools to fight bullying? Which power does it give the school that it didn&#039;t have previously? And do you really believe that in this particular case the threat of punishment will reduce the commission of such crimes? And why in this particular case and not in other cases (murder, for example)?

Do you agree with the wording of the typical bullying law with respect to speech outside school property? I don&#039;t know how that is reconciled with the concept of free speech as it is rather chilling that so many things can be considered off bounds under loosely written laws.

Finally, as someone who was bullied (smallest/youngest kid in class, etc) periodically as a kid, I do support sensible rules and regulations, yet realize that heavy handed laws often don&#039;t work and have unintended consequences.]]></description>
