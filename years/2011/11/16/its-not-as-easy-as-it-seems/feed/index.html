		<description><![CDATA[I think that if someone takes on a leadership position in any organization (religious or not), than they should be held to a higher standard. By agreeing (or seeking) to serve in a leadership position, they have basically said &quot;you can rely on me to the right thing, even when it&#039;s difficult.&quot; Thus, I think that your anger at leaders for not making the tough, but correct choices, was justified. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Important post. While each org will need to fix itself there is no substitute for parents and children and friends and individuals fixing themselves. 
TWO THINGS WE ALL CAN DO 
1) I tell my kids (and have since they were 3) they need to keep on telling people until someone does something 
2) When our kids come to us about anything listen and dont get angry. If they tell you they broke something in the kitchen commend them for telling - dont yell about a $2 glass ]]></description>
