		<description><![CDATA[The owners clearly have the upper hand in this dispute.  The players, even though they are the highest paid athletes among the 4 major sports leagues (NBA, NHL, MLB, NFL) desperately need their million dollar paychecks because (in general) they&#039;re spending more than they earn on mansions, bling, booze, drugs, women, strip clubs, alimony and child support payments.  The NBA, more than any other sports league in America, is rife with irresponsible thugs and the owners know this very well.  The owners seem prepared to wait as long as it takes for the players to crawl back to the bargaining table with their tails between their legs begging for mercy, even if it means canceling an entire season.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[your analogies are far from accurate.

there are too many other items in the NBA model that render it a non-free market enterprise.  as such it is inherently incomparable.

nonetheless, conservatives and liberals alike, should support the NHL, b/c is isnt stupid....]]></description>
