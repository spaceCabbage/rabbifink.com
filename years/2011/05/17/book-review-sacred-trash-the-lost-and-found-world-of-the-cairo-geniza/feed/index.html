		<description><![CDATA[ &lt;i&gt;In the last century, the focus has shifted to a life of kollel, where men study Torah full time after marriage and are supported by their communities (or wives).&lt;/i&gt;

Are you kidding? Only a &lt;b&gt;tiny&lt;/b&gt; percentage of Jews have shifted their focus to what you describe here. Even if you include only Orthodox Jews, and I don&#039;t know why you would do that, it is a small percentage.

I think instead, that the focus of Judaism today has been on the visible aspects of Jewish practice. If I may coin a phrase, &quot;&lt;i&gt;pious gashmiyut&lt;/i&gt;&quot;. It appears that this new focus transcends sect and even economic level to some extent. Just take a walk through the average Jewish home, Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox. You will see Jewish artwork, elaborate mezuzot, silver items of all sorts, triple sinks in the kitchen (dairy, meat, and pareve), double ovens, washing sinks, large bookshelves filled with Jewish literature, etc. You will see elaborate sets of Shabbat (Sabbath) clothes, and hats, even to the extent that it will often include some very expensive pieces such as special kinds of hats (shtreimel or spodek). And sheitels (wigs) made of the best quality human hair. Before holidays, you will see an orgy of spending, perhaps in an effort to observe the holiday in a better way, but also perhaps in a way to outdo your neighbor (Who has the best lulav/etrog? Who goes to the nicest hotel for Pesach?). You will see elaborate synagogues, congregations, and temples. Some will have beautiful displays of artwork, of sculpture, or of rescued sifrei Torah in the lobby or in an alcove off the lobby. You will sometimes also see elaborate memorials of the Shoah (Holocaust). Look at our educational institutions and you will see campuses that had no equal in earlier generations, not even close. And those campuses don&#039;t include only areas dedicated to learning, but other things like gymnasiums, sports fields, etc. Look at our Jewish Community Centers whose facilities rival much of what the secular world can offer.

And this doesn&#039;t only apply to things that are &quot;voluntary&quot;. In the Orthodox Jewish world, many things have become religiously mandatory via the social constructs that we live with. Think of things like the Chosson Shas (a set of Talmud that is purchased for the groom that has become almost de rigueur among Orthodox Jews), the yichud room gift, the lechter (shabbat candlesticks) for the kallah (bride), the Borsalino at age 13, etc.]]></description>
