		<description><![CDATA[In the linked post above, &#039;An interesting alternative to prison&#039;, Rabbi Fink wrote:  

&lt;i&gt;&quot;I propose that criminals be monitored. Conviction of a crime is a &lt;b&gt;waiver of one’s privacy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

I agree.  This is why registering criminals is perfectly legitimate.

There is one aspect of criminal registration that I think must be changed.  We ought not register anyone who has filed for an appeal.  If the defendant does not pursue an appeal (say, within 30 days of conviction), or if his/her appeals have been exhausted, then the public should know if a convict is living nearby.

As it stands now, a person can be convicted of a child sex crime, have his/her (let&#039;s be honest, usually his) picture shown on flyers all around town, and then a few years later, an appeals court overturns the original conviction.

Overcrowding combined with good behavior can get someone released rather early, even while the appeals case is waiting to be heard.

Since we can&#039;t un-ring the bell, as it were, we must wait until our justice system has irrevocably declared a person guilty.

Registration, and the isolation and humiliation that goes with it, is effectively a life sentence.  We must decide as a society which crimes warrant that kind of life sentence, and which do not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ &#062;If criminals who have gone through the system are still dangerous, then the system has failed them. Why put them behind bars at all if they are the same person who went in?

That seems only if you assume the priority is to rehabilitate each one of them or that its even possible for the SYSTEM to rehabilitate them. 

&#062;Registries are a wasteful way of pretending to solve a problem.

But its not created to solve a problem. ]]></description>
