I agree there.

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,

You are correct that conservatives want to limit government intrusion.

One of the limited functions of government that conservatives wholeheartedly support is that of enforcing the law.

US law stipulates who is allowed to visit / work in / immigrate to the US, and who is not allowed.

If you want to lobby for a change in the law, go for it; but selective enforcement is a mild form of anarchy.

This law in Alabama, and similar efforts in Arizona, only seek to properly enforce the law.  Since federal authorities are unwilling or unable to enforce existing immigration law, these states has chosen to commit their own resources to do so.

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; E Fink - &lt;i&gt;It is being touted as sweeping legislation to solve the immigration crisis.&lt;/i&gt;

That&#039;s silly. The crisis is national in nature. At best this legislation might convince some illegal folks to leave the state for somewhere more hospitable.

&lt;i&gt;For employment. Or anything that is not a fundamental right like education.&lt;/i&gt;

So do you agree with the employer parts of this legislation? How do you define education as a &quot;fundamental right&quot;? If someone comes to the USA as a tourist for 6 months with their children, the state is required to educate them?

&lt;i&gt;See Plyler v Doe.&lt;/i&gt;

So do you agree with the higher education parts of this legislation?

&lt;i&gt;Defending from attack or from immigration?&lt;/i&gt;

Yes. It&#039;s supposed to defend from attack and regulate immigration. It&#039;s failing badly on that part.

&lt;i&gt;Open borders to law abiding folks is the best policy. I fail to see &quot;grave ramifications&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;

Perhaps. But I can&#039;t see completely open, as in unlimited in number, as being practically workable.

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Clearly this is a far reaching bill that makes the government more powerful. I have become so accustomed to hearing that conservatives want to limit governmental intrusion. This seems to go contrary to that position.
Not at all. Limited government does not mean &#039;no&#039; government. This is one of the powers Consrvatives feel government SHOULD have, which is....the issue of immigration. 

Also, the other argument is against a strong federal government taking away states rights. 

Personally, I have no problem with this law, and from a more personal level, I am not against profiling. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;It doesn&#039;t solve the immigration problem, nor do I think it claims to solve it.&lt;/i&gt;

It is being touted as sweeping legislation to solve the immigration crisis.

&lt;i&gt;When do you think it is proper for the state to verify citizenship?&lt;/i&gt;

For employment. Or anything that is not a fundamental right like education.

&lt;i&gt;Is a state legally required to educate kids that are in the country illegally? Which law provides for this requirement?&lt;/i&gt;

Absolutely. The SCOTUS decided on this issue in 1985 and it has been codified into the federal code. See Plyler v Doe.

&lt;i&gt;What do you mean by &quot;the government&quot;?&lt;/i&gt;

All government.

&lt;i&gt;defending the borders is one of the things the Federal government is supposed to be doing&lt;/i&gt;

Defending from attack or from immigration? Either way, the Federal Govt needs to get its act together on immigration. Tying it up in litigation and Supremacy issues is not going to make them move faster.

&lt;i&gt;However there will be grave ramifications&lt;/i&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;How Not to Solve the Immigration Problem&lt;/i&gt;

It doesn&#039;t solve the immigration problem, nor do I think it claims to solve it. Heck, it might even make it worse, folks with kids may register their kids as children of other people in the country legally which could lead to a future paperwork nightmare.

&lt;i&gt;the bill gives state officials permission to question the citizenship of anyone in the entire state when there is “reasonable suspicion” that the person is here illegally.&lt;/i&gt;

Let&#039;s assume it is improper for the state to do this. When do you think it &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; proper for the state to verify citizenship? And why (i.e. which section of law permits the cases of proper verification?)

&lt;i&gt;I am not an expert, but I’m pretty sure this is in conflict with established Supreme Court precedent requiring that states not make citizenship a burden on education.&lt;/i&gt;

I doubt the law says much about &quot;citizenship&quot; per se, it probably talks more about being present in the country legally or not. Is a state legally required to educate kids that are in the country illegally? Which law provides for this requirement?

&lt;i&gt;and requires all employers use the Federal E-Verify system before hiring any workers.&lt;/i&gt;

These kinds of laws have already created paperwork messes because undocumented residents simply obtain a false SSN and use it. Sometimes tens or hundreds of employees use the same number!

&lt;i&gt;1. Clearly this is a far reaching bill that makes the government more powerful. I have become so accustomed to hearing that conservatives want to limit governmental intrusion. This seems to go contrary to that position.&lt;/i&gt;

What do you mean by &quot;the government&quot;? Generally the concern is with the Federal government becoming too powerful and usurping the rights of the states to differ from one another. However, in the larger sense I agree that &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; levels of government have become too powerful (and intertwined to a much greater degree than any of us should be comfortable with)

&lt;i&gt;2) Much more importantly, this is a bill that would allow law enforcement to profile and subject anyone who looks like they are here illegally to prove their legality. There is no way that this law will not be discriminatory and degrading. There is no way to determine if someone “looks illegal” without tapping into harsh and ignorant stereotypes.&lt;/i&gt;

Depends on how you define &quot;discriminatory&quot;. If you define it as stopping Hispanic-looking folks much more than others, then yes. But if you define it as stopping folks in approximately the same percentages as they remain in the country illegally, then perhaps not. Also, I doubt the law would be implemented in such a haphazard (and very inefficient) manner of simply stopping random people on the street. More likely they would target workplaces that are known to hire illegals (or after work hangouts where illegals are known to congregate). But I agree that it is unfair to Hispanic-looking people. It&#039;s also unfair that Hispanic-looking people make up the vast majority of people in our country illegally.

&lt;i&gt;Agree with the law?&lt;/i&gt;

Not really. I think it&#039;s a political stunt borne out of frustration with DC not doing enough (not really doing anything effective) to solve the illegal immigration problem. Ironically, defending the borders is one of the things the Federal government is &lt;b&gt;supposed&lt;/b&gt; to be doing, and doesn&#039;t do very well, yet they (the Federal government) is more than willing to stick their nose into all sorts of other things that aren&#039;t really within their mandate (education and healthcare for example).

&lt;i&gt;Thoughts on immigration?&lt;/i&gt;

It seems as if we are on a path to provide amnesty (and citizenship) to many of the folks here illegally. I have many problems with this, but it&#039;s almost inevitable. The USA is not a country that can have 2 classes of people living here multi-generationally, that&#039;s just not the way we roll. However there will be grave ramifications if Asian and European folks that desperately want to immigrate to the USA learn that the best way to get here is to cross the border legally, and then remain illegally for as long as it takes to acquire amnesty.]]></description>
