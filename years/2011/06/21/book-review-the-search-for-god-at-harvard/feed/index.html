		<description><![CDATA[Hi. I wrote this book more than 20 years ago and I am thrilled to see that people are still debating it. Many thanks to Rabbi Fink for being the catalyst here (and maybe even making a sale). I continue to struggle with the issues I wrote about then. I like to think of myself as &quot;50&#039;s Orthodox,&quot; that was the era of the Orthodox Big Tent. Everyone was welcomed. No one was judged. Ultimately, it is God who judges us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oops, accidentally sent comment before I finished my thought.  The wave of fundamentalism isn&#039;t just in the USA- its also reflected in the world of Islam.  My sense is that there is a growing polarization in much of the monotheistic world between &quot;much more religious than grandpa&quot; and &quot;much less religious&quot; with fewer and fewer in their grandpa&#039;s ballpark.   The difference is that (to use a different metaphor) is that in Islam its a category 5 ideological hurricane, while in the US its maybe a category 2- some feelings are hurt, but not a lot of fatalities! ]]></description>

of them. But outward appearances began to matter more than truth so
they disposed of him.

Plus the whole episode caused him to feel excluded enough to skip

sure there would have been a way to avoid that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Battles are a personal issue.
Being a cantor is a public service.

I see no contradiction in respecting someone&#039;s personal religious struggles, while simultaneously denying them a position in a public forum. An institution should have principles they won&#039;t compromise.

Especially today, where data is driving almost every facet of life, we should be ready to accept that our actions reveal us to others, not our intentions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was my reaction to Rabbi Marc Schneier. So he he is rich, eats out, touches women- sounds like many of his congregants
 and his colleagues congregants. And that is how many acting in the 70&#039;s including his colleague. 

(Sorry for mixing him with Ari Goldman)

So the move to the right or leaving the mimetic tradition to the book tradition as Dr Haym Soloveitchik put it.. does not mean people moved to the left. But the gap between those that &quot;take some liberties with their observance&quot; and those that follow (pick your book Shulchan Aruch or Mesorah Pub equivalent) 

And those that indeed move to right may be feed up what they see around them and they fear their kids wont turn out like their parents kids

(GREAT post)]]></description>
