		<description><![CDATA[The fact that you find it detestable is irrelevant to whether its true or not. Perhaps once women start taking some responsibility TRUE progress can take affect. I think there is a lot of talk about objectifying women. But enough these same people are the ones reading Vogue, or  People or buying those products, or watching the TV shows. If you&#039;re not, then good for you.

Perhaps I am more taken aback from this Tibet because I have simply never seen such a thing ever. What is stopping Groupon from going to the Congo next?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find your repeated allusion to women being a willing party to objectification to be abhorrent. Absolutely detestable. I don&#039;t think you see the problem with this thinking so I&#039;m going to refrain from commenting on it further. I&#039;ve actually come across this a lot with men, even well-meaning progressive men who are sensitive to women&#039;s issues. So you&#039;re not alone here. I&#039;ll say one thing though and that is to think again about Rabbi Fink&#039;s comment where he said that these ads objectify ALL women, not just the ones who volunteered to appear in them. Unless the makers of the ad took the time to check with every woman, this objectifications is more certainly happening without our collective permission.

As for someone seeing an ad objectifying women and then going out and raping someone, no, of course I don&#039;t think that&#039;s likely to happen (though of course it can). The CUMULATIVE effect of all the ads, fashion magazines, etc. is the problem. One ad isn&#039;t the problem. But an entire culture that objectifies women IS.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But who goes out and decides to oppress women after watching the Go Daddy ad? or the Kardashian ad? Perhaps our differences in opinion lie in what each of us think as oppression.  The objectifying of women is not black and white, that is why I don&#039;t think they are the same. A consequence to objectifying women does not have to be rape. It can simply hooting at women when they cross the street. And considering that women are the ones putting themselves  in these positions in the media, I can&#039;t find it to be the same. 

Don&#039;t get me wrong. I am a child of LA. Its all over the place. Sometimes I feel myself to be desensitized. I have to remind myself at how bad its gotten and how to teach my girls and how bad its getting. But laughing at women willingly walking in a bikini is not the same to me as using an oppressed people (again, or their image) in your ad]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you asked a Tibetan lately about the difference you should made?

The ads about women while offensive, aren&#039;t oppressing either. They aren&#039;t oppressing because there are willing participants in it that don&#039;t consider it offensive and would probably tell you to relax and get with the times. IMO, being offended at something....ok, we got offended. But there is something inherently disconcerting about using a group (or their image) being oppressed to sell your product.

		<description><![CDATA[I think you need to stop and think a bit. You can&#039;t compare apples and oranges. The media does not  make light of anorexia or any other potential consequence of objectifying women. But in the Super Bowl ad, they are ACTUALLY USING, the plight of an oppressed group for their product. So yes, HAD Bud Light used a husband beating up on his wife to get him a beer, it would be the same. Is objectifying women bad? Yes. But the potential consequence of that such as anorexia, or women feeling they can&#039;t meet certain pre conceived notions of beauty, or men calling women babe, or chick, or witch or bitch, does not come close to actual oppression and having your rights violated. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it because you&#039;re a woman, and the issue is women that you feel this need to come charging in to protect your fellow women? Did you see  anywhere that I said that those ads shouldn&#039;t be met with some disgust or offense????? I am simply saying one cannot compare. People have gotten use of objectifying women. That is just the culture now. Its a sad fact. But I think it will be even worse if we start using ACTUAL oppression in stride in selling products.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course its bad. Its all over the place. But are they suffering? One can&#039;t compare objectifying women&#039;s bodies vs a people basically feeling oppressed. 

Yes, you should care about how woman are portrayed. But that is a separate issue, to the question of the blatant using of an obvious sensitive human rights issue to sell your product.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good post. 

I didn&#039;t love the ad, though I liked it more re-watching it now. For a Super Bowl ad, especially a long one like that, there&#039;s an implied expectation (fair or not, just is) for a strong finish. It was a bit anti-climactic, especially with the music playing, to have Eminem walk on stage and then just say a simple line that wasn&#039;t even delivered strongly (for his standards). I&#039;d also expect to have seen less driving where you can&#039;t even see the car and more of the blue collar worksmanship that makes such a car, if the ad is going to be so heavily Detroit-focused. ]]></description>
