		<description><![CDATA[For many, the statues are mere reminders of the Primary Source. They are not &quot;Sources&quot; themselves. So in effect, they are not being worshipped as gods, which means they are not idols;  &lt;b&gt;l&#039;havdil&lt;/b&gt; we have a similar concept with regard to tzitzis.

I am aware that most contemporary poskim hold that Buddha is an idol in the full sense of the word. But since I have heard others express reservations about this I was careful to say it is in question.

There is another factor that is not for a public forum but you are welcome to email me and I will elaborate.]]></description>
