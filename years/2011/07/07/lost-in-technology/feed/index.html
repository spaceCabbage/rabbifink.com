		<description><![CDATA[A picture is worth 1000 words.

But a picture is also a lie. Because it is just an instant in time. All these people &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; look at, and enjoy, their surroundings ... just not every instant of every day. They also enjoy using their phones to communicate, for entertainment, or simply to pass time. There is no objective standard that says staring into space at your surroundings is &quot;better&quot; than staring at your phone to pass the time ... or to enjoy yourself ... to play a game ... or to do anything else you like to do with it.

Finally, the quintessential photographer is arguably &lt;i&gt;worse&lt;/i&gt; than the texter. He is not only not enjoying his surroundings, but he instead is always looking out for a &quot;good shot&quot;, always positioning his very body to be in a good spot for a shot. He has that infernal camera up to his eye all the time, a camera if I might mention that is larger than the typical mobile phone. He has the damn thing in a huge bag at his side almost constantly and is so obnoxious even to the extent of flashing a bright bulb into others eyes periodically. He&#039;s often &quot;in your face&quot; and sometimes, horrors, he even hires himself out to others to do their dirty work (of capturing moments in time instead of simply enjoying those moments).
