Regular light bulbs don&#039;t have mercury in them. From what I understand, if one of these breaks it is advised to open the all windows and leave the premises. I would rather a cut then mercury ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt; I hope the marketplace will make the transition without the government&#039;s interference. &lt;/i&gt;

Like I said earlier, the marketplace &lt;b&gt;IS&lt;/b&gt; making the transition! All government needs to do is to step out of the way. Heck, the hot air generated by the regulators (and their office space, driving back and forth to work, etc) probably wastes more energy than is saved by switching to CFL&#039;s! :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There’s mercury in them thar bulbs!
 
Lets imagine you leave in Minnesota and have the misfortune to break a CFL in the winter time.  According to Jim Berlow, director of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s Hazardous Waste Minimization and Management Division (as quoted in Scientific America) you should ‘open the rooms windows, turn off the home’s heating system and have all occupants and pets vacate the premises for 15 minutes.
 
Upon reentering the home, the larger pieces of the bulb should be scooped off hard surfaces with stiff paper or cardboard or picked up off carpeted surface with gloves to avoid contact.  Use sticky tape or duct tape to pick up smaller fragments; then, on hard surfaces, wipe down the area with a damp paper towel or wet wipe.  All materials should be placed in a sealed plastic bag or, even better, in a glass jar with a metal lid.’
 
And you think this is a patrician debate with little concern for people and the environment (What’s next, mercury in thermometers?)?  What am I missing? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My only issue is that there are a small number of people (e.g., some autistics) who may have difficulty with CFLs because they are hypersensitive to fluorescent light.  Otherwise the new bulbs are a major advance so long as one is careful to dispose of them properly.   It seems foolish to hang one&#039;s opposition to government intrusion on this.  It seems a reflection of the change in priorities over the past four years, especially among conservatives, from national security and energy independence to domestic statism, that this would suddenly become controversial.  But as with smoking or street drugs, just because one thinks government should get out of the business of telling people how to live does not mean that people should indulge in stupid choices.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;I also think the new bulbs should be supported by conservatives, liberals and libertarians alike.&lt;/b&gt; All the information I have seen indicates that these are a better technology and are, better for the environment and wallet long term.&lt;/i&gt;

They are! Just not in a government mandated manner. Ten years ago, my local Home Depot had 1 or 2 models of CFL hidden in the corner of a shelf. Five years ago, the same store had 4 or 5 models on a shelf. Two years ago, they had a whole rack of CFL&#039;s. Today about half their racks are CFL and about half are incandescent. And Wal-Mart has a whole area where they sell &lt;b&gt;ONLY&lt;/b&gt; CFL&#039;s. Obviously people are adopting the new technology. I&#039;ve changed over 70% of the bulbs in my house to CFL (the rest are waiting for new switches without dimmers) because the quality has improved, both of the bulb itself and of the light they produce. I like that they save me some money and I like that they last quite a bit longer than incandescent bulbs last. Next step will be switching to LED bulbs, but they are still prohibitively priced for now. But that will hopefully change soon. Interestingly, automobiles seem to be making the switch directly from incandescent to LED directly. Which makes a lot of sense because LEDs will last approximately as long as cars last.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An incandescent bulb and a CFL both produce light. The CFL bulb is more efficient at this task and thus is more in line with conservation of resources.

An Escalade and a Camry both transport people from one place to another. The Camry is more efficient at this task and thus is more  in line with conservation of resources.

And this is the perfect analogy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ok, ill rephrase, &quot;your car releases emissions DIRECTLY into the public domain, IN AN IMMEDIATELY QUANTIFIABLE AMOUNT, your lightbulbs do not.&quot;

and that argument, that my energy use has a direct impact on the public b/c of more burning of fossil fuels - therefore there is a valid and compelling interest that the gov has in legislating how i use power in my own home, if valid (which it most certainly is not), would mean the gov could mandate that i no longer take hot showers, or use a dishwasher, or an electric oven/stove, air conditioners, etc....

lets just call this what it is/was, a stupid, over-reaching, knee-jerk, reactionary, Act spurred on by Al Gore and his merry band of fear mongerers and profiteers...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;your car releases emissions into the public domain.  your lightbulbs do not.&lt;/i&gt;

Not true. Your car may release emissions into the environment directly, but almost ANY energy usage in this country releases emissions. From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_the_United_States):

&quot;The vast majority of this energy is derived from fossil fuels: in 2005, it was estimated that 40% of the nation&#039;s energy came from petroleum, 23% from coal, and 23% from natural gas. Nuclear power supplied 8.4% and renewable energy supplied 7.3%&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you that in terms of efficiency the newer CFLs are better, but I don&#039;t understand the need for the government to make a law requiring its use (nanny state argument). The benefits of using CFLs are immediately given to the purchaser. The longer lifespan + higher efficiency = lower immediate and long term cost to the consumer. The market has reacted, with help of government incentive/subsidy, with increased sales of CFLs. There really is no need for a law commanding people to buy CFLs.
I sympathize with and, at a point, agree that this is about consumer freedom. The argument for a law requiring CFLs could be extended to replace any electric powered product that is not as efficient as the best model in the marketplace. I understand that the government CAN make laws in this way, but question whether it is necessary. If people want to buy a less efficient and more costly item, why not let them? Ex: Not everyone wants a Prius or Civic... some people want a less efficient Porche or a SUV and there&#039;s nothing wrong with that.**From a practical position not all CFLs are compatible with all appliances. In my last home we attempted to replace all the filament bulbs with CFLs only to find that the CFLs required for the ceiling fans in each bedroom could not operate on a dimmer, a key reason in getting these specific light fixtures. As a result we had to replace all 3 fixtures at significant cost.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;First of all, the government already regulates effiiency standards in other industries. Regulating light bulbs is no more an affront to liberty than an emissions test before registering a vehicle.&quot;

not a great analogy at all.  your car releases emissions into the public domain.  your lightbulbs do not.  the difference between CFLs and regular lightbulbs is energy use (CFLs use less).   But people who want to use more power are entitled to do so since they pay for it.

Just like the gov shouldnt tell me i MUST buy a hybrid, or a scooter, or a bus; it shouldnt tell me what bulbs i use in my home. ESPECIALLY if those CFLs come with the added bonus of toxic mercury when they break.

if i use a regular lightbulb in my house, it has zero impact on you.  if you want to say &quot;well u are using more energy than you need to&quot; then why stop there, lets move to LED lights since they use even less energy and last even longer than CFLs.  its a terrible argument. and the gov has no right to legislate what i do in my home.

lastly, the CFL and real lightbulbs are very different.  the light produced is not the same, both in actual light or in methodology (real lightbulbs can be used for shabbos candles in a pinch, comes in handy when traveling in hotel rooms, bring a nightlight and you are really good to go, havdalah too!)

there is no reason this should have ever been passed.  it was a knee jerk reaction to the fear mongering and panic-profiteering of Al Gore and his band of snake-oil salesmen....]]></description>
