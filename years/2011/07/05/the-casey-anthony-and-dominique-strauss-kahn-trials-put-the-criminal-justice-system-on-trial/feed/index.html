		<description><![CDATA[So once again I ask, it sounds like you have some axe against DA&#039;s. Do you? I would say she has at least SOME experience in how the game of law is practiced in the court room. More experience than you at least. Do defense attorney&#039;s practice that or not? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The difference being, the gruesome victim pictures HAPPENED. It&#039;s part of the case. Is the doubt that is trying to be implanted something that actually happened or was it just something said, with a .1% chance, to give the jury reasonable doubt? That was her point. Just because some reason is thrown, does not make it necessarily reasonable. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like this paragraph by Marsha Clark

&quot;...How? By confusing reasonable doubt with a reason to doubt. Some believe that thinking was in play in the Simpson case. After the verdict was read in the Simpson case, as the jury was leaving, one of them, I was later told, said: “We think he probably did it. We just didn’t think they proved it beyond a reasonable doubt.” In every case, a defense attorney will do his or her best to give the jury a reason to doubt. &quot;Some other dude did it,&quot; or &quot;some other dude threatened him.&quot; But those reasons don’t necessarily equate with a reasonable doubt. A reason does not equal reasonable. Sometimes, that distinction can get lost.&quot;

You are right that it&#039;s good that the law has a higher bar than the public but this woman getting off after murdering her daughter is a bad thing.

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting. From this site  it says: 


&quot;Anthony&#039;s heretofore little-known lead attorney, Jose Baez, is a former bikini salesman who had been barred from practicing law for eight years f0r failing to pay child support and secure insurance for his children. He has quickly gone from a financially troubled rookie local lawyer to pulling off what some are calling the biggest legal upset since O.J. Simpson walked free.&quot;

Doesn&#039;t sound like an attorney on rich can afford:

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s like you say, a court of law has a higher bar for conviction. When i was on jury duty, the judge made quite clear over and over again, that just because the defendent was in a gang, and just because he has a criminal past, does not mean he did anything wrong at all. They literally embed in you this notion of looking at THIS evidence and leaving everything else at the door...including common sense. 

&gt;This exposes one of the true flaws in the justice system. 

I heard, that in this case, it was simply that the state had no real evidence. I would say, therefore, it doesn&#039;t matter if you are a low-class citizen. If the state has nothing, there is nothing. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Similar regarding the DSK case. 

Possibility A: He is a rapist and it&#039;s probably not the first time.
Possibility B: He paid a hotel maid for sex and it&#039;s probably not the first time.

Regardless of the outcome, wouldn&#039;t you want to see him drawn and quartered?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be curious to know who is paying for her defense lawyer. Somehow I doubt she is receving Legal Aid benefit. I understand there was an inquiry into this, but that the results are not public.

I think that the public outrage is related to frustration over a child&#039;s death and a mother&#039;s seeming immorality. Here you have two stories about the suspect. If we are to believe her disgraceful alibi, she discovered her daughter drowned in a swimming pool and then tried desperately to hide the evidence. After dumping the body (or, allegedly, getting Daddy to handle it) she spent time partying away. Conversely, if you don&#039;t believe the alibi, she murdered the child in cold blood and dumped the body herself, and THEN spent time partying away. What a delightful set of options we have to choose from.

So I think from the public point of view, she falls into one of two repugnant roles: vicious child-killer, or disgustingly self-centered narcissist. Thus, I think that the public is angry that the punishment (or lack thereof) does not seem to be appopriate for either scenario; whether she&#039;s a killer or a pig, she won&#039;t be getting punished in either case. And the public doesn&#039;t like that outcome, for obvious reasons!

(I am aware that she technically could face an additional two years in prison for lying to a police officer. Assuming they don&#039;t just give her time served. In any event.)]]></description>
