		<description><![CDATA[If eyewitness testimony is not the most reliable would the Torah enforce capital punishment based solely on eyewitness testimony?
I agree that it is unreliable in the context it is used in the US judicial system but that does not mean it is the most accurate.  The other examples you gave have flaws too.  How hard is it to doctor a video, or place incriminating exhibits or pieces of someone else&#039;s DNA at a crime scene.  I am not saying these things are not incriminating, but they are flawed as well.  There is no perfect evidence.  I&#039;ll stick with the Torah view that eyewitness testimony is the only sentence a murderer to death.  
As for a confession, I would hardly call that evidence even if it classified as evidence by the court system.  You cannot prove anything based on the confession, you are relying on the defendant&#039;s words.  It is far less credible than any other form of evidence. People have reasons to confess to crimes they didn&#039;t commit, like protecting a family member.
In summation, the US court system is heavily flawed you happen to focus on one flaw over another.  Pitting one form of evidence against another does not say one is more credible than the next.  The easiest way to correct all this would be to get rid of the lousy jury system.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;two witnesses testimony were so extensive it was almost impossible for two witnesses to corroborate a story. 
So, does that mean eye witnesses are always lying? Or, is the system trying to purposely punch holes and cause doubt in their story? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are ways.

1) Have judges privately vet witnesses before they take the stand to determine if they are reliable.

2) Insert a jury instruction that says &quot;eyewitness testimony is not to solely relied upon. It may be relied upon with other corroborating evidence&quot;.

3) Enforce penalties against those who lie.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Eyewitness testimony is still the most accurate of evidence&lt;/i&gt;

How so?

Reliability is the most important factor in determining accuracy. Is it not? In terms of reliability, it is the least accurate form of evidence. DNA, video tape, incriminating exhibits and even confessions are better evidence than eyewitnesses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although, juries overvalue eyewitness testimony, the legislators can create a way to correct that.  The Torah is extremely careful with eyewitness testimony and for capital punishment it is the only evidence that suffices.  The legislators can learn from the extreme safeguards of the Torah when accepting eyewitness testimony.  The drishos v&#039;chakiros that Sanhedrin performed before believing two witnesses testimony were so extensive it was almost impossible for two witnesses to corroborate a story.   Eyewitness is still the most accurate of evidence, we just need to remove all bias and partiality from the testimony to know what is believable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;No. The problem is that juries overvalue eyewitness testimony.
There is no way to legislate or change people&#039;s perception of the role of eyewitnesses. It sort of goes core into the fiber of people to believe someone when they claimed to have seen Mr. X committed something. What you do is fix this by better investigating whether the eyewitnesses are valid. Ideally, that should be the job of the attorneys. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In another study:

In one experiment, jurors were given a case with a common set of facts. The evidence was circumstantial and not strong on the issue of guilt. With no eyewitness testimony only 18% of jurors voted to convict. With eyewitness testimony 72% voted to convict. The most disturbing result was when the eyewitness testimony was compromised by proof of poor vision, some distance from the identified individual and without glasses. Incredibly, 68% of the jurors voted to convict.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;They mean very little.
Is that fact or opinion? 

Everything has flaws obviously. Give us some statistics here as to how many people  have been wrongly fully imprisoned by eyewitnesses. If eyewitnesses were so bad, the torah would not demand it. So your problem should not be eyewitnesses, but that fact they are not vetted out better. ]]></description>
