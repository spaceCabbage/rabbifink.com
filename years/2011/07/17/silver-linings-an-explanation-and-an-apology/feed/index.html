		<description><![CDATA[I was paraphrasing your words, maybe I should have quoted it for clarity. &quot;then you are in a way suggesting that she is at fault if she dresses immodestly&quot; I was referring to this line.  By no means to I agree with it.  My point is that even if you were to say she did something wrong by dressing immodestly, and thus enticed someone, does not mean you are pro rape.  The man&#039;s reaction is solely his fault, no matter if the woman was completely exposed, he is still responsible for his actions.  That does not take away from her wrong, if you are saying immodesty is wrong. I am simply saying that it is illogical to say immodesty is wrong therefore rape is ok.  I hope I clarified.

Also, I think you meant to write it isn&#039;t 100% the rapists fault.  Which I agree is wrong and disgusting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Choosetoswim:disqus   &quot;shifting some of the blame on the woman that she enticed the rapist is not being pro rape&quot;

I dont know if you meant to write what you wrote there, in fact, I&#039;m not even sure what your main point was, but what you wrote in passing was this: &quot;shifting some of the blame on the woman that she enticed the rapist...&quot; implying that you are open or in favor of doing this. 

That is wrong. 
however, it proves my point, that people who are against immodesty, are open to the idea that a woman is at fault for being raped. &quot;pro rape&quot; doesnt mean women SHOULD get raped, but rather than it isn&#039;t 100% the fault of the victim for getting raped. that is just wrong and frankly disgusting. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You missed my point.  I &quot;created&quot; a conversation because he left the entire conversation out.  Hence to jump and say &quot;he made an emotionally charged (ill)logical jump&quot;  is unfair.  I pointed it out by saying he, in all likelihood made emotionally charged statements as well.  I said no more than that.  And no going from being against immodesty is not a logical jump to pro rape.  shifting some of the blame on the woman that she enticed the rapist is not being pro rape. I cannot understand your logic, sorry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@2f015ce77f1e1e6d17a7ed59448a05b7:disqus It isn&#039;t completely illogical to go from being against immodesty to being pro rape. Basically, the idea that women should be subjected to societal modesty rules is based on the idea that her actions and appearances have some sort of effect on the people around her. If that is so, then you are in a way suggesting that she is at fault if she dresses immodestly therefore she should not dress immodestly. 

@Choosetoswim:disqus  you seem to have created an entire conversation between Jonathan Becker and this other individual that never happened just so you could argue with him. Yes, the examples are different, hence apples and oranges, but the concept carries through to both examples equally. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I doubt the conversation is as simple as you state it.  Based on your version, any irrational person won&#039;t make that jump.  There were probably  emotionally charged statements that you made that triggered such a reaction (albeit an illogical reaction).  The nature of the topic is a emotional one, I doubt you spoke without any emotion and purely logical.  I do not know you and I am not saying that you are illogical or speak with your emotions, but a sensitive topic like you were discussing is always emotionally charged, on both sides, even unintentionally.

Your are comparing apples and oranges. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[fwiw: i had something like this happen to me this past shabbat. i was speaking to someone who knows me well, for many years, about &quot;slutwalk&quot;, and i spoke in favor of modesty and against &quot;slutwalk&quot; as something that encourages immodesty. the person i was talking to made an emotionally based (ill)logical jump and accused me of defending the right of men to rape immodestly dressed women (chas v&#039;shalom).  point: some issues (like rape, or child murder) are so tangled up with emotion they should only be approached with the most EXTREME care, if at all, and with a willingness to take your (undeserved) lumps and apologize even if you&#039;re making perfect sense. 2nd point: learning the hard way is sometimes the only way to learn. sorry you had to deal with this, you didn&#039;t deserve it.]]></description>
