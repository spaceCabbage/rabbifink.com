		<description><![CDATA[

Everyone agrees that gang violence is trending lower but there is little hard evidence to suggest that gang intervention programs are a significant cause.  It fact, the evidence seems to suggest that they don’t work or at least not very well.
 
The best article on the subject is a two part series that Mathew Fleishman wrote for the LA Reader.

		<description><![CDATA[Who knows if the program is working?  What you’ve got is ten of millions of tax payer dollars going to a verity of crime prevention services including third parties who hire gang member as interventionists in a scheme reminiscent of Yasser Arafat being brought back from Tunis to oversee security on the West Bank.
 
Hahn was accused of showing extreme naiveté in her dealings with convicted felon and gang member, Steve Myrick and of being party to indirectly funding gang interventionist organizations that are accused of hiring violent convicted felons and paying them with tax dollars (Clockwork Orange, anyone?).  The Fox report did make accusations of impropriety (and raised the legitimate question of whether certain individual’s past criminal record should make them ineligible for participating in government sponsored gang intervention programs – a point you seemed to dismiss as irrelevant) and your characterization that Hahn’s critics are motivated simply by a Dickensian malice at her desire to help the benighted and downtrodden strikes this reader as a tad over done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not a big deal if its being done as part of a coordinated law enforcement effort.  The DA or police can&#039;t use Bob the gang banger as an informant/interventionist, expect him to give up his life of crime entirely and then yell foul when he commits a crime and uses his good deeds to support his criminal case.  When a legislator does this, however, its a bit of a problem in my view.  I am no fan of big-city police departments and DA offices, but if they are to do anything they
 can&#039;t be undermined by legislators&#039; pet projects.]]></description>

It is understandable that a long time gang member could revert to crime even
after working as an interventionist. It&#039;s not that big a deal in my
opinion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree that the tone of the report is reprehensible and clearly is an attempt to undermine Hahn rather than provide a substantive report on the subject.  That said, it seems to me that the issue is not so much the use and payment of gang members to broker cease-fires, which is certainly valuable (though it seems to me that this doesn&#039;t really address the underlying gang problem).  Rather, the issue is that she is utilizing gang members for these interventions and then these gang members are turning around, committing crimes, and using their intervention work as cover.  It seems that the gang intervention program is more directed to ending inter-gang wars than to addressing the gang culture within each gang and each gang&#039;s directing its crime and violence against the public at large instead of each other.]]></description>
