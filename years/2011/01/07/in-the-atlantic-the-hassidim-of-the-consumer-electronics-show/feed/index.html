		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s all true, but aren&#039;t labels primarily needed for outside people to identify others? I don&#039;t think that the average frum person thinks of Chassidim as &quot;Ultra-Frum.&quot; most frum people either know or have had experiences with Chassidim and know there is nothing Ultra about them.  

Besides, as you may have read on my Wiki page, I (fake) authored a paper on my thesis that the state withing frum Judaism you&#039;ve described is primarily the fault of Hungarian emigre after their revolution.  I may not have written about it but I still believe it.
