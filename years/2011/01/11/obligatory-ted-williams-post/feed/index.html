		<description><![CDATA[This man seems very charismatic though troubled.  I wish him the best, but am a little tired of the philosophy that somehow society &quot;done him wrong&quot; or owes him something.   Productive working people are pressed and stressed just to stay afloat and do the best for their families, while so much of one&#039;s earnings go toward government programs that make it easier for illegal aliens and others who drain our economy.  Just today on the news there was something about Illinois income taxes going up 66%.    I hope Ted Williams makes good with his new opportunities.   Most of us are not in a position to offer lucrative work opportunities or take in those that are less fortunate like the Tuohy family did.  At what point does personal responsibility get any air time?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t Ted Williams from a good healthy family. A family that provided for him and even sent him to school to hone his talents? He brought shame on himself. He was not thrown into a life of homelessness and drugs. He chose to become that person. I don&#039;t see a poor man a taken in by a loving public; I see a failure given a second chance (which is a good lesson too). ]]></description>

Look, I don&#039;t care how it happened. Point is the same. We (you, me and everyone else) has an interest in the success of those who are unsuccessful for whatever reason. When talented people fail or never even know that they can contribute to society, it hurts you and me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[it is not just the homeless who suffer from this. most people, even those with jobs and families will most likely go through life without their unique talents being discovered. They are just too busy living life, earning a living, supporting their family, paying the mortgage, to pursue their real dreams, to develop their real talents. ]]></description>
