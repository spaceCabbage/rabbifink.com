		<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t object to it being taken out for a book to be used for young children say under high school age,    BUT I DO OBJECT IF IT WERE TAKEN OUT OF A BOOK for adults to read.    In that case it is just pol. correct censorship.

In fact Samuel Clements was against slavery.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kinda makes no sense b/c Huck Finn was written in 1884 and slavery was abolished in 1865 so now the US is telling us that slavery was actually legal when the book was written, but i wasn&#039;t. I think I over-thought this one. So when was slavery actually legal and illegal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh boy. Well, I think the word &quot;nigger&quot; (I&#039;m sorry, can&#039;t really bring myself to say &#039;the N-word...but apparently, it&#039;s &#039;ok&#039; for me to say it anyway....since I&#039;m Black), should be taken away from the modern-day lexicon. But I do not want it erased from history. My goodness, my 84 year old grandfather (k&#039;ayin hara) still says the word weekly! No matter what I do, to him Black people are simply niggers (especially when they behave badly).
I still want the word to be recognized, because we need to see just how far we&#039;ve come. Forgetting and/or sugarcoating the past is very dangerous. I am more than willing to throw political correctness out the window so that people will not forget this country&#039;s (the world&#039;s?) very racist past.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the N word is offensive, just as is the K word. It sounds to me that what they have done, &quot;book will remain on shelves in its present and original form. This new version is a specific version for those who want it,&quot; is perfectly reasonable. I think the purists are wrong.
