David Ferrucci, IBM&#039;s lead researcher on Watson, said in a question-and-answer session that the company sees huge potential in the health care area. Watson could help doctors more accurately diagnose patients, he suggested.

Other business applications include online self-service help desks, tourist information centers, customer hotlines and more, IBM says.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s awesome. Having heard about AI for years, decades even, and knowing that it isn&#039;t anywhere as simple as additional computing power, this is really quite impressive. Thank you for posting it!

As far as IBM&#039;s choice of what to highlight, I think it&#039;s very simple. If they choose, let&#039;s say, even if the results are an impressive reduction in traffic in certain areas, the vast majority of people will say &quot;so what?&quot; because they still see and experience traffic there and elsewhere (regardless of whether the solution provides an impressive reduction of traffic on a percentage-wise basis). If they choose hunger, and devise a program to much better route shipments to places that their device can predict require it, there will still be plenty of areas with hunger (both due to logistics and politics/etc) and people will say &quot;so what?&quot; because they still see hunger around the world. But this choice is a clear and well-understood &quot;victory&quot; by the people who will view it.

Besides, it&#039;s research at this point, practical application will [hopefully] come later. This particular piece of research may or may not be valuable someday, but like all research, it&#039;s still not &quot;useless&quot; in that it may be part of the steps to further research that can truly improve the world.

Shabbat Shalom to all.]]></description>
