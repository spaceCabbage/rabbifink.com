		<description><![CDATA[&#062;That said, your thoughts are grounded in your Orthodox belief system, and are not based on studies.
I sometimes feel a constant need for studies is simply a mark of too much hyper-intellectualism. Do we really need a study to show us a society is better off with certain social norms, such as marriage? A little wisdom can take one much father than a study.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Dr.

Thank you for commenting.

It is true, I come from a perspective of an orthodox Jew. I have an opinion. It is not fact nor is it stated as fact. It is a belief. But I believe it is a reasonable belief. I am not trying to &quot;prove&quot; anything. I am trying to offer an opinion that I think others might appreciate or enjoy thinking about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Rabbi: I cannot personally agree that marriage adds something &quot;more&quot; to a relationship, because I never cohabitated sans marriage prior to my marriage 42 years ago nor since being married, and I certainly would feel uncomfortable if my children ever lived with someone outside of marriage.  That said, your thoughts are grounded in your Orthodox belief system, and are not based on studies.  That&#039;s why you can conclude that marriage adds more--more what?  The blog would have been just fine excluding the last paragraph in which it sounds like you are then trying to prove something to someone--can&#039;t be done.
