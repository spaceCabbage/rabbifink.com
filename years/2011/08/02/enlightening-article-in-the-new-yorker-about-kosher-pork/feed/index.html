		<description><![CDATA[Well, as you know I read a number of those site (including YN and VIN), and while I have on occasion seen comments that were extremely blinkered, there has rarely been anything that offended me - but by the same token, types mining those sites for offense will find something, often entirely innocuous, that they can blow up into an evil Jewish plot, or evidence that Jews despise gentiles. They will find what they look for. Even if it isn&#039;t there.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[C&#039;mon you know what I meant. Why is that every time somebody has something to say you try discrediting it by picking on some little nuance.  Be fair.  You seem to have a very hard time accepting that others may have valid points so you nitpick to fiend some little inconsequential point to argue on.  If  you have a real reply, than respond, if not leave it be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People should be careful about what they write or say always.  This is not only about non-Jews reading the sites but about anybody reading the sites.  I cringe when I read what idiocy people post on these sites.  People just don&#039;t care unless they see an immediate harm.  It is like the story of two girls chatting on a bus about a friend who had just gotten engaged and they just couldn&#039;t believe she would want to marry such a terrible boy.  The lady sitting in front of them turned around to thank them for this information, and was now going to tell her daughter to break off the engagement.  The girls went into a frenzy, backtracking on what they had said and trying to convince the mother that it was indeed a good match.  The mother wouldn&#039;t hear it and was adamant that she will have her daughter break it off.  As the mother, got off the bus she turned to the girls and said &quot;I am not the mother, but what if I was&quot;.  The lesson is obvious, but I think there  is a more sublime message we all miss when hearing this story.  It is about the nature of people, we do not think about our actions until it is too late. We need to think before we act or speak or post a comment.

As to your second point, while it would be nice for everybody to be articulate and well spoken, reality is that not everybody will be.  I do not mean this as a criticism, but you,as a law student should not be making grammatical or spelling mistakes in your posts, but sometimes you do.  People do not take the time to edit what they post and spelling mistakes go unnoticed.  Also, everybody&#039;s literacy will be on a different level.  I am sure if you read posts from other ethnic groups you will find the same.  Maybe the moderators should edit the comments so that it appears everyone is well spoken.  You cannot teach everybody to be super literate.]]></description>
