		<description><![CDATA[&quot;such questions and analyzing their 
answers does not prove or disprove the validity of religion in general 
or a specific religion in question.&quot;

So even if you believe that the other religions are false they can be valid. Let the others have their religion. What they do is their business. The important thing is that we focus on what we know to be true.

Problems will arise when they try to force all or part of their religion on you or condemn you to a lower social status because you do not share their religion.

That&#039;s why Dawkins and others evangelize. Because of the natural inclination of religious people to impose their beliefs and practices on others.
