		<description><![CDATA[Solid points as always.

What concerned me more than Dershowitz ignoring the more typical halachic perspective on who is a Jew is the criteria with which he subsitituted those traditions.

I mean, &quot;he didn&#039;t pitch Jewishly&quot;? Is he being serious?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two notes:
&quot;According to Jewish law Branca is a Jew.&quot; That&#039;s not strictly true, primarily because there is no single code called &quot;Jewish law.&quot; As, I&#039;m sure you are aware, there isn&#039;t even a single Orthodox Jewish Law. As it so happens, virtually every legal work that we would call Orthodox would obligate Branca in Jewish law (I&#039;m not sure that many have a position on semantic arguments). Equally, most Reform authorities would say that, as a practicing Catholic who in no way identifies with Judaism, Branca is not Jewish.

It&#039;s also worth noting that Dershowitz wasn&#039;t asking who is Jewish in the eyes of halacha but who would be called a &quot;Jew&quot; according to the general understanding of the term. Given that &quot;Jewish&quot; is primarily understood in the sense of &quot;adherent of Judaism&quot; (which Branca doesn&#039;t fit at all), then in the ethnic sense (Branca partially fits) and finally in a cultural sense (I have no intuition on the matter, Dershowitz doesn&#039;t seem to feel the Branca fits), Dershowitz&#039;s position seems reasonable enough. 

Whether a practicing Christian can be considered a &quot;Jew&quot; was actually the subject of an Israeli supreme court case, which ruled that for the purposes of the Law of Return he cannot be. http://books.google.com/books?id=iVJR9UZnTVAC&#038;pg=PA173&#038;lpg=PA173&#038;dq=%22In+opposition+to+rabbi+hai+gaon&#039;s+opinion,+there+are+other+authorities%22&#038;source=bl&#038;ots=5E4WuthYnl&#038;sig=JgDzMODLGmgyVCWGb3kgrLkMDy4&#038;hl=en&#038;ei=LHFMTuu3KOjf0QGjp-mDBw&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;ct=result&#038;resnum=1&#038;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=true]]></description>
