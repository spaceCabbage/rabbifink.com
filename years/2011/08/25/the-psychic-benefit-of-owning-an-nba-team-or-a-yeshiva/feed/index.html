		<description><![CDATA[That may be true in a past era when schools, yeshivos, cheidarim, mikvaos, tzedakos, and other &quot;communal&quot; organizations really were run by the community - i.e., by the local kehillah as a political entitiy either directly or through elected representatives, reviewed and overseen in an &quot;abuse of discretion&quot; manner by the kehilla-appointed rav or beis din.  Now, the reality is that these institutions are most often privately owned and run, in this paradigm, we can vote only with our wallets . . . ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Yeshivos are opened for to serve the community. They are opened simply so that there are yeshivos for our children to attend.&lt;/i&gt;

This is completely untrue as a general statement. There may be some yeshivot opened as a community service. But there are &lt;b&gt;MANY&lt;/b&gt; opened to make money and often primarily to provide [lifetime] employment for family members and extended family members.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a good point, but I think there is one major flaw in your analogy.  A millionaire might spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a Van Gough, even though its a losing proposition financially, but at the end of the day, he&#039;s a millionaire and can afford the financial costs of his psychic benefit.  The guy making a few hundred grand a year, on the other hand, may be able to scrape together all his savings and buy that same Van Gough, but unless he can be fairly sure that the work will go up in value, the purchase would be obviously ill-advised indeed.  True, our schools and Yeshivos cannot be run simply as businesses, but I think its a bit misguided to treat them as paintings by the masters either.  The truth is, we as a community have limited resources.  We can&#039;t just &quot;invest&quot; our money into pet project schools simply for the psychic benefit, just because a school is there and is teaching our children doesn&#039;t mean we can or should pour our money into it as it continues to lose &quot;value&quot; (financial or educational).  Just as we wouldn&#039;t support a school that does not offer a decent educational return on our investment, so too should we be cautious about putting our money into schools that, while perhaps educationally viable, cannot be expected to survive due to gross financial mismanagement.  Administrators shouldn&#039;t run their schools as businesses, the bottom line must always be educational success.  Nevertheless a balance must be struck between meeting educational goals and recognizing financial realities.  Drawing the line is hard, and it is to the skilled few who do so well that we should be turning.]]></description>
