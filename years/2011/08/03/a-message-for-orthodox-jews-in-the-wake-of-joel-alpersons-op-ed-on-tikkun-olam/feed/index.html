		<description><![CDATA[&quot;My way or the highway&quot;  Which sect of orthodox Jews have such an approach.  I have encountered all types of orthodox Jews an none have shown such an attitude.  Whilst there is disagreement about hashkafa and beliefs, there is still respect even in the heat of battle.  There are those who do not show respect (which are in every sect of both OJ and non OJ) but it has nothing to be with being orthodox, it has to be with not being raised properly, or some other outside reason (other than their religious affiliation).

BTW, I find it a bit comical that your are preaching respect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have never seen any frum Jew, of any hashkafa, treat a Jew who has never received a yeshiva education as &quot;persona non grata&quot;.  (Those who know better and run off to become public and vocal enemies of G-d are another matter.)

While we must not treat people like etrogim (i.e. I&#039;m doing a mitzvah with &quot;it&quot;), there is too fine of a line between respect for the non-frum Jew as a fellow Jew, and respect for his/her ideology.  When Reform leaders speak of &quot;mutual respect&quot;, they mean the latter, and that is impossible for frum Jews to do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s nice to hear you welcome non-Orthodox Jews at your shul.

At my non-Orthodox synagogue we also welcome Orthodox Jews. Although one time I just chatted outside with an Orthodox guy who was there for a family bar mitzvah but who didn&#039;t feel comfortable coming inside.

I think we&#039;d all be better off if we spent more time learning from each other.]]></description>
