		<description><![CDATA[You seem to be taking this awfully personal. This is a blog. The rabbi wrote a post. Nobody is actively forcing upon you anything. We are stating our opinions (as you are). Our opinions differ from yours. We are against them for reasons XYZ, irrelevant if this is between you and God. Many things are between you and God. Does that mean opinions can&#039;t be stated? I will go even further and state Judaism is all about matters between us and God, yet it still finds itself regulating behavior. I find kiddush clubs at shul to be something that reduces the sanctity of the place....which comes before your ideals to socialize. In the end, nobody is sticking a gun to your head.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Going to a Kiddush Club is hardly akin to a mugging. And, I DON&#039;T think it is wrong. That is exactly the point I wanted to make - that some of us feel that what we are doing is not wrong whether others agree or not. And, it is not just drinking that draws us. Our Kiddush club is about Achduth, mainly - and about commemorating a Yahrzeit or other such event. And, yes. We do like to savor a fine single malt - at least I do. But not all of our members drink. Some are there just to socialize. That is why I asked that others &quot;live and let live.&quot; What we who go to Kiddush Clubs do is between us and the Rebono Shel Olom and is not anyone else&#039;s business. And that goes for what you do as well. I would certainly not try to encourage anyone who did not wish to partake to come and join us. But when I have observed the people who are vehemently against Kiddush Clubs I have usually found that they engage in activities that I would be appalled at. So I would suggest that you simply Choosetoswim or Nottoswim and let me do the same. Have a Good Shabbos.]]></description>

I am just replying to a rather silly comment you made. OBVIOUSLY, I was only giving an opinion. It&#039;s not like I can force anything upon you. This IS just a blog you know. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ Thanks for having the courage to take a positive position concerning Kiddush Clubs. 

Instead of concentrating on more serious matters such as intermarriage or outreach, the rabbis attack the Kiddish Club because it is an easy target.

We have consistently about 50 Kiddush Club members who, because of the Kiddish, make a special effort to come to shul every week – no matter the weather.  Even the chazan is known to join the Club at its weekly meeting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First let me say, Rabbi Fink, you are right on the mark and it is about time someone said this. A minor correction is in order, however. It was not The Jewish Week that Rabbi Shmuley&#039;s diatribe appeared in but The Jewish Press.
I would also like to add a few thoughts. There are people who go to Kiddush Clubs and people who do not. I respect the views of those who refrain from going but these holier than thou people need to (1) learn to live and let live and (2) realize that they themselves are not perfectparagons of religious life because they do not participate in Kiddush Clubs. I recall an incident when I once came into shul and asked someone how the Yankees had fared the previous night.One of these holier than thou individuals wh had overheard me, began berating me for bringing this unholy subject into shul. About 20 minutes later, this same individual was discussing the stock market with one of his friends. 
Finally, a word of advice to Rabbi Shmuley. I noticed that the Jewish Press stated he was a  &quot;fifth year doctoral candidate&quot;. Get a life and finish your degree, Rabbi. Five years is too much time for this. But, maybe you are too busy worrying what other terrible things you can blame on Kiddush Clubs. Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb stated that Kiddush Clubs lead to Loshon Hora. He fails to realize that people speak loshon hora and would do so  with or without Kiddush Club participation. Rabbis need to emphasize the positive aspects of Judaism, instead of constantly telling us what not to do. It is their negativism that has turned Jews away from religion and certainly not Kiddush Clubs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OK, so 5 oz. of wine is the equivalent of a 1,5 oz shot of 8 proof spirits.  

So one drink is a freebie, even if it gives you a buzz.  Beyond that you can drink as much as you want as long as you don&#039;t show your drunkenness?  How about if you tend to slouch and not speak clearly, even when you&#039;re stone cold sober?

		<description><![CDATA[You know what I mean. I think its a manner of respect and some level of kedusha. The Cohanim represent the people as they approach God. We don&#039;t have that anymore. Instead, it is us that approach God. It is that one day a week where we are not in a rush to get to work. It&#039;s a day meant for some sort of sanctity. You are approaching God in prayer, and then leave right in the middle to have a drink and talk about something that can wait till later??? I think it minimizes of what the shul is for FIRST, which is a place of worship. Socializing is important, but there is a time, place and proper way to do it while at the same time mainting the proper kavod for God and the occasion]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eliyahu, I absolutely cannot wait for next week&#039;s topic. I can just picutre you trying to come up with it now.
&quot;Hmmm, what really hot controversial topic that NO ONE seemingly sides with, can i possibly figure out a far-fetched excuse based on my own version of pure logic to argue on behalf of, and pretend as if I support, just to stir some nice controversial conversation and debate and rile up some discussion on my blog for???&quot; 
A Rabbi being pro Kiddush Club??? That&#039;s great cause for some nice discussion. It&#039;s like having our very own Jewish Shock Jock! I&#039;d love to see what happens when all your congregants get up and walk out during your speech to joke and shmooze and drink!
You&#039;re right that the whole thing about drunkenness is a little far fetched, but it&#039;s just funny how you feel the need to go to the other extreme and SUPPORT it, just to show your disagreement with the article!

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;There is no place for drunkenness in shul. It is prohibited to pray while inebriated.&quot;

What&#039;s your definition of &quot;drunkenness&quot; and &quot;inebriated?&quot;   A blood alcohol concentration of 0.08?  0.1?  Most fully grown men can toss back a drink, or even two, and remain perfectly within those limits, if a little &quot;buzzed.&quot;

Whether this sort of activity is disruptive or not depends on the floorplan of the shul, I would think.  At my shul, I am a &quot;member&quot; of a de-facto kiddush club, except that we have no booze.  In fact, &quot;B&#039;nai CA&quot; is run by a bunch of Jewish Baptists, we only serve grape juice at the real kiddush.  It&#039;s not an official policy, but if a kiddish sponsor brings wine instead of grape juice, the nasty looks they get.... 

However, there may be something to be said to hold off on the schnapps until after the services.  One reasonable setup I saw was at a Conservative synagogue in San Antonio Texas, where they had a table with the schnapps and herring on the way out after services.  They also served lunch, which reduced the risk of drunk people (or rather people with a BAC over 0.08) driving home.  (Remember this is a Conservative shul in the suburbs.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not for or against these &quot;clubs&quot; and I usually just roll my eyes when I read about rabbis or groups of rabbis acting as through they have the right to remove what remaining autonomy there is left. It&#039;s like an out of control congress passing laws right and left, though when the rabbis do it, its pathetic, since they&#039;re usually yelling at the wind. 

Where I go, there is a one man club. It&#039;s one guy who heads back sometime during krias hatorah. Anyway, about two weeks ago, he&#039;s in the kitchen and they reached the end of the kriah, and I heard him, from the kitchen, yell out &quot;yakum Purkan min shmaya.&quot; He was trying to speed things up. Thought that was kind of funny. 

Re the social factor, orthodox Jews aren&#039;t meant to have social lives. If you went to a RW yeshiva, pretty much your whole teenage life, from morning to late at night,  you&#039;re locked in the building. By the time you get out, you just want to go home already. Places and activities are banned. They&#039;re trying to bring a little of that to shuls I guess. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My opinion - kiddush clubs should not take place &lt;b&gt;during&lt;/b&gt; davening. Not because of any religious rule, but because it makes a lot more sense having them after davening to eliminate time limits (for example when a scintillating conversation begins) and to allow the folks to recover while walking home afterward (Mussaf shouldn&#039;t be the recovery period!). And alcohol absorbs much better with some food in the belly. Drinking a shot or two on a completely empty stomach isn&#039;t recommended.

There is no way kiddush clubs cause alcoholism, and anyone giving teens alcohol (at a kiddush club or elsewhere) is breaking the law. But teens seem to always find a way to acquire alcohol - especially when we make it something forbidden. I think the French and Italians have a better idea. They serve alcohol (usually wine and/or beer) at meals even to youngsters, and thus, for the most part, alcohol doesn&#039;t have the &quot;allure of the forbidden&quot; for the teens in those countries (though lately some teens there ape the drunkenness portrayed in many films from the USA). Claiming any sort of causation of kiddush clubs to alcoholism is asinine.

In my shul/minyan, we have kiddush after davening every shabbat of the year. Most guys will have a drink or two, but every so often we get someone that goes overboard. A few years ago, we had one person that had to be banned (from alcohol) because he clearly couldn&#039;t handle it properly. We also have one person who needs to have his intake limited and we are sure to do so. Obviously the scotch is stored under lock and key (more securely than the sifrei Torah we joke). In addition, some of the guys have an additional kiddush club at their homes on a rotating basis. Finally there are a few, &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; few, guys that skip out during the haftorah for a quick shot. I&#039;ve never done that for two reasons, first of all, it&#039;s only 20-30 minutes until kiddush anyway, and second of all, it&#039;s only 8:40 in the morning at that point!

Finally, shul should never go till midday. That&#039;s insane (people will be hungry and bored - which totally destroys kavana for many). Two hours is more than sufficient, so if you start at the latest at 9 (we&#039;re not talking about Chassidim that sometimes start at 10 or later) then you ought to be done at 11, or on weeks with certain additions by 11:20. In my minyan, we start at 7:25 and finish at 9 or 9:15, and that includes a drasha between 7 and 10 minutes.

To summarize, davening should be shorter and kiddush should be right after davening.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haven&#039;t had a chance to read the source article just yet (tomorrow, hopefully), but I have to say that I can&#039;t go along with the kiddush club.

I remember the kiddush club at the shul I attended for many years. Firstly, the participants tended to be quite disruptive, especially after imbibing. They didn&#039;t make a ruckus or anything, of course, but drunk congregants talk, and talk, and talk some more. Secondly, it was obvious that some of these participants were flat-out drunk. Maybe not frat-party drunk, but not sober enough to drive - and certainly not to offer a proper prayer. I think the word they use today is &quot;buzzed&quot;. Lastly, it was an obvious influence on the younger attendees. Inevitably a few of the tween set would try to casually sidle up (or get profferred by one of the participants) in order to &quot;chap a schnapp&quot; under the auspices of &quot;becoming a man&quot; or whatever they say in justification when they give kids a taste of alcohol.

I&#039;ll give you - I doubt kiddush clubs are a primary cause of alcoholism or anything like that. But there&#039;s things that belong in a shul and things that don&#039;t, particularly during a prayer service. I think it&#039;s even more egregious to call it a kiddush club, as if it has some sort of religious connotation. It should really be called the &quot;I am super-bored by the service and I want to knock around club&quot; or maybe the &quot;I need an excuse to have a shot at 10:30 AM club&quot;.

Think of it this way: if your shul had a cigar club, and they would leave during the service to smoke cigars, and children would occasionally wander in and have a puff, how would you feel about that?]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Haven&#8217;t had a chance to read the source article just yet (tomorrow, hopefully), but I have to say that I can&#8217;t go along with the kiddush club.</p>
<p>I remember the kiddush club at the shul I attended for many years. Firstly, the participants tended to be quite disruptive, especially after imbibing. They didn&#8217;t make a ruckus or anything, of course, but drunk congregants talk, and talk, and talk some more. Secondly, it was obvious that some of these participants were flat-out drunk. Maybe not frat-party drunk, but not sober enough to drive &#8211; and certainly not to offer a proper prayer. I think the word they use today is &#8220;buzzed&#8221;. Lastly, it was an obvious influence on the younger attendees. Inevitably a few of the tween set would try to casually sidle up (or get profferred by one of the participants) in order to &#8221;chap a schnapp&#8221; under the auspices of &#8220;becoming a man&#8221; or whatever they say in justification when they give kids a taste of alcohol.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you &#8211; I doubt kiddush clubs are a primary cause of alcoholism or anything like that. But there&#8217;s things that belong in a shul and things that don&#8217;t, particularly during a prayer service. I think it&#8217;s even more egregious to call it a kiddush club, as if it has some sort of religious connotation. It should really be called the &#8220;I am super-bored by the service and I want to knock around club&#8221; or maybe the &#8221;I need an excuse to have a shot at 10:30 AM club&#8221;.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, so what about moving the kiddush to between shacharis and mussaf, then? Or just provide a 15 minute intermission; let people walk around, shmooze, snack, learn a bit, whatever. 

I&#039;m not a fan of those who say that kiddush clubs promote alcoholism (though I do have to question if the focus on quality booze is really any better than the much decried focus on chullent), but I can&#039;t really support any idea that the proper behavior (or even &quot;a proper behavior&quot;) should involve skipping either haftora, the Rabbi&#039;s speech (although the Rabbi himself may have a different view) or both.]]></description>
