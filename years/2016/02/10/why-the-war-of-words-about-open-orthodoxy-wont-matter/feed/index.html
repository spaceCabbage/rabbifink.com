		<description><![CDATA[Great essay, but this line requires clarification: &quot;Soon, no one will care what Rabbi Gordimer or Prof. Marc Shapiro said about the kashrus of Open Orthodoxy.&quot; 

This may suggest some kind of symmetry between the positions of R. Gordimer and Prof. Shapiro.  In fact, Prof. Shapiro has not taken a stance on the &quot;kashrus&quot; of OO.  R. Gordimer&#039;s agenda, in contrast, is clear. 

Also, Prof. Shapiro is an independent scholar, whereas R. Gordimer has just admitted that he writes with &quot;the continuing encouragement and authorization of roshei yeshiva and poskim, mostly not from the yeshivish world.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree in part.  Things will be more decentralized, yet people will still seek out authority figures and leadership because there is the issue of specialization; most people don&#039;t have the time, talent or inclination to deeply understand halachic issues, but want to feel they are good people doing God&#039;s will.  The difference will be in how they choose and judge the leaders they turn to.  Those leaders authority will not come so much from rising through the established power structures as it will come from a demonstrated high level of scholarship which is clearly based on a modern Western understanding of the concept of Truth.  People want truth, not blind commitment to 1000 years of exilic stringencies.   People will go back to the Toarh roots, and reject harmful customs that came about during the long exile.  Why should a woman who ovulates prior to the 12th day not have children just because Babylonian Jews where trying to out frum their Zorastrian neighbors 1500 years ago?  Why would people wait 6 hours after eating chicken when the Talmud didn&#039;t even require kinuach ha-peh?  That&#039;s were things are going.  There will still be authority, but of a different kind which is based on modern concepts of truth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;You can influence and inspire an inclusive future or waste more time sustaining a divisive Quixotic Crusade disguised as an imperative war. We’ve made our choice. You make yours. Choose wisely.&lt;/em&gt;

Interesting that you would ask someone to choose wisely. Wisdom is something accumulated with age and experience. Have millenniums accumulated enough wisdom that something like open orthodoxy is a viable alternative? Is it just another fad of the time? Does it have a solid anchor that will allow to be passed down from generation to generation? Neo-chassidus? Online communities? How far can that really go before the next generation gets bored again and it needs to be changed? Is there any viability for the long haul? Im very skeptical about any of these new fads.

I agree with you, there is a problem. I don&#039;t know how much of it is  that authority is stifling vs. millenniums just don&#039;t care for the concept of authority. I think depending on the community, it&#039;s a combination of both. If it&#039;s an issue of authority being stifling to personal expression and experience than that needs to be addressed. If it&#039;s simply millenniums continuing the 60&#039;s proverb of &quot;Don&#039;t trust anyone over 30&quot; with a 21st century twist, than eventually, I believe they will grow up. If they want Judaism to continue as a religion, and not just a flavor of the month experience, than rules, boundaries and authority will automatically be a value they will accept eventually (to varying degrees obviously). But to present everything that is going on, as some Quixotic crusades makes it seem like you have been asleep for the last 150 years and that we have no patterns of evidence of what happens to a movement as it gets more &quot;liberalized,&quot; for a lack of a better term.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you suggesting that Millenials don&#039;t play poker? Because unless they are somehow immune to the challenges of voluntary communal enterprise, why wouldn&#039;t they be subject to the very same calculus of the Hobbes/Locke Social Compact in terms of establishing group norms and pursuing collective goods? I.e., even if the appeal to authority is based on voluntary participation, it still has utility, as do the institutions that shape communal life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting but I&#039;m not sold.
While I&#039;m not in the &quot;all Mesorah all the time&quot; camp of certain Rabbis, to say that we will effectively get rid a of all authority is an overreach. 
In this context, my hope is that this pushes Rabbis to be more learned, educated, and able to answer the tough questions. Leaders that can lead rather than responding with &quot;Da&#039;as Torah!&quot; or &quot;we don&#039;t ask such things.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;*** QUOTE 1 OF 3: ***&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rambam&lt;/i&gt;’s &lt;i&gt;Hilchot Teshuvah&lt;/i&gt;, chapter 3, paragraph 8:&lt;/b&gt; 
 If any Jew denies that even ONE WORD of the Torah is Divinely-revealed, then he or she is a heretic &lt;i&gt;apikuris&lt;/i&gt;].   

In the same paragraph, &lt;i&gt;Rambam&lt;/i&gt; teaches that any Jew who denies the Oral Law [&lt;i&gt;Torah SheBeAl Peh&lt;/i&gt;] is also a heretic [&lt;i&gt;apikuris&lt;/i&gt;]. 

 In paragraph 6 of the same chapter, &lt;i&gt;Rambam&lt;/i&gt; teaches that a heretic [&lt;i&gt;apikuris&lt;/i&gt;] has no place in the afterlife of the righteous, and will be punished eternally.  

&lt;b&gt;CHRONOLOGY:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Rambam&lt;/i&gt; was born in 1134 CE in Córdoba, Spain and died in 1204 CE in Egypt.

&lt;b&gt;*** QUOTE 2 OF 3: ***&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pele Yoetz&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Perek Apikuris&lt;/i&gt; [Heretic]: &lt;/b&gt;
“And it is not even necessary to teach that a person who doubts the words of the Torah or the words of the Great Ancient Sages [&lt;i&gt;divrei Sofrim&lt;/i&gt;], or mocks even one word of the Torah or one word of the Great Ancient Sages [&lt;i&gt;divrei Sofrim&lt;/i&gt;], he is a complete heretic [&lt;i&gt;apikuris gamur&lt;/i&gt;]; and behold, he has abandoned the faith, and denied a foundation [of the Jewish faith]…”

&lt;b&gt;CHRONOLOGY:&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;Pele Yoetz&lt;/i&gt; was completed by Rabbi Eliezer Papo (&lt;i&gt;Sephardi Tahor&lt;/i&gt;) in Bulgaria on April 28, 1824 CE.
 
&lt;b&gt;*** QUOTE 3 OF 3: ***&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mishnah Berurah&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;siman&lt;/i&gt; 126, &lt;i&gt;sif katan&lt;/i&gt; 3:&lt;/b&gt;
“Understand that according to all opinions [literally, according to the entire world], that if we know that he [a Jew] denies the Resurrection Of The Dead [&lt;i&gt;Techiyat HaMetim&lt;/i&gt;], or that he does not believe in the future redemption [&lt;i&gt;Geulah HaAtidah&lt;/i&gt;], and how much more so if he does not believe that the Torah is divinely revealed [&lt;i&gt;Min HaShamayim&lt;/i&gt;], or [if he does not believe in] reward and punishment; [then] according to all opinions, he is a complete heretic [&lt;i&gt;Apikuris Gamur&lt;/i&gt;], and it is forbidden to allow him to act as prayer leader [&lt;i&gt;Shaliach Tzibur&lt;/i&gt;]…”

&lt;b&gt;CHRONOLOGY:&lt;/b&gt;
Rabbi Yisroel Meir &lt;i&gt;HaKohen&lt;/i&gt; Kagan, was an Orthodox Rabbi who lived from 1838 CE to 1933 CE in Poland.  He wrote the &lt;i&gt;Mishnah Berurah&lt;/i&gt; from 1894 CE to 1907 CE.

		<description><![CDATA[Not sure what this all means. Authentic Judaism does (should?) consider Tanach and Hazal as authoritative (how this manifests in actual practice can be a matter of debate and discussion), so authority per se won&#039;t disappear. And to the degree to which is does within Modern Open Orthodoxy, we may witness a slide into neo-Conservatism. Also, group identification will not disappear, and this does entail adherence to certain norms which bespeak authority of a sort. That said, Judaism has actually been much more more dynamic, less monolithic, less static, than many are aware of today, especially those in the haredi world. For example, we find in the Book of Maccabees that men and women prayed together in synagogues. And yet R&#039; Moshe Feinstein said separation for davening is &quot;de&#039;oraitha&quot;. Another different sort of example: once the common practice was to eat cheese right after beef, doing qinuah hapeh in between, and now most Orthodox Jews are unaware that about 50% of the Rishonim held this way... the list showing that indeed many things have changed over the centuries goes on and on. This will keep on happening. Most are stuck in a very temporal perspective.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Now, authority must be based on sound reasoning and meaningful arguments&quot;

*eyeroll*  Did Rabbi Fink fail to notice that Donald Trump is the leading Republican candidate?

People don&#039;t care what&#039;s true.  Yes, things will change--they always have--but people aren&#039;t going to suddenly care about what&#039;s true just because of the Internet.  The Internet spreads misinformation just as fast as information; the antivax movement was born on and spread via the Internet.  Even pre-existing false things are barely affected.  The Mormon Church is doing fine despite the no-fooling viral popularity of this guy&#039;s letter: http://cesletter.com/

That letter is just a summation of what we know about the origins of the Mormon church.  How many Orthodox Jews do you know that have ever used the Internet to examine whether Orthodox Judaism is true?  Never mind what they&#039;d conclude, why did they never even think to, say, google it?  After all, they&#039;d probably say it&#039;s the most important thing in their life, and if &quot;authority must be based on sound reasoning and meaningful arguments&quot; surely they&#039;d apply it to the most important thing in their life?  But they don&#039;t, as you can tell by the fact that you&#039;d struggle to name a few who did.  They don&#039;t even read the books they say they believe are the only ones the only god wrote! (How many Orthodox Jews have read all of Tanach?  Can even accurately describe what&#039;s in each book?)

Authority is how people decide what they will believe, even when they&#039;re right.  When someone today says he believes the Earth is round, he&#039;s believing that for the same reason a peasant in 782CE would say she believes the world is flat.  How people form beliefs has not changed; it&#039;s just that today&#039;s guy happens to be right.  He believes in viruses he&#039;s never seen just as medievals believed in demons they&#039;d never seen, and he would fail horribly to justify how &quot;we&quot; know that viruses are real things, unlike demons.

I don&#039;t know how the Internet will change how authority is formed and maintained, but Rabbi Fink&#039;s utopian prediction that it will magically cause authority to be vested in truth via evidence and reason is naught but naivete.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are certainly familiar with the principle of 2Jews=3Opinions. You are probably also aware the this is not a simple arithmetic progression. Depending on the Jews selected for the sample, and the number of opinions that they start with; it can be either a geometric progression, a factorial expression, an exponential explosion or a Fibonacci Sequence. This effervescence is one of our sources of strength.

Less well recognized is its corollary. He (or she) whose practice is more stringent than mine is a fanatic. While he (or she) whose practice is less stringent than mine is an apostate. Because our own practice is always the reference it an be difficult to even imagine that, in fact, this holds true from one end of the Jewish continuum to the other.

I wouldn&#039;t lose any sleep over it. For some you will always be a fanatic and for others forever an apostate. You&#039;ll be just fine as long as you&#039;re secure in who you are, and make engagement with the texts your grounding. You will also need to be part of a community, to which you provide support. One that returns that support to you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;  I think the majority of MO Jews would not read an article about the Torah on Wikipedia, because it&#039;s heretical. There are plenty of heretical books out there, but most MO Jews ignore them because they&#039;re forbidden reading.

An important difference is that one doesn&#039;t usually stumble across books with heretical ideas, but you can easily come across a heretical article clicking links on Wikipedia (or elsewhere), and spending a few minutes reading an article while you&#039;re already reading things online is more likely than sitting down to read an entire book you happened to find.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Here’s the thing. The next generation of Modern Orthodox Jews are Millennials who grew up in a digital world where authority is routinely challenged. Fact-checking teachers was easy even when we had only Microsoft Encarta. Today, Google allows us to fact-check from our phones before the authority finishes their sentence. Now, authority must be based on sound reasoning and meaningful arguments, not fear or shame.&quot;

I wonder how much the Internet really changes things. There is so much readily accessible information online, yet Modern Orthodoxy still manages to insulate itself pretty well from all this. It might be that I&#039;m 27 and 10 years older than Millennials, but I think the majority of MO Jews would not read an article about the Torah on Wikipedia, because it&#039;s heretical. There are plenty of heretical books out there, but most MO Jews ignore them because they&#039;re forbidden reading.

I hope the Internet does have the effect you suggest in this article. I think it will definitely have some effect. I wonder how much though.

Also, I don&#039;t mean to suggest all MO Jews are unread, but it does seem that the majority are pretty insulated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re kind of saying that Ashkenazy Judaism is going to eventually (pretty quickly if it will include the millennial generation) become like Sefardim* with regards to denominations within their community. [I was actually looking for such a sentence mentioning the historic Sefardi lack of denominational separation in the concluding paragraphs.]

* Perhaps with the exception of the recent shift of many dati Sefardim to become Ashkesefard (i.e. adopting Ashkenazy charedi affectations - dress, exclusionary behavior, insularity, lack of participation, disdain of work/focus on learning, etc)]]></description>
