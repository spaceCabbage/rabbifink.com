		<description><![CDATA[You can&#039;t be a Fox without foxing the hedgehog as well as everything else. But the hedgehog will claim that it is unfoxable by anyone other than a hedgehog, i.e. someone who also foxes. And you can&#039;t fox everything but the hedgehog, because then you are being just as much of a hedgehog as the hedgehog is, and you are being hypocritical in calling yourself a fox. Translated: By definition, someone who wishes to incorporate all views into their own worldview, must also attempt to benefit from those who don&#039;t do so. However,  those very people will claim that a true understanding of their worldview can only come if no perversions from other worldviews accompany it. And if you choose to simply incorporate most worldviews, but not ones that disagree with that approach, they can rightfully claim that you are being hypocritical.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Everyone is different.  There are some people that do not see orthodox judaism as complex...its a much simpler question.  Is it true.

If one is convinced its false, made up, etc. maybe that person would not be comfortable living that lifestyle.

You are making this more complex than it needs to be]]></description>
