		<description><![CDATA[What do you hope to gain from &quot;closeness for the sake of being close&quot;? I know, nothing- it&#039;s just for the sake of being close. But as someone in kiruv who works closely with many conservative and reform Jews and who sees the vast chasm between the denominations, I&#039;m not sure why you think we should be close with them. Our views are drastically, diametrically oppositional, and what is there do gain? They disagree with everything we believe in, so what is there to be close about? At best, they are tinokos shenishbu, but I don&#039;t think it would be beneficial at all to work together with them. 


That having been said, I am certainly in favor of having a cordial relationship with them as fellow Jews, so if that is what you meant, then I am on your side. But from the perspective of working together, I don&#039;t think there is anything to work on together.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;We cannot cannibalize non-orthodox institutions.&quot;  -Rabbi Eli Fink


&quot;Shun evil and do good, seek peace and pursue it.&quot;  -Psalms 34:15


While I appreciate the sentiment that Rabbi Fink wants to &quot;seek peace and pursue it&quot;, we learn from Psalms that the prerequisite for pursuing peace is for us to &quot;shun evil and do good&quot;


Now; telling my brother/sister, my fellow Ben/Bat Yisrael, that violating shabbat is keeping shabbat; that eating treif is eating kosher; that responsive reading and guitar-led melodies are fulfillment of the required liturgical prayers.....these are very evil acts indeed.


Perhaps we can say that the &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; doing these acts aren&#039;t evil, but merely horribly misinformed.  Still, the deceptions themselves are evil, and run afoul of another Biblical command:


&quot;...you shall not place a stumbling block before a blind person, and you shall fear your G-d. I am Hashem.&quot;   -Leviticus 19:14


So yes, we must indeed limit the ability of horribly misinformed people to place stumbling blocks in front of our very own flesh and blood.  


If free access to halachically correct prayer quora and halachically accurate Torah study accomplish that end, all the better.




&quot;No one is really deciding between orthodox Judaism and conservative or reform Judaism.&quot; -Rabbi Eli Fink




False. 


I did.  I know dozens of others who did, as well.


I am personally insulted that you think I would lie about my own spiritual journey.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No need.  Who in their right mind wants to join the charedi/yeshivish communities?  In this day and age?  Kiruv will die on its own,

Ilan feldman was right, but he didnt take it far enough (ironically, he is pretty darn black hat/right wing....and i think he is a leader of a community but doesnt change?!?!?!  What a weak leader!!). Who would want to join a group that completely isolates itself from other non observant jews, will tell you not to eat at your parents house, will have nothing to do with the goyim in the neighborhood, willl not get involved in community activites (unless its shomrim, hatzala, etc). Why oh why!?!?!  

This world, this country is amazing, why would i throw that all away and seclude myslef amongst irrational loners?   Yes, e. fink seems like a nice enough guy, but he is the exception.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are plenty of formerly Conservative Jews at my current Chabad shul.  My family&#039;s traditional Conservative shul was quite good at producing a number of kids who grew up to be observant and engaged Jews - but many of them are not doing so within the Conservative movement.  I would agree with a previous poster, though, that while some did go on to be full-fledged black-hat BTs, many chose to lead Conservadox lives within Orthodox or Chabad settings.  For example, I know tons of families from my Chabad shul who send their children to Camp Ramah.

I&#039;m wondering if Chabad and some other kiruv groups are actually creating a new way of Judaism altogether, as opposed to simply trying to persuade Jews to become Orthodox.  There&#039;s plenty of attraction to programs that reach and out serve all Jews, where all are welcome regardless of current level of observance, dress, etc.  At some point, does this open approach become a value in itself, as opposed to just being a means to an end?

As for cannibalism other movements - I think that competition can be an impetus to change and discard ineffective practices.  The old model where congregations could assume that families felt compelled to make a Bar Mitzvah and could therefore strong-arm those families into a few years of synagogue membership and Hebrew school did not produce committed families.  Instead of grumbling, it would serve the non-Orthodox movements better to look at what Chabad and other kiruv groups do well - and do it better, while pointing out what unique points they have to offer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You gotta love lines like this one, though it seems hard to believe they are written seriously:

&quot;He goes through some of the tension between orthodox kiruv workers and non-orthodox rabbis as well. One thing I had not thought of was the free Bar Mitzvah lessons and free admission to services on the High Holidays severely cutting into the bottom line of conservative and reform congregations. This is an area that needs to be addressed. We cannot cannibalize non-orthodox institutions.&quot;

Let&#039;s see. Competition is generally allowed. The restrictions that do exist are lifted when it comes to teaching torah since teaching torah is more important than the melamed&#039;s income. Note this is for another Orthodox melamed, not a reform institution. Are you seriously saying we should be concerned that by providing free Orthodox training or services, the Reform will lose &#039;customers&#039;? Even coming from you, that seems a bit much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think there&#039;s too much meta-conversation lately about kiruv, focusing too much on labels, stratification, zero-sum games (i.e. cannibalization). Torah is what binds all Jews together in a way distinct from non-Jews, so helping Jews fulfill more mitzvot, whether keeping kosher and shabbat or just attending services on holidays is a good thing if the Jew wasn&#039;t doing that before. Remember, Torah has no such proper nouns as Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, Chabad, Aish Hatorah, etc. Only when egos, budgets, and jobs are on the line do the &quot;problems&quot; arise. And G0d is present as readily in humble urban shteibles as in grandiose suburban synagogue architecture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Many of the &quot;engaged Conservatives&quot; (good term) - as was my family - found Orthodoxy to be more &quot;authentic&quot; and those practicing it more committed as a lifestyle, not just a movement.  I don&#039;t know if Kiruv does affect that population, but the notion that there is a &quot;common cause&quot; between Orthodox and the other streams seems to me false. I see a great deal of intolerance and hostility on both sides of the divide.  Orthodox kiruv absolutely wants to &quot;cannibalize&quot; the other groups, for they see them as not legitimate, as perverting the Torah.  BTW, there is little common cause between Chabad and the other Orthodox groups.  Chabad has its own agenda.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps the apparent contradiction can be explained by what appears two paragraphs later in the article - the establishment of quotas.   Those that need to meet a quote might be looking for ways of taking credit for those that entered Orthodoxy organically, skewing their statistics.   e.g. Some one joins the OJ community on their own and a few months later attends a class given by a kiruv professional on campus.

		<description><![CDATA[So JTS wasn&#039;t really founded to have the mission of &quot;conservative Judaism,&quot; per se, rather to do &quot;positive historical Judaism,&quot; i.e. critical text analysis/etc that wasn&#039;t allowed in traditional yeshivot. I believe that was a factor in why Rabbi Saul Lieberman [who was fully orthodox in observance (in addition to full shmirat mitzvot, wouldn&#039;t even daven without a mechitza), his JTS affiliation notwithstanding], who was a Slabodka alumni, and whose wife [the daughter of Meir Bar-Ilan] was the founding principal of Shumalith School in Brooklyn, chose to take a position at JTS even though R.

    That role has to a large extent been taken over by Judaic Studies departments (many of which have a large number of orthodox professors-Emory&#039;s Judaic Studies department has at least 6 associated professors who are members of my shul [Young Israel of Toco Hills]), but it&#039;s not dead completely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;One thing that seemed improbable to me was the assertion that most kiruv success stories are formerly conservative Jews. My experience has been the complete opposite. That is, the less one knows about Judaism, the more likely one is to become frum.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;


Without demographic surveys, our evidence is all anecdotal. But I think it depends on the setting.


Perhaps in Yeshivish kiruv, the unaffiliated Jews form a plurality of &quot;baalei teshuva&quot;. I don&#039;t know. Also, could your experience be colored by the people who impulsively stop in at the PJC while walking on the boardwalk? That&#039;s probably not a typical scenario.


In my personal experience, a huge number of Orthodox Jews I know, including my wife, come from engaged Conservative backgrounds. For those people, it&#039;s less a result of a kiruv operatives, but rather a social adjustment, as they simply hang out with a more Orthodox group. This is very common in singles communities like the Upper West Side, where there is a large part of the Shamor Shabbat spectrum straddles the line between Orthodox and Conservative. Thus, on Shabbat mornings, people attend all sorts of different shuls; Modern Orthodox, Conservative, or independent minyanim like Hadar and Dakhei Noam, which occupy various parts of the space in between. Then those singles will join together for lunch. Often those singles are even roommates, as with a friend of mine, who was firmly Modern Orthodox, and shared an apartment with his firmly Conservative roommate.


With that kind of mixing, which I suspect is similar on many college campusus, it&#039;s inevitable that people will flow from one side towards the other (and vice versa, for that matter).


So I think that Wertheimer may be right about a huge number of Conservative Jews ending up Orthodox, but I&#039;m not sure that he&#039;s right that their Orthodoxy is a result of organized kiruv efforts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;One thing that seemed improbable to me was the assertion that most kiruv success stories are formerly conservative Jews.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

On secular university campuses in the Northeast this would seem to be the case, at least when I was in college some time ago.  The more right-wing Conservative Jews who grew up in committed homes, went to Camp Ramah where  Kashrut and Shemirat Shabbat were taken seriously, find themselves disappointed with the lackadaisical community on campus.  An intellectual, liberal, modern, Orthodox community, also typical of campus communities, holds more appeal and they make the switch.    However, this switch is usually not kiruv worker influenced but he may not realize that.  The numbers of formerly committed Conservative Jews who were davening with the Orthodox minyan by the end of sophomore year seemed to definitely surpass the successes of Chabad of other organized outreach.]]></description>
