		<description><![CDATA[I should add that I&#039;ve always loved this idea. One can feel overwhelmed by the demands Torah asks of us, some of which can at times seem impossible. And it is easy to despair that a struggle with one requirement of Torah makes the entire attempt to engage in a spiritual, Jewish life, pointless. But the message here is so much more encouraging! Even if we can&#039;t keep all of the mitzvoth today, each mitzvah we do, no matter how small or seemingly irrelevant, is always meaningful and can still lead us to a closer relationship with Hashem. I&#039;d like to read this post as suggesting something similar.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Or perhaps neither is true. At the time, people didn&#039;t have easy access to books, I&#039;ve read that many people had access to only one or two books in their  lifetime (one of those usually being the bible, and the other almost definitely a religious book as well). So if people only had access to a tiny number of books, and that they were mostly religious in nature, it is very likely that they looked toward books in a generally very reverent manner. And if the only book you had access to were, say, a New Testament, and if you read that book over and over again (remember, it&#039;s all you&#039;ve got access to), and if you approached books in a reverent manner, there is a decently high possibility of being strongly influenced by said book.


On the other hand, today, with access to countless books, and libraries galore, and online access to many times that amount, we naturally treat the material less reverently, and we are much less likely to be strongly influenced by any single book, certainly not to the extent of being swayed to a different religion.


I therefore conclude that this halacha is modified in our time, and if a person is sophisticated enough and learned enough and committed to his/her faith enough, reading such material is permitted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rambam had it the wrong way around. People aren’t drawn to
what they study, they study what they’re drawn to. That’s the main reason that
internet communities turn into echo chambers. People look for information and
associate with people that bolster the beliefs they already have (generally
speaking, of course.)]]></description>
