		<description><![CDATA[I used to be miserable because I could not get married in my 20&#039;s because I was not the right kind of guy for most women that wanted one type of guy. I had my big chance. I could hev gone to a yeshivah that takes baalie tshuvahs and came out freshly minted from being this so-so confused creatively inclined modern ortho guy into a black hatter and I would have been fine. I just couldn&#039;t do it. So I remained single for another 10 years.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Early marriage is idealized for many reasons. One of the reasons I have heard is that it prevents drifting.&lt;/i&gt;

While I think you have a lot of good points, the unstated take away tip would be - don&#039;t rush into marriage.   There&#039;s one &quot;small problem&quot; with this for the meticulously observant Jew:  sex drive.  

I don&#039;t have any ind of formal study to support it, but I think it&#039;s safe to say that as the average American has pushed back marriage, the number of people who have waited to engage in sexual conduct until after marriage has dropped way down. 

Maybe I&#039;m being too Freudian, but I think sex drive and the desire for intimacy is subconsciously responsible for said drift of twenty somethings.   And - if you&#039;re chasidish,  It could start off as innocently as flirting with someone from the opposite sex who was not screened and approved as your shidduch date.

It&#039;s not about locking them into a particularly stringent kashrut standard, but keeping them chaste while single.

Rabbi FInk, If you don&#039;t mind sharing, I&#039;m curious:  How did you meet your wife, how old were you when you got married, and how many years later was your first child born?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with this post 100%. 70 panim b&#039;torah. However, I think there are two many people who want to keep the status quo. Its hard to find people who like the idea of different forms of though outside of the MO world. Many Rabbis believe that to keep people from straying we must keep things extremely rigid, but unfortunately that pushes people out. I think the best way to do this is to create more open minded institutions, where people can ask questions, and aren&#039;t taught &quot;our way or the highway&quot;. There are such places, but not enough IMHO.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your analogy is cute (cats always are), but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s apt. Firstly, articles like these make it seem clearer that people in each of your belief-camps are more frequently crossing over into one another&#039;s ranges, but also I think that the particular issue in play here is not the interplay between the two camps but even within each one where the only differences are relatively minor about mostly Minhagim rather than wholesale life outlooks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; There&#039;s a wide range of acceptable differences within Halachic Judaism (how long to wait after eating meat, how many minutes after sunset does Shabbos end, etc.). 

I’m pretty sure you meant this seriously, but it reads like a joke. “You can have
any pet you want: a white cat, or brown cat, or a black cat, or even a white-and-brown cat!”

Orthodoxy is by definition narrow. The subsets of Orthodoxy even more so. A MO guy who believes that halachos should be grounded in the real world and a Chassidishe girl who is awed and inspired by the thought that her keeping kabalistic minhagim is shaking the heavens are going to have trouble finding a community to live in and a school for their kids that’ acceptable to both of them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wrote about this a while ago: http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/12/yeshiva-boy-journaling.html

as a teenager&#039;s reliance on his parents lessen and he is supposed to begin to learn what things he enjoys and what his interests are, this progress is knocked down by his rabbis who stress the supremacy of Torah study above all else, effectively preventing the discovery of new ideas that he would be attracted to. What is called &quot;chizuk&quot; or &quot;a musser shmuz&quot; encourages him to continue in this single minded path, eschewing all other pursuits that would hinder his efforts in becoming the next great Gadol. (That&#039;s actually not a bad idea for a reality game show, &quot;The Next Great American Gadol&quot;) He moves onto bigger yeshivos where a herd mentality exists and affects the way he dresses, speaks, acts, and dictates what he should be interested in. All this accomplishes is holding off the self discovery that all people are meant to go through. That&#039;s why he marries young to a like minded girl, and that&#039;s all it takes. He is now cemented into this sort of life before he has a chance to learn whether he really wants it. The college student may spend a year talking various classes to find what field interests him, but not the Yeshiva boy.]]></description>
