		<description><![CDATA[&quot;And it will be, when the Lord your Gd grants you respite from all your enemies around [you] in the land which the Lord, your Gd, gives to you as an inheritance to possess, that you shall obliterate the remembrance of Amalek from beneath the heavens. &lt;b&gt;You shall not forget!&quot;&lt;/b&gt;   Deuteronomy 25:19

We know that some of our ancient sources associate Amalek with a branch of Edom (Esau), one known as Germamia, or possibly Germania.

(No, not all Germans are Amalek, not even most Germans - this is only to say that this area of the world is where Amalek can/will emerge.)

Perhaps our people are subconsciously sharing this Biblical commandment with the nations of the world.

Obliterate Amalek, and do not forget long enough for (it/him/them) to resurface and gain power.



You shall not forget!]]></description>
