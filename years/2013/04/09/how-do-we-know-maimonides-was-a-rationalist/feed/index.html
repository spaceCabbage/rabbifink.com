If you have not seen these books, you may enjoy Maimonides: Reason Above All by Israel Drazin http://amzn.com/9652294314 (and some of this others). In addition to providing both evidence and argument to this point, you may find his examples interesting too. Moreover if you read the Amazon reviews you&#039;ll find your &quot;4 sons&quot; of reactions from cheers to jeers to this claim.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whether or not the Rambam rejected mysticism depends a great deal on how you define mysticism.  A broad definition of mysticism will include all Torah Jews (think about tumah and taharah).  It might be more useful to imagine a mystic continuum.  The are mystic maximalists (e.g., Rabbi Avraham Abulafia), mystic minimalists (e.g. Rambam) and mystic moderates (e.g. Ramban) and many more all along the continuum.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You can definitely write a book about this, and it surely will be banned, and that will make it an instant best seller.  

If Ramba&quot;m goes against the Bavli that usually means there&#039;s a Yerushalmi supporting him, though i&#039;m not expert enough to know if that&#039;s true in this case, plus him choosing the Yerushalmi over the Bavli in a case could directly support your point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;&lt;i&gt;So either he uses a variant text (I have not seen any manuscripts with this text)&lt;/i&gt; ...&quot;

That&#039;s interesting.

How about the text in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21485&#038;pgnum=267&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;She&#039;iltot Rav Hai Ga&#039;on, No.31&lt;/a&gt;, or in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20394&#038;pgnum=539&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Halakhot Gedolot, Hilkhot Nidui&lt;/a&gt;( or in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20341&#038;pgnum=206&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hilkhot Birkot ha-Meqomot&lt;/a&gt;), or in the writings of other &lt;i&gt;Ge&#039;onim&lt;/i&gt; who followed the &lt;i&gt;She&#039;iltot&lt;/i&gt;&#039;s version?

Couldn&#039;t the Rambam have simply followed the &lt;i&gt;Ge&#039;onim&lt;/i&gt; who preceded him, regardless of his views of mysticism?]]></description>
