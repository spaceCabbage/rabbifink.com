		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt; &quot;These are not isolated killings, they are part of a culture of killing and death. We are going to ignore isolated murders because terrorism fits more neatly into the latter category.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;

Terror doesn&#039;t fit into systemic murder either. Terrorism is killing for a political gain, which is unique and different than gang killings.

&lt;i&gt; &quot;These are the conditions that are ripe for violence: Little hope of improving one’s situation, a culture where violence is mistaken for bravery, where education is not valued and hard to come by, and primitive views of “might is right” prevail. This is what our gang culture looks like in the USA.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;

Gang killings are against (usually) rival gang members. The motive is anger, opportunity  jealousy or some combination thereof.  What you argue is what potentially enables -- the moral justification -- for the seemingly evil action. No escape as well as being part of a small group of people that normalize these values may justify the actions, but it is not the motivation for it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; Fink - the problem isn&#039;t that the Boston Bombers are outliers.  It&#039;s that they *aren&#039;t* outliers.

		<description><![CDATA[Reminds me of the dentist who told me he could solve the Israeli-Palestinian issue by sending dentists into Gaza. &quot;Tooth pain will drive someone to want to blow himself up.&quot; He explained.

Your explanation of &quot;socio-economical&quot; factors fails to explain a crucial point: why do some people become terrorists?. Not everyone who grows up in those surroundings follows that path. Some do find ways to improve their lot. ON the flip side, not every terrorist grew up in abject surroundings. Some have pointed out that the Boston bombers were relatively privileged. You know who else grew up in  privileged surroundings and became a terrorist? Osama Bin Laden. 

Certainly the leaders of these movements tend to prey on the disadvantaged when recruiting for their cells--these targets have less to lose. But without a preexisting belief in the cause or thourough  indoctrination, a terrorist is not &quot;born&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s assume that these two brothers from Chechnya had a killing idea deeply rooted in the recent war between Muslim Chechnya and Christian Georgia. Russian government had sent troops to help Georgia in it&#039;s territorial and also religious military conflict with a small region of Chechnya.
 Young men and women of Chechnya responded with an extremely violent attacks against Muscovites ( mostly targeting not the government officials, but civilians and particularly the places of gathering of the younger people- movie theaters and schools.) Their motive was a deeply rooted pain from having been objected to the suffering and death at their Homeland.
When Chechnya asked USA for help - the answer was not what they expected - instead of weapons and troops they have received an open gate to emigrate. The rejection of their call for protection triggered an anger and their national identity was shrank and that had seeded the long lasting pain. 

In Boston marathon tragedy - the younger brother just followed his older sibling. Islam may have played it&#039;s role as well, but mostly - degrading and offended the brothers found the false consolation in desire to put their name on the Chechnya identity map.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; Fink - unfortunately, your opinion (that terrorism is a product of a &quot;nothing to lose&quot; millieu) is contradicted by the cold hard facts (including several studies).  First, a brief anecdotal point - the Tsernaevs are a particularly poor example on which to pin the &quot;nothing to lose&quot; explanation.  They grew up in a good area, going to good schools (Dzokhar, for example, won a scholarship to college), had things to live for (Tamerlan, for example, had a wife and child).  Second, the study conducted by Kreuger and Maleckova of the National Bureau of Economic Research established that there&#039;s simply no causal link between poverty or lack of education and terrorism; terrorists are as likely to be from economically advantaged families (think Osama Bin Laden) as disadvantaged.

As the late Dan Patrick Moynihan once put it, while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, nobody is entitled to their own facts.  And the factual predicate of your opinion is simply wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m quite happy to explore correlations between crime and socio-economic status. 

I think you&#039;ll have a much harder time with correlating specifically terrorism and socio-economic status. Osama Bin Laden was quite wealthy and could have lived quite well. I can&#039;t think of a terrorist who became rich from terrorism. If they achieved higher social status from a particular society, than that questions your underlying thesis.

I&#039;m quite happy to concede &quot;Blame Islam&quot; as being incredibly lazy, not least because it isn&#039;t very actionable in terms of preventing future attacks. But socio-economic status is even less actionable.

Work harder Rabbi. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems that you tried very hard to come up with a different reaosn as to why they set out to kill innocent people (as opposed to gang members and other killings you described).

I&#039;m safely assuming that the murderers of more than 98% of cases in the USA had a reason for killing, be it a gang member from an opposing group, a spouse who cheated (or the person who cheated with a spouse), a hold-up for money, they all had a reason for killing that specific person. Whereas these two bastards set out to terrorize and kill innocent people, and I could not think of any other reason for that besides religion, unless if they were people with &quot;criminal minds&quot; - highly unlikely for various reasons, or mentally challenged people - also not likely given their reputation in school.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most of the examples of murder that you are referring to (and that we are familiar with) involve some aspect of gain for the perpetrator. In other words, there&#039;s something in it for the murderer.


Gang murder =&#062; enforce territory, retain markets, instill fear among the locals.
South African blacks =&#062; end apartheid.
Spouse killing =&#062; eliminate troublesome spouse.
Drug cartel murders =&#062; instill fear, eliminate opposition (both law and outlaw), reduce competition, and ensure absolute loyalty.
Communists =&#062; instill fear, eliminate opposition, etc.


In general, people do things because there is some benefit to them for doing those things. Even altruism can often be looked at through this prism.


But in this case, blowing up a few spectators at a marathon, I don&#039;t see what the possible gain is for the perpetrator. I can&#039;t think of any gain (other than some metaphysical one pushed by religion). Random murder with nothing to gain is indeed very rare, that&#039;s why investigators always look for relationships first, and that&#039;s why the random cases (such as this one) are so difficult to solve.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In your example, yes, there are &quot;a million things&quot; that happened during that person&#039;s life, and few would say the main motivation behind his shooting her was because he has an anger-management problem (though I would not discount that being the truth in some circumstances. However, based on what you wrote, you maintain that religious fundamentalism is just one of the million things, and economic conditions plays a much bigger role, offering no evidence to support this. There is much more to support the idea that radical faith is the leading motivating factor for many terrorist acts, beginning with the statements of the terrorists themselves, which is consistent with the method of killing.*


* If the reason behind their desire to kill is economic, why terrorist acts against civilians? Why aren&#039;t gang members, who supposedly are in the same grouping, committing their crimes against other gang members and not outsiders?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[your initial stat is misleading. of those 40 deaths, how many are criminal on criminal crime? How many go unreported and in a nation of 300+ Million is that really so significant as to impact overall culture? 

there is a difference between killings between criminal elements and those specifically targeting random innocents. (ie terrorism).


and we do know their motivation (boston bombers) they wanted to kill americans (as reported by the escaped hostage from the car jacking as he was told by the bombers that they would not kill him b/c he was NOT american.)


your argument is strongest when it comes to the cold war as the analogy is most apt.  the issue is that it actually undermines your point. it proves that people will kill for ideology or belief system. Communism is akin to religion. In communist country service and belief in the state is in and of itself a religious doctrine. you dont believe in god, you believe in the dictator and the state. thus communism causes one to terrorize. much the same way, a religion that has as one of its tenets of faith of holy war, cause one to terrorize.  targeting of innocents...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A lot of the points you raise are valid, especially about pre-determined conclusions and other sources of motivation for killing/terror. Where you&#039;re mistaken, I believe, is your assertion that in instances where people kill/terrorize in the name of Islam, that the Islam aspect is not the actual source of motivation. &quot;Flawed justification,&quot; you call it. But that&#039;s how you see it, not them. You&#039;re projecting your understanding of their motivations onto them, when they are quite explicit about their motivations. They *are* killing in the name of their faith. (Again, &quot;they&quot; referring to specific people, not an entire group of people.) In some instances, they are being taught that this is what is expected of them because of their religious beliefs. This applies beyond Islam as well. Even if social conditions may be present, radical faith should not be discounted.]]></description>
