		<description><![CDATA[I disagree.  I think the job of kosher agency is to take reasonable precautions to insure the kashruth standards of an establishment at a reasonable price to bring the kosher customer food they can rely upon at a reasonable price.   Sure, you could lock the place down like Fort Knox - but at what cost?  A degree of trust is inseparable from the element &quot;reasonableness&quot; that I think must be met to keep kosher certification a sustainable business model and sustainable means of living as a committed Jew.  

Even a non-Jew who does not have halachic ne&#039;emunus in eidut, is trusted to a degree where he will suffer a large financial loss.  We trust him not to shoot himself in the foot, and lose significant business or incur civil financial penalties.   The whole heter of cholov stam in the US is based on the idea that a non-Jewish owned dairy will not violate the law of the land for fear of civil criminal penalties and loss of reputation.   Shouldn&#039;t the Jewish business proprietor, who may or may not be a yirei shamayim, also have a financial penalty as a deterrent? 

If the previous owner of Doheny was allowed to continue to operate with the RCC supervision (after they corrected their current shortcomings) what motivation would the owner have not to find another opportunity to beat the system?   He must lose his supervision once he is no longer believed to be acting in good faith as a deterrent to him and other would-be cheaters.  

While I agree that a kosher agency should operate AS IF the proprietor were going to hoodwink them, there is no reasonable way forward once you earnestly expect (based on past experience) that the proprietor WILL hoodwink you at any available opportunity.  (He can make up a tale to get a 24/7 locksmith to make him a key to the store/freezer, etc. )  There&#039;s no merit in turning kosher supervision into some sort of game of cat and mouse with an unscrupulous proprietor.

Without a basic trust between two parties that the other will act in good-faith to uphold a contract, no business could ever be conducted.  That&#039;s even if both sides take precautionary measures and exercise due diligence to make sure that all agreements are upheld.  However, once good faith is lost, and one side is shown to be unscrupulous, the smart business person terminates the relationship.  It&#039;s just good sense, and there&#039;s no reason kosher agencies shouldn&#039;t have good sense too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;The reason we need the RCC to supervise is because we don’t trust purveyors of kosher food unless they are supervised.&lt;/i&gt;


No, the reason we need them is because we don&#039;t know which purveyors to trust.  If we know a purveyor personally, and know him to be trustworthy, then we don&#039;t need a hechsher for him.  Back in the day when communities were smaller and we knew all the local purveyors, they didn&#039;t need hechsherim.  The rise of hechsherim came when we began having to deal with people we don&#039;t know; originally hechsherim were not on the food but on the owner, and to an extent some hechsherim still work like that.


Meat, of course, is different, and has for centuries been under hechsher, not because butchers were not trustworthy but because they weren&#039;t talmidei chachomim.   They needed a rov not just to keep them honest, and to certify that they were honest, but also to keep them from making good-faith mistakes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a different between an audit and an investigation. An audit is just trying to make sure things are being done right and assumes everyone has some level of good faith. An investigation assumes a party may not have good faith. It seems to me that even when kashrut rules are somewhat draconian they assume good faith. You assume there is an investigation but consider that there is merely an audit (usually). [This might be why some kashrut agencies stumble when a real problem of good faith arises.] To assume everyone is always dishonest would require an additional level of supervision (every room 24-7) that no one would want to pay for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this is also an issue for whether or not, a proprietor can be afforded a &quot;yotzei venichnas&quot; in lieu of a &quot;mashgiach temidi&quot;.  If someone has lost neemanus they can no longer be &quot;trusted&quot; with a yotzei venichnas.


i would be OK with that...]]></description>
