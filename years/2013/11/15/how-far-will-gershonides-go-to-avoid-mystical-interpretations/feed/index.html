		<description><![CDATA[The big &quot;problem&quot; with the wrestling story is not that, without Ralbag, it appears hard to understand rationally; it&#039;s that is appears to be an obvious example of an etiological commentary, ie, a story told to explain how things came to be. From the name of the River Yabok (from the root of the otherwise strange word &quot;maabak&quot;/wrestle) to the name Peniel, to not eating the sciatic nerve, to the confusion over how the name &quot;Yisrael&quot; came about (because there are two different explanations given, one that it came from the angel, and one that it came from God), to the conflicting reasons for the name &quot;machanayim&quot;, and then at the end of the parsha, the name &quot;alon bachut&quot; - the entire episode has the hallmarks of one big etiology. The widespread and obvious use of etiliology in the Bible is, in my opinion, THE biggest problem thinking orthodox Jews must confront. It is a blessing that 99% of the people go their entire lives without ever picking up on these problems. Like the brothers facing Joseph,or a man trying to find the pickles in the fridge, or the Purloined Letter of Poe, something can be right in front of your face, and yet be practically invisible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks rabbi Fink. just one question... what dose mysticism have to do with Jews living in constant fear? 

on a side note i heard a story of the Arei when he was asleep rab Chaim Vital heard him talking while sleeping, so he went near him to listen but the arei woke up and saw him with his ear at his mouth. reb chaim asked him what he was saying, the arei told him before he goes to sleep he is saying Shaimes trough kabbalah and sends his mind up to learn Torah from the high havens, he then said if he would tell him all his life Torah that he acquired in that one hour of sleep it would be impossible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you might want to look at Corbin&#039;s &#039;alam al-mithal&#039;, the world of myth that is just as real as this world. Dreams have a very wide spectrum, from the confused jumble of daily events to the prophetic, where one consciously interacts with other worlds and entities. It really depends on how open we are to the spiritual. So labelling the experience as a dream in Gersonides terms is not quite what you seem to think it is. And in shamanic terms, as well as, lehavdil, the stories of the Baal Shem Tov, injuries sustained in these realms are instantly transferred to the physical body, which in any case is a projection from the spirit. IMHO.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s hard to have evidence that something &quot;doesn&#039;t exist&quot;, but I understand your question. In short, I see the Torah as being a mix of history and myth whose goal is to impart teachings and instructions to a people. Therefore I don&#039;t classify narratives describing encounters with angels as testimony that angels exist. The same goes for other narratives which describe things or events foreign to normal human experience.



As for the rationalist position which renders Yaakov&#039;s wrestling match as a &quot;vision&quot; and not a live-action narrative event, like I said to R. Fink, I appreciate the idea conceptually but find it to be a less than compelling pshat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The story is evidence that angels exist (i.e. it is a report of an incident involving an angel).  There are numerous first person accounts in Tanach and in the Talmud involving people interacting with angels as well.  This is testimony that angels exist.  I am curious what evidence you think there is that angels don&#039;t exist?


The rationalist position, exemplified by Ralbag and Rambam is that angels are spiritual beings that cannot be seen physically but can only be &quot;seen&quot; mentally in a vision or a dream, and then only by people with refined (trained?) minds.  Hence, Ralbag and Rambam interpret encounters with angels as being parts of visions and not taking place in the physical world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem with the Maimonidean version is that it&#039;s not true to the pshat. The problem with the mystical version is that it&#039;s not true to reality. The story is talking about an actual encounter with an angel. And angels don&#039;t exist (or at least we have no evidence that they do). It seems to me that what we really need today is the intellectual honesty to be able to say both at the same time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Rambam wasn&#039;t a rationalist, He is more a case study in cognitive dissonance, with possibly, messianic complex. If not messianic certainly filled with hubris. But seriously which of his 13 principles of faith are based on rationalism. Those who try and rewrite the metaphysical out of the Torah are doing nothing more than revisionism it fit the Torah into the context of their world views. Everyone wants to cherry pick what they consider magical thinking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Rabbi Fink. Maimonides offers the same explanation on this and other stories involving meeting or seeing angels:
כבר הסברנו שבמקום בו נזכרת ראיית מלאך או פנייה בדיבור מצדו - זה אך ורק במראה הנבואה או בחלום, בין אם זה נאמר מפורשות בין אם לא, כפי שהקדמנו ואמרנו1. דע זאת והבינהו מאוד מאוד! 

....כן אני אומר אף בפרשת יעקב באומרו: ויאבק איש עמו (בראשית ל&quot;ב), שהיתה בצורת התגלות, מכיוון שהתברר לבסוף שהוא מלאך. היא ממש כמו פרשת אברהם, שהקדים בה באופן כולל: וירא אליו ה&#039; וגו&#039; ואחרי-כן החל מסביר כיצד זה היה. כן אמר באשר ליעקב: ויפגעו בו מלאכי אלהים (שם, שם, 16). אחרי-כן החל מסביר מה אירע עד אשר פגעו בו, ואמר שהוא שלח שליחים ופעל ועשׂה, וַיִּוָתֵר יעקב לבדו [ויאבק איש עמו עד עלות השחר] (שם, שם). זה הוא מלאכי אלהים אשר נאמר עליהם בהתחלה: ויפגעו בו מלאכי אלהים. המאבק הזה והפנייה-בדיבור כולם במראה הנבואה (מורה נבוכים ח&quot;ב פמ&quot;ב).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That doesn&#039;t mean that Angels don&#039;t exist.  That means that physical human eyes cannot see Angels (which have no physical manifestation) and therefore anytime Angels are &quot;seen&quot; they are being &quot;seen&quot; in a prophetic vision.  The Rambam held the same way (or at least is commonly cited as holding that way) but clearly holds in the Yad that Angels are actual, spiritual beings.


It is true, however, that Angels are a means through which prophecy is transmitted.]]></description>
