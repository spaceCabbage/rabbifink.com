		<description><![CDATA[Eliyahu,

You are sorely mistaken in your belief of divorce-on-demand, whereas as soon as one spouse wishes to be divorced that he or she is automatically entitled to it.

1) Torah law always allowed a husband to decide he does not want to give a Get to his wife even if she wants one. 2) Rabbeinu Gershom instituted a rabbinic ordinance giving a wife the same right, namely to decide she wishes to decline accepting a Get that her husband wishes to give her.

So it is established, therefore, that either spouse has the right to decide they do not wish to be divorced and rather wish to remain married. The husband has this right by Torah law and the wife has this right by binding rabbinic ordinance. And this right by definition, obviously, means one spouse wishes to divorce while the other spouse wishes to remain married. And in such a case the spouse that wishes to remain married has that right to remain married (either by Torah law or rabbinic ordinance) despite the other spouse wanting to divorce. He has the right to decide he wants to remain married to her even if she wants out. And, similarly, in the reverse Rabbeinu Gershom gave her the right to decline accepting a Get if she doesn&#039;t want to be divorced, even if he does. Rabbeinu Gershom didn&#039;t give her that right merely as an academic exercise. He gave her that right to actually exercise if she decides she wants to remain married to him even if he wants out.

If only one party wishes to divorce, they have no right without the other party consenting to it, as per Rabbeinu Gershom. If one party demands a divorce and the other party wishes to continue remaining married, declining a divorce is both within the letter and the spirit of the law and of Rabbeinu Gershom&#039;s cherem. There is nothing wrong about sincerely exercising your legal rights that are explicitly granted to you for this very reason to exercise. Rabbeinu Gershom specifically gave wives the right to decline to be divorced and to insist on remaining married to her husband. There is no reason she should not exercise this rabbinic right of hers if she sincerely wishes to. And the same vice versa regarding the husband.

If one spouse sincerely wishes to be divorced while the other spouse sincerely wishes that the marriage continue (and there are no severe factors that gives one the halachic right to demand a divorce such as continual physical abuse, refusal of onah or other valid causes that halachicly entitles the other spouse to a divorce), then halacha (per the Torah and per the cherem) allows the spouse who wishes for the marriage to continue, the authority to remain in that marriage even though the other spouse does not wish to remain in the marriage. And Rabbeinu Gershom is explicit in this point with his cherem preventing a husband from divorcing his wife who wishes to remain married to him. He gave wives this same right that the Torah always afforded husbands. My second and third posts above expound this point in greater detail and it would be productive to read them before responding.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sooner or later, we will be back to R. Rackman&#039;s proposal as there has been no better answer within the halachic process for the past 38 years of hand wringing.  By way of tutorial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The solution Rackman proposed was a form of retroactive marital annulment, based on the model of the ‘mistaken sale’ – monetary transactions annulled for lack of full disclosure by one of the parties. Since in marriage, as in sales, full consent is required by both parties, the withholding of information by one is considered to compromise the other’s consent. ‘Concealing an important fact in selling a piece of property can justify the annulment of the sale. The same argument can be applied with regard to a marriage.’” The Talmud recognized the logic of this argument and would have allowed it to be the basis of annulments and saving an &lt;i&gt;aguna&lt;/i&gt;, but disallowed it on another ground: “the general presumption that women prefer any marriage at all to being alone,” even to a leper or an abusive husband.

“Rackman proposed an appropriation of this logic of annulment, with a critical amendment in its application based on an updated presumption about women’s preferences.” Rackman “acknowledged that the mind-set of preferring a bad marriage to no marriage may have been common among Talmudic women” for the woman who was left alone was lost in the society of the times and perhaps even in danger. But, Rackman “concluded simply, ‘In our day it is no longer true.’” A presumption, called &lt;i&gt;hazaka&lt;/i&gt; in Hebrew, is in the Jewish legal system a prediction about nature, in this case, human nature. However, this presumption is outdated and should be ignored and the “mistaken purchase” annulment should stand as the solution to the terrible problem of the “chained wife”.

Unfortunately, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik nixed Rabbi Rackman’s argument in 1975 and thereby, Rabbi Hartman writes, not only harmed the all-to-many chained wives but also placed Judaism in suspended animation. Rabbi Soloveitchik was then and is still today considered an accepted authority on Jewish law among Modern Orthodox Jews. He was, of course, entitled to his opinion, and his view should be respected, but should Judaism follow it when it does so much harm? Aren’t Jews today violating the Torah laws of love and respect of others when they fail to act? Can’t a solution be found that complies with halakha?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[When I see these sad stories, it is a valuable lesson for me to be careful what I wish (pray) for. I was converted by R Feinstein&#039;s primary student, R Aaron Felder, yet the shidduch system has been particularly cruel to me and often left me feeling like damaged goods that no Yeshivish man would want. I know I&#039;m not the only convert who&#039;s been treated this way. I am certainly not comforted by the plight of any agunah, but it reminds me that born Jews who made good matches have their own problems. The current system, in my mind, is not great for many Orthodox people. 
I think there are two other issues that should be addressed here. The first is this idea of dynastic families. No one should have greater pull in a community because of who their father/grandfather/great-grandfather was. Period. Greatness is not genetic, and each individual should be judged on his/her own merits. There are many examples of great self-made men in the United States, and just one or two generations later, the offspring may have the money but they are severely lacking in the vision and ethics of the man who built the wealth. 
The second is the culture within the shidduch system that runs counter to everything Judaism teaches us about men and women. E.g. women are of a higher spiritual nature, women are to be cherished and valued, women are the center of the family, etc. But how would a young man transition to that state of mind when he has just come out of a shidduch system that sends him the message that he is the center of the universe and can have the pick of the litter? Oh, and that&#039;s after his mother has weeded out the ones who aren&#039;t good enough for her son. Infantilizing, indeed. Perhaps a shidduch system that values women will better prepare a man to be a husband who, as the Talmud advises, respects his wife more than himself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; This system must be changed quickly. ... I can go on for hours on the chosson / kallah teacher system and how controlling and manipulating they are, how they don&#039;t educate at all


The control is the point, the system is working perfectly, and so it won&#039;t be changed.


No one deliberately set it up this way, but, like all community institutions, it evolves the best system to perpetuate the community. The best marriage system for perpetuating the yeshivish community is to get people married young and them and their children tied to community institutions as quickly as possible so that they don&#039;t leave the community. It&#039;s not a coincidence that typically the older an unmarried person is, the more modern he gets.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Read yudelstake.blogspot.com Rabbi Yeedle Shain has been covering this story for  a few years now. He has a lot of how the Kotler family&#039;s involvement plays a role and all of that corruption which it comes with. He gets into much more of the nitty gritty on the Weiss&#039;s side. He has met with Gitals brother Aryeh Malkiel who is a big player in this case and he writes alot about that on his site. He also writes about why their arbitrator Rabbi Ronnie Greenwald has left this case. I am very friendly with both families here, and boy is it a mess. I have no opinion on any side and obviously condemn any sort of force such as withholding the get r&quot;l. Thank you for a really great written article , I am married 2 years now, I live in Lakewood, and we always wonder how people get married and just have kids literally 9 months later. My wife can&#039;t relate to the fact that you date 6 times in 3 weeks, get engaged, talk twice a week and then get pregnant. So he never knows you because you&#039;re busy with your pregnancy and being hormonal, and then your busy with the kid and pregnant. This system must be changed quickly. It&#039;s a mess , and the system is controlling, it is insane. I can go on for hours on the chosson / kallah teacher system and how controlling and manipulating they are, how they don&#039;t educate at all,,,but that&#039;s probably for a diff article. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Staten Island Yeshiva, like most sizable yeshivot, likely has donors outside the yeshivish world who would be extremely embarrassed to be associated with Avrohom Meir&#039;s behavior. 



Here&#039;s a recipe that I am proposing:

1. Write an open letter to Rabbi Reuven Feinstein demanding that either Avrohom Meir grants a get or is expelled from the yeshiva.  Get it signed by as many rabbonim as possible.
2. When/If the letter is ignored, get a copy of the yeshiva&#039;s last dinner journal and contact all the major donors.  Let them know what kind of institution they are supporting and ask them to reach out to Rabbi Feinstein.  If that doesn&#039;t work...
3. Let them know there will be a full page ad in the NY Post listing them as supported of this yeshiva with Gital&#039;s story.  If it doesn&#039;t work, follow through with the ad.  


Thoughts?]]></description>
