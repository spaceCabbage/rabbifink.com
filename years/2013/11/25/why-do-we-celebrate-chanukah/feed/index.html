		<description><![CDATA[Eli, PLEASE download a copy of Megilas Taanis from the WEB and correct your post. It very clearly states there that the 8 days are due to the miracle of the oil. You also completely ignore Megilas Atiochus. You also ignore research that explains Macabees 1 was likely written at the time and Macabees 2 written later by people who were not there given the internal inconsistencies within the manuscript. Can you please fix this? Those of us that have done extensive research into the matter of &quot;what if there was no oil&quot; would greatly appreciate if those that come long after us don&#039;t discredit the theory by bad and inaccurate research.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you ever &quot;celebrated&quot; Chanuka?  Did YOU celebrate for only reasons other than its historical context?
What you are saying makes no sense. People celebrate Chanuka for &quot;all of the reasons&quot;. There is no more knowledge of Chanuka&#039;s history today than there was 200 years ago. when we are observing Chanuka today, we are observing it perfectly, with as much knowledge of the historical events as is necessary.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HH,  we KNOW all the &quot;actual historical events&quot; that we need to in order to observe Chanuka fully. If knowing the history and circumstances of the Chanukah period with elaborate detail were important to our observance of Chanukah, you could be sure that all of that history would have been &quot;officially&quot; transmitted in our corpus of volumes.
What was so great about your question, anyway?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That sounds very much like what Farber would say. The Torah is predicated on it&#039;s historical events. If I were to tell you there was no Patriarchs, no Moses, no exodus, the Israelites were really Canaanites, you would still reply that the only thing relevant is Torah and mitzvoth????? Come now Rabbi Fink, you are in Law. I suspect you can smell BS when you hear it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Or Zarua had the third version. The printed version is the fourth version.

You are now positing the existence of a &quot;proto-scholium&quot; from the Tannaitic era. Noam&#039;s research demonstrates that the O and P traditions have no common core, I.e., that there is no proto-scholium. It makes no sense to accept her chiddush that O and P represent independent traditions but then to say that they have a common core. It shows that you don&#039;t understand what she&#039;s saying. 

Basically, all you&#039;ve gotten from Noam&#039;s article is that the oil story is from the time of the Bavli, whereas other traditions are from the era of the Tannaim - that is, 700 years after the events supposedly happened instead of 400 years after the events supposedly happened. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not only Bava Kamma; there are, appropriately, 8 references to Hanukka in the Mishna (more precisely, 7 about the holiday and 1 about the Hasmoneans) and 6 in the Tosefta. It does not seem to have been forgotten. As for the idea of the solstice holiday, the problem is that it&#039;s not the solstice. The middle of Tevet is. Of course, we have a much older tradition for fasting in the middle of Tevet, as well as the middle of Tammuz, the summer solstice.]]></description>

I did some independent research of when the scholia were composed and it seems that there were originally composed in the Tannaic era. That&#039;s not to say that O or P were from that time, rather Megilas Taanis has a very old commentary and there is dispute about what that commentary stated.

		<description><![CDATA[You misunderstood Noam&#039;s work (it&#039;s not simply a case of oversimplification or &quot;frumming it up&quot; for a yeshvish audience). I&#039;m going to parse your paragraph on Noam&#039;s work and point out where you mischaracterize it:

&quot;This may or may not have also been the version of the story according to the scholia (commentary) of Megilas Taanis.&quot;

It makes no sense to  talk of &quot;the&quot; scholium of MT (scholia is plural; scholium is singular). 
Noam has proven that there were 2 independent Palestinian scholia, which she calls the O and P traditions (as distinct from the O and P manuscripts, which merely serve as the best-preserved examples of each  tradition) in addition to the Bavli (she believes that the Bavli redactors had an early version of the P tradition before them, though the redactors of the Bavli introduced a lot of variation). She denies that there was any &quot;proto-scholium&quot; from which all 3 derive. She believes that the 3 extant traditions (P, O, and Bavli) each evolved slowly over the course of the entire rabbinic period. She is also unequivocal that the Bavli story is unique to the Bavli and does not originally appear in the other scholia traditions - there&#039;s no &quot;may or may not&quot; - the O and P scholia did not have that tradition.

&quot;The original scholia was likely written between the writing of Megilas Taanis and the Talmud.&quot;

Once again, there is no &quot;original scholia&quot; or scholium. We have no idea when they were &quot;written down,&quot; as the earliest written versions are from the Cairo Geniza, much later. As noted, Noam also does not think that the O and P scholium traditions reached their final form until around the same time that the Bavli did. This sentence is simply nonsense. 

&quot;A hybrid of two fairly early versions of the scholia seems to have the same story. It’s quoted by the Ohr Zarua (1260) in this manner.&quot; 

Here again, you misunderstand. At some point, manuscripts began combining the O and P scholia (not the Bavli!) into one version. Noam calls this the Hybrid Version, but this was the basis of every printed edition of MT until Noam&#039;s. It is a hybrid of O and P and generally has nothing to do with the Bavli. However, in the particular case of Chanukah, since the Bavli story is so well known, an attempt was made to harmonize the Hybrid Version with the Bavli&#039;s version of the sotry. The Or Zaru&#039;a attempts to harmonize the stories. Later however, and as a result of the Or Zaru&#039;a&#039;s harmonization and the ubiquity of the Bavli story, the miracle of the oil was itself incorporated into later manuscripts of the Hybrid Version. Thus, the printed versions of MT include the Bavli story, even though it could not have entered the Hybrid Version until after the Or Zaru&#039;a&#039;s time, i.e., the 13th century. In other words, the Or Zaru&#039;a is the latest source we have that cites the Hybrid Version WITHOUT viewing the Bavli as part of that version (he cites the Bavli SEPARATELY).

This is how Noam proves that neither the O nor the P traditions (the component parts of the Hybrid Version) originally had the story that appears in the Bavli and in later manuscripts and printed
 editions of Megillat Taanit.

If you&#039;d like, I can email your paragraph to Prof. Noam herself. We can see if she thinks you understood what she&#039;s saying.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You misunderstood Noam&#8217;s work (it&#8217;s not simply a case of oversimplification or &#8220;frumming it up&#8221; for a yeshvish audience). I&#8217;m going to parse your paragraph on Noam&#8217;s work and point out where you mischaracterize it:</p>
<p>&#8220;This may or may not have also been the version of the story according to the scholia (commentary) of Megilas Taanis.&#8221;</p>
<p>It makes no sense to  talk of &#8220;the&#8221; scholium of MT (scholia is plural; scholium is singular).<br />
Noam has proven that there were 2 independent Palestinian scholia, which she calls the O and P traditions (as distinct from the O and P manuscripts, which merely serve as the best-preserved examples of each  tradition) in addition to the Bavli (she believes that the Bavli redactors had an early version of the P tradition before them, though the redactors of the Bavli introduced a lot of variation). She denies that there was any &#8220;proto-scholium&#8221; from which all 3 derive. She believes that the 3 extant traditions (P, O, and Bavli) each evolved slowly over the course of the entire rabbinic period. She is also unequivocal that the Bavli story is unique to the Bavli and does not originally appear in the other scholia traditions &#8211; there&#8217;s no &#8220;may or may not&#8221; &#8211; the O and P scholia did not have that tradition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The original scholia was likely written between the writing of Megilas Taanis and the Talmud.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once again, there is no &#8220;original scholia&#8221; or scholium. We have no idea when they were &#8220;written down,&#8221; as the earliest written versions are from the Cairo Geniza, much later. As noted, Noam also does not think that the O and P scholium traditions reached their final form until around the same time that the Bavli did. This sentence is simply nonsense. </p>
<p>&#8220;A hybrid of two fairly early versions of the scholia seems to have the same story. It’s quoted by the Ohr Zarua (1260) in this manner.&#8221; </p>
<p>Here again, you misunderstand. At some point, manuscripts began combining the O and P scholia (not the Bavli!) into one version. Noam calls this the Hybrid Version, but this was the basis of every printed edition of MT until Noam&#8217;s. It is a hybrid of O and P and generally has nothing to do with the Bavli.

		<description><![CDATA[If we accept Vered Noam&#039;s reading of Megillat Taanit, the earliest explicit source for a miracle of lights is the Babylonian Talmud. And therefore you argue from silence, that not enough people talked about a miracle of lights, so therefore it couldn&#039;t have happened.

The first problem I see with this is the inherent one with arguments from silence. Who knows what you’re missing, that happened not to be written explicitly in the extremely limited sources that survive to this day?

The second problem is that earlier sources DO mention features that fit the oil-miracle explanation better than any other that you mention, such as the 8-day duration of the holiday, or the name “Lights” (well known to Josephus, but for which his non-miraculous explanation [which you quote above] is incredibly weak). (Other theories, like a relation to Sukkot or to the olive harvest, might be stronger but you didn’t bring them up.) 

The third problem is with your discomfort with the possibility of this miracle occurring at this time. According to both Tanach nd rabbinic tradition, miracles similar to this one happened all the time in the Temple, particularly at its inaugurations, despite being &quot;completely unnecessary&quot;! You say Chanukah is different because it’s after Purim and therefore must fit the Purim model of not having miracles. Is that true? One could argue instead that the Purim model is appropriate for exile (hester panim), but at
Chanukah, when Jews gained sovereignty for the first time since Hezekiah, perhaps the kind of miracles that happened at key moments in the First Temple period are to be expected.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the idea found in the Chida, the Eishel Avraham&#039;s intro to Megillas Taanis and the Gra as for why there is no mishnah addressing the laws of Chanukah. (Although it is assumed and comes up in a number of places, so we know Rebbe considered Chanukah a holiday with a specific Torah reading in which enough people lit something near their doorway that the person whose merchandise got burned by a Chanukah menorah is considered personally negligent and can&#039;t sue for reimbersement.) They say that because it was already well documented in the appendix to Megillas Taanis, there was no need for a mishnah; and as you note -- without need, there is no permissibility either. (Although why we assume this rule applies to rabbinic law rather than only interpretations of the original Oral Torah is beyond me. Also, the Gra&#039;s son says his father speaks of &quot;Mesechtes Chanukah&quot; which I am only assuming is the appendix.)

But given that this idea appeals to me, I have no room for your notion of forgetfulness.


Rather, I would assume it was a conscious attempt to change the theme of the holiday. We have no holidays set up to commemorate private miracles. And how many people could have seen the miracle of the oil? The subset of kohanim who were tahor and working in the Heikhal that week so frequently that they can attest that no one refilled and re-lit the menorah while they were elsewhere. So I think it makes sense to take the apocryphal books and the author of Al haNisim at face value and say the holiday was at that time about the restoration of some level of political autonomy and of Temple worship for the next two centuries.

And then we lost it all. No autonomy, the majority of the community of the land of Israel forced to join their brothers in exile, no Temple. Notice it&#039;s the *Babylonian* Talmud that is asking this question! The Talmud isn&#039;t asking &quot;What is Chanukah?&quot; in the abstract, it is asking pragmatically. The laws are on the books and they weren&#039;t empowered to repeal a law enacted by a Sanhedrin in the Chamber of Hewn Stone in the Temple. But the meaning was gone; rather than being a celebration, it became a reminder of everything lost. And so the amora&#039;im set out to reassign meaning to the mitzvos of the holiday by emphasizing a miracle than until then was a tangential thing -- but at least related to the central mitzvah of the holiday, lighting the menorah. And so it is very much a festival of light, reinvented as such in the darkness of exile.]]></description>
