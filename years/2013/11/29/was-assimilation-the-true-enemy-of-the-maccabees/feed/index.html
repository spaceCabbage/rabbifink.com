		<description><![CDATA[Correct me if I am wrong, but I was under the impression that, according to the book of Maccabees, the Greeks did not restrict religious practice until Hellenized Jews requested such decrees. I have also heard that Hellenized Jews made up the majority of the &quot;Greek&quot; army in the war, although I can&#039;t remember the source for that. If either of those are true, it seems like a stretch to say that the assimilated were apathetic to the goals of the revolution, or that they played at most a secondary role.]]></description>
