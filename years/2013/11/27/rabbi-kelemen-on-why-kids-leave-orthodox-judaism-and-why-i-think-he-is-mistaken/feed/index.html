		<description><![CDATA[Wow that was quite intense. It seems to me that you&#039;re opinion is very blinded, narrow minded, and black and white. To make a general statement about a large group of people is prejudice and is usually a symptom of being lost in your head and your thoughts.


What would be more honest and real would be to share your experience with Judaism and adding on that you see it that way with many people and in many places. But to believe that this is everybody&#039;s experience and that they don&#039;t feel anything meaningful is a very narrow and close minded approach.


There is no question that 2 people can hear how something must be done and 1 of them feels condemned while the other just moves on and takes it in stride and in context. Additionally not every community speaks and teaches about the things you mentioned. Different communities place the emphasis on different things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Many orthodox Jews wonder why all the Jews in the world don&#039;t become religious. Its because they can&#039;t! Not at the standards orthodoxy holds. I grew up in a secular house and spent thousands of hours of my adult life studying orthodoxy till I came to the conclusion it is insane. Rituals for this, rituals for that, wash your hands before touching bread or you&#039;re a Rasha! Don&#039;t burn your nails and you&#039;re a Rasha. Don&#039;t forget to pray after the bathroom or an angel will be created that will testify against you. Ridiculous beleifs in angels and demons and spirts (I thought Judaism was monotheism but there is way to much dualism that I encountered studying orthodoxy). Ridiculous beliefs that touching a women on her period makes you impure. Making women feel like dirt because there elbows aren&#039;t covered half an inch more (they are going to gehonnom because of it). Thinking women who wear pants in their house are loose. Thinking that you can live in the world without working and just studying Torah all day(has it ever crossed their minds that people leave Judaism for financial reasons? HELLO). No individuality and lack of empathy, hate fostered more in my heart as I studied more orthodoxy and couldn&#039;t even look at a women in the target checkout lane without thinking some nonsense that i&#039;ll lose my eyesight young because of it. Truth is I feel like there was some error in the oral Torah and all these Chumrot and adding to the Torah everyday. Even when all the Jews in the world were religious there were still pogroms against us, . I love Hashem very much and am grateful for every moment. I just can&#039;t live a ritualized life where I have to feel bad about everything I do. I wonder if orthodox jews honestly feel a connection to Hashem as they pray the same prayer 600000 times or just feel guilty. It is Hashem who makes you pure or impure not jumping in rain water and saying the same bracha 10 times a day! Judaism went wrong somewhere and I believe we will return to the true derech once Mosiach comes, but the Judaism we have today is narcissistic, OCD and involves shaming and really is not far off from Christianity in terms of dualism. I will put my faith in Hashem alone, not the power of stupid beliefs about cutting nails, angels, demons, and other superstitions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Objectively, I think the reason many people leave Judaism is the same as the reasons people leave other religions.

Up to a hundred or so years ago, you HAD TO be affiliated with one religion or another, there was no such thing as secularism. And up to a few hundred years ago, you had to be strongly affiliated, if you didn&#039;t meet your religious obligations (whether it be attendance at services, tithing, or the generally required lip service), you were shunned (and you were shunned by everyone in your community, because there were no &quot;separatists&quot; from religion).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;If parents are good parents for 5 kids and the sixth kid goes OTD, does that mean they somehow screwed up parenting that one kid?&quot;

Perhaps it&#039;s not an issue of being a &quot;bad parent&quot;, so much as not being a perfect &quot;shidduch&quot; for the child, or key for the lock. In other words, parenting has an important effect as an OTD factor, according to this view,  but it&#039;s incorrect to blame parents for being imperfect. There could be multiple factors simultaneously, including the level of the child&#039;s  free will. The focus should indeed not be on hindsight, but on prevention.  אל תדין את חברך עד שתגיע למקומו-- regarding both children and their parents.

 From  Rabbi Kelemen&#039;s JA letter:

 &quot;Rabbi Dr. Benzion Sorotzkin, a clinical psychologist with more than thirty years’ experience in the Orthodox community and author of The Role of Parents, wrote to me regarding the argument that it can’t be deficiencies in parenting that cause children to go off the derech when there are other siblings who are “perfectly frum and ehrlich”:

If a car with four passengers was involved in an accident, one passenger was killed and the three others escaped injury, would this prove that it wasn’t the accident that killed the driver? In addition, our assumption that the other siblings [of an off-the-derech child] are doing fine can often be very inaccurate. I have often had lengthy discussions with highly functioning siblings of off-the-derech youth. They often point to significant issues in the family that contributed to the development of the problems of their wayward sibling (e.g., shalom bayis issues, overly critical parents, et cetera). I always make it a point to ask them how they managed to avoid being damaged by these family issues. The most frequent response is that they were impacted, just not in the obvious manner that is displayed by their wayward sibling&quot;

----------

From a section titled &quot;Why only one sibling?&quot; in   &quot;The Role of Parents in the Current Crisis of Rebellious Adolescents: Dare We Discuss It? Can We Afford Not To?&quot;(available on Dr. Sorotzkin&#039;s website):

&quot;The most common &quot;evidence&quot; cited to prove that parenting practices are not significant factors in causing adolescents to rebel, is that often only one of many siblings rebels. As one mechanech challenged me, &quot;If the parents were cold and distant how did they manage to succeed with their other children?&quot;

The assumption that parents succeeded with their other children is often based on superficial criteria, for example, the fact that the other children didn&#039;t rebel against yidishkeit. Often however, the other children have also been hurt, but in less obvious ways. Perhaps the other children lack self-confidence or suffer from low self-esteem. Sometimes some of the other children are quite depressed, but not to the point that it is obvious to other people. Even more misleading is when some of the other children become highly functioning perfectionists as a guilt-ridden reaction to constant criticism. What is clear is that one should not assume that the other children were not hurt based on superficial impressions. No one ever claimed that errors in parenting have to result in children going off the derech. It is only one of many possible negative consequences.

Even if it were clear that, in a particular case, the parents were successful in raising their other children, what relevance would that have to the parents&#039; impact on one particular child&#039;s life? There are cases of undisputed, serious parental abuse where some of the children seem to have survived without major psychological damage. Does that prove that the problems that the other children suffer from were not caused by the abuse? If four people are in a car accident, and one passenger gets hurt while the other three escape unscratched, does that prove that it couldn&#039;t have been the accident that caused the injury?

Parents never treat all their children identically (e.g., boys vs. girls, youngest vs. oldest, etc.) and there can be other external factors unique to one of the siblings (as noted above from Alice Miller) that may make him more immune to the negative impact of parental maltreatment. Likewise, parents sometimes learn from their mistakes with one of their children and therefore are more successful with other children. Based on informal surveys that I have conducted, for example, it seems that the vast majority of parents are significantly less strict with their later children than they were with their oldest children since they learn from experience that being overly rigid and strict is counterproductive. In such a situation, perhaps only the older child would develop a serious problem.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Huh? That wasn&#039;t the point that I read. You were arguing that people do not give up religious observance based intellectual factors alone. That is simply untrue.


In any case just because I still live for pragmatic family reasons in a religious neighborhood doesn&#039;t mean that I am in any active way part of the &#039;Orthodox Religious Community&quot;. I just avoid bringing attention to the fact that I am no longer religious. I do not keep Shabbat. I do not limit myself to eating only kosher food. I sometimes pop into shul to see friends. I have stopped being religious simply due to the fact that I have concluded intellectually that judaism and god are main-made concepts and don&#039;t reflect any true reality. I avoid publicly doing things that are unacceptable in a religious culture simply due to their potential re-percussions on my family at this stage in life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Trauma can also occur without any parent, teacher, or peer actively hurting the person.  Struggling with mental illness, learning disabilities, any situation where the person feels separate from, or marginalized by, the community; it&#039;s traumatic.  It hurts.

That has nothing to do with parenting, per se.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Debra, I don&#039;t understand how you equate rational with obvious truth. 


Secondly, many people reach conclusions based on things other than rationality. Some people are swayed by emotions and feelings more than rational thought. When peoples conclusions are swayed by such factors, then it can be called subjective but then those conclusions are no longer rational. There&#039;s a reason why religious faith contains the word faith.


For the limits of rationalism within the framework of Orthodox Jewish thought have a look at the following posting by Rabbi Natan Slifkin:

		<description><![CDATA[The argument that &quot;bad&quot; parenting causes OTD is belied by the fact that in many families, only one child of many goes OTD.  Those looking to prop up the &quot;trauma&quot; argument will try to find evidence that that one child was secretly abused or had some other &quot;trauma&quot;, but that&#039;s not always the case.  If parents are good parents for 5 kids and the sixth kid goes OTD, does that mean they somehow screwed up parenting that one kid?  How could they have known that the methods which worked fine for 5 wouldn&#039;t work for #6?  



As I said above, the whole &quot;trauma&quot; theory is bull$hit.  Everyone has trauma, or at least drama, in their lives. Plenty of people who remain within the fold, as true believers, have suffered horrible traumas.  Plenty of people who leave have suffered minimal or negligible trauma.  The idea of trying to pin OTD, &lt;b&gt;in hindsight&lt;/b&gt;, on trauma is the worse use of the sharpshooter&#039;s fallacy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Do we consider all baalei teshuva to result from bad parenting or trauma?&lt;/i&gt;


No.  BT isn&#039;t a rejection of the parent&#039;s core beliefs.  In fact, if the nonfrum Jewish parents have a positive Jewish identity, and pass that to their children, a child becoming BT is simply carrying that message to its logical conclusion.


My grandfather told me how proud he was that I had become BT - even though he was a completely secular Jew.  He cared about the Jewish people, saw that so many Jews were not bringing up Jewish families, and realized that my observance was a confirmation, not a rejection, of the positive Jewish identity that I had been raised with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is  the dispute on the Cross Currents thread(&quot;People With Questions Are Not Sick&quot;, 4/17/11) from R Adlerstein:

&quot;Rabbi Yerachmiel Milstein is one of the most talented people on the kiruv scene. If he says what he is quoted as saying, I will believe him.

Emotional problems are behind almost all kefra. “In addition to many other things, to stop believing is inconvenient.” Immersed in a religious world, they are suddenly cut off from their entire milieu. “Why would they do it if they didn’t have some emotional issues?”

Why? Because some people have enough intellectual integrity to live by what their minds tell them, even if it is inconvenient. Isn’t that what we Torah-true Jews often have to do? Is it impossible to believe that others do the same? Perhaps Rabbi Milstein hasn’t met them. I have.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Actually no. Some, once realizing that (to their understanding) Judaism is false, has some things they are uncomfortable with. Perhaps they don&#039;t want to be identified with a religion that represents ideas they don&#039;t hold. My impression is that, fakhert, orthoprax people are usually already married with children before they realized that they don&#039;t think Judaism is true. So yes, breaking up a family and leaving it prevents them from abandoning Judaism. However, a single person who thinks Judaism is not true is not to be expected to marry someone (who likely believes and that is very problematic) and raise their children in a falsehood. One doesn&#039;t need a trauma or bad parenting to decide that. There is also the basic urge for people to live true to themselves. Again, no need for bad parenting or trauma, to have someone decide to live according to their beliefs. Do we consider all baalei teshuva to result from bad parenting or trauma?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A thought,


That is exactly my point.


People who have ONLY intellectual concerns don&#039;t leave.  They stay in observant communities, they marry observant spouses, and they raise observant children.


If they did not experience any trauma, they are content to remain outwardly observant, and give their children the same upbringing that they themselves had.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What event could cause a born and raised observant Jew to become a devout Atheist?


Desire for a rational life?  From Rambam to Rav Slifkin, there are rationalists who maintain observance.


Desire to work in a certain profession?  Again, there are frum Jews in basically every profession?


Desire to live a modern lifestyle?  Plenty of observant Jews living in big cities (not ghettos), going to the theater, involved in politics, etc.


 What catalyst could there be to cause such a huge shift in perspective?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Living according to halacha is not synonymous with believing in Gd.


We are talking about Jews who have learned through years of schooling and socialization, to live according to halacha.


Doubt about Gd alone isn&#039;t enough of a motive to abandon a lifetime of halachic observance, sever ties with families, traditions, ones entire social and cultural norm.


A break that big can only be precipitated by some kind of trauma.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your original question was, did it ever occur to observant Jews, that not all Jews will be observant.


I answered that it didn&#039;t, nor should it, since all Jews are obligated to the Law.


You don&#039;t seem to dispute that; you&#039;re just saying that practically, we can&#039;t expect everyone to follow the Law to which they are obligated.


Why not?


Why can&#039;t every Jew find a home somewhere between YCT and Satmar? 


The only reason they couldn&#039;t, is if they have some emotional scarring from parent, teacher, or peer, that prevents them from finding their niche in shmirat hamitzvot.


You know as well as I do that observant Jews are found in the medical, legal, academic, and scientific worlds.  A person can love rationality and science and still accept Matan Torah.


That&#039;s why so many leaders in the observant Jewish world point to emotional trauma as the main cause of &quot;leaving the fold&quot;.  Logically, it&#039;s the most consistent explanation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[G*3, 

I was responding to specific statements in Rabbi Fink&#039;s post.

Rabbi Fink (to the best of my knowledge) knows and understands that the Creator of the Universe gave the Written Torah and Oral Torah on Mount Sinai, to the people of Israel.

One who knows and understands that the giving of the Torah happened, also knows that the Torah is obligatory on all Jews.  (deaf-mutes, mentally ill people, and those who were deprived of a Torah education may be exempt from punishment in certain cases, but are still obligated to the Law)

Under those parameters - the parameters under which Rabbi Fink operates - it is correct to understand that the Creator of Everything gave one Law that applies to all of the People of Israel.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Modern society is more fair and just. In the modern world, your rights cannot be abridged.  There are no punishments for “wrong” thinking.  There is no “wrong” thinking actually.  Your obligation is not to abridge the rights of others.

The modern world does not have a category of “heretic,” or a person who loses status, respectability, and rights in this world and suffers in the next due to having the “wrong” belief and/or practice.

So, religions like Judaism, Islam and Christianity are inherently unjust.  In Xtianity, believe as we say or burn for eternity in a lake of fire.   In Judaism, believe as we say or lose your place in the world to come (or, reading Deuteronomy or Leviticus, much worse.)  In Islam, even more strongly worded penalties for those who don’t submit.

This is not just.  Even if I were the strongest believer in Torah Mt. Sinai – I would know, in my head and my heart, that whoever wrote this book was not being just to those who didn’t believe like me.  Because their only crime was --  they happen not to be me.  And nobody deserves punishment for that reason alone.  And that is the divine lesson of the enlightened world for all people everywhere.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In “Kids of Hope”(Hamodia Supplement, Peasch 5770, pg 7, available online)the Noverminsker Rebbe is quoted that “there’s no one single cause that we can point to; obviously many factors are involved”.

 Dr. Benzion Sorotzkin writes in “The Role of Parents in The Current Crisis of ‘Off the Derech’ Adolescents: Dare We Discuss it? Can We Afford Not To ?”(pg 139, available on his website;R. Keleman references the article in his JA letter),

“…Rabbi Matisyohu Salomon has been quoted (from a Tisha B’Av speech) as describing the current epidemic of rebellious youngsters as “a gezeira of golus.” This has been interpreted by some as suggesting that this tragedy can happen to anyone without natural reasons of cause and effect. Recently, I had an opportunity to ask Rabbi Salomon about his statement. He explained that he did not mean that this tragedy strikes at random, without rhyme or reason. Rather, he meant that the conditions that bring about this problem – and he emphasized the quality of the parent-child relationship as a major factor – are the result of the geziera of golus (e.g., the absence of the Beis Hamikdash).”

Regarding the need for data, Jonathan Rosenblum wrote in “More Information, Please”(January, 2008),

“The truth is that we have relatively little hard empirical data about the drop-out phenomenon. Most of what we know is based on anecdotal experience from which we extrapolate wildly. Each person in the field comes at it from his own vantage point. Thus those who work in the area of learning disabilities tend to see learning disabilities as the primary cause for dropping-out…Others will tell you that the problem is poverty, or, in America, affluence. Those who deal with sexual abuse see that as a major cause…My own guess is that virtually everyone is right — to a degree…Certainly no one explanation fits every case.”

My own take regarding the similar issue of  &quot;Adults at Risk&quot;(discussed, for example in  “People With Questions Are Not Sick”, Cross Currents, 4/17/11, in response to AMI Magazine’s “The Imposters Among Us”),  is similar to the above.  Instead of trying to find the single  ultimate and universal cause, in absence of a Pew study for internal Orthodox matters, why not leave it at the observation that a person is made of mind, body, and soul, all of which play a role in different people, differently, and simultaneously?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Living a life consistent with halacha IS for all Jews, and it is correct to expect that EVERY Jew can live such a life.

Who is entitled to expect it? You? God? Is it reasonable to expect Jews who don’t believe that God gave the Torah to keep halacha?

Also, how do you define “halacha?” Other movements have their versions of halacha. Are those legitimate, or only Orthodox halacha? If only Orthodox, then who gets to define normative halacha?

		<description><![CDATA[I actually came to a similar conclusion to Keleman on my own over the years. But I don&#039;t think you are entirely disagreeing with him. Sure, kids have their own reasons, but as you said &quot;...we are likely sealing their fate.&quot; 


So it really does come down to the parents or the household at the end of the day (depending on the age of the child). They pretty much seal the deal with how they manage and deal with their children&#039;s feelings towards Orthodoxy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Rabbi Fink,

I read your take on Rabbi Kelemen&#039;s article on why kids leave orthodox Judaism. I hold this issue dear to me and just want to comment that family is a huge factor that cannot be discounted. With many people I&#039;ve seen go &quot;off the derech,&quot; in some cases a family that outwardly looked healthy turned rotten in the inside, resulting in divorce. That can easily emotionally scar someone to see everything - including religion - as superficial.

Another example has to do with bad parenting and step-parenting. Step-parents are unique in that the child of the spouse that remarries is not theirs, but is to a degree. Step-parents I find can go in one of two extremes: either they overcompensate with love or they show particular disgust to the child that isn&#039;t biologically theirs. It&#039;s an unfortunate phenomenon.

Also, I want to point out that simply put, bad parents may be bad parents as a result their own pasts. At the risk of launching a whole other discussion, one case in point is with many children of parents that survived the horrors of the Holocaust. Many parents of that era had a difficult enough time readjusting to their own lives (no fault can be placed there), but the unfortunate result was that many of their children were impacted on a subconscious level, leading to their desire to assimilate into American culture and leave any remnants of their past behind.

Lastly, in a lot of cases bad parents may be that way simply because they are bad parents. For example, the way a parent deals with child when that child fails a test in school, gets sent to the Principal&#039;s office, or in a more extreme case gets arrested will have a lasting impact on how that child develops later on in life.

These are just some examples. I think that the real underlying issue is that parents fail to transmit the intense love and warmth that a Torah-observant way of life offers. Most people - not just children - want to be loved. And if they don&#039;t feel they will get it from Torah Judaism then they will find other outlets to fill that void.

Just my 2c.]]></description>
