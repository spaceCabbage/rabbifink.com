		<description><![CDATA[I fully remember this coming out.  I think it made some Israeli news websites.  If you go on youtube, you can see a video about it.

I was surprised it was so ignored – perhaps it is all bull.

I believe the news story says that moshiach will come upon the passing of Ariel Sharon (G-d forbid.)

The other story that is a recent one that was entirely ignored:

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/science/ashkenazi-origins-may-be-with-european-women-study-finds.html?_r=0

If this is true – it does seem that (perhaps) up to eighty percent of Ashkenazi Jews are the spawn of Jewish men who converted gentile women for the purpose of marriage.

So it seems that the rabbaim should “lighten up” on gentiles converting for marriage – or acknowledge that eighty percent of Ashkenazim today are not even Jewish!  

More interesting to me is that the story was totally ignored by the blogosphere.  Too painful a potential problem?  Perhaps better to bury these kinds of articles.]]></description>
