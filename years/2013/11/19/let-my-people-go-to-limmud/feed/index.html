		<description><![CDATA[Israel is not a good comparison to the United States.  (1) The Chareidi control of a lot of state affairs has been a turn off too many from any form of Orthodoxy.  (2) In only the Jewish state there is the belief that just by virtue of living there, your kids will identify as Jews -  without any effort to at all to affiliate, practice, educate, etc. required.   It makes Israel a unique situation where people abandoned all observance that may not be comparable to diaspora circumstances.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A good example to look at is Israel. A lot of the Jews there are secular, since Orthodoxy doesn&#039;t work for them, and many of them believe it&#039;s Orthodox or nothing. Now that the more progressive movements are starting to gain traction there, more previously secular Israelis are starting to get involved in non-Orthodox synagogue life, plus there is now a revival in &quot;secular&quot; Talmud study, a &quot;secular yeshiva&quot; movement, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One additional thought on what you wrote: &quot;They are Jewish and religious in their own way thanks to Reform, Conservative, and the rest of them.&quot;   As I previously posted, over at Cross Currents they will tell you that the existence of the other movements weakened Jewry further, not the other way around.

What I am asking now is - Are they right?   Watch the video linked below from &quot;The Shabbos Project&quot; in South Africa - where there is not much of an organized Jewish religious presence outside of Orthodoxy.  Recently in South Africa tons of Jews across the county, who normally don&#039;t keep Shabbat, kept a halachic Shabbat.   Could that happen in the US? 

 Are Jews in parts of the world, where other movements never took hold, generally more traditionally minded?  Without other options that validate a religious lifestyle that&#039;s not halachic, are people who seek religion/spirituality more likely to make the effort to become orthodoxly observant?  If the answers are yes, and consider that they might be, then the other movements haven&#039;t really helped by creating a comfort zone outside of Orthodox observance- have they? 

Video link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOUGRnGkCM&amp;noredirect=1


P.S. I&#039;m not making a statement one way or the other here.  Just providing food for thought.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nicely stated, R Fink. About a week and a half ago I attended my first planning meeting for Limmud Chicago. I have been playing with the idea of getting involved (and presenting) for five years. I was one of two out of twenty-five that were outwardly Orthodox and was made to feel very welcome (and the location of be meeting also hosts drum circles). For me it boils down to the fact that I will have an opportunity to give over something from our mesorah. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a thought: Not only might the Orthodox people who participate in Limmud help to inspire people who are not Orthodox, the Orthodox might also be inspired by, and learn some things from, those who are not Orthodox - without losing their firm grasp on their own Orthodoxy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice article.  But, you&#039;re probably preaching to the choir on your blog here.  Over at Cross-Currents they probably see things a little differently.

For example:
(1) Your wrote &quot;Non-Orthodox Judaism has kept many of our brothers and sisters in the fold.&quot;  They would say that&#039;s an oxymoron; by definition non-Orthodox is out of the fold. 
(2) Your wrote &quot;They are Jewish and religious in their own way thanks to Reform, Conservative, and the rest of them.&quot;  They believe that if it weren&#039;t for organized religion outside of Orthodoxy, more Jews would have stayed Orthodoxly observant.  They fault the other movements for the attrition from Orthodoxy in the early to mid 20th century.

They might be receptive to seeing Limmud as a kiruv opportunity through people like Rabbi Alderstein.   However, an MO rabbi has no chance of getting them to see the other movements as anything other than the enemy... the canyon between chareidim and anyone else is growing to vast.]]></description>
