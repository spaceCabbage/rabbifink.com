I think this provides much needed context to the allegations. I am not sure it fully satisfies the complaints.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wish I had the time to answer it all, I don&#039;t. But it is all answerable.

Here&#039;s my small contribution. 

the author writes:
&quot;We learned that Palestinian students of all ages endure harassment at military checkpoints, frequent school closures, unprovoked arrests, imprisonment and sometimes death at the hands of trigger-happy soldiers&quot;

This is a list of propaganda slogans, used over and over, as part of &quot;the big lie&quot; strategy. Repeat things enough times and they will take hold in peoples mind as being true. 

1) &quot;Harassment at military checkpoints&quot;
In every military - every society - there are horrible acts committed by members of the society. 
The measure of the society, is how it responds. 
Are the acts rebuked and punished severely or are they lauded, encouraged and financially rewarded.
The Palestinian Authority (P.A.) has thousands of people on its payroll. From civil servants to policemen. Do you know who gets the highest pay grade in the P.A. ?
Those sitting in Israeli prisons, arrested for acts of terror. Of those sitting in prison, who get the highest of the highest pay grade ?  Anyone who murdered an Israeli !

A society where suicide bombers are rewarded &#038; publicly honored by the authorities cannot expect its potential victims to invite them to a friendly chat over beer.

Yes, military checkpoints are no fun. But, they are a necessary evil, implemented to safeguard Israel from terrorists entering the Jewish areas. In the past, Israel has temporarily removed checkpoints thereby easing the life of the Palestinian Arabs. This was always done as a &quot;faith building&quot; step requested by the PA and backed by the US. In the overwhelming majority of those cases, when the military checkpoints were removed, a terrorist attack occurred within days.

Also, the checkpoints are under surveillance by left wing Israeli groups like &quot;machsom watch&quot;. They have volunteers who sit there with video cameras trying to &quot;catch&quot; any soldier who takes part in harassment or violence. They report these cases to the IDF and the soldiers are tried and punished.

I myself have witnessed Arab teenagers taunting Israeli soldiers trying to get them to react with violence. This includes physical attacks -  throwing stones and glass bottles at the soldiers. Usually, the soldiers don&#039;t react. They are not allowed to. Their orders are to retreat !
At times they do lose it. When that happens they stand trial and are punished. 

Here&#039;s a current example: 
Just last week Colonel Shalom Eisner of the IDF was forced to pay the price of forcefully pushing a protestor with his rifle.
Eisner devoted his entire life to the IDF. He was slated to rise to the highest positions in the army.
He was provoked by a demonstrator and &quot;lost it&quot;. Eisner was court martial&#039;ed and will have to leave the army after his current tour of duty ends. His years of service - of bravery defending the Jewish people  - didn&#039;t help.
He was forced to end his military career, not for killing, not for injuring, for violently pushing a protestor.

2) &quot;death at the hands of trigger-happy soldiers&quot;  
I challenge the author to find a case where a Palestinian Arab was shot for no reason, &quot;just because&quot; some Israeli soldier was trigger happy and the soldier is not in prison.
In fact the IDF has extremely strict rules about when a soldier is allowed to open fire. It is ONLY when there is a clear threat to his life. I know of many soldiers who complain that they are scared to open fire even though they do feel threatened because they fear trial and imprisonment.
This is an unadulterated lie.

The bottom line is things must be placed in context.

There are two sides in the conflict. 
Only one side wants &#038; works toward the goal of the other side disappearing.

If the Arabs put down their weapons today, there would be no more violence. 
If the Jews put down their weapons today, there would be no more Israel.]]></description>
