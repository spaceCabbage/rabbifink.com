		<description><![CDATA[There are may things taught in schools around the globe as FACTS in the Torah, while in reality they are actually taken from the &quot;little / medrash says&quot;. I have often questioned what is written there, as it is the opposite of what written in the chumash, but it just gives a vague reference to a medrash, and the medrash itself just says 1 word about a whole story that the &quot;Medrash Says&quot; has expounded on. These books seem to have been accepted - especially with schools but often is certainly not poshut pshat in the parsha, and is taught as if its Halocho l&#039;Moshe Misinai.
Thank you Rabbi Fink for exposing this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, they are. Especially the &quot;wars of the Chidren of Yaakov,&quot; which read like a superhero comic book. (I recently tried to convince a friend in the publishing business, who is also into comic books, to publish a series based on them, but I doubt he will.)


Interestingly, though. these &quot;heroics&quot; can be found in Yalkut Shimoni too, so they likely did have a real Midrashic source. (Which was also most likely Ramban&#039;s source when he refers to them, not Sefer HaYashar, which Chida thought was his source.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am also puzzled why Sefer HaYashar is as accepted at face value as it is, but the bottom line is that it has been accepted by mainstream Chareidi Jewry.

Besides The Midrash Says (and Liitle Midrash Says), it is widely quoted by Me&#039;am Lo&#039;ez, and in just about every post- Seder Olam sefer that uses chronology. There is one edition that includes notes from Rav Chaim Kanievsky (from when he was quite young), where he says that we can be confident that what is contained within is based on lost Midrashim.

In my experience, the author embellished known Midrashim, such as &quot;fleshing out&quot; how Serach broke the news to Yaakov. Other examples include B&#039;reishis Rabbah making an obscure reference to Avraham making multiple trips between Charan and Canaan and Sefer HaYashar, using the Seder Olam&#039;s &quot;Avraham was 70 by the B&#039;ros bein HaB&#039;sarim,&quot; telling us that his first trip eas when he was 55, returning when he was 70, and finally moking to Canaan when he was 75,  and&quot;real&quot; Midrashimim saying there were 4 groups by the Red Sea (each wanting to deal with being cornered by the Egyptians in a different way), and Sefer HaYashar tells us which Tribes were in each group.]]></description>
