		<description><![CDATA[As is often the case with people who are politically and/or theologically conservative, you seem not to understand the meaning of the word &quot;fact&quot;.


Also, as evidenced by your screen name, you have no sense of irony (another problem endemic to evangelicals and the right wing frum).]]></description>

Lots of people say a lot of things (usually contradictory) but what did he act on?
His legacy will live on long after he is gone - but so does the legacy of ghengis kahn!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This post was put on the Jewish Press website, and drew quite a bit of negative comments. You can dig in your heels if you wish, but honestly compels you, I think, to reconsider your words about Mandela, and to state as much. It&#039;s no shame not to have known these things, the general media have been just as corrupt in hiding these inconvenient truths as they have vis-à-vis Obama. Again, I recognize nothing is every completely one sided, but Mandela was under no circumstances a great man, and very much deserved the life sentence he was given before South Africa bowed to pressure and released him [and thereby pressing the self-destruct button.]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here are some of my favorite Nelson Mandela quotes:

* &quot;Those who are irritated by our friendship with Brother Leader Qaddafi can jump in a pool.&quot;

* &quot;It is our duty to give support to the Brother Leader [Qaddafi]... especially in regards to [opposing] the sanctions [against Libya].&quot;

* I shall therefore take the liberty to invite our guests to rise and raise their glasses with me in salute to Muamar Qaddafi, our Brother Leader of the Revolution of the Libyan Jamahariya.&quot;

* &quot;Yasser Arafat [is] our friend and comrade... like us, fighting against a unique form of colonialism...  If the truth alienates the Jewish community in South Africa, too bad.&quot;

* &quot;From its earliest days, the Cuban Revolution has also been a source of inspiration to all freedom-loving people...  Long live the Cuban Revolution.  Long live comrade Fidel Castro.&quot;

* &quot;If you look at those matters, you will come to the conclusion that the attitude of the United States of America is a threat to world peace.&quot;

* &quot;If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world, it is the United States of America.  They don’t care for human beings.&quot;

* One of my very favorite Mandela quotes of all is the one in which he called for punishing people who failed to participate in strikes called by the ANC by apprehending them and &quot;cutting their noses off&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pretty surprised you&#039;ve fallen into lockstep with the political correct (read: rootless)  world we live in. Even as a kid in Canada, I knew Nelson Mandela used to kill people he disagreed with by necklacing. (Look it up if you don&#039;t know.) Is one supposed to celebrate a man responsible for turning one of the most beautiful and successful countries on Earth into a hell-hole, with no economy except the teetering infrastructure still remaining that other people built? A country whose blacks are now engaged in worse forms of discrimination against whites, than its whites ever engaged in against blacks? This is someone you look up to? {And before some fool shouts what about Begin the terrorist, look at the facts more closely, the distinctions are obvious and many.] 
I recognize the competing questions here. One man&#039;s terrorist is another man&#039;s freedom fighter, etc. [the same point a lot of people suddenly didn&#039;t like so much when it was applied to the men who blew up the twin towers.] It&#039;s worth having a continent&#039;s resources go underused, and for cities to become destroyed a la Detroit, because the majority is black, and the majority is always right. I get all those arguments. I just don&#039;t think it&#039;s so poshut. Although there are flaws to all of us, most of us don&#039;t have the massive lingering legacy of Nelson Mandela. I would never refer to him as &quot;a great man.&quot;]]></description>
