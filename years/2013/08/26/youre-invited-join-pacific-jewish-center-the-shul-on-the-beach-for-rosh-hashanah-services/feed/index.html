		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;The services are well paced,... I promise not to bore you with longwinded talks or super slow chanting.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;


If only more rabbis would make that commitment,   Super friendly people help, and they&#039;re not hard to find outside of super-sized Jewish communities.  In places where people aren&#039;t friendly, it&#039;s a lot to ask a rabbi to change them.  Locations are never easily changed.   What every rabbi CAN do is commit to making the services more pleasant, cutting down on long piyutim everyone mumbles through, and whenever you sing, keeping it up-beat or at least inspiring.  Finally, they need to work on themselves to remember that even if they&#039;re a &quot;popular rabbi&quot;, 99% of the congregants aren&#039;t there to hear them talk.  They are there to connect to God in whatever way they can and there&#039;s nothing like feeling board to be make you want to give up on that.

Kudos to Rabbi Fink for making that commitment.]]></description>
