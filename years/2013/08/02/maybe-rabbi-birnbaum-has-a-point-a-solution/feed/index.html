		<description><![CDATA[What is the name of a self-titled &quot;Modern Orthodox&quot; seminary, that gives rabbinical ordination to &quot;MO&quot; Rabbis, for the purpose of presiding over &quot;MO&quot; synagogues?


There isn&#039;t one.  There are a wide variety of yeshivot within the world of shomrei mitzvot.  


Eilu v&#039;Eilu etc.


It&#039;s wrong to treat &quot;MO&quot; as if it were a liberal break off movement from Torah Judaism, like Reform, Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Renewal.


Those break off groups would love to cast OU and NCYI affiliated synagogues in that role - just another break off group.  It gives the rest of them legitimacy.  As if to say, &quot;See?  They change halacha too, we just change it a little bit more&quot;.


I reject that notion, and I hope that you do as well.  There&#039;s no cause to put a modifier next to the word Orthodox for the great rabbanim of our generation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[what makes you think that someone who drives on shabbat to go shul is fully aware of what that means? the people i know who drive to shul on shabbat (granted not many because this is a chul l&#039;aretz thing) would never say &quot;i am shomer shabbat&quot;. they might say &quot;i am shomer shabbat but i drive to shul&quot;, or &quot;i&#039;m not shomer shabbat, but i like or identify with that particular shul&quot;. 



you&#039;re misusing lifnei iver. if that was the definition, than we are all guilty of it regarding avak lashon harah (for example).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I resent being accused of trolling.


I post using my full name, I never attack or insult any other commenter, and I mean what I write.


If you don&#039;t want me to continue the discussion on your blog, I won&#039;t.


You are incorrect - one cannot be a Reform rabbi &quot;no matter where one gets ordination&quot;.  It&#039;s simply not true. 


URJ-member synagogues only hire graduates of HUC-JIR.  Period.   


Conservative synagogues used to hire Orthodox rabbis, but I doubt that they can do so any longer.


My point is, unlike URJ and USCJ, there is no appointed body of a separate movement called &quot;Modern Orthodoxy&quot;.


It&#039;s not an entity separate from shmirat hamitzvot.  &quot;MO&quot; isn&#039;t an entity at all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Driving on shabbat in a way that the person fully understands is prohibited, is one violation.

Driving to shul on shabbat, which the person may justify as permitted (or at least &quot;not as bad&quot;) is two violations - breaking shabbat, and bearing false witness to oneself. 

Possibly, one could tack on a third prohibition of &quot;lifnei iver&quot;, when others see him/her parking at/near the shul on shabbat.

Therefore, diving to shul on shabbat is two or three times worse than driving to the mall on shabbat.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not aware of any yeshiva that labels itself Modern Orthodox.


Yeshivat Chovovei Torah labels itself Open Orthodox.  I suppose that one could refer to their graduates  as OO rabbis.


Since there is no MO yeshiva, there are no MO rabbis.


&quot;Modern&quot; (or the yeshivish slur &quot;modernishe&quot;) is a disdainful epithet used to attack brilliant rabbanim like HaRav Hershel Shachter.


So no, HaRav Fink, I am not &quot;trolling&quot;, I am defending the honor and integrity of the amazing rabbanim from whom I had the distinct privilege to learn.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My comment was in response to Mark, who wrote:

&lt;i&gt;Better to drive to shul than to drive to the mall or the movie theater.&lt;/i&gt;

It&#039;s not halachically better, it&#039;s halachically worse.

The social atmosphere of the gym, the park, and the bowling alley, are all better choices than a shul.

And if you will object that cultural Jews want to socialize with other Jews, the JCC and certain country clubs (depending on the city) are rife with Jews on the weekend.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With all due respect, Rabbi Fink, I believe you&#039;re laboring under a misconception. See Birnbaum ends off his article saying that he&#039;s looking for solutions but, as you pointed out, his article was so offensive that one has to conclude he isn&#039;t in fact looking for solutions. This was just a reminder to the Yated readership to avoid precisely what you&#039;re suggesting here; do not engage in dialogue, do not ever attend a shabbaton together with MO people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree.  Driving to shul is MUCH worse.  


At least when a knowledgeable Jew drives to the mall or movie theater on shabbat, s/he can&#039;t excuse their desecration of Gd&#039;s Holy Gift to His People.


I&#039;m not talking about people who are trying to transition to shmirat hamitzvot; I mean specifically those who justify their shabbat violations by praying in an Orthodox shul.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a difference between approving of ones hashkafa, and approving of ones perversion of halacha.

Shomrei mitzvot from all different hashkafot will speak in the various batei knesset in my town.

I can have a difference in outlook on specific issues, and still recognize the validity of the Torah of a given presenter.

However, R/C are not halachic.  Inviting a speaker from a non-halachic group, who claims to be teaching &quot;Torah&quot;, is placing a stumbling block before the blind, and is a serious scriptural violation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First time commenting here ever. Great article. I live in Lakewood, I have both types of neighbors (yes even here in Lakewood), I&#039;m more to the right side and one thing I can&#039;t understand WHY can&#039;t we just respect each other, why the attitude toward the left. What does it hurt to respect be nice? Why not just pretend? I always ask the extreme here, what harm will it cause if you&#039;re just tactful and friendly? And what if you just pretend to be?? I don&#039;t get it. Maybe bec I&#039;m an out of towner so I&#039;m not choshuve enough to get the general attitude in town here. Thx for an awesome respectful article.]]></description>
