		<description><![CDATA[I couldnt tell if you were expressing your own opinions or paraphrasing that of TNR. (A very influentuial magazine read by .00003% of the population.) Thus, I&#039;m not sure who is the one who believes the following nonsense:

Women have been attacked physically, verbally, and psychologically for a long time and it is starting to create a negative reaction.

 women from the modern orthodox community in Israel are finding themselves aligned with secular feminist Jews in Israel.

women who feel hurt and abused are turning to secular and Reform Jews for salvation.
These are gross generalizations without an ounce of truth to them. Rather patronizing, too - who, pray tell, are these &quot;hurt and abused&quot; women now lifting their eyes to secular and reform [their are reform jews in israel?] for &quot;salvation?&quot;  Surely you&#039;re aware that liberal publications are prone to making assertions based upon wishful thinking, hoping that the mere use of assertions as though they were fact will help them turn into actual facts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a much bigger reason to prevent a split. Seems as if when a people split from Judaism (or perhaps any religion) over religious doctrine issues, if they become large and powerful, they come to greatly resent the remaining Jews and eventually feel the need to slaughter them. The risk may be very low today, but who knows what could happen over centuries and millenia.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Women have been attacked physically, verbally, and psychologically for a long time and it is starting to create a negative reaction.



A little confused here. MO women are finding more in common with their secular counterparts over this? Are we saying MO do these things or is it the charedi that are doing these things? Generally, we associate this behaivor with charedi....so why go to the secular? Why not stay within their natural home (MO) where they can plot attacks against the charedi? Sounds like they are saying MO in inept at fighting charedi behaivor and therefore have to resort to the secular.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i think that you exaggerated some of the various issues separating the two groups (for example different rabbis; so what, even within both groups are multiple subgroups, each with their own rabbanim). more importantly, i think that the real difference is one of self identification. more and more, much of the DL world (not all) is identifying as israeli, or the &quot;israeli element&quot; of this group&#039;s identification is becoming stronger.  At the same time the &quot;ethnic group identification&quot; is becoming weaker and weaker. 

in addition, more and more of the DL has been questioning or even rejecting much of what was taken as a given in terms of the religious status quo (for various reasons; the chareidi takeover of the rabbinate is only one small element). the end result is that if you were to ask what type of state people want to see here in another 10 years, the answers of the DL and secular people might be quite close (putting the question of YOSH to the side for the moment).  Add in that we work together in the army, at work, in amutot, live together in mixed neighborhoods. Therefore the jump to work with a secular israeli becomes less and less. in act it becomes quite natural. 



on the other side you have (i&#039;ll leave out the adjectives) people like chayim valder calling for chareidi autonomy. i have no doubt that most chareidim reject the idea. but it is being raised (maybe this is just post-lapid/bennett anger speaking). but even without this story, group/subgroup identity in the chareidi world is an extremely important element in their self-identification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It might happen in Israel&quot;


Perhaps it hasn&#039;t formally happened, but in almost every other way it has already happened. dati leumi people don&#039;t vote for the same people as charedim do, don&#039;t support the same institutions, for the most part don&#039;t support the same rabbis, generally use a different kosher authority (DL uses rabbanut, charedi uses the various badatzim or mehadrin), and finally don&#039;t live in the same places and don&#039;t daven in the same places. There&#039;s hardly any connection anymore between dati leumi folks and charedi folks.]]></description>
