		<description><![CDATA[This was a great post.  After having dated both in the secular and haredi worlds, I can say that I prefer the secular system.  There is a certain ease in meeting people, a more reasonable pace to the relationships and less &quot;nit-picking&quot; over unimportant information and details.  Plus, non-frum singles have value beyond their martial status.  In the secular world I&#039;m treated as an adult, and viewed as a composite of my qualities and life experiences.  Whereas, in the frum world I&#039;m treated as a &quot;girl&quot; (despite my age and rather adult life).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why is it so hard for you to find a reasonable answer to that question?  Being a blazingly heterosexual male doesn&#039;t make one a bad person, but it does mean that he should be very careful in his casual dealings with women and that women (high school girls, too) should understand that legitimate need for general separation.
I have had relatively deep friendships with contemporary young women when I was in my teens, and in those cases, we kept adequate separation, and conversation was appropriate and kept to a minimum. I am now good friends with their husbands, and they are good friends with my wife. This is because we were able to ensure that there was no opportunity to flirt with fooling around.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I certainly agree that the concept of tzniut is not properly taught in most Jewish educational institutions, but I would not spend one cent or one second on making &quot;[b]eing single... a great time in one’s life [when] great things can be accomplished.&quot; If the singles crisis is such a problem in the frum community, what do you think is going on outside it? Being single has become so great in the outside world that men (and, increasingly, women) have little interest in marriage. At least the straight ones. I guess the gays will have to save traditional marriage. Again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post. Aside from social pressure to get married, there is also the fact that it&#039;s very difficult to be celibate (yes, for women too) and getting married solves that problem. It&#039;s difficult because talking about sex is extremely taboo among frum women and if I were ever to say (to close female friends) I wanted to get married because it was hard to be abstinent people would look at me like I had three heads.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good points, but I know many single women and rarely do I hear that women WANT children more than a husband. There&#039;s just more FEAR and PRESSURE around children than a spouse. You&#039;re never too old to marry, you don&#039;t want more than one spouse (whereas many women want enough time to have multiple children), and you don&#039;t become less desirable for marriage to similarly aged men because of your age- if not for your ability to have children. So I don&#039;t think many single women PREFER children to a husband, that need just gets more emphasized because of the time constraints on it, AND how it affects your marriage prospects because of those time constraints as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Christians (particularly Mormons) have no shidduch crisis, they just &quot;flirt to convert&quot;.  Now, I know that we don&#039;t missionize goyim, but would it be so terrible to give a heter to an older frum single girl, and let her secular date (without going all the way) with a goy?  He will fall in love, she will say that he has to convert and live a frum life, and he&#039;ll go along with it.  It might be unusual, but it&#039;s better than a bunch of depressed frum women in their 30&#039;s, who are likely to go off the derech anyway if they don&#039;t get married.]]></description>

And while you&#039;re so worried about single frum people, please, also get started on helping homosexual frum people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[if someone starving asked you for food, and you said, hey, let&#039;s make it acceptable to be frum and staring, no one would stand for that.  The single people crying out are telling us they are emotionally and spiritually starving -- help!  Help, stop giving us platitudes, help, stop treating us like we&#039;re diseased, help, remember that we are alone on Shabbos and holidays, help, we are SCARED we will never experience such a fundamental part of life and the Jewish religion!  Help!  They are crying out for help because the alternative is to one of the millions of people walking the planet who might not be Jewish.  The frum singles are looking to us -- the religious Jewish community - to give them a reasonable alternative.  I don&#039;t know how long we can realistically expect people to stay simultaneously frum and single -- human comanionships is as basic as food and water.  That&#039;s what single people want  us to know first.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I skimmed the original post and I have to say I understand where she is coming from. She admits to not being in a good place so it may come off as harsh and to be honest I have had moments when I have almost written a similar list. When people get married they so soon forget the hours they spent crying on my shoulder about being single. They start asking me if I know any girls for their husband&#039;s friends. Then theyy stop talking to me completely, as if I have a the single disease and they are scared it may rub off on them. Us singles are branded as flawed and we are told that we are the problem and if we could fix ourselves we wouldn&#039;t be single. Like there are no flawed married people. I love my life, I live it to the fullest, I give to others and am starting to give to myself. However, I want to be married, I want a family, sometimes so much it hurts within every fiber of my being. Are people senstive to this fact, never. If I were married and childless people would have tact (well more people) but because I am single and that is inherently my fault for a plethora of reasons no one feels the need. When my little sister became of age I davened that she shouldn&#039;t go through the struggle and pain I have been through. B&quot;H at least some of my prayers were answered.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My advice to her was - if the shidduch system isn&#039;t working for you, and you&#039;ve given it a few years, widen your horizons and try to find a husband outside the shidduch system. Sure, it&#039;s possible that you will end up with a husband outside your system, maybe even modern orthodox, but so what? If remaining single (and your family, friends, community not helping you) is causing so much anguish, then why is that so bad?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two other reasons she&#039;s focusing on kids more than a husband:


1. You&#039;ve got your whole life to try to find a husband. You do not have your whole life to have children... and unless you&#039;re the one who is realizing you may never have children you&#039;d be terrified....and focusing on that, too. Of course she&#039;s talking about children. That&#039;s the thing that&#039;s fleeting. Guys don&#039;t get this because it&#039;s not often an issue for them.


2. Married people may not talk about their spouses to their single friends because they are trying to be sensitive. 



3. I cant help but detect a wiff of &quot;poor frum men have it hard- women aren&#039;t interested in marrying them for their own sake, but rather just using them for having babies.&quot; -  I think a lot of women feel like they&#039;re the victims of the same thinking, and that has a  LOT to do with why they focus on kids more than spouses.


Women over the age of 30 often have been unfairly passed over because the guys want someone younger. Lets translate that, shall we? They want....you got it....someone whose chances are better at having kids!. ... even in today&#039;s world where having children in ones 30s is a GIVEN and in their late 30s9 and early 40s) as totally normal, and feasible. So if we are to be entirely fair, the GUYS/ Frum society is focused on women who can produce children. Women pick up on that and it becomes an overwhelming part of their anxiety when it comes getting married / moving on to the next stage in life.
Of course they want to be in a relationship...but if the very people who they want to be in a relationship with are rejecting them, that&#039;s NOT who they are going to focus on.]]></description>

You do not have your whole life to have children&#8230; and unless you&#8217;re the one who is realizing you may never have children you&#8217;d be terrified&#8230;.and focusing on that, too. Of course she&#8217;s talking about children. That&#8217;s the thing that&#8217;s fleeting. Guys don&#8217;t get this because it&#8217;s not often an issue for them.</p>
<p>2. Married people may not talk about their spouses to their single friends because they are trying to be sensitive. </p>
<p>3. I cant help but detect a wiff of &#8220;poor frum men have it hard- women aren&#8217;t interested in marrying them for their own sake, but rather just using them for having babies.&#8221; &#8211;  I think a lot of women feel like they&#8217;re the victims of the same thinking, and that has a  LOT to do with why they focus on kids more than spouses.</p>
<p>Women over the age of 30 often have been unfairly passed over because the guys want someone younger. Lets translate that, shall we? They want&#8230;.you got it&#8230;.someone whose chances are better at having kids!. &#8230; even in today&#8217;s world where having children in ones 30s is a GIVEN and in their late 30s9 and early 40s) as totally normal, and feasible. So if we are to be entirely fair, the GUYS/ Frum society is focused on women who can produce children. Women pick up on that and it becomes an overwhelming part of their anxiety when it comes getting married / moving on to the next stage in life.<br />
Of course they want to be in a relationship&#8230;but if the very people who they want to be in a relationship with are rejecting them, that&#8217;s NOT who they are going to focus on.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with the first part of the piece wholeheartedly. But being an adult single is a completely unnatural state that never existed as a norm in history, and our psyches are simply not equipped to live as singles. This is why chazal tell us that an unmarried man is not a man, and that there is no blessing in the life of a single person. I have no shame in being single and admitting that yearning for a wife for years is not a pleasant state to be in--and more important than &quot;career&quot; or the fulfillment of any kind of individual ambition is the imperative to find our soul mate, without which, no matter how &quot;successful&quot; we think we are, we will never be able to fulfill our potentials as individuals and as a society. One of the great fallacies of post-modern thought, and a hallmark of the selfishness of our age, is that we can have a satisfying life without someone to share it with, which just may be the most pernicious lie of our generation. I bless all us singles that we may find our zivugs speedily.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While it may be true that some women want children simply because of peer pressure, I think it is completely unfair to delegitimize the drive for procreation as only that. I have many friends who have always wanted children, who have incredible nurturing instincts and would be wonderful mothers, and for them, wanting children is a perfectly logical extension of their character, and sure, they&#039;d like to find husbands, but having had no luck with men so far, I fail to see why they would keep on the rose-colored glasses and naively and blindly believe that the perfect man will turn up some day. Children for them are a known commodity, husbands are not. Of course they&#039;d be more interested in the children aspect of marriage at that point, rather than on some unicorn of a husband.

And wanting children is hardly a desire exclusive to women. As a woman who would like to find a soulmate someday but has no particular interest in having children (I consider myself &quot;undecided&quot;), I often find myself at the other end of this spectrum of dehumanization. I think it would be great if people could just value me and want to be with me for purely what I am and what I offer intellectually and emotionally, but most frum men have been culturally programmed to want children just as much as most of the women have. So many of my potential relationships have disintegrated because the guy isn&#039;t okay with the possibility that I might never want to have kids.

I also feel obliged to point out that being &quot;terminally single&quot; in the frum community takes its toll on the men as well. It&#039;s not just that the frum community has no firm place for single women -- it has no firm place for singles, period. The intense focus on marriage affects both genders, and makes it difficult for single people to feel like they aren&#039;t just in some kind of limbo, waiting for what everyone seems to consider to be the &quot;next&quot; stage. (This is not just a frum world problem, by the way. Society as a whole is extremely couple-focused.) I completely agree that there needs to be some kind of paradigm shift, where people can be comfortable and fulfilled as individuals even if they are not part of a matched set.

Of course, all of that is much easier said than done.]]></description>
