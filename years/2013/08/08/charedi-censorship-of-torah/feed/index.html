		<description><![CDATA[Similar to the kosher phone phenomenon.  Before the kosher phones came out, the same people had cell phones.  By limiting the phones from not only internet but also text sms the phone companies were able to shift the balance to more costly airtime and voicemails.  And ultimately it made cell phones a standard household item for every Charedi, while before they were always one step back from even this modernity.  I suspect this is also a marketing ploy - anything computerized is likely seen as too &quot;modernish&quot; but once someone has filtered out some sefarim and given it a Charedi name, they&#039;ll actually sell more to the Charedi community.

Could it be the censored books are things like Moreh Nevuchim, or even more logical borderline writings such as Cassuto?]]></description>

1) Who&#039;s ahead, them or Hebrewbooks.org?
2) Are they like Hebrewbooks.org in that they provide you with pdf&#039;s of each book?  Because then you could ask: how many of the 600000 books are even legible to us?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry but this post is beyond ridiculous.
How can you call this censorship when the books being &quot;censored&quot; are readily available? There&#039;s a discount being offered to those who likely don&#039;t want those books. And those who do want them can readily purchase them.
This is &quot;censorship&quot;!!??
This post makes it clear to me that you&#039;re looking to find fault with anything and everything charedi, even if it means grasping at straws to do so.]]></description>
