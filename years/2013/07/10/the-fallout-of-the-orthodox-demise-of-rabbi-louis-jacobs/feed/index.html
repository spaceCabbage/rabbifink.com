		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Perhaps having a more flexible version of Torah M’Sinai that is consistent with historical orthodox Judaism would be of great use to frum skeptics everywhere.



How flexible? You have to give the more right elements within OJ a little credit here. They understand the slippery slope here. They understand that if you start tearing away at the foundation, piece by piece it starts collapsing. So how flexible would YOU allow before even you say something is out of bounds?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course, the Hertz commentary is mostly comprised of Jewish sources.  But, its most important chiddush was to provide historical context -- which is particularly useful for the Haftarot.  For example (since I previously typed this in and have it to hand), the introduction to Haftorat Behaalotecha informs us:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Zechariah was one of the exiles who returned from Babylon when Cyrus promulgated his decree of Restoration in the year 537.  He began his prophecies about 17 years afterwards. Disastrous seasons and the hostility of neighbours had discouraged the people, and all operations in connection with rebuilding the Temple had long ceased.


At this juncture the prophets Haggai and Zechariah appeared, roused the people from their despondency and fired them to resume the work which has been suspended.


In our Haftorah, Zechariah assures the people of the Divine assistance in their work of rebuilding the Temple and of national rehabilitation…&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

&quot;The Hertz was a masterpiece in its time, a piece of literature.

		<description><![CDATA[In regard to Rabbi J.H. Hertz, one should note that his smicha was from JTS and as Wikipedia notes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While he was Chief Rabbi of the group of Synagogues known as the United Hebrew Congregations of the British Empire, led by the United Synagogue,
 some new immigrants who had arrived since the 1880s regarded it as not 
orthodox enough. Hertz tried both persuasion and such force as he could 
muster to influence them; he added to his credibility among these 
immigrants by persuading Rabbi Yehezkel Abramsky to become head of the London Beth Din.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Which iled to some of the crises CR Sacks faced during his tenure.

For what its worth, when I was growing up in the mid-to-late 1970s, the Hertz Chumash was normative in MO shuls.  Used copies are available online for under $20 and it remains a fantastic resource that every MO home library should have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Perhaps having a more flexible version of Torah M’Sinai that is consistent with historical orthodox Judaism would be of great use to frum skeptics everywhere&quot;

I don&#039;t know(you touched on  a similar question of utility regarding Tamar Ross).

There is value in knowing that others struggled, but I don&#039;t know if that would help everyone. These are some quotes:

&quot;Dismissing or de-legitimizing Dr. Shapiro’s work is a disservice to that significant minority of our bnei and bnot Torah who are true theology seekers. A serious yeshivah student who finds one of Maimonides’ Ikarim unsettling or problematic may be relieved to discover that a great Rishon also had trouble with that very same issue. The fact that at some point a “pesak” may have been issued requiring everyone to accept the Rambam’s Ikarim as absolute dogma will not assuage the person who is struggling with his own personal beliefs. On the other hand, books like Dr. Shapiro’s can offer the necessary soothing balm for the troubled soul who seeks to be frum and part of the Orthodox community, even though he has trouble with Maimonidean dogma.&quot;

(R. Daniel Korobkin, Jewish Action)

&quot;Knowing about Rabbi Weinberg’s struggle regarding the rabbinic attitude to Gentiles is particularly important, I was told, because it enables Jews deeply troubled by these issues to retain their spiritual compass; to recognize that such inner struggle can be legitimate as long as it takes place within the context of an ultimate commitment to the sacrosanct and immutable character of the halakhic tradition....”

(&quot;Facing the Truths of History&quot;, R. JJ Shachter)

“The quest for authentic spirituality requires confronting the issues that challenge an individual’s belief in themselves, in G-d, and in their capacity to connect the two. Our educational system celebrates questioning and innovation in the realm of textual analysis, but is less tolerant of such critical thinking in the realms of dogmatic philosophy and halachic standards...While, it is not spiritually healthy to encourage the pursuit of every question and doubt to its absolute conclusion, the incongruence between the dogmatic approach to religious ideals and the critical thinking that underscores most academic and professional endeavors risks creating an unintended and often intense crisis of faith. Forums are needed to address these issues, and to validate curiosity as a mature and passionate dimension of religious growth. ”

(R. Yaakov Glasser, Klal Perspectives, Spring 2012)]]></description>
