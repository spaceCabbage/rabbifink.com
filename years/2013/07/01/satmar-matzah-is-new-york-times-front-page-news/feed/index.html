		<description><![CDATA[The Rambam&#039;s assertion is that at the time of the Chasimas Hatalmud, all the participants in the Mesorah were able to talk to each other, so the Talmud Bavli represents the consensus of all Chachmei Yisrael. 

The far flung communities that were not in regular contact with the Amoraim of Bavel considered themselves subordinate to the Chachmei HaTalmud, and accepted their Halachic rulings. Those communities &quot;did their best&quot; but, when informed of a Halachic ruling from the Amoraim, considered that ruling binding upon them, because they recognized that all of the participants in the conversation were in Bavel. 

That idea is fundamental to Halacha, because, per Rambam, it is the reason that Talmud Bavli is binding on all Jews. It is a very important idea, and it might be considered the key idea of Orthodox Judaism (as opposed to Conservative Judaism, which considers itself authorized to dispute the Talmud in interpreting the Torah.)



You have no evidence to undermine that assertion of Rambam (It&#039;s obviously not the Rambam&#039;s idea, he just articulates it very well, but the same idea is found in the writing of many others, including R&#039; Sherira and R&#039; Saadya Gaonim, and it is also mentioned by Ramban.) As an Orthodox Rabbi, you should not discard that assertion, and you should certainly not call it ridiculous, unless you have hard evidence. But you don&#039;t have hard evidence. What you have is your ignorant misreading of a book. And on that basis, you decided to discard a key tenet of Orthodox Judaism, and trumpet your discarding of that tenet on a blog that includes your name.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, if a Yekke Rabbi in Gedarim writes to a fellow Rabbi in Washington Heights that he is causing congregants to defect from his Shul to the Shul of the Litvaks, that means that there is a vibrant community in Washington Heights that follows Talmud Germania, instead of Talmud Bavli?!?!?!
There was 10th century Minhag Eretz Yisrael, and 10th century Minhag Bavel (and Minhag Spain, and Minhag Maghreb, and Minhag Ashkenaz, and probably another 50 communities.) That, in no way, undermines that Halachic principle, elucidated in Rambams intro to Mishna Torah, that the Talmud Bavlie reflects the CONSENSUS of ALL CHACHMEI YISRAEL at the time of its sealing, and, therefore, all the rulings of Talmud Bavli are binding on all Jews.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Against my better judgement, I bought the book and read it. The only thing that I found that might sound like something you referenced was in Chapter 8, and all it talks about is a Synagogue in Fustat (Cairo) that was affiliated with the &quot;Palestinian Rabbinate&quot; as opposed to the &quot;Babylonian Rabbinate&quot;. 

That is a far, far, cry from the assertion that 

&quot;We know from the Cairo Geniza that there was a vibrant Jerusalem Talmud community well into the 12th century. They lived side by side with the Babylonian Talmud community (and the Karaite community). But clearly, they had different traditions and legal codes. Pretending this isn&#039;t true is ridiculous.&quot;

There is no indication in the book that there was a community in Egypt that viewed the Talmud Yerushalmi as Halachically authoritative over Bavli.  There is no historical evidence in the book that undermines the fundamental Halachic principle that Talmud Bavli reflects the CONSENSUS of ALL CHACHMEI YISRAEL of its time. 

You, sir, are an Oicher Yisrael. It&#039;s disgusting for you to make an assertion, and characterize anyone that disputes your assertion as ridiculous, when that assertion contradicts the fundamental Halachic principles, and has no historical backing whatsoever. You are a Machti es HaRabim]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s the thing: Nobody is asking you to adopt Chumras you don&#039;t want to adopt. But, for some reason, you seem to have this need to negate the positive motivations that other people have for their own religious observances.

		<description><![CDATA[There were many communities in Europe that were Mehader to cut the wheat on a day that was very dry, and even to wait a few days where there was no rain. See, for example, the Lubavitcher Rebbe&#039;s description of wheat-cutting in Lubavitch - from www.chabad.org/2846. 

Reb Zalman had a meticulous system for choosing the field with the highest quality wheat, and for choosing the day and hour of the harvest. The conditions for the harvest were: a clear and bright day on which the sun shone in its full intensity, and that no rain had fallen in the previous three days. The set hours for harvesting the shemurah were from noon to two o’clock or two-thirty in the afternoon.



The reason is probably because they didn&#039;t want to harvest any wheat that had rain on it, because once the wheat is cut, it is Halachically susceptible to becoming Chametz. 
It&#039;s not much of a stretch to assume that this practice of cutting wheat from a dry region, instead of a region that often gets rain in the summer, like New York, is just an extension of that. 
The question is: Why would a Rabbi like E. Fink assume that the correct explanation is the one given by Heilman, who is notorious for his scornful attitude towards Chasidim, instead of digging a little and being Dan L&#039;Kaf Z&#039;chus?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What i dont get is how we have the beitzim to think we are holier, or more frum than our parents, our grandparents, etc.....i mean what happened to yeridos hadoros?

We cant just make new things up....how they did it was fine, why in the world do we think that making new stringincies is what god wants from us?

Where did that come from?

It seems way more than just &quot;asu s&#039;yag latorah&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the days before the combine harvester came along wheat was generally harvested before it was ripe (chayei odom klal 128) in order to prevent wheat shattering, then it was threshed separately after drying, (for p&#039;shutim it was dried in the field and for shmure it was watched while it dried).
Since the combine came along the wheat has to be dead and dry before harvest, so it can be cut and threshed at once.

This is where the problem starts, that you know for sure it rained on ripe wheat. so its only good b&#039;shaas hadchak (t&#039;shuvos meil tz&#039;duku 69).

Wheat has to dry down to 13% moisture before its stored or it will spoil, A farmer that has available a drier will harvest his wheat at 20% moisture and take on the extra cost of drying in order to save the quality of his wheat.

That&#039;s the benefit of growing wheat in Arizona, it doesn&#039;t rain in the day&#039;s when the wheat is mature till it&#039;s dry for harvest and storage.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did no one else think about the rabbinic line:  &quot;they have held on to the chaff and discarded the kernels?&quot;  Given that the motive is pure one-upmanship and factionalism (i.e. sinas chinam) how can anyone approve of this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The gemara just says &quot;cold,&quot; but I don&#039;t think there can be a doubt that a freezer is sufficiently cold.  It is Mishna (and following Gemara) on the bottom of 46a discussing taking challah from dough that you are going to bake as matza on Pesach.  


What you took as challah is not allowed to be baked but it also can&#039;t be let to sit and rise, so the Ben Besaira says to put it in &quot;cold.&quot;  This is brought down as a b&#039;dieved solution in the SH&quot;A (Orach Chaim 456).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting article. A few points to consider. 1) The Gemara Pesachim 33a (toward the bottom) ״כגון דאחמיץ במחובר״  in a case where it leavened while still attached to the ground. 2) Pesachim 39b .... ״לא לימחימ
One shall not thicken a a stew with flour that was previously cooked on Pesach since it may not have baked entirely&quot; (see various rishonim and chachmas Shlomo roach Chaim 563 in the Shulchan a aruch). 3) see Sharei Teshuva Orach Chaim 560 who discusses the origin of gebrokts and the ability of Matza to rise again. 4) I see no reason to disagree on Halacha and minhag as long as its based on Torah and Chazal, tanach Gemara midrash Zohar rishonim Shulchan aruch etc. 5) I believe mysticism is a huge part of Orthodox Judaism and simple rationale is not always present, there are instances of deeper meaning...  All the best Rabbi. ]]></description>
