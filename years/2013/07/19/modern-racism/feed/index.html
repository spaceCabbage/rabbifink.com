		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s culture, not skin color, and the relationship is causative.  Most African-Americans (not speaking about Africans in any other place) largely belong to a similar culture that is different than the dominant American culture.  Or different enough that it produces these results.  Many rise above it or reject it.  So, like lashon hara, take precautions, but don&#039;t believe it until you know it to be true about any individual African-American.  In contrast, most redheads do not belong to a particular American subculture or see themselves as belonging to it.


As for Zimmerman, I honestly don&#039;t think he was skin color motivated as much as he was culture motivated.  Martin displayed his culture by his clothing (hoodie).  I am scared of people in hoodies, pale or dark.  It&#039;s suspicious when someone has their face and head all covered up at night.  In Florida.  I guess I&#039;d have to know the temperature if people were otherwise walking around with scarves.  But maybe I&#039;m wrong.  Maybe Zimmerman was influenced by the skin color.  The tragedy happened not when he took silent precautions and called the police, but when he took matters into his hands and got out of his car.  I accept the jury&#039;s verdict that he didn&#039;t start the fight, but he was imprudent to say the least.


My b&#039;rakha is that we all (darker-skinned and pale-skinned people alike) become color blind and join in a dominant American culture of faith and righteousness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this post, and I agree for the most part, but...

Market research, planning, public outreach, etc., recognize common traits in specific ethnicities and races. Granted, these traits are not present in every individual, but those traits do exist. The traits are most likely due to cross correlation, such as stating that a higher percentage of Black Americans are below the poverty line, or a higher percentage of inner city residents are Black Americans, or it could sinply be corrolated with a culture. However, there is a statistical significance to being Black, If I were to be able to prove that there were some trait that was prevalent at a statistically significant level for red heads, it would be logical to react to that in some way. That certainly does not mean that we should punish or be suspicioius of people for simply sharing a trait, but we cannot be entirely unaware of the correlations either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You made 2 points here.

1. More crime may be due to selected enforcement. Which I happen to agree with.

2. Since we can&#039;t find a correlation between skin color and crime the data is meaningless. This I disagree with. I think you are using statistics in a way it wasn&#039;t meant to be used.

When a coin is tossed we expect 50/50 heads or tails. Obviously it is meaningless when determining what the next toss would bring. More so when the coins results are 60/40 with a significant amount of tosses we declare the coin not fair. Regardless of whether there is or isn&#039;t a known reason for it. All we can say is with a certain level of certainty is that the coins is not fair.

Just because we don&#039;t know the exact property that causes a disproportionate amount of crime from a certain segment of the pop. does not mean there isn&#039;t one. Rather we can say more likely then not with a level of certainty, there is one. That is if it is statistically significant.


The second problem is that you assume there is such a thing as truly understanding causation. We can never truly find the causation of anything. We can&#039;t find the bridge. All we ever have is that cause X is followed by effect Y. Never do we find the connection all we have is the observation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Folks,

Since I&#039;ve apparently stumbled upon a real &#039;select&#039; group of...ahem...scholars,  let me remind you that Travyon Martin is an Affirmative Action Hero.

Liberals looking at the case judge him according to an ENTIRELY different set of standards. Why? Because He&#039;s black.

George Zimmerman called the police before he did ANYTHING that fateful night.
He repeatedly called them and did TWO post-incident interviews without an attorney.

But, the &#039;terrified&#039; cute, cuddly little middle schooler being &#039;stalked&#039; by this menacing angry MMA expert,  NEVER called the police. He never asked his friend to call the police, nor did he knock on a neighbor&#039;s door asking THEM to call the police. But, Trayvon didn&#039;t have to.

Why?  Because He&#039;s black.

George Zimmerman never uttered a SINGLE racial epithet. This despite MSNBC doctoring one of his calls to make him appear racist and ABC using 1000x audio amplification to &#039;find&#039; an epithet that never happened.

OTOH, Trayvon, as revealed by his good friend and star witness for the prosecution,  used EVERY vile racial expression in the book that night.

But, that&#039;s OK. We don&#039;t hold Trayvon&#039;s expression of overt racism against him. IN fact we&#039;ve already FORGOTTEN about it.

Why? Because He&#039;s black.

George Zimmerman who had lived almost twice as long as Travyon at the time of the incident, had a few brushes with the law. Even though he was never found guilty of anything, we hold that against hi

Seventeen year-old Trayvon was discovered to have stored pictures on his cell of under aged naked girls (aka kiddie porn), him illegally holding a firearm, and tons of &#039;weed&#039; shots. He was suspended from school MULTIPLE  times and, at one point, was found in possession of all kinds of nefarious contraband.

But, we have given Trayvon a pass for that.

Why? Because He&#039;s black.

What? you thought Affirmative Action was just about granting LESS deserving applicants better jobs or spots in incoming freshman classes?

Silly You! That&#039;s the OLD Affirmative Action.....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[More gibberish from a secular Jew whose religion is Liberal Party Politics.
If we accept your premise that we can&#039;t draw any connection from one black to another, then there is no such thing as a Black Community.

Almost all black leaders use the term. What do they mean when they say &#039;Black Community&#039; if not people connected by just ONE thing - being black?

After all, blacks are each individual persons with their own
inherent set of characteristics. They live in different cities, states...even countries.

Therefore, using the &#039;rabbi&#039;s&#039; crackerjack logic, the use of the term &#039;black community is racist. 

Not sure if it&#039;s old  racism, new racism or new coke.

But, just remember that the next time you hear your favorite Democratic
race hustler use the expression &#039;Black Community&#039; or the equivalent. 

You know, like Pres Obama did in his recent Trayvon speech that had you liberals panting like groupies. He&#039;s a racist. Which is what we&#039;ve been trying to tell you blind liberals for years. So, thank you &#039;rabbi&#039; for bringing the left and right together on this very important point.

BTW, I know liberals well enough to suggest that our &#039;rabbi&#039; will now try to weasel out of what he just said by clarifying (read contradicting) or justifying the racist terms I&#039;ve identified as being a result of the history of oppression by whites against blacks. IOW, it will STILL be whitey&#039;s fault.

PS This kind of brainless piece is very typical of the Liberal Community. And yes they ARE all violent....towards the truth.

BAM.

PS This black is a LIAR. But, it doesn&#039;t mean that all blacks are.
Well, her husband is too. He lied under oath.

		<description><![CDATA[People are also organized into communities that share characteristics and some responsibility for each other.  The communities are sometimes based on religion, shared heritage, country of origin, or race.  If the Black community in a certain place is plagued by crime, then it might not be unreasonable to look suspiciously at the members of the Black community in that city.  If the Jewish community in a certain city is plagued with dishonesty or tax evasion, then people in that place will judge the Jews based on that community characteristic as well.  

The liberal imperative to judge each person by themselves without reference to their community is so counter-intuitive that it is seen as unrealistic.  This hurts the anti-racism cause because it makes people think that &quot;in reality&quot; racist views are true, but that a person is asked not to express them because they are not acceptable.  

Instead, we should be allowed judge people as individuals and as members of their communities with the following caveats:

1) We need to suppress discriminatory policies towards members of a community in hiring practices, courts of laws, government policies, even if it is realistic to suspect community members of specfic problems

2) We need to judge people only by communities that they themselves identify with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i live in nyc.  everyone is a little bit racist.  everyone is a little bit prejudice.  i am an astute observer of the scene in nyc.  black folks are just as good at prejudging as whites.  it&#039;s all pretty subtle -- and to my eye?  totally normal, human, and fair (mostly fair.) Every day, there are millions of interactions between whites and blacks that come off without a hitch in this city.  Every day in NYC there are thousands (tens of thousands?) of interactions between cops and blacks that come off without an injury.  I live in a &quot;tough&quot; neighborhood in Brooklyn -- like all of NYC it is NOTHING compared to the bad old days -- but it is still very tough relative to other areas.  I have watched many dozens of fraught interactions between cops and blacks.  Even violent ones.  More than a dozen that ended in arrests.  Some where police were attacked by blacks or latinos.  Never has one ended in tragedy.  I watch cops EVERY week or month de-escalate situations.  No more &quot;I&#039;m the toughest MFer on the block&quot; is the cops credo.  They de-escalate sometimes VERY fraught situations.


Then one kid tragically, wrongly, is killed.  And what do we hear?  &quot;All cops are racists who want to kill you.&quot;  There are LITERALLY millions of fraught encounters per year in NYC between cops and tough kids, poor kids, ex-cons, mentally ill young men, angry young men, depressed, end-of-their rope young men of color. 



Every four or five years a tragic ending. A mistake.  A shiny object is misidentified.  A cop fires in fear.  Hears a bullet, sees another cop fall.  Turns out it was a firecracker, the other cop tripped on the curb -- and tragedy results.


Five million fraught encounters.  One horrible mistake (that will completely destroy that cop&#039;s life forever -- he will never go anywhere in his career, he will be sued, he will spend two years on trial --- NO cop no matter HOW racist would EVER WANT to commit murder of a member of a race he hated this way -- unless he is TOTALLY SELF-DESTRUCTIVE and wishes to see his own life turned into LIVING HELL.)


Blacks who act badly are everywhere in NYC -- many are poor, depressed, undiagnosed, angry, scared, overlooked, poorly raised, drug addicted, drug involved, at the end of their rope, afraid to back down, sick of having nothing, of being nothing, of being packed into bad housing -- that I totally understand.  It sucks to be or feel any of the above.  In NYC virtually EVERYONE is ready to &quot;go off&quot; in a split second.  It is only by virtue of upbringing, prozac, the summer house, the good job they can&#039;t jeapordize, the kids they need to be role models to, their realization that they are too old or weak to win a fight with the guy who is breathing all over them in the packed 110 degree subway -- that people decline to lose it.


change the stand your ground laws.  they are accidents and fatal encounters waiting to happen.  They need rewriting.
