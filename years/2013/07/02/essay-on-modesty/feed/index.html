Discussion with Moishela (with his family)

A Handicapped child 5775 #4

4 Nissan 5775   (Mar 23, ‘15)

&quot;The Seven Pure Korbonos&quot;

Oy, oy, oy, what a terrible tragedy. When will the suffering end? When will Moshiach finally come? It’s beginning to be so so difficult to wait, so difficult day after day, tragedy after tragedy, to wait and to wait and to wait. We Daven every day, several times a day, that Moshiach should come. Where is he? Where is he? How much suffering? How often can we listen to a father’s cry? “I had so much hope for these children. I had so much hope for their future,” he said crying hysterically, but he added, “I trust Hashem and I know that everything Hashem does is for our good. I have Bitachon in Hashem and I have no Taanos.” Where does a man, where does a Yid get so much Koach in the deepest sorrow of his whole life, a sorrow that most people never feel? How could he have so much trust in Hashem and how could we have so little? These Korbonos, these perfect Korbonos, had no blemish on them. They were perfect. They were put on the Mizbayach for our sins, not for theirs, not for the sins of their parents, for our sins, for Am Yisroel’s sins.

You look at me and ask, “What sins do we have? We do so much Chessed. We learn Shmiras Haloshon every day. We try to be good Jews. We Daven. We learn etc. How could you say it’s because of our Aveiros?” I say it again it’s because of our Aveiros, not their Aveiros. They had no Aveiros. They were perfect. How can you say that Am Yisroel is so full of Chessed when everywhere I look there is anger one against the other. There’s cheating. There’s Gezel. There’s every Aveirah imaginable, almost. How can you say that we are clean of Aveiros, that Am Yisroel is clean of Aveiros when everybody is at everybody’s throat, when Tznius is at its lowest it has ever been. I don’t think that Am Yisroel has ever been so low in their Tznius, in their Kedusha, not everyone of course, but so many. It’s hard to walk in the streets. You can’t look not to the right, not to the left. You can’t look up. You can’t look down. Everywhere there’s Pritzus, Frum Pritzus. 

I’m talking about the Frum streets not the Chiloni streets or the Goyisha streets. I’m talking about the Frum streets. I don’t know how any Avreich can walk down Malchei Yisroel or Rabbi Akiva or 13th avenue or Stamford Hill or Golders Green etc. without seeing what he is not supposed to see. Even if he keeps Shmiras Einayim, even if he looks down, he sees their feet with high heels with sheer stockings. He looks to the right and he sees people half undressed or very tight clothes. If he looks up he sees women hanging out of windows talking, yelling, bringing full attention to themselves, but no one thinks it’s wrong. Everyone thinks its Yiddishkeit. I’m sure that if our former Gedolim would have now Techias Hamaisim they would run back to their graves because they would be afraid to be spiritually tarnished. What can I tell you? A tragedy like this on such a special Shabbos, how could we deny it’s a message from Hashem?

We learn Shmiras Haloshon, but what is happening? What is happening to us Am Yisroel with all this Machlokes with all the Machlokes specifically among the “learners”, the ones that sit and learn Torah every day? The Machlokes that produces fist fights among the so-called Erlicha Bochurim, violence that has often brought many of the people involved serious injuries, Machlokes that very often looks more like drunken brawls than anything even close to “Leshem Shomayim”. What’s with us Am Yisroel?  You are angry that someone doesn’t want to vote? What do you care? It’s not so simple to vote. However the true fight between the two sides has nothing really to do with voting or any other legitimate reason. Underneath it all it’s just a fight to control. One Gadol said like this, another Gadol said like that, and who are we to decide which one is the greatest Gadol? Very dangerous to get into a fight between two Gedolim. Do what your Gadol wants, but don’t try to destroy another Yid because his Gadol Hador says something else. What’s happened to us?

We’re holding on tight to the tail of the Egel Hazahav and that’s what we’re interested in. We dress him up in a Yarmulka and Tzitzis and we say look he’s Frum. The Egel Hazahav is Frum. It’s a Mitzvah to worship him. He’s a Shaliach from Shomayim Chas Vesholom. It’s a mitzvah to worship him! Oy, Am Yisroel, Oy, Am Yisroel, how are we going to stop these terrible, terrible tragedies. Those children were born to be a sacrifice for us. This was their job in life, but what is our job in life? We have to come closer to Hashem. We have to shed all of this nonsense that we’ve layered ourselves with. We have to stop criticizing other Jews because they are trying to be close to Hashem, or laughing at them because they have taken on more Frum ways.

I warn you Am Yisroel, I warn you clearly there is going to be a great upheaval in the world and that upheaval is going to destroy much of the world. Where do you want to be? Where do you want to find yourself? We’ve spoken for years about a third world war, about all that was going to happen financially and even the greatest of the economists are warning about a devastating crash in the financial world, but not just the financial world, also  in the world of just plain everyday life. We’re going to see and already are seeing tremendous inflation that will eventually destroy the economic base of the whole world. You cannot imagine how many intelligent, well educated people in economics are saying that this is going to happen and its part of our Nevuas as well. So Am Yisroel don’t you think its time to prepare? Don’t you think it’s time to get off your Egel Hazahav and sit down on a chair take a Siddur and cry and cry and say Vidduy and beg Hashem to forgive us and then decide to dedicate all of your life, every single moment of your life to Kiddush Hashem, to getting closer to Hashem, to doing what Hashem, wants His Ratzon all day long 24/7.

What else can I tell you that I haven’t said? If we want to stop the terrible tragedies, we have to shape up. All Am Yisroel has to shape up and get ready for the Geula Sheleimah because whoever does not get close enough to Hashem to see the truth, at least the truth that we can see in this world with all the Hester Panim then when you get to the time of Moshiach, which is going to be very soon you won’t be able to tolerate Olam Habah of Moshiach. It will be so strange to you. You won’t be able to take it because you don’t want to live like that because that it is the greatest Taanug, pleasure in the whole of existence just to come closer and closer to Hashem. That closeness to Hashem is the greatest gift, the greatest pleasure that we could ever know. Those who have no inkling  what a tremendous gift from Shomayim this spiritual closeness to Hashem means, when they find themselves without their cars, without their makeup, without their Sheitels, without their tight clothes, without their movies, without their iPhones, and so on, they’ll think that they are in Gehenom. They’ll run away and disappear into nothingness. Oy Am Yisroel, Am Yisroel let’s go together, together all of us. Let us get ready together to walk into the world of Moshiach Tzidkainu, to the Olam Habah of Moshiach. We now have time to get ready for the greatest salvation, The Yeshuah Sheleimah. Remember very few will survive.

Tatti: Why did this tragedy happen in the United States of America?

Moishela: The United States of America since its creation in 1776 has become the greatest nation in the world. There was never as much Gashmius in any country in the world as the Gashmius achieved for almost every citizen in the United States of America. However because of that Gashmius people are dying and The United States of America is dying. It’s not going to be the stars and stripes forever any more. Its finished. One man walked in, took over the presidency, the last of a chain of traitors to the American ideal and is destroying the Unites States of America systematically. However this is the punishment for the Egel Hazahav that they so believed in. The American public became decadent and they became wild and they became without bounds and this is all because of this terrible Gashmius. But worst of all it has affected the Frum community in the most terrible way in the most terrible way.  

Most of the Yidden that are Frum (I am not talking about the non-Frum because they have been really affected in the most horrible way, worse than the Chareidim), the Chareidim have taken this Egel Hazahav and placed it next to the Torah, Shelo Naida. We’ve turned much of our Yiddishkeit into Goyishkeit but we still wear Tzitzis and we still put on Tefillin and we still keep Shabbos and Kashrus. The standards, however are extremely low in most cases and it has become just a Churban, a Churban Habayis. This plastic Yiddishkeit has been exported to the whole world from the United States of America and therefore it’s time that the Yidden in America that do want the truth, start looking for it and not be embarrassed or afraid of what the society is going to say about them.

Tatti: Why did the tragic reminder happen to innocent children?

Moishela: The children were taken because they are the purest. The children are the purest pure sacrifices. It grabs everybody’s heart. It tells people that we better shape up. We better start thinking. If it was someone eighty years old or even fifty years old or even twenty years old it wouldn’t have the same effect on us. However these pure sweet little children dying in such a horrible way, that catches our attention. Nothing else catches our attention. We’ve become very cold and calculated in our Gashmius direction.

And I want to tell you that I’m so glad that long ago we moved here, because if not I cannot tell you for sure if we wouldn’t also be Korbonos, Chas Vesholom. I want to tell you something else. We are a good example of what I was talking about. We were also caught with the Egel Hazahav. We came to Eretz Yisroel for idealistic purposes and Boruch Hashem from almost the moment that we got here, we started to change for the better. I wasn’t yet in this world when you came, but in spirit I was. I knew that I would have a job here with you and Boruch Hashem you came in time, just in time thirteen and a half years ago, just the right time. The symbol of the gates opening, leading us to this time in history was the destruction of the Twin Towers. When the Twin Towers were destroyed, it was to show that Hashem was declaring war on the Egel Hazahav.  The Twin Towers were the greatest representation at that time of the Olam Hazeh. 

I thank Hashem for sending us here. I thank Hashem that I was born in Eretz Yisroel and even though the Egel Hazahav is flourishing here in Eretz Hakodesh still the Shechina and the Kedusha is available to any Yid that wishes to connect to it and this is not in accessible to us in any other place in the world. I thank Hashem also that we don’t have to be Korbonos and I Daven very much that our family together with all Am Yisroel will be Zoche to greet Moshiach Tzidkainu, Im Yirtzeh Hashem. Then nobody will be handicapped not me, not anybody, not in body, and not in soul, not me, not anybody!]]></description>

Discussion with Moishela (with his family)
A Handicapped child 5775 #3
20 Kislev 5775 (Dec 11, ‘14)

(from: http://ladaat.info/showgil.aspx?par=20141227&#038;gil=1713)

“Why Are We Living”

Time is moving on and we are definitely getting very close to the Geula Shelaima. I think every true Jew, whether he is close to Hashem or a bit farther away, feels now is the time that the world is going to change completely. The Frum, the believing Jew will feel a kind of closeness to Hashem that he never felt before, even though every morning when he gets up he can feel a strange and frightening foreboding of what’s going to be in the future.

The Jew that is not so close to Hashem will also feel the fear and he will start thinking what this life is about. What do I have? What are my goals? What does it matter if I go to a football game or not? What does it matter if I get the job exactly that I want or get into the right university just right for me? What does it matter? What really matters in this life? All the entertainment? All the social life? What is life all about? Why are we living? Is it just one big accident, Chas Vesholom, an accident that brought us into life against our will to suffer, Chas Vesholom? The fear of what’s coming in the near future together with the suffering that we are already going through, are bringing some people, some Jews to question, at least to stop for a moment from their partying to ask what is this about, why is this happening.

These questions are not usually asked here in Eretz Yisroel because we are used here in Eretz Yisroel to go through many crisis and then the crisis disappears and we continue going on. Of course a certain amount of people are killed Shelo Naida and so on and so forth, but the ones that are left are the great majority and they can continue on with the life that they left, the life of enjoyment, of entertainment, of flying off to Europe, to Thailand, to who knows where, and enjoying themselves. As for the Frum we continue with our grand Bar Mitzvas and weddings and our own type of social entertainment. We continue with our restaurants, of course the most kosher, and all our entertainments with the best Hechsherim, our non-Tzniusdik dress with the best Hechsherim, and so on and so forth. Now however many people feel inside that we are not going to come out of this frightening projection of future events so easily. It’s not just going to pass.

There is going to be a tremendous change in the world, a tremendous change that will in the end destroy much of the world, and therefore there are those, that are starting to feel great fear, have bad dreams, unnerving dreams and wake up very many times with a choking feeling with a fear that grabs a person and makes it difficult to breathe, a fear that makes a person want to jump up out of bed and feel alive again and this is all from the fear and the spiritual pressure of the world that is about to explode, a world that is about to change completely. This world of ours is going to disappear the way it is now, and we must change also, so that we can survive the greatest change since the creation of the world. All the dire predictions that are being made for the near future should be taken seriously if we want to be part of what’s going to be, be part of the Geula Shelaima, and a much more spiritual life. We have to become close to Hashem. We have to do Hashem’s will. We have to be Yidden the way we are supposed to be.

We must! We must do Hashem’s will completely in every aspect, to bend ourselves completely to Hashem, to His Ratzon. Otherwise we will never be able to go into the new world of Moshiach Tzidkainu.

I’ve many times spoken to you again and again on the subject, and maybe you are tired of hearing this even though I’ve tried saying it in a different way each time to make you understand better and better. I will try again anyway. I will try to make you understand that this is a great year. This year is a great and frightening year. This year is when many things will change in the greatest way. The wars have already begun. Blood is flowing freely. We are not even impressed anymore when the barbarians cut people’s heads off, but we are terribly disturbed or will be terribly disturbed when we won’t be able to get a kosher hamburger or coca cola or just plain food. We will be terribly disturbed when we see great cities falling, destroyed together with their population, Shelo Naida, all disappearing.

We will be greatly disturbed to say the least. How will we be able to overcome our feelings? How will we be able to get through all of this because even if we don’t actually see this happening next to us it will be such a shock when we know so many people in those places and even if we don’t know them still it will be a shock. It will be a terrible shock. I don’t think that any generation before ours since the Creation, except for of course Sedom and Ammorah experienced such a thing, such a catastrophe, such a horrible terrible type of destruction. Even in Sedom and Ammorah it wasn’t the size of what’s going to be now. It’s dwarfed next to what’s going to be now. Don’t you understand? There will be plenty of bloodshed here in Eretz Yisroel, Shelo Naida, but it won’t be destroyed. Those that are far from Hashem and don’t have the Zechus to come back to Hashem will be destroyed with the buildings, will be destroyed with the Edomites and the Yishmaelites and all other peoples that don’t accept Hakodosh Boruch Hu as their Creator. So what do we have to do? How can we get through all of this? We have to believe completely that whatever Hashem does is for our good, no matter what.

There is only one relationship in this world. It is the person with Hakodosh Boruch Hu. That may sound difficult for you because you have children, you have husbands, you have wives that you love very much. True, but when push comes to shove we are only the children of Hakodosh Boruch Hu, all of us, and we have been in many Gilgulim here in this world and in every Gilgul we might have had a different husband, a different wife, children not always the same, and we have had different situations that we had to overcome. We are so low and now is our chance finally to pull ourselves up and come back.

When we get to the point where we greet Moshiach, Be’ezras Hashem, don’t worry. Every Neshoma will have its true, true Zivig and every child will know its true parents, and we all will know and feel and have no question about the fact that we as a people have only one Father and that is Hakodosh Boruch Hu, and our whole lives, our whole beings will be involved in only one occupation coming closer and closer to Him. In order to come closer to Him we will eventually drop all our flesh and blood characteristics and become totally, totally spiritual and become one with Him.

Lately we have seen many tragedies. Tonight one of the Bochurim that was killed in the tragic car accident in Holland was buried. He has a very special name, Langleben, “a long life”. May he have a long life, a life of eternity, he was a Bochur that was working to be close to Hashem as was the other boy that was killed. Both trying their best to be good Jews, trying to do what Hashem wants us to do.

Why did they have to die? I can’t answer you why these particular ones had to die, but I can tell you this that the latest tragedies are a message to us that we must, must do Teshuva, and realize what we are doing wrong. When Hashem brings down so many tragedies on Am Yisroel at one time we must stop and think and take stock of our lives of what we may be doing wrong.

There was a terrible incident in Crown Heights also, and lately there have been many tragedies all over the Frum Jewish world Shelo Naidah. We must open our eyes and try to figure out where we are going wrong. It’s not a pat on the back for us. It’s a Potsh in the face for us so we will wake up.

So please understand that Hashem is not happy. He wants to save His Am, but generally speaking we are going in the wrong direction. Am Yisroel you better wake up! Stop the Machlokes. Stop the Pritzus. Stop the running after the Gashmius. Stop the gluttony and come back to what’s real. The only thing that is real is Hakodosh Boruch Hu and His Torah.]]></description>

A Handicapped child 5775 #3<br />
20 Kislev 5775 (Dec 11, ‘14)</p>
<p>(from: <a href="http://ladaat.info/showgil.aspx?par=20141227&#038;gil=1713" rel="nofollow">http://ladaat.info/showgil.aspx?par=20141227&#038;gil=1713</a>)</p>
<p>“Why Are We Living”</p>
<p>Time is moving on and we are definitely getting very close to the Geula Shelaima. I think every true Jew, whether he is close to Hashem or a bit farther away, feels now is the time that the world is going to change completely. The Frum, the believing Jew will feel a kind of closeness to Hashem that he never felt before, even though every morning when he gets up he can feel a strange and frightening foreboding of what’s going to be in the future.</p>
<p>The Jew that is not so close to Hashem will also feel the fear and he will start thinking what this life is about. What do I have? What are my goals? What does it matter if I go to a football game or not? What does it matter if I get the job exactly that I want or get into the right university just right for me? What does it matter? What really matters in this life? All the entertainment? All the social life? What is life all about? Why are we living? Is it just one big accident, Chas Vesholom, an accident that brought us into life against our will to suffer, Chas Vesholom? The fear of what’s coming in the near future together with the suffering that we are already going through, are bringing some people, some Jews to question, at least to stop for a moment from their partying to ask what is this about, why is this happening.</p>
<p>These questions are not usually asked here in Eretz Yisroel because we are used here in Eretz Yisroel to go through many crisis and then the crisis disappears and we continue going on. Of course a certain amount of people are killed Shelo Naida and so on and so forth, but the ones that are left are the great majority and they can continue on with the life that they left, the life of enjoyment, of entertainment, of flying off to Europe, to Thailand, to who knows where, and enjoying themselves. As for the Frum we continue with our grand Bar Mitzvas and weddings and our own type of social entertainment. We continue with our restaurants, of course the most kosher, and all our entertainments with the best Hechsherim, our non-Tzniusdik dress with the best Hechsherim, and so on and so forth. Now however many people feel inside that we are not going to come out of this frightening projection of future events so easily. It’s not just going to pass.</p>
<p>There is going to be a tremendous change in the world, a tremendous change that will in the end destroy much of the world, and therefore there are those, that are starting to feel great fear, have bad dreams, unnerving dreams and wake up very many times with a choking feeling with a fear that grabs a person and makes it difficult to breathe, a fear that makes a person want to jump up out of bed and feel alive again and this is all from the fear and the spiritual pressure of the world that is about to explode, a world that is about to change completely. This world of ours is going to disappear the way it is now, and we must change also, so that we can survive the greatest change since the creation of the world. All the dire predictions that are being made for the near future should be taken seriously if we want to be part of what’s going to be, be part of the Geula Shelaima, and a much more spiritual life. We have to become close to Hashem. We have to do Hashem’s will. We have to be Yidden the way we are supposed to be.</p>
<p>We must! We must do Hashem’s will completely in every aspect, to bend ourselves completely to Hashem, to His Ratzon. Otherwise we will never be able to go into the new world of Moshiach Tzidkainu.</p>
<p>I’ve many times spoken to you again and again on the subject, and maybe you are tired of hearing this even though I’ve tried saying it in a different way each time to make you understand better and better. I will try again anyway. I will try to make you understand that this is a great year. This year is a great and frightening year. This year is when many things will change in the greatest way. The wars have already begun. Blood is flowing freely. We are not even impressed anymore when the barbarians cut people’s heads off, but we are terribly disturbed or will be terribly disturbed when we won’t be able to get a kosher hamburger or coca cola or just plain food. We will be terribly disturbed when we see great cities falling, destroyed together with their population, Shelo Naida, all disappearing.</p>

“You Better Get Serious”

Oy, oy, oy, what a tragedy what a terrible tragedy. Choshuva Yidden, not just Stam Yidden, slain in the cruelest way while standing Davening to Hashem. It could theoretically happen to any one of us, Chas Vesholom. The sight of the bodies full of blood wrapped in their Talaisim and their Tefillin, Tzaddikim slaughtered in front of the eyes of their friends, what could be more tragic than that? But everything is a message to Am Yisroel, and this too is a message. This too is a message that we have to try very hard not to ignore. We have to try very hard to understand every aspect of the message and perform what we have to perform, to do what we have to do.
Let’s discuss it. These giants that were killed, these Tzaddikim that were killed only because they were Jews and for no other reason, wrapped in their Talis and their Tefillin in the middle of Davening to Hakodosh Boruch Hu,]]></description>

Discussion with Moishela (with his family)

A Handicapped child

16 Elul 5774 (Sept 10, ‘14)

I Have Been Given Permission to Reveal to you Future Events

Oy Mommy, Oy Tatti, what can I tell you? I’m sorry that I have made you in the last few weeks a little bit unnerved, but I must admit that the world is changing at the speed of sound, and from day to day or from minute to minute, we don’t know what’s going to be. We used to live in a world that was at least semi organized. We could predict, sometimes anyway, what the next day or the next minute might bring. Today we are all confused, never knowing where another tragedy, Shelo Naida, another bang will come from. Tatti, Mommy, the next few weeks are going to be very, very frightening. The next few weeks will be full of changes that will make our heads spin, changes all over the world, frightening changes and also frightening happenings.

By the time we get to Rosh Hashana we are going to all be in a somber mood, a mood for Davening very hard, for begging Hashem to save us and declaring Him our King. So we must prepare ourselves not to be too blown away by the happenings of the near future and always remember the only way to steady ourselves and keep ourselves in a state that we can overcome spiritually and physically the times to come, is by holding on to Hakodosh Boruch Hu, so-to-speak, holding on to the rope, spiritual rope that connects us Am Yisroel to our Creator. So as I said, in the next few weeks until Rosh Hashana there will be amazing new news for all of us, for the whole world and there will be news that people will not understand. They will stand and wonder what in the world is going on, but as time goes on we will realize what the plan of the evil ones really is.

After Rosh Hashana during the Aseres Yimei Teshuva will be a time of gathering our strengths together and crying to Hashem like we have never cried before. By the time that Yom Kippur comes around, I’m afraid that our tears might have been spent already from worrying what’s going to be, and we will try to squeeze out a few more in order to try to save ourselves. By the time Succos comes we will be quite worn out for our efforts, and I believe that Succos, at least for a short time, will bring a semblance of balance, a semblance of joy in the Yom Tov, but Simchas Torah will bring us back to the cruel reality, and we will dance with the Torah with tears in our eyes. We will hold the Torah close to us so it can’t separate from us, so we won’t separate from it. We will dance and we will dance and we will beg Hashem through our dancing to always keep us close to Him, and we will keep the Torah close to us, and when Simchas Torah is over the real wars will begin.

Am Yisroel you know that there is something in my words. In the last two or three years you have seen such crazy tragic things happening. We know that the world has become an insane asylum and as Harav Dessler put it the people taking care of the inmates are the inmates themselves. So it’s a world of the mentally ill. There are some Jews which do try to separate themselves from the Sheker, from the lie and on those few Jews the world of the Geula Shelaima will be built by Hashem. We Am Yisroel must hold on and never let go.

We will go farther. After Succos, Simchas Torah the world will become so so different, so horribly different that it will be absolutely unrecognizable. The only thing we will recognize is our Kesher with Hashem. The only thing that will be real will be our Kesher with Hashem, His Torah, and His Mitzvos.

Am Yisroel, the ones in Chutz Laretz, the ones outside of Eretz Yisroel, pack your bags if you can. Pack your bags and come. Do so. It’s not an Aveirah. Coming to Eretz Yisroel is a great Zechus, but don’t come if you don’t really want to go higher in your Yiddishkeit. Don’t come just to save your lives, because it won’t work. You have to believe, believe that Hashem is Hakol Yachol. Ain Od Milvado. You have to believe it with all your heart and your soul. You have to believe that there is nothing greater than our Torah. You have to believe that Moshiach is going to come and there is going to be Techias Hameisim and you have to believe in every single one of the Yud Gimmel Ikrim. You must believe in that. That is your ticket to eternity. You must with all your heart and soul believe in it.

After Simchas Torah there is going to be a giant Birur and that Birur is going to be very hard, but it won’t be hard for those who understand the Truth, for those who cling to Hashem, for those who cling to the Truth. It won’t be hard. So please Am Yisroel please, please if you feel up to it, if you feel that you want to rise spiritually, come to Eretz Yisroel, not Medinas Yisroel, that’s going to fall very soon, but Eretz Yisroel, come to Eretz Yisroel, and even though it could be very difficult and even though you don’t know where you are going to live and even though you don’t know where your income will come from, still you are better off here than there if you truly want to be close to Hashem. If you truly want, for spiritual reasons to come close to Hakodosh Boruch Hu, to actually greet Moshiach Tzidkainu then come to Eretz Yisroel now. Anyone with Gashmiusdik ideas about the Geula, forget it. Stay where you are.

I also want to reiterate that every Jewish soul will be saved. Every Jewish soul that stood at Har Sinai and said Na’ase Venishma, we will do and we will say, every Jewish soul will be saved. Hashem will make sure that even if a Jew thinks he doesn’t accept Emes, in the end he will. Hashem will force him to accept Emes, and he will become a great believer, but he will suffer on the way, but those who are close already, those who believe with all their hearts and souls in Hakol Yachol, in Hakodosh Boruch Hu, in the Ribbono Shel Olam, they will not have difficulties almost at all. It might be frightening to see what’s happening, but they themselves will not suffer. So Am Yisroel, we are coming to Rosh Hashana. Please do Teshuva. Please do Teshuva now. Get your heads straight. Get your minds on the right things. Teach your children how to react when the terrible wars really start. They have started already, but the really bad part is soon to come. Teach your children how to hold on to Hashem. Teach your children what reality is, what the Geula Shelaima means, what the Bais Hamikdosh means, what the Korbanos mean. Teach them not to be afraid because Hashem is Hakol Yachol. He took us out of Mitzrayim, which was an amazing, amazing Ness, and He will take us out of this terrible, terrible Golus and bring us to the Geula Shelaima.

I want to tell you something else Mommy and Tatti. I love you all very much. I know how much you are doing for me and how you care for me. I know I sometimes make you both a bit upset with my moods. I go a bit crazy myself with the double life that I have been living. One part of my life, a little boy with little boy needs, and the other part of my life I am a greater person a much more adult person. So please I ask you Mechila for anything I have done to make it difficult for you and tell you how much I appreciate how you’ve taken care of me, and how I imagine you will continue to take care of me up to when Moshiach comes. At that time I won’t need your help anymore, Be’ezras Hashem. I know that very soon we are going to see the Truth. So don’t get discouraged and don’t get taken down. Just know that all of our troubles are going to disappear and really you shouldn’t be worried about all these things that are happening in the house, buying and selling apartments, taking care of me, and all the other grandchildren who have this problem, that problem, or the other problem, or my aunts and my uncles that have all kinds of problems. Just know that it’s almost over, almost over.

To Am Yisroel I want to tell you that when we come to Chanukah we are going to have very great spiritual happenings that will remind us of the Maccabim, that will remind us of our greatness, will remind us of our Bais Hamikdosh, even though we will be very frightened and we will be such a tiny little group surrounded by huge amounts of wild people with terrible weapons, but still our hearts will be full of joy because we will feel again what the Maccabim felt even though we will be terribly afraid. It will seem impossible to ever get out of that situation, but Hashem will help us and we will, and after that will come Asara B’teves and we will mourn like we never mourned before. We will cry and beg like we never did on Tisha B’av, beg and beg Hashem to rebuild our Bayis our Bais Hamikdosh, and not let the Goyim do the most outlandish thing of destroying the Dome of the Rock and instead building Chas Veshalom there a temple to the Avodah Zorah of their new Religion Chas Vesholom, Yemach Shemam Vezichram. That is their plan to build on top of Har Hamoriah, Har Habayis a temple to the Avodah Zorahs, the worst Avodah Zorahs.

Then we will come to Purim and we will beg Hashem to save us from Haman and we will have a Haman here, a Haman that we will have to be saved from and we will have to fight, fight our fears, beg Hashem to save us from this awful terrible horrific person and his armies and his police. We will have to beg very hard. Hashem will save us.

He will save us, and then will come Pesach and we will be a tattered bunch of tired people when we sit around the Seder table, with Matzoh and wine miraculously provided for us by Hashem and we will beg Hashem to save us. We will beg Hashem. We will beg Hashem to bring the Geula Shelaima. On Shvii Shel Pesach we will hear the Shofar. We will hear the Shofar and on Leil Haseder each house will see Eliyahu Hanavi, all the Jews that are Emesdik will see him and it will give us strength, but it still won’t be the time of redemption. I can’t go on farther than that to explain, but when we see Eliyahu Hanavi we will know that very soon this terribly long Golus will be over, and we will be finally free. From that moment on, there will be more and greater wars. There will be false prophets and false messiahs, but we will hold on to Hakodosh Boruch Hu and to the seed of Dovid Hamelech, to our Moshiach Tzidkainu, our true Moshiach. He will reveal himself and we Motzai Shviis will walk into the Bais Hamikdosh and be Makriv Korbonos and be happy and be dancing with the greatest joy ever felt in the whole world, even though around us two thirds of the world will have been destroyed, and very few Yidden and even fewer Goyim will survive.

I have been given permission to reveal to you these future events in order to give Am Yisroel strength and courage to get through these very difficult times. I beg Am Yisroel from the bottom of my heart to feel that every Jew is responsible for the other Jew. Every true Jew feels responsibility for another Jew, feels that he wants to do Chessed for another Jew. That’s how you know he’s really a Jew. I love Am Yisroel so much that just saying it makes me cry, and I beg you please make it easy on yourselves. Come back to Hashem. Take away the Gashmius which is so senseless, all the toys, all the adult stupid toys, all the videos, all the things that make us waste our time and instead put our efforts into growing spiritually. The best way to grow spiritually is when times are difficult. We don’t want times to be difficult, but we must use the future hard times to help us grow. Please let us put our hearts and our souls and our strength, into growing even though around us will be death and destruction. Please keep growing. Please keep coming closer and closer to Hakodosh Boruch Hu.

Q: Do we have to be afraid of the ISIS?

A: That group of murderers were created by the Reshoim to frighten the world. They have no real tangible strength. It’s all a farce and the Europeans definitely don’t want them around and probably will try to get rid of them as fast as possible. However they will go underground and they will cause destruction in the world because they as individuals can blow up hundreds of places in Europe, America, not only the Mideast. As an army they aren’t an army. They are just a group of vicious people. They are using the scare tactics of chopping peoples’ heads off, Lo Aleinu, or murdering them in other terrible ways to make people afraid, but don’t pay attention to them. It’s all not something real. Yes people are killed and they are very vicious, but they have no strength and Hashem will destroy them.

There is nothing to add right now. I’m giving you kind of a preview. Up to now we the autistics, have written many things and they’ve all come true, however, we never really gave a timeframe because people still had to schlep through many years without this kind of Chizuk. There was no point in giving a timeframe, because people would say, “Oh well we still have ten years, so let’s just party until then. We have time to do Teshuvah!” There’s no time now, so let’s do it now now, now!

There is one more thing I want to say. In the next near future the State of Israel, the Medina is going to crumble. It’s already crumbling from its own decadence. That is what’s going to happen IY”H. Very soon the chaos is going to rage here until the Goyim take over. Then Moshiach will take control from the Goyim and the Geula Shelaima will begin Be’ezras Hashem..]]></description>

Today we are all confused, never knowing where another tragedy, Shelo Naida, another bang will come from. Tatti, Mommy, the next few weeks are going to be very, very frightening. The next few weeks will be full of changes that will make our heads spin, changes all over the world, frightening changes and also frightening happenings.</p>
<p>By the time we get to Rosh Hashana we are going to all be in a somber mood, a mood for Davening very hard, for begging Hashem to save us and declaring Him our King. So we must prepare ourselves not to be too blown away by the happenings of the near future and always remember the only way to steady ourselves and keep ourselves in a state that we can overcome spiritually and physically the times to come, is by holding on to Hakodosh Boruch Hu, so-to-speak, holding on to the rope, spiritual rope that connects us Am Yisroel to our Creator. So as I said, in the next few weeks until Rosh Hashana there will be amazing new news for all of us, for the whole world and there will be news that people will not understand. They will stand and wonder what in the world is going on, but as time goes on we will realize what the plan of the evil ones really is.</p>
<p>After Rosh Hashana during the Aseres Yimei Teshuva will be a time of gathering our strengths together and crying to Hashem like we have never cried before. By the time that Yom Kippur comes around, I’m afraid that our tears might have been spent already from worrying what’s going to be, and we will try to squeeze out a few more in order to try to save ourselves. By the time Succos comes we will be quite worn out for our efforts, and I believe that Succos, at least for a short time, will bring a semblance of balance, a semblance of joy in the Yom Tov, but Simchas Torah will bring us back to the cruel reality, and we will dance with the Torah with tears in our eyes. We will hold the Torah close to us so it can’t separate from us, so we won’t separate from it. We will dance and we will dance and we will beg Hashem through our dancing to always keep us close to Him, and we will keep the Torah close to us, and when Simchas Torah is over the real wars will begin.</p>
<p>Am Yisroel you know that there is something in my words. In the last two or three years you have seen such crazy tragic things happening. We know that the world has become an insane asylum and as Harav Dessler put it the people taking care of the inmates are the inmates themselves. So it’s a world of the mentally ill. There are some Jews which do try to separate themselves from the Sheker, from the lie and on those few Jews the world of the Geula Shelaima will be built by Hashem. We Am Yisroel must hold on and never let go.</p>
<p>We will go farther. After Succos, Simchas Torah the world will become so so different, so horribly different that it will be absolutely unrecognizable. The only thing we will recognize is our Kesher with Hashem. The only thing that will be real will be our Kesher with Hashem, His Torah, and His Mitzvos.</p>
<p>Am Yisroel, the ones in Chutz Laretz, the ones outside of Eretz Yisroel, pack your bags if you can. Pack your bags and come. Do so. It’s not an Aveirah. Coming to Eretz Yisroel is a great Zechus, but don’t come if you don’t really want to go higher in your Yiddishkeit. Don’t come just to save your lives, because it won’t work. You have to believe, believe that Hashem is Hakol Yachol. Ain Od Milvado. You have to believe it with all your heart and your soul. You have to believe that there is nothing greater than our Torah. You have to believe that Moshiach is going to come and there is going to be Techias Hameisim and you have to believe in every single one of the Yud Gimmel Ikrim. You must believe in that. That is your ticket to eternity. You must with all your heart and soul believe in it.</p>
<p>After Simchas Torah there is going to be a giant Birur and that Birur is going to be very hard, but it won’t be hard for those who understand the Truth, for those who cling to Hashem, for those who cling to the Truth. It won’t be hard. So please Am Yisroel please, please if you feel up to it, if you feel that you want to rise spiritually, come to Eretz Yisroel, not Medinas Yisroel, that’s going to fall very soon, but Eretz Yisroel, come to Eretz Yisroel, and even though it could be very difficult and even though you don’t know where you are going to live and even though you don’t know where your income will come from, still you are better off here than there if you truly want to be close to Hashem. If you truly want, for spiritual reasons to come close to Hakodosh Boruch Hu, to actually greet Moshiach Tzidkainu then come to Eretz Yisroel now. Anyone with Gashmiusdik ideas about the Geula, forget it. Stay where you are.</p>
<p>I also want to reiterate that every Jewish soul will be saved. Every Jewish soul that stood at Har Sinai and said Na’ase Venishma, we will do and we will say, every Jewish soul will be saved. Hashem will make sure that even if a Jew thinks he doesn’t accept Emes, in the end he will. Hashem will force him to accept Emes, and he will become a great believer, but he will suffer on the way, but those who are close already, those who believe with all their hearts and souls in Hakol Yachol, in Hakodosh Boruch Hu, in the Ribbono Shel Olam, they will not have difficulties almost at all. It might be frightening to see what’s happening, but they themselves will not suffer. So Am Yisroel, we are coming to Rosh Hashana. Please do Teshuva. Please do Teshuva now. Get your heads straight. Get your minds on the right things. Teach your children how to react when the terrible wars really start. They have started already, but the really bad part is soon to come. Teach your children how to hold on to Hashem. Teach your children what reality is, what the Geula Shelaima means, what the Bais Hamikdosh means, what the Korbanos mean. Teach them not to be afraid because Hashem is Hakol Yachol. He took us out of Mitzrayim, which was an amazing, amazing Ness, and He will take us out of this terrible, terrible Golus and bring us to the Geula Shelaima.</p>
<p>I want to tell you something else Mommy and Tatti. I love you all very much. I know how much you are doing for me and how you care for me. I know I sometimes make you both a bit upset with my moods. I go a bit crazy myself with the double life that I have been living. One part of my life, a little boy with little boy needs, and the other part of my life I am a greater person a much more adult person. So please I ask you Mechila for anything I have done to make it difficult for you and tell you how much I appreciate how you’ve taken care of me, and how I imagine you will continue to take care of me up to when Moshiach comes. At that time I won’t need your help anymore, Be’ezras Hashem. I know that very soon we are going to see the Truth. So don’t get discouraged and don’t get taken down. Just know that all of our troubles are going to disappear and really you shouldn’t be worried about all these things that are happening in the house, buying and selling apartments, taking care of me, and all the other grandchildren who have this problem, that problem, or the other problem, or my aunts and my uncles that have all kinds of problems. Just know that it’s almost over, almost over.</p>
<p>To Am Yisroel I want to tell you that when we come to Chanukah we are going to have very great spiritual happenings that will remind us of the Maccabim, that will remind us of our greatness, will remind us of our Bais Hamikdosh, even though we will be very frightened and we will be such a tiny little group surrounded by huge amounts of wild people with terrible weapons, but still our hearts will be full of joy because we will feel again what the Maccabim felt even though we will be terribly afraid. It will seem impossible to ever get out of that situation, but Hashem will help us and we will, and after that will come Asara B’teves and we will mourn like we never mourned before. We will cry and beg like we never did on Tisha B’av, beg and beg Hashem to rebuild our Bayis our Bais Hamikdosh, and not let the Goyim do the most outlandish thing of destroying the Dome of the Rock and instead building Chas Veshalom there a temple to the Avodah Zorah of their new Religion Chas Vesholom, Yemach Shemam Vezichram. That is their plan to build on top of Har Hamoriah, Har Habayis a temple to the Avodah Zorahs, the worst Avodah Zorahs.</p>
<p>Then we will come to Purim and we will beg Hashem to save us from Haman and we will have a Haman here, a Haman that we will have to be saved from and we will have to fight, fight our fears, beg Hashem to save us from this awful terrible horrific person and his armies and his police. We will have to beg very hard. Hashem will save us.</p>
<p>He will save us, and then will come Pesach and we will be a tattered bunch of tired people when we sit around the Seder table, with Matzoh and wine miraculously provided for us by Hashem and we will beg Hashem to save us. We will beg Hashem. We will beg Hashem to bring the Geula Shelaima. On Shvii Shel Pesach we will hear the Shofar. We will hear the Shofar and on Leil Haseder each house will see Eliyahu Hanavi, all the Jews that are Emesdik will see him and it will give us strength, but it still won’t be the time of redemption. I can’t go on farther than that to explain, but when we see Eliyahu Hanavi we will know that very soon this terribly long Golus will be over, and we will be finally free. From that moment on, there will be more and greater wars. There will be false prophets and false messiahs, but we will hold on to Hakodosh Boruch Hu and to the seed of Dovid Hamelech, to our Moshiach Tzidkainu, our true Moshiach. He will reveal himself and we Motzai Shviis will walk into the Bais Hamikdosh and be Makriv Korbonos and be happy and be dancing with the greatest joy ever felt in the whole world, even though around us two thirds of the world will have been destroyed, and very few Yidden and even fewer Goyim will survive.</p>
<p>I have been given permission to reveal to you these future events in order to give Am Yisroel strength and courage to get through these very difficult times. I beg Am Yisroel from the bottom of my heart to feel that every Jew is responsible for the other Jew. Every true Jew feels responsibility for another Jew, feels that he wants to do Chessed for another Jew. That’s how you know he’s really a Jew. I love Am Yisroel so much that just saying it makes me cry, and I beg you please make it easy on yourselves. Come back to Hashem. Take away the Gashmius which is so senseless, all the toys, all the adult stupid toys, all the videos, all the things that make us waste our time and instead put our efforts into growing spiritually. The best way to grow spiritually is when times are difficult. We don’t want times to be difficult, but we must use the future hard times to help us grow. Please let us put our hearts and our souls and our strength, into growing even though around us will be death and destruction. Please keep growing. Please keep coming closer and closer to Hakodosh Boruch Hu.</p>
<p>Q: Do we have to be afraid of the ISIS?</p>
<p>A: That group of murderers were created by the Reshoim to frighten the world. They have no real tangible strength. It’s all a farce and the Europeans definitely don’t want them around and probably will try to get rid of them as fast as possible. However they will go underground and they will cause destruction in the world because they as individuals can blow up hundreds of places in Europe, America, not only the Mideast. As an army they aren’t an army. They are just a group of vicious people. They are using the scare tactics of chopping peoples’ heads off, Lo Aleinu, or murdering them in other terrible ways to make people afraid, but don’t pay attention to them. It’s all not something real. Yes people are killed and they are very vicious, but they have no strength and Hashem will destroy them.</p>
<p>There is nothing to add right now. I’m giving you kind of a preview. Up to now we the autistics, have written many things and they’ve all come true, however, we never really gave a timeframe because people still had to schlep through many years without this kind of Chizuk. There was no point in giving a timeframe, because people would say, “Oh well we still have ten years, so let’s just party until then. We have time to do Teshuvah!” There’s no time now, so let’s do it now now, now!</p>
<p>There is one more thing I want to say. In the next near future the State of Israel, the Medina is going to crumble. It’s already crumbling from its own decadence. That is what’s going to happen IY”H. Very soon the chaos is going to rage here until the Goyim take over. Then Moshiach will take control from the Goyim and the Geula Shelaima will begin Be’ezras Hashem..</p>

		<description><![CDATA[It is machlokes Rishonim if the Gemara is talking about what you can&#039;t look at while saying krias shema or what you can&#039;t look at (even without intent for pleasure) when the woman in question has the status of erva to you.  According to some Rishonim it is both.  However, either way it is based on a chashash of hirhur (improper thoughts) or maybe (according to some) in the case of the thigh, because m&#039;drabbanan they gave the thigh the status of erva mamesh.  

The Rishonim also seem to differentiate between the thigh and hair/voice (the posuk calls the thigh &quot;erva&quot; it merely describes hair and voice in pleasurable terms).  

The din of ervas davar that you are referring to, however, is only with respect to the actual genitilia and refers to even one&#039;s own erva.]]></description>

Wrong. Chazal wore skirt like things that reached their knees or so. I have davened in shorts quite often, especially in the heat of summer.

&lt;i&gt;and shoes&lt;/i&gt;



Wrong. Chazal also wore sandals and so did everyone else for centuries after that. I and thousands of others wear sandals when davening at the kotel!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think that is the pshat in the Gemara.

For that we bring proofs from Navi. But those proofs aren&#039;t derabanan, they are a gilui milsah to what is ervah d&#039;oraysa (similar to Bava Kama 2b by keren).

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;There are two Judaisms. There is the Judaism between Jew and God and there is the Judaism between Jew and fellow Jew. They are not always the same thing.&quot;

Rabbi Berel Wein tries to unify both realms in an article he wrote on Parshas Kedoshim on Jewish World Review.com( “How to be holy”) :

“According to the popularization of Freudian psychology it is the sexual drive more than anything else that is the energy source for human behavior…In effect, the Torah teaches us that our sexual drive is a neutral commodity. It is rather the circumstances and structure that surround the use of this drive that determine its probity, correctness and holiness. That is the key idea that lies behind all of the commandments that appear in these chapters — discipline, sensitivity, correctness of behavior and a sense of positive purpose. 

…But of equal importance is the correct relationship between humans and their fellow human beings. One cannot be a holy person through ritual piety and scholarship alone. Ramban advances the idea that the possibility of being obnoxious and disgusting even within the confines of the Torah, so to speak, exists…The Torah prescribes the same formula for dealing with others as it did for dealing with our innate drives as described
above — patience, sensitivity, self-discipline and retention of the goal of being holy.

…The Torah is always to be viewed as a unity, as something whole and inseparable. That is the way to embark on the road to holiness”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s very self-centered not to be able to understand that others aren&#039;t the same as you.  I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the cause of insularity (because people want to avoid others who are different), or the effect, but it&#039;s pernicious.

Do you really find it difficult to understand that God is not central to some people&#039;s lives?  Surely you understand that atheists exist?  The only reason you believe in God is because you were indoctrinated to do so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;frum people automatically assume that people who do non-frum things are doing them &quot;lehach&#039;is&quot;, when it&#039;s almost never the case.&lt;/i&gt;

This one I can understand. For frum people, God is ever central; Everything you do is related to God, every time you eat something you make a bracha, every time you wake up, you have a routine of actions that are related to God, every time you get dressed, you make sure it is appropriate, etc. And if God is ever central, for all hours of the day, then when you see others doing things that you consider to be not permitted, you can only conclude that they too are thinking of God while they do it ... and thus is has to be l&#039;hachis.



What we frum find difficult to understand is that for many people, God is not ever present in their lives. Even worse, some frum people can&#039;t even understand that other frum people can understand this fact. &#060;== tough sentence to parse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would also argue that choosing to wear clothing that &quot;looks good&quot;, or that you think &quot;looks good&quot;, is also not always &quot;showing off.&quot;  I suppose in the end, &quot;showing off&quot; is a Potter Stewart kind of thing - you know it when you see it, but it is almost impossible to define on paper.]]></description>
