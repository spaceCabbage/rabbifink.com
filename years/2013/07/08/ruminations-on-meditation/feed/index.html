		<description><![CDATA[The Buddhist foundations for most of what passes for mindfulness meditation 
in the US is a serious problem for Jews. Their teachings are purposely intended 
to spread Buddhist concepts. They are based on the acceptance of impermanence as 
a fact.  And they teach acting out of compassion for all beings. Both of are 
wrong for Jews.

Jews know that God is permanent, and so is Torah, and so 
is Israel. We know that Shmuel the prophet didn&#039;t act out of compassion when he 
beheaded Agag, and we shouldn&#039;t act out of compassion to those who seek to wipe 
us off the map like Ahmadinejad, Hamas and Hizbullah.

So please don&#039;t 
promote Buddhist meditation as a good thing - we&#039;ve already lost too many Jews 
to the zendos, ashrams and monasteries.

Lastly, it would have been nice 
if the photo accompanying this article was of a Jew doing 
hitbo&#039;d&#039;doot/hitbo&#039;n&#039;noot  rather than a person sitting in the yogic &quot;tailor&quot; 
position with hands in a religiously significant mudra. Don&#039;t we have enough 
problems with Jews leaving to the Yoga and Buddhist worlds? Do you have to 
encourage them?]]></description>
