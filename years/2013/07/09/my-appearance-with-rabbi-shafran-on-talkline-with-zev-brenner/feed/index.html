		<description><![CDATA[rabbi fink, i thought you did a nice job - a bit different than back and forth on a blog, eh?  I feel like there were many things that shafran said that were either false, or misleading, or faulty logic.  i am sure you could have upshlugged him on many points - he is very aggresive in his language
i love when he says the agudah just wants peace and harmony with all jews and does not want jews (saks) to attack others...YEAH RIGHT!
.and either he is purposefully misleading or is just dumb, when he speaks about how open to others (especially non orthodox jews) any yeshivish shul or community is....they are not AT ALL
in addition, by stating your opinion, you are being motzei shem rah?  it does not follow]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems as if the example of the siyum hashaas is being harped on and used as a strawman. He writes that it is an example of how explosive the growth of segregationist Judaism is. It was a neutral statement. I think the issue here is that he makes an incredibly cogent and well thought out statement. That is scary to those who would rather not deal with intellectual honesty.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R. Shafran said that he was objecting to the fact that RJS used too broad of a brush and less to the argument for integration. I wonder if R. Sacks essentially meant the points made by R. Belovski of England(he also happended to be  a candidate for British Chief Rabbi) in this 2007 article in the Jewish Action:

http://www.ou.org/jewish_action/09/2007/avoiding_the_slide_into_extremism/

&quot;Despite this astounding achievement (which the Slonimer Rebbe attributed to Divine intervention), it has been argued that the process now needs to change direction. Coupled with an understandable acute mistrust of the Gentile world that gave rise to Nazism, this focus on rebuilding in the aftermath of the Holocaust has fostered an insular society so exceedingly protective of its position that it sometimes exhibits symptoms of extremism. The historian Rabbi Berel Wein has suggested that some parts of the Orthodox world behave as though the destruction of European Judaism took place just a few years ago, rather than two generations ago&quot;]]></description>
