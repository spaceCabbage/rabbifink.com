		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, it&#039;ll be on a case-by-case basis. Personally, I&#039;ve never heard a joke I liked in a rabbi&#039;s speech...they&#039;re all lame puns, or old, tired jokes from the Jackie Mason era that are delivered poorly. There&#039;s a reason the term &quot;rabbi joke&quot; exists. 


But again, if you&#039;re finding ones you&#039;re enjoying, that&#039;s good to hear. It just hasn&#039;t been my experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem with your article is that you are taking something personal that was never meant to criticize anyone personally.  It&#039;s comedy.  It&#039;s designed to be humorous by pointing out generalizations of the common experience.  The fact that you didn&#039;t find it funny is irrelevant.  My best unsolicited advice is to take a deep breath and move on.  There are bigger fish to fry than getting so worked up over a silly YouTube video. #Overkill]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Uh...I think you missed the point on this. The sketch doesn&#039;t make the claim that formulaic = bad. It makes that claim that formulaic and bad = bad. 


This humor in this video stems from the fact that it&#039;s relatable. All these speeches start with a horrible attempt at a joke to engage their listeners. They&#039;re all interminable. We&#039;ve all been there. What if, hypothetically, a rabbi started a speech with a GOOD joke? That would follow the formula, but would actually be a good thing. (Never happens, though. That&#039;s what this video is pointing out.)

The fact is, this video is actually a great example of Jewish comedy (which is really, really hard to do) because it pokes light fun at an experience that we Jews all share in, but it actually manages to end with a nice message at the end. It should be lauded.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You don&#039;t know bad taste.  I know the people who made this video (one is a good friend of mine).   They aren&#039;t people who do things in bad taste when it comes to Judaism.  If anything they&#039;re they&#039;re too careful and soft because they&#039;re truly deeply religious and spiritual people.


If you want bad taste, friend ME on Facebook.  I&#039;LL show you what bad taste and Judaism is all about.  My friend chastises ME regularly for it.   ;)


I.E.  Please lighten up and smile.  It&#039;s a frickin&#039; humorous site for Jews by Jews.   We don&#039;t all have to have to appear to the world to have big sticks up our as$es and that our sh*t smells like gefilte fish.  Get up off your high horse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jokes and funny anecdotes about the rabbi&#039;s speech have been around for a long time ... probably for as long as there have been rabbis. This is nothing new, and the content of the video is nothing new. They didn&#039;t do anything groundbreaking or particularly creative with it, all they did was set some age-old rabbi/speech jokes to puppets. Every one of the jokes has appeared in the old jewish joke books out there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s one part of it. But it&#039;s also that there is nothing of value being added here. Speeches follow a formula. There is nothing inherently wrong with that. And being an entertaining speaker is a rare gift. It&#039;s almost an impossible standard for a person who is also expected to be a Torah scholar and compassionate advisor and friend. No one person can be amazing at everything. I&#039;d like to see the Shmideo guys try architecture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[it matters not how long you work on something, the final product is what matters. and the reason its funny, and why lots of ppl like the video is that - contrary to your position - many feel the final product is perfunctory.  Maybe thats what you find offensive. (i think we have reached the core of your feelings here) but thats not the video being offensive, its just recasting the feelings of many.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is not what the video is about. A speech can be excellent even if it follows the precise formula being mocked in the video.

		<description><![CDATA[its not about you (per se) im sure all your speeches are wonderfully engaging. the point of this video and the reason it is funny, is b/c the VAST majority of rabbinic sermons are not. thats all. 


ive been to plenty of shuls where the rabbi thought he had something nice to say, but in reality, he did not. 


if the speech is perfunctory it hurts the day instead of enhancing it.  thats what the video is about.

also maturity has nothing to do with anything. mature ppl can be bored too...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the criticism was that rabbis sermons on high holidays generally suck and only put people to sleep. all speeches are the same, and - sadly - it doesnt take much to put together a high holiday sermon. 


the real underlying message: &quot;Hey Rabbis, try harder&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[lol, that was a funny video. 

But not quite as funny as you being so insulted by it. And carrying on as if it undermined anything. 



Methinks you&#039;re just sensitive because you&#039;re afraid you started your speech with a stupid joke, talked about politics that you were clueless about, talked too long, and had a boring passe message. You don&#039;t need to be so worried, I&#039;m sure it was a very good speech and I&#039;m sure the joke was very funny.]]></description>
