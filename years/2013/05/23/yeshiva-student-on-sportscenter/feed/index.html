		<description><![CDATA[Through 25 games, Marlins are averaging 47.4% tickets sold. No figures are available on actual fans through the turnstile, though anecdotally I&#039;d guess they average about 20% attendance. Keep in mind as well that the Marlins stadium has a 36,742 seat capacity, which is about 15,000 less than the average ball park, so when the Marlins have a low attendance number, it REALLY looks empty!

From his (and the guy behind him) angle, it&#039;s possible that he couldn&#039;t see the ball being caught since it may have been blocked by the top edge of the wall and the fielders arm/body as it hurtled through the air.]]></description>
