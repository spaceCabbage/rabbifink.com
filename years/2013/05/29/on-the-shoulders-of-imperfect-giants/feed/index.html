		<description><![CDATA[I recently attended a talk by a woman who&#039;s learning daf yomi, she mentioned the fact that the gemara reinterprets events or people&#039;s motives and she made the observation that &quot;We can either have a perfect text with imperfect characters, or we can have perfect characters with imperfect text&quot;.
After the presentation I overheard a fundie saying that she doesn&#039;t know &quot;how&quot; to learn, she&#039;s just reading the gemara without really understanding it; because of course the texts and the Biblical characters are all perfect, there are no contradictions. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;He argues that a graduate student who refuses to sing a song written by Walt Whitman because Whitman was a racist is wrong.... Friedersdorf writes that history is full of flawed men and women who did things that we would find abhorrent today. If we disregard their accomplishments because we are looking at them through modern glasses we lose all their contributions to society. &lt;/i&gt;



How is refusing to sing a Whitman song disregarding his accomplishment? One can acknowledge Whitman&#039;s abilities and still not be willing to sing his song. I don&#039;t think there is anything wrong with that emotion.]]></description>
