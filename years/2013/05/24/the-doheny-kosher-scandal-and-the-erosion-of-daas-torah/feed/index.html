		<description><![CDATA[WRONG! - By being &quot;strict&quot; on kashrut issues, they are being lenient in other issues, negative effecting other peoples livelihoods - if by being strict in kashrut they force a business run by G-d fearing Jews out of business, they may be taking kashrut very seriously, but they are not taking &quot;Vehavata Lorecha Kimocha&quot; very seriously, and there are opinions (Like Rabbi Akiva), that loving each other is also a part of the Torah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are STILL kosher restaurants who proudly advertise that the only use Star-K (read: not OU) certified tuna fish.

This is an ongoing &quot;chumra&quot; in some circles, despite the fact that there hasn&#039;t even been a question of dolphin meat in OU tuna in a few decades.

I&#039;m glad that Kehilla isn&#039;t trying to gain business by &quot;assuring&quot; RCC.  However, for many L.A. kosher restaurants, the hechsher they pick is a matter of marketing, not halacha.  

If they think that they will get more business from switching stickers in the front window,  I don&#039;t fault them for it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But to be fair, I noticed something weird in the introductions to the annual OU pre-pesach webcast. Belsky is introduced as Rav Hagaon, while Schachter is introduced merely as Rav. Frankly, I definitely think RHS is as much of a talmid chacham as RYB. But as the OU goes black hat, a university degree or saying hallel on yom haatzmut seems to reduce ones status. Hai and Sherira will probably be stripped of their gaon prefixes if black hatters discover they studied astronomy with secular scientists&#062;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So-called daas torah is responsible for this problem. For over a half a century they have eroded what used to be a categorical distinction of kosher and not-kosher. They have turned it into a continuum of more or less kosher, continually ratcheting up one&#039;s preferred level of observance. The OU has colluded by adoption of Glatt (which still isn&#039;t Bais Yosef) and by cooperating with others who added on their labels and supposedly higher standards.

At this point, why be surprised that an establishment approved by normative halachah of &quot;rov&quot; is not accepted by the new higher standard of being &quot;more kosher.&quot; Daas torah and a Yeshivish and chasidish culture of mehadrin lichol hadeios itself destroyed the old shulchan aruch definition of kosher.]]></description>

They have turned it into a continuum of more or less kosher, continually ratcheting up one&#8217;s preferred level of observance. The OU has colluded by adoption of Glatt (which still isn&#8217;t Bais Yosef) and by cooperating with others who added on their labels and supposedly higher standards.</p>
<p>At this point, why be surprised that an establishment approved by normative halachah of &#8220;rov&#8221; is not accepted by the new higher standard of being &#8220;more kosher.&#8221; Daas torah and a Yeshivish and chasidish culture of mehadrin lichol hadeios itself destroyed the old shulchan aruch definition of kosher.</p>
