		<description><![CDATA[You can&#039;t stifle conversation because one person said something. Someone always said something pro or against. For every good - or bad - idea, someone always said something that would stop the conversation if we simply let them have the last word.

Since are talking about NIRC, I&#039;m reminded of a 45 year old Association of Orthodox Jewish Scientists journal. Cyril Domb has an article where he talks about various ways in which they, Orthodox scientists, who are scientific in their professional lives, can upgrade their own Torah learning, by taking it more seriously and acquiring various skills, such as learning Aramaic. Included at the end are hasagos by none other than Rabbi Moshe Eisemann; I don&#039;t remember exactly what the context was; I guess Domb asked him. And for each idea that Domb had, Eisemann&#039;s response was basically &quot;who says?&quot; and &quot;this is not the way the gedolim promote chinuch, so who is he to suggest something else?&quot;

This may be your way, but it ain&#039;t my way, and I don&#039;t think it&#039;s Rabbi Fink&#039;s way. Suggestions for chinuch and innovative approaches have to be taken directly to parents, since the &quot;Who says?&quot; and &quot;Your rebbe said no changes allowed!&quot; crowd isn&#039;t going to deal with ideas at all. If you have some kind of criticism besides conflating what happens to kids in Frisch with educational ideas, why not say what they are? Just saying that R. Weinberg was against it as a conversation killer is not going to cut it here, I&#039;m sure you realize that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) everyone says everything put out in the name of RYW isn&#039;t really accurate. but from what I understand the book is based a transcript. 


2) I know he is, he&#039;s a great mechanech. But you&#039;re trying to extrapolate from that model to apply it elsewhere. You are asking why girls are instructed differently then boys, I&#039;m supplying a reason.


3 &amp; 4) I&#039;m not sure I understand your point, but Rabbi Weinberg&#039;s point was that torah learning cannot be compared to acquiring other forms of knowledge. Therefore when you apply methods that would work for teaching social sciences for example to learning torah you are undermining the nature of how torah is meant to be acquired. 


Do you agree or disagree with that principle?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pretty sure that a lot of this has to do with the emphasis on Gemara. To teach Chumash this way requires developing a much more nuanced and robust curriculum. It would take away teacher investment in Gemara.


Also, I wonder if many teachers in the schools you are referring to have to capacity to teach Chumash this way. Gemara is (unfortunately) often about presenting content and hoping that the students get the requisite skills along the way. To teach critical Chumash skills requires different pedagogical methods.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your article was forwarded to me by someone who has heard me sing this song for years, especially as I have the education of both sons and daughters to compare .  THANK YOU for sharing your thoughts publicly!  The plainest symptom of this neglect is the lack of expectation at the shabbos table that a HS bochur has anything to share about the parsha.  &quot;That&#039;s not what they do in yeshiva&quot;. Did parsha stop being important after middle school? 


The deeper symptom I have seen is a lack of resources for making connections to many topics in the gemorrah.  Boys don&#039;t have a strong foundation on which to base deeper learning, which creates lack of connection to the topic.  Is it any wonder so many show little enthusiasm for learning?  Four+ years of hours a day doing something they don&#039;t care about doing.  How can we be surprised that the final products of the &#039;system&#039; know how to &#039;talk the talk&#039; but in reality have no passion for living beyond the superficial? 

Bringing Tanach into yeshiva learning doesn&#039;t have to be earth-shattering or in place of regular learning.  BH our nation is filled with clever mechanchim who could surely devise an appropriate curriculum that is a happy medium.

Who will be the leader?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t imagine that the fact that they aren&#039;t Orthodox has anything to do with how they did or did not learn Chumash. It probably had to do more with their general Jewish identity. Although openness to new chinuch methods probably goes hand in hand with a more modern hashkafa, it is the effect, not the cause. 

I am also curious, was there any nuance to RYW&#039;s answer?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) Many talmidim of RYW say that book is not accurate. It was written by a talmid.


2) The Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov is talmid muvhak of RYW.


3) Seriously? Gil went to Frisch, he himself not a graduate of an orthodox elementary school and you are trying to compare that to NIRC high school?!


4) And do you really think that even if there was an accurate correlation that THIS would be the causation?!


Come on...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I want to give a prop out to Rabbi Schwarts of Shaarai Torah in Suffern.  This was when it was Rabbi Weins yeshiva.

In 9th grade we spent a whole year learning Vayeshev for an hour a day.  When we finished the year, we knew there was so much we did not yet cover in that one Parsha.  Recently I saw Rabbi Schwartz and thanked him specifically for that one Shiur he gave.  He informed me that he has had other people come back and thank him for the same reason.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a book called Rav Yaakov weinberg talks about chinuch he discusses if we should employ new methods to how we teach children torah. His answer was a resounding and adamant no. I will reserve my own opinion but isn&#039;t it telling that half of Rav Gil&#039;s classmates are no longer orthodox? Out of curiosity, what percentage of your fellow students from NIRC who learned chumash rashi are still orthodox?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I taught in a boy&#039;s high school I tried to teach Chumash along these lines.  I really enjoyed learning Chumash this way (in preparation for the class), but I don&#039;t think it was so successful on the student level.  Although that might just have been because I wasn&#039;t that good a teacher. 


This way of learning really brings out an appreciation for the Rishonim on Chumash.]]></description>
