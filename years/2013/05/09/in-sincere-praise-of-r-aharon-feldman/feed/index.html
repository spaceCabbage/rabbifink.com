		<description><![CDATA[Rav Feldman was the founder and initiator or Israel&#039;s English-language Yated, which, while it existed, was a despicable promulgator of cynical hatred towards anyone perceived to not toe Rav Shach&#039;s party line. The rhetoric of the American Yated, as vile as it is, is nothing, when compared to the Israel Yated.)

In the case of Lipman, he never acknowledged nor apologized for having made a statement of fact about Lipman that simply was not true: That Lipman had said that he would like to close down all the yeshiva ketanas in Yerushalayim.

Instead, Rav Feldman very cleverly said that he now sees that Lipman is a shogeig rather than a rasha.

Very cute, very cynical, but not an acknowledgement that he - Rav Feldman -- had been Motzi Shem Ra. 



What kind of a lesson does that teach out young people, when a Rosh Yeshiva does not take care to make sure he got the facts right before publicly accusing someone of something and then, when he finds out he was wrong, never acknowledges this -- yet wants it considered an apology?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;he should know better than to take a position on such serious matters&quot;

I know!  everyone should just sit and be a good boy...and not try to do anything!  follow your leaders.....

look, NIRC should be PROUD of the fact that they have an alum that is in such a high position in the Israeli government and is trying to save people and do great thinks to advance the state.  instead they denigrate him - even in their apology...its terrible

lipman is a gadol for doing what many don&#039;t do - and that is get off your butt and DO SOMETHING to change and lead.  so many just sit at their Shabbos table complaining about everything before their Shabbos afternoon nap.  Lipman doesn&#039;t nap.  He does.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eliyahu, 


What I find most disturbing about this episode is not the evaluation of Rabbi Lippman. It was the fact that a verdict was rendered without careful examination of the facts. What new facts were available to R. Feldman after Lipman&#039;s rejoinder that were not available beforehand? I am pretty sure that Rabbi Lippman would gladly have answered on the phone any questions put to him by Rabbi Feldman. I am sure he would have preferred doing that to having to defend himself in writing after the attack. 


I frankly shudder to think that anyone can pronounce so publicly and abusively without diligent inquiry beforehand. If Rabbi Feldman failed to do such inquiry beforehand his apology should have acknowledged this omission.


Can anyone be trusted as a posek who pronounces without listening to both sides. That is not d&#039;rabbonon. That is d&#039;oraisa.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;And who is qualified to disqualify their positions?&quot;

R. Aharon Lichtenstein has raised similar issues about a year ago(see quote, below **), so it&#039;s merely discussing different opinions, not disqualifying.

Also, at the 84th Aguda Convention, as mentioned in the Yated:

&quot;Rabbi [Matisyahu] Salomon took pains to declare that we have no complaint against anyone asking questions about our convictions, or even disagreeing — agreeably — with stances we have seen fit to take...&quot;

Note that:

 1) RAL is a childhood friend of RAF

2) Recognizing the problems is not the same as endorsing MK Lipman&#039;s specific solutions.

**    &quot;To illustrate, I shall mention a painful issue which characterizes one sector of the Israeli public, which has reached near-catastrophic proportions, both with regard to the ethical and human issues involved. Yesterday, two money collectors visited my home. One, who is the son of divorced parents, is supporting himself and his thirteen siblings; the other is a father of ten children who had reached a level of poverty whereby the family could no longer
subsist...

What will they eat? How will they sustain themselves? Where will the money come from?  &quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your arrogance is dispicable. That you have the right to make judgements of R&#039; Feldman&#039;s position is absurd. Who are you? You can ask questions, you can make assertions, but acting like you have the qualifications to judge him is pure arrogance. And should we be relieved that you, on your high and mighty throne, finally see it fit to sincerely praise someone? Really, who do you think you are?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Initially, I was hurt and saddened when I read R’ Feldman’s original remarks. While I can’t say I am thrilled with his position on this issue, there is something positive that I can say... It could not have been easy to apologize but it was the right thing to do and for that I admire R’ Feldman.&quot;

My feelings exactly.

I am not convinced that R. Lipman&#039;s party  is correct for trying to force the issue, and get  the Charedi world on board kicking and screaming. On the other hand, one can&#039;t deny the problem which they are trying to solve, a lack of options in education and employment.  According to Rav Dessler, &quot;Torah Only&quot; gedolim were aware of the fallout from their approach and tried at best to minimize it.

Rabbi Yaakov Horowitz has pointed out that it would have been a good strategy for the Charedi world to show that they are doing something about the isues raised(”Setting Record Straight on “Gezeros Shmad” I, II) :

“Nearly a decade ago, Rav Shteinman Shlita fully supported sending kids who weren’t learning to the army years ago as part of Nachal Charedi. It was not intended to be for a few hundred at-risk boys, but rather as a mainstreaming process for the many thousands of young men who are not cut out for a full day of learning. 

The radical kanoim (extremists) in Eretz Yisroel unleashed a vile campaign of hate and intimidation against one of our gedolei hador for having the courage to support a solution that would have been a “win-win.” It would have helped get the charedi kids at risk in israel off the streets and have them “share the burden” of military service. This would have gone a long way to sooth the simmering anger of the general population about the army matter that just exploded a few months ago…

…How different things would be in Eretz Yisroel today if the sage advice of Rav Shteinman was followed a decade ago”]]></description>
