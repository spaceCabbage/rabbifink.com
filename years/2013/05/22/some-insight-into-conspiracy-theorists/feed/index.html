		<description><![CDATA[&#062;  People who think President Obama made the tornado with a fancy weather maker to distract from current political scandals match some of these factors. They think Obama is out to get them. They think that they are doomed. They think they are powerless to stop Obama. So they turn to conspiracy theories to empower themselves as the ones who “get it”.

Or it may be that they would rather believe that the devastation was caused by the government rather than just being random bad luck. If it’s bad luck, there’s nothing you can do to stop it. If it was caused by Obama, then you can, in theory, stop him from doing it
again. Perhaps they find the idea that a natural disaster could strike anyone at any time too scary, and so come up with the theory that the government did it to give themselves a less frightening explanation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Read it again:

&quot;There are several possible reasons for this . . . Fourth, the court systems are rigged and they are bought and paid for by the ultra-orthodox community. . .
I am not saying that all these reasons are true, fair, or valid. However, they are all part of the equation. . . &quot;



The way I interpreted, you&#039;re saying that the is a contributing factor in that the courts are owned.  I was puzzled by this yesterday as well, because it really didn&#039;t seem a statement in keeping with your general character.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, look, I knew you wouldn&#039;t like this but hear me out.


There are multiple levels here. Maybe you, with all the information, facts, and insight you have can legitimately say that foul play is a possibility. But, there are many others who know nothing but the barest bones of the case and they &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; see conspiracy.


Also, my point is not that it&#039;s not possible. A conspiracy theory is not necessarily FALSE. It&#039;s just that certain people gravitate toward them. I am not saying any of the conspiracies are WRONG. Just that there is a good reason so many people are buying into them right now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Also worth pointing out, there&#039;s a contrary typology to the conspiracy theorist: it&#039;s the person overly inclined to accept the establishment narrative.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s true, you didn&#039;t. But those alleging bias here aren&#039;t saying what you&#039;re saying they&#039;re saying either. 

You&#039;ve lost me, Eliyahu. Seriously. Understanding very real political dynamics isn&#039;t the same as a conspiracy theory. It&#039;s speculative, but it&#039;s informed speculation. 

Shoddy thinking, man. I&#039;m disappointed.

P.S. Also worth pointing out, there&#039;s a contrary typology to the conspiracy theorist: it&#039;s the person overly inclined towards the establishment narrative. Don&#039;t be that person either.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Reacting to the news that a formerly chasidic woman lost custody of her children, many people see a conspiracy. They see a judge that is biased because she is bought by chasidic groups. Or they see a a judge who favors a religious home over a secular home. Or they see a judge who is afraid to stand up to a very powerful chasidic community. All of these things are possible. However, there are also legitimate reasons she lost custody.&lt;/i&gt;

I think you may have misread that discussion. They saw 100 chassidic women leave the chassidic community and they saw that 99 times the judges awarded primary custody of the children to the father. This despite the statistics usually being tilted in the completely opposite direction (or &#062;90% primary custody awarded to the woman).

I am not commenting whether or not these are the true statistics, just that this is the perception of most of the people that made the comments you are referring to.]]></description>
