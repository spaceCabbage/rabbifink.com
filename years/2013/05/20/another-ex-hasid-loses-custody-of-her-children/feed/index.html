		<description><![CDATA[No one is trying to take away the children form the father?
That&#039;s exactly what Kelly filed for. It was Kelly who first filed for sole custody.
Just to be clear, no one is taking away kids from anyone. The mother still have lots of visitations, more than any father would have had.
I&#039;m not saying this ruling is just but let&#039;s be fair about the facts of taking away kids.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s be honest - in most ultra-orthodox communities, the treatment against women when Rabbis coordinate and conspire to get the husband custody of the children has nothing to do with the mother&#039;s religious status. In most religious communities, everyone knows that any religious woman who is a victim of abuse and seeks to get out of a bad marriage will get treated horrifically, with the &quot;ganging up&quot; of Rabbis. First they try to discredit her level of observance. Then they try to portray her as psychologically unstable. It&#039;s a pattern that everyone watches as it unfolds in case after case, but no one speaks out against. The biggest problem in the ultra-orthodox communities is that there is no voice for the women who want to stay staunchly frum; there&#039;s no Rabbi that works with the women who are victims. So they are pushed off the derech because no one stands behind them. A man goes to shul a few times a day so he has a relationship with Rabbis. A woman in our community, once she is not united with her husband, is left Rabbi-less.  

So let&#039;s call a spade a spade. It&#039;s usually not that women choose to leave the fold...rather, they are pushed out. Like in my case, where Rabbis are denying my children the right to attend a local frum school so that I will be portrayed as someone not religious enough to have custody of my children. They can&#039;t break my faith in G-d, but I can fully understand how they have broken others. 

Women who are victims of their spouse&#039;s abuse get re-victimized by the Rabbis. Who will speak up for those of us who can&#039;t fight on our own?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hatzlocha.  All I can tell you is get a good lawyer and one who follows both halacha and the law!  Remember that Hashem is watching and is the real true Judge in the end.  Also remember that &quot;end&quot; is not the end of the case.  The end is when the children find out the truth for themselves and decide in their adult lives who they choose to honor and respect.


Remember to be dignified at all times and to act as a true Bas Yisroel.  Chin up and shoulders back.  Never lose sight of who you are or who you want your children to grow up to be.  You are still their role model.  You are the only one who can help your attorneys, tell them the truth and don&#039;t hide anything from them.  It is only with the truth that they can help you, surprises will only come back to bite you.  Forewarned is forearmed.  If you made mistakes, let them know, don&#039;t hold back.  


I work with an attorney to help women in your position.  I help clients through the process.  Cooperation is key to success.  It is those clients who&#039;s attorneys are hit with surprises and hidden agendas by revelations from the opposing attorneys who lose the faith, respect and enthusiasm of their own attorneys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sadly, this is not a new phenomenon.  There was the infamous, &quot;Where&#039;s Yossie&quot; case in Israel in the 60s.  The frum grandparents kidnapped a child who was being raised by a non-frum parent.  There was a manhunt for many years until the child was tracked down.  More, recently, Rabbi Shlomo Helbrans was convicted of kidnapping in Brooklyn.   He kidnapped a non-frum Israel child who had been brought to him for bar-mitzvah lessons.  In both these and other cases, much of the ultra-frum community supports Helbrans, et al.  


Shulem Deen is an intelligent, credible writer and researcher.  Yasher koach to him for exposing this case.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; But when children are used to keep people in the fold we cross the line from deplorable
to cult-like. The community does not own the children. That is what happens in
a cult. Parents are responsible to raise their children as they deem fit. 

You know better than that. The community doesn’t see it as being manipulative or taking children away from a good mother. They see it as rescuing neshamos from the depravity that their mother – who is, like anyone who would leave the community, obviously an immoral hedonist – would expose them to. If fear of losing her children brings their mother back on the derech, so much the better.

The frum world certainly doesn’t believe that “Parents are responsible to raise their children
as they deem fit.” They believe that parents have a responsibility to raise their children as the gedolim deem fit. Explicitly. Yeshivos claim the right to dictate what students may do even when not in school, and believe that parents have handed over their children to be raised
by the schools.]]></description>

If fear of losing her children brings their mother back on the derech, so much the better.</p>
<p>The frum world certainly doesn’t believe that “Parents are responsible to raise their children<br />
as they deem fit.” They believe that parents have a responsibility to raise their children as the gedolim deem fit. Explicitly. Yeshivos claim the right to dictate what students may do even when not in school, and believe that parents have handed over their children to be raised<br />
by the schools.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The cynical way the community deals with these situations highlights the contradiction inherent in their approach to living in, and being citizens of the US. 
They trash talk the goyim around them all the time, they don&#039;t want any part of them, when there&#039;s a business dispute they want the parties to go to bais din, but when it&#039;s to their advantage they suddenly run to the US court system.
