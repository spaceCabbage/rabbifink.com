A) did you put a 0 instead of O in Zionist to avoid spam?  If so, I love that.  If not, I do not intend to jst point out typographical errors

B) While I have called some of your earlier posts on Israel naive, I think you have a nicely nuanced and objective view here.

		<description><![CDATA[so you only want to change things if there is a &quot;gadol&quot; (charedi, presumably) who would &quot;side&quot; with Lipman.?!?!?!
did you know there are many &quot;gedolim&quot; that run hesder yeshivot, and other institutions that would &quot;side&quot; with Lipman?  
you are stacking the deck unfairly and only allowing charedi gedolim, who are nogeah b&#039;davar, to issue any kind of change - impossible.
That is why Lipman&#039;s compromise is so attractive....and its a shame he gets thrown under the bus...GOD FORBID someone has a different opinion or different solution....HE MUST BE A RASHA!!

		<description><![CDATA[I have never posted here, but I feel this is an important issue and feel that my thoughts have some level of validity, 

 As an American Orthodox Jew with a yeshiva education who also
understands Israeli Charedi society, I would like to throw in my 2 cents into
this issue. I relate better to the Ner Israel (and general American yeshiva..)
system. There are those who claim that post high school yeshivas and certainly
kollelim are not necessary. They point to the fact that historically there were
frum boys who left &quot;learning full time&quot; at the age of 12, 13, ect.
I,(and I assume Dov Lipman) don&#039;t side with them. I understand the necessity of
a yeshiva education for a longer period of time, if possible past ones marriage
to start out the family in a torah way even if they are not going to become
rabbanim.  

I, having gotten a yeshiva high school education, understand
that it is important in this day in age to have some type of secular education
to be able to succeed in the workplace. I don&#039;t understand how a society can be
built where everyone is cut out for full time learning for the rest of their
lives. It does not make sense that this is how things should be, and in this
regard I can understand where Dov Lipman (and for that matter Yair Lapid, I
personally don&#039;t think he is intentionally trying to destroy Torah) is coming
from.  

The Charedi yeshiva system of today was built on the draft deferment
set up by David Ben Gurion after pressure from the Chazon Ish and other
Gedoilim. They did not see the army as a proper place for a frum boy, while
they wanted to rebuild a Torah world that had been (along with the rest of the
Jewish world) severely crippled. This arraignment was the perfect solution and
indeed Torah learning (In quantity, at least) is flourishing in a way not seen
for perhaps thousands of years, if ever.  

As Charedim become a larger percentage of the Israeli
population the issue has come to the forefront.  It’s unsustainable that such a large segment
of the population should continue learning and out of the workplace, but
they won’t go to the army because of what it will do to their spirituality. We
can’t just say that if you are Charedi you don’t have to go to the army- that
is so unfair to the others that are required to go to the army regardless. It’s
wrong, on the other hand, to claim that there is no threat to religious observance
in the army because that is simply not true (there, I said it. I am sure there
are many national religious Jews who will scoff at that but the statistics back
it up).  

So what do you do?

The answer to that question is what alludes us today. There
is no one who can give an answer that really takes into account all of those
issues. You can claim that new army units that are exclusively religious will
preserve the strong level of observance in its members, but who says that it
will really work.  Additionally, who decides
who gets to stay in yeshiva? Are there tests? Are the test objective? What about
a late bloomer who may not yet be on the level of the top talmidim but will
thrive if allowed to stay in yeshiva? Who is going to tell the aspiring Talmud chochom
that he is not doing well enough to continue his Torah study and become a rav or
rebbi that he so desperately wants to be? 

The Gedolim are not clueless. They don’t call them Gedolim
for nothing, Torah teaches them how to act in situations even beyond Halacha. There
are those who like to claim that daas torah is a new concept, they clearly don’t
know history. Jews have always consulted with their leaders, and they have kept
us afloat through all of these years. We may not understand everything that the
Gedoilim do, but we must realize that they are aware of what is going on, are consistently
working to help preserve a Torah society, and are going to come up with a
solution far better than ours on our own. Not all gedoim agree on all issues, and frankly
not all gedolim agree on this issue, but they speak with one voice denouncing Lapid’s
attempts to solve this particular problems. 

If Dov Lipman had one great Torah scholar in his corner then
my argument would be weakened, but he doesn’t

So how can one oppose the great Torah leaders and think that
they are going to end up on the right side of history?  (Spoiler alert- it’s never happened) 

So what can be done? 

If I knew the answer to that question then I wouldn’t be
sitting here posting a blog comment. What I do know is that we have to trust
our Gedolim. We have to have a rebbi, a moral compass that we trust to advise
us on major issues. Someone that can insure that our decisions are nor
influenced by external, personal agendas. Someone that shares our common
values, knows Torah and will guide us accordingly. It’s sort of humbling to
know that we don’t have all the answers, but true intelligence is to know that
there are some things that we don’t.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although I didn&#039;t vote for Yesh Atid, I have been happy with the outcome of the Bayit Yehudi - Yesh Atid - Likud Beiteinu coalition.

I&#039;m also happy that Rav Lipman is serving as an MK for Yesh Atid.

He represents the majority opinion of shomrei mitzvot in Israel.

When Yair Lapid says that the Israeli government ought not pay for Charedim to not work and not serve in the army, the Charedi world can easily dismiss it.

When Naftali Bennett, with his &quot;little kipah&quot;, says the same thing, and throws in that army service and working for a living are both mitzvot, it&#039;s a little harder to dismiss him  - but he&#039;s one of those &quot;Tzioyinishe&quot; looking shomrei mitzvot.

When a man in a black hat and jacket says the same thing, the Israeli Charedi leaders really start to get nervous.

Israeli Charedi leaders lash out the hardest at Rav Lipman, lest their adherents see someone who looks like them saying such &quot;kefira&quot;, and think it&#039;s okay to listen.

American Charedi leaders simply parrot what they hear from the &quot;Gedolei Eretz Yisroel&quot;, because they feel that this is their job.

Eli - EVEN IF Rav Lipman would get up and say the exact words, &quot;Israeli Charedim should be more like American Charedim&quot; - the &quot;Gedolim&quot; would denounce it, and by definition, the American Charedi leaders would also have to denounce it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mainstream American Gedolim&#039;s opinion is that it is bedievid, as  outlined in MOAG p. 310-311:

   After a visit with our protagonist in 5732 (1972), R&#039; Mikhel
Zilber reported that my father considered a high school education
an imperative for Jews residing in America in his day. My father
told him that when a well-known mashgiah had asked him whether to send his son to school, he replied affirmatively, citing an evaluation that &quot;all those who did not attend school were not successful in learning (Torah) either&quot;. For Jews residing in Eretz Yisrael, however, he considered secular education anathema. and summed up for R&#039; Zilber, &quot;In America you must, and in Eretz Yisrael you must not.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a supporter of Dov Lippman and wish him well in his quest to find a&quot; tzvil  hazahav.&quot; He applauded a daunting task especially since he is for better or worse aligned with Lapid&#039;s party.He needs to walk softly and carry a big stick. Perhaps, what would help him is a informational tour to various roshei yeshiva&#039;s in the US until he finds one that will openly support his platform. Dov may be naive ( and I may be too) but his hishtadlus should applauded and supported.

As to R Fink&#039;s description, it also has great  merit although I agree with many of those who have posted comments that  many of us in the US do not identify ourselves as charedim, even if we meet R finks criteria. We are just observant Jews without  a tag line..

While that is hard in Eretz Yisroel as religion and politics meet at the corner of uncomfortable and insincerity ( to borrow from a radio commercial) , we in US have the ability to pick and choose and may of us do just that.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; I think that American charedim subscribe to 1-3, but not necessarily 4-6. 

American Chareidim subscribe to 1-4, agree to varying degrees with 5 (from those who have no secular education, to those who see it as a waste of time imposed by the government, to those who would rather not, but if you’re going to have it, figure you might as well do it right), and are ambivalent about 6.

&#062; I think MK Lipman would be thrilled if Israeli charedim were like Lakewood charedim.
They get a secular education, they work (eventually), they even support the State of Israel to a certain degree.

They do? Some may work eventually, but that’s regarded as a b’dieved, an unfortunate necessity for those that nebach can’t learn full time. And the yeshivish world supports Israeli tzedakos, but the State? At best they’re indifferent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, &quot;Chareidi&quot; is an Israeli term which describes something cultural that is not native to American Orthodoxy and doesn&#039;t really exist here. There is no such thing as &quot;American Chareidim&quot;. People in the US that you are describing as Chareidi, probably wouldn&#039;t use that term to describe themselves.
I think that the class of American Orthodoxy which you are describing as Chareidi is supporting the Israeli Chareidim not because of the particular quality of the Israeli Chareidi aggregation, but rather because of who the opposition is.
It&#039;s sort of like Americans admiring Margaret Thatcher not so much because we knew anything about her, but because of who she opposed politically.]]></description>
