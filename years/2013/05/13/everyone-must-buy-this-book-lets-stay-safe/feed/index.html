		<description><![CDATA[Where have you seen a copy of the police report?  I can&#039;t find it anywhere on the internet.

Anyway you can&#039;t predict the outcome of a court trial by a police report.  Do you know how many people swore Weberman would walk for lack of evidence?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually the book ruined the case against the teacher. The only two accusers(a six and seven year old) were read the book by a 12 year old who explained to them her worldly knowledge about abuse. Only afterwards did they say anything to any adults. There is basically no chance of any convictions in this case, since no other children(the girls are not sisters-there is no reason only they should have been abused) have come forward. The reading of the book, found in the the police report which can be easily found on the internet, will mean the evidence was coerced by the older child. Btw, as a lawyer, you should really look into the case and see what you think of it.]]></description>
