		<description><![CDATA[Not quite.  As one of the co founders of Women FOR The Wall, I can tell you that it is not at all about the Ultra Orthodox being scared that their way of life is being challenged.  First off I&#039;m not Ultra Orthodox and I&#039;m very open minded.  I came to Israel with NATIV the USY Leadership Training Program and I consider myself a Committed Jew (I don&#039;t like all the other labels).  In fact two of the three founders are not Ultra Orthodox and the one who is, considers herself Quasi Haredi.  We are modern, educated women who were disgusted at WoW&#039;s use of a holy site for their political gain and the damage they have caused in Israel Diaspora relations and to Israel&#039;s PR in general.  By all means protest all you like at the Knesset, leave The Kotel for those who hold it dear, seek unity and not those who wish to make a &#039;national monument&#039; out of it.  As for leaving them alone to do their thing.  Here is the problem, well meaning people like you who don&#039;t &#039;get it&#039;. Strangely the Ultra Orthodox &#039;get it&#039; and so too the secular / traditional Israelis &#039;get it&#039; but somehow the modern Orthodox community doesn&#039;t. So here it is, this isn&#039;t about women&#039;s rights or women&#039;s prayers at all.  This is about control and money.  As you see the latest spin, which is that WoW will accept the &#039;compromise&#039; and go to the Ezrat Israel but only if Anat calls the shots and has her hand on the funds.  If it was about peaceful sincere prayer at all, they would have gone to Robinson&#039;s Arch in 2003 and been left alone and none of us would be wasting time discussing this.  But there was too much to be gained, they are greedy and they want it all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with the self-declared Epicurean.

If this were about prayer, they would have taken the far holier spot at the south corner, where they can stand on the very street where olei laregel stood, next to stones from the azarah, and away from the gawking and picture-taking of tourists. But that offer was turned down. Because they&#039;re interested in changing status quo at the plaza, not prayer itself.

This is about busting the Orthodox identity of Jewishness in Israel, despite Conservative and today&#039;s Reform being American inventions that are still being imported there. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iViCahvAEww&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Anat Hoffman said to the BBC&lt;/a&gt;,  &quot;I think when you change the holiest site of the Jewish people you are actually asking why not about a variety of other life choices dictated to Israelis by the Orthodox monopoly. I am also questioning why are the Orthodox the only ones in charge of  marriage and divorce in Israel?  Many Israelis want to get married in other ways and we do not have civil marriage or Reform and Conservative marriage and more importantly Reform or Conservative divorce. Some of us wish to get buried not by Orthodox custom but by Reform, Conservative or secular custom.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;Then they started getting arrested&#039;.  There is a reason for that.  They weren&#039;t getting enough coverage doing it quietly, so they changed tactic.  For many years they came and davened without talit and tefilin but as a group.  It bothered some but they were left alone.  After the Supreme Court ruling in which the section of The Kotel under Robinson&#039;s Arch was offered as an alternative; not just to WoW but to the Reform and Conservative movements as well, as a place for any non status quo prayer service,  They slowly began to come back to the plaza.  Over the last number of years, depending on the Israeli political landscape they began to pray with taliot and tefilin which drew attention.  A bit of heckling from mostly misbehaving boys who obviously find it strange and offensive.  Every once and a while this ended up in the papers but not enough.  In the last two years Anat Hoffman has taken the group to new heights, ensuring arrests almost every month to put them in the press.  They come with their lawyer and their media team.  They tell people that they are arrested for &#039;wearing a talit, a kippa, or tefilin&#039; or for &#039;carrying a Sefer Torah&#039;.  None of which is true.  They have been arrested for disobeying court orders, disturbing the peace, not listening to police officers etc...  They are using it as an opportunity to get to their real goal which isn&#039;t prayer but rather to tear down the existing Israeli infrastructure.  Because if their kavana was true prayer and connecting to HaShem they&#039;d go to Robinson&#039;s Arch pray quietly where no one would bother them (no one bothers the Reform or Conservative groups that go there for real prayer) and where they would bother no one,]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off, they do not &#039;just&#039; learn, read their articles, listen to their leaders, and you&#039;ll see they have a larger agenda aside from learning. To the Charedim it&#039;s about keeping their children safe (while others sacrifice all), about securing other special rights, and running a political platform for the acceptance of the Charedi control over Israeli society. (mind you, these are the Charedim who forever have been the most anti-Zionist of all the sects of Judaism, they never supported the State.) Secondly, we all agree that ignoring them would have been the best option, however the reality being that there will always be many of them, with substantial electoral power, and the few who protest violently regardless, in their extreme ways, therefore the current government felt it extremely important not to ignore it, but rather protest it, albeit peacefully in order to outnumber those who were bound to make a theocratic state.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off, they do not &#039;just&#039; come to pray, read their articles, and you&#039;ll see they have a larger agenda aside from praying. To the WOW it&#039;s about woman&#039;s lib, about securing rights, and running a political platform for the acceptance of the Reform movement in Israeli society. (mind you, these are the Reform who forever have been the most anti-Zionist of all the sects of Judaism, they never supported the State.) Secondly, we all agree that ignoring them would have been the best option, however the reality being that there will always be the few who protest regardless, in their extreme ways, therefore the Rabbanim felt it extremely important not to ignore it, but rather protest it, albeit peacefully in order to outnumber those who were bound to make a Chilul Hashem. This was not intended as a political protest, rather it was supposed to be a Kiddush Hashem, and religious jewry taking a stand for the kedusha of the Kotel, by coming to pray. Lastly, the idea of bringing thousands of girls there was to bring awareness to Jews across the world. In all previous WOW events, there were a handful of WOW woman and a handful of other woman each doing their thing by the Kotel. When this is portrayed in the media the world saw this as an equal amount of woman of each side praying by the Kotel, and than sympathizing with WOW, b/c hey, there&#039;s an equal number of you, so why discriminate against WOW. By this mass gathering of religious woman the intent was to show the world that NO, they are in fact a true minority, and the majority of Kotel goers&#039; Jewish values run a lot deeper than these woman of WOW.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right, I skipped right over point 2 because I&#039;m working FT, shopping and getting ready for Shavuot ...and you gave me something to think about....so I didn&#039;t dismiss what you said out of hand. It raises an interesting question--at what point does the freedom to swing your minhag end at my kavanah, so to speak? I&#039;m not on the men&#039;s side, but my understanding from my husband is that it is big enough (twice the size of the women&#039;s section, another sore point with all women) that if you find someone&#039;s style distracting, you and/or your minyan have ample room to move....we don&#039;t have that on the women&#039;s side, and our tradition since 1967 has been to daven quietly without singing and dancing and chanting. WoW has been sufficiently loud that I&#039;ve skipped Rosh Chodesh for several years now---don&#039;t like the circus, the noise, but ignoring them hasn&#039;t improved things--it&#039;s only encouraged them to demand more. As you can see from their most recent comments, their position is that if their practices make the majority of women uncomfortable, well, then the majority should just vacate and let them have the Kotel...listen, I hold no brief for the chareidi; I&#039;m one of the majority of Israelis who think they need to teach secular subjects, serve in the military or national service, work for a living, support their own children, and end yeshiva allowances.....nor do I hold with their stringencies in prayer and practice. OTOH, I don&#039;t go looking to offend people. And if someone tells me my behavior is distracting or offensive, then I will attempt to conciliate by compromising in a way that doesn&#039;t offend...I was originally cool with WoW, but as they got louder and more obnoxious, I and many MO friends sort of backed away from them--like others have commented, it became less and less about the right to pray as they wished and more about an anti-chareidi/anti-orthodox agenda.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is quite the straw-man argument, and maybe it helps me understand where you&#039;re coming from. If I really believe that WOW would (or could!) end mechitzah davvening at the kotel and force the orthodox away, I&#039;d be opposed to them too. The problem I have with that argument is that it assumes that Orthodoxy can&#039;t survive without a coercive state to prop it up. If the state continues to not arrest women for praying as they want to in the women&#039;s section, and men in the men, the Orthodox will continue to pray as they want to in both sections and in the rest of the country—their way of life is not at risk (just as it isn&#039;t at risk here in America, where we have separation of church and state and Orthodoxy writ large is thriving). Respecting democracy doesn&#039;t mean arresting those in the minority or evicting them from public, shared spaces.


I&#039;m also very curious as to your response to my second point, which you skipped right over. There&#039;s probably democratic consensus that schnorrers at the wall hurt everyone&#039;s davvening experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Your semantic distinction is unimportant.&quot; Reaaaallly? Good--let&#039;s see you try to daven on the Temple Mount and we&#039;ll see how &quot;semantics&quot; prevails against disturbing the peace laws. Law is based on the semantics of words--that&#039;s the essence of it.

You&#039;re clearly unfamiliar with the &quot;goals&quot; of the group, which different members have stated in different ways many times on their own FB page and in responses to OpEds and new stories, and in their own OpEds. WoW spokesman yesterday advised members of Women for the Wall (orthodox) to pray at private synagogues if they view their (WoW&#039;s) freedom of religion as offensive.“I only wish them to embrace the democracy in Israel which allows all of us to pray freely at a holy site with- in the public domain,” Pruce said. “If it upsets them, they have a variety of private synagogues to choose from.” [http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Nascent-coalition-challenges-Women-of-the-Wall-312977] In other words, the orthodox majority should go away. 



In sum, WoW intends to chase out the orthodox and convert the Plaza into a Reform/Conservative space. Nevermind that the people who daven there daily are orthodox, or that mainstream Judaism is normative, traditional Judaism (what you in the States call &quot;orthodox&quot;), and that the Reform and Conservative are a very small minority which hold no appeal to Jews here. Their stated goal, stated here and in other places, is to abolish orthodox prayer practices and chase out orthodox Jews who want to pray here. If Pruce wishes to invoke democracy, I&#039;m all for that--majority rules, and the majority of people praying at the Kotel are orthodox, so orthodox minhagim should prevail over minority Reform practices.

Don&#039;t misquote me, ok? I never said they should pay--if you bothered with the rest of this thread you would see that I pointed out that Robinson&#039;s Arch can be &quot;fixed&quot; so it is free to prayer groups, and open 24/7 and certainly can be opened for Rosh Chodesh.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That sounds very nice, but I think a bit naive.  The agenda of the Women at the Wall used to be to pray, but that core of sincere women were so turned off by the political posturing that was taking place within WOW that they left. Their is an agenda of WOW to override the power of male orthodox authority.  They could easily pray their hearts out at Robinson&#039;s Arch in total peace and also not offend the tradition of the Kotel.  I am not against change, but I also have a healthy respect for the sacred tradition of the Kotel.  I am glad so many woman came out Friday morning to let the authorities know, not that they are against WOW, but that they respect the traditions of the Kotel and would like to keep them that way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Seminary girls were not &quot;sent&quot; by their schools&lt;/i&gt;

Here is an article by the organizer of W4tW, and some quotes -

&lt;i&gt;&quot;We bused in people from dati leumi communities, dati leumi schools sent girls.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;And this was despite Women For the Wall only existing for less than three/ weeks, working with askonim to try to make this happen.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;When we approached the Chareidi gedolim and told them what we want to do on Rosh Chodesh&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;We’re therefore interested in going to the gedolim, asking them to come out with a psak that women should come, but guys absolutely have to stay home&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[(1) Your semantic distinction is unimportant. For 10 years the police and courts arrested women for wearing tallit and davenning aloud at the kotel; the fact that the statute under which they were arrested was more general doesn&#039;t change the fact that functionally, a law prevented them from wearing tallit or davvening aloud at the kotel. This point is underscored by the fact that the district judge&#039;s decision construing the underlying statute didn&#039;t actually change anything in the law—just the application of the &#039;03 supreme court decision; nevertheless, functionally, women were permitted to perform actions that, performed a month earlier, would have been against Israeli law. Call it what you will.


(2) Let&#039;s say I don&#039;t care for carlebachi davvening. When I go to the kotel, do I have a right to kick out all the men who interrupt my kavannah w/ their carlebach nonsense? What about mizrachim who use tunes I&#039;m unfamiliar with and change the nusach of the amidah, which no one should touch? What about Chassidim who flagrantly flaunt halachic zmanim? Surely their aveiros are so severe as to prevent me from having the kavannah necessary at the holy kotel. And let&#039;s not even talk about the schnorrers. But that&#039;s just it—the kotel is not my private shul at home—it&#039;s a public place where all kinds of Jews are forced, if they want to share it, to accept each other&#039;s differing practices and customs, even when they are disruptive. So no, you don&#039;t have a right not to be subjected to WoW singing of hallel any more than I have a right to daven without someone asking me for tzedaka or singing hallel loudly to a tune I find grating. That&#039;s just the way of public shared space.


(3) You&#039;re conflating the group  w/ its goals. The goal of WOW is for any woman whenever she wants to to be able to daven at the kotel unmolested. That means wearing tefillin every morning. And to say that those women who want to daven at the kotel have to go pay money and wait for Robinson&#039;s arch to be open is unfair and unequal, especially if they don&#039;t want to daven with men.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I find bothering is that the most of the women wearing tefillin don&#039;t seem to know what they are doing.   If they truly want to perform the mitzvah - isn&#039;t there anyone there to show them the right way.  



You see tefillin being put on on top of hats.  Worn on the forehead.  Completely lopsided, etc.  I think I only saw one woman wearing ithem correctly.


What&#039;s up with that?   Wearing them incorrectly does suggest that they&#039;re not doing it out of sincere devotion but to stir the pot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(1) No, it&#039;s not a law against wearing tallit and davening. There is no such law. The law is against disturbing the peace by violating the customs of the site--which are orthodox. 


(2) And I have an equal right to not be subjected to their customs. What makes their &quot;right&quot; to sing and dance and chant in a group override my right to quiet kavanah to pray? If in a democracy the majority controls, then the majority at the Kotel and the majority in Israel are orthodox of various stripes.


(3) Robinson&#039;s Arch is not open 24/7 -- but then WoW aren&#039;t there 24/7, so why raise this red herring? They only come on Rosh Chodesh, and free admittance could certainly be arranged---but they don&#039;t want it. They want to disrupt my prayers and show us their version of &quot;empowerment&quot; which many find intrusive. If orthodox women want to come and pray quietly in tallit, I could care less. OTOH, maybe out of respect for local customs, they could daven with tallit in their own synagogue instead of violating somebody&#039;s (not mine) concept of kli gever? Is that kind of respect and consideration beyond them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, let&#039;s put it in perspective---Women4theWall spread via twitter and FB, and pulled in non-chareidi women and planned this prayer gathering for the next Rosh Chodesh before any rabbi was consulted. Some chareidi women were uncomfortable without having a blessing from their rabbis, and sought them; others did not, and certainly those of us in the MO/masorti group didn&#039;t ask for that. Seminary girls were not &quot;sent&quot; by their schools--that misstates what happened.  If you know anything about ulpanot and yeshivot in Jerusalem, then you know the better ones require the students to stay on campus or in the neighborhood--to the extent that they had to travel to get to the Kotel, some girls needed permission to leave campus, sought it, and were granted it (daughter of a friend of mine did this) -- mischaracterizing this as &quot;seminary girls were sent by their schools&quot; is not called for. My friend&#039;s daughter&#039;s classmate chose NOT to come because she had something else to do,and no school or rabbi &quot;sent&quot; her. It&#039;s not exactly as you&#039;re trying to mischaracterize it, either--some chareidi rabbinical plot to force poor compliant females into a confrontation.

		<description><![CDATA[In a self-fulfilling prophesy - it may now have gone from being a bunch of women who want to pray their way, to something greater.  It seems that the Conservative and Reform movements have realized that this issue has become a chink in the armor the chareidim have built to maintain control of ritual issues in Israel and would like to find a way to use it as the cornerstone to wrestle their way into areas that have been dominated by the chareidim.   (e.g. marriage, divorce, conversion, overall management of Jewish holy sites, etc.)  

For more than 20 years nobody paid attention to WoW outside of the Kotel admin.  I think tangentially related events of the last couple of years that have made their way into the mainstream media (e.g. Chareim harassing young girls on the way to school in Beit Shemesh) created a media  interest in the story Israel&#039;s mistreatment of women at the hands of chareidim.  WoW capitalized on that media interest to get their story heard and picked up a broad base of support both in Israel and the Diaspora.

AFAIK, WoW has not cared about egalitarian prayer.  They&#039;ve attracted dati women who would never participate in egalitarian minyanim.    WoW has managed to gain a foothold among the Israeli populous that the Conservative/Reform covet, and have not been able to achieve on their own.   I think that&#039;s why we now see Conservative Rabbis making appearances with WoW and they are the ones trying to change the message by inserting themselves into the debate.   



If they had left WoW alone a long time ago, we would be far better off.  I still think it&#039;s the right thing to do, and you do the right thing even if you now have a more concerning element trying to ride their coattails to the limelight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) &quot;After losing their court case, they then chose to violate the law every month, which is why they were arrested. &quot;—yes, the law against wearing tallit and davening, which existed until last month&#039;s court decision. 

2) The WOW don&#039;t want / aren&#039;t interested in egalitarian davvening. They want to daven as a women&#039;s tefillah group, as should be their right in the women&#039;s section of the kotel plaza.

3) Robinson&#039;s Arch, while lovely, isn&#039;t comparable to the kotel plaza for two important reasons—it&#039;s not open 24/7, and you have to pay to use it. If/when the Sharansky plan comes to fruition I would love to use the new free/open egalitarian section of the kotel, but it doesn&#039;t exist yet. More importantly, non-egalitarian women who want to both wear tallitot and daven shouldn&#039;t be forced to join me there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hahahahaha!  Very funny! Most of my friends and family think I&#039;m strong, and I wouldn&#039;t have survived years of litigation practice by being a wall-flower, so so much for long-distance bad guesswork/vest-pocket psychoanalysis. Yeah, I like equal pay for equal work and voting also, so quit falling into the trap that anyone orthodox must be antedeluvian--your stereotyping is showing. It&#039;s not pretty. No, I dislike WoW&#039;s rudeness and their insistence on disrupting everyone else&#039;s prayers because they feel they have a &quot;right&quot; to do so. You&#039;re correct, there are religious intricacies involved in a large group of people praying, which can probably be worked out. But everything said by WoW members is that they&#039;re not interested in compromise (Anat Hoffman was, but then withdrew that when they won the last court case saying she didn&#039;t need to compromise any more). If a woman wants to come to the plaza and wear tallit and pray next to me, hey, fine--ok by me and chareidi guys shouldn&#039;t be watching anyway. But a group singing and chanting loudly is disruptive--there are a number of shuls near by where women&#039;s minyanim happen routinely, and the &quot;egalitarian section&quot; is also available--as a compromise if you could ever convince the self-righteous of WoW to compromise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Imagine someone wanting to play rock n&#039; roll at a classical music concert.  No judgement on the value of rock n&#039; roll, but it certainly would disturb the patrons of the classical music concert.


Imagine if a group of Christians wanted to hold their service at the Wall?  What about a group of Jews up on the Temple Mount, alongside the Muslims?


Clearly, freedom of religious expression must be tempered with existing situations and norms that are accepted.  The WoW want to challenge the existing situation.  So who is the provocateur?]]></description>
