		<description><![CDATA[It also wouldn&#039;t be marit ayin if you made a heker.

&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, before we begin, I have an announcement to make.  David and Trisha will be legally married according to the state of California, at the conclusion of this ceremony.  However, because Trisha is a Gentile, this wedding is not a kiddushin, and cannot be considered a legitimate marriage according to halacha, our traditional Jewish Law&quot;



If you want to make that public declaration before you perform an intermarriage, I suppose technically you wouldn&#039;t be doing anything wrong.


P.S. , I&#039;d love to see a video of you doing that  :o)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For an Orthodox rabbi to preside over a wedding that is ineligible for kiddushin, would present a major issue of marit ayin.

It&#039;s bad enough that Reform converts think that they had an Orthodox conversion, because they went to the Orthodox mikvah in town.

A Jewish man and a Gentile woman will have a child, and he will grow up, and point to the fact that  his parents had an Orthodox wedding, and other frum people will rely on that fact.

Would you really put yourself in that situation, allowing all of the falsehoods that would follow, on your account?  I sincerely hope that you would not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Rabbi Fink,

Thank you for taking the time to review &quot;Doublelife.&quot; I would like to clarify a few points. 

First - the letter format. Perhaps we should have written some kind of a disclaimer at the beginning. Most people seem to understand and appreciate the letter format and why we chose it. For example, blogger Judy Gruen wrote &quot;The Bermans tell their story in a series of letters to one another, a diary format that allows them each to give full expression to their insights, questions and emotions. It makes for a very compelling read.&quot; Chaviva Galatz wrote, &quot;the clever way the book is presented as letters was appealing to me, as it didn&#039;t feel like you were reading a book so much as a correspondence.&quot; No, of course we did not actually communicate solely by writing letters to each other over the course of our marriage. However, everything that is in the letters is a memorialization of actual conversations that took place (example: of course we discussed whether to have a Christmas tree as virtually any intermarried couple does - that we put what was a very real conversation in letter form doesn&#039;t make it any less real). Most readers have told us that the letter format made them feel like they were right there as the conversation was taking place. The letters were our way of making the story a conversation between us, which is what any marriage is about. If we had written this in more standard format directed outwardly to the reader, it wouldn&#039;t have captured our journey nearly as well. We have found that a minority of readers, as you did, took the letters extremely literally. For them, we should have added an explanatory note so they could &quot;suspend their imagination.&quot;

I was surprised to see your characterization that &quot;the more liberal branches of Judaism were so antagonistic toward&quot; us. I don&#039;t believe we ever said or implied that. The issue was never that we weren&#039;t welcomed because we were intermarried. As we make clear, the liberal synagogue where we belonged welcomed interfaith families with open arms and was very welcoming to my wife. The larger issue which we portray is that 1) many liberal Jewish settings (in our experience, and we&#039;ve experienced a lot of them) are not so warm in general because they lack the sense of community and commitment that many more traditional settings have (for example, the communal sense of Shabbat is very different in the Orthodox world); and 2) as I&#039;ve written about elsewhere (see http://www.jta.org/2013/04/25/life-religion/from-church-choir-to-jerusalem-a-couples-interfaith-journey) the acceptance of intermarriage in liberal Jewish circles simply isn&#039;t enough - what we found in Orthodoxy was a challenge to grow, to dig deeper - what we found in more liberal Jewish circles was an emphasis simply on making us feel comfortable.

We did not &quot;portray the positions of other denominations to puff up Orthodox Judaism.&quot; We actually never portrayed the positions of Reform or Conservative Judaism at all, and that was deliberate. Our goal was not to portray positions, but to describe what actually happens on the ground, which is much more important to the end user. It is true that we were only describing our own experience, which is all we have. However, we have spent a lot of time in many different settings across the Jewish spectrum and have seen a lot more of it than most. And in my work as a Federation Director and Jewish communal professional, I had the opportunity to observe an even wider spectrum. I think it&#039;s fair to say that our descriptions of what happens in non-Orthodox settings are not unique to us. I understand the temptation to want to gloss over the differences and the shortcomings so that we can all get along. And although we need to all get along, those differences and shortcomings really exist. And for that matter, we did not hesitate to point out problematic experiences we had in the Orthodox world (as well as positive experiences in the non-Orthodox world, such as the Reform rabbi who first introduced me to Shabbat).

As to the unasked question - what should be our approach to intermarriage - from where I sit, the Reform approach has not worked (and I&#039;m not the only one to say this - there are many voices in the Reform movement also saying this). It has resulted in a number of interfaith families joining a Reform temple (which is not a small thing), but has not resulted in significant engagement with Judaism for most of them (and that&#039;s before even getting into the very real halachic issues). I say that from direct observation and from reading the several studies that have been done.

I therefore believe that the Orthodox have a unique role to play, one that does not accept intermarriage as perfectly ok, but at the same time welcomes families to explore the depth and richness that an observant life has to offer. An Orthodox-style Shabbat, as just one example, is something that is not so readily accessible in the liberal movements. (I wrote about what our approach to intermarrieds should be here: http://ejewishphilanthropy.com/inclusivity-doesnt-cut-it-toward-a-new-conversation-on-intermarriage/)

 Our organization, J-Journey, is designed to offer support to intermarried families who want to explore Orthodox Judaism and help them access resources to do so. Already, we have received a steady stream of inquiries, and I do believe there are many intermarrieds out there who are yearning for something more than simply the wholesale acceptance with no strings attached that occurs in many of the more liberal settings.

Thanks again for taking the time to review &quot;Doublelife.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;As it stands now, we discourage intermarriage so vociferously that orthodox rabbis will not officiate the ceremony of an intermarried couple.&lt;/i&gt;

C&#039;mon Eli, you know better than to write a misleading statement like that.

It&#039;s not that &quot;we&quot; (the Orthodox rabbinate) &quot;discourage&quot; (shy away from) officiating at an interfaith marriage.

A union between a Jew and a Gentile is simply not kiddushin.

That would be like saying &quot;we discourage shechting camels for kosher meat&quot;  Camels aren&#039;t kosher, no matter how we feel about it.

That all being said -an Orthodox synagogue is going to be more welcoming to an interfaith couple, precisely because we don&#039;t solicit for conversion.  Everyone is welcome at services and shabbat meals.

It&#039;s already cliché that the non-Jewish partner drags the non-frum Jewish partner along, in increasing levels of halachic observance.

Non-frum groups have quickie &quot;conversion&quot; semester classes.  They want the Gentile partner to pay for that class, and then pay membership dues.  Refusing to perform an interfaith wedding is a way for R/C to increase attendance at those classes, and boost their Temple membership numbers.]]></description>
