		<description><![CDATA[the bomberg edition of 1520 was the very first COMPLETE talmud to be printed. Soncino and Pisaro had a few tratctates that were printed earlier, but nothing complete. if there is a place for me to email to, i also snapped a photo of the 1520 venice edition of sota 47a. this edition still has the story of yeshu and his rebbi and how/why he was thrown out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another little nitpick: the first printing of Tr. Sanhedrin was probably the late 1497 printing by Soncino.  C.B. Friedberg in 1958 lists 20 tractates printed at Faro between 1487 and 1492 (Portugal), including Sanhedrin, but I don&#039;t know if any fragments remain to prove it.  This from Haberman, Maamar al Hadpasat haTalmud; and Heller, Printing the Talmud.



I recently acquired a 1720 Frankfurt Sanhedrin, 43a has the big blank space.  Interestingly, I also have Gittin from that edition, and the passage on 57a about Yoshke&#039;s punishment is a blank space in the middle of the text.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As xkcd points out: http://xkcd.com/1053/

&quot;For each thing &#039;everyone knows&#039; by the time they&#039;re adults, every day there are, on average, 10,000 people in the US hearing about it for the first time.&quot;

And as the alt-text of the comic notes, &quot;Saying &#039;what kind of idiot doesn&#039;t know about the Yellowstone supervolcano&#039; is so much more boring than telling someone about the Yellowstone supervolcano for the first time.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[very interesting article indeed. just to clarify, the first venice edition (shas vinitzia) of the Talmud was printed by Daniel Bomburg already in 1520. i believe that 1549 was actually his fourth and final edition. My family is in possession of the first edition. no promises, but i will try and get you a picture of daf 43 and the binding with the shaar blatt so you see the year. there is a cute anecdote about Bomberg. He was a christian printer and apparently a real oheiv yisroel. one of the reasons why he was involved in printing jewish books was because he kind of felt that he owed something back to the community. The only people that were able to read back then were the jews and the priests. so naturally, he employed the jews for his printing press. As a thank you, he published our seforim as well. the funny thing is that many people that look at the front page and see his name in hebrew, think he is doniel not daniel. meaning, they think he is a jew. what confuses them more is that the final books that he printed, were only completed after he died. so they printed his name in front as daniel bomberg z&#039;l. for sure a yid LOL. anyway, thanks for the read!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;On the eve of Passover Yeshu was hanged. For forty days before the 
execution took place, a herald went forth and cried, &quot;He is going forth 
to be stoned because he has practiced sorcery and enticed Israel to 
apostasy. Any one who can say anything in his favour, let him come 
forward and plead on his behalf.&quot; But since nothing was brought forward 
in his favour he was hanged on the eve of the Passover! &quot;     



I am wondering why the Church would want to censor this.  It gives evidence 
that Jesus existed.  It would seem more likely that the rabbis removed 
it because it was incriminating,   but then why would there be a censor 
stamp over it.   It seems unwise to have included this in the talmud at all.   

Perhaps, there wasn&#039;t the same feeling in Bavel in the 400&#039;s as there would have been in other parts of the Roman Empire.]]></description>
