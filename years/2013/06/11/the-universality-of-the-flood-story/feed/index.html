WHY would you waste the time and energy to mutter 3,000 Hebrew words in rapid succession, in a room of others who actually believe that they are communicating with the Creator of the Universe, in a manner prescribed by Jewish Sages, 2,000 years ago???

I don&#039;t believe that you don&#039;t believe.

Whatever personal events have transpired to cast a curse of melancholia on your soul, you know intrinsically the Truth of Hashem and His Torah, or you wouldn&#039;t be doing something as pointless (for a real atheist) as going to Shacharis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Funny comparison

Do you do follow of santas laws? Do you live in a community that davens to him 3 times a day?  That talks constantly about how much rachmanis santa has, that all of our parnasah comes fromhim?  Does santa tell you to cover up your women? And that women cant be in leadership positions in the church of santa?  How about santas country?  Do you have a country just for santa followers?  

You think i am wasting my time, thats fine.  For me, its therapy.  I feel better when i come and read stuff and write stuff and get it off my chest.

No excuse me while i go to shacharis]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is not that everyone has a flood story. Like you
said, that should strengthen the historicity of the mabul. The problem is that much
of parshas Bereishis and Noach mirror ANE mythology, and that, together with
the geological, archeological, and other scientific evidence against a
world-wide flood, suggests that parshas Noach is just another retelling of a
popular myth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;The presence of competing flood narratives from the rest of the ancient world gives us pause.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;


I&#039;ve heard this before - that somehow we&#039;re supposed to doubt the accuracy of the account in Beresheet , because everyone else has a flood story.


Of course everyone has a flood story!  Everyone in the world is descended from Noakh and his three sons, Shem, Kham, and Yafet.  Of course they would talk about the most amazing experience of their lives, to their children and grandchildren.  It makes perfect sense that every culture preserved the factual account that there was a Great Flood; even if they inadvertently filled in the details differently over the centuries.


And if one will ask, &quot;if they altered the details in the other flood stories, how do you know that the Israelites did not alter the details of their account?&quot;


That is simple: our account was given to us directly by Gd on Mount Sinai.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;orthodox Jews have a tendency to think that we have a monopoly on drush.&quot;

Thats because there is always a source for the explaination or chiddush!  Yu cant just make up stuff, there needs to be a m&#039;kor


 &quot;It is our job to find eternal meaning in these stories because they were given to us as eternal stories&quot;

Its our job?  Really?  And only because our uneducated, farmer grandparents told us the story??  Man, that sounds shallow

Occam razor says there is no deeper meaning or anything else, it is just a made up story]]></description>
