		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, well, on this round, a man like Lipman, who is trying to support those on the bottom who want change is being battered by a spokesperson for the leaders of that community who do not want to let their followers have the opportunities created by secular literacy and exposure. He is bent on denying them the benefits of his U Chicago BA and Ivy League law degree that make him an effective propagandists. We need honest dialogue, not demagogues.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;They now care enough, I hear, to have invited Jonathan Rosenblum for a counterpoint.&quot;

I think it&#039;s important to hear his perspective, and debate what one diasgrees with. He makes good points in an essay the Jewish Action published in 2004(available online):

“the Chareidi community is by nature an evolutionary, not a revolutionary, one. What changes take place will come in an incremental fashion, primarily generated by pressures from below…An entire body of social science literature documents the disastrous consequences of many efforts at social and ecological engineering, and the frequency with which those efforts generate consequences far more grievous than the problems they are designed to cure(Jewish Action, Summer 2004, “Israel’s New Economic Reality: Will Israel’s Charedi Population Have To Reinvent Itself?”).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Lipman is in the same party as Yair Lapid? And Lapid’s father, Tommy,
 was virulently anti-orthodox? Lipman must also be anti-orthodox! The 
RCA asked Lipman to speak? The RCA must agree with everything Yair Lapid
 says too! BAYT invited Lipman for Shabbos? BAYT is clearly anti-Torah.

                These are the arguments being made.&quot;

              In this case, I think that both BAYT and the RCA are well aware of the controversial nature of Rabbi Lipman&#039;s opinions and I  think it&#039;s fair to say that the invitations to Rabbi Lipman were extended precisely because they wish to show  a measure of support for him and his stances.  You can hardly apply the tag &#039;McCarthyism&#039; when he is invited to be the keynote speaker at the RCA convention; such an invitation, particularly during the heat of the debate certainly can be  understood to be a show of support (if not an endorsement.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Its seems that the spokesmen for the Haredi community have been the MKs, a few Gedolim, and like you said Yated. The statements have been very reactionary about how yesh atid wants to destroy torah, and have not offered any alternatives. I don&#039;t understand why there is such vehement opposition to any secular studies. However, I am not convinced that all the Haredim in Israel think like this. I believe many of them would like to have some English and Math in the curriculum so them can have more options after high school. However, it seems the moderates have been primarily silent. Are they afraid to be marginalized to speak out?  Rav Fink, what is your take on this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I was in yeshiva, one of my rabbeim used to say over a yiddish expression that translates loosely to &quot;as the non-Jews so, so the Jews go as well.&quot;

The negative rhetoric and guilt-by-association tactics is similar to the highly partisan discussions you hear in Washington and in most discussions of American politics these days. 


On another note, subtlety and nuance are a thing of the past. People like Chris Christie (who I&#039;m not a fan of) and Jon Huntsman get ripped every time they say something that deviates from the party line.

Many parts of the Orthodox Jewish media operate with soundbites and out-of-context quotes.   We have kol koreis instead of tshuvos with detailed analyses of the issues. 

It&#039;s time to change the tone of the discourse out there. I am honestly sick and tired of the sinas chinam out there. Chareidi, modern, yeshivish, chassidish, whoever, whatever. No use in pointing fingers because no group is guiltless. But I&#039;d love to see things change out there, and the ideas in this post are certainly a step in the right direction.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes.  We are going in the wrong direction, but at the same time we do have some real leaders.  Dov Lipman is one such because he is willing to accept the arrows for doing what is right.  We will be ok as long as we have some leaders like Rabbi Lipman, and Rabbi Stav and Rabbi Amsalam who are willing to stand on the principal of Jewish unity.  There is an old saying that you know that you are closing in on the target when you start taking a lot of anti-aircraft fire.]]></description>
