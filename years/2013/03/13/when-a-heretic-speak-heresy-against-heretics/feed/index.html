		<description><![CDATA[Nagel is a rigorous thinker, and makes most of his reasoning transparent for the educated layperson, which is refreshing.  His writing is free from polemics, and merely attempts to get to the heart of an issue through rational thinking.  He writes a cogent summary of the public education and intelligent design debate, but delineates the flaws in reasoning of the scientific establishment in its opposition to intelligent design in a straightforward way, that is worth reading: http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1172/papa_132.pdf

Of course he is an atheist, but most of his writings are free from polemics, and he is refreshingly honest.  He even admits to a bias against theistic belief, but admits to the fact that it is a bias, rather than withholding that fact from the reader through the use of rhetoric.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) I have not read the book either, but Nagel is about as prominent as it gets in American Philosophy, and I highly doubt he is using pseudoscience.  His views of the mind-body problem are widespread (but I believe his is a prominent source of these ideas) among philosophers of the mind.  Nagel himself has been highlighting the issue since the 70s. 


My guess, is that the controversy blew up now because he is using a philosophical problem to challenge a scientific premise.  


2) Your points about the difference between fundamentalist Orthodox Judaism and science are valid, but I think that Orthodox Judaism and Science are quite analogous.  Established positions within Orthodox Judaism are difficult to change, but they can and have changed.  Within the paradigm of Orthodox Jewish scholarship questioning and innovation are encouraged.  What is discouraged is the questioning of the structure of the paradigm itself.  You have to play within the rules of the game.  Science works in a similar fashion.  Questions and innovation are encouraged so long as they function within the rules of the game.  Using philosophy to question the validity of a scientific theory appears to be outside the rules and hence the firestorm.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t label all philosophy as pseudoscience, since that word carries a negative connotation. The only philosophy I would label as such is one which makes hard scientific claims despite not having a hard scientific basis upon which to argue. In other words, the blurring of boundaries is the issue, not the particular discipline.


As to your accusation of irony... well, you may be right. Touche.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) All philosophy is pseudoscience. I have no idea if his ideas are popular or not, nor is that relevant to this post.


2) You are correct and I don&#039;t disagree that there are huge distinctions between religious orthodoxy and scientific orthodoxy. Their similarity wasn&#039;t even the main point here. The point is that unorthodoxy is always met with non-subtantive attacks.


And ironically, or maybe not, you are using the same fallacious argument in your last point! I am not giving credence to anything. If those erroneous views use untruths to support their claim, rebut them! Don&#039;t blame me! (Or Nagel!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not entirely clear about Nagel&#039;s position, but I have listened to a talk from David Chalmers, another philosopher who deals extensively with the &quot;problem&quot; of consciousness, and I don&#039;t think they step outside the bounds of human perception and understanding.  


They don&#039;t use teleological explanations at all.  Chalmers, at least, has devoted his efforts to highlighting the questions that need to be answered.  I don&#039;t think that he, or Nagel, have even suggested any answers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My understanding (I am not a philosopher) is that philosopher&#039;s use different categories of consciousness.  I think that some of these are relatively easy to infer in some animals.  There are other types of consciousness, however, about which there is great controversy. 

I think that the way we infer other humans are conscious at these higher levels is from their descriptions of what they are feeling, thinking and believing.  Obviously, such descriptions are hard to come by from animals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have two issues with your post:

1) With the caveat that I&#039;m unfamiliar with Nagel and his work, your description of it makes it sound a lot like pseudoscience, and as such, it has little place in scientific debate. The likely (perhaps unintentional)  main audience of his research, despite his own atheism, is the religious community, and any popularity of his views are likely the result of confirmation bias.

2) Although I understand why you make the analogy, the fact remains that a faith based community, such as Fundamentalist Orthodox Judaism, is &lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; different from the scientific community. Fundamentalist communities brook no dissent whatsoever, as you pointed out. The scientific community, while not without its own biases and &quot;orthodoxy&quot;, is, by its very nature, open to dissent. Established theories may be hard to overturn, but the possibility exists, and most scientists do believe in the scientific process. Peer review guarantees this. It&#039;s far from a perfect system, as the community is comprised of imperfect human beings, but the basic system is one that encourages challenges. It is an old trope of the religious right that science is just another set of blind beliefs. They use that notion to dismiss evidence of an old earth, or global warming, and anything else that doesn&#039;t conform to their viewpoint. By drawing the analogy you do, you are giving credence to the views of people like that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That’s the problem of other minds, no? Technically, you can’t be sure that other humans are conscious, either, only yourself, because you can’t experience another’s mind. You infer that they are conscious because they behave
in ways similar to the way that you behave as a result of your being conscious.
The same way we can make that inference about other humans, we can make it
about other things that might have conscious minds, like primates or AIs.

There are expirements, like the mirror test, that have shown that some other species display behaviors that show they are self-aware: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_test]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi - one of your favorite terms &quot;meme&quot; was coined by Dawkins - as you yourself reminded  me. If you step back, creating the &quot;meme concept&quot; was essentially his attempt to expand the evolutionary concept into the metaphysical sphere, by saying that ideas &quot;evolve&quot; along the same lines as DNA, thus the laws of Evolution are as immutable as the laws of Gravity. And that the metaphysical world was basically a physical reality about which we didn&#039;t know enough yet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The only similarity seems to be that the motivation to attack is not only based on dispassionate academic analysis. I&#039;ll concede that there is more driving the attacks on Nagel and his book than his arguments being wrong.  

But can you imagine how much different things would have been for Slifkin had the banners written thorough responses to Slifkin&#039;s arguments?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve agreed with you that Slifkin&#039;s books were banned because they challenged an orthodoxy. And I guess there is some superficial relation between the arguments used by Tropper (people will go off the derech) and those used by, say, Brian Leiter (Nagel&#039;s book will be used to support teaching ID as science). But notice the difference: Leiter wrote a thorough and devastating critique while Tropper got the book banned by doing nothing more than pointing to bad consequences. There&#039;s a fundamental difference between how the academy deals with heresies and how the Chareidi world does.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nagel&#039;s book is controversial in the scientific world, and maybe in his linking the issue to new-darwinism, but the non-materialist viewpoint of consciousness is very common among philosophers in that area and has been for a few years already. 

Lots of philosophical papers on the issue can be found here: http://consc.net/online/1]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen very little criticism of only the second type. Can you link to some?

The arguments against Slifkin&#039;s conclusions, when any were made, were usually appeals to authority or other fallacies. Only a small handful of people (FKM most prominently) actually addressed any of Slifkin&#039;s arguments. It&#039;s clear that the ban was not because Slifkin&#039;s arguments lacked merit but because they reached conclusions that the Charedi world found inappropriate.

That is not the case with Nagel.  I&#039;ve read at least 5 substantive responses from philosophers hammering his arguments. Sure there might be some professional polemists who attack Nagel only for supporting ID (a charge that is not without merit by the way), but they are a small minority. He is being attacked for making bad arguments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Including the one thing that makes humans different than animals, that is, our consciousness. 

What makes you think that only humans are conscious? “Animals” is not a homogenous group, standing opposite “humans.” Ants probably aren’t conscious, but chimps probably are, and dolphins might be. 

I can’t comment on the book, having first heard of it in this post, but it’s a strange contention given that neuroscientists are mapping more and more of the brain and discovering which parts of the brain give rise to various experiences.

To your main point, yes, it’s interesting how defending a group’s core beleifs is often deemed more important than the truth.]]></description>
