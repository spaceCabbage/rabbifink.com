the neck is cut, quality of knife, stun gun before or after shechita, 
checking of lungs, removal of forbidden fats and the back end with 
siattic nerve, and salting meat.&quot; - You 100% sure of that? Let&#039;s go down to Astoria Queens TOGETHER and interview and watch the various owners and go through their procedures and how they keep their costs low. You&#039;ll be shocked. I started buying Hallal meat instead.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not sure why you think that kosher meat companies don&#039;t deserve to make money like any other business. Muslim meat standards are just cutting the neck with no concern for how the neck is cut, quality of knife, stun gun before or after shechita, checking of lungs, removal of forbidden fats and the back end with siattic nerve, and salting meat. Muslims do not have any of those requirements and the kosher meat company must pay for skilled individuals. You get what you pay for.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with most of your points. However, ALL kosher meat companies should be forced to open up their books. There is too much profiteering coming at the expense of the pashoot yid. The Islamic community does a much better job at keeping their expenses to a minimum to allow all of Allah&#039;s followers to take great pleasure in the laws of Muhammad PBUH. Not every Jew out there can afford to keep paying the ever increasing price to maintain a kosher lifestyle. Open up the books. Religion and Business do not mix and if you try to mix it Hashem drives a strong hand down.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Weiss, im unclear as to why you would put your GOOD NAME on the line to help a ganuv get his business back. If this scum bag ganuv who deceived many people in YOUR community, cared about his business he would not have commited this CRIME and SIN. if his business falls apart, he has no one to blame but HIMSELF. the fact that you want to come to his rescue puzzles me. Let mike&#039;s business fail. when it does, the members of YOUR community who are concerned about kosher can find a new vendor to replace doheney, one that sells actual kosher meat, one that has owners who dont try and cheat us. 




Rabbi, explain to us why Doheney deserves a second chance? they were not set up. the made their bed and now they must sleep in it.


If the RCC gives them back a certification I will not trust ANY rcc establishment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Modern Orthodox community has an amazing opportunity right now, and I hope this scandal is not in vain. This scandel broke during the Parsha of Shemini, which as Hashgacha Pratis would have it discusses the laws of kosher animals. The MO community has an opportunity to change American standards for kashrus. There are 3 parts to consumerism; Cost, Quality, and Turn Around. If you want cheap Kosher meat on hand daily then it wont be good quality. Either in the actual meat, or in the standards involved making it kosher. Instead of wasting time speculating, lets figure out how this will never happen again. That means demanding transparency from Hekshur Rabbonim, demanding fulltime mashgichim for any establishment who has keys, not the owner. This means the cost of Kosher food costs more and we are willing to pay it so we know the highest standards are met. The credibility of a goy vs a frum yid with a beard means NOTHING, as per the Monsey scandal. The Mashgichim also must be treated better by the Hekshurs. You want a Mashgiach with yiros shamyaim who would never compromise on standards yet you wont pay for 2 so they can daven like a mentsch. We have created this monster by letting the Rabbis profit more and more without any raising of actual standards anywhere.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have never seen this, and would be concerned if I did, but at the end of the day that is why there&#039;s a difference between an owner who is basically trustworthy and one who is not.   If the mashgiach knows that he&#039;s basically an honest person, then he can relax his supervision to the mere level that the shulchan aruch requires, which allows for taking breaks.  If he&#039;s not, then he must be watched like a hawk, far beyond what the SA requires.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It wouldn&#039;t matter if he weren&#039;t Jewish.   Suppose you have a genuine idolater, who is also a convicted  con man, and he offers to work as a bank teller with two mashgichim looking over his shoulder at all times, and counting the money before and after he touches it, is there a reason not to hire him?   Well, yes, I think there is, because he might be a skilled con man who can steal even under all that supervision, but it&#039;s not unreasonable to say no, now that we know about him we can supervise him adequately.  We know not to trust him, and once we verify that he&#039;s doing it right what&#039;s the problem?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;The video shows a fence and I am told there is no such fence at Doheny on Pico.&lt;/i&gt;

You&#039;re &lt;i&gt;told&lt;/i&gt;?!  You&#039;re certifying that the place is kosher, and you didn&#039;t even visit the place to check whether the fence exists?!

&lt;i&gt;What happened at the butcher in the Valley was definitely shady, but 
there is no evidence that anything similar occurred at Doheny.&lt;/i&gt;

So you admit that even by his own account, Mike was engaged in something shady, and yet you don&#039;t cavil at giving him a hechsher?!   If you know he&#039;s a dishonest person how can you trust that he won&#039;t cheat you?

&lt;i&gt;As far as the public knows, and we have no reason to think othewise, the
 RCC does not claim that there was non-kosher meat on site.&lt;/i&gt;

That&#039;s right.  They can&#039;t know what meat was illegally brought in.  It&#039;s technically &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt; that it was Bet-Yosef-standard glatt kosher, shechted by a tzadik who sharpened his challef with tears.  It&#039;s possible, but what odds would you give on it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this isn&#039;t about defaming, this is about the TRUTH.  I&#039;ve seen enough footage and the fact that you are trying to sweep this under the rug is quite sad, and more so, irresponsible.  The jewish community deserves to know what is going on here--it&#039;s so typical of us to try to sweep things that are difficult to face under the rug--but the footage will keep coming.  You can&#039;t deny the evidence
The fact is that treif was being sold to the community for at least 6 months, if not several years.  How about sticking up for the community that was cheated?  No?  You prefer to stick up for someone who so clearly cheated every Jew in LA and SFV that keeps kosher??  The footage will keep rolling.  That I can promise you.  Stay tuned to the media who will continue to blow the lid off of this.   You can&#039;t hide from the truth.  Sorry.  I hope you saw KTLA, more stories to follow all day today and this weekend.  BTW, I really don&#039;t care about Doheny.  I have no personal investment in this pig.  None.  But I am personally invested in truth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand why, according to halacha, one must be judge the Rabbis l&#039;Kaf zechus.
This means that we should say that, even if the charges here are true, it does not mean that the Rabbis were part of a conspiracy to foist treifos on an unsuspecting community.
Rather, they -- and the mashgiach -- were deceived.


However, how is it that the obligation of judging l&#039;kaf zechis extends to a butcher who has apparently been caught on video doing something highly suspicious and is said to be not fully committed to Torah and mitzvos?  


I would appreciate someone&#039;s citing a source.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a person who keeps commenting on this blog, using the name &quot;Truth&quot; or &quot;Just Tell the Truth&quot; who obviously has an interest in defaming Doheny Glatt or its owner and now the new supervising Rabbi. His comments are filled with what seems like non-factual information and full of hate. I wonder if this the same person who may have hired the investigator or a competitor who wants Doheny shut. 


We all agree that there are a number of unanswered questions. Who hired this investigator? Why? Is this information credible? What is the official RCC response? 


What we do understand is that going forward as of yesterday, there is a new supervising Rabbi who had Deheny replace all open boxes of meat, hired two full-time mashgichim, changed the locks, the only key for the store is held by one mashgiach, added CCTV cameras and is only providing his supervision until April 1st, this way customers can purchase Glatt Kosher meat during the holiday.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s do the math:
(conservatively)


12 boxes in one minivan.


50 lb per box.


treif vs kosher = $5 lb cheaper.


600 lb x $5  = $3,000 per day, $18,0000 per week, $1,000, 000 per year..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pretty obvious what was likely going on here, now that we&#039;ve seen the latest video:

Doheny&#039;s  B--i-L  has a bossor bossor meat business w/ (or without) minimal kosher supervision.

1. B-I-L easily buys treif, given minimal or nonexistent supervision.

2, B-I-L loads van with treif meat, using forged Aaron&#039;s Best stickers and packed in used boxes he got from Doheny&#039;s. 

3. Meat is transferred to Doheny van at -appropriately - McDonald&#039;s parking lot.

4. Doheny&#039;s moves it into their warehouse while mashgiach disappears to go to Shacharis.

Interested to know what hashgacha, if any, was had by B-I-L&#039;s bosor bossor operation, which made it so easy for him to acquire the treifos and smack on the counterfeit labels.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The RCC and their henchmen all of who have been quiet and basically in &quot;hiding&quot;since this scandal broke should be ashamed of themselves. It still doesn&#039;t answer the basic simple question of if there was a problem with the kashrut there wether it was just non Glatt or treif does not answer why on earth anyone would be defending this clown Mike who also has yet to come out and make a statement. The chain reaction of his food has basically hit most local frum homes and if or not they want to be somech on a heter it isn&#039;t very clear. But again Weiss or if you call yourself Rabbi Weiss why on earth are you trying to help this fereyeh Israeli guy who was definetly doing something shady all of a sudden being made a tzadik and why are you trying to help him get his &quot;credibility&quot; back ? There are a dime a dozen other local stores that don&#039;t have any allegations against them just go there and not in the front of your mind be thinking am I doing something smart now as this establishment until clarified may of been selling me product that was labeled otherwise. Once clarified if all was good then I&#039;m sure he will get his hechsher back but of course if found out that it was treif I hope the community lynch this man and burns the store down ]]></description>
