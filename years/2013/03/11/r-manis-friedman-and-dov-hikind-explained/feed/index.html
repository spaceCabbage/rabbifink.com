		<description><![CDATA[You have no stance

you contradict what you wrote in the article by quickly agreeing with people that contradicted you? I think you agree with what you wrote as there is truth to &quot;insular&quot; notion.

But you definitely don&#039;t agree with everything j efram wrote!

you write well but don&#039;t just be smart or cute in your writing without really knowing what your stance is or you will end with egg on your face as well.



And by the way I dont think you or any of your commentors below understand Manis or what he said. And its a shame because if people really understood him there would be a lot more healing and in a much quicker fashion than what the abused and their families are provided today.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don’t think it can. At best, the sensitivity will be patronizing or along the lines of getting along with the goyim so they don’t hurt us. Real sensitivity involves understanding that the other person is a person just like you.

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; I don&#039;t condone it, but lack of diversity can&#039;t be called objectively evil.

Not in itself, no. But the inability to see other’s practices as anything but weird and wrong and the inability to see that others as people just like yourself is at the root of a lot of evil.

Without taking it to that extreme, though, it’s still bad because that way of relating to the world effects the way one acts – as you point out in your post.]]></description>

In Hikind&#039;s case, just knowing that there&#039;s a social media out there should have been enough of a deterrent.  But Friedman is another matter: he WROTE the book on tsnius, &quot;Doesn&#039;t Anyone Blush Anymore?&quot;, so his [recorded] pronouncements about his view of the nature of sex abuse [not making a bracha is worse!!!] should lead to nothing less than his being defrocked.

		<description><![CDATA[If the woman is of higher status she or her father will refuse the marriage and the 50 silver pieces (plus standard damages) fine will serve as the deterrent.  The marriage isn&#039;t forced on the girl, it is only forced on the man (evidence that it is meant as a deterrent).

On the contrary the Torah is very shy about physical punishment in practical terms.  It is extremely difficult for anyone to actually receive corporal punishment.  And would be even more unlikely in the case of rape (if there was a such a punishment on the books). 

Furthermore, if the woman is an erva to the man (which in modern times applies to almost all women), the woman and any bystanders have the right and duty to stop the rape by any means, including killing the assailant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty sure it is not merely a deterrent or a social mobility scheme for lower status women - and what about raping a higher status young woman? A good way for a guy to social climb, huh? The Torah isn&#039;t shy about physical punishment, which also could act as a deterrent. As Rabbi Fink says, we don&#039;t practice this any more than we do slavery. Clearly something about it doesn&#039;t work with the world we know or our moral compass.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Torah doesn&#039;t &quot;condone&quot; rape marriage.  It proscribes as a punishment for the rapist, that he must marry his victim (assuming she wants to get married).  It is a deterrent. 


Consider the classic medieval scenario of the noble born young man that rapes the peasant girl.  If he knew he would have to marry her (and not deny her any marital rights), he would thing twice about using his standing and power to take rape young women of lower status.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think diversity, as it is normally understood, is an objective value. It is not an end onto itself.  It is a means by which greater tolerance, broadness of mind, and empathy can be achieved.  

Diversity as a means has downsides as well.  It can lead to moral relativism, it can lead to indifference to others within the community, and it can lead to ethnic strife. 



Diversity to work has to be done right. But the dynamics in every community and setting are hard to predict. 


I will say, that as far as diversity within the frum community you are absolutely right.  Thankfully, the sort of viewpoints you discuss are relatively rare.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, diversity objectively is a value to be embraced, and not doing so hurts the frum world even within its own insular space.  Even diversity within the frum world is poorly tolerated.  In many communities, people with special needs have to be kept under wraps.  Some communities won&#039;t accept legitimate converts.  Girls wearing different legwear get spit on.  And so on.]]></description>

That is not necessarily a bad thing. It usually will result in some egg on your face, but overall, it could be okay. Look, I don&#039;t condone it, but lack of diversity can&#039;t be called objectively evil.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Diversity is rare and not especially valued. This is not necessarily a bad thing. 

 

Yes, it is, because it creates a community that has great difficulty seeing someone else’s point of view. I’m not talking about accepting other’s way of living, just the ability to understand where they’re coming from and why they do what they do. Instead community norms are assumed to be universal norms, and anyone who deviates from those norms is strange at best and often portrayed as evil and depraved.

 

It’s unfortunately the default way all people look at the world, but those who have contact with people different from themselves can learn that the norms they take for granted are just social constructs. Those that only interact with people exactly like themselves rarely examine their
norms. But then, that’s the whole reason for being insular, isn’t it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dov Hikind is an assemblyman.  He&#039;s exposed to outsiders; if no one else, his fellow assemblymen.  It&#039;s possible that he even represents a few constituents who aren&#039;t Orthodox Jews.  (Whether they voted for him or not, he still represents them).  That&#039;s why more knowledge of the outside world is expected of him.]]></description>
