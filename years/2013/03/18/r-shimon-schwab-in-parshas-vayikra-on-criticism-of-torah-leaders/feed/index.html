		<description><![CDATA[Ksil, you are either working in an incredible company or you have a very naive view of the corporate world.  The norm in the corporate world is that you bend over backwards not to criticize your boss.  You can criticize the competitor, the enemy, sure.  But you take your job into your hands if you criticize your company. 


Don&#039;t confuse criticism from an outsider with criticism of an insider.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In both those situations the initial criticism and the driving force behind the issues were from people who were not followers of the President.  What Isaiah and Rabbi Schwab are discussing is when the followers are pointing out the mistakes, protesting the mistakes, of their leaders. 


That is something that is quite rare even in modern times.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are confusing the criticism of enemies and outsiders with the criticism of underlings and insiders.  I don&#039;t know if the President sanctions criticism from his underlings.  I would hope he does, but I don&#039;t know. 


I do know, however, that it is very, very common for employers not to accept criticism from their employees (or accept only in a moderated form).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No.  There&#039;s a special kind of narcissism that seems to distinctly permeate the rabbinic world (perhaps other clergy too, but I wouldn&#039;t know).  They think they have all the answers can handle problems that in other professions would be recognized as being outside the scope of their expertise.   

A couple examples:  (1) On the topic of Orthodox homosexuals, the rav of my shul commented that he felt they had a choice because of the success of JONAH.  I commented that from what Ive read that type of therapy was very dangerous and could be very damaging.  He responded with :&quot;That&#039;s just the opinion of the secular  psychologists.&quot;   Well... Who is he disagree?!   Since when don&#039;t you accept the advice a rabbi over medical professionals in matter pertaining to health?    But. he&#039;s not alone in that view that rabbis know better.   (2) RHS suggesting that a panel of Rabbi psychologists can conduct their own investigation to determine probable cause.

These are just a couple big examples from a RWMO perspective.  When you look to the right, the narcissism gets event worse a la &quot;Daas Torah.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sigh. No it isn&#039;t. Does the president of the United States not expect criticism? Does he not sanction it? On the contrary, would it occur to him that he wouldn&#039;t get it?

I agree that this is nice as far as it goes because it is so far out of the box for the frum world. But, boy, what an embarrassment that it is - and actually I do pity people who honestly need Rav Schwab&#039;s permission to have a critical thought - which anyway people like Rav Schwab himself would expect to be the judge of whether or not the criticism was valid or fair.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whatever happened to a modest people? Whatever happened to ואהבת לרעך כמוך? 
Even in a situation where criticism of a gadol is necessary, that doesn&#039;t give every random Joe the right to publicly harangue him, or negate the need for a certain level of sensitivity (which you have, R&#039; Fink, but many of your commenters clearly lack). Everyone has to have an opinion; the more outrageous it is, the harsher the attack, the more people know about it - the more points you win.
I don&#039;t want to speak to the topic that brought this all on, but let me point everyone back to where the original article is from - hardly the beacon of Jewish values and respect we should be taking example from.
