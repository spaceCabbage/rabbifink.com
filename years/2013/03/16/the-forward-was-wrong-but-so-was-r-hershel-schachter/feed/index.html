		<description><![CDATA[He can class it up by cutting out the web trolls, but then he&#039;d catch flack for that as well.  Lieder&#039;s comment was idiotic, and reflects the fact that he didn&#039;t give Rabbi Fink&#039;s post an honest reading.  R&#039; Fink bothers to sit down, organize his thoughts, and give a considered opinion, which is summarily discarded by a douche bag with poor reading comprehension skills.

		<description><![CDATA[You are absolutely wrong on Jewish involvement in the Slave Trade. Check out the researches of Bernard Lewis, the universally recognized authority on the subject, and you will find that the predominant purveyors of slaves were Arab and Black African slavers. Jewish involvement in the slave trade bordered on the negligible to non-existent.
The canard that Jews ran the slave trade was invented by anti-semitic bigots, and self-appointed Afro-American spokesmen, like Leonard Jeffries.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This seems very simple to me.  There is no nuance here, like E Fink and others try to spin!  RHS has no problem with the word shvartzeh in its negative connotation.  None whatsoever, ....now see if you can follow this... THAT IS WHY HE USED THE WORD.  

and #2, he would prefer we NOT go directly to the police any and every time there is a claim of sexual abuse.  Often, he would prefer to consult a shrink or rabbi first...THAT IS WHY HE SAID AS MUCH.  see?

That is why your claim that &quot;I don’t think the Forward was justified in their attack on R’ Schachter &quot; is malarkey to many that disagree with RHS and his views



now go write 3 posts and hundreds of words about the nuance of disagreeing with him, but respecting him and hes not really a racist and he loves blacks and he thinks the police thing with abuse was just in some cases and we need to understand and explain what he was saying. LOL]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, clearly, after such a pattern, the pattern should be identified. After all, isn&#039;t that the essential theory? Give them the chance not to be prejudiced based on skin color. And then what?
Whichever way you can twist it, you can never depart from the fact that it was blacks committing an act of antisemitism. 
I don&#039;t advocate regular white on black prejudice. However, Jews suffered at the hands of THE blacks.]]></description>

The only thing I advocate is tolerance and understanding. Sometimes, it helps to understand what the other side has against you first. Ignorance is the food of intolerance. That is all.

		<description><![CDATA[You cannot deny the awful riots targeted against Jews. 

Do you guys have any idea how many Jews lived in the Bronx? South side of Chicago? Druid hill in Baltimore? Harlem, E. NY,? Jersy City? Newark? South Philadelphia? West Washington DC? Detroit? Roxbury and Dorchester in Boston? Now-slums of LA, Seattle, Miami? And so many more places throughout the US that police won&#039;t even go now?


Don&#039;t shame your people with that kind of idiocy. Did King try to stop it? Did Heshel?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since you clearly have missed the Big Lebowski reference, please allow me to clue you in.


Your argument is made out of ignorance.  Care to support it with facts, figures, perhaps something other than anecdotal evidence?  


Side point.  The Jewish Museum in NY had an exhibit on Jewish involvement with the Civil Rights movement.  I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s still there&gt;  But might I recommend a nice simple Google search?  Especially pay attention to AJ Heschel, who marched with MLK.  


Also, food for thought.  The Jews have not been good to the Africans and African Diaspora either.  While you&#039;re doing your research, also see the Jewish involvement in the slave trade.  They do not teach this in Jewish history--at least not in  my yeshiva.  But it happened.  And most Jews aren&#039;t aware of it, but some groups still hold it against the Jews many years later.  I have been asked about it.  Same way (lehavdil) many Jews out there would react if they met a German nowadays.  That even if this generation of Germans had nothing to do with the Holocaust, many Jews still hold it against them.  Same way some in the African diaspora still have a grudge against Jews, yet many Jews are unaware why.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[you should all keep in mind - agree or don&#039;t agree with R. Schachter - that he essentially is correct. The black community, and more so the black muslim community, unfortunately share an extremely anti-Semitic view of our people. I grew up in a very black city that can&#039;t be too hard to guess - the attitude of these people is so vile, I have never heard anything  like it even from the WASP contingent, of which the city has plenty of as well.
Take for yourselves every large city in America that had a Jewish population by the year 1935 - 40. Can you name me one city where the blacks didn&#039;t riot in SPECIFICALLY Jewish neighborhoods? Find me a metropolitan area that doesn;t have a inner city  where the &#039;Church of Our God&#039; is crudely painted over the Shnei Haluchos, or a beautiful stained glass fresco depicting the Yomim Noraim is plastered with a poster of their despicable savior. For shame!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our country lives on that confidence, but it may be misplaced. This issue has spawned many Facebook discussions and while they all were critical of R&#039; Schachter a surprising number of them took a major tangent on the state of the American justice system and how in so many jurisdictions the mere accusation and preliminary arrest is essentially a jail sentence. Coerced confessions, plea deals for years of prison as opposed to facing life behind bars. Nobody actually delving deep to find the truth. Even your worst-case where your name is eventually cleared has done irreparable harm. And these tidbits were coming from people in the legal system, not just kibbitzers like me.
Essentially, the discussion ended by saying Rabbinic panels don&#039;t work, but neither does our existing system...we&#039;re still stuck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A different aspect of the story in The Forward that is troubling, though, is:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Schachter, whose taped remarks were posted on the Failed Messiah website, said a student at Yeshiva University’s high school in Manhattan confided in him years ago that he had been abused.

Schachter said that he asked the student to tell his story to a rabbi who served as the school psychologist, but the child refused because of the humiliation it could bring on his family.

He said he did not report the abuse to the authorities because he could not be sure the allegations were true.

“So now, 40 years later, the guy’s spilling everything out to the newspaper,” Schachter said in the recording.

Schachter then suggested it was the former student’s fault if more children were harmed because he refused to speak to the psychologist.

He appeared to be referring to Simeon Weber, a former Y.U. high school student who, in previous interviews, told the Forward that he informed Schachter he had been abused by a Y.U. administrator, Rabbi George Finkelstein.

However, there were discrepancies between Schachter’s and Weber’s recollections. Weber said he told Schachter about Finkelstein after he left Y.U.’s high school, when he was a Yeshiva College student, during the early 1980s. He also had no memory of being asked to see a school psychologist.

When asked to comment on Schachter’s remarks, Weber stuck to a carefully worded statement.

“I had the privilege of learning torah with Harav Hershel Schachter for four years,” Weber said. “Though I was far from his best student, I treated him with reverence [and] with the respect due to a true Gadol B’Yisroel [giant of torah].”

Weber added: “Though I am deeply hurt by my rebbe’s comments, my underlying feelings of respect and fond memories of our deep relationship require me to say no more than that the issue itself has to be addressed by those greater than me.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rav Schachter’s raising this issue in public now, while Sullivan &amp; Cromwell’s investigation for YU is underway,  seems imprudent at best.   When do the gaffe excuses run out?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On Friday, I ignored all the articles and blogs and only listened to Rav Schachter on audio.    RHS indeed spends the bulk of the 10 minutes explaining that Mesirah is not what many people think it is.  But the key part is that brief explanation (at the 8 minute mark) of what he thinks is Mesirah:

&lt;blockquote&gt; “State prisons is mamesh hefker. The warden in the prison can kill you – they can put you in a cell together with a – with a – schwartze, they can put you in a cell with a Muslim – a black Muslim who wants to kill all the Jews. Everything is hefker in the state prisons.” It is likely “taka … mesirah”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gaffe aside, the practical conclusion of his position is that RHS agrees with the Agudah postion on reporting of sexual abuse since those cases are usually in State jurisdiction, not federal – and, therefore, fall into Rav Schachter’s exception clause.

Now, one could say (as Gil Student has) the difference between RHS and Agudah  is that RHS “requires approval of COMPETENT AND TRAINED rabbis when the issue isn’t clear. Big difference.”   But, as a practical matter, that means there is no difference, since: a) there is no such institutional infrastructure; and, b) the specific issue is rarely “clear”.

So, the real halachic news here is that RHS is effectively siding with the Agudah on this issue, as opposed to say R. (and Dayan) Broyde who has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Halacha does not prohibit – at all and in any form – the use of secular authorities or courts to investigate, arrest and punish people who engage in such abuse. Maybe in an unjust government and a different time and place these issues might apply, but not in the United States.

There is no need to seek rabbinic license before making such a report to the police. Such reports to the police should be made as soon as possible and expert therapists, social workers and other professionals should be welcomed into our community to help address the consequences of child abuse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;That is, almost every case should be reported to the authorities except in a very small number of unclear situations. That’s okay. I am 99% positive that if you would ask him if I representing his opinion correctly he would say yes.&#039;

That is not what he says or what he means. Its not the default position of the mo community -  go to the police and not to a rabbi mental health professional. basically, his view is the same as the pre-lanner days. also, since most cases of sex abuse crimes all state related and the prisoner goes to a state prison, RHS holds IT IS mesirah; that&#039;s the majority of all sex crimes. 

Its newsworthy and the forward it seems got it right. see what RHS in 2006:

		<description><![CDATA[Most poskim agree. It&#039;s also the official Aguda position.  According to Aguda, you need to go to a rabbi l&#039;varer hadavar - to clarify the facts. Not to get a psak on the mesirah issue. It&#039;s really the same position as RHS.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In Friday&#039;s post your explained R&#039; Schachter&#039;s position this way:

&quot;However, in R’ Schachter’s opinion, one can’t go to the authorities unless one has something to report. Unless a victim can state facts with a fair amount of certainty, there is nothing to report. So if a victim comes forward and says “So and so abused me,” and there is reason to believe the victim, I am under the impression that R’ Schachter holds that one is obligated to go to the authorities.&quot;



Not that you have to defend him but I&#039;m wondering why a psychologist wouldn&#039;t be a more appropriate person to judge whether there&#039;s a case that needs to be reported. (Sorry, I wasn&#039;t participating on Friday, don&#039;t know whether this was addressed).]]></description>
