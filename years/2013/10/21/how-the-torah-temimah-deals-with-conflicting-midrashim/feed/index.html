		<description><![CDATA[This notion of trying to minimize machloqesin in Jewish Thought isn&#039;t limited to midrashic stories. It goes to starting with the assumption that outright philosophical statements should be first approached as agreeing, and only when that fails do we conclude we&#039;re dealing with a dispute.

So you need to not only deal with whether or not to reconcile the stories (for which your conclusion seems inevitable) but also whether or not the message each story imparts can be reconciled. Because of the latter, conflicts between stories do usually pose a challenge, since it&#039;s rare that both narratives can fit the same message even while the stories themselves couldn&#039;t coexist in a single history.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If medrashim are “ independent interpretations” and not “ literal or historical fact” then what value is there in trying to reconcile them? 

It’s taking an anthology of biblical fan-fiction that tries to fill in the back-story and plot holes and find deeper meanings and writing more fan-fiction to fill in its back-story and plot holes and find deeper meanings. Then along will come someone else, collect all of the meta-fan-fiction, and write more to fill in ITS back-story and plot holes and find deeper meanings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;[T]the Gaonim do say that we should try to reconcile midrashim if we can. But they also went on to say that if we cannot reconcile them, then it is no problem.&quot; Which is what R&#039; Eliyahu said is a staple of the acharonim, &quot;tries to reconcile Midrashim and we should first see if we can harmonize&quot;. The first assumption is that they jibe, but it is not an insistence. 



As for &quot;tradition&quot;.... The acharonim have been going for over 500 years now. I think any trend that lasted 500 years qualifies as being a tradition. (Regardless of it being pretty much what you say geonim did as well...)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You lost me here: &quot;The easy answer is that it&#039;s not a question because Midrashim don&#039;t have to reconcile. ... But the Torah Temimah does not answer it that way. Instead he attempts to show that there were two competing theories in Chazal...&quot;

In the first clause, on what level are you saying they don&#039;t have to reconcile: on the story level or the message level? Here, and in nearly all cases, the conflict goes beyond the metaphor and the two different versions of the story do have differences in message.

And if we&#039;re saying that two midrashim don&#039;t have to reconcile even in message, then isn&#039;t that because of dispute between their authors? That, like Ethan Cohen wrote (at around 1:20 PST), it&#039;s no less possible to have a dispute (machloqes) in Jewish Thought as we have in halakhah? In fact it&#039;s more probable, as on most issues the rules of pesaq (finalizing a halachic decision) have no parallel for medrash.

So all-in-all, I&#039;m, not sure how &quot;Midrashim don&#039;t have to reconcile&quot; is different than &quot;there were two competing theories in Chazal&quot;.]]></description>
