		<description><![CDATA[I still can&#039;t figure out why. The frummies consider this no more significant than all the Greek words in Shir haShirim.

		<description><![CDATA[Since this word is part of the narrative of Avraham&#039;s conversation with G-d, as long as Avraham used the word, it makes sense that it would be used in the Torah whether the Torah otherwise uses the words of other languages or not. Torah Temimah does include it as one of numerous examples where other languages are &quot;borrowed&quot; (including referencing the Gemara re: &quot;totafos&quot;), but it&#039;s use here needn&#039;t impact other uses.

Besides, since this is part of the &quot;Book of the Covenant&quot; that was the historical overview presented before the covenant at Sinai was enacted (see http://rabbidmk.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/parashas-bereishis-5774/), using terms that the nation understood in 2448 makes sense. If it was written pre-Sinai, and included in the holy texts studied by the Children of Israel throughout the years even before the exodus (with G-d telling Moshe to include it as is), such language usage fits as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a world of difference between the Torah using a name or proper noun from another language (totophot?) and suggesting that principles of ta&#039;amei hamitzvos are merely accommodations to the cultural milieu in which it was revealed. That (I think) is one of the reasons that the Ramban argues so strongly against the Rambam&#039;s explanation of the reason for korbonos; a) he actually disagrees and b) he feels it opens the door to a relativistic interpretation of the text. 

But of course, no one can get away from the fact that the Rambam actually does suggest a cultural reason for korbonos and we can&#039;t dismiss it just because it raises issues. But it&#039;s an old maklokos and a really don&#039;t think that the Torah Temimah&#039;s attribution of a non-Jew&#039;s name to a non-Hebrew source is such a big deal.]]></description>
