		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink and Tova,
Thank you for sharing Ozzie and Rami with us.
Ozzie and Rami growing up among our community is somthing we love to watch and be a part of.  As Hillary Clinton said, it takes a village to raise a child and the more Aunts and Uncles your children have, the richer their lives will be.
Shana Tova.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You didn&#039;t name him after that Ozzy did you? :-)

I assume his full name is Azriel. I have a good friend named Azriel in Israel and he is called &quot;Oz&quot;.

BTW, Canon came out with some newer compact cameras that can also take HD video (SD960is, 970is, 980is, for example).]]></description>
