		<description><![CDATA[This is a tough question. Expectations of women&#039;s roles have evolved, but the physical and emotional needs of a baby haven&#039;t &quot;modernized&quot; yet. Not everyone agrees with me on that one, though.

There&#039;s an Israeli paraplegic, Keren Leibovich, who had twins (on her own) and went on to win a medal at the Paralympics. She brought her twins and a babysitter along.

You can find interviews with her on the internet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What is she different than regular moms who work? most moms don&#039;t get to take off 2.5 yrs, but have to go back to their jobs after 3 months (in Israel) or a few weeks.

Yes, the kids would benefit from having their mother home all the time, but in our reality, unfortunately, many mothers (and fathers) have to work. So, yes the kids &quot;suffer&quot;,, but there is a certain balance that that amount of suffering has become ok.

And what about Mr. Clijsters? While she was out training, I am assuming he was taking care of the kids more, allowing her to focus. Why does he not get any credit?]]></description>
