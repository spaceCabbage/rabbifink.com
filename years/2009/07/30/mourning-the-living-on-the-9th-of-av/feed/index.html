		<description><![CDATA[Very nice!

One of the best things I read this Tisha B&#039;Av was a comment on Twitter -

http://twitter.com/ASoldiersMother/status/2926665691

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Someone last night asked an amazing question - ponder this. Which do you mourn more, destruction of 1st or 2nd Temple? Answer: Third Temple&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

And my response was -

&lt;i&gt;&quot;@ASoldiersMother Really very good! We mourn over the behavior that is preventing the 3rd(and last)bet hamikdash! Smart and powerful.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

And I truly do believe that we are not mourning a bunch or burnt, twisted, wood, stone, gold, and cloth, but rather mourning the bad behavior that led to the destruction of the Batei Mikdash, and the bad behavior that is currently preventing the building of the third, and final, Bet Mikdash.]]></description>
