		<description><![CDATA[BRAVO RABBI FINK!!!
It is refreshing to see someone take a stand against something that is so highly cherished in the Jewish world, and yet, so baseless in Torah! You mentioned &quot;There may be a place for Segulos in Judaism. What irks me is the proliferation of pop-Segulos. I may have mentioned this with regard to Kupat Ha’ir as well.&quot; Just out of curiosity, I would like to know what role segulos in general have in Judaism? How are they different than this? Is it just that one is pop and one is not? To my simple mind, they all seem like magic. You also gave an alternative to say tehilim instead. Just curious if you have seen the Rambam in Hilchos Avodas Kochavim U&#039;Mazalos 11:12? Wouldn&#039;t this halacha seem to categorize tehilim as &quot;magic&quot; as you put it?

 Thanks again for writing this!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I COMPLETELY disagree with you! I respect your opinion, but it is just that- an opinion. The fact is that you can convince most people of anything, if its portrayed in a &quot;logical&quot; and though out way. So if you read and hear things that sound half smart, most people will automatically agree with it. Its like a teacher- ever heard those &quot;proffessional&quot; speakers give a shiur? The type that most of it is just opinions and ideas that the speaker himself put together, making it fit in with his thesis? Most people leave these classes agreeing with the speaker...until someone, someone who obviously was not present at the shiur, asks them a small question that basically throws off the whole entire shiur. Its like being a lawyer, trying to convince people of something- you have your &quot;argument&quot;, and everyhing you say obviously proves what your are saying right. And the funny thing is that I am doing exactly that just now!
So basically, I congratulate you on your &quot;essay&quot; or whatever it was, and like the other people wrote, it is &quot;well put&quot; and &quot;well said&quot;...but the whole thing is just wrong! I agree with you that we don&#039;t eat to say brachos- of course not! But making brachos parties, I think, is a beautiful thing. And many big Rabonim say so. But aside from that, I really don&#039;t understand WHY you are so against it. People aren&#039;t trying to make &quot;shortcuts&quot;. They are trying to make people more aware of brachos, and of the &quot;power&quot; or whatever you want to call it, of saying amen with kavanah. I went to one of these parties once, and it really inspired me to say brachos properly and not like a robot, and to use these times during the day when saying brachos to really talk to Hashem and daven for people.
And about the &quot;shortcut&quot; thing.... even if people do get &quot;instant gratification&quot; from it, and even if that is their motivation in going to these parties... I honestly don&#039;t think that its so wrong. A basic Jewish principle is Mitoch Shelo Lishmah, Bah Lishmah. You might disagree with everything I am saying, but you can&#039;t disagree that it&#039;s better for these young girls to go to these parties than do who knows what else...
Also, no one says that saying amen is a &quot;magic trick&quot;. People are just trying, like I wrote before, to make people aware of the importance of it.
Also, you wrote that &quot;Judaism is about working hard to follow the Mitzvos and refine one’s character&quot;- I wouldn&#039;t use the words &quot;working hard&quot;, I would say something like &quot;Judaism is about working on ourselves to refine ones character in order to be able to follow the mitzvos, which will ultimately bring us closer to Hashem. And like you already know, I think going to a brachos party actually helps you do this.
And last but not least, when you wrote &quot;If the bored women want to do something to help the world, volunteer at Tomche Shabbos or homeless shelter, or go to a Torah class, or even say some Tehillim&quot;- why are you saying that these things are greater than an amen party? First of all, many amen parties include divrei torah and saying tehillim. Second, many women do both! And third of all, why are you saying that these things are greater than amen parties? Since when do we know the value of mitzvos?]]></description>
