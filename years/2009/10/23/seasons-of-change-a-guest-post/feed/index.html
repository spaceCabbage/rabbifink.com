		<description><![CDATA[Shavua Tov YC - Your association is right on. The teva of the world did change - it had to. The point of the Medrash, as you note, is that not only did the nature of people change to a reduced lifespan of 120 years, but the entire environment of the earth and its nature changed too. The structure of the natural systems of the world must be a matching fit to the nature of the humans which occupy it. As such everything changed and the post-diluvian era was a complete and total fresh start for humanity. It now featured, new systems of nature, new people and even some new rules for us to live by.]]></description>
