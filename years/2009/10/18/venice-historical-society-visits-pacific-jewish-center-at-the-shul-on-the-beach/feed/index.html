		<description><![CDATA[How fab that Harry brought the historical society...  You&#039;re doing such a fantastic job, Rabbi Fink!  We in the northwest only hear great things about the shul and, in particular, your leadership.  Your blog is awesome (how do you do that neato spherical tag list?) and PJC is very blessed to have you and Tova!

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi,
Thank you so much for the wonderful article on the Venice Historical Society&#039;s Movie Tour. We greatly appreciated the invitation to visit your Shul. Your welcome was both inspiring and heartwarming. It was certainly a highlight of the walking tour! We are very lucky to share Harry Medved. He led one of our most successful tours. VHS cannot thank you enough for your support.

And, the VHS will look forward to another visit soon, as we prepare for a Venice Spiritual Landmark Walking Tour.

My best regards,
Jill
Venice Historical Society President]]></description>
