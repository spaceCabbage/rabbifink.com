By the way, Google has most of our emails and web searches as well. Google has everything.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[More likely a webhost has more data on you. Google only asks for your name. Its services are free, so no credit card. A webhost will ask for your name, address and credit card. Both will have the IP address&#039; you used to login (which will allow them to find out who owns the internet account you used to login to them.)

In other words, there is no hiding. At the end of the day, the court can find out who you are.

And frankly, if someone actually libels or otherwise damages another party under the cloak of anonymity, the court has a legitimate and legal responsibility to allow the infringed party to proceed with a claim against the alleged infringer. You cannot use internet anonymity to avoid your legal obligations.]]></description>

You are mistaken. There is NO legal distinction in court between a Google and a private webhosting company providing space for your blog. The court can compel either (Google or your webhost) to reveal all data they have on their customer.]]></description>

Presumably, even if someone self-hosted their blog, the hosting service could also be compelled to reveal their info. There still has to be a server somewhere, and a company behind it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regardless of whether a blog author is disclosed, a worthy opinion or idea should be judged on its merit not on the source.

In the case of an idea that&#039;s merit is less clear, disclosure of the author may bring the blog more or less crediblity. In the absense of that disclosure it has less merit. By the same token there are times when an author (and the reader) might not want the source revealed because they prefer not to sway the argument in this fashion.

Idea&#039;s from the Torah are held to the highest level, but consider how some might view the same text if it were anonymous.

The best example to consider is the ballot box. That must be secret to emcompass both notions -- the ability to voice an opinion without fear of retribution and on the other side not so that no ones opinion carry greater weight than anyones elses.

There are very serious reasons to allow for both instances, to disclose and not.

In most instances disclosure is preferable. One should be willing to stand behind their ideas with the primary exception being the case where the resultant information results in self sensorship.]]></description>
