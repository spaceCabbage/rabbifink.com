		<description><![CDATA[Offwinger:

Great comments. Really.

I am very shtark on this point - watching and following sports is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;entertainment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. All I ask is to be entertained. Taking it more seriously than that by the spectator is ridiculous.

As far as the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;players&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; go it is a completely different story. I am not here to give mussar to millionaires, I am putting it into perspective for the fan. The fan has got to chill out a little. For the fan it is entertainment - remember?

When one is playing sports I demand integrity, sportsmanship, fairness and good attitude. But that&#039;s because it is life for the person playing.

And in response to sanctity of the game, I don&#039;t agree that it is semantics. The way I hear people talk about the records of baseball as holy is more than slightly disturbing. It is to those that I address my opinion. Get a life!

Thanks for commenting, and come by again soon!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem with Favre is not that he is a &quot;traitor.&quot; It&#039;s that he deliberately has played an &quot;I&#039;m retiring. Not I&#039;m not&quot; game to get himself more attention and to try to force people to tell him how much they love him and want him to keep playing.

Favre was NOT a team player in Green Bay when the franchise was interested in transitioning to a younger quarterback (Aaron Rogers). His interests were and always have been Favre-centric, at the expense of the team. This is also true now. Does anyone think the Vikings are better off with Favre having skipped out on training camp until now?

I understand that retiring is an extremely difficult decision for a professional athlete. But most athletes have managed to make this decision privately and with grace. Favre&#039;s failure to do so only amplifies his selfishness.  It&#039;s the same media members or fans who believed Favre represented all that was noble and good in sports &amp; was the true &quot;man&#039;s man&quot; (e.g., Peter King) that are turning on him now. They feel betrayed. Most football fans have long tuned out to the drama of Favre. The Vikings have one of the most exciting players in the NFL. His name is not Brett Favre.

As for the &quot;sanctity of the game,&quot; I think you&#039;re making a semantic point when it comes to the discussion of PEDS.  Yes, there are people who treat sports as a religion, and that is its own separate issue. When many people talk about PEDs ruinng the sanctity of the game, though, they are speaking of a pureness that has to do with fair competition. It has to do with the philosophy of elite sport, and why people care to see what is humanly best.

The reason many people object to PEDs is that using them was both illegal AND against the rules in sports (there is a popular myth that steroids were not banned in baseball during the 1990s - this is completely FALSE). It was cheating, plain and simple.

You say &quot;It&#039;s only a game,&quot; but do you teach your children that it is ok to cheat because when something is only a game? Or do you teach that them they are supposed to follow the rules of the game when they play?]]></description>

Sounds like you might support IDF soldiers&#039; refusal of orders which violate Torah prohibitions.

If so, excellent.

		<description><![CDATA[A great assessment of the situation.

But, it is so utterly ridiculous when you break it down. Sports are entertainment, like a movie, broadway show or board-game. Tying our souls to these sports allegiances is so absolutely inane. It gets exacerbated when an athlete like Favre does what he did, but that only shows further the silliness of it all. It defies explanation - that you could even offer an explanation just shows how ridiculous it is!

		<description><![CDATA[As for Farve himself this real-life soap opera is qualitatively different.  I think that the average NFL career is only 2.5 seasons.  Farve&#039;s longevity and highly unusual length of service WITH ONE TEAM made him Mr. Packer. (I think he was cut by the Falcons as a rookie) Most players are traded at least twice in their career and many are journeymen who bounce from team to team.  there is insuficient time for the fans to link their identity to these transient athletes.

The fans are furious at him because he willfully went over to the hated arch-rival within the division.  Many teams would&#039;ve been glad to extend him a similar contract.  AAMOF had he just said the word he&#039;d STILL be the Jets starting QB and Mark Sanchez would either be elsewhere or hoding a clipboard and learning from the seasoned old pro.  I don&#039;t even thin Woody Johnson would&#039;ve demanded that he surgically repair his slighly torn rotator cuff.  And so his silly little games to secure his release from the Jets and  to blow off the hell of training camp and then un-retir DAVKA withthe Vikings  is correctly seen as a bald manipulation meant to circumvent the clause in his trade to the Jets and to &quot;stick it&quot; to the Packers GM and, by association, to all the cheeseheads.

Hell hath no fury like love to hatred turned.]]></description>
