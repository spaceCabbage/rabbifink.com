		<description><![CDATA[I do not think anyone initially makes a &quot;bad choice&quot;.  We all hope to make the right choice.

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate your insight into the phrase. I agree that equality is necessary for the creation of a free government and that is what the document means. My point is only that equality of rights is not connected with equality of talent or ability.

When we hear ideas like &quot;All men are created equal&quot; and &quot;you can become anything you want&quot; or &quot;in America your dreams are your only limitation&quot; I think there tends to be an overemphasis on these ideas and then it can be translated into a fallacy which I am debunking in the article.

Of course it is unnecessary to raise the point. I do feel it helps raise the issue, maybe in an artistic sort of way, not a technical way.

I do appreciate your insight and I hope you continue to share your thoughts on this blog.

		<description><![CDATA[The phrase All men are created equal in the declaration of independence was a paraphrase of Philip Mazzei &quot;All men are by nature equally free and independent. Such equality is necessary in order to create a free government.
All men must be equal to each other in natural law&quot;.  Under the law is implied in the argument against the devine right of kings.  It is unfortunate this is not clear in the original document - it may have been deluted by concern over its application to slavery - but we unnecessarly  bring it up in discussions of varring human abbilities]]></description>
