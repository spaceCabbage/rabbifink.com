It&#039;s difficult to tell how much of the donation is going toward chinuch in Torah (as per halacha), and how much is going toward excessive levels of administration (dean/head of school plus multiple principals and more) or to excessively luxurious buildings, gyms, secular education (labs, etc), fancy technology (electronic boards, etc). It&#039;s really a very difficult thing to decipher as the schools don&#039;t release any information regarding expenses on Torah versus expenses elsewhere.]]></description>
