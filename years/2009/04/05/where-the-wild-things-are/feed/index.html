		<description><![CDATA[My inner child thought &quot;Those little innocent monsters that look so friendly and inviting become nightmares only if ignored.   Inhibition of basic instinctual natural feelings, centered truth or Nevuah may lead to swimming on the edge of the deep unconscious symbolised universaly as the ocean  that  storms on the surface but can be calm with deep inhabitants that can swallow you up and spit you out on to dry land only if you cannot follow your basic nature.  Ask the dream analyst or Yonah whose journey is one of entry into the belly of the unconscious as he didnt listen to his truth.Is it clear to the Jungian chasid only, or is it only a Hollywood trailer?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As you probably know, in 1957, after getting massive city assistance, Walter O&#039;Malley opened Dodger Stadium.

Then, he surprised everyone by blacking out the games on television.

His rationale: radio creates a desire - television satisfies it.

(I&#039;m sure there&#039;s a Torah truth buried in there.)

Appropriate to your posting, I believe.]]></description>
