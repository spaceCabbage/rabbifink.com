		<description><![CDATA[Authentic Product?&quot;&quot; What does that even mean? Matzah is no more or no less authentic than Hubba Bubba chewing gum or DiGigiorno pizza. It&#039;s not even what matzah looked like in the middle ages, when it was soft for the majority of Jews. And even if it was, so what - all bread and pita look the same. 
It&#039;s not surprising that you were unaware of the American Thinker. Left-wingers, I&#039;ve noticed, are usually (not always) ignorant of voices or opinions not in lock-step with the New York Times editorial page. You need to broaden your horizons, and hopefully (as this is an old post) by now you&#039;ve done so. For the record, the American Thinker is an online journal known for thoughtful and in-depth analysis of contemporary issues, political and social. I don&#039;t read any non-Jewish blog on a regular basis, but over the years, when I&#039;ve chanced upon or been linked to something from them, invariably its been educational.]]></description>
