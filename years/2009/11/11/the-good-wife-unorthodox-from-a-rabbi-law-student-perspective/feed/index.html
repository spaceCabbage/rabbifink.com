		<description><![CDATA[If you are a law student and think that &quot;usually the legal issues are portrayed correctly&quot; you need to study harder.  The legal issues and procedures portrayed on the show are laughable.  The show is riddled by instances where the lawyers and judges portrayed blandly say things that are absolutely contrary to established law and legal procedure.  There are so many instances of stupid legal theories and litigation based upon causes of action that don&#039;t exist that I can&#039;t even begin.  I understand that there must be some license taken to make a show fit into an hour time slot, but anybody who has been in a courtroom will tell you that lawyers do not interrupt the judge or shout each other down.  It&#039;s called contempt of court.  If the show hires attorneys as legal advisors they must hide their faces in shame every time a new episode is aired.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To my Jewish Brothers and Sisters,

In my English language sefer, Eruv Manual, which Rabbi Moshe Heinemann  edited and endorsed, I explain what to do in this situation.   The procedure is somewhat complicated but the bottom line is that someone (i.e. a member of the local committee which administers and maintains the eruv) should ask a non-Jew to repair the eruv.   A Jew in authority should  tell the non-Jew what to do and ensure that he repairs the eruv correctly.   Obviously, the Jew may not perform any melachah or handle any muktzeh during the repair job.

Reach me at    guidetobaisdin@gmail.com

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe her father was opposed to her becoming a frum Yid/ baal teshuva, and disowned her as part of the family once she became religious. Therefore, she had to make the phone call on Shabbat.

As for the supermarket, AWESOME catch. You ought to call the show and find out b/c it&#039;s really a moronic mistake.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thought exactly the same thing!  That kosher market on Sabbath thing would come up later as something suspicious.  However, I couldn&#039;t stop thinking there might be some sort of animal somewhere, just as there are strictly kosher restaurants open on the Sabbath whereby one might be able to arrange for kosher meals.  In Rochester, NY there was a restaurant open Fri. night and Saturdays considered by the local Committee to be kosher.  They were not as strict as some in other and typically larger cities, such as Cleveland.  Such bakeries were also Certified in Rochester for many years (these no longer exist).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello; apologies for coming to this blog entry so late, but, here in the UK, the episodes of this series are delayed by a few months. I enjoyed your observations, and I hope the issues raised by the plot still interest you, because I&#039;d welcome your opinion on a couple of points...

I, like Naftali, felt that the plot was a bit of a non-starter, and for the same reason. Surely an observant Jew is not only permitted, but required, to break any Shabbat law which might (if strictly observed) endanger life. Would a trailing eruv wire not be considered sufficiently hazardous to justify the act, on Shabbos, of tying it temporarily out of harm&#039;s way?

The Friday night phone call also bothered me; since the Loebs would celebrate Shabbos together, when would Anna even have the opportunity to make a phone call unobserved? unless she did so while Isaac was attending the synagogue service marking the beginning of Shabbos. (Although that, it seemed to me, would place the call too early to be referred to as Friday &quot;night&quot; by the characters who weren&#039;t observing Shabbos; I got the impression that the episode might well be placed at a time of year when it starts in the afternoon.)

I forget whether we learned enough about Isaac to be able to surmise what his schedule might be. Are there no other occasions during the week when he&#039;d routinely be out of the house? Was his ignorance of her phone calls Anna&#039;s primary consideration? Or might she believe that an act of reconciliation, such as calling her estranged father, consituted an act of piety somehow specifically appropriate to Shabbos? (Particularly in the light of his developing dementia, which she may already know about, although the audience at this point doesn&#039;t.) I wondered whether you thought there might be any Talmudic justification for such a belief...

BTW, I&#039;d assumed the portrayal of Anna the ex-party girl&#039;s revival as chasidic wife not as a suggestion that you had to be crazy to be attraced to chasidic Judaism, but as a device for pointing out Kalinda&#039;s cynicism and judgmentalism, in doubting Anna&#039;s commitment to her new life. And then deflating the cynicism with Anna&#039;s evident joy, and those subtle displays of intimacy between the Loebs (cruelly emphasised by the distress caused with the revelation of the cellphone calls). Maybe to invite us, the audience, to sympathise with Kalinda&#039;s point of view, and address those same character flaws in ourselves? I think TV writers rarely pass up an opportunity to play Aesop.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m embarrassed I didn&#039;t catch the supermarket thing.
But what bothered me the most out of what I thought to be a pretty interesting and fairly accurate episode, was, why would she choose Friday night to call her father? I could understand her need to call him, but why was it necessary to do so on Shabbos? Did I miss something? I didn&#039;t hear any explanation for why she called him then. And I *think* her husband would have been more forgiving if she had done it on another day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that the guy&#039;s haircut and beard didn&#039;t look at all Hassidic.

I didn&#039;t think that the Kosher market was a plot hole, I don&#039;t know the situation in Chicago, but in other cities (I&#039;m thinking Toronto as an example) there are large non-Jewish supermarkets in Jewish areas with big kosher sections that are open on Shabbat, I got the impression that this was the type of store she was referring to.

I also liked the way the couple didn&#039;t embrace (which was in character), the point when they discreetly touched hands was a great way to portray affection in the Hassidic community (and they contrasted it nicely with the way the lawyers touched in a similar way)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My wife saw the episode. She noticed the plot-hole herself. She told me about the episode and I said that there is a second flaw and that is:

If an eruv wire breaks on Shabbos, even though the eruv cannot be fixed on Shabbos, it is absolutely muttar to pick up the wire and wind it around something or some other similar procedure to move it out of the way l&#039;imnuyei hezeika (to prevent damages). This is the same reason one can sweep up the pieces of a broken glass on shabbos even though the pieces themselves become muktza.

Thus, unless the characters were real amei-haaratzim, if they were aware the wire broke, they would have moved it away and the story wouldn&#039;t start.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent points.

I am unfamiliar with Chicago so I figured the neighborhood was at least close to W. Rogers Park - I guess not!

The accent was awful.

I can excuse them for not knowing about a lechi. That is an more intricate detail.

Welcome, and thanks for checking out the blog!]]></description>

It was completely unnatural.

		<description><![CDATA[My wife and I caught the supermarket hole too. Other things that bothered me:
1. Why chassidim to begin with? Chassidim make up a very small part of  Chicago&#039;s frum community. Out of that percentage, many are Chabad (which this couple clearly was not) and do not use the eruv. Many of the rest are Satmar; I&#039;m not sure whether they use they eruv or not. Why not show a couple who were yeshivish or moderni, except to emphasize the otherness of shomrei shabbos?

2. Why the semi-accent on the husband? He was clearly not European or Israeli, but he spoke English with a slight hesitation, as though not fully at home in that language. Again, emphasizing the otherness?

3. The closeup of the juncture between the eruv wire and the house did not appear to have a lechi; the wire went straight into the wall, horizontally.

4. The frum nieghborhoods in Chicago -- West Rogers Park and Peterson Park -- look nothing like the NY-style row houses in the episode. You can find those row houses in older, gentrified neighborhoods of Chicago like Linclon Park, but the West Rogers Park and Peterson Park are a mix of single family houses WITH front and side yards, and two-to-four story brick apartment buildings. Were they trying to make the scene look more  like NY?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed the episode as well as your thoughts on it.

The fact that the chassidic guy doesn&#039;t smile could be because he was getting sued and upset about it then he finds out that his wife was being mechalel shabbos when calling her father. I understand your point, I&#039;m just sayin&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The eruv description was pretty good just not precise.

We have an eruv issue in Venice so I have explained it very rationally to many uniformed people. Use the explanation I gave in the post, it is very simple for a non-OJ to &#039;get&#039;.]]></description>

But then, she had already been to the grocery (she had broken bottles all around her the hatzalah guy said). I was ticked off too. Although, thought the eruv description was pretty good. When I try to explain it to non-observant people I sound like an idiot.]]></description>

His background was not significant. He may have also been a baal tshuva but he was more devout than she as he was visibly hurt by her breaking of Shabbos.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, what an analysis.  You are right on target about the ring and the hairdos and the leather yarmulke.

The phenomenon of a party girl becoming &quot;chasidic&quot; exists.  I would say, though, while the number of former party girls who became &quot;chasidic&quot; is not negligible, they would be married to other baalei tshuva, not to an FFB chasid.  Since I don&#039;t watch the show, I don&#039;t know if the husband&#039;s background was mentioned.]]></description>
