		<description><![CDATA[I worked in a grocery store (Publix) for many years and sadly, formula is always stolen. It is also an ideal cutting agent for drugs as it is harmless and already the correct consistency. It&#039;s usually not the people who need it stealing it. It&#039;s people who either use it for drugs, or resell it at a lesser price than the grocery store. The thieves work stores and patterns and generally know when it is delivered and stocked. Then they clean it out.]]></description>

In LA you need way more than the maximum WIC requirements to live.

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know personally, but isn&#039;t there WIC for formula?  I don&#039;t know if I would draw conclusions about society and poverty from the Ralph&#039;s stockperson (although I&#039;m sure he&#039;s a lovely individual).]]></description>
