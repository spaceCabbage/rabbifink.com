		<description><![CDATA[Would it surprise anybody that I did not know about this faux pas or who Lebron is?

Without heroic activity life is mundane;all media athletes or superstars are  symbols talking to our need  to participate in the herd and the heroic by identification( explaining a lot of media politics). Even acknowledging this social stir in the negative reveals our truly human needs and expectations from iconic heroes of participating in their heroism. Its only when we subsitute this symbolic participation for reality do we reconstruct idolatry as religion .]]></description>
