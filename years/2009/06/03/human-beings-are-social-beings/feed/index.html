		<description><![CDATA[I see you want to take this to the next level.

Perhaps a future post will best address these issues.

Standing on one foot, humans are morally superior purely because of our morality. Because we can choose to act outside our natural instinct we can control our animalistic tendencies. Bees cannot.

As to your second point. The shul experience has built into the experience morally good behavior, prayer, liturgy, Torah learning and studying. Thus, it is intrinsically useful for personal growth. Add to that, the social mechanism of shul and you have a double winner. Facebook, while great for the social aspect is not intrinsically good morally.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you clarified in what way we humans are morally superior to the socially networking bees in a beehive. Are we?

And what about Jewish life? What is qualitatively better about the shul experience than the Facebook experience?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tzvi: Thanks for commenting.

He is not saying that people don&#039;t like change. He is saying that political / ethical / moral change come from our social environment. So if we are socially connected to a lot of people who are gay, we will not want to withhold rights from those people. So long as gay people were small in number / in the closet etc. it was not an issue that people connected with socially.

It leaves Orthodox Judaism in the same place as everyone else. Your social environment will influence your way of thinking. Therefore, Halachic Judaism emphasizes many socially Jewish activities to maintain our social needs and remind us of our own values.

I stress this to remind folks that living a Halachic lifestyle tends to our social needs and we should use them to our advantage. For example going to Shul and having guests on Shabbos is a great way of using our social needs within a Jewish framework.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So basically people don&#039;t like change in their social lives, (or any other aspect of their lives for that matter).
In juxtaposing to Judaism - when Chazal say don&#039;t be part of a Moshev Leitzim, don&#039;t have &#039;evil&#039; friends, etc. I take that to mean that yes, we know that socialization is an important part of human nature, and that should be utilized. We don&#039;t go for seclusion and such, but make sure you do it right. If you can&#039;t, go to the Maimonidean desert, and separate yourself from society.
So where does that leave us as Orthodox Jews in a very multicolored society?]]></description>
