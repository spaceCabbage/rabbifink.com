		<description><![CDATA[Great post. Back in the day, when I had disposable income (ie. before I had kids) I used to buy a lot of books. Now I take books out from the library, where I can reserve books online, get an email notification when my book is ready, pick up my book, and self check-out, so the whole transaction takes less than 5 minutes. The cost of books is one reason I have never gotten an ereader, another is shabbos. Lately, I have started printing out divrei Torah and longer articles that I don&#039;t have time to read during the week, to read on shabbat. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are plenty of books that I purchase, just not 30-40 of them a week :)

We probably own a few thousand books right now. Mostly paperbacks. I own many books by my favorite authors, for example I own at least 100 books by Isaac Asimov, at least 50 by Robert Heinlein, all the Kellerman (husband, wife, and now son) books, and plenty of others. We recently purchased a few hundred &quot;Baby Sitters Club&quot; (and spinoffs) and &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; books for the kids. And of course there&#039;s the ubiquitous Scholastic book order forms that show up with the kids schoolwork every few weeks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m also a &quot;cheap Jew&quot; that uses the library and doesn&#039;t own an e-reader (other than a few iPod Touch devices, an iPhone 3G, and an iPhone 4). I like the library because it has a much wider variety of books than I can acquire on my own. It also gets the latest books in a timely fashion. Additionally, I can read a few pages of the book before I decide if I want it or not. It has lots of advantages for me, my wife, both voracious readers, and my kids some of which are voracious readers. Maybe &quot;cheap&quot; has something to do with it, because between all of us, we often go through 30 or 40 books a week! The cost of that would be rather prohibitive for us.

Maybe someday there will be an e-reader that can access books from the library, or at least access all books previously purchased/read.

Not to mention that a stand-alone e-reader doesn&#039;t really make sense for me. Who wants to carry yet another device around while so many other devices we already carry have screens and memory?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is unrelated to ebooks and Judaism, but... buying books is important because it supports authors.  If we all stopped buying our books, and just used the library, think how many authors would have to stop writing.  I buy my books because I feel that, with every purchase, I&#039;m supporting the future of literature.  Authors don&#039;t earn a lot of money, so I&#039;m proud to support them when I can.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for commenting.

I am an avid reader, as is my wife. We get our books from the library. I am not &quot;being cheap&quot;. I am just saying that if I don&#039;t buy old fashioned books, why would I BUY e-books!?

I know there are classics available for free. And I know there are some more affordable books as well. But for the best sellers and more popular books, (ie the books we, and most other people read) the cost is almost always $10.

I have done my research. As my readers know, I am a huge technophile. I simply don&#039;t find the lure of an e-reader irresistible, at all...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding the page turn option, I am sure someone will come up with a variety of times on it.  That way,  during the week you can experiment with how long it takes you to read a standard page and then set the timer for slightly longer.  Of course, I find that to be an honoring of the letter rather than the spirit of the law and would not have done it when I was keeping Shabbos.  As for book prices,  I find your comment about not paying 10 dollars for a book a bit offensive and playing right in  the stereotype of the &quot;cheap Jew&quot;.  Also, your data is incorrect.  A large number of books for e-readers are available for less than 10 dollars (ranging in price from 99 cents to $9.99), so you can easily obtain low price books, and almost all &quot;classics&quot; are available free.  So, while I think e-readers and other electronic devices should be turned off  for Shabbos, don&#039;t knock e-readers in general without doing more research, please.]]></description>

How will the proliferation of e-readers affect the print publishing industry, and by extension the library going population as well....?

		<description><![CDATA[1) Articles about Orthodox Jews often misrepresent us or get us wrong.  I recall a &quot;mainstream&quot; Jewish magazine publishing a cover with a woman in tallis and tefillin under the headline &quot;The Future of Orthodox Judaism?&quot;  The article itself actually had nothing to do with Orthodoxy but implied that as Reform and Conservatism became completely egalitarian, the Orthodox would be under increased pressure to conform and thus egalitarianism was inevitable for us too.  So much for that theory.
2) You don&#039;t need an e-reader.  Sorry, you simply don&#039;t.  Once upon a time if I wanted to look up a reference I had to pull another book off the shelf.  I still do that.  It isn&#039;t that hard.  E-readers are very convenient but they are not necessary, especially 1 day out of 7.
3) A halachic analysis of how they work and how much of what they do is only prohibited rabbinically is fascinating.  unfortunately such an analysis only applies if lives are at stake, not for comfort reading.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As someone who came to Orthodox Judaism via the Reform movement, I am sad to admit that the impression that Orthodox Judaism only cares &quot;about the letter of the law&quot; is still very widespread. In fact, that was something that kept me away from Orthodoxy for a few years. It wasn&#039;t until I got to actually meet Orthodox Jews who, B&quot;H, showed me how a beautiful a Torah observant life is, that I could begin to feel differently.

I have an iPad; and I think it&#039;s very cool. But then again, I&#039;m a big gadget person anyway. But even though I love my gadgets (and computers, and stereo...TV I can pass on though), I do appreciate leaving them all alone on Shabbos. Shabbos is a time to get back to our roots so to speak. To not lose sight of the fact that everything comes from Hashem. Is reading a book on an e-reader more important than that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;However, if electricity becomes so ubiquitous that in order to avoid it on Shabbos, orthodox Jews would need to live like the Amish, it is possible that the halachic authorities will reconsider the original decision to consider use of electricity a violation of Shabbos. At that point anything is possible.&lt;/i&gt;

I think the main thing that will cause the laws of Shabbat to begin to change will be what&#039;s called &quot;The Smart House&quot;. Pretty soon, maybe 50 or 100 years from now, all homes will be &quot;smart&quot;. They will adjust lighting, temperature, and perhaps other things automatically based on presence. They will not have traditional locks and keys but rather will know that it is you and will lock/unlock as necessary. And there will be plenty of other differences that none of us can even conceive of today.

&lt;i&gt;the Shabbos e-reader would turn pages at regular intervals&lt;/i&gt;

I agree that this is entirely ridiculous and unworkable. But there are other workarounds that would work perfectly well. Not only that, but they won&#039;t be workarounds, they will be standard operation of e-readers in a few generations. I am referring to tracking the eyes that are doing the reading and turning the page when appropriate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not for beginners like me! I couldn&#039;t even imagine what to print in advance because I &quot;click through&quot; so many things while learning. For example the daf today (http://tinyurl.com/25s994u), when I want to see a pasuk mentioned, I just click on it and boom there it is (http://tinyurl.com/266npdc) and it even tells me everywhere else the pasuk is mentioned. And if I want to see, let&#039;s say, Rashi on that pasuk, I just open another tab with chumash and Rashi. And so on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I actually posed this very question to my rabbi.  Can I read with my kindle on Shabbat?  And the answer was a flat no.  He said if he couldn&#039;t use his iPad, I most certainly could not use my kindle.  He told me to suck it up and find Shabbat books with pages.  REAL pages.  Now actually I do love my kindle...I get a LOT of free or less than retail books on it.  If it&#039;s more than $10 and the real book is $.01 guess which one I get?  (Okay I have a book thing, I admit it.)  But I also love to sleep.  So what do I do on Shabbat?  I sleep.  I play scrabble with my family (and kick their butts!)  I would consider myself a Conservative leaning into the Orthodox wind...and my rabbi?  He&#039;s extremely traditional but avoids labelling.  In any event...he said no, I promised to abide by his rule when I asked questions of him and so, no e books until after Shabbat is over.]]></description>
