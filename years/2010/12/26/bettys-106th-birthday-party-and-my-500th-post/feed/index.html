		<description><![CDATA[Amazing! I think her lack of permanent companionship may have contributed to her longevity. Many people who lose loved ones feel they have nothing to live for and wilt away. Perhaps part of her secret is that she had no reason to leave us. May she be zocheh to see another 106 years!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice! Mazal Tov to her.

&lt;i&gt;She has lived a very happy and fulfilling life despite, for the most part, lack of companionship.&lt;/i&gt;

Do you know for sure that she lacks (or lacked*) companionship, maybe she had lots of friends? Or do you simply mean &quot;lack of husband and family&quot;?

* &quot;lacked&quot; because in many cases, when people become very elderly their friends/companions and acquaintances all have died and they don&#039;t make new ones.]]></description>
