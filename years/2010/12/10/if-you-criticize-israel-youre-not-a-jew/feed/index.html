		<description><![CDATA[What of sects such as Satmar who are halachikly opposed to Zionism?  Are they also &quot;not Jews&quot;?  I&#039;m not counting Neturei Karta, they are a fringe group who have completely been disowned by mainstream Satmar (and the Chassidim I&#039;ve spoken to of various sects)!  But there is a sizeable faction of Jews who simply oppose the State of Israel, and even believe that it is assur to have a secular government there...or to have a Jewish ruling class until Moshiach comes (and/or Nevu&#039;ah is restored).  What of them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few Neturei Karta types beat up a Jew.  That&#039;s the exception, not the rule.  From your reporting of Cohen&#039;s article, he doesn&#039;t point that out.

I don&#039;t use the phrase &quot;not a Jew&quot; lightly.  That&#039;s a halachic distinction, not a political one.

What is important to point out, to Jew and Gentile alike, is that forming an opinion on Israel based solely on the nightly news can be very dangerous.  If you don&#039;t live here in Israel, don&#039;t assume that you know the best course of action for us.

It reminds me of a funny story from this past summer.  There was a discussion at the dining room table of friends of mine in Maale Adumim, a large suburbia, population 30,000 - about seven minutes drive from Jerusalem.  A young liberal Jew sat at his hosts&#039; table, conversing about &quot;the matsav&quot; (the situation).  He adamantly declared that &quot;the settlements&quot; are illegal, immoral, and that he would never set foot in such a place.

His hosts, trying to stifle their own laughter, calmly pointed out that he was sitting in a so-called &quot;settlement&quot; right now.

He young man was baffled.  &quot;What?!  This can&#039;t be a settlement!&quot;

This college graduate had been educated by CNN on &quot;settlements&quot;.  He *knew* that a settlement was five trailers in the middle of 100,000 Arabs.  If only Israel would get rid of the &quot;settlements&quot;, the Arabs wouldn&#039;t bother them anymore.

It&#039;s pointless to call someone more or less of a Jew - that definition is binary.  Still, criticism from outside of the Holy Land too often comes from people who do not have all of the facts.  If they would live here and see the truth with their own eyes, they may feel differently.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is that most of these liberal Jews sound like al jazeera! Israel has been and most likely will be in some state of war with its immediate neighbors for a very very long time! During this war time, it weakens Israel in the eyes of its enemies when most Jews are sounding exactly like those israel is trying to defeat! there is no room for moral equivalency right now! When physical survival and the survival of the state is at stake we cant be politically correct and cry for the arabs who shouldnt buy houses in Israel or when Israel expends its ultimate force in defending itself. At the end of the day we MUST believe we are right and the land belongs to us and we must do what we can (within SOME parameters) to keep it that way.]]></description>
