		<description><![CDATA[Since the vast majority of American Jews are Ashkenazi, you will always hear Ashkenazi voices more than Sephardi.
There is not much of a Sephardic community to be biased against in the U.S., although in Israel that&#039;s not the case.
The term &quot;anti-semitism&quot; didn&#039;t exist in the 15th century, so why be surprised that it was&#039;t used?  Sephardim knew anti-Jewish behavior when they saw it.

This entire post is just silly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Facts:

There is an anti-Sephardic bias.

There is a tendency to cry anti-Semitism when it is not warranted.

Historically, Sephardic Jews do not claim anti-Semitism.

Opinion:

It fits in neatly with Dwek / Rubashkin.

Conclusion:

Whether you agree with the application to these 2 crooks or not, the facts still speak loudly enough to give you pause and make you think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You might be right. In fact your possibility is what 99/100 frum Jews would say.

That doesn&#039;t make it true.

I only wish to provide alternative ways of approaching communal problems so that we, as a group, continue to think about issues instead of sweeping them all under a very large (and bulging) carpet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll give you possible.
Just to throw a few more facts into the mix, there are a lot of cases involving ashkenazim where anti-semitism was not (popularly) claimed. One example would be the Spinka tax fraud/money laundering case. There are many more. I think the more likely explanation for the disparate (popular) frum responses to the Rubashkin and Dwek cases are that many people, including many non-jews, believe that Runashkin got a raw deal (which some people, correctly or not, attribute to bias), and the fact that Dwek, who was offered a plea deal in exchange for his participation in other investigations as a cooperating witness, does not exactly cut a sympathetic character in the frum community.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No it&#039;s not like that at all.

This blog post was an observation of a few facts that led me to a possible / likely / probably theory. It is not scientific. There is no proof. It&#039;s an opinion based on my observations.

Can I be wrong? Certainly.

Is the premise worth considering even if it&#039;s not a controlled experiment meeting the rigorous standards of science? In my opinion, certainly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So your argument is that Ashkenazi Jews have a anti-semitism reflex, while Sephardim do not. You support that argument by contrasting the reactions of the two groups to two separate cases, without demonstrating that the two cases are similiar.

That is like a Dr. that has two patients. He strikes one patient in patellar tendon with a tendon hammer (thx Wikipedia), to which the patient responds with a &quot;knee-jerk reaction.&quot; He taps the second patient on the head, producing no &quot;knee-jerk reaction.&quot; Per your logic, the Dr. would be able to say, &quot;clearly patient #1 is predisposed to &quot;knee-jerk reactions,&quot; while patient #2 is not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of possible explanations:

1.  Given that Ashkenazim were more affected by the Shoah, it might make sense that they would be more willing to &quot;act out&quot; in wacky ways.

2.  Because Ashkenazim are more likely to be haredim, they are more likely to be part of an isolated subculture in which it is more encouraged to &quot;act out&quot; in wacky ways.

3.  The 15th century isn&#039;t quite relevant to our situation, because there wasn&#039;t mass media (e.g. the internet) to spread wacky ideas.

4.  (admittedly inconsistent with 3)  Who needs paranoia about anti-Semitism when you have false messiahs?  (See, e.g., Sabbatai Zevi, Jacob Frank)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In order for your comparison beween the Rubashkin and Dwek cases to be valid and supportable, you would have to compare the factors from the Rubashkin case that are commonly inerpreted by some as anti-semitic, and demonstrate how these factors were equally present in the Dwek, case, and are not interpreted as anti-semitic. Without doing an exhaustive comparison, I imagine a lot of those factors are inaplicable to the Dwek case, b/c of the fact that he pled quilty and cooperated in the investigations, and agreed to act as a cooperating witness in other invetigations. Basically - apples and oranges.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course the cases are not identical. They share 2 very important common denominators: bank fraud and federal investigations.

Dwek pled guilty. Rubashkin pled not-guilty. However, according to the evidence they were equally guilty.

Rubashkin got caught after a Federal raid on his plant looking for illegal workers, Dwek got caught after he wrote a bad check.

Is there a significant difference here that warrants anti-Semitic cries in one case and complicit satisfaction in the other?]]></description>
