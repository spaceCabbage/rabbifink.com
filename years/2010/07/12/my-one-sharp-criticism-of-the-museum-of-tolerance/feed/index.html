		<description><![CDATA[There is no correct answer to your question. The problem lies in the inherent internal inconsistency of the word &quot;tolerance&quot;. The implication is that &#039;tolerance&quot; is a positive virtue and its opposite is a negative. If you have an exhibit of Israel doing something intolerant (the wall) but is humane, good, and peace-promoting, then you&#039;re in effect cross-wiring the terminology. Like &quot;terrorism&quot;, &quot;intolerance&quot; is a strategy. What we need to promote are those people and movements that are aligned with Western values. As Barry Goldwater said, channeling Cicero, extremism in the defence of personal liberty is no vice, and moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you make a valid point.

Just one related (or not so related) question. Does the museum deal with in any way some of the cases which could be seen as &#039;religious intolerance&#039; such as Gay rights?]]></description>
