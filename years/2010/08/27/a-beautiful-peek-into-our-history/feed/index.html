		<description><![CDATA[Thanks.
&lt;em&gt;&quot;Some of my great-grandparents were in “White Russia” in 1910. They may have known these boys, they may even be one of these boys.&quot;

I strongly doubt it. White Russia (aka present day Belarus) is very far from Uzbekistan.&lt;/em&gt;

Of course. It was not for historical fact rather historical context. Call it poetic license.]]></description>
