		<description><![CDATA[Are you saying that Imam Rauf is a moderate?  The same man who presented his book &quot;What&#039;s Right about Islam&quot; (I need to double check the title)  at the Kuala Lumpur Hizb ut Tahrir gathering a year or two ago?  Hizb ut Tahrir is an organization that believes all the world&#039;s Muslims should be ruled by a caliph wherever they may live.  They also call for the dismantling of Israel, have not denounced terrorist groups such as Hamas, and want to do away with America and the west&#039;s &quot;colonial policies.&quot;  Imam Rauf is no moderate.  He may present himself as one, but he is not -- and we all know his infamous line after 9/11 about the US being at least partly at fault for the Twin Towers&#039; destruction.  It is scary to me that intelligent people are fooled by him and others like him.  The stakes are simply too high to take chances.  Of course the real problem is not this &quot;cultural center&quot; -- it is the proliferation of practitioners of the most repressive religion on earth all over this country, not merely near Ground Zero.  This will come back to haunt us.  Let&#039;s not forget what we would not be allowed to build in their countries.  Why don&#039;t they show some inter-cultural understanding?  Why must we continue to kowtow to them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How sad it is that so many &quot;replies&quot; to Rabbi Fink&#039;s reasoned post either did not read it or do not want to know that 1)this is a cultural center with a planned prayer area and it is NOT at Ground Zero but 2 1/2 blocks away.

My father would say to them: &quot;Dont&#039; be an anti-semit!!&quot; this was his shorthand for any bigot.

And isn&#039;t it ironic that when many Jewish &quot;voices&quot; have called for moderate Muslims to speak up, when one with proven credentials does, then he is lumped with the most radical Muslims. As if all Jewish settlers were responsible for Barukh Goldstein or the assassin of Itzhak Rabin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The primary obstacle in Liberal thought  is a narcissistic view of the universe-viewing others not thru a window, but rather a mirror, musing how everyone is well- meaning, kind and moral just like we are. It&#039;s sweet but extremely dangerous if not absurdly inane . Cordoba is part of a historical pattern of Muslim conquest of infidels. Building Mosques upon churches as in Cordoba Spain or the Al Aqsaa in Jerusalem atop the temple Mount  is not an aberration but consistent unapologetic Muslim behavior;. a study of Islam and the Koran is a must for anyone attempting to second guess Muslim intentions. Ignoring Israel&#039;s nightmarish 60- year year history under Muslim Apartheid is simply incomprehensible and self delusional. The Torah in particular is not wishy washy in calling a spade a spade; evil is clearly delineated as well as good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Leslie, I agree with you. We, as Jews, have always been an open minded, rational, justice oriented culture. Not perfect in the least; these are just part of our cultural heritage. But to be completely open to this Islamic Center would be naive, given the recent activities in America, including the discovery of anti American terrorists living in suburbia. How many violent incidents are to be tolerated here or abroad? There comes a time when one must say &quot;Enough-no more Mr. Nice Guy attitudes&quot;. We are better off to follow the model of the Western Cowboy-a more protective, more discriminating, tough-guy point of view-at least until recognizable safety and security have been established. The Palestinian population for example wants to give its people the &quot;right of return&quot; and allow Palestinians from all over the world to live in Israel under the auspices of a 2 state solution. But if that were to happen, Zionism, or the return of Jews to their homeland,Israel, would be outnumbered and quite possibly, destroyed. Muslim activists have ALWAYS had an ulterior motive towards democratic values, specifically Jewish ones, so why are we allowing ourselves to be hoodwinked? Take note that in the Koran, Muslims are instructed to destroy Jews. Now, obviously not everyone is a fundamentalist terrorist, but the directives go so far back, that these ideas are part and parcel of the Islamic heritage . I&#039;m not saying anything new-we all know this-I&#039;m just reminding you to REMEMBER!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[E Fink - &lt;i&gt;From their website:&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;m not sure if their website is a good source for this argument. After all, the Hamas website says good things about Hamas.The US government website says good things about the US. Etc.

I don&#039;t think Americans are the big issue here, most Americans don&#039;t really care about the mosque; They do care about getting good jobs and making a living. I think the bigger issue is that this mosque will be (and already is) &lt;i&gt;portrayed&lt;/i&gt; as having been built &quot;at&quot; ground zero which will be perceived by many Muslims (and others) worldwide as &quot;building the victory mosque at the location of the victory&quot;, just like a mosque has been built at the site of almost every other great victory throughout history. This doesn&#039;t mean that all Muslims are anti-USA or pro-terror, just like many Muslims around the world celebrating joyously during 9/11/2001 didn&#039;t mean it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The best analogy that I have seen is that of a hypothetical German cultural center at Auschwitz, which celebrates the German people, history, and culture, and attempts to promote understanding between German and other cultures. Is there a place in this world for such a center? Yes, I think there is. Would Auschwitz, which has become a symbol to the world of the Holocaust, a period in which the German people and their allies murdered millions of people, in part under the banner of the superiority of the German people, be an appropriate location for such a center? No, I think it would be an affront to the memory of the millions that Auschwitz is intended to memorialize. Does that make me anti-German?]]></description>

Is there a place in this world for such a center? Yes, I think there is. Would Auschwitz, which has become a symbol to the world of the Holocaust, a period in which the German people and their allies murdered millions of people, in part under the banner of the superiority of the German people, be an appropriate location for such a center? No, I think it would be an affront to the memory of the millions that Auschwitz is intended to memorialize. Does that make me anti-German?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[One need only to look at what is happening in much of Europe where Muslims have become part of the fabric of free societies.  Actually, they don&#039;t become part of the fabric; it is more like another piece of cloth.  There is no society that has improved due to their presence, quite the opposite.  It is dangerous to believe this &quot;cultural center&quot; is what it is purported to be.  Mosque/cultural center/whatever -- they are more quietly being built all over this country, not just near Ground Zero.  Perhaps there is good reason for &quot;Islamophobia.&quot;  Which of their countries would you want to live in?  Be able to live in?  It is a known fact that the &quot;truth&quot; espoused by many Muslims is anything but.  This &quot;cultural center&quot; will be a breeding ground for radical elements, of which there are many.  It&#039;s just a matter of time.  Of course it sounds so open-minded and reasonable to want people of all religions to be able to express their beliefs freely and equally -- but this isn&#039;t just another religion, and they do not live in harmony with anyone else once their numbers grow.  Their use of American freedoms will ultimately make us less free.  We already are.  Why do you think there are security measures everywhere?  Airports, office buildings, schools, concerts, etc.?  There was a time this was unheard of.  It&#039;s because of practitioners of the so-called religion of peace.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It remains to be seen what it will be and how it will be used. Ideally, it will show that there is a real version of Islam that is not what the world now thinks Islam is all about.

If there is a mechanism in place make sure it is not used to recruit/spread fundamentalism, it could be a great thing. If not, it could be the beginning of the Islamification of America.]]></description>
