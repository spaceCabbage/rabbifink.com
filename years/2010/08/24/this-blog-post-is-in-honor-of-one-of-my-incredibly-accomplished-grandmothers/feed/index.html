		<description><![CDATA[Wow. Eliyahu you make me sound wonderful. My husband and mother would have believed it all--me-- my greatest accomplishment is wonderful children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. As always I am so proud of you and your delightful family. (and your ability to do so much each and every day)  Thank you for the kind words.  It meant so much to me that you were able to come.]]></description>
