		<description><![CDATA[This author thinks we are stupid.  Ok, many really are.  But how can you compare truly racist comments of Helen Thomas, to Dr. Laura who was trying to make a point and might be guilty of momentarily being insensitive.  Seems like we have a very amateur writer who has little education or the writer is super sympathetic to the &quot;Palestinians&quot; and cares nothing about Israelis or Jews.  Another one sided liberal hack wanna bee.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; Fink - &lt;i&gt;I don’t think Thomas or Schlessinger went past those limits.

If someone had said one of your two examples do you think they should be fired? Sure, they are bigoted jerks, but why fire them?&lt;/i&gt;

It&#039;s very simple and I&#039;ll use an example. If a Toyota executive makes a stupid mistake that damages a production run of 100,000 vehicles, he will be fired. Same here. These &lt;i&gt;employees&lt;/i&gt; made a stupid mistake that damaged their employers business and they were fired. End of story.

It may be that if you were their boss, you would give them another chance, but who knows? If your job as boss (or your performance bonus, or whatever) depended on the good behavior of your employees, perhaps you also wouldn&#039;t give them another chance.

That&#039;s what is known as life in the real world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So where would you draw the line?

Imagine Thomas had said: &quot;Jews should “get the hell out of America&quot; and &quot;go home...to Poland, Germany..&quot; Would that exceed your limits? Change America to Palestine, and that is what she said.

Should someone be fired for making bigoted statements? Sometimes, yes. Like I have said before, words matter, especially the words of public figures, and even more so the words of members of the media. Such people, with their words, have the power to make an impact on society, and therefore, a special duty to watch what they say. If someone abuses this power, than I think it reasonable to consider suspending it or completely taking it away. That is what happened to Don Imus (temporarilly), that is what happened to Helen Thomas, and that is what is happening to Mel Gibson.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dr. Laura acted like a fool and was forced to face the consequences. I am not convinced that she was fired because my understanding is that she will be on the air until the end of the year. The NY Times is reporting that she &lt;i&gt;said on Tuesday night that she would not renew her contract for the show when it expires at the end of the year.

On CNN’s “Larry King Live,” Dr. Schlessinger said that she would leave her “Dr. Laura Program” because she doesn’t want to have to prune her words or opinions.

“I want to be able to say what’s on my mind and in my heart and what I think is helpful and useful without somebody getting angry, some special interest group deciding this is the time to silence a voice of dissent and attack affiliates, attack sponsors,” she said. “I’m sort of done with that.”&lt;/i&gt;

That is a childish response on her part. She is acting petulant because the marketplace just smacked her. That same marketplace of ideas says that you can&#039;t speak this way without consequences.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t think either should lose their jobs. But I don&#039;t think they can be compared. Thomas, was actually giving HER OWN opinion on the matter. She really felt that way.

Dr. Laura was simply repeating something that goes on television. She didn&#039;t say it out of her own convictions.

Hence, i agree, these people so much a lot of the times and a slip up is unavoidable. Problem here is, I don&#039;t even see Dr. Laura as even slipping up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rush Limbaugh has been saying politically incorrect things for over twenty years; even longer as a local radio host.  (not the least of which being the highly insensitive term &quot;feminazi&quot;)

He&#039;s still around.  Why?  Because people want to listen to what he&#039;s saying.  I even think he&#039;d survive an utterance of the dreaded N word.  He&#039;s just that popular.

I agree with you that people shouldn&#039;t rise up from the streets and scream in protest over every single politically incorrect statement made in broadcast media.

<p>He&#8217;s still around.  Why?  Because people want to listen to what he&#8217;s saying.  I even think he&#8217;d survive an utterance of the dreaded N word.  He&#8217;s just that popular.</p>
<p>I agree with you that people shouldn&#8217;t rise up from the streets and scream in protest over every single politically incorrect statement made in broadcast media.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I don&#8217;t think that any company ought to sacrifice its own profitability for some ignoble principle of allowing an unpopular broadcaster to stay on the air, in the name of &#8220;free speech&#8221;.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Again - no one has deprived either of these women of their free speech rights.  I know that you understand the difference between government censorship and a business decision, so why are you trying to blur the distinction here?

Like Aliza said, Don Imus rebounded from his gaffe and returned to the airwaves - precisely because there is an audience that wants to listen to him on the radio.

Especially with the state of technology today, when any one of us can have a blog, a podcast, or a live streaming internet radio station, I don&#039;t see how either of these cases has anything to do with curtailing free speech.

If the government was going to start automatically banning hateful words, it would overreact and install an automatic script to edit anything that looks like said word.  Example:  &quot;Niamey is the capital of the West African nation of *****&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Helen Thomas was judged by her reporting. If this had been a lone incident capping a long career or objective reporting, it would have played out differently. The fact is that her reporting has never been objective, and this incident was merely a manifestation of the bias that can be found in her years of &quot;reporting.&quot; Also, Helen never really repudiated what her initial statement suggested, that Israel has no right to exist. Basically, her &quot;apology&quot; was really a non-apology. That is why she can&#039;t take back her words - b/c she never really attempted to. As an aside, I see a certain poetic justice in the woman, who made a career of jumping down the throats of others in front of cameras and microphones, finally being undone and having her legacy tarnished by a camera and a microphone during an unguarded moment. She lived by the sword, and she died by it.
Dr. Laura, whom I am not especially fond of, used a word in a context and manner that would have been perfectly acceptable to most, were her skin a different color. I see a difference there.]]></description>

But for sure, it&#039;s hard when words are your livelihood not to slip up. I don&#039;t imagine that these ladies have permanently stepped down. If Don Imus made it back on air, I&#039;m sure these ladies will be back when the air has cleared.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read all the comments so perhaps someone has already written this, but to compare a journalist  -- Helen Thomas -- whose very profession demands objectivity, to a radio talk show personality -- Dr. Laura -- whose whole show is about her own personal opinions, misses the point.  It was certainly a terrible idea for Dr. Laura to spew the N word even though she was not using it as an epithet.  What spewed out of Thomas&#039; mouth was hate and blatant anti-Semitism, rendering any article she would ever write, past and future, not compliant with accepted standards of journalism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why bring up the 1st amendment?  Neither Schlessinger nor Thomas were prosecuted by any federal or state authority for their speech.

This is simply a matter of capitalism.  Clear Channel Radio and Hearst Publications, respectively, have a right to stop employing people who are more liability than asset to the company.  Indeed, it is more than a right; the managers of these and all corporations have a duty to the shareholders to make these kinds of decisions.

If Laura wants to start her own radio program, using her own radio frequency and/or her own Internet Server, she can say anything she wants all day and night.

If Helen wants to run her own newspaper and/or website, she can also write or say anything she wants.

This is not a 1st amendment issue at all.  This is pure capitalism.  The fact that capitalism happened to wash away an apostate and an antisemite, in these cases, is just the cherry on top.  :o)]]></description>

But there are other ways for them to suffer the consequences. There are social implications (ie people will respect them less), there are financial implications (ie losing sponsors) but the finality of losing their voice completely is too steep a price in my opinion.

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t say that I agree. When you make a living off of media and communicating, you must be aware of cultural sensitivities, communal respect, and the like. Freedom of speech is one thing; but if you wish to earn a living from speaking to a wide group of people, you have a higher standard to adhere to. Just like bus drivers and truck drivers have a higher standard to adhere to than your regular car driver.

Dr. Laura could have made her point in a MUCH better way. I listened to the broadcast several times, and it was absolutely dripping with her own personal angst and frustration. It had little to do with counseling the caller. On top of that, I could practically feel the embarrassment of the caller...the way that Dr. Laura kept interrupting her and nit-picking over her personal choices. There is a reason why Judaism teaches us that embarrassment is akin to murder. It kills the spirit of another...and just like murder, it is very painful to witness.

No Dr. Laura and Helen Thomas need to internalize the fact that there are consequences to the things you say. Yes, exercise your freedom of speech...and be prepared to fully accept any fallout that may come from it!]]></description>
