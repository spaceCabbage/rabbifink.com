		<description><![CDATA[&#062;If your content is good, people will read it or watch or discuss it.

I think if your content is crap, people will also read, watch discuss and actually believe it. I think web 2.0 is great. But I also wander what if any, or its drawbacks. Problem I see, and perhaps its not so much a problem with web 2.0 , as much as its a problem with the digital age, is that non-issues are issues. The private sphere of man and the mistakes that a man partakes in his private sphere are now in the public sphere for others to judge. Information is taken out of context and misused. Good research is sacrificed for expediency. The right to someone&#039;s opinion is really taken advantage of to the point that stupid opinions are literally everywhere and people reading take it as fact.

Oh well.]]></description>
