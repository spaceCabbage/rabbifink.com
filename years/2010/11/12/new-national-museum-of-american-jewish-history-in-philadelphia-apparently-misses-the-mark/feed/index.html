		<description><![CDATA[The trayfe banquet deserves to be well remembered, as it contributed to a Jewish schism (the one which formed Conservative Judaism). I doubt that Reform Judaism would disappear, though: a watered-down or &quot;different&quot; form of Judaism will always appeal to someone, and I suspect that the children of intermarriages and people dissatisfied with Christianity might be interested in Reform (as well as people dissatisfied with Orthodox Judaism). With the high Orthodox birthrate, there is probably bound to be numerous rebels out there; of course Reform might pick those people up as well. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OMG!!!  There really was a rabbinical banquet serving forbidden foods on purpose???  I don&#039;t care what people do privately -- we are all human and have our foibles -- but to celebrate that which the Torah forbids and still call oneself a rabbi???  It boggles the mind.  As for this museum&#039;s emphasis on non-religious Jews, it does make sense: given their birthrate compared to the fruitful Orthodox birthrate, plus their dwindling numbers thanks to mixed marriage and apathy among their ranks, it really will be necessary at some point in the perhaps not-too-distant future to have a museum to remember them by.]]></description>
