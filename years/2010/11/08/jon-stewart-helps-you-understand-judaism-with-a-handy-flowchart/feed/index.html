		<description><![CDATA[Remind me later, he did a similar segment in his first book, &quot;Naked Pictures of Famous People&quot;.  I will search for my copy of it and send you this one.

The only one I remember off the top of my head is that one of the categories was &quot;Funniest Comedian&quot;.  Orthodox: Jackie Mason.  Conservative: Woody Allen.  Reform:  Carrot Top. (Irony: I&#039;m told that Jackie Mason actually is an ordained Conserv. rabbi).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As far as I understand, &quot;going egal&quot; in Conservative synagogues means that women become eligible to perform all the ritual tasks (aliyot, leading tefillot, leining the Torah, etc).

I wonder if there are any Conservative synagogues that have a female Rabbi yet aren&#039;t egalitarian (by this definition)?  [probably not]

&lt;i&gt;Our rabbi is retiring, I doubt the congregation would accept a female rabbi.&lt;/i&gt;

I wonder why not? Is it because of Jewish tradition or because they (and when I say &quot;they&quot;, obviously I mean the majority of the congregation, there are usually great differences of opinion on the &quot;egal&quot; issue in Conservative synagogues) feel more comfortable with a man?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Conservative ... Wait, they also have women beneath men? Really?&lt;/i&gt;

Yes, while many Conservative congregations permit women equal standing, not all of them have &quot;gone egal&quot; (as my father-in-law put it when his synagogue did it).]]></description>
