		<description><![CDATA[I am an orthodox Jew.  I have been-from birth.  I  think that the orthodox Jewish community has an issue at hand.  What makes it worse, is the Hush that goes around.  And around.  So many-too many-times, the rabbis will want to police the issue.  Not deal with it first, but be the only ones to deal with it.  They want to be the decision maker on who, what, when, where, why, how goes to the governmental authorities.  I know first hand of the unwillingness of the orthodox Jewish clergy not wanting to deal with it head on, hesitating on setting up a &quot;special beis din&quot; and eventually allowing the appropriate authorities to be contacted.  Now, the offender is not seen publicly, after too too many years of sexually offending people.  Friends, relatives and other non-victims don&#039;t believe it initially, but this must be spoken about.  This must be spoken about.  I&#039;ve heard too many stories.  It&#039;s sad that this behavior is normal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hush is a VERY good read, but I disagree that it&#039;s for adults only.  It&#039;s absolutely a book for teens.  As in Laurie Halse Anderson&#039;s SPEAK, too many teens will see themselves in the pages, but it helps them to know 1) they&#039;re not alone and 2) there&#039;s nothing wrong with them but with their abusers.  ]]></description>
