		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Intolerable? Really? That’s a pretty poor word choice for “systematic extermination of all Jews in Germany”. I have no problem with current Germans or Germany or German products. I do have a problem with whitewashing the Holocaust and calling it “intolerable”.&lt;/i&gt;

Another little known interesting fact is that Nazis and supporters of Nazis didn&#039;t have any children. I&#039;ve been to Germany many times in my life, and conversed with many Germans, and not one of them had parents that were Nazis or Nazi supporters. I know this for a fact because they make sure to let me know about it one way or another. Based on this random sampling, I can only conclude that Nazis had no children!]]></description>
