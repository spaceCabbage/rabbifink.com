		<description><![CDATA[Thanks. Now go write to your legislature. Florida is one of the most egregious FM states...

1) I cited a study (very extensive and academic) that shows that crime levels are completely unaffected by felony murder doctrines. So it would stand to reason that NOT having FM in the DA&#039;s arsenal of tools cannot have a &quot;good justice&quot; result in jurisdictions of non-FM. I think that answers part of your question. As to the other part - of course there is bad justice in non-FM jurisdictions as well. But not because of their non-FM rules - I dont think.

2) First, they have committed a felony. So punish them for the felony they committed, just not murder. Second, they can be aiders and abettors (accomplices) or members of a conspiracy.

3) There are other ways of slapping an indirect participant with murder. I am not in favor of any of them. But I am LEAST in favor of FM for the reasons mentioned in the article.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read the entire article. It&#039;s good and I&#039;m pretty much convinced by it. And convincing me is not an easy feat :-)

But I have a few questions:

1) You cited clear, and even extreme, examples of injustice. But are there also examples of good justice, and/or counterexamples of bad justice in places where felony murder doesn&#039;t exist?
2) What crime should such people be charged with instead? Accomplice to murder (is there such a thing?) perhaps? Something else?
3) Do you think that in certain egregious cases, the DA should retain the option to charge such a person with some sort of murder count?]]></description>
