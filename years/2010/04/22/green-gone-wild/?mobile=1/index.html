I am really appreciative to MSNBC.com for the great publicity they gave our Shul with the Escape Into America photo-film as I mentioned here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/19/pacific-jewish-center-featured-on-msnbc-com/">Pacific Jewish Center Featured on MSNBC.com</a>. In addition, I now need to thank MSNBC for informing me of one of the craziest ideas I have ever heard.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Today is Earth Day and I have gone on record supporting conservation and many green initiatives. I believe conservation is an important part of a Torah lifestyle. (See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/22/earth-day/">Earth Day and Torah</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/15/green-post/">Green Post</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/07/the-story-of-bottled-water-review-important-video-way-over-the-top/">The Story of Bottled Water Review: Important Video, Way Over the Top</a>.)<span class="textSpacer"> </span>While I love the idea of being environmentally conscious, to me it is just a factor in making choices. We all weigh our priorities when we make choices and Going Green is something to consider among other factors.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>To illustrate, if one was confronted with the theoretical choice of saving a life or making a more Green choice, it would be obscene to suggest that the Green choice would be more important than saving the life.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>There is a woman who was on MSNBC who suggested that people consider the environmental effects of having children.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Yes, having children.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>She has all sorts of lovely data about the carbon footprint each child makes on the environment and therefore she urges people to consider those factors while decided if they should become parents.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>All with a straight face.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>If one is uninterested in procreating that is their own personal choice. But to evangelize in favor of not bearing children because of a reason like &quot;carbon footprint&quot; is, in my opinion, obscene. Thinking &quot;green&quot; does not mean that one should cease to think about anything other green. It means that we should consider the environment when making choices.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>It barely even makes sense. I thought one of the main reasons people are concerned with the environment is so our children will have a safe and clean planet to enjoy. Who are we saving the planet for, if not for the next generation? Yes, I know, OTHERS will have children, but the point remains.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>The right to bear and beget children is considered a Fundamental Right implicit in the Constitution. It&#039;s a big deal. You don&#039;t whiff on parenthood because of environmental concerns!<span class="textSpacer"> </span>I recommend reading her article on <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2010-03-30-gink-manifesto-say-it-loud-im-childfree-and-im-proud/PALL">grist.org</a> to see if it makes any sense to you.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>The best part is when she says &quot;I have lots of friends with children&quot;. That is just like the &quot;I have lots of [insert minority] friends to &quot;prove&quot; you&#039;re not a racist. It means nothing with regard to racism and it means nothing in this context as well.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Then she has the whole &quot;parents lose out on so much&quot; argument. What do parents miss out on? and I quote:<br />
<em>Time and emotional energy to invest in friendships and a romantic partnership.&nbsp; Space to focus on a career or education or avocation.&nbsp; Uninterrupted &quot;grown-up&quot; conversations.&nbsp; Travel that&#039;s truly impulsive or leisurely or adventurous (and never involves zoos).&nbsp; Unpremeditated Saturday nights on the town and Sunday brunches out.&nbsp; Opportunities for political or community engagement.&nbsp; Stretches of quiet for reading or writing or relaxing.&nbsp; A non-child-proofed, non-toy-strewn, non-goldfish-cracker-crumb-riddled home.&nbsp; Eight peaceful, uninterrupted hours of sleep a night.&nbsp; All without any guilt that one should be spending more quality time with the kid.</em><br />
First of all, parents do not &quot;miss out&quot; on all of that stuff. I know parents who enjoy many of those activities. Second, are these really compelling reasons? Those are the top things parents are missing? Sounds like trying to live a permanently immature lifestyle. Enjoy that.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Of course, Ms. Hymas would never want someone who was going to have children, not have children. This article is just for all the people who are on the fence or need something to use an excuse for why they are comfortable not having children. I just don&#039;t get it.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Even that silly logo up top (taken from her article) is inane.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Also, it seems Ms. Hymas has a very immature view of the benefits of having children. And I quote:<br />
<em>Yes, as a childfree person, I&#039;ll miss out on a lot: The miracle of childbirth (though, truth be told, I don&#039;t feel so bad about skipping that one).&nbsp; The hilariously perceptive things that only kids say.&nbsp; A respectable excuse for rereading the Harry Potter series.&nbsp; The hope that my kid will be smarter and cooler and better looking than I ever was.&nbsp; More boisterous holiday celebrations.&nbsp; Someone to carry on the family name (assuming I won the arm-wrestling match with my partner over whose name the kid would actually get). &nbsp;Maybe even the satisfaction of helping a child grow into a well-educated, well-adjusted adult, and the peace of mind of knowing there&#039;s someone to take care of me in my old age.</em><br />
Is she serious? These are the reasons people have children? To read Harry Potter? Hilarious things kids say? Seriously?<span class="textSpacer"> </span>In my view, being a parent is great opportunity to grow as a human being. Learning how to give and love unconditionally and with no expectation of reciprocation is an opportunity. Not a burden. It is a chance to grow up and become a more complete person. Parenthood is about places another&#039;s need ahead of your own sometimes. Being a parent means working on yourself to be a better person so your child will have a more complete role model. Sure, there are fun things about parenting too, but it is so much more than that.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>The only thing I can think of to make sense out of all this, is that when one has no core values one can imagine up any value to the primary value. I find this pretty offensive myself, but I think that is what happened to Ms. Hymas. In her worldview &quot;going green&quot; trumps procreation. I can&#039;t imagine that is a very popular opinion but I guess it is possible.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Either that, or she&#039;s just looking for attention and publicity. In that case, she got what she wanted.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Here she is on the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32450072/vp/36651387#36651387">Dylan Ratigan Show</a>:<span class="textSpacer"> </span>
