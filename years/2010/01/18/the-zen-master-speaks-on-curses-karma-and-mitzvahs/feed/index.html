		<description><![CDATA[The Western understanding of Karma is that a good action puts the one who acts in a good place and one acts negatively puts the one who acts in a bad place. Meaning, our acts are not in the abstract with no effect on the universe. Using that loose interpretation Judaism certainly believes in Karma.

Additionally, the whole idea of hashgacha pratis is that our actions have a direct effect on our Divine support. That sounds very Karmic to me.

And there are even stricter interpretations of Karma that comport with kabbalistic ideas of reward and punishment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know about Karma fitting in to the Jewish religion. I guess it depends how you define it. But we do believe in Mitzvah gorerres Mitazvah and aveirah gorerres aveirah. Maybe thats what you mean by karma. Perhaps it means Hashpah but that would be better defined as a good influence not karma which seems closer to being superstition.]]></description>
