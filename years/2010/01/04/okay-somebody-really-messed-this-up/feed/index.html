		<description><![CDATA[I was just curious if &quot;Ninety-Ninety-Nine&quot; was a typo. If not, why would the &quot;nineteen&quot; rule not apply to the year 1999 as it does for 1995 or 1950.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While we&#039;re at it, could they change it in Israel too?  It&#039;s not great for a Modern Hebrew student to have to work out one-thousand-nine-hundred-and-sixty-nine etc each time a date of birth is given.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Pat Kiernan made this point (mine, too) in an op-ed for Mediaite that got some attention here in NY last week. (Cited in NY Post, etc.)

http://www.mediaite.com/print/welcome-to-20-10/

I&#039;m still not sure where I stand on this. I&#039;m too used to saying &quot;two thousand&quot; to change, even though &quot;twenty&quot; might be more correct. Also, think what you want to be saying 700 years from now.]]></description>
