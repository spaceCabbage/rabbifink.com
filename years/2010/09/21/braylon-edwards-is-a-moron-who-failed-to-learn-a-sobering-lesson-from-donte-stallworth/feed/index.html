		<description><![CDATA[This is incredibly well thought out and stated.  I got a chance to meet Mr. Stallworth this summer out at training camp, and came away with the impression that he is a very respectful guy, who knows he is under a microscope still, and will do everything in his power to live up to and perhaps exceed expectations.  And yes, Braylon Edwards is a moron.

Chag Sameach!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt; In March 2009 he was drinking with Stallworth in the incident that led to a death &lt;b&gt; but he was not charged in the incident.&lt;/b&gt;

He saw his friend kill a man while under the influence of alcohol.&lt;/i&gt;

those 2 lines &lt;i&gt; i thought &lt;/i&gt; gave a different impression thats all im saying.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;but in a civil suit he would have lost (Florida isnt a Contributory Negligence state like alabama) and his settlement was a good move for him and the victims family.&lt;/em&gt;

Right. I was really talking about the criminal charges.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well the only thing i have to say is that it seems from your recounting of events that BE was with DS in the car when he killed a man.  But he wasnt.  He decided NOT to drive and stay in the south beach hotel instead.

but i agree he learned nothing.  he learned nothing from his arrest and subsequent no contest plea in cleveland for aggravated assault, (it appears he may still be on probation from that plea and this could be a violation of said plea and he may need to go to jail for 6 months now on his suspended sentence, but thats a whole other story).

DS would have been found NOT GUILTY (not innocent) as anyone from Miami who has driven on the Macarthur Causway (I-395) knows that when its dark out its impossible to see someone darting from the median which is covered in trees and other shrubbery.  but in a civil suit he would have lost (Florida isnt a Contributory Negligence state like alabama) and his settlement was a good move for him and the victims family.

but in reality, he is supremely lucky to even have a chance to come back to work in the NFL.  i know if i killed someone by drunk driving it would be my last day at work at my job and would be virtually impossible to find another one.

in the end i agree that there is a stark contrast between the 2 and that BE is a moron.  the sad thing is, the Jets choice to allow him to still play is stupid.  They already have one WR suspended for weed, now another who will be suspended for DWI, and issues with sexual harassment looming....

an all around classless organization sending a terrible message....]]></description>
