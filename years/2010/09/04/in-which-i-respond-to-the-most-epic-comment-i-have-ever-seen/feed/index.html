		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for a complete response Rabbi Fink. I do appreciate that you allow full expression on your website.

I could present rebuttals but we just call different things facts and interpret the facts we do agree are facts differently. Paradigm differences. We&#039;ve each had our say and that&#039;s the American way.

I do want to tell you this, however. I believe I am a greater friend to you than Mahmoud Abbas and 99.9 percent of all those that call themselves Muslim and refuse to restrain or even speak out against their violent brethren, including the stealth jihadist, the unable-to-denounce-Hamas-Imam Rauf.

Fundamentalists aren&#039;t cool until the chips are down. If jihadists come gunning for you, they won&#039;t care whether or not you supported moderate Islam any more than Nazi Germany cared whether a Jew had converted to Catholicism. My kind of people will offer you shelter and arms. Then our fundamentalism will be much easier to accept.

However, lets hope that day never comes. You hope in moderate Islam. I&#039;ll hope in the essential conservative nature of America and being a watchman on the wall. Maybe the two hopes working together can help reform Islam into a truly peaceful religion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark,

They have every legal right to build the mosque.  I haven&#039;t heard anyone say otherwise.

Other Americans have every legal right to assemble, protest, and share their views and opinions with others.

So many people in so many forums have argued that these people are moderate Muslims, and have nothing to do with jihadist Muslims.  I am questioning the veracity of that statement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Adam - &lt;i&gt;what percentage of them are against terrorism?&lt;/i&gt;

It doesn&#039;t matter. US law doesn&#039;t require someone who builds or worships at a mosque to renounce terrorism before building or worshiping. How many Christians support violence against abortion clinics? Should we not permit the building of churches unless they are thoroughly vetted first?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What percentage of strictly observant Muslims are against jihad?  As Islamic world domination through jihad is part of strict observance, this becomes an oxymoron.

A better way to phrase it is - what percentage of Muslims who observe everything else in the Koran, have decided to throw their faith away in the Koran when it talks about world domination through jihad?

How many observant Muslim &quot;moderates&quot; are there really?

I know some personally, and they themselves admit that their numbers are rapidly shrinking.  A few have started to search for another theology, simply because it&#039;s too hard to be anti-terrorist in a mosque today.

What happens when a guest lecturer is invited to speak in the Park51 mosque?  What happens when this speaker talks about the grand tradition of building a victory mosque, and how this mosque, in this place, having overcome so much objection, represents victory over the infidels?  Will you regret you support then?  Will your regret mean anything by then?

The free exercise of religion in the USA is not an absolute right.  Incitement to violence is illegal, even in a religious context.

KORAN [5.51] O you who believe! do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.


HADITH Sahih Muslim [41:6985] Abu Huraira reported Allah&#039;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying:
The last hour would not come unless the Muslims will fight against the Jews and the Muslims would kill them until the Jews would hide themselves behind a stone or a tree and a stone or a tree would say: Muslim, or the servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me; come and kill him; but the tree Gharqad would not say, for it is the tree of the Jews.

So again I ask - what percentage of people who pray five times daily, follow halal dietary rules, abstain from alcohol completely, fast every day of Ramadan - what percentage of them are against terrorism?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a few brief comments and questions.

&lt;i&gt;There are a small number of fundamentalist Muslims that are trying to kill people.&lt;/i&gt;

What&#039;s your source for this statement? If you look at a list of current conflicts in the world, most of them have Muslims on one side, the other side, or both sides. Or perhaps share with us your definition of &quot;small number&quot;.

&lt;i&gt;Fox News is owned by a supporter of Terrorism.&lt;/i&gt;

Fox News is owned by tens of thousands of shareholders, but I will assume that you are referring to Alwaleed Bin Talal here. He&#039;s also known to be a rather moderate Muslim (though definitely has contributed money to causes that I strongly oppose) that has even done business with Jews in the past.]]></description>
