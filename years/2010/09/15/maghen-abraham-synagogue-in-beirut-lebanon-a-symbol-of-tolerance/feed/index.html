		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;I support BOTH projects but I do not think they are quite the same.&lt;/i&gt;

Not only are they not &quot;quite&quot; the same, they are not at all the same.

With regards to park51, it has nothing whatsoever to do with the attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center buildings and the murder of 2752 people in that attack. It is simply a community center (that contains a small mosque) that happens to be planned to be built a few blocks from the site of the destruction. I am therefore in favor of building park51 as I don&#039;t oppose the building of any community center (provided it funds and supports itself for the most part).

With regards to this synagogue, first of all, it existed long before any belligerent acts between the parties in question. It served the &quot;thriving&quot; Jewish community in Lebanon for many years. Second of all, it&#039;s destruction was brought about by a war against enemies of the Jews. Finally, the restoration of the synagogue is being used as a public relations ploy to highlight &quot;tolerance&quot; (falsely). Meanwhile real tolerance hardly exists in countries like Lebanon that are torn apart by sectarian strife, by lawless terrorists in their midst, and by constant meddling of stronger neighboring countries. There is little justification for restoring this synagogue other than perhaps for historical purposes, as there are hardly any Jews remaining in Lebanon that would use it.

Want to measure tolerance (of Jews in this case)?  Just for example, see how many Jews lived there in the early 70&#039;s (20-25 thousand) versus how many live there today (100 or so). If you want an example of a tolerant country, look to one like Germany (where, for example, Jewish population is said to be growing more rapidly than any other country in the world).

You want to see tolerance, look to how a country treats its people first - do they have freedom or do they lack freedom? Freedom is the first step toward tolerance, statements and most actions by non-free countries are generally suspect. &quot;Official positions&quot; are close to meaningless.

&quot;When people criticize Zionists, they mean Jews. You are talking anti-Semitism.&quot; -- Martin Luther King Jr.

There are only VERY few exceptions to this statement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;it obfuscates the fact that global antizionism is in fact a guise for antisemitism.&lt;/em&gt;

In your opinion...

And perhaps if the distinction were more known, the anit-zionists would realize that they are not anti-semites!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You point out, correctly, that it is *possible* to be anti-Zionist without being antisemetic.
This statement is true in it&#039;s most narrow legeal construction.
But it obfuscates the fact that global antizionism is in fact a guise for antisemitism. The fact that an exception is possible does not undermine the rule.]]></description>
