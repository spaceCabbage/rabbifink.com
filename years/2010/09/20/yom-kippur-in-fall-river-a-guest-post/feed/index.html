		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m about three paragraphs in. I couldn&#039;t wait to comment. So amazing!!  Maybe someday I&#039;ll write my New Bedford version. Never mind, I guess it would have to be a virtual carbon copy. Bittersweet at best

thanks : )   It was just one short day; you have carried responsibility on your shoulders  for a quarter of a century  10,000 miles away from home. May hashem bless you and Shmuel with Brachos &quot; lmali min  hateva.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[my dearest big brother-









Dear Big brother,
I do not have many conscious memories of Fall River, for I left the small town when I was rather young, yet I felt such pride when I  read what you did and what you wrote.  You really are an example to our whole family for your sense of responsibility goes so deep.  You have always felt an unselfish need to give to those who gave to you and this is an inspiration to us all. Thank you for sharing this with us.
With love from South Africa-
Your baby sister]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As Pres. of the shul, it fell on me to try to make sure a minyan would be present for Yom Kippur, after all, the Chazan was coming from NJ for the 4th year in a row, and I felt it my duty to guarantee a minyan. I found out the day before that Shimon Pepper was coming, and after all he is my wife&#039;s first cousin, I had to make an extra effort. To my delight and surprise we not only had a minyan for Kol Nidre, but all the way through Neila and Maariv after Shabbos. What a pleasure it was to see some semblance of the &quot;old days&quot;, when if you got there 1 minute late, you had to stand in the back of the auditorium because there were no seats. Shimon&#039;s personal account of his experience, left me with a renewed hope that maybe everything would be all right I am forever the eternal optimist, and am not afraid of hard work, so if that is what it takes, as the kids say today &quot;bring it on&quot;. Our shul is open to all who would like to come and worship, and to all we say &quot;welcome !!&quot;
