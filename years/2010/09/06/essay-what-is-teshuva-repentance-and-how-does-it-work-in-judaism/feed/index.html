		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;who differentiate between guilt as a negative and regret as a positive&lt;/i&gt;

Regret can become negative. Regret that is not dealt with appropriately can morph into guilt and be harmful.

&lt;i&gt;Rambam in his description of the Teshuva (repentance) process lists regret (charata) as one of the main ingredients of that process.&lt;/i&gt;

Using regret as part of repentance is a great way to use regret. The section of the essay that uses regret negatively is outside the framework of repentance. It was used as support for the teshuva ideal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just for the record, although I understand this writers point of view, there are Rabbis &#038; mental health professionals who differentiate between guilt as a negative and regret as a positive. Not only that, but the Rambam in his description of the Teshuva (repentance) process lists regret (charata) as one of the main ingredients of that process.
Wishing all a happy &#038; healthy new year.
