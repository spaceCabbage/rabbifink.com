		<description><![CDATA[&#062;According to Google, Google Instant saves an average user 2 hours per year. That is a lot of time. Over the course of a couple decades it would save a user an entire day.

Ya, but you aren&#039;t getting a day to &#039;use&#039; or two hours to &#039;use&#039;

You are simply saving a couple of seconds here and there. Email has saved a lot of time that perhaps can actually be measured. But really, the time saved, only means I have a lot more to cram since more people want something from me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Barry, thanks for stopping by.

I am all for time savers and efficiency. This is just a reminder that when we do save time we need to use the saved time as productively as we can.

Just something to think about...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for covering it!

As you may know, I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cartoonbarry.com/2009/02/do_i_have_over_efficiency_synd.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;obsessed&lt;/a&gt; with saving time and I personally love anything that will give me more time to do more things.

What would I do with the time?  Try to make for a better business, try to help more people in areas I am knowledgable in and try to make myself a better person.

Time is one thing we are very limited in and one thing we can&#039;t make more of no matter how much we tried.  So making the most use of my time, imo is important.

If I was a more important person, like the President or a big Rabbi, having more time to deal with daily issues might be useful, don&#039;t you think?

I do see your point, but I am a huge fan of making things more efficient and saving people more time.  Not just for $$$ purposes, also for making yourself a better person...

Now cutting people off while driving might be selfish but making search faster to save a single user 2 hours per year is valuable imo.]]></description>
