		<description><![CDATA[One of the questions in that mini quiz was about a public school teacher reading from the Bible as an example of literature.  A majority of Americans thought that this was illegal.

I clearly remember, in the public high school that I attended, that one of the most popular literature classes was Bible Lit.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t say to believe in God by default. I said Judaism is a Jewish person&#039;s default religion.

A believer who believes by default is not much of a believer and as you point out is the same as an atheist who by default does not believe in a God.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Believing in god by default is no less moronic than deciding to become an atheist. Why is the fact that I am born a Jew make me any more certain that there is a god than an atheist&#039;s certainty that there is none?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An atheist is someone who is certain that there is no God. Making that kind of decision without investigating its truth is not atheism, it&#039;s moronism. Learning about religion is the investigation.

If you are Jewish by race, your default religion is Judaism. But it behooves all Jews to be confident in their religion ans at least treat it as a choice.

Finally, kiruv klowns say all kinds of idiotic things. Mazel tov.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why do Atheists have to check out all religions before choosing to be atheists? Besides if they don&#039;t believe in god that knocks off many religions. Do I have to check out all religions before choosing Judaism? Also, this goes against the basic kiruv premise that 95% of atheists are ignoramuses (heard that at  speech from a kiruv professional).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I took the 15 question quiz and noticed that some of the questions were more about the history of religion than about religion itself. Are they one and the same? Maybe. But the questions were still more history-related than necessary.

Oh, I got one wrong (&quot;Which one of these preachers participated in the period of religious activity known as the First Great Awakening?&quot;).

The quiz that I took is located here - http://features.pewforum.org/quiz/us-religious-knowledge/]]></description>
