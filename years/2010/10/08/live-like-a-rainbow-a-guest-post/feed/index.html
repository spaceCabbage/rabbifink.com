		<description><![CDATA[Very nice!

&lt;i&gt;The pure, unblemished sun’s white light which warms and sustains our entire world is a seemingly boundless and unlimited source of energy.&lt;/i&gt;

I once read an article about &quot;Why earth?&quot;, which discussed the reasons why life developed on earth and not on any other planets (as far as we know, obviously). And one of the conclusions was because of our sun, our distance to it, and our atmosphere, created the exact conditions of sunlight that was conducive to the formation of life from the various building blocks that were available (and are available on many planets). I wish I could post a link, but I can&#039;t find the article right now.

Shabbat Shalom and Chodesh Tov everyone.]]></description>
