		<description><![CDATA[Dear Rabbi, 
Ok, so I know the previous rabbi at your shul, who was also a Ner Israel graduate, and I have to say that he seemed to have more halachic knowledge than you do. Let me tell you a little about the Halachos of Dan Lekaf Zechus. 

1) The Chafetz Chaim actually brings the halachos very clearly in the Be&#039;er Mayim Chayim on the bottom of Sefer Chafetz Chaim. He says that one is obligated to judge favorably only when it doesn&#039;t look incriminating; when it is a fifty/fifty chance that the person sinned. However, when it is incriminating lookin- &quot;noteh lekaf chovah yoseir&quot;- there is no obligation to judge favorably. Here, there isn&#039;t much benefit of the doubt to give. What you see is what you get; a woman exposing herself in an inappropriate way. 

What she transgresses is a different question, but it is at least clear that she transgresses lifnei iver. In addition, there is a possibility that we are dealing with abizrayhu dearayos. In other words, when dealing with issues of  sexuality, even things that are only sexually suggestive can actually be prohibited according to the Torah. In other words, if a woman who is an erva (i.e. a nidah) then attempting to look attractive to other people in a suggestive way is probably prohibited by the Torah. Just thought you should know, as you are the Rabbi of a shul ;). Hey, don&#039;t worry, I&#039;m in outreach, so I know, you don&#039;t always have to know a ton to get the good position. Maybe it&#039;s your good looks, your charm, or the fact that you are a great speaker. But don&#039;t forget Halacha!]]></description>

BTW, what is this I see you discount tznius throughout this comment section with lines such as &quot;it isn&#039;t d&#039;orysa or d&#039;rabanan&quot;? Does Shulchan Aruch or &quot;shok b&#039;isha ervah&quot; mean anything to your brand of Judaism? Sounds awfully close to Reform.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With all due respect, I can&#039;t think of a more anti-Torah thing to do than desire for, apply to, and actually appear on a show that clearly promotes an anti-Torah value. Tznius is no less an integral part of the Torah as is Shabbos. Unfortunately, this is a very sad case of a very confused young woman who quite obviously never learned a thing about what it means to be a Jew who is honest about her Judaism. I don’t know anything about her bio, but who were her rabbis, teachers and parents who allowed this girl to appear on this show? Let’s be honest here, she plainly stated when joining the cast of the show that she has no interest in upholding the Torah in its totality. You can’t keep one mitzvah while abandoning another, and be considered an Orthodox Jew. Not only do I feel sorry for Esther, but more so for anyone who actually felt appearing on this show was a proper Jewish expression and advised this nice Jewish girl to do so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To me, Esther is using modeling as a gateway for orthodox exposure. She may not be perfect, but she is definitely showing people a side of religion many people don&#039;t get to see often. She is not forgetting her roots (she struggles to remain kosher throughout the show), but showing that she is a MODERN Orthodox Jew. Modeling is not about showing off yourself, but is advertising by being part of the picture for a product or item. As a model Esther could speak up about religion and show girls how to be beautiful without being overly revealing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lmnop613 - &lt;i&gt;The whole point of modeling is to say &quot;look at my body and not my nishama. all that matters are my externals.&lt;/i&gt;

Wearing a &quot;hot chanie&quot; dress, a fancy sheitel, and calf-high boots is &lt;b&gt;ALSO&lt;/b&gt; saying &quot;look at my body and not my nishama&quot;. Bang, boom, zoom, half of the 5-towns is suddenly out of Orthodoxy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I responded to the comment you referenced.

So we can agree that its not a kiddush hashem. Would you say its a chillul hashem?

I&#039;ll agree, its probably not d&#039;oraysa, although its probably a derabanan.

You are right - I reread your earlier post - your point was not to judge her - alhtough its a little difficult to tell what your point was in that post. My point is not to judge her in the sense of determining whether she is a good or bad person, or anything of the sort. She can be a nice, generous person for all I know. However, she engaged in very public behavior while identified as an Orthodox Jew. It is those actions that we are discussing here, as you did in your previous post.

If you get a chance to find a more precise cite, I would like to the gemara you mentioned, and how we pasken. I was always under the impression that it was dependant on a chezkas kashrus.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How would _you_ compare the two (theoretically, of course)? What practical ramifications, if any, would each have (you mentioned that they&#039;re different... how so)? To me, both are mumar l&#039;teiavon, and therefore, while possibly passul from a communal honor (but that&#039;s a call for the local mara d&#039;asra), full fledged Jews, and entitled to call themselves Orthodox or whatever other term they want. I would challenge neither on such a call, although I would note that certain aspects of each of their conduct does not represent Judaism.

Unless, of course, either claimed that their behavior was sanctioned or encouraged by Judaism. It would seem quite clear to me that both are incorrect, and as such, might very well fall into the category of apikorsus.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As an example, eating non kosher food does not make one a מומר לכל התורה כולה, yet if someone would get on national TV and eat a pig in a pig eating contest - while being שומר שבת, the majority of people I know would not consider him/her to be orthodox.

This might be because I live in an isolated and insular community, but I doubt it.]]></description>
