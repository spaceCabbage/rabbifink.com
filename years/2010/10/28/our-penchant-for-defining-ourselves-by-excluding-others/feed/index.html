		<description><![CDATA[1) ..and different actors.

2) Why is it OK to teach your congregation, but not the rest of klal yisroel? For leaders, such as R&#039; Hershel Shachter (who gave a shiur to the RCA membership prior to their vote regarding Avi Weiss), would all of his talmidim and those who look to him for guidance (in that case, the RCA membership) be considered his congregation? YOUR assessment is that RAV is not a &quot;threat,&quot; which would imply that you would be more inclined to support a public stance against his hashkafas, were they sufficiently threatening. That being the case, are the learned and experienced rabbis not entitled to make their own assessment of whether he is a threat (which sounds to me like a judgement call).

3) That is an honest (and telling) answer. When you say &quot;lack of precedent to the contrary in the classic sources,&quot; do you mean that you are sufficiently versed in the classic sources to make such a statement, or just that you are not aware of any precedent to the contrary? What if I were to find support in the classic sources (whatever that means) that our leaders are expected to speak out against threats to the Torah, and that they will be taken to task after 120 if they had the opportunity, but failed to do so. Would that change your opinion?

4) What do you mean by &quot;classic sources?&quot; 

5) Do you not look to our great rabbis, such as Rav Hirsch, the Chasam Sofer, Rav Moshe Feinstein, and their writings for guidance as to the Torah approach?

6) The point that I am trying to get at is that it is all fine and good if you have your own, personal penchant not to define by exclusion, because you find it personally offensive. I just hope that your readers (and congregants) don&#039;t confuse your personal predisposition on the issue with an opinion that is based on a careful review of relevant halacha, Torah hashkafa, and rabbinic literature and practice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) Same phenomena. Different scale.

2) It&#039;s not necessary. Teach your congregation and teach your family as you see fit. Weiss is not a &quot;threat&quot;, nor is a non-tzanua MO girl.

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, and I thought i was the progressive thinker in the family.  While the disease of putting others down to make an individual feel better about them self is rampant in all branches of Judaism (and our culture in general), I think the alternative is not to pretend that such lines should not exist.  We can love someone and accept them even if they cross our lines. (Let he who is without sin...)  Nevertheless, lines serve to keep us who we are.  It is unfortunate that many feel the need to measure others by &quot;our&quot; lines or Halachic lines, but those lines are real.  There is a real danger of erasing them by stating that strict adherence to them is just a means of defining ourselves through putting down others.  We are already defined by Halachic principals.  I thing the real danger is those who claim Halacha stands for principals which it does not.  Those who use the banner of &quot;Halacha&quot; to brand other people as &quot;non Orthodox&quot; are often the biggest ignoramuses of all.  Indeed, isn&#039;t a principal of Halacha not to embarrass someone in a public forum?  We should all look in the mirror and do what we can to improve ourselves without wasting so much time violating Halacha and pointing out others shortcomings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A few points:

1) I dont think you can compare &quot;MO Jews excluding Avi Weiss&quot; to &quot;MO Jews excluding... Esther Petrack.&quot; In the case of Avi Weiss, there was a lot of attention from the press (both Jewish and secular) and blogs, rabbinic literature, and most significantly, a decision, reached by membership vote, of the major MO rabbinic body to reject Avi Weiss&#039;s hashkafah. In the case of Esther Petrack, you had a handfull of bloggers commenting on her appearance on ANTM. 

2) Your stated preference is not to define by exclusion, unless &quot;halachkily mandated&quot; or &quot;absolutely necesary&quot;. Using Avi Weiss as an example, I think that those that felt the need to publicly reject his hashkafa (i.e., Agudah, the RCA, and many individual rabbis) DO find it necessary to so because they believe it is their reponsibility to teach the generation about what is and isnt authentic Judaism, according to the Torah. After all, they are rabbis, and I think it is well within the role of a rabbi to teach Torah. There are many examples in our history of great rabbis taking public stances against what the view as encroachments against authentic/Torah Judaism, and in many cases publishing seforim on these issues. A few examples that immediatiely spring to mind are R&#039; Samson Rafael Hirsch, the Chasam Sofer, the Vilna Gaon, and the many examples of book bans in our history. Which brings me to my next point...

3) For the sake of clarity, when you state your preference not to define by exclusion, unless &quot;halachkily mandated&quot; or &quot;absolutely necesary,&quot; and that you &quot;find definitional barriers offensive,&quot; is that preference something you see as rooted in halacha/Torah hashkafa, or a completely personal preference? If it is based on the Torah, I wonder what your precedents/sources for that are?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Shocked? Where?

your post.

&#062;Absolutely false. Everyone does it. Not just orthodox Jews.

If true, than nowhere near what you are trying to imply in your post or the example at hand about Esther.


&#062;You just MADE my point. When we were in the ghetto we did not do this (to the same extent). In contrast, during the Temple period when we had autonomy and post-ghetto we do employ this exclusionary attitude.

Sorry, than I read your statement wrong. 

&#062;No. I want unadulterated tolerance unless halachically mandated otherwise. End. Full Stop.

Then you really are defeating any sort of spirit that Judaism tries to impart on the man. It all boils down to black and white halacha. Somethings are technically permitted, but should it be done? Somethings we don&#039;t tolerate even if technically, halacha does not forbid it. A comment like Esthers, SHOULD be looked at with disgust, and if she goes through it, while still claiming to be &quot;an orthodox Jew&quot; then I am not surprised by peoples disgust toward her in general.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbifink said above:

&lt;i&gt; Personally, I find definitional barriers offensive unless absolutely necessary  &lt;/i&gt;

The definition of &quot;Who is a Jew&quot; is absolutely necessary, and clearly elucidated in halacha.

The definition of which actions (and which non-actions) constitute shmirat hamitzvot is also absolutely necessary.

Using a term like &quot;Judaism&quot; goes into a gray area.  Many shomrei mitzvot equate shmirat hamitzvot with &quot;Judaism&quot;.  By that understanding of the term, any theology that steps outside of halacha cannot be considered &quot;Judaism&quot;.

Use of the term &quot;Judaism&quot; in any other capacity is entirely subjective.  I try not to use the term whenever possible, because it (along with &quot;Jewish&quot;), means too many things to too many different people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;What I find most interesting is this need that has been expressed to self define by whom we exclude.

&#062;Once Jews were freed from the ghetto this phenomena found its way into Judaism.

&#062;But when someone so much as tiptoes over the line they are out.

I will not talk about Esther herself, but about your general complaint and specifically, these three comments. First of all, I agree with Dov Kramer on top. You take a vastly nefarious outlook on people that don&#039;t &quot;tolerate&quot; every thing you feel should be tolerated. The truth is, you write a post, you bring this to the public WANTING discourse. In this case, with Esther, you see something odd here and out of bounds, with what we normally see, so you post it. Then, you are shocked that people are angered by what they see. Yes, some want to kick her out of orthodoxy. Some think she did a chillul hashem (which  if they did not play around with the editing....I agree). But nobody, identifies themselves by whom they exclude. The exclude her, for her actions. They exclude her, because YOU posted about her and called upon people to chime in. They exclude her, the same way people would have excluded idol worshipers. Did they identify themselves back then based on these idol worshipers that they excluded? No. They had their identity, proud of it, but when someone did something wrong, they excluded that person. 

If a person is constantly looking at the world through the prism of tolerance, than now I can understand why they come at this from the other end, psychoanalyzing some awful reason for their self identity. 

Regarding your ghetto comment, you are wrong. Jews have always done this. There are interesting letters found between the Essenes and the Temple priests of how they are doing things wrong and blasting them for it. Essenes looked upon themselves as doing the REAL will of God while others did not. 

Your third comment: Welcome to Judaism. A religion of parameters. You simply move the parameters a little farther. But if you want unadulterated tolerance I suggest you join a different religion. Unadulterated tolerance is not  a Jewish value. Yes, we need to love our fellow Jew, but there is also the ideal of rebuke. I say, people are Jews. Let them in anytime they want, but rebuke them if you must.  This reminds me of that old saying: That Christianity is a religion of love but no din, while Islam is a religion of din but no love. Judaism strives for both. There is a time for love and there is a time for din. 

**Please don&#039;t interpret any of this as me agreeing to exclude Esther. I don&#039;t. I just take aback by some of the things you presume**]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am suprised that no one has pointed this out yet, but there are many examples in halacha where defining a Jew a certain way is halachikly determinitave, and often these definitions are by exclusion. Some areas of halacha where defining a Jew a certain way is determinative are: kashrus, eidus, yichud, trumos and maasros, shechita, yayin nesech, etc. Some examples of these definitions are: mumar leteavon, mumar lehaches, chaver, am haeretz, maimon, apikores, b&#039;chlal amecha, not bechlal amecha, shomer shabbos, etc. Some more modern examples of this are the opinions of RMF and other moden day poskim re: Conservative/Reform kedushin, Conservaitve/Reform gairus, participating in synogouge councils with Conservative/Reform, etc. A very recent example would be R&#039; Hershel Schachter&#039;s (alleged) opnion that ordaining women as Orthodox Rabbis is categorized as yaharog ve&#039;al yaavor. So whether you like it or not, these definitions have important halachik ramifications.

Halacha aside, its really not practical to live a frum lifestyle without making use of these definitions. For example, if one were to join a Jewish/frum dating site, they are usually required to self identifiy as some type of Jew, so that other people will know what they are about. If I were thinking about moving to a community, I would inquire about whether there are Orthodox schools and shuls, etc in that community. I imagine that if you had a shailoh to ask, you would not ask a rabbi that identifies himself as Conservative and Reform. I would also imagine that if somebody wanted to join your shul, they would want to know whther you are Orthodox, whether the shul is Orthodox, and maybe even what kind of Orthodox. I have Conservative/Reform Jewish friends, and they would not be upset that I describe them as non-Orthodox. Same thing with local non-Orthodox shuls. Really, the only time there is a conflict regarding this issue is when an individual or group wishes to self identify one way, and others take issue with that self definition. As you pointed out, a good example of this is Rabbi Avi Weiss. While I personally disagree with those who would define him or his students as &quot;beyond the pale of Orthodoxy,&quot; I dont disagree with the need to come up with a working definition of what Orthodox means. I am sure there are times when Avi Weiss is required to make distinctions regarding who is and isnt Orthodox. The only disagreement is regarding the parameters of the definition.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I well understand a Jew is a Jew according to what Mark said:  Born of a Jewish mother
or converted to Judaism properly (so you get to keep Pamela Geller). What I found &quot;extraordinary&quot; about the post was its denial of logic and reality. We are who we by who we aren&#039;t.

G-d divided . . . The Shabbat is holy . . . by what else than G-d&#039;s command. The Torah is the standard of G-d&#039;s instructions for righteousness; you are still Jews, of course, if you define another standard. But don&#039;t expect me to believe that it&#039;s a good thing for everyone to make their own standard (and that&#039;s what it seems to me. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but there doesn&#039;t seem to be even a pretense that it&#039;s an interpretation of Torah; it&#039;s a wholesale piece of idolatory in crafting a new and false Torah) and then hold &quot;inclusive&quot; parties. Call yourself an observant Jew if you will; make up a new crazy type of logic that allows you to do that, okay; just don&#039;t expect sane people to call you anything less than an apostate.

Now if you are saying that Torah is still the standard and that &quot;inclusiveness&quot; is an interpretation, then that&#039;s better. At least its not outright apostacy. But then you have the problem of explaining such an interpretation. And run into the logical fallacy problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it is important for people to understand the difference between different types of Jews. I, for one, do not want people to look at me and think they understand my situation. Just because other people call themselves Jews does not mean others should look at me and think I am just like them. For example, I recently was put in a situation where the administration at my school COULD NOT understand the idea that I could not come in and take a test on Succos. They told me, &quot;But you could take the test if you really wanted to.&quot; I replied, &quot;No, that is conservative or reformed Judaism that you are thinking about.&quot; They said, what is the difference?

So, the fact that other people try to define themselves as Jews DOES effect me, no? That is why I should care. 

If some Rabbi gets on television and starts spewing false ideas against homosexuals and outright hate, should I not be upset that he calls himself an orthodox Jew? (Yes, homosexuality is against the Torah, but many things he said was foolish and a misrepresentation of how to deal with it.) I am disgusted that he gets to call himself an orthodox Jew and make a huge chilul Hashem. Also, he makes me look bad and now, any homosexual that watched his interview will immediately associate me with him. Is that fair? 

I do think we should define ourselves based on what the standards of being an orthodox Jew is. We need not compare ourselves to others, but define WHAT WE ACTUALLY ARE. The main ideas are shomer shabbos, taharas hamishpacha and kashrus. However, there is much more than just that. Can I be a porn star and honestly call myself an orthodox Jew? 

People might have a right to self define. However, when their self definition effects others, is that still their right? 

What if a guy in UCLA wants to call himself an orthodox Jew. In his class there is an actual orthodox Jew. When the time comes for a test on Rosh Hashana, the guy who just calls himself an orthodox Jew shows up and the guy who keeps the halacha does not. The teacher then goes on to accuse the guy who didn&#039;t show up of lying. &quot;The other guy who is an orthodox Jew showed up, so why couldn&#039;t you?&quot; Is it then right for the guy who isn;t actually orthodox to call himself orthodox?

however, just because they shouldn;t call themselves orthodox doesn;t mean we shouldn&#039;t love and respect them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[E Fink - &lt;i&gt;How does it help Modern Orthodox Jew be a better person or a better Jew by excluding Esther? What is the motivation?&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;ll describe a different, and very real, scenario. At my place of work, I am the only Orthodox Jew. There are also many Reform Jews working with me. All my Jewish co-workers take the first day of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur off each year to attend services at their temple. I, on the other hand, take both days of Rosh Hashanah, 2 days of Sukkot, 2 days of Shemini Azeret/Simchat Torah, up to 4 days of Pesach, and 2 days of Shavuot off each year. And people have asked, and continue to ask &quot;Hey, &lt;i&gt;those&lt;/i&gt; guys are all Jewish and &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; don&#039;t take off all those Holiday days!&quot;, and I have to repeatedly answer &quot;Well, they are Reform and I am Orthodox, and we have different rules regarding working on holidays.&quot; And that invariably leads to questions like &quot;But I thought Judaism is only one religion, how can you have different rules?&quot;, etc. So, while I certainly don&#039;t condemn my non-Orthodox co-workers, I do have to exclude them, even verbally, from my sect of Judaism to effect my explanation above. There is simply no choice in the matter.

I think the same might apply to potential marriages between an Orthodox Jew and a Reform Jew whose mother isn&#039;t Jewish but whose father is Jewish. According to Reform rules, that person is Jewish, but according to Orthodox rules, that person is not Jewish. And that leads to lots of problems for a couple that wants to get married in the Orthodox manner and live within the Orthodox community. But it poses no problem at all for a couple that wants to be married in the Reform manner and live in the Reform community.

What I am pointing out using the above examples, is that many of these divisions are done out of necessity. But the additional divisions, those that are needless, those that are put in place due to spite and even malice in many cases, are evil and ought to be done away with. And they are clear violations of the principle of V’ahavta l’reyacha kamocha.

A perfect example of a &lt;i&gt;needless&lt;/i&gt; division is drawing a line placing Esther Petrack outside of Orthodoxy &lt;b&gt;after&lt;/b&gt; it was made clear to us that she remains committed to Orthodox Judaism,and did her utmost while working for the show to maintain her practice of Jewish law.]]></description>
