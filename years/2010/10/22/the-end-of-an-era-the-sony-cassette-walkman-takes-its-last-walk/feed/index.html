		<description><![CDATA[Great post! My first Walkman was an Aiwa too. I got it when I was 8 or 9. I got a good one (also an Aiwa I think) in 1998, even though everyone had discmans by then, because I liked the convenience of tapes, and I had a lot of mix tapes (this was before I knew how to rip music). Finally, I got my last Walkman (this time a Sony) so I could record and playback shiur, when I was in the Mir, and attending a Yiddish shiur for the first time. I still have that one.]]></description>
