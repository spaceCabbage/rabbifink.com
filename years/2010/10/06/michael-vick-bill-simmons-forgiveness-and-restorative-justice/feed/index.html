		<description><![CDATA[I left room for a minority of 3rd category people.

But I want to clarify: The Forgivers do not forgive blindly. But when they are asked some time after the event they forgive.

I think Forgivers would forgive the 9/11 terrorists without needed to hear of remorse. It does nothing for the Forgiver to NOT forgive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this article although I would venture to say I think there is a third category.  I don&#039;t forgive blindly nor do I withhold forgiveness when it is requested of me.  I think that in and of itself is a sin.  I don&#039;t know what that third category IS but I am in it.  Maybe the only one but I couldn&#039;t just look at something like 9/11 and say, &quot;I forgive those terrorists.&quot;  Maybe that helps some people...but not me.  If they had ASKED forgiveness, that would be another story.]]></description>
