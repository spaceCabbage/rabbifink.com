		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for referring me to this article.  I am an animal lover and an observant Jew and appreciate learning more when it comes to this sometimes strange dichotomy.  One of our two dogs is a terrible barker when people come to the door and I did not know this could be seen as &quot;harm.&quot;  I thought the annoyance was worth having potential burglars move on to easier targets.  We have cats as well and where some of our LA neighbors find rats amongst their fig and other fruit trees, we have never seen any on our property.  Still, we have pets because we enjoy them and their hilarious antics and the affection they show, in addition to the protection a big dog affords, etc.  I feel sorry for people who look upon household pets with fear, disdain and disgust.  You are truly missing out on something.  That being said, those who idolize their animals and treat them as humans are misguided, IMO.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When my mom and I in 1941 were hiding in Odessa catacombs I was horrified by the Germans and particularly - by their huge scary Alsatians. Then I even didn&#039;t now that I was a Jew. Later in life, by the time I&#039;ve learned who I was I already had animosity to all dogs and their aggressiveness and the most - their annoying barking. I&#039;ve lost many friends, who were worshiping their dogs. I still have nightmares in which I am attacked by a pack of huge dogs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you do much for your article. I live in the Pico-Robertson area, and have noticed that my Orthodox Jewish neighbor and her visitors appear overly repulsed/horrified by my dog. She is a very friendly, super sweet and sensitive rescue dog, and she has difficulty comprehending why people are so overly jumpy and frightened by her. She doesn&#039;t bark, and would never do someone harm, but I can see why someone might assume that based on appearances. Thank you so much for your explanation, as now I can better understand what those around me are feeling.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I found this very interesting as I often walk my dog around Stamford Hill in London and encounter many families and children whom are clearly petrified of my dog, sometimes I try to talk to the children and explain there&#039;s nothing to be scared of but on most occasions they run away or just freeze. I wish I could educate them and their parents as this fear is pointless and unnecessary, there is too much fear in this world and it&#039;s quite obvious that these children have been taught to fear dogs from a young age. It&#039;s not all negative though, sometimes Max and I do get the odd cheeky smile which makes me happy and I will continue to try and educate my neighbours so they don&#039;t have to be scared anymore.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It depends on what you mean by a &quot;valid&quot; explanation. It may not be justifiable, but it does explain a lot. It&#039;s not just Nazis - there are deep memories of antisemitic non-Jewish authorities using dogs against Jews for centuries. The dichotomy between frum and non-frum Jews is also explainable. Frum Jews, especially charedim, have deeper memories of life in Europe. Yes, those memories may be skewed and inaccurate, but the respect for familial memories ensured a deeper retention of a fear of dogs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Have never had issues with Jewish religion.   Always felt horrified by persecution and holocaust regarding Jews.  BUT despite myself I find my viesws radically changed, after reading this morning that a Jewish court decreed that a stray dog must be stoned by children (in Israel) because of belief he is the reincarnation of someone from 20 years ago.  Beggars belief and alters my concept of Israel, Jews, and jewish religion irrevocably, I fear.   I just read your Apology to Bill Simmons and find you a reasonable man.   However, I can condone no religion with such primitive beliefs and behaviour. They are on a par with the Fillipino and Chinese sects who torment and eat the adrenalin-filled carcases of a previously tortured dog.  This behaviour is regressive and horrible, and illegal in most civilised countries.  What about the legality of such cruelty (the stoning) taking place in Israel?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just saw this having been redirected from DovBear&#039;s adventures in Wicked Son Portrayals, but I will say that I grew up with 3 big dogs and 4 cats in my house. Having grown up with them, I can tolerate them, but I am not a dog lover or fan and probably won&#039;t own one again if it&#039;s up to me (for various reasons, I think they&#039;re pretty obnoxious).

However, I will note that while the dog was seen as a fairly base creature, it wasn&#039;t viewed entirely negatively. The midrash relates that dogs received the mitzvah of neveilah for not barking at the Jews during yetzias mitzrayim. Cats didn&#039;t really exist so much in ancient Israel (probably because it reminded people of their Egyptian overlords) but they did have dogs which were utilized as farm animals helping in the ancient Israelite tradition of shepherding, if not pets outright. A feral dog is a dangerous one, but I doubt that domesticated dogs were ever counted amongst the dangerous animals (anymore so than a tam ox).]]></description>
