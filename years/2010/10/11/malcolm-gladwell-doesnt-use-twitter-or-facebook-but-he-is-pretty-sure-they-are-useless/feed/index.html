		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;SM tools are just that, tools, just like the telegraph, regular mail delivery, and telephone were in years (and revolutions) past.&lt;/i&gt;

They are certainly more than that. Those tools cannot even create loose-ties. SM can create loose-ties and in my opinion strong ties.

The reason I wrote &lt;i&gt;He Is Pretty Sure They Are Useless&lt;/i&gt; is because that&#039;s how I felt he feels about SM. Not just from the article but from his absolute shunning of these tools in his own life.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink - &lt;i&gt;He absolutely dismisses the possibility that twitter and facebook create strong-tie connections.

Just because you agree with him does not mean that &quot;I didn&#039;t read the article&quot;...&lt;/i&gt;

Um, I was kidding about reading it. There&#039;s not way you would blog so much in depth without reading it!

And I do not agree with him that strong-ties cannot be created via SM tools. The only part that I might agree with, is that SM tools cannot provide enough strong-ties as necessary to cause the revolution. Other things are necessary for revolution, and are much more important, as well. Basically, as I stated, SM tools are just that, tools, just like the telegraph, regular mail delivery, and telephone were in years (and revolutions) past. Though I do agree that they are probably better and stronger tools than those of old, and that stands to reason since each generation of communication tools get better and better.

What in his article led you to conclude &lt;i&gt;&quot;[that] He Is Pretty Sure They Are Useless&quot;&lt;/i&gt;?]]></description>

And no, it&#039;s not that since he doesn&#039;t use twitter he is wrong. It&#039;s just that a Luddite wouldn&#039;t be expected to fully grasp the capability of social media. And his twitter / facebook usage betray Gladwell as a Luddite who doesn&#039;t use social media.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I finally read the entire thing closely ... and I get the feeling that you haven&#039;t :-)

&lt;i&gt;Malcolm Gladwell Doesn’t Use Twitter or Facebook But He Is Pretty Sure They Are Useless&lt;/i&gt;

This isn&#039;t quite what he said. In essence, what he did say is that the &quot;revolution&quot; (any of them) isn&#039;t going to take place or be caused by social media. And I tend to agree.

The key statement in his article (which is overly long and could have been complete in an article a third the size of this one) is &quot;&lt;i&gt;By not asking too much of them.&lt;/i&gt;&quot; Basically, he is saying that social media &quot;works&quot; when the expectation of the people on the other end, the readers, isn&#039;t very high. I can give a few real-life examples that have occurred to me since entering the world of social media:

* Ask me to buy your book and I might, in fact, I&#039;ve already done it 3 times. Ask me to write a book with you, probably not.
* Request sponsorship (low $) for a charitable event, sure, I&#039;ve done it many times. Ask me for a thousand dollar donation, not gonna happen.
* Ask me to sign a petition, sure if I agree with it. Ask me to fly to DC for a demonstration at the Capital, not likely.
* Request votes for a particular person running in some sort of contest, I might if I agree with their stand on the issue. Ask me to run for something, not gonna happen.

So, while the &quot;revolution&quot; may &lt;b&gt;use&lt;/b&gt; social media as a tool (just like it used telephones, telegraphs, newspapers, etc in the past), it will be just that, a tool.

As to whether or not Gladwell knows how to use twitter? It&#039;s quite obvious that he doesn&#039;t. But that doesn&#039;t mean that what he is postulating in his article is wrong.]]></description>
