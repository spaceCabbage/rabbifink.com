		<description><![CDATA[&gt;So now TSBP is not God&#039;s word? Who is the reformer / modern / non-fundie now?

Guilty as charged. I believe Chazal added extra measures on top. Shock. Isn&#039;t Rambam that said Chazal were allowed to add things on their own without it being all the way from Sinai?

&gt;I can trust that God knows what He is doing. I don&#039;t trust man.

And yet God entrusts man to do it, and for man to learn a valuable moral lesson here.

&gt;In some circumstances. Not the circumstances of the US Justice System.

Hence, the discussion at hand. I don&#039;t believe the US is murdering people, you do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Nonsense. More rabbinic add ons. It has nothing to do with God. &lt;/i&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Do you yell this at the Torah as well.&lt;/i&gt;

I can trust that God knows what He is doing. I don&#039;t trust man.

&lt;i&gt;You&#039;re smarter than this. You know there is a difference between killing and murdering. According to God, taking the life of a murderer, is not murder.&lt;/i&gt;

In some circumstances. Not the circumstances of the US Justice System.

I think we are about done here...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;There are rarely two kosher witnesses to murder.

Nonsense. More rabbinic add ons. It has nothing to do with God. 

&gt;If taking a life is so abhorrent why are you so eager to do it yourself?

Do you yell this at the Torah as well. &quot;After all God, if taking life is so abhorrent to you, and you ARE a God of justice, than how can YOU ask US to murder?&quot;

&gt;I am taking that lesson. Don&#039;t murder and don&#039;t murder murderers either - UNLESS YOU ARE OBLIGATED BY THE TORAH.

You&#039;re smarter than this. You know there is a difference between killing and murdering. According to God, taking the life of a murderer, is not murder.

Again, I can see this &quot;moral&quot; argument being made by a secular especially a secular on the left, but its perplexing to see it being made by an orthodox Jew.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Well..what if you DID administer it properly, would anything change for you?&lt;/i&gt;

Nope. That is only an argument for those who approve the DP. I tell them it is administered improperly. I hold its wrong under any non-self defense circumstance.

&lt;i&gt;God prescribed two witnesses to the crime. The rest is Rabbinic add ons.&lt;/i&gt;

There are rarely two kosher witnesses to murder.

&lt;i&gt;This is a moral message that indeed the world is to learn from. There is obviously a message learned from the Torah about the taking of a life, a life created in the divine image being so abhorrent to God that the only suited punishment for something like this is the death penalty.&lt;/i&gt;

If taking a life is so abhorrent why are you so eager to do it yourself?

&lt;i&gt;This is a message not just to Jews but to all of mankind. Why is it that we are willing to learn moral lessons for all of mankind in the Torah but not in this case?&lt;/i&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Further, look at the punishment for &quot;False Imprisonment&quot;, it pales in comparison to &quot;Murder&quot;. Don&#039;t equate the two.

Im not equating it. Your argument is that if its not administred properly don&#039;t do it. Well..what if you DID administer it properly, would anything change for you?

&gt;It is not applied exactly the way God prescribed. Not even close. 

God prescribed two witnesses to the crime. The rest is Rabbinic add ons. 

&gt;Further, God did not prescribe it to the US Justice System. It was prescribed to specific people under specific circumstances.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Then you can say that about everything. How many innocents are sitting life sentences and will die in jail??&lt;/i&gt;

One thing at a time. Death is permanent, irreversible. Life in jail is pretty horrific too but no one is being killed. Further, look at the punishment for &quot;False Imprisonment&quot;, it pales in comparison to &quot;Murder&quot;. Don&#039;t equate the two.

&lt;i&gt;This, particular man-made law is exactly the same as the God-made law. And you might need to justify letting for example a mass-murderer sit in jail to the families as well as to the population that is currently feeding him. &lt;/i&gt;

It is not applied exactly the way God prescribed. Not even close. Further, God did not prescribe it to the US Justice System. It was prescribed to specific people under specific circumstances.

Finally, at this point, Life in Prison is LESS EXPENSIVE than administering the death penalty. We can reevaluate if that ever changes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;If you can&#039;t administer the death penalty properly - DONT DO IT! Ergo, an argument against the death penalty.

Then you can say that about everything. How many innocents are sitting life sentences and will die in jail??

Personally, I would simply higher the threshold of evidence needed for a death penalty.

&gt;Nothing to apologize for. But it seems to me that YOU need to justify a man made law that takes the life of another man. I don&#039;t need to justify letting him live in prison...

This, particular man-made law is exactly the same as the God-made law. And you might need to justify letting for example a mass-murderer sit in jail to the families as well as to the population that is currently feeding him.

&lt;i&gt;I&#039;m always surprised when an orthodox Jew makes this claim. Sorry.&lt;/i&gt;
