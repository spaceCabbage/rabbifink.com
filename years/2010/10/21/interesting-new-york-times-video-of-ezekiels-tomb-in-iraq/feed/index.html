		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The Hindus will keep the area where the mosque once stood because the court determined it was the birthplace of Rama and archaeological evidence showed a temple had predated the mosque, according to the judgment.&quot;

Reference to rioting which killed 2000 in India where a mosque was built over a Hindu religious site.

		<description><![CDATA[Several weeks ago, Arutz7 reported exclusively that dozens of new tombs were being added to the Mamilla Cemetery, an ancient Muslim cemetery located on the outskirts of Jerusalem&#039;s Independence Park, but no one is buried beneath them. These faked graves were in fact a Muslim project aimed at taking over land.

		<description><![CDATA[Of course. But the &quot;chill&quot; allusion was too tempting.

I&#039;m wondering if you&#039;ve seen a proposed model for the &quot;cultural center.&quot; The one that looks like &#039;Krystalnacht.&#039; There are revelations about Imam Rauf as a slum lord who doesn&#039;t pay his taxes. And, it seems the Saudi&#039;s have decided not to fund the center. So let&#039;s hope there continues to be more developments in moderate Muslims asserting control. But how much moderate Islam can you expect from Saudi Arabia?

And the recent Muslim Brotherhood call to jihad isn&#039;t encouraging: From Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Muhammad Badi&#039;: &quot;Moreover, they are disregarding Allah&#039;s commandment to wage jihad for His sake with [their] money and [their] lives, so that Allah&#039;s word will reign supreme and the infidels&#039; word will be inferior...

KInd of sounds like a plot to be alarmed about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh Curtis, dont be such a drama queen.

Take a chill pill means &quot;relax&quot;. It doesn&#039;t mean I want to &quot;chill speech&quot;. I welcome debate. I don&#039;t censor comments and I think of all people, you know this.

I just don&#039;t want people&#039;s blood boiling so I recommend taking a chill pill AND THEN commenting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beyond fascinating.

&quot;for all the alarmists who think this means the Muslims are trying to steal our holy places and take over the world, take a chill pill&quot;

They are. Rambam converted to Islam before his death. Moses was really Islamic and the later prophets were paving the way for Mohammed. It is part of basic Islamic theology. it may not be vindictive, but &quot;steal[ing] our holy places [and people]&quot; is the result.]]></description>
