		<description><![CDATA[Lashon hara is one area where becoming more religious really has changed me ethically.  When I was a kid, I thought it was OK to say anything about anyone as long as it was more or less true.  I can&#039;t pretend that I never speak lashon hara today, but I think I do it much less often.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suppose it depends on how you look at it. For example, would it be okay for Artscroll to publish negative things (that were permissible/obligatory 30 years ago against a certain person) in their introduction to their siddurim?

Putting such speech on the Internet, due to it&#039;s permanence, searchability, and linkability is similar to having it included in books that are published and distributed in a widespread manner.

I suppose it depends on what the issue is. For example, if a Rabbi published a sefer containing kefira, you may need to warn everyone, current and future, against using that sefer. But what if it is a person that is known to be engaging in biah with eshes ish? Does the record of speaking out against that person have to remain public forever?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t agree.

There is negative speech in books which are just as much a permanent record and it is justified if it necessary. There is no reason the internet should be different than a book!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[E Fink - &lt;i&gt;Of course, there are times when it is permissible, in fact, even obligatory to say negative things about another person. The idea is to learn when and how to implement those exceptions.&lt;/i&gt;

And even when it &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; permissible, and even when it&lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; obligatory, I would be willing to bet that there is almost never a case in which saying those things in a &quot;permanent&quot; manner is permitted. Hochaiach Tochiach lasts for the period of time during which the person is committing the particular kind of aveira that requires it, but not necessarily after the aveira has stopped and teshuva has been done. Therefore any permanent statement that remains after teshuva has been done is very likely not permitted.

I wonder if any halachic experts have delved into this aspect?]]></description>
