[Alternate blog post title: Sex and the City 2 Billboards Are Offensive To Parents With Young Children.]<span class="textSpacer"> </span>I love LA.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Living in LA has its perks. You get great weather 300 days a year, really friendly neighbors, not too many bugs, plenty of excitement, just enough peace and quiet, the Lakers, and a Shul on the Beach (with a lucky Rabbi). But like any big city, there are some drawbacks to living in LA. The traffic, superficiality,&nbsp;the helicopters outside my window at 2 AM, the expensive housing, and the schmutz.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>What is schmutz? Literally, it means dirt. But in this context it means dirty in a provocative or an overtly sexual manner. (&copy; me this very second)<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Billboards rise like giant monoliths all over the city conveying their messages of sex, wealth and superficial, fleeting &quot;happiness&quot;. Now, most of the time I don&#039;t complain about the billboards. Most billboards are innocuous enough. Some are a little too risque for my tastes, but it is nothing that disrupts my role as a decent human being or a parent. However, the over-hyped, flop of a movie called Sex and the City 2 has crossed the line of decency.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Sex and the City 2 billboards have overtaken the city.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Everywhere you look there is a big ol&#039; billboard with the giant words &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot;.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>The word sex can mean one than one thing. But sex &quot;in the city&quot; has only one meaning. Sex is not a bad word when used in the right context and in front of the right audience. An inappropriate audience would be a listener who is not old enough to understand what the word means, what it entails and when its use is appropriate. It would be wrong to have an open, frank conversation about sex with a young child.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>A seven year old child can read well enough to see the word sex, but is not able to understand the word. There is just no way to have a conversation with a young child about sex. It is not age appropriate.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>My son reads all the billboards (and also tons of books) and sometimes he even remembers the words on the billboards. Sometimes he repeats the things he sees on billboards. One day he was muttering to himself &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. He says &quot;I can&#039;t get it out of my head&quot;, &quot;what does it even mean?&quot;.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>&amp;lt;Quick, change the subject&amp;gt;<span class="textSpacer"> </span>I know all about &quot;Free Speech&quot;. But when an audience does not have a choice or warning about the content of the speech it can be regulated. (<em>See </em><em>FCC v Pacifica</em><em>: The Court accepted as compelling, the government&#039;s interests in 1) shielding children from patently offensive material, and 2) ensuring that unwanted speech does not enter one&#039;s home. The Court stated that the FCC had the authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience, and gave the FCC broad leeway to determine what constituted indecency in different contexts</em>.) I think this rule could apply to billboards the same way it applies to radio.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>The problem is that the speech is being directed at ANYONE who can read, with no warning and no way to shield a child from its message. That includes my son, who was reading simple words like &quot;sex&quot; &nbsp;(or fox, or dad, or mom, or dog) at the age of 3! Do people think it is appropriate for 3 year old children&nbsp;to read words that will be impossible to define for them?! A provocative image is not going to prompt the kinds of questions that a word can. A kid sees a word and can read it, the kid wants to know what it means! What is one supposed to tell their kids?<span class="textSpacer"> </span>If someone was asking me what to do, I would probably try and come up with something clever like, &quot;it&#039;s an adult word and when you get older you will understand what it means&quot;. I guess that is the best I can do. But I find it offensive that young children don&#039;t seem to be considered in what is permissible on a public billboard.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>I think there needs to be some level of regulation beyond what exists now. Am I crazy?

My son is just short of ten and has been reading those signs for years. I just tell him that it is a movie for grownups. If he asks what it is about I say that I don&#039;t know because I haven&#039;t seen it.<span class="textSpacer"> </span>That usually ends the conversation. But you are not going to find a way to police the billboards. It is like the whole &#039;Potter Stewart pornography discussion.

Honestly I would say:<br />
The TV show was about depressed 35-40 year old single women with amazing careers and plenty of money but who are all depressed because they are not married and have no children.<br />
They bought into the feminist movement&#039;s definition of success and realized that they weren&#039;t fulfilled, at which point they were older and had a really tough time getting married.<br />
Then some of them had fertility problems and spent years TTC feeling like failures.<br />
Every time they bought into the superficial view of happiness, they ended up getting hurt by men or they ended up hurting themselves by judging others.<br />
In the end, they ALL realize the value of a long term monogamous relationship and want nothing more than to settle down. <span class="textSpacer"> </span>This movie&#039;s premise is that after &quot;I do&quot; the 4 good friends still need some mommy time so they take a vacation to Dubai to a high end hotel.<br />
In they end, ,they return to their kids and husbands....

I can relate.<br />
We were recently here in Manhattan with my 6-year old son, who noticed the ads on cabs for &quot;Gentlemen&#039;s Clubs&quot; and asked what they were.<br />
My wife responded that they are places where men go to hang out.<br />
My son then asked why there are pictures of women in the ads.<br />
You just can&#039;t win.<br />
We&#039;re making Aliyah this summer, so we&#039;ll see if that helps.

i was asked this round of &quot;sex and the city&quot; questions when the first movie came out. Bill boards everywhere. My older boys assumed that the movie was about ppl having sex everywhere, and the youngers ones were satisfied with an explanation of being of the male or female sex. which i patted myself on the back for until my then 5 year old asked a friend of mine what sex she was. ::faceplam::<span class="textSpacer"> </span>short brief answer, and then distract the child. thats really all you can do, other than move to Vermont....lol

... or most places in Europe. There are hardly any limits on advertisement (or evening TV) there. And the limits can be expressed as a maximum of a few square inches of cloth :-)<span class="textSpacer"> </span>Of course, plain nudity doesn&#039;t really phase kids all that much, it&#039;s the words and the thoughts associated with the nudity that really spurs most of those questions.

Uh, if you have not started answering questions and talking to your children about sex by the time they are SEVEN because it isn&#039;t &quot;age appropriate,&quot; you have a lot more to worry about than a billboard.<br />
Did you know that kids as young as ten are not only having sex but getting pregnant?<br />
that is the part about this whole post that baffles me, that your 7 year old hasn&#039;t had any kind of education from you about sex.<br />
And believe me, if it doesn&#039;t happen soon, he WILL be learning about it from billboards and friends and book and....you get my drift.
