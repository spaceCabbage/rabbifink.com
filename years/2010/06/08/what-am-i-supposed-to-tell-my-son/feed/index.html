		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi - You&#039;re not crazy. You&#039;re not even grouchy. Billboards are a classic collision of the &quot;rights&quot; of private property vs the rights of the rest of us not to be polluted.

The reason is bad here is that the city of LA has CORRUPTLY ignored their own guidelines. THe words are the digital billboards. This is a disgrace. They should be torn down and government officials should go to jail. I mean it.

		<description><![CDATA[Uh, if you have not started answering questions and talking to your children about sex by the time they are SEVEN because it isn&#039;t &quot;age appropriate,&quot; you have a lot more to worry about than a billboard.  Did you know that kids as young as ten are not only having sex but getting pregnant?  that is the part about this whole post that baffles me, that your 7 year old hasn&#039;t had any kind of education from you about sex.  And believe me, if it doesn&#039;t happen soon, he WILL be learning about it from billboards and friends and book and....you get my drift.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i was asked this round of &quot;sex and the city&quot; questions when the first movie came out. Bill boards everywhere. My older boys assumed that the movie was about ppl having sex everywhere, and the youngers ones were satisfied with an explanation of being of the male or female sex. which i patted myself on the back for until my then 5 year old asked a friend of mine what sex she was. ::faceplam::

short brief answer, and then distract the child. thats really all you can do, other than move to Vermont....lol]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can relate.  We were recently here in Manhattan with my 6-year old son, who noticed the ads on cabs for &quot;Gentlemen&#039;s Clubs&quot; and asked what they were.  My wife responded that they are places where men go to hang out.  My son then asked why there are pictures of women in the ads.  You just can&#039;t win.  We&#039;re making Aliyah this summer, so we&#039;ll see if that helps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps if your son got an answer he wouldn&#039;t still be thinking about it

Seems this is or was a perfect opportunity to share what one thinks is appropriate and inappropriate.

With my kids always told them what we thought was appropriate for them. We gauged that based on their questions

good luck]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Honestly I would say:
The TV show was about depressed 35-40 year old single women with amazing careers and plenty of money but who are all depressed because they are not married and have no children.  They bought into the feminist movement&#039;s definition of success and realized that they weren&#039;t fulfilled, at which point they were older and had a really tough time getting married.  Then some of them had fertility problems and spent years TTC feeling like failures.  Every time they bought into the superficial view of happiness, they ended up getting hurt by men or they ended up hurting themselves by judging others.  In the end, they ALL realize the value of a long term monogamous relationship and want nothing more than to settle down.

This movie&#039;s premise is that after &quot;I do&quot; the 4 good friends still need some mommy time so they take a vacation to Dubai to a high end hotel.  In they end, ,they return to their kids and husbands....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My son is just short of ten and has been reading those signs for years. I just tell him that it is a movie for grownups. If he asks what it is about I say that I don&#039;t know because I haven&#039;t seen it.

That usually ends the conversation. But you are not going to find a way to police the billboards. It is like the whole &#039;Potter Stewart pornography discussion.]]></description>
