		<description><![CDATA[Just stumbled on this in preparation for my temple&#039;s &quot;Torah Trek&quot; this coming Sunday.  We&#039;re doing a &quot;manna taste test&quot; and I needed to get an idea of what it might have tasted like.  This blog and the NY Times article were very helpful. Thanks! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very interesting and somewhat coincidental because I&#039;ve been reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Walking-Bible-Journey-Through-Books/dp/0060838639/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;Walking the Bible&quot;&lt;/a&gt; which mentioned this phenomenon of Manna being formed in a natural way. In fact, even today it can be found, sometimes in abundance. I was fascinated when I read that part of the book. I enjoyed reading it and hope to finish the book this Shabbat.

Shabbat Shalom all.]]></description>
