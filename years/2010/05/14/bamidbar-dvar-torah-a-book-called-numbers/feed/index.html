		<description><![CDATA[I like your message.  It is interesting to note that in the census&#039; the numbers are rounded to the nearest 100, excpet in one case where it is tallied as 50.  What probably happened is that the count normally rounded up or down to the nearest 100;  but, when the count was exactly 50, it was decided to not round and stay at 50. The thought being, how is one to determine if one is to round up or down?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Forgive me for mentioning a personal bugaboo (or maybe ba&#039;alei k&#039;riah share this) but the word in the first passuk from which the sefer takes its name is B&#039;midbar or Bemidbar with a sh&#039;va na on the bet, not Bamidbar with a patach.  Grammatically, that is because it is a s&#039;michut (genitive) connecting to the next word Sinai.  This never causes problems with the name of the second Chumash (also a genitive form.)  No one ever calls that Chumash Shaymot.]]></description>
