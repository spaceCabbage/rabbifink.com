		<description><![CDATA[By the way, the quote above from the Torah Mesorah convention is actually available online &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=BNZ9FJ9er-sC&#038;lpg=PA5&#038;ots=XaintmfSjh&#038;dq=yaakov%20weinberg%20tape%20catalog&#038;pg=PA60#v=twopage&#038;q&#038;f=false&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HERE #15a-15e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

I  received the following from another close Talmid of Rav Weinberg, Rabbi Mordechai Weiskopf (who was kind enough to share his name) - quite a comprehensive review of Rav Weinberg&#039;s position on Hashgacha. He also addresses a few of the points we made in our correspondence directly.

R&#039; Mordechai -
I quickly glanced through the dialogue you sent me, and herewith give a  brief synopsis of my understanding of Rav Weinberg&#039;s ז&quot;ל positions on the issues  at hand. Needless to say, I am not commenting on the specifics of a particular  earthquake, let alone of a particular murder; I am listing the fundamentals of the  position as a whole:

In short, the answer to why a particular thing happened  is that &lt;em&gt;Kaveyachol decided that it should&lt;/em&gt;, based on a very large number  of factors. [Rav Weinberg generally used the term &quot;Kaveyachol&quot; for G-d.] Let me  explain:

1. &lt;em&gt;Teva&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nes&lt;/em&gt; are two different things. &lt;em&gt;Teva &lt;/em&gt;are the rules set in place by Kaveyachol during &lt;em&gt;Sheshes Yemei  Bereishis&lt;/em&gt;; &lt;em&gt;nes&lt;/em&gt; is a deviation from those rules. [BTW, see Magen  Avraham 28:12 and Beur Halachah there - MW]

2.However, even &lt;em&gt;teva&lt;/em&gt; does not happen on its own; it is actively  meted out by Kaveyachol (this is the meaning of the Ramban at the end of P. Bo).  Indeed, Kaveyachol is &lt;em&gt;mechadesh betuvo bechol yom tamid maaseh  bereishis&lt;/em&gt;. So, for example, when a leaf falls off a tree, it is not  &quot;really&quot; falling; it essentially being recreated at every instant of its  falling! That is, Kaveyachol is recreating it at each instant- at a particular  place, with a particular &lt;em&gt;apparent&lt;/em&gt; rate and angle of descent, etc. But  he usually decides these elements of its existence based on the laws of  &lt;em&gt;teva&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., what &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have happened had there been a  self-sustaining universe in which things &quot;really&quot; fell.  But he  sometimes chooses, for whatever reason, to recreate things differently - that is  a &lt;em&gt;nes&lt;/em&gt;. So &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is a result of a decision by  Kaveyachol.

3. Now, there needs to be a justification - such a &lt;em&gt;zechus - &lt;/em&gt;for a  &lt;em&gt;nes&lt;/em&gt; to occur (i.e. to depart from &lt;em&gt;teva&lt;/em&gt;). How much of a  justification there needs to be depends on many, many factors. The openness of  the miracle is only one of the factors. To mention just one other, if one is in  a situation where there is a 99% chance of something occurring, it may not be an  &quot;open&quot; miracle if that something does not occur (i.e if the 1% happens). But it  nonetheless requires a greater justification for it not to occur than there is  for something else that has a 70% chance of happening. Simply  put, &quot;odds&quot; are a very important factor. [Although neither might  technically be termed a miracle, it does not matter for our purposes, as we  shall see.]

4. A &lt;em&gt;zechus&lt;/em&gt; is, of course, not only a &lt;em&gt;mitzvah&lt;/em&gt; that a  person did. It includes &lt;em&gt;zechus avos&lt;/em&gt;, the person&#039;s position in  society, the effect on the &lt;em&gt;tzibbur&lt;/em&gt;, what the person will do in the  future, who his children will be, etc. etc.

5. More broadly,  there are a large number of factors that  Kaveyachol takes into account when determining what to do. The nature of which  &lt;em&gt;chukei hateva&lt;/em&gt; are involved is only one set of factors. There is a whole  set  countervailing factors. For example, the number of people affected,  whether the people affected are Jewish and/or tzaddikim, the indirect  impact on Jews and/or tzaddikim. Basically, the rule is that the closer one is  to Kaveyachol, the more He cares for that person, and the more the decision will  be made &lt;em&gt;on the behalf&lt;/em&gt; of that person. This issue is key - Kaveyachol  takes different people into account to differing extents, depending on how  close that person is to Kaveyachol. Accordingly, when we deal with the question  of whether there is Hashgachah Pratis for Gentiles, or for inanimate objects, or  similar questions, we must define our terms: If we mean, &quot;Does  Kaveyachol decide what happens to everything?&quot; the answer is yes. If we  mean, &quot;Was it decided &lt;em&gt;for the sake of&lt;/em&gt; that person or that being?&quot; the  answer is that it depends - sometimes yes and sometimes no, depending on an  infinite number of factors. In general, again, the closer one is to G-d, the  more the decision is made for his sake. But even a Jew does not always have  decisions made for his sake, ואין שוקלין אלא בדעתו של קל תמים דעות

6. This applies not only to a &lt;em&gt;nes&lt;/em&gt; that breaks &lt;em&gt;teva&lt;/em&gt;. Even  in the case mentioned above with 70-30 odds, the closer one is to Kaveyachol,  the more likely it is that Kaveyachol will arrange things for him. So if one  wins a lottery depends both on the odds of winning and on his &lt;em&gt;zechuyos&lt;/em&gt;.  If the odds are very much against him, he requires more &lt;em&gt;zechuyos&lt;/em&gt; to win  than if the odds are not so strongly against him.

7. When things are done because that is what &lt;em&gt;teva&lt;/em&gt; would have done,  yes, that is &lt;em&gt;keri&lt;/em&gt;. But it is important to realize that it is not true  that a person is either in a situation of &lt;em&gt;keri&lt;/em&gt; or a situation of  non-&lt;em&gt;keri&lt;/em&gt;. A person can be a situation of &lt;em&gt;keri&lt;/em&gt; for one thing  (i.e., he does not have &lt;em&gt;zechuyos&lt;/em&gt; to overcome those &lt;em&gt;chukei  hateva&lt;/em&gt;) and a situation of non-&lt;em&gt;keri&lt;/em&gt; for something else (where he  does). The difference may be due to the relative strength of the &lt;em&gt;chukei  hateva&lt;/em&gt; involved, or they may be due to the type of &lt;em&gt;zechuyos&lt;/em&gt; that  he has, or, most likely, both. [Similarly, &quot;nevuah, miracles, and  hashgachah pratis&quot; do not go hand in hand; each requires a different level, and  perhaps type, of closeness to Kaveyachol - MW]

8. Now, since Kaveyachol makes billions of decisions every second, the  &quot;higher level of hashgachah pratis&quot; is not that rare. &lt;em&gt;Keri&lt;/em&gt; is, of  course, also not that rare. But I do not recall hearing from Rav Weinberg just  how common it is, or which way is the predominant one nowadays. I did hear him  talk a great deal about whether Reuven could choose to kill Shimon, but I don&#039;t  have time now to detail the additional considerations that are involved in that  case.

9. &quot;&lt;em&gt;when Reuven decides to kill Shimon, Shimon will only die if Gd has  DECIDED to leave him at the mercy of another human. Otherwise Gd will save him  by causing the gun to malfunction&quot;&lt;/em&gt; - this is accurate. Everything is a  decision of Kaveyachol. But it is also true that the decision might be based on  the fact that Kaveyachol &quot;does not care&quot; that much about Shimon, and thus He  makes things happen as they would if there would be no &lt;em&gt;hashgachah&lt;/em&gt;,  which leads to the practical equivalent of there not being Hashgachah. This is  what we call &lt;em&gt;Keri&lt;/em&gt; - Kaveyachol operating &lt;em&gt;as if He did not  exist&lt;/em&gt;.  [Thinking about it now, it is possible that the word  &lt;em&gt;keri&lt;/em&gt; is applied only to this situation, where the punishment is  inflicted by humans. But I don&#039;t think so. - MW] As far as the blogger&#039;s comment  that &quot;I have heard from talmidim of R&#039; Weinberg that he held this NOT TO BE THE  CASE. He held that we are all subject to the bechira of others.&quot; - this is a bit  complicated, but Rav Weinberg&#039;s point was that although it would take a very big  &lt;em&gt;zechus&lt;/em&gt; for Kaveyachol to take away Reuven&#039;s bechirah, it would not take  as much of a &lt;em&gt;zechus&lt;/em&gt; for Kaveyachol to thwart Reuven&#039;s plot by making  the gun malfunction. And perhaps almost all people are today are  not &lt;em&gt;zoche&lt;/em&gt; to have others &lt;em&gt;bechira&lt;/em&gt; taken away for them, but you  cannot say &quot;all&quot;. More to the point, you certainly cannot say that all people  are not &lt;em&gt;zoche&lt;/em&gt; to protection by having the gun malfunction.

10. Finally, Rav Weinberg maintained that there is plenty in nature that is  non-deterministic. [I think he gave weather as a particular example because  Kaveyachol keeps the &lt;em&gt;mafteach&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;geshamim&lt;/em&gt;, but I am not sure  about this, particularly because the &lt;em&gt;mafteach&lt;/em&gt; is for Eretz Yisrael. In  any case, we &lt;em&gt;daven&lt;/em&gt; about the weather three times a day; evidently, the  halachah does not deem it impossible for humans to affect the weather due to a  &lt;em&gt;gezeirah&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;keri&lt;/em&gt;. Moreover, it must not even be deemed a  &lt;em&gt;nes&lt;/em&gt; to vary the weather, as it is forbidden to &lt;em&gt;daven&lt;/em&gt; for a  &lt;em&gt;nes&lt;/em&gt;. Aside from weather, it is my impression that most things are as  indeterminate on a quantum level. I don&#039;t know about earthquakes one the  predictive factors have reached a certain point. - MW]

All of the above is my understanding, and may be mistaken. I hope I am not  misquoting the Rosh Yeshiva z&quot;l, and I further hope that I make myself  sufficiently clear despite the brevity. I realize that the position outlined  here is complex, but, well, &lt;em&gt;darkei haHashgachah&lt;/em&gt; are not simplistic.

		<description><![CDATA[I emailed a close Talmid and he sent me the following:

&lt;i&gt;The RY said numerous times that despite the fact that in hester panim, the default is keri, that too is 100% hashgacha-meaning we all have a personal relationship with Hashem and though He may not always step in, He always could and we have to live our lives as if He always will if we do our part and create the tefilos and zechuyos that are necessary to effect that. So, it is not just for tzadikkim. Personal hashgacha stories that we all experience are examples of this.  A small example, He once told me that when you &#039;happen&#039; to open the sefer to the right page that is a direct hashgacha message from Hashem that He loves you.&lt;/i&gt;

He also sent me some notes another Talmid took from a tape at a Torah UMesorah Convention called &quot;Seeing the Yad Hashem through Current Events&quot;, by the Rosh Yeshiva ZTL (You can download this mp3 from chinuch.org - MD) Here&#039;s an excerpt that I (MD) copied that&#039;s relevant to our discussion

&lt;i&gt;What are the implications of the Atah Bechartanu? We learn a mishna in Avos but we may not fully understand it. There were 10 doros from Adam until Noach- and Noach took `schar kulam&#039; all of mankind is now centered through Noach. Another 10 doros- Hashem waits patiently. Who will take on the burden and responsibility for all of mankind-being the one through whom Hashem can express himself through the briah-world. Only Avraham is mekabel schar kulam. So Klal Yisroel is the vehicle through which the Hashgachah comes to mankind. There is no way a human being can know Hashem, or be lover of justice, compassionate, good , or caring unless they have had a shaychus with Klal Yisroel. If there are peoples and nations that have never had a shaychus with Klal Yisrael they are savages, barbaric, without any sense of truth or justice. This is because the whole and only method for any person to relate to G-d is through Klal Yisrael.

So Hashem shows Himself in current events for the benefit of Klal Yisrael. Someone once asked me, how can you say that? What was relevant for the Jews in the Vietnam War? The answer is this doesn&#039;t mean that we can always identify what the purpose is but it&#039;s a fact. It happens to be that with Vietnam we can see it most directly. The only real result of Vietnam was how America would react to wars against Israel. It determined how they would send soldiers, spend money. America&#039;s way of dealing with the Arabs is all as a result of the Vietnam syndrome.

When we had a first Bais Hamikdash, we knew the Yad Hashem in a revealed, direct way. We knew why things happened the way they did. In the Second Bais Hamikdash, we no longer see the Yad Hashem revealed. We can only see it through Avodah. But we have a Yom Tov that gave us this koach. Purim seemed to be so natural and just a `current event&#039; but Klal Yisrael saw Haman and the Yeshuah as a Yad Hashem. So we have a Purim. We must see all events in this manner. We must change and become different in order to see salvation. The yesod of Simchas Purim is to be makir that it&#039;s all Yad Hashem. Kavayachol is mechadesh on Purim this koach to be able to see Yad Hashem in all events. We may not know the specifics but we must know that Hashem is bringing it only because of the maasim of Klal Yisrael.

So whenever the world and/or Klal Yisrael has a big tzara, we have to know that it is up to us to change. Every tzara has a refuah before the makkah and through our teshuva the refuah comes out and if we don&#039;t respond properly the refuah will not come forth. This was true for all the wars and pogroms and it is true today. We must respond. If we accept that it is Yad Hashem, we already have 3/4 of the refuah done. Because then we are going to daven differently, to be zahir in mitzvos differently, to be acharai for others differently, to be mekabel a koved rosh, a different style of living, to give up on indulgences.

This is the yesod of Jewish chinuch. The Yad Hashem responds to the avodah of Klal Yisrael. This is the Shma Yisrael Hashem Elokainu. It&#039;s for Yisrael- Hashem shows His Hashgacha for us-He&#039;s ElokaiNU. We need to do and He will respond.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I emailed a close Talmid and he sent me the following:</p>
<p><i>The RY said numerous times that despite the fact that in hester panim, the default is keri, that too is 100% hashgacha-meaning we all have a personal relationship with Hashem and though He may not always step in, He always could and we have to live our lives as if He always will if we do our part and create the tefilos and zechuyos that are necessary to effect that. So, it is not just for tzadikkim. Personal hashgacha stories that we all experience are examples of this.  A small example, He once told me that when you &#8216;happen&#8217; to open the sefer to the right page that is a direct hashgacha message from Hashem that He loves you.</i></p>
<p>He also sent me some notes another Talmid took from a tape at a Torah UMesorah Convention called &#8220;Seeing the Yad Hashem through Current Events&#8221;, by the Rosh Yeshiva ZTL (You can download this mp3 from chinuch.org &#8211; MD) Here&#8217;s an excerpt that I (MD) copied that&#8217;s relevant to our discussion</p>
<p><i>What are the implications of the Atah Bechartanu? We learn a mishna in Avos but we may not fully understand it. There were 10 doros from Adam until Noach- and Noach took `schar kulam&#8217; all of mankind is now centered through Noach. Another 10 doros- Hashem waits patiently. Who will take on the burden and responsibility for all of mankind-being the one through whom Hashem can express himself through the briah-world. Only Avraham is mekabel schar kulam. So Klal Yisroel is the vehicle through which the Hashgachah comes to mankind. There is no way a human being can know Hashem, or be lover of justice, compassionate, good , or caring unless they have had a shaychus with Klal Yisroel. If there are peoples and nations that have never had a shaychus with Klal Yisrael they are savages, barbaric, without any sense of truth or justice. This is because the whole and only method for any person to relate to G-d is through Klal Yisrael.</p>
<p>So Hashem shows Himself in current events for the benefit of Klal Yisrael. Someone once asked me, how can you say that? What was relevant for the Jews in the Vietnam War? The answer is this doesn&#8217;t mean that we can always identify what the purpose is but it&#8217;s a fact. It happens to be that with Vietnam we can see it most directly. The only real result of Vietnam was how America would react to wars against Israel. It determined how they would send soldiers, spend money. America&#8217;s way of dealing with the Arabs is all as a result of the Vietnam syndrome.</p>
<p>When we had a first Bais Hamikdash, we knew the Yad Hashem in a revealed, direct way. We knew why things happened the way they did. In the Second Bais Hamikdash, we no longer see the Yad Hashem revealed. We can only see it through Avodah. But we have a Yom Tov that gave us this koach. Purim seemed to be so natural and just a `current event&#8217; but Klal Yisrael saw Haman and the Yeshuah as a Yad Hashem. So we have a Purim. We must see all events in this manner. We must change and become different in order to see salvation. The yesod of Simchas Purim is to be makir that it&#8217;s all Yad Hashem. Kavayachol is mechadesh on Purim this koach to be able to see Yad Hashem in all events. We may not know the specifics but we must know that Hashem is bringing it only because of the maasim of Klal Yisrael.</p>
<p>So whenever the world and/or Klal Yisrael has a big tzara, we have to know that it is up to us to change. Every tzara has a refuah before the makkah and through our teshuva the refuah comes out and if we don&#8217;t respond properly the refuah will not come forth.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;1) A mussar shmooze can be effective as a wake up call to strive to be the best we can possibly be even if it is unlikely anyone will attain that level.&lt;/i&gt;

I hear that, but I find it hard to believe Rav Weinberg would use those techniques. As one of the Maspidim for Rav Weinberg put it &quot;To the Rosh Yeshiva a Krumma Sevara was the equivalent of dropping a brick on his foot&quot; It seems to me that he would not exagerrate for the purpose of inspiring others. He would let the principles speak for themselves. That&#039;s my impression of him. Either way, I&#039;ve supported the assertion of Hashgacha Pratis as common with other things he said. The Shmooz at the Agudah was just a supportive Maaseh Shehaya. 

&lt;i&gt;2) I agree. One CAN witness hashgacha. But what we are discussed is theodicy. Bad things happening. Good things we can easily attribute to a Good God.&lt;/i&gt;

Rav Weinberg made no distinction between good and bad Hashgacha happening. I don&#039;t see why there would be a difference. It would be nice if he were here to ask him all these questions! I forwarded my comments, and yours, to 2 of his close Talmidim so maybe they&#039;ll clarify this if they have a chance to respond to me.

&lt;i&gt;3) Weather is an area that Chazal have classically taught us is in our hands. Earthquakes? Not so sure.&lt;/i&gt;

He said clearly that Earthquakes, famines, crib deaths, diseases, are the result of human choices. Obviously some of those are through some metaphysical mechanism. 

&lt;i&gt;4) It&#039;s not reality because there is sin and there always has been sin. So a world without sin would be perfect. Mazel tov. We live in a world with sin where hashgacha is not perfect.&lt;/i&gt; 

But it IS reality because that evil is caused by ongoing sin, or distancing from HKB&quot;H as he put it. That&#039;s relavent since it encourages us to move closer to HKB&quot;H by following His will and thereby decrease the occurrences of evil and destruction. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;I call that mussar. It&#039;s not certain that he meant it as a hashkafic statement&lt;/i&gt;

If he didn&#039;t believe it to be true why would he find it an effective message? I don&#039;t know how someone can give Mussar with means that they don&#039;t find to be true in Hashkafa - especially Rav Weinberg.

&lt;i&gt;It&#039;s great to feel that hashgacha. Does it have any bearing on tragedy and every other part of your life when you DON&#039;T feel that hashgacha? In other words, feeling is not relevant to substantive discussion.&lt;/i&gt;

His point was to show that normal people can witness the Hashgacha. Its part of normal peoples lives - that is relevant.

&lt;i&gt;I think what you mean here is that the weather is not &quot;set&quot; so changing the weather is not a nes nigleh. This may be true today. I think the reason the weather is unpredictable is because there are too many factors to consider. So if we had enough information it would be predictable. There is very little in nature that is random. If we think it is random it is likely because of a lack of information.&lt;/i&gt;

He argued directly on your perception. He said that even though there are predictable natural occurences there is plenty of room for &quot;chance&quot; and that&#039;s where the Hashgacha can operate.

&lt;i&gt;Yes. Of course. Without sin, nothing bad could happen to us. There would be no evil in the world. That&#039;s obvious. But it is not reality.&lt;/i&gt; 

I&#039;m confused. If it&#039;s obvious why is it not reality? Do you mean we can&#039;t detect it? 

&lt;i&gt;There is sin and there is evil.&lt;/i&gt; 

He seemed to say that sin is what creates evil. He said the further we distance ourselves from Gd, the further we are from the source of life/good, and such distancing is destruction, evil.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;I recall listening to Rav Weinberg speak at the Agudah in Baltimore telling people to avoid living Bkeri with Gd lest they be subject to Keri. He was speaking about avoiding shady business practices. He must have believed the higher judgment to be within the reach of most people if they&#039;d just straighten out.&lt;/i&gt;

Ooooh! Of course. But I assume we are in a b&#039;kerri status.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;You assume that the v&#039;halachtem imi b&#039;keri is rare simply because it is horrible. This also a flawed assumption. It is horrible. It represents a distance between us and God. But it is the default in a time of hester panim. We suffer this fate due to the sins of our great grandparents. We lost nevuah, we lost open miracles and we lost this level of hashgacha. All equally terrible, but all equally lost.&quot;

I recall listening to Rav Weinberg speak at the Agudah in Baltimore telling people to avoid living Bkeri with Gd lest they be subject to Keri. He was speaking about avoiding shady business practices. He must have believed the higher judgment to be within the reach of most people if they&#039;d just straighten out.  Also, as I wrote, in the recording he pointed to Hashgacha that most people can see when they meet their spouses. 

&quot;Your assumption that earthquakes are equal to flipping a coin is wrong. There is no &quot;chance&quot; involved in an earthquake. We know why and how they happen.&quot;

We also know why and how thunderstorms happen, but they&#039;re not absolutely predictable until they just about happen. The weatherman says 80% chance of rain, because there&#039;s a 20% chance tha it won&#039;t. Within those chances Gd can operate. Rav Weinberg gave weather as an example if I recall correctly.

&quot;I am SHOCKED to see this quote: &#039;when Reuven decides to kill Shimon, Shimon will only die if Gd has DECIDED to leave him at the mercy of another human. Otherwise Gd will save him by causing the gun to malfunction.&#039; I have heard from talmidim of R&#039; Weinberg that he held this NOT TO BE THE CASE. He held that we are all subject to the bechira of others. (This is really a moot point in the conversation as it relates to earthquakes - but I still feel I need to be mocheh. There must be an alternate understanding of this quote.)&quot;

That was Rav Weinberg&#039;s example. With Keri Gd won&#039;t prevent the murder. Without Keri, but direct Din, Gd will prevent the murder if He  wants to.

&quot;To make your final point you need to make 2 more assumptions. The first is that the earthquake was a result of choices. This may or may not be the case. Second you assume that there is a message FROM the earthquake. I disagree. As the Rambam says, when we see tragedy we have to change something. We need to contemplate our lives. There is no element of &quot;causation&quot;. To attribute evil to specific choices that were made is usually just an act of self righteousness.&quot;

He said ALL evil is the result of human choices. He gave earthquakes and crib deaths as examples. I encourage you to research this with his recordings and show my comments to his Talmidim. Its possible I&#039;m misunderstanding, but this is what I heard on the recordings. ]]></description>

1) The &quot;higher level&quot; of hashgacha pratis exists in my understanding as well. It is just very rare and not the assumed level of Interaction. The Rambam holds it is an attainable level but a difficult level to attain.

2) You assume that the v&#039;halachtem imi b&#039;keri is rare simply because it is horrible. This also a flawed assumption. It is horrible. It represents a distance between us and God. But it is the default in a time of hester panim. We suffer this fate due to the sins of our great grandparents. We lost nevuah, we lost open miracles and we lost this level of hashgacha. All equally terrible, but all equally lost.

3) Your assumption that earthquakes are equal to flipping a coin is wrong. There is no &quot;chance&quot; involved in an earthquake. We know why and how they happen.

4) I am SHOCKED to see this quote: &lt;i&gt; when Reuven decides to kill Shimon, Shimon will only die if Gd has DECIDED to leave him at the mercy of another human. Otherwise Gd will save him by causing the gun to malfunction,&lt;/i&gt;

I have heard from talmidim of R&#039; Weinberg that he held this NOT TO BE THE CASE. He held that we are all subject to the bechira of others. (This is really a moot point in the conversation as it relates to earthquakes - but I still feel I need to be mocheh. There must be an alternate understanding of this quote.)

4) To make your final point you need to make 2 more assumptions. The first is that the earthquake was a result of choices. This may or may not be the case. Second you assume that there is a message FROM the earthquake. I disagree. As the Rambam says, when we see tragedy we have to change something. We need to contemplate our lives. There is no element of &quot;causation&quot;. To attribute evil to specific choices that were made is usually just an act of self righteousness.

Again, I thank you for posting this. I just don&#039;t see this as R&#039; Weinberg&#039;s position based on other first hand information I have heard and the plain reading of the Rambam which he was so passionate about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eli - I listened to a number of Shiurim from Rav Weinberg and I&#039;m having trouble connected what I heard with what you wrote. 

Here&#039;s a few relevant statements he made: 

Gd has complete control over everything in creation, which he must by definition since he is the Creator. The only issue is what level of judgment each particular element of creation has. The 6 days of creation was the creation of Natural Law - &quot;Teva.&quot; Unless there&#039;s an open miracle (Neis Nigleh) G-d does not break Natural law. At the same time Natural Law leaves much room for Gd&#039;s control since much of Natural Law is subject to &quot;chance,&quot; like the fact that a coin lands on heads or tails only 50% of the time. Landing on heads is an uncaused event, because otherwise it would be predictable, so Gd works within that unpredictability to manipulate the world as He sees fit. 

To what level does he manipulate/interfere? That depends on the level of judgment (Din) he relates with. 

If 75 people in India have to die Gd will not have a special judgment for each of those 75 people. Each of those 75 will die as part of the greater Judgment involved in Gds master plan. Is that master plan for India, for foreign nations, for the Jewish people or for the whole world? I don&#039;t know. Gd has decided that EACH of those 75 should die, but not for their sake; rather, for the sake of the master plan. 

For the Jewish people Gd has a great level of judgment. That&#039;s what Elokai Yisrael (Gd of Israel) means. That&#039;s what Atah Bchartanu (Chosen People) means. He judges each Jew individually. Whatever happens to a Jew is a result of Gds specific judgment with that Jew. Rav Weinberg gave an example of that judgment by asking people in the audience if when they met their spouse they had seen the hand of Gd. (Another level of judgment is for the completely righteous, Tzadik Gamur. For them G-d gives existence even to entire nations for the sake of that Tzadik who may once pass through there.)

Within that specific judgment Gd can DECIDE (judge) that a person should be subject to the choices made by another person. Free choice is a power that all humanity was given and Gd decides when he should subject a Jew, or a pawn in His greater master plan, to the choices of another human being. He said that for an individual to be subjected to the choices of another human being and not have the Hashgacha Pratis (individual attention/judgment) of Gd is a horrible judgment. I don&#039;t know how common that judgment is, but from Rav Weinberg&#039;s description of how horrible it was it sounded like it was reserved for special occasions. That level of judgment is described when the Torah says &quot;Vhalachtem Imi BKeri VHalachti Imachem BKeri&quot; - &quot;When you deal with me in a manner of happenstance, I will deal with you in a manner of happenstance.&quot; When a person/nation lives in a way that does not recognize Gd in his life, Gd will in turn subject that person/nation to a life without the direct attention of Gd; that is, a life at the mercy of the choices of others. 

Now, when Reuven decides to kill Shimon, Shimon will only die if Gd has DECIDED to leave him at the mercy of another human. Otherwise Gd will save him by causing the gun to malfunction, having a policeman walk by, etc. 

When Levi decides to jump off a cliff he has, with that action of jumping, decided to put himself in a new category of judgment that would require an open miracle to save him. Those miracles are extremely rare after the period of the First Temple. (I believe the miracle of Chanukah was an event where such a miracle occurred, which would help explain why we make a whole holiday out of it. There&#039;s other factors as well). 

Another element of this discussion is that Gd does not, by definition, perpetrate evil. Only good can come from Gd. Evil is created by the choices of man. Those choices directly effect nature, but they can work through a physical or metaphysical mechanism. An earthquake will occur and people will die as a result of man&#039;s choosing. What choices did he make that caused a natural disaster? You need a prophet to figure that out, but certain events leave pretty good clues to what man did wrong and in which direction he needs go to improve. 

He gave the example of Hitler as one whose evil was man made. Hitler was not an evil decree from Gd. Gd was involved in his success - for how else could a gangster become a world leader. But along the way to his success Gd gave the world ample opportunity to stop him and  the world turned a blind eye - THEIR choice. 

So back to Haiti - it seems to me that Rav Weinberg would say there was a master plan judgment involved. The evil that occurred - thousands of deaths, losses, national and global pain is a result of man&#039;s choices. Those choices caused this tragedy through physical and metaphysical mechanisms. Could Gd have stopped the tragedy without an open miracle? I think so. Earthquakes are subject to a level chance, just like weather conditions and like the flipping of a coin. There&#039;s a window there for Gd to work within without open miracles. Why didn&#039;t Gd stop it? I&#039;m obviously no prophet, but I think one does have to think about what the message is. I&#039;ve heard various suggestions of what the message might be, as you have. It seems to me you can never be sure, but if it&#039;s about me improving my ways, or about my community/nation/world then we can only benefit from improvement. If we improve and we were wrong, at least we&#039;re better off than we were before.

This is all my understanding of his Shiurim. I am certainly open to the understanding of others who have heard his Shiurim and I&#039;d love to discuss this. If you could refer me to a recording which argues with the above I&#039;d appreciate it.

Excellent.  I agree also with Rabbi Feldman.  Rabbenu Shafran and Levin are touting their own agendae; I find that distasteful (Shafran 1 and Levin can accurately be described even more harshly, but that tempts lashon harah).  I think we would learn, if we could, that every individual who suffered/suffers from this tragedy chose a path which led irrevocably to Haiti:  G-d leads man in the path that man chooses to follow.]]></description>

It doesnt seem either  right, just or  purposeful.The voice of Hasem is not in the storm,tsunami, earthquake or tragedy of life but in a still quiet voice not everybody can hear because the storm is too loud.
