		<description><![CDATA[The story about Corrie ten Boom is correct.  I know this because my parents  (Germans living in Germany) would give money for her cause.  My parents also hid jews in our home on their way to Holland.  When I was young I would wake up in the middle of the night and hear people coming into our guest room but could not see anyone the next morning.  My parents were devout christians and detested Nazie rule.  I found out 20 years later when visiting with them (I live in the US) I searched for a book in the closet in their guestroom and the back of the closet gave a little, so I pushed harder and the back of the closet collapsed into another room behind it.  What I found were hundreds of illegally kept books saved by my father and a friend from the bonfires ordered by the Nazies.  That is also where they hid the jews, in this small room with a few cots and a chair in it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Corrie ten Boom has impressed me all my life
I love to look at her face
ldspoetrybykellymiller.blogspot.com


In Holland, during WWII
The Jews were being hunted
And like the family called ten Boom
Christians took them in, undaunted

One day, the Nazis laid a trap
Many were killed as bullets struck
2 sisters were sent to camp
In the infamous Ravensbruck

The horrific months were slowly spent
By expressing gratitude for each day
Never did they regret why they were sent
For they had God&#039;s word and they could pray

In the end, Corrie survived, Betsie did not
Once out, she taught the war ravaged of forgiveness
Determined to share what she learned from God
Till, one day came the test for faithfulness

A man approached...she knew his face
He&#039;d been one of the cruelest guards she&#039;d known
And spoke close to her leaving little space
Asking that forgiveness to him be shown

He was now a Christian... seeking for freedom
From the torment of the damned
Wanting a place in God&#039;s kingdom
He sought repentance at her hand

Corrie ten Boom looked at his hand held out
Seconds passed...she silently prayed
God forgives those who forgive, she had no doubt
But this moment heavily weighed

Woodenly, mechanically...then
She thrust her hand into his before her
A warm current of healing sprang between them
She said, &quot;With all my heart, I forgive you brother&quot;

For another moment, their hands held
Amidst tears flowing... there was love
Come of God, intensely by both sides felt
This is what forgiveness is made of

For those who eschew evil and live good lives
Who strive for a brighter and more perfect day
Though there&#039;s tragedy...things get better as one strives
To follow the Savior who shows us the way

From Gethsemane, the cross, and the tomb
He rose triumphant gloriously
And as it is His countenance we weekly re-assume
We&#039;ve a duty to live our lives virtuously]]></description>
