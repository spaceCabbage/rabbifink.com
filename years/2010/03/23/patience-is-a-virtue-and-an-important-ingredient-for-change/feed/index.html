		<description><![CDATA[Ironically, the greatest opposition to women serving as leaders of Torah-observant congregations has resulted from the existence of the rebel sects.

Without them, there would be no slippery slope, no need for instinctive opposition to anything new, and we could all have a calm, rational, halachic discussion about this.

It would seem clear from halacha that women cannot lead most of the prayer service, sing / chant publicly, or read from the Torah.

It is also clear that in many congregations, the rabbi never does any of those things.

The question then becomes, is there an issue of modesty for a woman to call attention to herself in a spiritual capacity by speaking in front of the congregation?

On one hand, modesty has always encompassed more than just clothing style.

On the other hand, it now seems acceptable for excellent observant female orators to speak in large mixed crowds.  (Does Esther Jungreis speak to mixed crowds?)

There is also the issue of motive.  Judaism is all about motive.

I don&#039;t know anything about Sara Hurwitz - although she certainly makes my short list of &quot;people I&#039;d like to have over for a shabbos meal&quot;.   :o)

Almost all of the observant women that I know have neither a desire to be a rabbi nor to have a female rabbi leading their congregation.  It&#039;s not part of our society.

Again, just because it isn&#039;t part of our society now doesn&#039;t preclude it completely - but doing something new simply for the sake of &quot;progress&quot; or &quot;modernity&quot; is, in and of itself, antithetical to Judaism.]]></description>
