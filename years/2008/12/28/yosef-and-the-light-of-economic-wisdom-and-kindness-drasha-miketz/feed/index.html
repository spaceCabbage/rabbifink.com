		<description><![CDATA[[...] Next comment:This one is a little disturbing. It says &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind if my children and grandchildren need to sacrifice, but I am not willing to sacrifice for them&#8221;. This is exactly what got us in this mess. Mortgaging the future for the present was the root of this entire economic mess. America became a superpower because of the willingness of its citizens to work hard and sacrifice for their children and grandchildren. Now, there is a sense of entitlement which has taken hold of our country. People just want their lives to be comfortable and they don&#8217;t care what happens next. We need a shift in attitude to turn the economy around and this is a great place to start. You can read more of my thoughts on this idea here. [...]]]></description>
