		<description><![CDATA[Rav Fink, 

So disheartening for the following reasons:

nice fellow.  a good friend.  his &quot;logic&quot; about the Torah made me concerned -- not you too?

The example of the eye thing? That some nice Jewish girl therapist rediscovered? As a &quot;proof&quot; that &quot;it&#039;s all in there, folks.&quot;?

This didn&#039;t raise some, some alarms? This didn&#039;t concern you?

The use of lazy thinking and sloppy logic to &quot;prove&quot; that what a therapist today observed about eyes was somehow -- what? -- DIVINELY given to a Jewish prophet thousands of years ago -- this kind of thing doesn&#039;t worry you?

Like the Jewish prophet didn&#039;t just have a &quot;aha&quot; moment, a human moment, wrote it down, and by gum -- a scientist today had an identical &quot;aha&quot; moment?  

Does this mean ALL Talmudic cures still work?

Yeah, that&#039;s what I thought.

You should have called it out as crap thinking.  &quot;Ancient Chinese secret&quot; kind of stuff.  All cultures everywhere learned things by living and wrote some of it down and over time it is rediscovered (and sometimes DISPROVEN) in the sterile labs at the University of [fill in the blank.]

Recently our country &quot;rediscovered&quot; or &quot;discovered anew&quot; or &quot;learned from the Indians&quot; that quinoa is good for you.  DOES THIS MAKE EVERYTHING THE INDIANS SAID AND DID DIVINE?

Yeah, that&#039;s what I thought.

Kiruv crap thinking is the domain of some of the kindest, warmest, most caring kiruv rabbis.  Their heart are pure, but their heads are (at least in part) full of mush.

You didn&#039;t feel that was a mush idea?

We&#039;re not always the first generation to realize things -- go to any ancient culture and you will likely find they realized some things too.  And wrote some of it down. And we rediscover it, or look at it anew today -- the guys with the white coats start looking at yogis who can hold their breath for forty five minutes, etc.  And we find some of it works, and some doesn&#039;t.  And we learn from some of it, and we discard some of it.

NONE OF IT MEANS what the kiruv rabbi likes to say it means.

The Jewish future is dominated by self-deceiving, well intentioned outreach guys, doing magic tricks to try to save the Jewish future.

Why did you go along with it?]]></description>
