		<description><![CDATA[I see Rashi says like you about the burnt tum&#039;ah being from this oven.

Although to me the gemara itself (naive read) looks like the Rambam and the Ritva: They debated a hypothetical case, R&#039; Eliezer&#039;s Shamuti ruling came to the fore, and they lost confidence in *all* his rulings about taharah. So, they gathered up everything they found that he declared tahor and got rid of them. Presumably speaking about only things that require being ruled tahor -- terumah and other qodshim. There is no reason to burn most tamei objects. But anyway, the idea that it was a general condemnation of his rulings follows the next thing, they curse or at least excommunicate R&#039; Eliezer.

So, while I can&#039;t take sides against Rashi, there is still no indication anyone ruled it was okay (or prohibited) to use such ovens before the debate in the gemara. I would think this is the first time they tried to bring the question to resolution. Otherwise, it would take a vote of beis din to overrule a prior beis din (the Sanhedrin was in Yavneh at this time, no?) and R&#039; Eliezer would be a zaqein mamrei, not &quot;just&quot; in cheirem. There is nothing about someone doing something that implies a prior ruling. People sin by accident or by making wrong guesses about what&#039;s okay all the time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;First, the gemara doesn&#039;t say that, it raises the case in the hypothetical&quot;


It doesn&#039;t sound hypothetical to me. Sounds like they literally took the food they declared to be tamei and burned it THAT DAY.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;And if so, how do you know R&#039; Eliezer&#039;s rejected position of tahor was that prior ruling?&quot;


Because (IIRC) the gemara explicitly says that they had to destroy all the food cooked in it. If the position before was &quot;not tahor&quot;, why would anyone cook in it and run the risk of wasting all that food? Furthermore, didn&#039;t HKB&quot;H agree that it was correct to say it was tahor [before], and didn&#039;t chazal overrule that statement and say that it was now (and forever) to be considered tamei?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, thank you for your nuanced review of some of the ideas in my book Circle, Arrow, Spiral, Exploring Gender in Judaism. The truth is I am not advocating passively and resignedly waiting for things to improve--I think it is  up to us. But the big question is what do we want to change and how to go about it?

 In the reading of the Midrash presented in my book, the moon is protesting the unfairness of being ‘feminine’ in a world which values only typically masculine traits.   The rest of the Midrash is about G-d trying to convince her that her traits are the ones most beloved to Him. 

Interestingly, the moon is also a metaphor for the Jewish people. Women and the Jewish nation have the same mission: to bring the world closer to the ‘feminine’ way of being which include traits like interconnectedness, receptivity, mindfulness, process, interdependence, openness, fluidity, responsiveness, and relationality. 

   How does one bring the world closer to such ideas? It’s an important question—and  clearly one way is through encouraging dialogue, thinking, being receptive to others views, even while clarifying your own, etc.   In fact, writing this comment has gotten my juices flowing—thank  you Rabbi Fink! .  I think I am going to write a post on what I see as the Jewish women&#039;s agenda.  It will probably take a few days but you are welcome to visit my site  miriamkosman.com to read. (by the way, you can download the first few chapters of my book there as well.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am fully aware what antithetical means. Perhaps you are unware what idictment means. Indictment-
a thing that serves to illustrate that a system or situation is bad and deserves to be condemned.
So again, why would a religion be &quot;indicted&quot; if its belief system is antithetical to fair pay?

		<description><![CDATA[No it does not mean &quot;being opposed to so called &quot;fair pay&quot; is out of bounds.&quot; It means that saying fair pay is antithetical to religion is out of bounds.

&quot;Antithetical - directly opposed or contrasted; mutually incompatible.&quot; 
Say &quot;fair pay&quot; is incompatible with religion would be an indictment
of religion. So either you didn&#039;t know what antithetical means or you&#039;re just being annoying.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No I actually directly addressed your point. You said that if &quot;fair pay&quot; was antithetical to religion, that was an indictment of religion. Which means, that being opposed to so-called &quot;fair pay&quot; was so out of bounds, the position so ridiculous, that such a view &quot;indicts&quot; the religion. I pointed out the absurdity and close-mindedness of that argument and I did not mention the word &quot;lib.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;But to imply that voting rights for women and equal pay and fair treatment are antithetical to religion, is a much greater indictment of religion than society&quot;
Yes, because if a religion believes that all men, women, blacks, whites and Hispanics should be free to contract with their employers/employees as they so choose, clearly that&#039;s an indictment of religion. If you want to cling to your progressive &quot;equal pay&quot; nonsense you&#039;re entitled, but to then insist that if any person or religion disagrees, that&#039;s an indictment on that religion, is quite close-minded of you.&lt;/i&gt;



This comment makes no sense.


I said if X is antithetical to religion it is an indictment of religion. Then you said something, something, libs, something as if I had said a completely different thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re thinking of R&#039; Yonasan (Sanhedrin 71a), who also was the sole member of chazal to have seen the remains of an ir hanidachas, the others saying it never happened. It is possible he had a special interest in such things and hunted them out.


However, a number of rishonim note that R&#039; Yonasan was a kohein (Rashi concludes this from BM 91a) and therefore it would be odd for him to go sit on the grave of a ben soreir umoreh. (And in general, sitting on a grave just &quot;isn&#039;t done&quot;.) So it&#039;s usually taken to be hyperbole (guzma). And once it&#039;s established R&#039; Yonasan was exaggerating (even though one exaggeration doesn&#039;t necessitate the other), that grave becomes that of someone who was guilty as a ben sorer umoreh, not killed as one. Rabbi Schwab suggests the boy died as a ben soreir umoreh not by human court, but by the heavenly one. As it says in Sanhedrin 37b, G-d punishes those who get exempt in beis din on technical grounds.

But in any case, my beliefs follow the majority, not the opinion of one (daas yachid). (Even if many hadn&#039;t explained it away.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Tanur shel Achnai is a kind of oven that is made of disconnected pieces. The question is: if someone&#039;s tanur became tamei, and then they take it apart and put it back together again using sand rather than something sticky between the pieces, is it now tahor? Is this considered making a new utensil, because it&#039;s a usable oven, or does the fact that the pieces were not reconnected into one whole mean it&#039;s not a new utensil.
Really, how often did this come up that you think there had to have been a pre-existing ruling? And if so, how do you know R&#039; Eliezer&#039;s rejected position of tahor was that prior ruling?

If they made the mizbeiach in a new way for practicality, I would agree with your point about the mizbeiach. But no -- they said the old way of doing libations was not valid, even while they knew it was the way libations were done throughout the First Temple period.

The question is: if someone&#8217;s tanur became tamei, and then they take it apart and put it back together again using sand rather than something sticky between the pieces, is it now tahor? Is this considered making a new utensil, because it&#8217;s a usable oven, or does the fact that the pieces were not reconnected into one whole mean it&#8217;s not a new utensil.<br />
Really, how often did this come up that you think there had to have been a pre-existing ruling? And if so, how do you know R&#8217; Eliezer&#8217;s rejected position of tahor was that prior ruling?</p>
<p>If they made the mizbeiach in a new way for practicality, I would agree with your point about the mizbeiach. But no &#8212; they said the old way of doing libations was not valid, even while they knew it was the way libations were done throughout the First Temple period. (Finding a new, better, way doesn&#8217;t necessitate prohibiting the old.) The Great Assembly consciously changed the law either way, though.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I didn&#039;t say halakhah never changed, and in fact the next sentence gives an example of change.&quot;

Ah, then I misunderstood you. If we agree that halacha can change over time then what&#039;s your machloket with R&#039; Fink?

&quot;BTW, the Tanur shel Achanai story isn&#039;t about change of existing law, it&#039;s about how new law is decided.&quot;

How is that possible? The food from the tanur existed and presumably was eaten the day and week before, then the law changed and it was destroyed because it couldn&#039;t be eaten.

&quot;it would therefore not have been usable, as it didn&#039;t have the requisite holes (shisin).&quot;

Probably an example of the law changing for practicality. Previously the liquids didn&#039;t have anywhere to go and probably just ended up making a big mess, so they had to come up with a solution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t say halakhah never changed, and in fact the next sentence gives an example of change. I said that I take chazal at their word that  ben soreir umoreh was always defined in a manner that made it inapplicable in practice, and punishing Shabbos violators always requires witnesses, warning, acknowledging the warning, and everything else that made capital punishment rare. That the two halakhos specific you alluded to never changed. And then added that Sanhedrin, through self-exile, did effect a change from capital punishments being rare to them being non-existent.

BTW, the Tanur shel Achanai story isn&#039;t about change of existing law, it&#039;s about how new law is decided. An interesting example of change in existing law is the differences between the mizbeiach (the main outer altar) in each of the Two Temples. In Solomon&#039;s Temple, libations were made alongside the mizbeiach. In the Second Temple, they were poured through holes in it. The issue was a difference in the definition of the libation ending up &quot;under&#039; the mizbeiach, with the Men of the Great Assembly overturning the earlier ruling and requiring the wine and water poured literally into the ground under it, rather than the ground at its foot. And if they would have found Solomon&#039;s altar during the Second Temple period, it would therefore not have been usable, as it didn&#039;t have the requisite holes (shisin).

See also Mishnah Edios 1:4-5, and Rambam Mamrim 2:1-3.]]></description>

Yes, because if a religion believes that all men, women, blacks, whites and Hispanics should be free to contract with their employers/employees as they so choose, clearly that&#039;s an indictment of religion. If you want to cling to your progressive &quot;equal pay&quot; nonsense you&#039;re entitled, but to then insist that if any person or religion disagrees, that&#039;s an indictment on that religion, is quite close-minded of you.]]></description>

I think he said earlier that as long as there is progress (i.e. that religion tends to change towards more moral (as defined colloquially) rather than towards less moral), he will be satisfied.

&lt;i&gt;So, for example, you trot out the Tanur Achnai story, which is about how to pasqen given the qelalei pesaq (halachic process) rather than looking to more revelation. It&#039;s not about responding to the enlightenment of the outside world and dragging one&#039;s religion along.&lt;/i&gt;



That&#039;s NOT why I brought it up! I brought it up to refute your statement about halacha never changing (&quot;... was always that way ...&quot;). HKB&quot;H created Torah and halacha, and this is an example of chazal changing the halacha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think some of what you&#039;re calling changes requires not taking Chazal at their word that the halakhah was always that way. If so, we don&#039;t share givens.

But your second example still touches on a real change -- the Sanhedrin exiling itself from its meeting room in the Temple so as to make capital punishment a moot set of laws.

I see a difference between people whose culture is the religion, and therefore the religion evolves as the realia do, and someone who gets his values from the surrounding culture, and &quot;demand that religion keep up&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It would seem one could spin any narrative, and while the frum feminists are careful to create one of equality, it would be just as easy to provide evidence for a superior female role.  For example, we know that Avram became Avraham with the addition of the heh representing an addition of the divine breath to his name which enabled him to fulfill his divine destiny.  One could say that Isha was destined to be greater than the ish, as the yud, the hand of action was replaced with the heh, the window to wisdom.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Religion, of all brands, by nature cannot be like science, changing daily.  There has to be deep roots that provide stability, so the branches can sprout and grow.  How do we retain the positive aspects while pruning the negative ones?  I&#039;m not willing to, &quot;take one for the team,&quot; although in reality, the greatest contribution I could have made to Judaism (too late now thankfully) would have been to pop out kids Duggar style and raise them all to be good Jews and do likewise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HH, don&#039;t expect a response to your inquiry so soon. However, I am certain that in his heart, the Fink values &quot;Equality&quot; over Judaism, Tradition, Torah or Halachah.
In another year or two, he will be frankly affirming his holding that religion stands in the way of progress. He will still have the nerve to claim to be Orthodox, of course.]]></description>
