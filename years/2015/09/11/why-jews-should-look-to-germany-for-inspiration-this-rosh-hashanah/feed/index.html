		<description><![CDATA[i couldn&#039;t disagree with you more.  Torah b&#039;Goyim ahl tamin. Germans have nothing, and can never have anything, to teach Jews about ethics and morality. 


I am utterly unimpressed with the German response.  I don&#039;t think the refugees are innocent. כל המתאכזר על הרחמנים סופו להיות רחמן על האכזרים. 
95% of the adults among these &quot;innocents&quot; would gladly slit any Jewish throat that they could find from ear to ear if they thought that they could get away with it. 100% of them would thank Allah extravagantly if Israel were wiped off the map.  For decades Arab propagandists have been claiming that the Palestinians (losing there land etc.) should not be made to suffer for the sins of Germany in WW II. I say that Germany cannot atone for it&#039;s sins to innocent Jews by kindnesses rendered to fierce Islamofascist Arabs.  Jews lived benign lives in Gemany for a millennium and did nothing but improve and enhance German civilization.  Within 20 years these &quot;innocent refugees&quot; will utterly destroy the host society from withing.  they will make the lives of contemporary German Jewry a living hell much sooner than that.]]></description>
