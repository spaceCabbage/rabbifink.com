		<description><![CDATA[Indeed. There is much to learn in both directions. I&#039;m glad you said it because I certainly intended for that to be conveyed in this essay. If I wasn&#039;t clear enough, I apologize. I&#039;ve said it clearly in other contexts on this site.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I notice there are no comments, and hope others who are subscribed will comment.  One concept that is missing in this essay, and perhaps purposefully to avoid offending the Orthodox audience, is that non-Orthodox Jews, and secular, unaffiliated Jews have something to offer their Orthodox brethren.  Who would want to knowingly be in a relationship where the other party views you as deficient, inferior, holding to dangerous ideas that only those properly trained to reject and deflect are considered capable of having these interactions? Orthodox leaders and individuals are involved in interfaith efforts, but if someone views the population of Jewishly diverse as if they were from Mars, non-Jews must be outside this solar system. R&#039; Fink mentioned that the non-observant Jew just might want a friend.  Kiruv, as well as any brand of missionary activity, is dishonest in taking advantage of the natural desire for human connection, understanding and acceptance.  When I visit a car dealership and the salesman acts like my best friend, I am aware of his purpose, but when a religious figure invites me for dinner at his lovely home, introduces me to his warm, hospitable family, things are not so clear, especially for a person who is young and inexperienced, lonely, fearful, etc.  My personal take on the world of Orthodox Judaism from an outsider:  I love the wisdom and scholarship, since learning is something I prize, perhaps obsessively.  I enjoy the music and aspects of observance.  But I do not find the lifestyle of conformity attractive (including thought conformity) especially the role expected of women.]]></description>
