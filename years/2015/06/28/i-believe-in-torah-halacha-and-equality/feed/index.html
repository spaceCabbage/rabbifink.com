		<description><![CDATA[you can have a scenario where someone really wants something and they just can&#039;t have it. If someone really really wanted to kill, is it discrimination to say they can&#039;t? Are jailed murderers being discriminated against? They really wanna do it? Same thing with Gay marriage... So you want to... So? You may not. It is a straight up Pasuk. You may not. That&#039;s it! Lol Discrimination... What discrimination? ]]></description>

ויבא שאול עד עיר עמלק וירב בנחל 

אמר ר&#039; מני: 
על עסקי נחל, בשעה שאמר הקב&quot;ה לשאול: לך והכית את עמלק!
אמר: השתא ומה על נפש אחד מישראל אמרה תורה הבא עגלה ערופה בנחל, כל הנפשות האלו כלן על אחת כמה וכמה. 
אם אדם חטא בהמה מה חטאה, אם גדולים חטאו קטנים מה חטאו?! 
יצתה בת קול ואמרה לו: אל תהי צדיק הרבה. 
ובשעה שאמר לדואג: סוב פגע בכהנים, יצתה בת קול ואמרה לו: אל תרשע הרבה.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is just another example of putting subjective feelings before objective ideals. G-d is against homosexuality. Though He doesn&#039;t say to hate those who practice it, He still calls it to&#039;eva. Deal with it. G-d is merciful and compassionate, and, as a rabbi, I&#039;m sure you know that. So if He still says to kill Amalek, or not let agunas remarry without a get, or not let divorcees marry kohanim, or to kill every Philistine soul from ancient Canaan - we can either put our own subjective feelings forward and not comply, or we can understand that He must have a good reason for saying what He did. IOW, G-d calls it &quot;to&#039;eiva&quot; anyway. To publicize your &quot;celebration of the Supreme Court&#039;s ruling&quot; is celebrating your own feelings way more than His ideals.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your response is important, but even more important for the discussion about tax policy.  Yes, that boring glass one&#039;s eyes over topic of tax policy.  To be certain, I think that taxes should be collected to pay the federal (and in other cases, state and local) expenditures.  It should not be used for setting policy because things get confused and obfuscated.  Stated differently, if the mechanism of collecting (or not collecting taxes) is causing Americans to be concerned about a public policy that is otherwise moral, the tax collection system must be changed. The tax collection system was designed more than a century ago and is clearly outdated.  Because of technological advancements, we can collect taxes much more easily and differently than what was possible back then.  Maybe if we consolidate the individual tax returns into one return (with a Federal, State and Local line item on the bottom) and replaced the Corporate Tax code with a Business Receipts tax code based upon money collected (not sales), those like you wouldn&#039;t feel so concerned about a decision which seeks to spread more equality of opportunity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A distinction can always be made, but in this case it undermines your original argument since someone with your intelligence could surely come up with distinctions between gay and heterosexual marriage as well that could serve as a reason to be opposed to legalization. Instead you choose to follow your feelings and come up with a rational for enthusiastically supporting the decision for gay marriage. It seems that your conclusion is framing your argument rather than vice versa.

When it came to the shabbos light switch you correctly put forth that all halachic opinions should be grounded and supported Halacha, I find it odd that you abandoned that standard in putting this article together. I think your heart is in the right place but your efforts should be focused in finding a halachic justification for it.

Do you really have doubts that the Torah would not support the idea of society acceptance of gay marriage or are you writing it off as not as important as correcting the historical persecution of gays? (It is interesting that the symbol used to support this agenda is a rainbow given what the rainbow represents in the bible.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It isn&#039;t written anywhere. Maybe it&#039;s a midrash, who knows. Homosexuality is not against the Torah. Man-on-man sex is, technically. A person can&#039;t help if he or she is wired to be attracted to members of the same sex. I&#039;m pretty sure the rabbis in the Talmud recognize as much. 

What one does in the bedroom isn&#039;t our business, and people aren&#039;t meant to be alone. As an orthodox Jew, I don&#039;t believe that it&#039;s for us to dictate what goes on between consenting adults. No, not caring about whether gay people can be together won&#039;t lead to an amoral society. Other things will, so focus on those issues if you want to make a better world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HH,
As always, don&#039;t expect a substantive response from the ex-orthodox, now non-orthodox, rabbi.
I, however will tell you his true answer:  . . .     &quot;My coreligionists should not be bigoted. Unfortunately, they are still many orthodox Jews who are bigots, but change does come, sooner or later, PTL! In my reasoned view, which reasoning is in line with the methodologies of the great rabbis throughout history, Judaism does not treat gays or any humans as unequal just because of the way that G-d (sic) created them. All people, even you and I and Rashi and Rabbi Akiva and Moses, have struggles in our lives. Judaism has compassion for the gays&#039; struggles that have been foisted upon them by their creator or whatever. We should always celebrate when wronged humans are afforded equality in our progressing-toward-perfection society!  Lovingly, Eli.&quot;
Hope this helps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Before the word marriage was defined by the Supreme Court to include SSM, there was no discrimination.  Religious institutions could offer the exact same marriage ceremony/service to everyone regardless of orientation becuase by definition that marriage ceremony/service was between a man and a woman.  They were treating everyone equally.


The purpose of the millenia is to enforce the fact that the concept of marriage prior to the 1990s did not include SSM.  The word simply meant something else. 


Let me use an analogy. A mother has cooked supper for her 10 children, beef stew. One of the children cries, &quot;but Mother, I detest beef stew, it makes me nauseous. Please make me pizza.&quot;  The Mother says &quot;I have made supper, you can choose to eat it or you can choose not to eat it.  I am not making a different meal just for you, this is your supper take it, or leave it.&quot;  Does the child have a claim for discrimination?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is what I was hoping to read but wasn&#039;t written. If this is a civil rights issue, well than, ought we all treat it like all civiil rights? Let&#039;s use a real example: A while back a white preacher in Tennessee refused to marry an inter-mixed couple. Now, he didn&#039;t mean it should be ILLEGAL, but that HE doesn&#039;t&#039; want to marry them. Nobody demanded he be arrested, but he himself was vilified all over the internet. Enter gay marriage. While race has no internal connection to religion with issue of marriage, homosexuality certainly does. So my question is, if this particular preacher was vilified as an individual for his MORAL  (not legal) choice not to marry people that go against his conscience, what is going to happen when religious people are going to be vilified for their religious practice as a whole that denies gay marriage in general? This discussion is not going to end with the legal battle being won. It&#039;s clearly going to spill over into whether religious people are being unethical or not (just like this preacher). If Rabbi Fink thinks this is a &#039;just&#039; decision, than why ought religion not be &#039;just&#039;? 


How is Rabbi Fink going to defend his fellow co-religiongists from the accusations that they are practicing a bigoted religion? That their religion is &#039;unjust.&#039; If this preacher was declared a bigot for his personal opinions, why aren&#039;t all orthodox Jews bigots? It&#039;s on thing to be happy about the legal decision, it is quite different in dealing with the social consequences that will follow.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Snowbird, my dear, one would much rather live in a realm where one&#039;s subjects are treasured one and all, and where one&#039;s religious freedom is respected to the extent that one does not use this freedom to defecate on the rights, liberty and dignity of one&#039;s fellow subjects. Treating one&#039;s neighbour as one&#039;s self is not tyranny, it&#039;s theology.

		<description><![CDATA[Discriminating against one&#039;s gay subjects was always discrimination, it simply had not yet been recognized as such. One struggles to find sympathy for taxpayer subsidies for those who discriminate. One also struggles to find integrity in the argument that interracial marriage achieves a distinction on the basis of &#039;millenia&#039;. Slavery, marital rape, and much else that one finds displeasing were also stalwarts of the millenia. One suspects, Creamsicle, that you want to have one&#039;s cake and eat it; to claim that one is not a bigot while continuing to espouse bigotry, hiding rather cowardly behind &#039;religious freedom&#039;, &#039;actions&#039; and &#039;millenia&#039;. Creamsicle, this is not cricket! One must choose between treating all one&#039;s subjects equally, or confessing that one rather finds some subjects to be second rate in rights and dignity and that one is a bigot!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a superb post. One critique- I think you&#039;d have a stronger argument using polygamy to make your point instead of incest. As Rabbi Fink pointed out, one can certainly make a coherent argument why it&#039;s in the interest of the government not to recognize incestuous marriage. Polygamous marriage, on the other hand, as the Chief Justice pointed out, is  nearly impossible to distinguish with gay marriage. (As an example of how hard it is to come up with a real distinction: Judge Posner- usually quite a bright fellow- argued that polygamous marriage is different because if we allowed it we&#039;d run out of women!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is exactly the problem. Once the Supreme Court &quot;discovers&quot; a fundamental right to change the definition of marriage, what had previously been an adherence to, and a practice of, a religious precept consistent with American law, turns into discrimination.


On Thursday, these religious institutions weren&#039;t discriminating. Now, because of the Supreme Court&#039;s change of the definition of marriage, they are discriminating and are in danger of losing their tax-exempt status.


In the case of interracial marriage, marriage for millenia prior to the late 17th century did not have a racial component as part of its definition.  It was an innovation on the part of (some of) the American colonies to forbid interracial marriage and even those laws did not define marriage as &quot;the union between a man and a woman of the same race&quot; but rather, prohibited interracial marriage (thereby tacitly acknowleging that these were marriages).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This response is meaningful and though I disagree with its thrust, I am happy to see you respond to the questions - it is quite a relief. (As an aside, since you know who I am, you know any &quot;forceful-ness&quot; was not aimed ad hominem but at the issues being discussed.)

The question of how we formulate our (moral) worldview out of halakhic texts and at the same time create new ethical and legal structures, sometimes (I agree) bending the texts, is an interesting one and I am glad you touched on it. The great thinkers of the past century have wrestled with this question, and I agree with you that we are tasked with formulating new trails- but until now I did not see on your blog any substantive grappling with the existing pre-modern sources. Without the decision to first look to those texts, we are not engaging in halakhic Judaism. In short, if you had led with this, you probably would get much less flak (not that you are necessarily looking to avoid flak).

We can continue this discussion, perhaps, in person - as I have plenty to say to your thoughtful response, and will be on a plane in a matter of hours towards California. For the sake of the online discussion, though, I think you are showing your hand when you say &quot;Banning incestuous marriage does not harm or limit or discriminate against a large class of people who are doing nothing wrong.&quot; You are implying that active homosexuals are doing nothing wrong (let&#039;s face it, no one thinks we are talking about sexually inactive gays wanting to be married in sexless marriages). Again, as a rabbi, when you say this, you place yourself outside the halakhic circle, whose tradition has some very forceful things to say about this (I imagine you would never say that a Jew who purposely eats pork is doing nothing wrong). You may want to do that; but your choice is not lost on your readers. 


Furthermore, your arguments against incest are weak - certainly a brother and sister could find themselves in a loving relationship, and the fact is that it does take an objective (or at least subjective but firm) moral/ethical voice to explain why it should be forbidden and illegal.

As for point 2, reading the passage outside the context of staunchly anti-active-homosexual milieu is naive or dishonest (take your pick). You know well that the attitude towards gay marriage evinced in it is entirely in step with the general view of active homosexuality in society in the Talmud. It would be a very creative reading indeed that would succeed in bifurcating between sex acts and marriage, saying, &quot;yes, 100% of Chazal held homosexual intercourse an abomination, but they would all be open to homosexual &lt;b&gt;marriage&lt;/b&gt; and it is just one weirdo who wrote that passage&quot;.

To clarify, I am extremely compassionate (I think you know I am) towards homosexuals in orthodoxy, and am willing and motivated to find them halakhic solutions. But the idea that the (metaphorically) violent redefinition of &quot;marriage&quot; to include man+man would be a supported change by halakhic tradition is very difficult to defend, unless you break ties with halakhic literature throughout the ages - something I doubt you can do while maintaining the title of &quot;orthodox rabbi&quot;. Sometimes, the limits of a system&#039;s flexibility can be reached, modern day sensibilities notwithstanding.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your thoughtful and forceful comments.

I literally wrote this short essay to answer these questions by providing a competing set of values and opting for the set of values that was more compassionate. I don&#039;t deny the values you cite. They are authentically Jewish, but I would so prefer not to be stuck with those values. So I sought other Jewish values that are authentically Jewish which would support my preferred position. 

This is an authentic Jewish approach to socio-religious questions. All the poskim and religious thinkers throughout Jewish history have done the same thing. I am not saying I am on par with the great ones, I am just trying to do what they did. In that sense, I believe I have grounded my opinions in traditional Jewish thought.

I will entertain your questions anyway, because they are interesting, and because I can see your email address and I really like you.

1. There are several tremendous distinctions between gay marriage and incestuous marriage. For one, there are no people, as far as I know, who cannot love non-siblings. Banning incestuous marriage does not harm or limit or discriminate against a large class of people who are doing nothing wrong. Further, incest is most often a form of abuse. There is a reason to discourage incest that has nothing to do with religion or bigotry. If incest is not discouraged, we might be encouraging harmful relationships. Finally, it&#039;s too easy to misrepresent the an incestuous marriage. With no courtship, no newness, no new commitment to each other, the marriage offers very little in terms of new commitment and even when there is new commitment, it&#039;s too easy to make a sham of it. Marriage is a massive commitment. Committing to you own flesh and blood is hardly similar to marriage between non-blood relatives.

However, if there was a way to deal with my concerns and grant marriage benefits to incestuous couples, I would have no inherent objections. Yet, I would not celebrate. The reason I would not celebrate is because there is no social wrong that is being righted. We don&#039;t owe them anything.

But we do owe the gay community a lot. They have been hated, hurt, broken, beaten, demonized, and disrespected. When gay people are treated equally, under the law, that is certainly a moment for celebration. A wrong is being righted. Just because they are sinners in the view of the Torah, does not mean that they are not people who deserve fair and equal treatment.

2. We both know that this is a poor challenge. One can find divrei Chazal to support tons of positions, mainstream and obscure. The polemic statement in Chullin is clearly meant to teach a lesson, and I don’t doubt that one acceptable lesson is something along the lines of the message you have taken from the excerpt.

I find the entire passage odd. There is no way to take it literally, as the entire world does not, and did not follow even these three commandments they voluntarily accepted. Further, the implication of the passage is not that these are the most important things in the world. Yet further, the implication of the fact that this obscure, oblique reference is the most damning statement of Chazal on this subject says more by omission than by explication. If we were collecting modern divrei “Chazal” of rabbinic figures and their statements from 2000-2015, gay marriage would be like the most common thing in the anthology. 800 years of Babylonian Talmud and you get this one thing. Seems like this was not a huge thing for them.

My point is that overemphasizing any one passage from Chazal is somewhat disingenuous, at best. We all use a different cocktail of rabbinic statements to form our world view. This statement is in the back corner of the bartender’s cupboard.

I hope you feel I’ve addressed your substantive points. I am not sure how much time I will have to follow up if you have additional questions, but you know where to find me and we can continue this conversation any time you like. All the best.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To read opening sentences of your post, you certainly seem to view yourself as a martyr for equality. It is not common for a martyr to jump off his cross to reconsider his position, and so this is probably a waste of time, judging by your responses to substantive critiques on this blog in the past years, Eli, but I am willing to see if you can respond thoughtfully to criticism of your viewpoint. 


Please understand, Eli, that what is perplexing in your posts is not that you are willing to simply live with the Supreme Court ruling. It is the celebratory attitude you have towards it - the happiness you claim in this decision. The persona you present on this blog is a rabbinic one. The semikha you were granted is of course not a right; it is a privilege that comes with responsibility. You are responsible to present an accurate and authentic picture of rabbinic thought. My point is, If you were posting here as Eli Fink instead of &lt;b&gt;Rabbi&lt;/b&gt; Eli Fink, I would not bother at all. Once you post as a rabbi, populism must be traded for honesty.


And unfortunately, your post smacks of populism and weakly considered sound-bites. While it is true that the secular concept of marriage in the US never matched the halakhic one (indeed, US law allowed a Kohen to marry a divorcee, or a mamzer to marry a Yisrael, contrary to Jewish law), and that the First Amendment will in all probability continue to protect clergy from performing unions forbidden by their religions, this does not take away from the negative attitude of Jewish thought since Sinai regarding homosexual activity and marriage. The Talmud (Hulin 92a) states that despite disregarding their commandments, at least the non-Jewish world does not write marriage contracts for two men. It is this traditional opposition to homosexual marriage that is so hard to square with your exuberant support - all the while claiming (by your very title &quot;Rabbi&quot;!) to represent that very tradition honestly.


Our texts are supposed to serve as the backdrop against which we articulate our positions. In this case, the categorical statements of Chazal against homosexual ketuba (ie, marriage), should be the starting point for a rabbi discussing the issue. The fact that you feel no need in all you have written to even recognize the sources in traditional Judaism and what they have to say about the topic, much less come to terms with them, is a serious deficiency in your thinking, and calls into serious question the sincerity of your stated fidelity to Torah and Halacha. I think this is what people mean when they say &quot;you call yourself a rabbi&quot; in a sarcastic tone - they are saying that a rabbi needs to ground his opinions (to the extent that he offers them &lt;b&gt;as a rabbi) in traditional Jewish thought, and even when he diverges from this, he needs to explain carefully why, and how he relates to the passages that oppose his viewpoint.


Saying you are &quot;for&quot; gay marriage, without dealing with the Jewish texts that are against it, is populist, because it hops on the bandwagon of a rainbowed Facebook, instead of dealing honestly and carefully with the real issue for you - being loyal to the texts and at the same time cheer-leading for something the texts see as a moral failure.


I encourage you to respond to two questions: 


1) It was nice to see your straw-man argument regarding marrying a bike or child, but will you, based on the same considerations you present for gay marriage, support the recognition of incestuous marriage?  The litmus test of your populism will be if you can articulate an honest, sincere, reason why incest is different morally from homosexuality, and why you would support one but not the other. Or perhaps you will be brutally honest to your allegiance to equality, and admit to support for polygamous and incestuous marriages as well.


2) How do you deal with the passage in Chulin 92a regarding male ketubot? Do you reject the passage? Do you deny the aggadta&#039;s binding power even on moral and ethical questions? Does your Judaism function without that passage? Or do you deny the very premise that a rabbi need look to the traditional Jewish sources and engage them honestly when formulating an opinion?&lt;/b&gt;]]></description>
