		<description><![CDATA[Shalom Honorable Excellency&#039;s  ,
                                                           after doing  research and investigation about the possible location the Ark of the Covenant is hidden , I am sure for 100%  that the location is Mount Sinai  also the real location to rebuild the Jewish temple architecturally described and prophesied in the Book Of Ezekiel.
 
Exodus Chapter 3 :12 And He said: &#039;Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
 
&#039; Ezekiel Chapter 20:40 For in My holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them, serve Me in the land; there will I accept them, and there will I require your heave-offerings, and the first of your gifts, with all your holy things.41 With your sweet savour will I accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations.42 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country which I lifted up My hand to give unto your fathers.43 And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein ye have polluted yourselves; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.44 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have wrought with you for My name&#039;s sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.&#039;
 
God of gods and Lord of lords mighty and awful Hashem The heaven is Thy throne , and the earth is Thy footstool Give us now faith,hope, love, wisdom and knowledge and make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah and put Your law in our inward parts, write it in our hearts forgive our iniquity, and our sin; and be our God LORD of hosts God of gods Lord of lords mighty and awful Hashem .

		<description><![CDATA[Not 100% What you write there is about the ease of fundamentalism. I am not saying that being open to the alternative necessarily makes 
you more likely to find the nuanced middle, and your earlier post 
appears to. My comment of an hour ago was about the ease of overemphasizing either side of the dialectic in favor of the other.

How do I know I balance them more correctly? We all think we have the right balance, between the insane fanatics and the heretics. I&#039;m not claiming anything different.

But this dispute will pull Tzohar and the DL community as a whole toward the left, making a population gap for positions between that and the chardalim.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The loser will be the middle ground. Such controversies -- natural or manufactured -- tend to polarize the positions.
