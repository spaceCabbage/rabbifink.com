		<description><![CDATA[Interesting post.   As someone who left observant conservative judaism (kosher home with two sets of dishes, regular synagogue attendance, some shomer shabbos practices but not full orthodox observance), I often wonder about my own motives, and the idea that they may have been primarily emotion-driven resonates with me.  My feeling that Jewish observance was a needless chore and something that put up a barrier between me and many of my peers outweighed any positive feelings I had about it, and although I had occasional spiritual stirrings through Jewish practice I more often found the religion to give me a heavy, suffocating feeling.  I also found the guilt that it engendered in me hard to bear -- I&#039;m a serious and often literal person, and I tended to agonize over whether I was sufficiently meeting my Jewish moral and religious obligations.  I&#039;m sure some of this is inseparable from my experiences of my particular synagogue and rabbi, my own family, etc.  At the same time, there are also emotional motivations that keep me from severing all ties with Judaism, which I&#039;m sure influence me in having married someone Jewish and now in sending my daughter to a religious Jewish preschool.  So I guess I &quot;wanted&quot; to leave and yet &quot;wanted&quot; to not leave completely.  And I find that fascinating too - the Jewish fear of completely losing Jewish identity, the contradictory voices saying &quot;I don&#039;t want this&quot; and yet &quot;I have to pass it on to my children.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;You should also recognize that for many, leaving orthodoxy is even more painful than staying. There is nothing pleasurable about disappointing your family and having to navigate your way into a new world that cannot relate to you or your experiences. It&#039;s not all about chasing material pleasure and doing what feels good.&lt;/i&gt;

Again, of course I recognize this. I&#039;ve been saying it for years. It&#039;s a tangential point to what is being discussed here. I don&#039;t mean that people leave because of what frum people call &quot;tyvah&quot; at all. I mean that the pain of staying, for whatever reason, whether it&#039;s emotional, intellectual, or otherwise, is the thing that pushes people out. Not that they leave to pursue pleasure.

&lt;i&gt;Instead of saying that each group experiences judaism differently, I&#039;d take judaism out of the equation and say each group is equally capable of making one of two decisions; 1) make convenient choices that make us feel good without intellect, or 2) work hard to feel good about things we intellectually agree with. Which lifestyle we bring along with either of those choices is an extraneous variable.&lt;/i&gt;



But in my view, 1 and 2 are the same thing. Just one is a more sophisticated and mature version of feeling good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey, thanks for reading and added thoughtful comments to the discussion.

&lt;i&gt;The neat box you suggest makes it seem as though it is the negative experiences within orthodoxy that would make someone leave, and not the religion itself. &lt;/i&gt;

Not really. It&#039;s all encompassing and it includes things inherent to the religion. It&#039;s really only a primitively binary distinction between what I&#039;m saying here and the idea which I&#039;ve rejected in the previous post, specifically, the notion that people leave because of their lack of belief in God or Torah m&#039;Sinai. It&#039;s just to say that we leave (or stay) because of experiences and not because of theology.

&lt;i&gt;What I hope to get out of replying to you is that you or others reading will recognize that there is more of a legitimacy to why people leave orthodox judaism than simply negative experiences. This makes both people who leave and people who don&#039;t to be very petty, and it hands all of the control over to the &quot;leaders&quot; who just have to figure out how to make our experiences more positive.&lt;/i&gt;


I agree with you. It&#039;s terribly condescending. I have written about this in the past and made my position on this very clear. Orthodox Judaism is not for everyone. My point here is that the thing that triggers the staying or the leaving is rarely theology.


&lt;i&gt;I don&#039;t think even religious people want to be made to feel that way.&lt;/i&gt;



Yep. They resist it more than anyone.]]></description>

There is nothing pleasurable about disappointing your family and having to navigate your way into a new world that cannot relate to you or your experiences. It&#039;s not all about chasing material pleasure and doing what feels good.


 I&#039;ll go back to your exercise example; just because you stopped going to the gym after a year simply because you couldn&#039;t find the pleasure in it doesn&#039;t mean that&#039;s what most people will do. Many people will do whatever they can to try to find the pleasure in it because they know their well being depends on it. A mature and strong individual will do what they believe even if it is difficult, and they will do it so zealously that there will be no sense in turning back. This goes for both people who stay orthodox and people who don&#039;t.

		<description><![CDATA[This is a very thoughtful piece. I have to disagree with something you wrote though. 

&quot;...almost everyone I’ve talked to fits into these neat boxes. People who leave had a negative experience that define their Judaism. People who stay loved their religious experience. The ones who leave want to avoid future pain and trauma.&quot;

As someone who has left, I can tell you that the reason I disagree is not simply because I&#039;m an outlier. I know many people who have left Orthodoxy and their positive experiences outweighed the bad, and they certainly didn&#039;t allow their negative experiences to define Judaism. Please bear with me while I bring in my point of view and you can tell me if I misunderstood you.

 The neat box you suggest makes it seem as though it is the negative experiences within orthodoxy that would make someone leave, and not the religion itself. In this equation, it is the negative experience that is the trigger. This is incredibly misleading because what I and many of my peers have experienced is that dysfunction is the solution, not the trigger.

We grow up hearing that people who leave religion do so for devious reasons or are misled intellectuals and often we witnessed them crawling back on their hands and knees to be reaccepted into the orthodox community. These memories and thoughts don&#039;t leave us even if we know they aren&#039;t true, even if we know we aren&#039;t deviants or any more misled than most orthodox people.  Without the negative experiences, there is too much at stake and there is no way to rationalize to yourself or others why you want to leave without being accused of being obsessed with material, physical pleasures. Negative experiences give at least an excuse. 

So yes, you probably see a high rate of negative experiences among people who leave orthodox judaism, but that says nothing about them except that their path to leaving was clearer. The &quot;disenfranchised&quot; people in the community who did not have negative experiences have a harder time leaving. Most of the time, they stay. And simply because they stay, and don&#039;t make alot of noise, they are simply ignored by your boxes that you have set up. But that doesn&#039;t mean they don&#039;t have the same criticism of the lifestyle, or that they aren&#039;t a sizable portion of the population, or that many of them have indeed left and just simply won&#039;t talk to you.



I agree with you that people are certainly more motivated to do what makes them feel good rather than what they intellectually believe. But wouldn&#039;t you agree that intellect is a driving force for a lot of what we are capable of enjoying? I know it is for me. If I don&#039;t intellectually agree on many of the tenets of orthodox judaism, I will have a hard time enjoying it whether my experiences were positive or negative. What I hope to get out of replying to you is that you or others reading will recognize that there is more of a legitimacy to why people leave orthodox judaism than simply negative experiences. This makes both people who leave and people who don&#039;t to be very petty, and it hands all of the control over to the &quot;leaders&quot; who just have to figure out how to make our experiences more positive.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; People do not do what they do because they think it’s true or right. People do what they do because it’s what they want to do. 
The definition of maturity is realizing your parents were right to make you eat your vegetables.
Your definition applies to people who grow into adulthood but fail to mature and, as adults, still don&#039;t eat their vegetables.
Successful, mature people eat their vegetables even if they would rather have cake because they know vegetables are healthy, know they want to be healthy and conclude that despite their lack of love for vegetables they simply have to eat them.
Look at the most successful people in the world.  Did they get there by doing only what felt good?  Or did they succeed because they faced the challenges they didn&#039;t want to deal with and overcome them?
Do I want to only eat kosher?  To paraphrase Rabbi Eliezer (as quoted by Rashi): what can I do?  This is what God wants me to do whether I like it or not.
Therefore we should be asking how to increase maturity in our adults instead of trying to make them feel good.]]></description>

I still find the apologetics that religious people put forward to be unbelievably self serving and show a lack of spine.

If I were (will be?) orthodox -- I would say, &quot;yeah, there is some ugly stuff in here.  Really disgusting.  Guess what?  I have a pretty disgusting mind in some ways.  Like everyone who actually follows their insane monotheistic religion.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, so we can better understand some of the points you mean to bring out with this article, would you read the following story and then answer the question at the bottom?

There was once a poor husband and father living in a remote area of India that believed that his family deserved more than the few slices of bread and tattered clothes that he was able to provide them with the meager equivalent of 25 dollars a week he was making. However, where he lived, there was no possible way for a simple villager to climb the ranks, and join one of the few wealthy families that owned all the industry in the area. Most of his friends knew life as it was and never dreamed of ever living any more comfortably. However, this man never said no to his dreams, and after many years, he finally saved up two thousand dollars that he planned to use for a ticket to america, where he heard he can make over twenty times as much as he was making at home. 

The man arrived in america, and, before long, he found a job paying ten dollars an hour. He felt like a rich man.

It didn&#039;t take long before he met a whole bunch of new friends who came to america from his homeland for similar reasons. However, the difference between him and his new friends was that his friends used their newly acquired wealth to live a life of their dreams, they saved up to buy cars, they rented their own nice apartments, they bought new clothes whenever they felt the need, and they still had money left for some beer and vacations; however, he slept in the cheapest bed he was able to find for the night, walked wherever he had to go, and only ate whatever he was able to find at the local soup-kitchen. However, he considered himself the happiest man earth because he knew that for every penny he doesn&#039;t spend, his wife and kids would have another nourishing meal or a set of warm clothes. He went on like this for years, he always watched his friends living a great life but he always knew that putting his week&#039;s pay in an envelope and addressing it to India gave him a better feeling than he could have ever had living the life of his friends.

One day, he meets an old friend from his village in India. the first question he asks is &quot;how is my family&quot;. The friend turns to him with a shocked face: &quot;you don&#039;t know what happened to your family?&quot; And the friend goes on to say how his whole family sadly died out from a terrible disease that struck the village shortly after he left to america.

It goes without saying that the man was devastated. He did his own research only to confirm that what his friend said was really true, and that the money he sent every week was just stolen by the neighbors.

        Rabbi Fink, I have a question for you. The man said that putting his week&#039;s pay in an envelope and addressing it to India gave him a better feeling than he could have ever had living the life of his friends. Do you think that, after he acquired the intellectual knowledge of his families fate, he would have still gotten that amazing feeling if he were to send his week&#039;s pay to India? Would you be surprised if (after recovering from the grief) he would make a sudden lifestyle change and try to use his money to live the most comfortable life he possibly can?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The temple is built in our image ... in other words, when the third temple will be built, it will be organized and operated as we choose (as the current rabbis choose) which will likely be very different than how the two previous temples operated. As proof, I simply present that the second temple operated differently than the first temple did.


For example, most korbanot will be able to be done via direct deposit. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure what an &quot;open atheist&quot; is? An atheist *doesn&#039;t do stuff*, and there are no specific visible things that are required to be done (like headcovering, going to church/shul/mosque, etc) by an atheist.


My point is that if someone asks &quot;what is your religion?&quot; and you say &quot;none&quot;, then they will simply accept that and that&#039;s it (or maybe ask &quot;what were you before?&quot;). And all forms that request religion also have a box marked &quot;none&quot;. That didn&#039;t exist in past generations when everyone was a member of a religion.


While it is true that the people probably wouldn&#039;t elect an atheist yet, the same was true about Jews and Catholics and Mormons not so long ago. It&#039;s (stated atheism) a relatively new thing and people take time to get used to new things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Many people do struggle with this, but their first instinct is not to question their faith.  They basically rationalize it with some version of &quot;God&#039;s ways are mysterious&quot; and that all will be revealed and clarified in some utopian world to come.


When you&#039;re an FFB or a longtime BT like I was, the last thing you&#039;ll do is question your faith.  Even when I had already questioned intently for a few years, the first time I picked up Kugel&#039;s book in the library, I touched it like it had a disease.  I put it back on the shelf and didn&#039;t go back for it for a couple of months.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In fact, when it comes to religion today, there is evidence for the opposite. When people leave religion, they tend towards secularism, not toward a different religion. This was not the case 100+ years ago where secularism hardly existed, you *had* to be a member of some religion. There are still a few places in the world where if asked &quot;what is your religion?&quot;, and you answer &quot;none&quot; or &quot;atheist&quot;, you are looked upon with great suspicion. But in most of the western world, being secular is well-accepted already.


As far as politics, it is likely that people who leave one political view, adopt other political views afterward.


And regarding social groups, well, that changes periodically as one ages anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have not heard much on the topic of how people reconcile their commitment to Judaism with their innate sense of moral decency. 



 Even if you believe in G-d, even if you believe G-d gave Torah, isn&#039;t the idea that &quot;gays should die,&quot; or people who happen to not believe lose their place in the world to come register as disgusting, unfair, despotic?


How come more Jews don&#039;t struggle with this and protest the G-d of the Torah they might even believe in?  Not be orthodox on principle and deal with it in the next life when they get to confront G-d on the matter?


Most Jews would forego a great meal in a great restaurant if they walked over with a black friend and it said &quot;no blacks allowed&quot; on a sign in the window.  They might love the food, and they&#039;re not black so it&#039;s not really their problem, but they wouldn&#039;t patronize the restaurant.  Moral integrity would not allow it.


How come people don&#039;t apply that same fairness yardstick to their religion?  It&#039;s got great food (ideas) but enough horrible ideas (like that pesky sign in the window) that we can&#039;t participate.


Is it just that we live in a &quot;go for your, f*&#038;k everybody else&quot; world? It&#039;s not my problem, it&#039;s yours (the gay, or the non-believer who is punished for &quot;bad&quot; thinking) - so if it works for me, I&#039;m doing it..?


Is there any other club besides our own Judaism we would tie ourselves in knots morally for?



Thanks, and I find this blog interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been butting heads on this topic with Yeshiva-world people since high school. It&#039;s very hard to convince people who consider themselves intelligent and true believers that the motivation for their belief is something other than intellectual. It&#039;s almost unfair to have these discussions with them, given how painful it is to them when they briefly see what you&#039;re getting at and then start grasping at straws, hoping the conversation ends as soon as possible.
I think the concepts &#039;inertia&#039; and &#039;convenience&#039; should be mentioned as part of the reason for the &#039;want&#039; here.
An interesting question, for those of us who do believe in G-d and Orthodox Judaism, but acknowledge and accept the premise of this post, is how all of this should affect our actions, especially with regard to the way our actions adversely impact the lives of others.

This comes up in real-life situations all the time:
1 - Charedim deciding that they don&#039;t need to contribute to the Israel military and economy
2- Israel Religious Zionists deciding that they can do Hesder instead of full military service
3 - A religious soldier davening while other soldiers are working
4 - A religious worker leaving early on Friday, which might be OK with the employer, but how about the other workers who are affected by this?
5 - Essentially forcing non-religious family members to pay for kosher affairs.
Etc.
And these are the relatively benign scenarios. I haven&#039;t even gotten into whether it makes sense to give some skila for Chilul Shabbat when I know that the motivation for my beliefs is ultimately my personal convenience. Etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, I think you would like the works of Dan Ariely.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;People do what they do because it’s what they want to do.&quot;


A bit of circularity here: people do what they want (to the extent they can). But that&#039;s kind of inherent in the word &quot;want&quot;. The question of why someone chooses to stay Orthodox or to leave, or someone else to become a ba&#039;al teshuvah, isn&#039;t about whether the central theme is want or something else, but about what causes want / desire. To what extent do people want to do what makes sense to them, in contrast to other motives?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People&#039;s motives are indeed complicated, and always a mixture of both conscious and non-conscious motives.

Rav Elya Lopian defined the Mussar Movement as a matter of carrying something a mere &lt;i&gt;ammah&lt;/i&gt; -- from the head to the heart. As we quote Moshe (as retold by G-d in Devarim 4:39) in Aleinu, &quot;וְיָדַעְתָּ הַיּוֹם וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ אֶל לְבָבֶךָ כִּי ה הוּא הָאֱלֹקים -- and you know today and will answer to your heart that Hashem is the [only] G-d...&quot; We know things now that still haven&#039;t made it into our hearts, where decisions are made.

We often do things we know are a bad idea (the problem the Greeks referred to as &quot;akrasia&quot;). Because our decisions are shaped far more by the gut, by emotion, desires, middos, than by reason. Of that mixture of motives, belief plays a very small role. As I wrote earlier this afternoon, it is more a symptom of our motives than a cause.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Is the number of people who leave Orthodoxy due largely to belief significant compared to the attrition due to other factors?

I think that people don&#039;t leave for any one reason, and it&#039;s very hard to tease out how much is from belief, how much from other factors, how much the beleifs influence the other factors, how mush the other factors influence beliefs/what a person is receptive to accepting as true, and how much various factors influence each other. A persons motivation is a complicated tangle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People believe what they find plausible. Even if they have logical proofs, those proofs rest on which givens (postulates) they find plausible. All of which means that people end up picking the belief system that fits their experiences, that works for them. To quote myself, &quot;The mind is a wonderful organ for justifying decisions the heart already reached.&quot;

Belief plays a role in one&#039;s motivation system, because once it fits our lives well enough to be compelling, the belief system informs the details. But the cycle doesn&#039;t begin with belief.

This is arguably the point the Kuzari makes in 1:13 (customized from Hirschfield, 1905):
&lt;i&gt;The Chaver: That which are describing is religion based on thought and systemic [reason], the research of thought, but open to many doubts. Now ask the philosophers, and thou wilt find that they do not agree on one action or one principle, since some doctrines can be established by arguments, which are only partially satisfactory, and still much less capable of being proved.&lt;/i&gt;

The Kuzari&#039;s alternative was to propose that tradition is a more certain justification for a belief than is philosophical proof. What I am proposing here is more modern, post Kant&#039;s Critique of Pure Reason. (Most beliefs are synthetic a priori, and those that aren&#039;t rest upon postulates which are.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re conflating two different points in this article. The first is that we do what we want. Obviously when we take an action it&#039;s the action we want to take - otherwise we wouldn&#039;t be taking it. It might be tremendously painful, but for one reason or another, we want to act. It&#039;s an important philosophical point (probably made by Spinoza) but very narrow in implications.

The other point is that information tends not to play a role in what we want. That&#039;s obviously not universally true: I might love Snapple and drink it every day (and even use it in my analogies) but if one day I learn that my Snapple was contaminated with cyanide, I won&#039;t drink the Snapple. That&#039;s highly generalizable. On the other hand in some cases (smoking is a good example) we won&#039;t act in accordance with our rational judgments, we&#039;d prefer to ignore those judgments and keep smoking. 

Vaccines by the way, illustrate a different point: It is tremendously hard to change deep seated belief. That could be relevant to your argument, but it doesn&#039;t make the same point as the previous one. Here the subjects beliefs remain the same, despite evidence that ought to have changed them.

How does this impact religion? You&#039;re right that religious people are likely to be tremendously attached to their religion, and it would take a lot to make them budge from it. (Conversely, religion - particularly Orthodoxy -has a lot of requirements and less attached people are unlikely to maintain them.) But there are also forces in the other direction. Cognitive dissonance is a big one. People want to walk the walk, if they believe something they want to act according to those beliefs and they will grow increasingly uncomfortable acting against them. (This from personal experience.) And, especially over time, this *can* overcome existing attachments. It is possible to want two different things and eventually one side wins.

Is the number of people who leave Orthodoxy due largely to belief significant compared to the attrition due to other factors? That I don&#039;t know. But it&#039;s worth considering that these might be the types of people a religion needs. Good leadership requires both devotion and the ability to change - that is, unusual susceptibility to changing beliefs and acting accordingly. Which might suggest that the effects of intellectual attrition are far greater than the simple numbers might suggest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;A small factor is belief.



What do you mean small? Beliefs are the trigger towards everything else. You went to a &quot;Summit&quot; did you not? Why? Well, it starts with some core beliefs and values you have.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; They REALLY believe their facts are right and their is a conspiracy against them. None of this comes from feelings.

To be fair, people really don&#039;t like changing their minds once they&#039;ve come to a conclusion on a subject. Changing the way you think about something, especially something big like the role of pharmaceuticals, is a lot of effort. So people will hang on as long as they can. Add to that the feelings of superiority that come with being in the know - one the primary attractions of conspiracy theories - and the built-in defense that anything that disproves the conspiracy is part of the conspiracy&#039;s cover up, and changing minds is almost impossible.

&#062;  how many orthoprax really stick around because they love the experience vs. other factors (such as family?)

I can only speak for myself, but I don&#039;t love the expireince of being Orthodox. And I don&#039;t dislike the experience. It&#039;s just what I&#039;m used to. I&#039;m largely indifferent to it. If I wasn&#039;t married to someone who can&#039;t shake the conviction that for her to act religiously different than the way she&#039;s used to is WRONG, then I probably wouldn&#039;t be frum. Not because I want to not be frum, but because it would be too much trouble to bother.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;There was no difference between parents who received data and persuasive materials demonstrating the importance and absolute safety of vaccines. People don’t change their minds based on data. They do what they want to do. What they want to do is usually based on the things that make them feel good. Not on facts and figures.&quot;

It makes them feel good? How? Most of these people simply don&#039;t believe in these facts or figures because it&#039;s either manipulated by the industry or what not. It&#039;s not that it makes them feel good. They REALLY believe their facts are right and their is a conspiracy against them. None of this comes from feelings.

This is a complex issue that doesn&#039;t just fall on the lap of feeling good.

Also, I think you are interpreting things through your own personal nature. You tend to be a more emotional man. Crying a lot and thinking about feelings. Nothing wrong with that of course, but it may cloud an objective assessment. I mean, how many orthoprax really stick around because they love the experience vs. other factors (such as family?) If it can be somehow proven to the Fink family (meaning you and your wife come to the same conclusion) that there is no God would you honestly practice &lt;em&gt;orthodox&lt;/em&gt; Judaism?

&quot;Or that heresy is dangerous because if one lacks orthodox beliefs, there’s no reason to be an Orthodox Jew. I think this is demonstrably false. &quot;

Out of curiosity, have you met many people that willingly want to remain orthoprax for the forceable future that don&#039;t have any sort of family issues?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think R&#039; Fink is also reducing the entire real of non-cerebral thought into &quot;want&quot;. People do what they do because it addresses a need. Yes, people want needs met; but then, people want to follow the truth too. Speaking in terms of want clouds the issue.

People think their religion is true for non-cerebral reasons. In the case of Orthodoxy, it&#039;s typically because they cannot fathom that what we experience when everything clicks and Shabbos really resonates, providing a feeling of quiet, centeredness, spirituality and commitment to growth. Or the way some topic in halachic analysis (some &lt;i&gt;sugya&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;i&gt;shas&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;lomdus&lt;/i&gt;) comes together from pieces from across halakhah. Or some other mitzvah experience.

It&#039;s like a mathematician saying a given math proof is beautiful. There are two things there: the assessment of beauty, and the properties of the proof that cause that assessment. The first, the aesthetic judgment, is more subjective than the latter, the structure of the proof -- because it is just that, an assessment or a judgment. Even if both are subjective in the sense that they cannot be held out and shared with others, the way empirical facts can.

I am saying that much of what keeps a person religious isn&#039;t liking Shabbos (to return to my original example) in and of itself as much as that part of the experience of Shabbos which we then like.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; I know more than a few atheists who are happily practicing Orthodox Judaism. The do not believe in God or Torah m’Sinai, yet they are devoutly Orthoprax

Hi

&#062; People do not do what they do because they think it’s true or right. People do what they do because it’s what they want to do. ...The thing that determines whether an adult will practice Orthodox Judaism is not what they believe. It is what they feel.

But I think you&#039;re selling intellectual conviction short. If a smoker is shown the consequences of his smoking, that knowledge may make him want to stop enough to actaully quit. For others, it won&#039;t. And for still others, he&#039;ll want to quit, but less than he wants to smoke, and so he&#039;ll smoke but feel terrible about it.

Motivation is a complex interplay of intellectual knowledge, emotion, what we&#039;re used to, and what&#039;s easier in the moment.]]></description>
