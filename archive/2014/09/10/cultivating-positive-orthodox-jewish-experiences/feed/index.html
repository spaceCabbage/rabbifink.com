Discussion with Moishela (with his family)

A Handicapped child

16 Elul 5774 (Sept 10, ‘14)

I Have Been Given Permission to Reveal to you Future Events

Oy Mommy, Oy Tatti, what can I tell you? I’m sorry that I have made you in the last few weeks a little bit unnerved, but I must admit that the world is changing at the speed of sound, and from day to day or from minute to minute, we don’t know what’s going to be. We used to live in a world that was at least semi organized. We could predict, sometimes anyway, what the next day or the next minute might bring. Today we are all confused, never knowing where another tragedy, Shelo Naida, another bang will come from. Tatti, Mommy, the next few weeks are going to be very, very frightening. The next few weeks will be full of changes that will make our heads spin, changes all over the world, frightening changes and also frightening happenings.

By the time we get to Rosh Hashana we are going to all be in a somber mood, a mood for Davening very hard, for begging Hashem to save us and declaring Him our King. So we must prepare ourselves not to be too blown away by the happenings of the near future and always remember the only way to steady ourselves and keep ourselves in a state that we can overcome spiritually and physically the times to come, is by holding on to Hakodosh Boruch Hu, so-to-speak, holding on to the rope, spiritual rope that connects us Am Yisroel to our Creator. So as I said, in the next few weeks until Rosh Hashana there will be amazing new news for all of us, for the whole world and there will be news that people will not understand. They will stand and wonder what in the world is going on, but as time goes on we will realize what the plan of the evil ones really is.

After Rosh Hashana during the Aseres Yimei Teshuva will be a time of gathering our strengths together and crying to Hashem like we have never cried before. By the time that Yom Kippur comes around, I’m afraid that our tears might have been spent already from worrying what’s going to be, and we will try to squeeze out a few more in order to try to save ourselves. By the time Succos comes we will be quite worn out for our efforts, and I believe that Succos, at least for a short time, will bring a semblance of balance, a semblance of joy in the Yom Tov, but Simchas Torah will bring us back to the cruel reality, and we will dance with the Torah with tears in our eyes. We will hold the Torah close to us so it can’t separate from us, so we won’t separate from it. We will dance and we will dance and we will beg Hashem through our dancing to always keep us close to Him, and we will keep the Torah close to us, and when Simchas Torah is over the real wars will begin.

Am Yisroel you know that there is something in my words. In the last two or three years you have seen such crazy tragic things happening. We know that the world has become an insane asylum and as Harav Dessler put it the people taking care of the inmates are the inmates themselves. So it’s a world of the mentally ill. There are some Jews which do try to separate themselves from the Sheker, from the lie and on those few Jews the world of the Geula Shelaima will be built by Hashem. We Am Yisroel must hold on and never let go.

We will go farther. After Succos, Simchas Torah the world will become so so different, so horribly different that it will be absolutely unrecognizable. The only thing we will recognize is our Kesher with Hashem. The only thing that will be real will be our Kesher with Hashem, His Torah, and His Mitzvos.

Am Yisroel, the ones in Chutz Laretz, the ones outside of Eretz Yisroel, pack your bags if you can. Pack your bags and come. Do so. It’s not an Aveirah. Coming to Eretz Yisroel is a great Zechus, but don’t come if you don’t really want to go higher in your Yiddishkeit. Don’t come just to save your lives, because it won’t work. You have to believe, believe that Hashem is Hakol Yachol. Ain Od Milvado. You have to believe it with all your heart and your soul. You have to believe that there is nothing greater than our Torah. You have to believe that Moshiach is going to come and there is going to be Techias Hameisim and you have to believe in every single one of the Yud Gimmel Ikrim. You must believe in that. That is your ticket to eternity. You must with all your heart and soul believe in it.

After Simchas Torah there is going to be a giant Birur and that Birur is going to be very hard, but it won’t be hard for those who understand the Truth, for those who cling to Hashem, for those who cling to the Truth. It won’t be hard. So please Am Yisroel please, please if you feel up to it, if you feel that you want to rise spiritually, come to Eretz Yisroel, not Medinas Yisroel, that’s going to fall very soon, but Eretz Yisroel, come to Eretz Yisroel, and even though it could be very difficult and even though you don’t know where you are going to live and even though you don’t know where your income will come from, still you are better off here than there if you truly want to be close to Hashem. If you truly want, for spiritual reasons to come close to Hakodosh Boruch Hu, to actually greet Moshiach Tzidkainu then come to Eretz Yisroel now. Anyone with Gashmiusdik ideas about the Geula, forget it. Stay where you are.

I also want to reiterate that every Jewish soul will be saved. Every Jewish soul that stood at Har Sinai and said Na’ase Venishma, we will do and we will say, every Jewish soul will be saved. Hashem will make sure that even if a Jew thinks he doesn’t accept Emes, in the end he will. Hashem will force him to accept Emes, and he will become a great believer, but he will suffer on the way, but those who are close already, those who believe with all their hearts and souls in Hakol Yachol, in Hakodosh Boruch Hu, in the Ribbono Shel Olam, they will not have difficulties almost at all. It might be frightening to see what’s happening, but they themselves will not suffer. So Am Yisroel, we are coming to Rosh Hashana. Please do Teshuva. Please do Teshuva now. Get your heads straight. Get your minds on the right things. Teach your children how to react when the terrible wars really start. They have started already, but the really bad part is soon to come. Teach your children how to hold on to Hashem. Teach your children what reality is, what the Geula Shelaima means, what the Bais Hamikdosh means, what the Korbanos mean. Teach them not to be afraid because Hashem is Hakol Yachol. He took us out of Mitzrayim, which was an amazing, amazing Ness, and He will take us out of this terrible, terrible Golus and bring us to the Geula Shelaima.

I want to tell you something else Mommy and Tatti. I love you all very much. I know how much you are doing for me and how you care for me. I know I sometimes make you both a bit upset with my moods. I go a bit crazy myself with the double life that I have been living. One part of my life, a little boy with little boy needs, and the other part of my life I am a greater person a much more adult person. So please I ask you Mechila for anything I have done to make it difficult for you and tell you how much I appreciate how you’ve taken care of me, and how I imagine you will continue to take care of me up to when Moshiach comes. At that time I won’t need your help anymore, Be’ezras Hashem. I know that very soon we are going to see the Truth. So don’t get discouraged and don’t get taken down. Just know that all of our troubles are going to disappear and really you shouldn’t be worried about all these things that are happening in the house, buying and selling apartments, taking care of me, and all the other grandchildren who have this problem, that problem, or the other problem, or my aunts and my uncles that have all kinds of problems. Just know that it’s almost over, almost over.

To Am Yisroel I want to tell you that when we come to Chanukah we are going to have very great spiritual happenings that will remind us of the Maccabim, that will remind us of our greatness, will remind us of our Bais Hamikdosh, even though we will be very frightened and we will be such a tiny little group surrounded by huge amounts of wild people with terrible weapons, but still our hearts will be full of joy because we will feel again what the Maccabim felt even though we will be terribly afraid. It will seem impossible to ever get out of that situation, but Hashem will help us and we will, and after that will come Asara B’teves and we will mourn like we never mourned before. We will cry and beg like we never did on Tisha B’av, beg and beg Hashem to rebuild our Bayis our Bais Hamikdosh, and not let the Goyim do the most outlandish thing of destroying the Dome of the Rock and instead building Chas Veshalom there a temple to the Avodah Zorah of their new Religion Chas Vesholom, Yemach Shemam Vezichram. That is their plan to build on top of Har Hamoriah, Har Habayis a temple to the Avodah Zorahs, the worst Avodah Zorahs.

Then we will come to Purim and we will beg Hashem to save us from Haman and we will have a Haman here, a Haman that we will have to be saved from and we will have to fight, fight our fears, beg Hashem to save us from this awful terrible horrific person and his armies and his police. We will have to beg very hard. Hashem will save us.

He will save us, and then will come Pesach and we will be a tattered bunch of tired people when we sit around the Seder table, with Matzoh and wine miraculously provided for us by Hashem and we will beg Hashem to save us. We will beg Hashem. We will beg Hashem to bring the Geula Shelaima. On Shvii Shel Pesach we will hear the Shofar. We will hear the Shofar and on Leil Haseder each house will see Eliyahu Hanavi, all the Jews that are Emesdik will see him and it will give us strength, but it still won’t be the time of redemption. I can’t go on farther than that to explain, but when we see Eliyahu Hanavi we will know that very soon this terribly long Golus will be over, and we will be finally free. From that moment on, there will be more and greater wars. There will be false prophets and false messiahs, but we will hold on to Hakodosh Boruch Hu and to the seed of Dovid Hamelech, to our Moshiach Tzidkainu, our true Moshiach. He will reveal himself and we Motzai Shviis will walk into the Bais Hamikdosh and be Makriv Korbonos and be happy and be dancing with the greatest joy ever felt in the whole world, even though around us two thirds of the world will have been destroyed, and very few Yidden and even fewer Goyim will survive.

I have been given permission to reveal to you these future events in order to give Am Yisroel strength and courage to get through these very difficult times. I beg Am Yisroel from the bottom of my heart to feel that every Jew is responsible for the other Jew. Every true Jew feels responsibility for another Jew, feels that he wants to do Chessed for another Jew. That’s how you know he’s really a Jew. I love Am Yisroel so much that just saying it makes me cry, and I beg you please make it easy on yourselves. Come back to Hashem. Take away the Gashmius which is so senseless, all the toys, all the adult stupid toys, all the videos, all the things that make us waste our time and instead put our efforts into growing spiritually. The best way to grow spiritually is when times are difficult. We don’t want times to be difficult, but we must use the future hard times to help us grow. Please let us put our hearts and our souls and our strength, into growing even though around us will be death and destruction. Please keep growing. Please keep coming closer and closer to Hakodosh Boruch Hu.

Q: Do we have to be afraid of the ISIS?

A: That group of murderers were created by the Reshoim to frighten the world. They have no real tangible strength. It’s all a farce and the Europeans definitely don’t want them around and probably will try to get rid of them as fast as possible. However they will go underground and they will cause destruction in the world because they as individuals can blow up hundreds of places in Europe, America, not only the Mideast. As an army they aren’t an army. They are just a group of vicious people. They are using the scare tactics of chopping peoples’ heads off, Lo Aleinu, or murdering them in other terrible ways to make people afraid, but don’t pay attention to them. It’s all not something real. Yes people are killed and they are very vicious, but they have no strength and Hashem will destroy them.

There is nothing to add right now. I’m giving you kind of a preview. Up to now we the autistics, have written many things and they’ve all come true, however, we never really gave a timeframe because people still had to schlep through many years without this kind of Chizuk. There was no point in giving a timeframe, because people would say, “Oh well we still have ten years, so let’s just party until then. We have time to do Teshuvah!” There’s no time now, so let’s do it now now, now!

There is one more thing I want to say. In the next near future the State of Israel, the Medina is going to crumble. It’s already crumbling from its own decadence. That is what’s going to happen IY”H. Very soon the chaos is going to rage here until the Goyim take over. Then Moshiach will take control from the Goyim and the Geula Shelaima will begin Be’ezras Hashem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The question is a very good one and should concern us all. My intuition tells me that the group that is moving away the quickest is the single adult population.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The question is a very good one and should concern us all. My intuition tells me that the group that is moving away the quickest is the single adult population. Changes in shuls and schools aren&#8217;t going to make much impact on them. We have to come to terms with the fact that there are often ten years away from home before marriage and a lot can happen in those ten years. Positive Jewish experiences, real community, quality learning opportunities are all needed to retain and recruit or we will lose tens of thousands.  This is where we need to invest.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;(for better or worse)&quot;


I think the problem is deep down we all know it is for the better.  But it means the end of Judaism or the Jewish People -- which feels sad and not desirable.


It&#039;s a very hard question.  But I do think that the values of Judaism are contrived, and the values of the Enlightenment are a no-brainer.  And it is sad and leaves me confused myself.  But I go where my gut tells me -- away from bad ideas presented as good, and towards good ideas that don&#039;t show a clear path to a good life, but for sure an honest life.  Tough stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think we live the same place (b/c I live right by the Happy Minyan) and the very thing you describe is one of the things I love about living here: you can have a shul you like, but still respect the folks in the next shul and even attend when you so desire. Your friends can be anywhere from not Jewish to totally Hareidi and everyone pretty much gets along.


However, I think that within each shul, you&#039;ve got a derech. The tone is set by the rav (or the mission statement or whatever that&#039;s going on at Happy Minyan). The teaching there has a particular flavor. It provides a certain focus, you get support from the kehilla if you want to grow, and so on. I think hashkafic unity is useful in a setting where you can always come and go.


I personally think that in a community like ours, each school is like those shuls. Each has a flavor, and because there are many schools (bli ayin hara), we can select which one is the hashkafa we want to raise our kids in. This unified hashkafa serves an important purpose, so long as other hashkafos aren&#039;t denigrated. In a community that does not have a variety of schools, everyone can and should be accommodated, but here, that&#039;s not what I&#039;m seeing.


What I am seeing is something R&#039; Fink said that I really have to agree with: some schools want a monopoly on educating your family. And when your kids need different things, they should definitely be allowed to attend separate schools with no guilt trips or negative consequences.]]></description>

&#062;I see no reason not to subject the frum world to the same scrutiny and criticism any other group gets.

Sorry. I don&#039;t swallow that. There are people that scrutinize, but it do it fairly and know where to be critical and when to praise. Your comment that &quot;O Jews want other Jews to observe because it validates their lifestyle choices,&quot; is simply cynicism plane and simple. It&#039;s for no other reason but to give another swift kick. It&#039;s like we all have those friends that always judge someone&#039;s intention negatively, all the time, no matter what. 

&#062;You yourself are incredibly cynical about &quot;American liberalism&quot;. What&#039;s the reason for that?

If you believe, overall, that the values that emanate from orthodox Judaism is wrong and destructive that is one thing. That isn&#039;t necessarily cynicism. There are plenty of bloggers that know how to scrutinize and criticize OJ and doesn&#039;t lead to cynicism. You happen to be reading a blog like that right now.



Anyways, I think we have said all that needs to be said about this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh definitely, a bad experience like mine isn&#039;t a reason to leave.  But combined with some other events, it was an opportunity to question.  Someone else might ask the same questions, search the same sources and actually be strengthened in their faith.  For me, the exploration led me to believe the Torah wasn&#039;t divine.  I fully agree that a bad experience, on its own, isn&#039;t a reason to reject Judaism.

Today, I&#039;m mostly mad at myself that I drank the koolaid in the first place.  I did believe it was a wonderful lifestyle full of caring people, and therefore I didn&#039;t question the theology enough.  Obviously I went to seminary and had chavrusas and so on, but when I had questions of faith I pushed them down.  So I&#039;m not really mad at the community, ultimately, I&#039;m mad at myself for being a sucker.  How&#039;s that for honesty?

Would my life be better or worse today if I&#039;d never become frum?  Who knows?  That&#039;s how I can sleep at night.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s cynical to recognize that human beings need validation.

No. It&#039;s cynical to imply that that is ALL human beings need and that is their driving force. [emphasis on imply]

&#062;How does that not make a person cynical?

Look, in the end, it&#039;s a choice. I know many many people that have gone through your crap in L.A. They are angry and I understand. But I also see that their anger and cynicism is focused on something particular, which is the lack of resources that private jewish schools have. Your cynicism just boils over toward everyone and you judge the whole orthodox existence through cynicism. 

&#062;It wasn&#039;t the bad experience itself that made me question, but the underlying lies (that I believed) that the community cares for its own. It doesn&#039;t.



Not at all? Not a shred of kav schut eh? Maybe you should move here!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nob-believing orthodox stay orthodox for one reason only - their wife and kids. If they were single, they would leave. There is nothing you can do to orthodoxy to change that, because none of the singles that leave have anything against it. As a number of commenters (myself included) have already noted, they are just indifferent to it. Or, if you want to get hung up on semantics, they might even LIKE it. But they don&#039;t like it enough to stay. And you are not going to get these types of singles &quot;liking&quot; orthodoxy BETTER than the alternative, because orthodoxy is simply not built for singles. It&#039;s built exclusively for families. And skeptics with families don&#039;t need appeals to the spirit of the law, or anything like that. (As worthy as that might be, in many cases.) It is kind of sad, but it is true. Orthodoxy is not built for singles.
Put it this way. If you&#039;re a single guy looking for a vehicle, would you prefer a small Corolla pretty much designed for singles, or a mini-van built for families, that&#039;s been tinkered with in an attempt to make it more palatable to singles? QED.
(I hasten to reiterate, I am speaking from the perspective of skeptics only, whose relationship with orthodoxy is already on the rocks. Clearly, we are not addressing the many singles and married already perfectly happy within orthodoxy.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it&#039;s cynical to recognize that human beings need validation.  Let&#039;s say you buy a house in Great Neck and you&#039;re very enthusiastic about your new neighborhood.  Your friend comes to check it out and is seriously considering moving there; stays with you for a few days to get the feel for the place, asks all sorts of questions.  Then he buys a house in Scarsdale and tells you how much better the amenities are, how his neighborhood is so much nicer than yours.  You&#039;re going to feel deflated.  But if he moves to Great Neck and tells you what a great choice it is, don&#039;t you feel validated?  And this is just a silly example.  If your religion is very, very important to you, of course you feel validated if someone else chooses it, and make excuses (&quot;what a loser!&quot;) if he doesn&#039;t.


And if you&#039;re talking about cynical, I&#039;ll explain how I became cynical.  I spent 25 years being frum believing (and being told) that the frum world cares about every frum child, yet when my kid had issues in yeshiva, suddenly the only options presented are a shadow (classroom babysitter), special-needs yeshiva that&#039;s totally unsuited to his needs, or public school.  And when I put him in public school, he&#039;s treated as a valued member of the class, his teachers recognize and appreciate his skills, and the administration treats the whole family with caring and respect.  Meanwhile, the child learns and thrives, and the frum community looks at him as an oddity at best and...  I don&#039;t know what at worst.  (Soooo happy that years later he&#039;s now taking honors classes in public high school.  I never looked back).  How does that not make a person cynical?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s cynical to recognize that human beings need validation.  Let&#8217;s say you buy a house in Great Neck and you&#8217;re very enthusiastic about your new neighborhood.  Your friend comes to check it out and is seriously considering moving there; stays with you for a few days to get the feel for the place, asks all sorts of questions.  Then he buys a house in Scarsdale and tells you how much better the amenities are, how his neighborhood is so much nicer than yours.  You&#8217;re going to feel deflated.  But if he moves to Great Neck and tells you what a great choice it is, don&#8217;t you feel validated?  And this is just a silly example.  If your religion is very, very important to you, of course you feel validated if someone else chooses it, and make excuses (&#8220;what a loser!&#8221;) if he doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re talking about cynical, I&#8217;ll explain how I became cynical.  I spent 25 years being frum believing (and being told) that the frum world cares about every frum child, yet when my kid had issues in yeshiva, suddenly the only options presented are a shadow (classroom babysitter), special-needs yeshiva that&#8217;s totally unsuited to his needs, or public school.  And when I put him in public school, he&#8217;s treated as a valued member of the class, his teachers recognize and appreciate his skills, and the administration treats the whole family with caring and respect.  Meanwhile, the child learns and thrives, and the frum community looks at him as an oddity at best and&#8230;  I don&#8217;t know what at worst.  (Soooo happy that years later he&#8217;s now taking honors classes in public high school.  I never looked back).  How does that not make a person cynical?  </p>

		<description><![CDATA[Why would you be trying to convince yourself? &quot;Because statements like this: the collapse of the non-halachic Jewish community is far from a foregone conclusion.&quot; seems like balderdash.

&#062;It&#039;s completely illogical for a believing Orthodox Jew to fear that the Jewish people will all intermarry &#038; disappear.


You hear that Nehemiah and Ezra?

&#062;In my opinion, O Jews want other Jews to observe because it validates their lifestyle choices. But I wanted to hear your opinion.

Well, you lean toward being a more cynical person, so I am not surprised you would make that generality, but that&#039;s just my opinion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To elaborate - as a very young person (brought up traditional but not Orthodox) I totally bought into the idea that only observance could preserve the Jewish people.  Yes, I drank the BT koolaid before I could get a driver&#039;s license in any state.  


Over time, I have seen that there are tremendously committed Jews who are not Orthodox.  Not only that, but I have Reform &#038; Conservative friends &#038; relatives who are way more enthusiastic about Judaism than I am, and than a whole lot of O Jews I know.  So I don&#039;t need convincing.  


Besides, as I argued with Harry Maryles a few weeks ago, O Jews believe in God&#039;s covenant not to forsake the Jewish people.  So O Jews already believe that the Jewish people will be preserved through divine means - no need to fear that the Jewish people will disappear.  The preservation of the Jewish people may be a problem for non-O Jews, who don&#039;t rely on God&#039;s preservation but on population trends; but O Jews can be confident that God is already taking care of it.  It&#039;s completely illogical for a believing Orthodox Jew to fear that the Jewish people will all intermarry &#038; disappear.

So what? Stick with what you asked. You asked &quot;Why aren&#039;t religious people satisfied with being religious themselves?&quot; I gave you the answer. You don&#039;t agree? Ok. But I believe that is the answer to why RELIGIOUS people care. 


&#062;I chuckle to see that you&#039;ve defined the &quot;middle ground&quot; right around yourself, just like the Centrist himself, Harry Maryles.



How can you chuckle when I gave no indication where my ground is? And that middle ground maybe incredibly broad too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a whole Jewish community that is very strong despite not observing halacha, so I don&#039;t see the need to stress halacha observance as part of the national &quot;mission&quot; as such.   You might claim that the non-halachic community will disappear through intermarriage; if so, that&#039;s your opinion and I guess your need to see others observe follows, but to others, the collapse of the non-halachic Jewish community is far from a foregone conclusion.


And by the way, what you describe as &quot;middle ground&quot;, others would claim is religiously unacceptable.  There are plenty of places where the tzitzis check (or equivalent) is the bare minimum requirement.

		<description><![CDATA[Your question stems from American liberalism influence (for better or worse). The idea of the individual. But weren&#039;t you raised observant? You&#039;re asking that question as if you are some secular outsider. Judaism is a national religion. It&#039;s about the &#039;we&#039; not the &quot;I&quot;. It&#039;s about a common mission, the common practices of us a nation built on a common history and beliefs. We are Jewish &quot;people,&quot; so we as a people have to survive FOR that common mission (if you believe in that mission). We function as a community. Since when have we functioned as a whole bunch of individuals doing anything they wanted? That never works. That never works for anything you want to survive past your immediate lifetime. 


Obviously, there is a nice middle ground between giving everyone a tsitsis check and everyone just free styling everything and anything.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since we&#039;re specifically not talking about book learning, there is a limit to what we can expect from schools. We need to simultaneously have role models, or else everything the teacher/rebbe does will fade pretty quickly.

Of course, this is a catch-22. We can&#039;t provide enough adult role models to influence the children without having already solved the problem. BUT, we can at least provide them with examples of adults trying to improve. If kids at least know many adults do try to have meaningful experiences, they&#039;ll retain the idea that it&#039;s important, not a side-line adjunct to the religion itself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think if you want any sort of change, you need to narrow the &quot;paradigm.&quot; In my experience, what you call for exists already. My community has a typical MO shul. Across the street is a real funky Carlbachian Happy Minyan with no rabbi. Down the block is a Persian Chabad (of all things). Further down is more of a lithuanian shul. And guess what? People go in and out from all of these. The kids growing up know all these places are at their finger types and converse with people from all these places. Simchat Torah has people walking up and own the corridor in and out of different shuls. 


Therefore, I think your paradigm shift needs to happen in the schools. The educational institutions are very much narrowly focused to one sort of hashkafa and so you either fit or you&#039;re miserable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Other things my shul would have:

2- Short thoughts scattered through the service (eg before Barekhu) about prayer. Not the laws, the content.

3- An ethics clause. When keeping Shabbos needed strengthening, there were shuls that limited receiving honors to people not known to be Shabbos violators. My dream shul wouldn&#039;t give honors to known tax cheats or the like.


4- Chessed projects -- not &quot;just&quot; davening and shiurim. (A &quot;three pillar&quot; religious center.)

		<description><![CDATA[What sbout people who sometimes want to go to the movies Friday night, but want to still be accepted by the frum community?  Is there a place for such a person?  Does any O group explicitly accept this kind of &quot;drop-in whenever you like&quot; behavior?  Because this is what a lot of people would like.

No, we can&#039;t all move OOT where this is more accepted.

		<description><![CDATA[When did Shabbos shachris get so long? It certainly wasn&#039;t always this way. Tefilos got added, someone decided that we should lain a whole parsha (or two!) every week, we added a sermon because that&#039;s what the pastors did in Germany, and it seemed like a nice idea... 

I think the problem isn&#039;t our decreasing attention spans. The problem is that the length of shul Shabbos morning got out of hand.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The yeshivos back in pre-war Lithuania had qiddush with a small breakfast followed by a learning session between Torah reading and Mussaf. So there is ample room to make a &quot;frum&quot; argument that this is a pre-blessed non-innovation.

If I would start my own shul, I would move the qiddush to before Mussaf and shift the rabbis sermon into being a talk during the qiddush.


We have to acknowledge our decreasing attention spans. Rather than trying to get people to sit still for 2 hours and fail, or to come late because they can&#039;t handle the full duration, I think it is time to accommodate. Especially since there is no actual halachic issue involved.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[excellent post- except for the kiddush club part. it is disrespectful to step out in the middle of davening to grab a drink with your friends, especially if it means missing krias hatorah and part of musaf. now, if you suggested having a break after krias hatorah for kiddush followed by musaf, that would be a different story. and i have seen one place where they do that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This has been a good dramatic buildup.  Really. Well done.

But, I think somehow you need to ground your innovations in some psychological research and probably halacha.

If we primarily process experience through our mind, how is Judaism failing the modern mind? There must be some clinical research on how certain environments fail to generate gratitude and positive feelings of well being.

I guess I&#039;d like you to consult the most cutting-edge literature, and report back with sources and footnotes. 

But excellent work in drawing focus to your site. The blog sphere has been crackling with anticipation for your ideas. That&#039;s pretty cool.]]></description>
