		<description><![CDATA[Dear Rabbi Fink,
I appreciate that you think it was a wider spectrum 
of people getting ordination than you might have seen in the past - 
however, I think it is a pretty generous thing to refer to it as a 
&quot;Rainbow&quot; considering that (never mind that they were all Orthodox and 
all male (!)) they were all white, of approximately the same age range, 
and of approximately the same socio-economic range.  In sociological 
blogs like yours, people would normally use words like &quot;Rainbow&quot; to mean
 something more...diverse.  Shana tova!]]></description>
