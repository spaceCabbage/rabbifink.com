		<description><![CDATA[No - please don&#039;t feel sorry. We are both doing what we believe G-d wants us to be doing. Nobody is forcing me to do anything - if I chose a different &quot;lifestyle&quot; I wouldn&#039;t be at peace because it wouldn&#039;t seem honest to me. Nobody wants to live a lie and that&#039;s how it would feel to me. So essentially we&#039;re each doing what works for us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I believe what God wants is for us to be in relationship with God and to follow God&#039;s commandments. When I say &quot;what works for them&quot; I mean what works for them in facilitating them to do these things. If not for Reform Judaism, I would not have a relationship with God, and I would do far fewer mitzvot.

		<description><![CDATA[Yes - most farfetched.  Interestingly, if I were starting my own religion, national revelation is a clear loser -- Xtianity is like 2.5 billion. Islam, two billion.

Even the silly Mormons: five or six million here, five or six million around the world.  Two huge universities (BYU, BYU Idaho.)  And they seem immune to concerns about going on far flung missions, becoming educated, going to coed classes in college.



Individual revelation is the absolute winner in terms of keeping people faithful and G-d believing.



Frum Jews can barely figure out a way to go to college anymore (most can&#039;t), or spy a girl&#039;s elbow without starting a riot. 



What went wrong..? :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i like religious practice a lot.  I like tradition a lot. 

I think the way religious people think about themselves/their religion is pretty toxic.

But I think the acts/rituals are fine.  If someone keeps shabbot and says &quot;I do it because it feels meaningful to me and connects me to a tradition that feels meaningful to me,&quot; I&#039;m interested.

If someone says they do it because they want to be close to G-d, I&#039;m an apikorsos, they have a share in the world to come, I&#039;m a kofer, they know what is right, I am going after my desires, they are the future, I am the past, they will survive, I will perish, G-d is on their side, G-d hates me, Jews are right and everyone else is wrong, etc. etc. etc.&quot;

Well, since that is what i see in orthodoxy -- I am working my way towards G-d, and away from them.  Away from Torah, and towards G-d.  Away from scummy ideas, and towards G-d.  It&#039;s all abuse.  And I just have to stop thinking my abuser has power over me. But that is MY problem...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah. Mormonism is based on a carnival huckster claiming he and he alone saw writing on gold plates in a language that never existed about people who couldn&#039;t (miracles aside) exist, and repented. The power to make Joseph Smith repent is claimed to be part of the proof of the religion. Mind you, the evidence of the gold plates was kept from everyone but the &quot;former&quot; con-man. The 11 witnesses to the plates, all from Smith&#039;s family or friends, felt something in a cloth and cannot attest that the cold metal was indeed gold. That really is a bit much, no?

A carnival huckster and 11 of his nearest and dearest is pretty much the opposite of the so-called &quot;Kuzari Proof&quot;, no?

They believe Jesus was an alien who lived on the planet Kobol, led an exemplary life, and therefore was given dominion over earth as his reward. And in fact any good Mormon (together with any wives he is properly bound with) will also be given a world to run as their afterlife reward. In their parlance, &quot;God&quot; is a collective noun, like &quot;family&quot; and in fact, Joseph Smith often spoke of &quot;the family of God&quot;.

Can we agree this is the most farfetched of any of the significantly populated religious belief systems?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The hafataros in question (mainly Yeshaiahu) are saying that the point of the Torah is to be a toolset to recreating oneself as a better person, and if you&#039;re not trying to be a better person, you&#039;re just annoying G-d with all that ritual stuff.

Orthodoxy, however, is a social construct. I am not convinced that it -- in any of its leading forms -- is still promoting Torah. Rather than &quot;frumkeit&quot;, which historically meant a use of ritual as a way to assuage the instinctive search for holiness. With no thought to becoming a better person, making sure G-d&#039;s Will is done, etc...

(Simple self-test to distinguish frumkeit from avodas Hashem: If someone else does the charity work you wanted to, more effectively than you could have. Do you feel thrilled that what you wanted to see in the world came to be? Or do you feel like someone robbed you of an opportunity to be the savior of those people in need?)]]></description>

Do you feel thrilled that what you wanted to see in the world came to be? Or do you feel like someone robbed you of an opportunity to be the savior of those people in need?)</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I&#039;m not aware of higher tax brackets in Israel&quot;


The income tax brackets in Israel have very steep progressivity. That means that a tech professional could easily find him/herself in a 45% income tax bracket. But that isn&#039;t the main difference in taxation between Israel and the USA for a professional (places like NY and CA can also reach those levels of marginal tax rates pretty easily).


Instead, it is all the OTHER taxes in Israel that severely eat into your purchasing power. For example, a 16% VAT on nearly everything you purchase. That includes home purchases, so if you purchase a home for $300k, you will also be paying VAT of 16% (unless a newly proposed law reducing that passes). Furthermore, there are all sort of purchase taxes on other things such as vehicles. You could easily pay an additional 80% when you purchase a new vehicle. So if you buy a [relatively inexpensive] minivan for $25,000, you will pay another $20,000 in purchase tax, and another $4,000 of VAT. For a grand total of $49,000!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not debating your perspective Susan (it is yours...therefore it is valid). But it has always baffled me at how egalitarianism has been highlighted as an issue which pushes Jews away from Orthodox Judaism. I was in the Reform community for 6 years before I ever entered an Orthodox synagogue. I had heard, for most of that time, how unequal women were within Orthodox Judaism. And it terrified me. However, I felt nothing but incredible ease and relief at sitting in the women&#039;s section...with little to no pressure to be completely comfortable with the service. So yes, I did feel like a spectator...at that point. As time passed, I still felt comfortable behind the mechitza. You see, I can daven/pray anywhere. I don&#039;t need to be called up to the bima to feel like I&#039;m participating in the service. It&#039;s like I don&#039;t look at the Rabbi, giving his drasha and thinking, &quot;Wow...I feel left out...I can&#039;t get up there and speak!&quot;. It may be a personality thing...I don&#039;t know. But I honestly never, ever felt marginalized as a women within Orthodox Judaism. Now as a Black person...well, that&#039;s an entirely different story! ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is that for many of us, the Orthodox Jewish lifestyle is very difficult and pressure-ridden.  We are encouraged to have large families, which means we need to earn enough money to support lots of kids, and thus have to balance work pressures with the pressure of lots of kids.  Shabbos and Yom Tov preparations are fraught with stress.  We&#039;re supposed to fit into to our daily schedule three minyanim, time for learning and community/social events.  For those of us who aren&#039;t exceptionally organized and who need a good night&#039;s sleep, frum life is a never-ending rat race trying to get it all done and always being under pressure.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Havdalah is rare among C and R Jews altogether.&quot;

I&#039;m not sure why you say this. I&#039;ve always found it a little interesting that after a day of shopping, travelling, whatever-ing, that some of my CJ relatives come home and do their whole havdallah thing.

&quot;And can we seriously debate whether O has more or less ritual than the liberal movements?&quot;



Of course not! See my comment(s) from last night. The question isn&#039;t the NUMBER of rituals, but rather the level of FOCUS on the rituals they do have.


If you want to talk about numbers of rituals, OJ beats all other streams of Judaism and probably beats all other religions as well (maybe even combined ... heh heh).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well... what did you mean by this then?

what we should have borrowed from the kiruv programs, and the Mormons, is the emphasis on positive Jewish experiences. People with positive Jewish experiences will want to be Orthodox. Kiruv organizations craft incredible Jewish experiences. Trips, Shabbatons, Shabbat meals, learning with charismatic teachers, and tons of personal attention and love are the ingredients for kiruv. They also are the clues we need to craft a solution for our struggles. Advertising a product is not simply an opportunity to tell the public about your product.

		<description><![CDATA[So then you&#039;re comparing apples and oranges. Havdalah is rare among C and R Jews altogether. The fact that when they do make havdalah it is a special occasion ceremony around it makes their sung havdalah more like the kiruv rarity than the quick havdalah you might be making at home.

We also are conflating ritual with ceremony.

And can we seriously debate whether O has more or less ritual than the liberal movements? Want to compare the amount of rite required to live according to the Mishnah Berurah plus all those English popularizations that came out lately vs CLJS standards? Or is the readership simply a debating club willing to argue any topic raised?

Or for that matter, topics not raised. This post wasn&#039;t about kiruv. REF&#039;s critique was about mainstream education&#039;s overemphasis on academics at the expense of giving them a Judaism they would actually want.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course OJ Does havdala. Except for oranges on seder plates and musical instruments during services(which comes from temple days, so technically not a reform invention) there is almost nothing in the way of ritual not sourced in OJ. After all, hlachically observant Judaism was the only option until a few hundred years ago. Also, the point isn&#039;t to &quot;do&quot; or &quot;focus&quot; on more ritual, we do the rituals that were commanded by God as per the understanding and tradition of our sages. No more no less. The point, however is, to infuse them with depth, energy, simcha, conviction, vitality etc. In RJ the focus may be on ritual, but most kids drop most of them from the ages of 13- 30 or whenever they have kids. One reform rabbi calls it, pediatric Judaism. In OJ the problem is that we have drawn a line in the sand between believers and non believers and worked so hard to protect our belief that we have forgotten that belief is a by product of who we are, as much or more as who we are is a by product of belief. Had I been born in Saudi Arabia, I would not be Jewish. If I would still be a believing Muslim would depend on what my other options were socially and how positive/negative my experiences had been previously with Islam. 

For me growing up it was simple. The people I met who were orthodox simply led what I felt to be deeper, more focused, happier lives. The rest - belief, observance, understanding, search for truth etc. all came later.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not aware of higher tax brackets in Israel.  frankly america has some of the highest tax rates in the world (see all the talk about corporate &quot;inversions&quot;).  on a cost of living adjusted basis I would imagine that for Orthdoox Jews who send their kids to private religious schools k-12 (plus year in Israe), an &quot;average&quot; family is much better off in Israel these days than in the USA.  Certainly in terms of sustaining a community that is not ipso-facto meant to be only for &quot;the 1%&quot; there really is no choice but Israel.  US federal, state and local funds for private religius school tuition are simply not going to come in any time soon.  there is an inherent double taxation (you pay local taxes for your neighbors school tuition and then pay private school tuition for your own kids) there in the USA which won&#039;t go away.  When you live in israel you don&#039;t need to fund trips to Israel.  or a year abroad in Israel.]]></description>

Rather, the difference is that once someone makes aliyah, they expect their money to be tighter and people live accordingly. When you and your neighbors never expected the funds for a &quot;higher&quot; (read: cushier) standard of living, you aren&#039;t frustrated by its absence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As someone who has become frum, watched others become frum, watched some go otd, helped some come back, taught in Yeshiva, started a shul and lived on a college campus doing kiruv, I can tell you all that R&#039; Fink is, IMO, absolutely right. About every single point. There are many factors that always swim around in our heads but the bottom line is that if we enjoy something, we will find a way to keep doing it, if we hate it, we will find a way out. It&#039;s a survival instinct. And a great one at that, it keeps us happy enough to keep living, even through struggles. There are maybe a handful of people who do things for purely intellectual, non experiential reasons, and I imagine that they are miserable.  Everyone I know personally who either became frum or came back to OJ after leaving it did so because they LOVED something about it that they never found elsewhere, be it community, torah, inspiring role models etc. And everyone who left has had either one or many negative experiences. True, lots of people just &#039;lost the spark&#039; and just go through the motions, but even they stay bc they feel its better than any other alternative. They may not be totally halachically observant, but they are Orthodox. 

The more geshmak, fun, warm, communal, homey, and inspiring OJ is, the more people will want it, no matter how much they struggle to believe. I have had a brilliant, total athiest tell me this exactly. He comes because he just enjoys it. He doesnt feel that way about reform judaism or yoga meditation. This is a realization that we must come to if we want to even approach the issue of the future of OJ. Thank you R Fink.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;but there are fewer rituals in non-Orthodox Judaism and it&#039;s not even close.&quot;

I don&#039;t think anyone disagrees with this statement. I think it is patently obvious that orthodox Judaism has, by far, the most rituals of any stream of Judaism (and perhaps even of any religion that exists today).


But that&#039;s exactly why this statement of yours from the post above is so confusing - &lt;i&gt;&quot;I think the way to do this is by shifting our communal focus from knowledge and beliefs to rituals and experiences.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;



You want to shift focus from knowledge/beliefs to ritual/experiences, but we ALREADY are overloaded (certainly on a relative basis) on ritual (as you clearly stated in the comment above). Are you suggesting that we add even MORE focus on ritual? Ask any high school kid if they want more focus on ritual, ask them if it will strengthen their joy of religion. You and I, and the rest of us, know exactly what the answer to that question is. And experiences? As orthodox Jews, we experience far more religion, on a far more regular basis, than any other stream of Judaism (and again, probably more than any other religion, except perhaps those ruled by fundamentalist regimes).


I think you ned to be clearer about what you mean by &quot;increasing ritual and experiences&quot;, a few examples would be very welcome.]]></description>
