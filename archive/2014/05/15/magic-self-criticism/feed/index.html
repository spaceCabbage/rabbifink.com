		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Historic event&quot;. Whoa - ego alert! This is too much self-inflated puffery, even by your standards.
The event basically sounds like a chance for lefty rabbis like rabbi horowitz (who wears the whole getup for street cred with the right, but clamors for the accolades of the left) to beat their chest and murmur &quot;we&#039;re guilty, we&#039;re guilty.&quot; An orthodox version of white guilt. And what has white guilt done for America? Exactly.
By the way, you refer to this &quot;historic event&quot; as a dialogue. Sounds pretty one sided to me. How did the OTD folks engage in being self-critical? Did they, perhaps, consider that they were stereotyping orthodox Jews based on the small sample size they knew? Did they consider if maybe they went overbroad in some of their accusations? Did they engage in self-analysis if the reason they went off was more because they couldn&#039;t hack it, and attack the community as a defense mechanism? Did they ever reflect that with all of the problems in orthodoxy, the atheist world has more? Did they contemplate that maybe they left the community before they were mature enough to fully appreciate its values? Did they consider that there is no community in the world, religious or not, that does not contain elements of hypocrisy and shallowness? Did they apprehend that maybe they&#039;re just plain old misfits, who wouldn&#039;t feel comfortable no matter where they were? That maybe they were the problem, and not the community they left?
I mean, when you invite two sides to a &quot;historic event&quot;, there ought to be some quid pro quo on both sides. I see nothing of that here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The only &quot;brand name&quot; at the meeting was Rabbi Shafran. He was chosen since you needed a brand name to make your comical claim of it being a &quot;historic meeting&quot;. The other 4 rabbis were from the left-of-center and could not accomplish a whole lot of which you seek.

&lt;i&gt;It’s especially difficult for people who part of a group that markets itself as perfect or potentially perfect.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

It&#039;s cute, Eliyahu, how you find it &quot;especially difficult&quot; for your opponents (yes, that&#039;s what they are) to be self-critical but do not find it &quot;especially difficult&quot; for your own ilk.]]></description>
