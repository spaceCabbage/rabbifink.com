		<description><![CDATA[There is an important limitation to their data: it seems to come from their patients and not from representatives samples of the entire community. So for example, in their practice, they see more anxiety disorders and fwer depressive orders compared to findings about the secular public. However, because they limit themselves to those coming to the clinic they may be wrong about the orthodox community as a whole. Perhaps the depressives in the community are just less likely to seek clinical help.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;note that there has been some headway in our data collection aspirations.&quot;

There was an article in the 4/22/14 Mishpacha about the research of the  ARCC Institute( Applied Research &#038; Community Collaboration) and Dr. Yitzchak Schechter of Monsey’s Bikur Cholim&#039;s Center for Applied Psychology. This is a link to their areas of research,  eg, &quot;Differences between chassidim and non-chassidim regarding ADHD &#038; other disorders&quot;

https://arccinstitute.org/headlines-findings/

(In February, Dr.  Schechter also ran in Monsey a groundbreaking  “Talking to your children about development, maturity, and the responsibility that goes with it” with the participation of R. Shmuel Kamenetsky, reported in Hamodia; see ARCC blog article)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Which is why I was so intrigued by this book I noticed (I can’t remember where)&quot;

I  read about it in a NYT article in January(&quot;Book Explores Ways Faith Is Kept, or Lost, Over Generations&quot;):


 The article mentioned Judaism and the mother as Dr. Salamon mentioned:

&quot;... for religious transmission, having a close bond with one’s father matters even more than a close relationship with one’s mother.”There are some interesting exceptions. Transmission of Judaism, for example, depends more on a close bond with one’s mother than with one’s father — perhaps because Judaism has traditionally held that the faith is inherited from the mother. Among Jews with a close maternal bond, 90 percent considered themselves Jewish, versus only 60 percent of those who weren’t close to their mothers.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vern Bengston is a serious researcher. I have been on professional panels with him and truly respect his work.
Couple of points - In Jewish families Mothers matter more. The data on Jewish family is as you note limited by the smaller number of Jewish participants - but the book is definitely worthwhile and should be on every Rabbis, educators and even parents desks. 
Now if we can only be allowed, encouraged to do our own research in the open, not surreptitiously!]]></description>
