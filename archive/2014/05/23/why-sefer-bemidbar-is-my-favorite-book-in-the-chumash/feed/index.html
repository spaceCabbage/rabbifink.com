		<description><![CDATA[very nice post.
i&#039;m glad that you as an (Orthodox) Rabbi encourage questions. But what do you say when the questions on the Torah begin to pile up, in the hundreds, such as contradictions in the text, or anachronisms, and against science, without satisfactory answers. While at the same time, by suggesting the very simple response that the Torah was human-authored and from multiple sources pretty much answers all these problems.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, what an inspiring post!  I always found Bemidbar painful, with the indelible Spies&#039; sins and Moshe&#039;s rock-hitting.  Every year I&#039;m inclined to yell out during Kriat HaTorah &quot;No, Moshe! Don&#039;t hit the rock!&quot;.   I guess not everyone has experienced the pain of mistakes that have &quot;burned bridges&quot; like me, and that probably makes a difference.
How ironic that in Israel, an OTD-er is called &quot;Chozer B&#039;She&#039;ela&quot; (as if it were the opposite of &quot;Chozer B&#039;tshuva&quot; - maybe someone misunderstood Teshuva as having THE answer, and not teshuva as &quot;return&quot;), when questions can often make us more comfortable and even enamored with the tradition we have received, as you have pointed out, Rav Fink.  Yishar Koach.]]></description>
