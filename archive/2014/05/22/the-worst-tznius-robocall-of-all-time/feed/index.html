		<description><![CDATA[Excuse me, Dovid Klein, but you do realize that you are giving the impression that *you* think this robocall was truthful, reasonable and just fine. Is that truly what you think?

Furthermore, this obfuscation is a well-known tactic to keep people from paying attention to the real issue.  Is a personal attack *really* the way you want to go? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for responding. You are probably right and sound like you know more than you initially wrote, and I am still under the influence of my Bais Yaakov education, hence less likely to see things for what they are...


I guess I just wanted to clear up the misconception about the hatzalah calls - I can&#039;t say I verified it firsthand then, only secondhand from a number of firsthanders, if that makes sense. It was a big story then and still being referenced now, not that anyone is saying that now there were no hatzalah calls.


Also, it&#039;s positive in terms of not going down the you&#039;re gonna burn in gehennom and cause cancer, etc. road. And while saying that if you do this you prevent tragedy is a very short leap from if you don&#039;t do it you cause tragedy, I personally maintain that it&#039;s still different, and deserves distinction.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your comments.

First, I am not so sure that you are correct about the intent of this robocall. Second, I am not so sure that &quot;last time&quot; there were no hatzalah calls. Third, I disagree that attaching the merits of tznius to shmira can ever be positive. You want positive? Talk about something other than speculative spiritual protection. Talk about practical and tangible things. Fourth, the facts that I omitted from this post about the way this &quot;positive&quot; asifa came about and the private manner in which the &quot;psak&quot; was derived is more deserving of derision than the public things that I actually wrote about here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read through all the comments and was surprised it took until the end for someone to bring this up.


The &quot;historic vehaya machanechah kadosh asifa&quot; was not this most recent one, it was a few years back, and like Puke says, Hatzalah confirmed that there were no calls for the next several days (don&#039;t remember exactly how many). This robocall was asking attendees of this more recent asifah to recall the aftermath of the &quot;historic&quot; one and take that leap. By no means do I necessarily agree with this robocall, nor the concept behind it, but I feel that the people behind it were unnecessarily vilified because the call was misunderstood. 


The other thing that was misrepresented was what some other commenters  picked up on - this is not for financial gain, the sheitels are cut for free.


And while you and I may not agree that tznius and tragedies are linked, there is admittedly a big difference between saying if you don&#039;t cut your sheitel, you will cause horrible things to happen and if you do cut your sheitel, you will merit shemirah. For all everyone feels that tznius is rammed down our throats with threats of scalding fires and flesh ripping exercises and what not, this was more positive and encouraging.


Lastly, whatever your personal feelings on sheitel length is, the women of Lakewood are walking around with wigs that are growing increasingly more provocative by the day. Granted, Lakewood, like the rest of us, have many, many serious things to work on, and I may not agree that this should be top priority, but still, it is a tznius concern, for those who value modesty and refinement as virtues... 


R&#039; Fink, I usually agree with a lot of your articles, but here I feel that you were unfair to the people and rabbis of Lakewood.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LOL...yup that&#039;s how I talk...somehow it has not been a problem over the years. 
German Jews held Kant in great esteem, with most German Jewish philosophers responding to Kant&#039;s ideas, dsepite their recognition that he and the German idealists who followed were more than a bit anti Semitic. Today we have a more comprehensive reading of this great philosopher and an ability to sort out his ideas. Today it is possible to read him as a social contract theorist  without buying into his pietist Pauline ideas about autonomy.
A recent excellent book by the Orthodox philosopher Sam Fleischacker on toran min hashamayim is a variation on the Kantian idea that morality is more basic than halacha.]]></description>

So tznius = ugly?

God help the Lakewood girl unlucky enough to be born pretty.

&#062; Do you know for sure that modesty doesn&#039;t help a persons self esteem

If your definition of modesty is making oneself as unattractive as possible, then it certainly won’t help with self-esteem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I want to say over a claim of Kant&#039;s that would give a different spin to the robo call. Students of philosophy generally know that Kant held we cannot know what the universe  is really like outside of our experience. Thus he held we cannot know what goes on in heaven, the relationship between what we do and the corresponding reward or punishment. To assert we do know is superstition and moves humanity back from enlightenment to the dark ages, etc. 

The flip side was  that Kant said that morality itself requires us to believe as a matter of faith in an afterlife where there are just rewards and punishments . As he might put it morality requires us to imagine the way the world really is as one where  good deeds are rewarded and bad deeds punished, if not during our life here on earth then in our afterlife. We need to imagine this because otherwise reason alone is insufficient to provide a motive to act morally, especially when we can get away with benefitting from doing something bad. He thought that such imaginings though not justified on the basis of reasons and evidence  are a necessary part of a moral life. For him religion does not tell us about morality, rather morality provides a basis, however epistemically weak, for religion.  

For Kant  when we see such claims as this deed leads to this reward, the objection should be to the claim that we know this, not to the exercise of the religious imagination as such. Reading Rabbi Fink I get the sense he objects to even “dreaming’ that a mitzvah might have a  reward in this world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I reject that tznius and beauty have anything to do with each other. So it&#039;s not my contention that shorter wigs are uglier and therefore more tznius, that was the thinking of the people behind the edict. But I really don&#039;t understand why I or you or anyone should stand for this simply because we agree that there is a tznius concept in Orthodox Judaism.

Wait. Do you think wearing a shorter sheitel does anything for the wearer? As in, protects her from harm?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Rabbi Fink, 
No one is arguing about the obnoxiousness of this story an the mispresentation of tznius portrayed by te robocall. After all, who is in position to judge why god chooses to save or punish Someone. However, I find it beyond pathetic that someone of your intellect uses the &quot;obnoxiousness and stupidity&quot; of that particular robocall to validate your agenda that in actuality wearing shorter shaitels that are less flattering &quot;does nothing for the wearer.&quot; Every first grader knows that trick. Focus on one particular abnormality to avoid the issue at hand. Let me ask you a question. Are shorter shaitels more tznius? Do you remember when in this very article you wrote they make the wearer look less attractive? It is hard to argue that they are not. And if they are indeed more tznius then is it possible, just maybe, that taking on a more tznius form of dress can actually bring bracha and health to your family? Do you believe in the concept of dressing modest and the fact that any mitzvah can protect us? Do you know for sure that modesty doesn&#039;t help a persons self esteem and marriage. Yes, that robocall and and it&#039;s absurd claim that the reason why there were no hatzolah calls was because of a rabbinic takana is ridiculous but please don&#039;t insult my intelligence by using one crazy story to &quot;character assassinate&quot; an entire belief. One has absolutely nothing to do with the other. Dressing modestly is an important concept and potentially has physical rewards. 
I honestly expected more from you. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I feel bad for these women. They are told how to dress, how to style their hair, how to manage their menstrual cycle, when and how to touch their husbands - all dictated by men in beards. So the one aspect of self image they can control, the length of their fake hair, that allows them some individuality and control, now that has to be taken from them as well. I long for the day when religion is cast aside and mocked as it should be. It has been ten years since I learned my last blatt in yeshivah and I could not be happier.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just for the record, I am opposed to extremism. And I do think there is plenty for the men to work on!

But let me get this straight.  You want us to believe that all the young women walking around with sheitels down to their pupiks are not trying to look sexy and make every man&#039;s head turn?  And that the husbands who encourage (or at least don&#039;t discourage) this don&#039;t want all the other men to stare at their wives?  Or do you want to say that there is nothing wrong with it?

(BTW I don&#039;t think the sheital-machers are making money.  It&#039;s possible they are being paid by some askan but the women who get their sheital cut are not paying.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While there&#039;s no arguing with the absurdity of this episode your response does highlight for me one saddening point (beyond the obvious.) After a run through Neviim  it is fairly clear that in the times of active Prophecy we (as a nation) didn&#039;t listen to them or their directive all that much. Presently without the distraction of active Prophets those who seek to offer any sort of communal guidance are both held to that standard and ridiculed when they don&#039;t live up to it, this is a bit of an odd paradox with an obvious logical explanation.

While the instigators of this &quot;Call&quot; are by no means prophets  the visceral need to respond and the perpetual arrogant tone used in an effort to disprove (what is obviously preposterous) only reinforces a position were segments of the community become trained  in the belief that its impossible for anyone to know or relay the will of Hashem.  To be clear, I&#039;m not saying either side is right or wrong but simply highlighting what to me is a very sad note. Everyone loves commentary, everyone loves to offer an opinion, and everyone loves to proves everyone else wrong, but taking a step back is it really necessary?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This is not Torah.&quot;
Sadly, though, it is. The Gemara is filled with statements from Talmudic rabbis, ascribing events of all sorts to mitzvos or aveiros of one kind of another. It&#039;s all over the map. One imagines the &quot;scoffers&quot; (the Talmudic term for people exactly like you) (no pejorative intended) laughing and saying &quot;Gimme a break, does this rabbi know the root cause of everything?&quot; Of course time and distance changes everything, and its easy for orthodox Jews to say that they had some sort of ruach hakodesh, exactly the way orthodox Jews 1500 years hence will speak of contemporary Rabbis.
I do not advocate throwing the baby out with the bathwater and abandoning religion. That&#039;s the mistake the OTDers make (despite you trying to lionize them, but a different topic.)  But honest people have to recognize that nearly all of the flaws and problems we have with orthodoxy today were all in existence in Talmudic times also. Because our curriculum is based on the Talmud, our thinking and hence our outlook on life is exactly the same as those of the Talmudic rabbis. We view goyim the same way they viewed goyim. Our sermons are the same as their sermons. Their prejudices are our prejudices. Not saying there&#039;s ben no developments at all, of course, but for all intents and purposes, we&#039;re exactly the same. The Lakewood wig call is a direct heir of hundreds of similar Talmudic pronouncements.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sarah, i don&#039;t consider myself being a chashuv.guy, just a dude who.so someone insulting rabbi Fink. I&#039;m pn the internet because my rabbonim didn&#039;t assur it.
Second of all, the one who rip apart  was not me but rabbi Klein whp accused rabbi Fink to be a faker and to  bring down the true bnei and bas Torah. So i assume that you too think the same about rabbi Fink. In this case, i will take his defense, even if i dont agree with him everytime.
The post of rabbi Fink has to do about a robotcall , npt about all orthodoxy. To accuse him to have a bad influence on orthodox Jews is a lie, it&#039;s motzi shem ra.
So i didn&#039;t want to start a fight, but defend a nice guy who has been dragged in the mud for no reason.
My question are legitimate and I&#039;m open to discussion, civilized of course. 
So sorry, but i won&#039;t shup up. If you see a problem, ypu have two choices: be part of the problem, or be part of the solution.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Oh, and if you’d like to make an appointment with a wig salon professional press 1 now!&quot; 

If the recording actually said that, it raises a question: Did the wig salon pay for this feature? If so, how much was paid and where did the money go? Did it go to Tzedakah, or into someone&#039;s pocket?

And this raises the underlying question: Was this ridiculous robocall financially motivated to enrich a handful of influential people?

		<description><![CDATA[The real answer is that there&#039;s a female motivational speaker hailing from Lakewood who has made wig-cutting her crusade.  I tried to post her name and info yesterday but my comment was blocked or deleted.  Basically, she had a dream in which her sainted ancestor came to her and told her to help improve tznius, and she came up with this wig-cutting scheme.  She goes to bais yaakovs all over the country speaking about it.  It&#039;s pretty scary since the dream sounds almost like a psychotic episode.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry you have such a disturbed feeling of tznius. But I&#039;m not saying you or me or my wife are on the level to take on themselves to look not good to be tznius. But even though we not be ready to jump to the highest level of tznius no one would argue that it&#039;s more tznius to only wear baggy not so stylish clothes and I am not embarrassed of admitting that woman that do take that upon themselves are, if done for the right reasons, are acting in an honorable manner. Yes my self would not want my wife to act like that but that doesn&#039;t create a angry response inside of me to ridiculously claim that there is nothing commendable to it. Unfortunately you are too insecure to realize that. Mrs Sarah, it&#039;s not only about covering your knees. I&#039;m sorry you can&#039;t understand that. It seems pretty obvious to me.]]></description>
