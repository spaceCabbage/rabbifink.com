		<description><![CDATA[I am posting my transcript of the shmuz referenced.  The first 2 sections are notes - which set a couple of basic ideas he comes back to. From section 3 on, I did my best to transcribe exactly what he said.  There are a few bracketed comments - which means I couldn&#039;t get the exact words, but try to summarize.  
I did not find his remarks to be anything but deflating to my hope that the charedi mindset could have some small shift towards klal yisrael, but his remarks make it clear that they have absolutely no ability to be anything but self righteous and self centered - using G-d&#039;s Torah as a tool for self aggrandizement.  It is a tragedy.

1.      Dispute of R Yishmael and R. Shimon
     a.      The Talmud (Berachos 35b) relates a dispute between the sages Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai. Rabbi Ishmael notes that on one hand it says (Joshua 1:8): &quot;This book of the Torah shall not be removed from your mouth and you shall occupy yourself with it day and night.&quot; On the other hand, it says in the second portion of Shema (Devarim 11:14): &quot;And you shall gather your grain, your wine, and your oil … and you shall eat and you shall be satisfied&quot;. The question arises, if one is
expected to study Torah day and night, when will one have time to be involved in agriculture or other business affairs? Rabbi Ishmael answers that Torah study is not expected to be our sole occupation all the time. We should find time to study both during the day and at night but it should be combined with a worldly occupation. Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai disagrees and says that if a person is on a high enough level he will be able to totally dedicate himself to Torah study and he will not need to be involved in any worldly occupation. Rabbi Shimon explains that when the Torah says &quot;and you shall gather grain …&quot;, this refers to someone who is not on that high level. The Talmud concludes that many tried to live up to the high standard of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai and did not succeed; whereas, many followed the approach of Rabbi Ishmael and succeeded in both Torah study and their business affairs
      b.      Halachah – for the rabim, like RI, but if a yachid – like RSBY

2.       Vayikra rabbah (2,1)  Elef nichnasim lacheder v&#039;echad yotzei lehoraah. 1000 went in to a room and only one came out ready to teach.
   a.       Tosfos – chazakah olam limud naaseh gadol?
   b.      But “echad” doesn’t mean one.  1000 means following everyone else, but it is the echad who says I want to be a Talmud chacham. So if you are among the 1000, you should work.  But if you are the yachid, you should learn 
  c.      That yachid is the one who follows the chazakah –  it’s a chazakah he will become a gadol.
  d.      RSBY says – [something about if 100, if 10, if 2, I am ..] but bc he is a yachid 
  e.     If I am a yachid, then I’m learning anyway – not just when everyone else shows up.  

3.       Hashkafa. Normally we speak indirect and want everyone to pick up the hashkafa.  If say direct, you won’t listen.  Chachmah only comes indirect.  Therefore a lot of shmuzim I give, I use extreme meshalim to make a point.  Everyone here – they get my shmuzin.  If I ever had a doubt someone would take it the wrong way, I wouldn’t. 
    a.      “Sometimes things get recorded and get over to different places, and people that are not used to the yeshiva language, sometimes read things in between the lines differently and they get a bad impression and they can get a wrong understanding from what is said.  So I regret for people not to have a mistake, so for once to speak direct to explain our hashkafah a little bit and like this maybe to put it in the right perspective that people are understanding.  I’ll give one mashal for explaining.
   b. There is a chiyuv of hakaros hatov.  Chazal say if a person doesn’t have hakaras hatov to his friend, he won’t have hakros hatov to the Ribbo-shel-olom.  So who you are mechuyiv hakaros hatov? Chazal say Moshe is mechuyav hakaros hatov to the water that saved him from [garbled but basically for his time in the taivah] .  Klal yisrael was similarly to mitzrayim, because we lived in mitzrayim.  Hakoros hatov doesn’t have a limit. [another comment about parents doing for kids and kids recognizing it later in life – which he says he won’t explain bc they (his audience) just wouldn’t get it . Even he only when his kids got older did he start being extra respectful to his parents for all they had done for him and he called to say thank you].  
  c.      The same thing for a person who lives in a yeshiva. [something about yeshiva food, and minhag yerushalayim to not eat meat
on Mondays and Thursdays which the Mir keeps related to fasting, not keep but Shtelt zu?] point being the American who complains about fish doesn’t understand the effort of the yeshiva to keep a connection to the minhag and doesn’t appreciate it.
  d.     The same thing for example.  We’re sitting in learning, and there are people who are not sitting in learing in the country.  But well, there are countries around here that want to kill the country, yeah.  They don’t do what we do; they are not on the same hashkafah as us.  But they die, they fight.  We disagree with the way they live, but hakoros hatov.  We don’t have to be the policemans, the soldiers. Someone is fighting, someone is protecting you.  When a robber comes, what do you do?  There are no shomrim, yea? So you call the police.  [some garbled thought about shomrim, but essentially, you call the police].  There’s traffic , you have taines, not taines, l’maiseh – who takes care of it, the police.  [Something about traffic and buses, and traffic police]. Hakaros hatov.  A person is mechuyav to be makir tov.  Someone gives his kids to die on a war of eretz yisrael, we should give hakoros hatov.  It’s a chiyuv hakoros hatov.  And so you’ll feel bad? No.  
   e.     [Voice rising] And you know how much hakoros hatov they owes us?!  We believe that without learning, the country would not be kayem. So they owe hakoros hatov.  It wasn’t us saving the country. But the [reason Hashem gave us the EY, b-reishit, says Rashi, for the torah which is called reishit that would be learned there]. They have to kiss us, we have to kiss them.  They have to kiss us bigger.  This is what we have to believe.
                                                              f.     RSBY kol haolam kulo beshvilo [reference to “if 100..if 10.] . We have to believe it. 
  g.      So what happens?  We are teaching…I want to give you an example of hashkafah.  We teach the whole time, the world belongs because of us.  Because you sit and learn, the world is kayem.  R. Chayim Volozhiner shaar daled – a word of learning saves the world. Without learning, we would not have the world.  And if you learn like RSBY everything will be taken care of.  The world is kayem bishvil haTorah.   We got the Eretz Yisrael bishvil haTorah.  So a guy is asking “the whole world is me” so everyone owes me hakoros hatov. So a person [I presume he means a non-yeshiva person]  will hear that piece of shmuz, and say “ah, so we [the yeshiva people] don’t say thank you?” For sure we say thank you. R. Chayim Volozhiner said every soldier that gets killed in Eretz Yisrael goes straight to gan eden.  He was moser nefesh for yidden.  But again, our hashkafah is we want you to stay beis medrish, we want you to sit and learn.  We..the frum [?] people are the smallest army in this country.  We need a lot a more soldiers to …that Hashem will give us Eretz Yisrael good.  We are the soldiers that are keeping klal yisrael.  They are also saving. A’vaide. So we owe hakoros hatov to the people protecting us.  They owe US hakoros hatov for learning.  Our hashkafah is kol haolam lo nivrah ele
bishvil torah.  So what we are doing is more from what they are doing.  This is our hashkafah.   But it never takes away from the other hashkafah.  
  h.      Now why are we busy the whole time with torah and not with hakoros hatov to the soldiers, to the policemen, to the government?  Because in the end, to learn, I want to tell you one thing. I know most of you will disagree with me but I’m telling you for myself – to learn sometimes is hard.    I know for you its easy. You’re young….But it happens.  A nisayon.  Not to learn is easy.  A’vaide to fight is hard, to be moser nefesh is hard, to be a soldier is hard.  But when a person finds learning to be hard sometimes, you would think on the other side would be easier.  I was never on the other side, so I can’t tell you.   We have to mechazek our side, our learning.  We have to [garbled about the yetzer pushing someone not to learn] so we speak about how much you have to do it.  But it doesn’t mean to take away from the other side.  
                                                         i.      I’ll give one more example – some people took a recording in my name and they felt that what I said about mesiras nefesh for
the torah, to learn day and night, that the mesiras nefesh we spoke about was - like the chasmonayim were moser nefesh for torah, a person has to be moser nefesh for torah.   So again, what is the message?  The message is that even thought its VERY hard to learn, you have to do it. Every generation has its mesiras nefesh.   One generation’s was that they didn’t let physically to learn, and our generation’s mesiras nefesh that a person has to give is that all the friends go to trips and he stays and learns.  He has bad roommates that have (baruch Hashem in our yeshiva we don’t have it) they have advisors  not to use them. Its hard to be mesiras
nefesh.   In our generation, Hashem is not asking us, expecting us, and we’re not in a generation that we have to do things.  Our mesiras nefesh is to sit and learn day and night.   In our generation, a person is not allowed to come and say “Uh! Some people are not learning, I will do something today. I will use the violin, I will hit, I will scream.”  We are talmidim of Rav Shteinman, and this is
his hashkafah.   In our generation the job is to sit and learn, that’s all. The nisayon by us is electronic nisayon.  It’s a nisayon in the street, it’s a nisayon of what will be with me, what will come out of me. That, here you have to be strong.  Chas veshalom for
person to think that he’s allowed to or he has to, we’re not allowed to and asked to and would not be appreciate and to be just assur and disgusting if a person goes and hits and does [?] to a person who is not learning but who is disturbing him.  In our generation, you know who disturbing you, it’s the yetzer harah. He’ll tell you to stop to learn.  Fight with him. Push him away. Again, what we speak of mesiras nefesh for torah, its mesiras NEFESH for torah.  So we speak out our job. We bring out the koach of mesiras nefesh le-torah.  But about in our generation we don’t mean that we have to do something.  And I’ll tell you something.  I saw in my life the guy that taught the way mesiras nefesh is physically – I never saw them becoming talmidei chachamim.  The guy that mesiras nefesh for torah by them was they were moser nefesh day and night, they were moser nefesh in [Yiddish comment], they are today sitting in the mizrach of the torah.  The ones who that used the other things, most of them are not even frum today. Its coming from the sitrah achra, its coming from the other place.  So a person would know, the right thing is what I’m saying. [another short grabled comment] 
                                                            4.  Look at yourself. Make yourself the growth. Like I was saying.  If you decide to be an echad, you will become RSBY. Hashem will take care of you.  If you do what everyone does, then you’re not successful.    You want to become sitting and  learning day and night, and to have like RSBY that everything will work out for you, then be an echad.  An echad is measured by bein hasedarim, an echad is measured after nach seder [!].  Elef nichnasim lacheder, vechad yotzei lehoraah. And everyone could have a thousand to echad – you could have a thousand echads [reference to the Mir?] and bezras Hashem, if a person will take himself and he will decide “I’m an echad” – “chazakeh holech lilmod naaseh gadol” – he’ll be the echad. The echad never judges what around him. Now is right to learn, I learn.  Now is right to be masmid, I’m a masmid.  Friday, shabbes.  Think - R Shteinmen will stand near you, you stay here? No!  you know the echad would not do that [something about standing for R Shteinman, and not standing is not the echad]. 
   a. I’m scared. A lot of times people come over to me and I send them out to work. Normally I tell the guy to come back tomorrow,
I daven that Hashem will give me the right decision, but then I answer him and I tell him I have to understand. [something about coming to shamayim and being asked what one did – and answering “a broker” “mortgages”, something tovel vesheretz b’yado] but if he is an echad, I tell him to stay.    
   b.      I tell you – this week, I got ten phone calls, I especially counted.  10 people asked me what to do. And six of them I told to go to work [seems like with a brachah for success but garbled], and the other four called me up a year after it, and [something about money]. So I asked him again. And one I saw was not an echad. So I told him out to work. The other 3 called me, I didn’t call them back yet – I had a busy weekend, but they left me a message. Everyone of them is magid shiur. Got the last message Friday afternoon. The echad – Hashem takes care. Every time! Sometimes I’m wrong in the decision, is he the echad, is he R. Yishmael or RSBY.  [Ends on a reference to lots of people going to meron, so he hopes many are like RSBY].]]></description>

Chayim Volozhiner said every soldier that gets killed in Eretz Yisrael goes straight to gan eden.  He was moser nefesh for yidden.  But again, our hashkafah is we want you to stay beis medrish, we want you to sit and learn.  We..the frum [?] people are the smallest army in this country.  We need a lot a more soldiers to …that Hashem will give us Eretz Yisrael good.  We are the soldiers that are keeping klal yisrael.  They are also saving. A’vaide. So we owe hakoros hatov to the people protecting us.  They owe US hakoros hatov for learning.  Our hashkafah is kol haolam lo nivrah ele<br />
bishvil torah.  So what we are doing is more from what they are doing.  This is our hashkafah.   But it never takes away from the other hashkafah.<br />
  h.      Now why are we busy the whole time with torah and not with hakoros hatov to the soldiers, to the policemen, to the government?  Because in the end, to learn, I want to tell you one thing. I know most of you will disagree with me but I’m telling you for myself – to learn sometimes is hard.    I know for you its easy. You’re young….But it happens.  A nisayon.  Not to learn is easy.  A’vaide to fight is hard, to be moser nefesh is hard, to be a soldier is hard.  But when a person finds learning to be hard sometimes, you would think on the other side would be easier.  I was never on the other side, so I can’t tell you.   We have to mechazek our side, our learning.  We have to [garbled about the yetzer pushing someone not to learn] so we speak about how much you have to do it.  But it doesn’t mean to take away from the other side.<br />
                                                         i.      I’ll give one more example – some people took a recording in my name and they felt that what I said about mesiras nefesh for<br />
the torah, to learn day and night, that the mesiras nefesh we spoke about was &#8211; like the chasmonayim were moser nefesh for torah, a person has to be moser nefesh for torah.   So again, what is the message?  The message is that even thought its VERY hard to learn, you have to do it. Every generation has its mesiras nefesh.   One generation’s was that they didn’t let physically to learn, and our generation’s mesiras nefesh that a person has to give is that all the friends go to trips and he stays and learns.  He has bad roommates that have (baruch Hashem in our yeshiva we don’t have it) they have advisors  not to use them. Its hard to be mesiras<br />
nefesh.   In our generation, Hashem is not asking us, expecting us, and we’re not in a generation that we have to do things.  Our mesiras nefesh is to sit and learn day and night.   In our generation, a person is not allowed to come and say “Uh! Some people are not learning, I will do something today. I will use the violin, I will hit, I will scream.”  We are talmidim of Rav Shteinman, and this is<br />
his hashkafah.   In our generation the job is to sit and learn, that’s all. The nisayon by us is electronic nisayon.  It’s a nisayon in the street, it’s a nisayon of what will be with me, what will come out of me. That, here you have to be strong.  Chas veshalom for<br />
person to think that he’s allowed to or he has to, we’re not allowed to and asked to and would not be appreciate and to be just assur and disgusting if a person goes and hits and does [?] to a person who is not learning but who is disturbing him.  In our generation, you know who disturbing you, it’s the yetzer harah. He’ll tell you to stop to learn.  Fight with him. Push him away. Again, what we speak of mesiras nefesh for torah, its mesiras NEFESH for torah.  So we speak out our job. We bring out the koach of mesiras nefesh le-torah.  But about in our generation we don’t mean that we have to do something.  And I’ll tell you something.  I saw in my life the guy that taught the way mesiras nefesh is physically – I never saw them becoming talmidei chachamim.  The guy that mesiras nefesh for torah by them was they were moser nefesh day and night, they were moser nefesh in [Yiddish comment], they are today sitting in the mizrach of the torah.  The ones who that used the other things, most of them are not even frum today. Its coming from the sitrah achra, its coming from the other place.  So a person would know, the right thing is what I’m saying. [another short grabled comment]<br />
                                                            4.  Look at yourself. Make yourself the growth. Like I was saying.  If you decide to be an echad, you will become RSBY. Hashem will take care of you.  If you do what everyone does, then you’re not successful.    You want to become sitting and  learning day and night, and to have like RSBY that everything will work out for you, then be an echad.  An echad is measured by bein hasedarim, an echad is measured after nach seder [!].  Elef nichnasim lacheder, vechad yotzei lehoraah. And everyone could have a thousand to echad – you could have a thousand echads [reference to the Mir?] and bezras Hashem, if a person will take himself and he will decide “I’m an echad” – “chazakeh holech lilmod naaseh gadol” – he’ll be the echad. The echad never judges what around him. Now is right to learn, I learn.  Now is right to be masmid, I’m a masmid.  Friday, shabbes.  Think &#8211; R Shteinmen will stand near you, you stay here? No!  you know the echad would not do that [something about standing for R Shteinman, and not standing is not the echad].<br />
   a. I’m scared. A lot of times people come over to me and I send them out to work. Normally I tell the guy to come back tomorrow,<br />
I daven that Hashem will give me the right decision, but then I answer him and I tell him I have to understand. [something about coming to shamayim and being asked what one did – and answering “a broker” “mortgages”, something tovel vesheretz b’yado] but if he is an echad, I tell him to stay.<br />
   b.      I tell you – this week, I got ten phone calls, I especially counted.  10 people asked me what to do. And six of them I told to go to work [seems like with a brachah for success but garbled], and the other four called me up a year after it, and [something about money]. So I asked him again. And one I saw was not an echad. So I told him out to work. The other 3 called me, I didn’t call them back yet – I had a busy weekend, but they left me a message. Everyone of them is magid shiur. Got the last message Friday afternoon. The echad – Hashem takes care. Every time! Sometimes I’m wrong in the decision, is he the echad, is he R. Yishmael or RSBY.  [Ends on a reference to lots of people going to meron, so he hopes many are like RSBY].</p>

		<description><![CDATA[But halakhah prohibits assuming the worst of another.


Despite that, I find the retraction unsatisfying. Hey, I&#039;m only human -- just because I&#039;m obligated to judge others charitably doesn&#039;t mean I always can.

Let&#039;s take a clearer case: A professor at Colombia Univ tells his class that Hitler had the right idea. How he explained this to his son, and was so proud as his little preschooler hunted around the house for Zyklon B that he just had to tell the next cabbie he used.

Later he explains that he was just illustrating his mentor&#039;s hyperbolic comparison of Jews to roaches. That neither he nor his mentor meant it literally, and in fact the illustration is a fictional story. That it&#039;s about getting rid of the cheapskate within.

If it were up to you, would you continue employing this professor, or is his apology insufficient?


The difference between the two cases is magnitude, not kind.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rav Nissim said that the problem was not what he said, but that his words were misinterpreted by those who don&#039;t know &quot;the yeshiva language.&quot; 


The problem was that the recording got out to those unfamiliar with that language.


This is strange.


Wasn&#039;t the lynchpin of that shmooze his having said the whole thing over to a random taxi driver?


Why would he himself -- according to his own telling -- say this to a taxi driver if, also according to Rav Nissim, only those within the yeshiva world understand it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; Rabbi Kaplan explained that the meaning of his hyperbolic statement was that the students should wage war with their yetzer hara. The real battle is not against the secular government or non-Orthodox Jews. It’s the internal battle of wills against oneself. 

Right. Just like the Muslims who say that Jihad, which literally means “struggle,” refers primarily to the internal struggle everyone has to do the right thing.

We wouldn’t accept this sort of explanation from a mullah who called for infidels to be killed, and I don’t see why we should accept it from Rabbi Kaplan.

His apology, such as it was, sounds exactly like something one of my kids would say when they’re caught doing something wrong: 

“I didn’t do it!”

“I just saw you do it.”

“I didn’t mean to! I was just joking!” (Followed by tears when they realize they’re not going to get away with it.)

It’s great that he’s encouraging his students to show gratitude, but is it sincere, or meant for our (that is, the wider world’s) consumption?]]></description>
