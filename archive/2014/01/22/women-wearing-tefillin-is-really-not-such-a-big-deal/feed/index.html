		<description><![CDATA[What should be censured is the methodology.  Citing gender inequality as a rational for circumscribing the halachic process will only weaken Jewish orthodoxy, not strength it.  One can validate the girl&#039;s feelings and still be critical of the halachic decision.  P.S. Why only &#039;to a certain degree?&#039;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, but not at the expense of methodology.  The Rema, the Gra, the Mishnah Berurah and the Aruch HaShulchan discourage woman wearing tefillin.  No major posek has endorsed the practice and for a school principle to act contrary to established teaching is simply not the way normative halachah is decided.  The concern is not with the social or cultural consequences of woman publicly wearing tefillin but with the promoting of an unhealthy autonomy in legal decision making.   Normative halachah has historically depended on a hierarchy of halachic authority and legal precedent, neither of which were evidenced in this matter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I apologize for the late response but I&#039;m not on the internet as much as I should be...

Your whole argument is faulty. You could the president of the RCA and the rabbi of the largest Orthodox congregation in the world and the number of women you would have spoken to would still be a drop in the ocean. You claim that men &#038; women are equal in the eyes of Torah Yiddishkeit. Fine, that&#039;s your opinion. But the fact that we say a bracha &quot;sheh lo asani Isha&quot; means the Chachmim disagree you with you. That doesn&#039;t mean that women &quot;deserve&quot; to do all the mitzvot that HaShem commanded that men do, but your being awfully cheeky saying with certainty that men &#038; women are equal. Even if it wasn&#039;t for Birchot HaShachar, if enough women who are B&#039;not Torah disagree with you (even if you haven&#039;t personally spoken with them), then it just isn&#039;t true.

And Cohanim and Yisroaelim are definitely are not equal. I will never be able to do the Avodah in the Beit HaMikdash (beemharah b&#039;yamenu). Cohanim are held to a higher level of kidusha, even today. So we aren&#039;t equal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again, Eliyahu, I can respond to your individual bullet points, but what would that accomplish? The first ten words of your last paragraph says it all. Mutatis mutandis (like they used to say) arguing further would be like arguing about the merits of religion,, when one person believes in God and the other doesn&#039;t. Frankly, knowing this now your position makes no sense at all. If, as you state, &quot;feminism is great&quot;, you shouldn&#039;t be writing tepidly of tolerating or understanding a girl who wants to wear tefillin - you should be shouting your full support as shrill as you can. Seriously, you ought to be putting oranges on your seder plate, and wearing empathy pouches on your belly, all day and every day. No half-way measures.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the contrary, &quot;mochin&quot; is stronger than &quot;assur&quot;!



Look at SA OH 608:2 where both &quot;ein mochin&quot; and &quot;mochin&quot; are used to refer to forbidden actions. In the case of &quot;ein mochin&quot; our justification for not protesting is &quot;better that they sin unintentionally than intentionally&quot;. But in the case of &quot;mochin&quot;, the violation is so severe that we cannot allow that, we must prevent them.


Also look at SA OH 616:2 where we say &quot;mochin&quot; when somebody is endangering their life.
And the Rama is not just &quot;an opinion&quot;. When not contradicted by Ashkenazi achronim, his is generally considered to be the definitive opinion for Ashkenazi psak. In particular, there are cases where the Rama represents a lenient minority opinion on which we rely. If we are to accept those leniencies and also permit tefillin to Ashkenazi women, then we come under the gemara&#039;s principle that &quot;one who relies on the leniencies of Beit Shammai and the leniencies of Beit Hillel is called evil.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It may be my subjective view, but I think we can all agree that there is a spectrum of what American society would call manliness, with rough and tough, strong, Arnold Schwarzennegar-like men on one end, and effeminate, sissy and somewhat flamboyant on the other end.  In American culture, there is a generally accepted middle point in which most men fall which prevents them from being labeled effeminate.  While no one has to conform to my version of manhood, what I have found from most women is that they are looking for a man who is a strong and manly, or who at the very least falls in this middle range on the manliness spectrum.  And what I am saying is that based on my experience in both the frum and secular worlds, and based on every single male interaction I have ever had in my life, I think I have developed somewhat of a sense of what is considered to be that middle zone of manliness for most men.  


However, after going to YU and seeing many Modern Orthodox men who have gone through the entire MO schooling system--as well as those baal teshuvas who perhaps try to emulate these MO men--I can tell you in my opinion MO men are more effeminate than the general population.  I have spoken about this with a number of people, mainly those who have not grown up solely in the MO world, and I believe every single one of them agreed that there is something more effeminate and different about MO men.  Sure rightwing men also have some effeminate men.  But in the MO world it is much more widespread in my opinion.  I don&#039;t know where it comes from, or who these men are trying to emulate and who their role models were growing up.  But when that woman complained of &quot;metro-sexual mama&#039;s boys&quot; I think she hit it on the head.  If you really have absolutely no idea what I am talking about, then maybe its because you were perhaps a part of that system and it blinds you from seeing the differences.  Regardless, if you don&#039;t believe me, there are many people I know you could talk with who would agree with me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Divorce: So it&#039;s better for women to stay in unhappy marriages?


Cooking: Men know how to cook too. And drive.


Birth Rate: There is no rule that states that we must have X amount of children so that you can collect Social Security. You want to take the choice about bearing children away from women so that you can get Social Security?!


Merit: I don&#039;t believe that any schools have gender quotas and if they did it would be illegal.


When women can do man things, men won&#039;t do them: Post hoc ergo propter hoc. There are many reasons why men might not participate in reform services. But do you think that women should not own land? Or vote? Have men stopped owning land or voting?


Look, you think feminism is terrible. I think it&#039;s great. I don&#039;t see how or why men should dictate women&#039;s roles. How about this? Women can choose the kind of life they want to live and men can choose theirs. Giving one group domination over the other requires justification. There is none.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What is the harm that feminism has caused in the secular world? I can hardly believe you wrote that. It is no coincidence that the divorce rate began to climb higher and higher the moment Title VII laws enforcing feminism were enacted. And that is just those who actually ever get married.  There are today, proportionately, more single women in the country than any other time in its history (other than in war.) Marriage has become very difficult for many, with nobody knowing their roles any more. Who&#039;s going to drive, who&#039;s going to prepare dinner, etc ad nauseum.  And even whey get married, so many of the women, for &quot;career&quot; reasons either forego child rearing or postpone till they can only have one. This destruction of the basic family unit has not only eroded the moral fiber of the country, but its causing devastating economic problems, mainly down the road with social security, where there not enough children being born to propagate the system
 And I have not even addressed the social problems caused by forced equalization of school resources under Title IX, the move of the economy to a paper-pusher one to accommodate females, and much more. Nor have I spoken of how its effected the Jewish community, such as the Reform movement, where many studies have shown that men stop attending the moment women become rabbis. Nor have I spoken of how the old fashioned concept of actual &quot;merit&quot; as a measurement of achievement has been dropped in everything from college acceptance to scholarship to awards to job promotions, in the name of &quot;gender quality.&quot; It would take a thick book to even begin to address the ills directly attributable to feminism.  What harm has feminism caused? How can that even be asked?
Let me say this - if you believe feminism is wonderful, then really we have nothing to talk about. Your opinions are a little wishy-washy, but coming from where you&#039;re coming from, they make sense. I just find it hard to accept you can believe such a thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it was particularly nice, open-minded, or called for to only respond &quot;Wow&quot; to another commenter. You did not lay out an argument as you are now advising me to do. Perhaps his opinion is not your cup of tea, but saying that women laying tefillin isn&#039;t a big deal rubs plenty of people the wrong way as well.


This will be a very abridged version of my POV. We do not recite the blessing citing creation after the birth of a child, but under the chuppah in recognition that the union of a man and a woman represents the ideal human being. This can only be so if each is uniquely different, with specific masculine and feminine traits. Traditional Judaism acknowledges these differences and allows men and women to fulfill their potential in their respective roles. Due to time constraints, I am unable to delve into all the instances this is made clear by the Sages, but to be honest, anyone familiar with the Talmud should not be surprised by my opinion. Instead, I have two bottom lines: One, I trust the Sages. I trust in the accuracy of the Oral Torah. If one is going to accuse the Rabbis of bias or misogyny, how do they trust the rulings on other matters and thus consider themselves Orthodox? Two, as MO, I am in the world but not of it. I engage with the modern world but I do not take my cues from it. I do not regard it as a coincidence that so many of these issues have arisen after feminism. Given the major branding problem of that movement and the fact that secularism hardly offers women empowerment, I refuse to believe that Orthodoxy has &quot;catching up&quot; to do or should emulate the secular world in any way when it pertains to gender relations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I tried to address your concerns in this very post. What are your actual concerns? What is behind these floodgates? And what is the harm that feminism has caused in the secular world? You just make too many assumptions to take your comment seriously.


Also, not sure what the LGBT article has to do with this. You mischaracterized everything that I said there. Perhaps it would help if you read it again. Unless when you say &quot;Accept&quot; you mean &quot;acknowledge, and provide love and support&quot; because that is all I ever said.]]></description>

Bekitzur, my post was addressed to R.E. Fink (not you) who went to an excellent yeshivah and should know better.

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s not the right question.

There are two questions here, and you confused the two of them by being too simplistic.

1) Is it permitted if done for the wrong reasons? - The answer is &quot;No.&quot;

2) Is it permitted if done for the right reasons? - The answer is &quot;Yes.&quot;

So the only real question is &quot;What are their reasons?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So orthodoxy should accept homosexuals with open arms (as per your previous post) and now orthodoxy should accept girls wearing tefillin. You&#039;re amazing. You just don&#039;t seem to see how A leads to B, sure as night follows day. Again, you&#039;re not using the wide angle lens, and consequently you&#039;re not seeing the broader picture. As we in the legal profession well know, some things are judged on a case by case basis, and others are treated with a bright-line rule. It&#039;s not, in the latter cases, that the law is stupid (though often it can be.) It&#039;s not that it doesn&#039;t understand &quot;nuance.&quot;  It&#039;s that the law recognizes on some issues you cannot get down into the weeds of individual cases, because of the impact the individual cases will have on society as a whole.


And that, my dear friend, who I remember well from many years ago, is why older and wiser people do not speak of &quot;tolerance&quot;, when it comes to girls putting on tefilling. It&#039;s not just that, as I&#039;ve written elsewhere, &quot;tolerance&quot; is an excuse for the weak and wobbly, folks without a backbone. It is that, but also that in today&#039;s times, 2014, one has to draw bright line rules around feminist issues. Not be &quot;tolerant&quot; of it. Not try to &quot;analyze&quot; it. But reject it. Without malevolence, but simply and unambiguously, reject it. The moment you deviate from the bright line, you open the floodgates to allow the forces of feminism -  that have already proved so destructive of general society - into our own little orthodox world. Posts like this might get you accolodaes from the far left, but it will eventually take you away from your roots, to the Weiss-Halivni land of contrarianism and mutually-exclusive friends and shul-mates.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It does not matter if I am an Orthodox man or woman.  The only thing that would matter at all is if I have spoken to many Orthodox women in regard to equality.  And you are making a huge assumption that I have not spoken to numerous women in this regard, or that I have not served as a rabbi and counselor in a shul in any capacity.  So no, it actually doesn&#039;t matter if I am a man or woman.   

And if you want to get technical, the phrase &quot;for all intents and purposes&quot; can be used to mean &quot;&#039;it isn&#039;t actually true but it it so close to being so that we may proceed as though it is&#039;&quot; or &quot;for the most part.&quot;  So yes, in everyday Jewish living, modern Orthodox women for the most part have the same rights as men do, just as Jewish men and Cohanim for the most part have the same rights although there are some differences.  I don&#039;t consider whether one can put on teffillin or separate challah, or lights shabbos candles, or go to mikveh, or have a bris as being of such huge import that these differences would be defined as not having equal rights.  As a whole, in social and communal interactions, they have equal rights, with some small differences.

And I really do wish my post was satire.]]></description>

As the author of the article says in the very first sentence, &quot;a growing number of women and girls in the Orthodox Jewish community are interested in wearing tefillin publicly.&quot;  We know the Reform and Conservative movements exist, and we know their *stated* reasons to encourage tefillin wearing are for egalitarian reasons that have no relevance in halacha.

		<description><![CDATA[Except that the girls who are wearing t&#039;fillin are not the ones announcing that they are wearing t&#039;fillin. It was a blog that follows a different school who heard about it, asked the principal and he said he had allowed it. They then asked the principal of the school that the blog normally reports on and he said he would allow it as well. So men are the ones announcing this, not the girls. And yet the girls&#039; desire to wear t&#039;fillinis being attacked. Huh?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I say that hardly anything would change for them, I mean that as a whole, women will not be any freer or have any more noticeable advantages in social interactions and society within the Jewish world with these small changes.And regardless if certain individuals find some meaning in these activities, I have to ask if it is really worth it to cause such a fight and schism in Judaism and risk being labeled outside of Orthodoxy all for the sake of trying to break with the accepted mores of Orthodox Jewish life.  If men began pushing that they should light shabbos candles instead of their wives I would be against that too. In the end, most movements that tried to change too many things too quickly in Orthodoxy eventually went off the deep end and lost everything.  The sages made fences and rulings for a reason and they should not be lightly dismissed without a very necessary reason to do so.  There is so much spirituality in Judaism, and rabbinic precedent should not have to be trampled upon in order to find the spirituality and meaning that women throughout the ages have already discovered long ago.  And even if a few individuals believe they can only find a bit more meaning with tefillin alone (as opposed to a feminist agenda and a desire to get the kavod as well), it is not worth this fight and all the trouble it will cause in the end.   

As for taking away your manhood, I am not talking specifically about you.  I am talking about modern Orthodox men in general.  Anyone who grows up in the system may not see it.  But many people coming from outside of modern Orthodoxy can see that there is something different about many modern Orthodox men (I&#039;m not saying all Orthodox men, or even the majority, necessarily).  When you compare their interactions in Orthodox society and in relationships, and you compare that to the wider American culture, there is definitely a noticeable difference.

I&#039;ll end with the words of noted feminist lesbian Camille Paglia. Her words ring true in the modern Orthodox world as well, in my opinion, perhaps even more so.  &quot;This PC gender politics thing—the way gender is being taught in the universities—in a very anti-male way, it&#039;s all about neutralization of maleness.&quot; The result: Upper-middle-class men who are &quot;intimidated&quot; and &quot;can&#039;t say anything. . . . They understand the agenda.....Politically correct, inadequate education, along with the decline of America&#039;s brawny industrial base, leaves many men with &quot;no models of manhood,&quot; she says. &quot;Masculinity is just becoming something that is imitated from the movies. There&#039;s nothing left. There&#039;s no room for anything manly right now.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand that the questions were said to you, but I think the more relevant point that is being made is that most of those reporting negatively on the tefillin &quot;issue&quot; have not reported on these men&#039;s issues that happen. (Perhaps it is because they are much more common and not because of the male/female difference).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;If I want to keep chalav yisrael not because I believe it is required, but because it makes me feel superior to those who drinks chalav stam, should I?&quot;

No, you should not.

&quot;Am I better off giving 10% of my income in tzedakah anonymously, or is it ok tog ive more publicly because I desire kavod?&quot;

Yes, you are better off giving it anonymously (that&#039;s actually clear halacha that it&#039;s always better to give tzedaka anonymously).

&quot;Why is it the case that women&#039;s motivations are always subject to question whereas men&#039;s rarely are?&quot;

They certainly are, men do things for the wrongs reasons all the time and they, likewise, should not.  This is also a red herring because I never said or implied anything to the contrary.

&quot;Have you ever seen someone suggest that the majority of men who wear Rabbenu Taam tefillin are doing it for the wrong reasons?&quot;

Yes, I have.  Again, this is another red herring.

&quot;Finally, you didn&#039;t raise the concern that women should do all mandatory mitzvot perfectly before moving on to optional mitzvot.&quot;

Correct, I did not.  I don&#039;t think perfection is really an appropriate level to expect from anyone.]]></description>
