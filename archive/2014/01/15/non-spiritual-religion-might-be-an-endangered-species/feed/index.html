		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know about this whole &quot;two main groups of religious people&quot; idea. It sounds like both of the types you&#039;re describing adhere to halacha because of what it does for them personally. I think (hope) that there are significant numbers of people whose primary reason for keeping mitzvot is to לתקן עולם במלכות ש-די, no?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;  It seems that the more atheism and rejection of God our world experiences, the more we see an increased interest in more spiritual forms of religion. It makes perfect sense. If there is a fear that too much rational or scientific thinking might lead people to atheism, it stands to reason that religions will prefer to focus on their more spiritual sides.


That&#039;s part of it. The rest is that as our understanding of the world increases, there is less room for religion as something grounded in the real world.


To use an example I&#039;ve mentioned here before: Once upon a time, Jews really believed that dough started to rise eighteen minutes after flour and water mixed. An eighteen-minute old mixture being chometz was just a metzius. Now we know that yeast can&#039;t tell time, and we need a different explanation. Inevitably, the explanation is mystical/spiritual.]]></description>
