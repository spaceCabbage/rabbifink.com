		<description><![CDATA[Just to clarify, when you write that the words of chazal are not divine, does that imply that if we disagree with a halachic ruling of tanaaim or amoraim, or if we deem their opinion unfair, immoral, or unjust, that we may disregard their ruling and follow our own opinion?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always thought of American law as a decent metaphor for explaining to outsiders. When someone is appointed as a judge and makes a judgement, that law stays on the books-- even if you personally don&#039;t like the judge, even if the law was passed a hundred years ago and you think it doesn&#039;t adequately address the needs of today, whatever other excuses you might apply. unless a judge with equal or greater authority overturns the law or finds a different way of applying it, you have to follow it. If you are not a judge you can&#039;t change the law of the land even if you are a citizen, even a well-educated one. American laws don&#039;t have an expiration date on them.
Not a perfect metaphor but addresses the question of why we still follow older laws.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi, there is nothing I find particularly objectionable about what you wrote but there is an issue that I think needs to be addressed.  While Chazal were by no means divine or perfect, Orthodox Judaism generally accepts that they had a certain jurisprudential authority that allowed them to make Gazerot that are still in effect today.  This issue seems particularly vexing for those challenged in their faith.  For example, I was trying to explain to a friend why a Jew must introduce the microbial rennet into hard cheeses even if you know 100% that the ingredients are kosher.  The fact that Chalzal made a gezera was not particularly compelling.  I have had the same difficulty explaining why wine vinegar needs to be kosher.  At the end of the day we need to simultaneously deal with fallibility and authority.  I find it a difficult conversation to have with people who have their doubts about Halacha in General and Kashrut restrictions in particular. ]]></description>

On a personal level and to preserve your sanity, I would add that it&#039;s quite possible that for every person you&#039;re supposedly turning away, you&#039;re being mekarev two people who are strengthened by seeing how an observant person can remain both observant and rational.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you please clarify your position when you think a Gadol made a mistake and not toy our sensibilities or logic do you submit to it and think I don&#039;t understand it but the Gadol obviously has a good reason and I&#039;ll think it through.. Or do you automatically brush it aside and say oh that Gadol is not infallible and I&#039;ll dismiss it and the Rabbi is not as smart as me. It makes a big difference in your perspective. Can you please clarify?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I suspect that most of the people that reduce their observance* are only using what they read as an excuse for that reduction of observance. It&#039;s simple human nature; When you do something that deep down you believe to be wrong, you look for external things that can &quot;excuse&quot; you from having done it. &quot;Not my fault&quot; syndrome.


* I am NOT including people that read things and lose their entire belief in anything supernatural. That&#039;s an entirely different case.]]></description>
