		<description><![CDATA[If I had a nickel every time a writer tried to portray a black athlete - that everybody views as lazy or undisciplined - as smart and talented and this and that, I&#039;d probably have a good 50 to 55 cents. It&#039;s just a kneejerk from of affirmative action that&#039;s become ingrained in a lot of public school graduates.
You say he doesn&#039;t &quot;owe us a basketball career.&quot; No, but what he does owe is millions of dollars, back to the teams he stole money from,  under the false promise that he would actually play the game.
