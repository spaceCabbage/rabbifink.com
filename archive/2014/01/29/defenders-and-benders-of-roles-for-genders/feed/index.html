		<description><![CDATA[It depends what you mean by feminism.  Equity feminists (feminism&#039;s first wave) are principally concerned with equal opportunity in work and education.  Gender feminists (contemporary feminism) are concerned with promoting the idea that men and woman are basically the same (they see gender as a social construct).  The current debate about feminism is concerned with the second ideology.   


You can see this distinction in the world of Orthodox Judaism.  Expanding woman&#039;s participation in prayer and ritual is problematic for two reasons. 1) There is little legal precedent (unlike woman&#039;s education) and 2) Prayer, more than learning, is seen as the more basic expression of our fundamental nature.  It will be different for men and woman.   Contemporary critics of feminism are concerned with gender feminism which sees in every social inequality the evidence of sexism and discrimination.   Why should combating this idea should be perceived as a threat to Orthodoxy&#039;s future?  


Here&#039;s another question for you.  Assuming you believe that gender is not the consequence of social conditioning, where do you think this difference is appropriately reflected in Jewish life?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Every society believes that there are differences between men and women but they don&#039;t agree on what those differences are.  In one society, only women can farm yams and in another, women are forbidden to farm yams.  In Christianity, women were not allowed to own property yet Jewish women have always been allowed to own property.  Jewish women are not obligated to pray (at least, under Ashkenazi commentators) but they are obligated in the same prayers as men under Islam.  And everything -- everything -- is explained as &quot;well, there are differences between men and women&quot;.
Ovadia Yosef does not permit women to bless mitzvot that are not obligated, but he does require women to say the Shemonah Esrei twice daily.  Ashkenazic commentators hold differently -- a woman who performs mitzvot that are not obligated is praiseworthy and we have a long standing custom of not requiring women to pray.  The ruling on tefillin for these particular girls at that particular school is part of that tradition.  It is no different than allowing women to bless the sukkah or the arba minim or say the brachot for the shema.
Yes, the Torah has different religious roles.  The Torah permits a woman to be married through bi&#039;ah and does not require a ketubah but the Rabbis overturned this and forbid the first and required the second.  Were they feminists?  Radicals?  After all, marriage through bi&#039;ah is in the Torah, right there, in print.
Even if you believe that G-d proscribed different roles for men and women, you can still have a legitimate argument about whether women should be allowed to drive cars, work outside the home with men, learn the Hebrew language, learn Talmud, or walk between two courtyards by way of an alley with her hair partially covered.  These are all topics for discussion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that train has already run.  Haven&#039;t your read all those wonderful apologetics about how women are naturally more spiritual than men and how they don&#039;t need all those extra mitzvot and how their souls are different from mens and more refined, etc.
Do you think anyone was writing that stuff before the 19th century?  It&#039;s *all* a reaction to feminism.  The only reason anyone spends time on all that beautiful poetry is to essentially cover up the fact that women have significantly less power in every area of life in halacha.
As long as women and men continue to have equality in the secular world and Orthodox Jews continue to embrace that and benefit from that, they are going to have to answer the question of why something that is good in society is not good for the Jews.  They can answer with poetry or prose or apologetics or anger, but *not* answering the question is no longer an option.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[According to Chazal and according to the values held dear by most Orthodox Jews, an ideal society would not have one set of social rules determined by the larger non-Jewish culture and one set of rules for religious practice.  And ideal society would be governed by halacha.
In that society, women would not be judges or lawyers and they would have no input at all over the laws that controlled their lives, except possibly as petitioners.  Women would not serve in government, lest they hold authority over men.  Women might not learn to read (it was radical in the 19th century).  Women might not drive (some Chassidic sects disallow it).  They would not learn in the same schools with men nor would men and women interact socially or professionally.  Specific modesty codes could easily be added to the legal code.
This is halachic society -- not the mixed-bag we live with where the general norms of life are feminist and halacha is quaintly confined to the Orthodox synagogue.  Gender inequality and gender separation is deeply rooted in halacha.  The black-hats in Israel are not making things up.  Can you seek a way to permit such and such?  Of course you can.  May things can be permitted, if you need a reason to permit them.  But in an *ideal* society, why would you do so?  Large numbers of Charedi Israelis are asking themselves that question.  
I don&#039;t want to throw a damper on the MO march of progress, which I very much cheer from the sidelines.  I admire the way MO Jews are slowly and thoughtfully engaging these issues.  But to me, worrying about tefillin is a sign of not taking halacha very seriously.  Because halacha is not a system for running a synagogue service.  It is a system for running a society.  Those who take halacha seriously should worry about bigger issues, like whether an ideal halachic society would look more like our lives here or more like Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Most MOs have no desire to live in Iran in terms of gender issues but instead of facing down all the ways that 12th and 16th and even 19th century legal codes actually envision exactly that society, they&#039;ve made a deal.  Secular society will provide them with equality, personal freedom, etc. and halacha will remain pure, if confined to the walls of the Orthodox synagogue.  I don&#039;t have the answer;  I do admire you for engaging the challenge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s the entirety of argument? The view that a male &quot;slave&quot; was able to do more work in the temple and was therefore worth more is an example to you of the Torah seeing women as being inferior to men?


Must be why God instructed Moses to approach the women first with the Torah, right?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mike - I&#039;ve never heard of a single case of anything you&#039;re talking about, and I daven in very traditional, nusach sefard, European shul, which (unfortunately, in my opinion but that&#039;s a different story) also has a lot of Lakewood guys. The rabbis don&#039;t tell the men how their wives should behave, no one tried to throw a woman out of the ezras nashim (the rare time a woman shows up, the men upstairs just go downstairs) and I&#039;ve never heard of a rabbi of any stripe, let alone one in charge of the mikvah, refusing to talk to a woman. You say this is &quot;antecdotal.&quot; If they happened at all, these incidents are outliers and not relevant.
As for your defense of the stubborn  facts of Arachin - you&#039;re reaching, my friend. 50 to 30. That&#039;s the Torah&#039;s viewpoint. QED.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Archin&quot; is not &quot;worth,&quot; that is &quot;damim&quot; which is a different category of vow.  In particular, Archin can&#039;t be value because it is a fixed some depending only on age and gender and not individual ability.  Damim are assessed by individual market value (when there were slave markets.) 

I would add, based on personal anecdotal experience, that Orthodox women are often driven to seek more acitve ritual roles when they feel they are not being taken seriously as independent, intelligent adults.  For example, when rabbis tell men how they should have their wives behave, or when the Rav hamachshir of a mikveh won&#039;t talk to women who complain about how they are treated but insist that they go through another rabbi, or some man tries to throw them out of the women&#039;s section of shul during a weekday minyan because he feels like davening there rather than in the men&#039;s section.  Those who wish to preserve a strong distinction in ritual might help their cause by being careful how they treat women in non-ritual situations.]]></description>

That&#039;s no &quot;da&#039;at yachid&quot;, that&#039;s Bible. You cannot get around it.

		<description><![CDATA[I see. So the Bach and Maharshal are &quot;da&#039;at yachid&quot;, but the Aruch Hashulchan isn&#039;t. Okaaaay....
You&#039;re just re-illustrating the point again that those looking for a way to excuse the feminists are just picking and choosing sources wildly. That&#039;s the type of &quot;approach&quot;, as it were, that the &quot;poskim&quot; of the conservatives used when they were still pretending to keep halahca, and look where it got them.
Anyway, for me personally, I don&#039;t view the matter from the point of view of halacha. For me its a very simple analysis. The evidence is already in, from fifty years of legally enforced feminism, and its been an unmitigated disaster. We orthodox Jews are not going to import a failed ideology into our ranks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I once chanced upon a blog posting about the controversy over women wearing tefillin, and some commenter posted on it: &quot;As I have observed before: Orthodoxy is not misogynistic, but there do seem to be a lot of misogynists in Orthodoxy.&quot;


So I thought she was saying that part of the opposition may be misogyny, but I suppose it is also possible that she just posts random unrelated things all over the place. 


If you think the latter is more likely, who am I to argue?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s something odd about that fact that you write an entire article and ignore the only important part of the issue. The reason for the opposition to religious feminism is that it is entirely incompatible with the Torah when accepted at face value and taken to its logical conclusion. 

The notion that the world is unfair if a woman cannot be a rabbi is undermined by the patent fact that a woman cannot be a witness--and yet G-d says that the world is fair. 

The notion that a woman needs to wear tefillin to achieve her spirituality is undermined by the patent fact that she does not have the other &quot;os&quot; of our relationship with Hashem either--and yet G-d says they can achieve spirituality. 

Thus, the only coherent philosophy of Judaism is that there are inherent differences between men and women, and that those differences are reflected in different religious roles. 

Since the entire orthodox feminist philosophy therefore makes no sense, the only sensible conclusion is that the people advocating it disagree with the rest of the fundamentals of Judaism also, and that their next step indeed is to insist on being witnesses on and on performing female genital mutilation.]]></description>

You know how people try to explain to those on the extreme right (like folks on Cross-Currents) how their hashkafot in certain areas are wrong and how it can do damage to either women or OTD kids or anyone else?, They tend to bring up all sorts of apologetics for why it is OK, or are just blind to it. They can&#039;t see it. They are entrenched. Well, if there were trying to emasculate boys, would YOU be able to spot it? Or is it possible you are bit entrenched yourself?

		<description><![CDATA[What do you mean &quot;allowing for less masculine males?&quot; I didn&#039;t say anybody is putting less masculine men out to pasteur. I said there is an active movement to eliminate what would become masculine as early as possible in boys. Masculinity is an enemy because of its potential violence and patriarchal tendencies. Whether it&#039;s by reeducation early on or that toys they are actively encouraged to play with or games they play in playgrounds. So if you are trying to blot out the distinctions that make male and females different than of course there it is going to connect to Judaism at some level.

&#062;No one is emasculating boys.


I think it is time to just a wee bit more self-examination of your side as you would expect from the right. 

&#062;My issue is with the extreme aversion and the conflation of that aversion with Torah.

Your issue is with the extreme only? So then you agree outside of extremist aversion, there is validity some of critiques?

&#062;However, there are some terrible consequences of too much manliness too.

There are no consequences to too much manliness, unless you are equating manliness with rape and violence, as is exactly the false equation that the book deals with which leads to all the things they try to do to boys growing up.]]></description>

Rather, boys that are not rough and tough are no longer being pressured into doing the stereotypical man activities. However, there are some terrible consequences of too much manliness too. Not sure why simply allowing for less masculine males is akin to neutering.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think, this is the problem that Liberal theology (both Jewish and Christian) traditionally has had to deal with. As they start using modern culture to define what the theology and ritual is going to be, they start seeing less and less of anything to hold on to. Yes, I am arguing a slippery slope here. This is not to say EVERYTHING is a slippery slope, but clearly, there are patterns you see in history.


This is not to say orthodoxy in all its guises doesn&#039;t have it&#039;s issues as well, but clearly this seems to be a problem with the idea of progressiveness.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Almost every single assertion of fact in this post is wrong or unsupported, but none more so than this one: &quot;it is entirely possible to be a staunch social gender roles progressive and be a religious gender roles traditionalist.&quot; 


You  WISH that was true.  And if you read your history, there were plenty of people in the nascent conservative movement in the first half of the 20th century who felt the same about social gender vs religions gender. And to a man (so to speak) they were dead wrong.  Bit by bit the mechitzas were lowered and lowered until they were removed altogether, culminating in the 1983 decision of JTS to ordain women. You PERSONALLY may be able to compartmentalize things in your brain, and say socially I approve of feminism, but not religiously. But what will you say when its argued to you that religion gender was predicated on the social gender of the time. If you think that today things have changed socially, how can you justify not changing religiously? And even if you can live with the internal contradictions, dont expect anyone else to buy it. 


This is another example of the intellectual inconsistency you are trying impossibly to stake out here. Before I commented that if you think feminism is so great, you ought to be letting your wife make kiddush for you (and dismissing the talmudic passage of this being an embarrassment as a product of a time where they weren&#039;t as smart as you are.) But this type of have your cake and think you can still eat it approach - like to many yeshivah graduates, it just doesn&#039;t work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for ignoring the substance of the comment. 


Ideally, I see no problem with girls toys and boys toys. I don&#039;t go buying my girls GI joe figures and I don&#039;t go buying American girls to my son. It&#039;s not going to happen. If he plays with his sisters, than he plays with his sisters. I&#039;m not going to tackle him. The question is, do people actively oppose the idea of there being boy and girls toys. That active opposition comes from a very clear hashkafa that only emanates from certain feminism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Finally, I don’t expect naturally conservative or traditionally minded people to just change their mind on feminism. But I do find the extreme aversion to the movement more than a bit disturbing.

It depends on what aspects the aversion is placed. Equal opportunity? A plus. Sameness between the sexes? Than no. I see no need to change my mind. A just finished reading a great book called &quot;The war on boys&quot; written by....a woman. And yes, she is a proud feminist in the sense of equal opportunity and fairness across the board. But she is honest that feminism deserves criticism as well as praise. Parts of her book is dedicating to the growing attitude to actively to de-masculate boys, especially among educators in public schools and playgrounds. Anything &quot;male&quot; is to be gut for fear these boys will be violent toward women in the future. In Mrs. Hoffs words, I see no reason to join the feminism bandwagon to neuter males. If you understand THAT aspect of feminism, then you can understand some of the aversion. I agree with you that there are extremes, and that should be avoided and I think for a good part, most are. I also know you are fair minded person....or at least always strive to be. Do you believe feminism deserves no criticism? Is is just praise?

&#062;Nor does the Torah require that boys play with tools and that girls play with My Little Pony.



You are narrowing the issue to the point of it being absurd. Nobody is saying that you quickly rush and remove a hammer from your daughters hands. But the torah clearly puts some demarcation between the two. And in order for this to exist, there has to BE sexes from the get go. And there are many within feminism that actively (not passively) deem to remove that demarcation anyway they can.]]></description>
