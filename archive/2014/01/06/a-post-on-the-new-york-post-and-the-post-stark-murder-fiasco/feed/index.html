		<description><![CDATA[Because you are attacking the Post for a sensationalist headline, when every day it prints sensationalist headlines.

 Because you suggest not supporting the Post, and write &quot;it doesn&#039;t belong in the home of  a God fearing Jew&quot; [but books and articles about the documentary hypotheses apparently do] when that paper has been unwavering in support of Israel. You are writing on the Internet. On any given day, on average, every single one of your readers will read and see things far worse than anything in the Post.  
 
Because you attack the Post for one story in poor taste, when you can devote the same efforts to attacking the New York Times, every day.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I respect you, but this post is ridiculous. The New York Times attacks both Israel and the values orthodox Jews hold dear, practically every day, and has been doing so for decades. Not only are its editorials left wing and hyper liberal, but its news reporting, both in what it covers and what is conveniently omits, is slanted and biased. The Post, by marked contrast, has consistently taken the pro-Israel position, year in and year out. It prints the stories the Times tries to ignore, and it features conservative writers the Times would hide from. One - that&#039;s 1 - sensationalist cover - i.e., the type of cover the Post puts on every single day -  doesn&#039;t change all that. The mere suggestion is laughably absurd.
Classic example of the golus mentality here, fecklessly trying to appease those who hate us. Instead of trying to attack the Post on the one occasion it bridles you, why not direct your ire the other 364 days of the year towards the New York Times?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[However I must agree about the NYPOST tastelessness. Which should not be surprising considering when it benefits ultra conservatives, they don&#039;t seem to mind. Like their taste when reporting on Arabs, Blacks, victims of police brutality, occupation, drone wedding bombs and so on. I&#039;m surprised that a Rabbi Fink can have a congregation in a very progressive part of the country and city, yet sound no different than his counterparts in the West Bank.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[According to several hundred violations in his buildings as well as testimony and buildings investigations he was indeed a slum lord. The article above should perhaps be up front not of his &quot;high roller&quot; status, but of his &quot;lowest of the low&quot; status. It is not how a man treats his family that we judge him, it is how he treats those he has no benefit in treating well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hear much about &quot;ample evidence&quot; but I haven&#039;t really seen any. What I have seen is 1) Sinas chinam 2) loshon harah 3) and a lot of what my father a&quot;H and my mother described to me as the inability of the European Jews to see the writing on the wall pre holocaust.  I am not denying the &quot;if it bleeds it leads&quot; mentality of the Post, nor the media whores in general, but to deny ANY element of anti semitism in the Post&#039;s treatment of this matter is dangerous naïveté. Go back and review the media treatment of Trayvon. They kept using his angelic childhood pictures, and never mentioned his history in drug use and theft. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So I read the article you referenced, line for line, and while it says much about drug dealers and other ne&#039;er do wells, it isn&#039;t much of an indictment of Mr. Stark. It does point out the inherent nature and appeal of S.R.O.s which are, by their very nature, low rent, single rooms a haven for the dregs of society (not the type btw who would exhibit any respect for their living quarters) how exactly is that an indictment of Mr Stark, a&quot;H. I am not saying he was not a slumlord, I just haven&#039;t seen compelling factual EVIDENCE. It certainly was not in that article. What you are implying then is that SROs can&#039;t have owners because it is a lose lose situation. The inhabitants of same will not respect their property enough to not trash them, and the owners will be condemned for not &quot;keeping them up&quot; ignoring the fact that it is an impossible task]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh nonsense. The Post doesn&#039;t sell more papers when they malign a Jew. It&#039;s a trash tabloid newspaper and EVERYONE is fair game (just do a google image search on NY Post covers). Unfortunately, Stark - not the Post - is the one that contributed to antisemitism by affirming so many of the negative stereotypes about Jews. &quot;Rumor inuendo&quot;? Please - there is ample evidence that he was a despicable man who cared nothing for people outside of his community. 

Yes, it is a horrible cover that displays an incredible lack of sensitivity. Yes, Stark certainly didn&#039;t deserve to be murdered for his crimes and my heart goes out to his family who lost a father and husband in a horrific way. But, yes, he also deserved to be put behind bars.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that the antisemitism is a bit subliminal but there. And it is true that we are overly sensitive to it, but not without good reason. Here is why I think it&#039;s antisemitic. how many murders in NY, make the front page, full cover? And in this case, they are maligning the VICTIM of the crime, not the murderer, but the murderee! Let us not lose sight of the fact that Menachem Stark, a&quot;H, committed no crime, nor was he convicted of any crime...he is a murder victim! But when you have such a nice colorful smiling picture of a Chasidic Jew, bam it is full page. Furthermore, why would the Post risk a libel suit, which clearly this cover should ignite, by labeling him a slumlord WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE, based upon rumor inuendo, or the simple fact that he is a landlord in NY. Without question the motive is to sell papers,(&quot;If it bleeds, it leads&quot;) but there must be some underlying antisemitism to rush to judgment (and press) without even a modicum of responsible journalism. I posit that the impetus for this IS the fact that they had a chance to do it with a glowing picture of a Chasidic Jew. I am not so sure they would have run such a cover with a average joe shmoe...are you? But maligning a Jew SELLS, and to deny that risks adopting the attitude of the pre nazi germany European Jews (as related to me by my holocaust surviving parents) who refused to read the writing on the walls, or on the front page of the Post as the case may be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not familiar with FailedMessiah.com (though I&#039;ve heard of it).  Regardless, that statement is anti-Semitic (anti a sect of Judaism, such as hassidim, is anti-Jews as a whole).  Nor is the 1st statement &quot;maybe just a little bit&quot; anti-Semitic;  when I read that, I got scared and felt I was reading some neo-Nazism.  Why are you trying so hard to make believe these aren&#039;t anti-Semitic?


There is nothing wrong with defending ourselves against anti-semitism.  It won&#039;t spur or create more anti-Semitism as you suggest (unless, or course, improper tactics are used), but awareness of a terrible problem and the means to get rid of it.   What&#039;s wrong with protesting and boycotting a publication if you find it offensive?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When tragedy strikes the Jewish people Haredi rabbis are quick to explain why it happened. A tsunami is caused by lashon hara. A fire by lack of tznius. Famine is due to Zumba. But in this case I have yet to hear what the Jewish people did wrong to warrant this punishment. Why? Perhaps because, as The Post intended to say, Stark was a horrible person who was heavily involved in illegal businesses and made the lives of anyone he deemed inferior completely miserable. Stark burned many people in his disgusting behavior. Never has a case of mida k&#039;negid mida been more apparent. 


There&#039;s an important lesson to be learned from all this and it has nothing to do with tabloid headlines or anti-semitism. It&#039;s simply that a Jew must act properly in business dealings. Even more so when doing business with gentiles. That&#039;s where the focus and outrage of the Jewish community should be. The NYPD will solve the murder crime. We have to solve all the others.]]></description>
