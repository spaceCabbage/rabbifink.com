		<description><![CDATA[&quot;the demands for very specific supplies.&quot;


And the supply lists seem to get longer and longer every year (I don&#039;t mean with the grades, I mean in the same grade with successive children). Many schools have also collectivized the supplies, so parents have to buy a bunch of stuff and hand it in to the teacher who them doles it out to students throughout the school year. Of course, there are always some parents who don&#039;t (or can&#039;t) buy the supplies and their children are covered by supplies purchased by other parents. A kind of a forced chessed project.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not commenting on my own children since they have never attended a project-heavy school!  My comments stem from years of observation of schools as well as conversations with parents regarding their children&#039;s classroom experiences.  I&#039;ve also pinch hit for friends who needed a sub in a crunch and spent my morning 1)  assembling projects for over an hour as the children were not given the time to assemble their own projects nor did the have the capability to do so at least within the environment and 2) shuffling children from one activity to another with nary more than 15 minutes on any one project.  I remember sitting the 4 year olds down to paint and little more than 10 minutes had passed and they were told to clean up and move to the next part of the day (guess who cleaned up?  Clue:  not the children).  I believe that this type of rushed environment is counterproductive educationally and that it does not actually benefit the child.  For children that are not quite &quot;in the box&quot; because they are anxiety-prone, prefer a slower paced environment, or have a hard time switching gears, can and do go into full meltdown mode.  


One of the goals of education, even or perhaps especially for younger children, should be to lengthen the attention span, to allow a child to really get into their work, to allow full enjoyment of a project.  Another worthy goal is for children to see a project through from start to finish and when the teachers and assistants follow behind the children with a sponge, I do believe they miss out on an important aspect of their education.

  
I also attended public school and clearly remember than each teacher made their own copies and had a strict limit as to the number of copies that they could make for &quot;free.&quot;  Contrast this to some yeshiva schools that I know of that actually have a full time employee for the copy room.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I think this just comes down to personal issues. Frankly, I love all the little things the kids would come home with. I just think we are mixing up &quot;excess&quot; here. There are certainly materialistic ones that I feel serve no other reason than simply the excess itself. I don&#039;t think this is one of them. Photocopying? Laminating? Sorry, I went to public school system and we had plenty of that. I guess you feel it, because you are asked to pay for it. I also think in this instance, the rabbi is being a little over dramatic that  you can&#039;t enjoy one thing because than the child presents a bunch of other things. Again, this part just seems to be a personal pet-peeve of not wanting (or caring) to see too much work, and disguising this as perhaps something that somehow may harm the child in the future. 

&gt;Lost in the mix is a focus on what a sound education should include, what is good for students, what things that go on go against their educational interests. Personally I think that running from one project to another in a rush to &quot;produce&quot; can be detrimental.



This sounded nice, when I first read it, but ok, what does it mean? What do you suggest? Until you can show me somehow that these pre-school projects are in fact having some detrimental effect on their future - I&#039;m sorry to say - this all sounds like parents having very little interest in these sorts of projects (whether 2 or 20) from the get go.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think Rabbi Fink is right on the money by taking a look a look at pre-school.  I personally was shocked when I started to see the projects that would come home from kids older than mine and it hit me as highly excessive and today still continues to amaze me.  The projects, the lamination, the amount of photocopying in elementary school, the demands for very specific supplies.  The contrast to where I grew up is rather stunning.  Regarding your point, the pre-school excess is certainly an issue at that level.  Schools do feel the need to compete in the arena of projects.  Camps feel the need to compete in the arena of trips.  Lost in the mix is a focus on what a sound education should include, what is good for students, what things that go on go against their educational interests.

		<description><![CDATA[Not only is yeshiva day school the largest chunk, but it dwarfs all the other expenses by FAR. I&#039;ll explain two (and a half) reasons why this is so:
1. Numerically, even for a single child, but especially for the 3.5 average, it is much larger than all the other expenses combined (and I&#039;m including the extra costs of housing in a frum area as well).
2. Most of the other expenses are optional (lechter aren&#039;t required, can use tea lights on aluminum foil, etc). Yeshiva day school is not optional, it is required to be a fully functioning member of a frum community.
3. And for all those other expenses, there are wide variations in cost. Back to lechter, you can buy cheap $50 ones, or expensive $5000 ones. Or meat, you can buy chicken at $2/lb or meat at $15/lb. Or Pesach, you can go elaborate and spend thousands on extra fancy food ad decorations, or you can spend $50 for a few boxes of matzot plus another $120 for the 4 extra meals over a normal week with shabbat. For housing, you can buy a small 3 bedroom home or you can buy a 6 bedroom palace. And so on. When talking about tuition, there isn&#039;t a wide variation in cost, maybe there are two or three schools in the area, but their tuition and fees won&#039;t vary by more than a thousand or two max.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A very good piece overall. There is definite excess that needs to be address (these huge LA bar mitzvah are first on my list). A couple of things though:

&gt;This kind of excess can’t be good. A child who grows up with the kind of attitude towards their work that tells them one thing is never enough, is bound to absorb these lessons and apply them to other areas of life as well.

I don&#039;t think this really qualifies as an excess. There is nothing materialistic about this. Perhaps you personally are tired of having your child showing you a bunch of work, but it is definitely not a materialistic excess that is around in our communities that causes one neighbor to out due another neighbor. No. This is at least work. It is work that they sat down and did. What else do you want them to do in school?

&gt;How can a week vacation during the normal work schedule of most working class people become standard?



There is no real difference between the whole world making their plans for week long summer breaks or doing the same thing but over the winter.]]></description>
