		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not surprised ny this editorial amd specially by his author. A newspaper has to sell so it uses sensationalism, provocation, to attract readers. Everybody does it even chareidi press. My question is why the yated always censores when orthodox Jews are involved in unethical behavior or crime, but on the same time, he&#039;s not afraid to attack or reveal unethical behavior of non orthodox Jews or non Jews. I boycott the chareidi press for a while now, because  i know already the tone of the articles: Cjareidi are always right, and no Chareidim are always wrong, except when they agree with Chareidim. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It’s okay to remind us that we are guests in this country. That’s the beauty of America. &lt;b&gt;We are all guests here.&lt;/b&gt; That’s why we do so well here.&quot;


This is completely wrong. It would be correct to say that we are (pretty much) all immigrants here, but not guests. You could perhaps use the word guests to describe guest workers, legal or illegal, but not people that live here as full citizens.


And the reason we do well is because we integrate into society and participate socially, economically, politically, etc. Those that do not integrate, or that do their utmost to prevent integration, like Yated and their supporters, do not do as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your last paragraph is really the only one that matters.  the Lipshits &quot;editorial&quot; is the easy product of a continuing culture of grievance and persecution.  If he and his ilk would wake up to reality and acknowledge that the image of the world outside their ghetto that they paint on the inside of its walls is a parody of reality and not a reflection, just maybe they wouldn&#039;t be so easily hurt like the frightened bunnies they seem to be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[https://www.facebook.com/ortho.diction/posts/201770633360767

I read this poem
And am overwhelmed with grief
My eyes fill with tears
Salty as the sweat of slaves in Egypt
Salty as Jerusalem soil after the Roman conquest
Salty as the chicken soup of so many Bubbies
Killed by Nazis and Communists and Greeks and Democrats

I hear the cries
Of Anti-Semitism 
Of pending pogroms and imminent inquisitions
Growing louder and more strident
Drowning out the whimpers
Of Agunot and abuse victims
Shouting outward rather than looking inward 

I look at the papers
But amid the solicitations and Segulas 
Amid the Chumras and bans and Kol Korehs
Nary an exhortation to be a Mentsch
To be honest
To be an Ehrliche Yid

I think back 
To all those who wanted us dead
Sure, we’re here, and they’re gone, but why?
So we could colonize the world with Pesach resorts?
Steal from insurers and banks and governments and gentiles?
Successfully ban all produce?
They may not have killed us
But they’ve killed Isaiah and Amos and the rest 
And without them
Jewish blood is indeed cheap

I await Moshiach
But fear that he is no longer waiting for us]]></description>
