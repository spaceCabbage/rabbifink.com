		<description><![CDATA[But wouldnt concerned parents want to know how to prevent what happened to Caleb to happen to their children?  Perhaps that extra hug would be enough - if that was what was missing.  But if there was internet foul play, or hitchhiking foulplay, or I cant even imagine what would lead a good boy to WILLINGLY leave home.  The extra hugs would hopefully prevent that.  But if it was UNWILLING - how can we prevent that?  We all felt the same - wanting to know what happened to Gilad Shalit - if that was preventable - and this situation went all the up to Knesset on how to prevent abductions and what to do when they do happen (G*d forbid).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great emotions of yours, Rabbi, We must love our children through our actions toward them - not only giving them words and gifts. Instead of going alone to a walk, jog, swim, play - anything and even when you go to the mechanic, lawyer  or doctor - invite them and behave the way you spend time with the best friend who you&#039;ve been missing by heart. Travels, movies, theater, what to read, world affairs, neighbors pain,and, of course, the sea of jokes and  even visiting cemeteries. As you are doing all that, do not preach and do not try to be likable parent. Act as a friend. Kids know who you are.]]></description>
