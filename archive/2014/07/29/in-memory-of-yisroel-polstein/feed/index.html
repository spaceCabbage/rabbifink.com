		<description><![CDATA[I went to Yeshivas Hakayitz from 2006-2008.  Out of all of Rabbi Polstein&#039;s kids. I only met Yis once.  I remember him speaking to us during shiur.  He told us a story about a room mate he had, who was also on drugs.  Little did I know.  
Even though its been 5 months, at times my thoughts are still with the Polsteins.  They are truly some of the kindest, warmest, most amazing people I met.  Watching this again breaks my heart.
Addiction is a disease that has shown time and time again how deadly it is.  We must have nothing but compassion for these people, and do what we can to help them get better.
May we all hear of better things, and see Yis and all the others who lost their lives to addiction in the coming of the third Beis Hamikdash B&#039;mehera B&#039;yameinu Amen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so sad right now. I knew him only when he was at Bais, we used to learn together and he told me that he had had some problems but he was over it. And he really was it seemed......... We learnt lots together, not only torah but also many other things about life. He was so wise, the many times he convinced me to do the right thing and not give in, and he really meant. it. I never knew the other Yis, I only heard about it afterwords. He was a G-dsend to me and so many others. So many positive words, so little judgement of when we had fallen. I&#039;ve often wondered what happened to him and now i&#039;m really sad that he&#039;s gone. He was amazing and I&#039;ve never known anyone like him. Boruch Dayan Haemes]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t know him, but I went to the Yeshiva and knew his family very well.  If there is a lesson from this, it&#039;s that addiction is a bitch.  It doesn&#039;t care who you are or what you have done, often striking down the best of us in the prime of life. Even with the most supportive family and community, it is incredibly hard to beat. Until we have a better way to treat it, the most important thing we can do is lessen the shame of those suffering from it.  Once we all acknowledge it as a disease not a personal or moral shortcoming, we make it easier for victims to ask for help.  Thanks for starting the conversation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I grew up with Yis. We went to Yeshivas Tiferes Tzvi together as well as Skokie Yeshiva. He was one of the smartest guys I knew. I recall vividly when he would ask the rebbe questions on the gemara that he could not answer. There were many brilliant students in that shiur, but Yis outshined them all. 
Yis was a great guy and a great friend. 
My heartfelt condolences go out to his parents and siblings. Baruch Dayan Emes.]]></description>
