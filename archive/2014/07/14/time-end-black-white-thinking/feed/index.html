I stand by what I said.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[G*3, I too want to be snarky and say they were wrong. That&#039;s why I phrased it as a question, rather than a statement. And perhaps in certain settings we can concede that they were, in fact, wrong. Or that they overstated the case, etc. But it is undeniable that the black and white model gave their viewpoint a lasting imprint that it would not have had had they gone for nuance.
As for the other point - if we were to thank everyone for the good they do, we would be thanking Al Capone for his soup kitchens and Mussolini for the efficiency he brought to the railroads. We don&#039;t let minor benefits distract from the overall character. Look at the left - in their view of the world President Bush Jr. was evil, the devil, etc. etc., but even they cant deny he was a great friend of Israel and the Jewish people. Ever hear one word one thanks from them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s certainly nuance within Chazal.  For instance, many people like to quote the statement that claims David HaMelech never sinned as an example of Chazal whitewashing our heroes.  In fact, this is a daas yachid.  On the other hand, people like to prove that Tanach is truthful because it contains nuanced portrayals of our leaders and even villains.  You can quibble about Chazal (especially because there are so many of them), but Hashem and our neviim were certainly not interested in censorship or protecting us from actually having to think about the stories they told us.  As far as I can tell, one of the earliest &quot;culprits&quot; in monochromatization (if that wasn&#039;t a word before, then now it is) of Judaism is Rashi.  As the master teacher, one of his purposes in writing his commentary was to turn Jewish heroes into purely good characters and villains into purely evil characters, which goes hand in hand with all of his comments about how much Hashem loves the Jewish People.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where do you ever see within Jewish history nuance thinking such as you describe or even the push toward that kind of thinking process? As DF says, it seems that chazal and post chazal were much more comfortable in the black/white way of thinking. Whether it was rabbis opinions on Rambam, or the EybeschÃ¼tz Scandal or even plane old commentary you find in our books you find a black/white approach to issues. You name it. So when you say that the the Orthodox community has shown an &lt;em&gt;increasingly&lt;/em&gt; difficult time with non-absolutes, I would like it if you can support that this is something of an aberration.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;  They saw it in black and white, thus giving clear guidance, rather than wishy-washy equivocation. Were they wrong?

I want to be snarky and say yes, they were wrong. But I&#039;ll give them the benefit of the doubt, and assume that Chazal were trying to derive lessons from the text, rather than understand the characters as real people.

&#062; Finally, even if, purely for the sake of argument only, we could say Obama gets credit - why should we be singing Hossanas to him? Every single U.S. President from Truman on has done at least some good things for Israel. 

Isn&#039;t R&#039; Fink&#039;s point that we should say thank you for the good things, regardless of anything else?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, all of chazal saw things in black and white. Esau was a Rasha, Yaakov was a tzaddik. None of them ever saw fit to pscho-analyze them and see &quot;nuance&quot; in their characters. They could easily have done so. They could have called Esau manly and Jacob conniving, as Mark Twain (and many others) did. But they didn&#039;t. They saw it in black and white, thus giving clear guidance, rather than wishy-washy equivocation. Were they wrong?

As for thanking Obama - amazing how you leftwingers are so selective of the facts. Jon Tobin already noted in Commentary that Obama&#039;s budget wanted to cut funding for Israel&#039;s missile defense. He then notes: &quot;Moreover, the decision to pare back missile defense is particularly embarrassing because American support for Israelâs âIron Domeâ system is something Obama has taken credit for at every possible opportunity, even though the project was initiated and funded by George W. Bush.&quot;
Predictably, the left wing blogosphere, notably Ron Kampeas, the long time liberal of the JTA, furiously try&#039;s to deny this. Partisans, of course, will believe who they will. But don&#039;t pretend that -  at minimum - the issue isn&#039;t debatable. To claim as a &quot;dovor poshut&quot; that we should now be prostrating ourselves at the idol of Obama because of Iron Dome?-- ridiculous. 
Finally, even if, purely for the sake of argument only, we could say Obama gets credit - why should we be singing Hossanas to him? Every single U.S. President from Truman on has done at least some good things for Israel. How can they not, with a pro-Israel Congress? Presidents like Truman, LBJ, and Bush Jr., went out of their way to buck powerful party members to support Israel. On the left&#039;s theory that Obama gets credit for Iron Dome, did he do anything out of the ordinary to do that? Again, for the sake or argument only.]]></description>
