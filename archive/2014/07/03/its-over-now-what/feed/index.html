		<description><![CDATA[The angst you describe over how to continue your new rituals, or not, is typical of all attempts to create new rituals. After 9/11, some groups lit candles or even released balloons on the next anniversary. One year later though, they were gone. And of course, that example can be multiplied.
Perhaps its easier to simply not call them &quot;new rituals.&quot; I see nothing wrong with leaving empty chairs, for example. It&#039;s a nice symbol. But it would never be able to last more than a few weeks without becoming trite. Same with adding a chapter of Psalms at the end of davening. For a few weeks, it has power and meaning. After that, it just becomes another layer of the closing service, and people walk out on it. We Jews already have plenty of rituals, many would say too many, without the need for adding more. A temporary symbol for one Shabbos, or perhaps two, serves the purpose, without attempting to make it anything more than that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although the American Jewish world was invested and united in its search for Leiby Kletzky, we don&#039;t have candles and chairs set aside for him.  Why not?  And as you say, the emotional involvement grew more and more as time went on; yet it seems the authorities and families knew from the beginning that the boys were almost definitely dead.  People weren&#039;t emotionally involved because they were davening to find bodies; they were davening to find them alive.]]></description>
