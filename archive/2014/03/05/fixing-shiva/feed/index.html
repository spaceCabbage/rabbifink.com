		<description><![CDATA[Actually, our tradition says that when we enter a house of mourning, we should not say anything. We should let the mourner speak first, and follow the mourner&#039;s lead. If the mourner feels uncomfortable with the silence, the mourner can break it. You don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on in the mourner&#039;s head and heart. Perhaps silence is exactly what they want at that moment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Definitely.  And I don&#039;t think an illness is easier on the family, just different.  Coping with a long, drawn-out illness is incredibly tough on the family , but the shock has already been dealt with by the time of the shiva.  I do remember a shiva for someone whose mother died in a car accident, and the family was completely shell-shocked.  When the niftar has been ill for a while, the family is drained and exhausted - but not shocked.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess it is one way of seeing it, but definitely not the only way, and IMO not accurate in my personal experience, because there is no one cookie cutter way to handle shivas. The part about Empathy is true, mostly, but not all for Jewish cultures. I think any piece advising shiva visitors should mention that people say &#039;shtuyos&#039; but who cares, and just mainly, DO NOT talk about shtuyos like sports, movies, and stuff. Sure, many people are uncomfortable, mostly because I find that there is no real education about his mitzvah, so people naturally like to find a comfort zone But not sure if talking about TV shows is the way to go to waste a mourners time. And if a mourner themselves does go in that direction, certainly, better to talk about things the author says not to like &#039;how did he die&#039;. I found that at my father&#039;s shiva, indeed, I was able to console visitors, many whom had not yet gone through that themselves and that certainly helped me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have heard people as &quot;was he sick&quot; and I always assumed it was a shorthand way of asking was the death somewhat expected, vs. completely unexpected.  While there&#039;s no way to mitigate the loss, there is a world of difference in terms of expectation when someone has been suffering with cancer for months or years, compared to someone who walked out of the house perfectly healthy one morning and got hit by a bus.  I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a rude question, but having heard other thoughts, I think I&#039;ll be careful not to ask it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good post. I would add on, don&#039;t ask how old was he as if it can create some template for a normal vs abnormal death. Most of all, visitors have to learn to live with the discomfort of death and mourning. If they can accept it, the mourners will have space to express themselves wether with words, non-verbal communication, or just silence. Everyone says BDE, but if they really meant it, they would not be diagnosing the death (and the life).]]></description>
