		<description><![CDATA[Tesyaa, The things you are listing here are COMPLETELY different than the things previously given as examples of &quot;Martha Stewart style&quot; that I was responding to previously. The things you are listing are more in the &quot;ruchniyut&quot; domain (good behavior, learning, good parenting, high tznius standards, etc), while the things listed in this post are more in the &quot;gashmiyut&quot; domain (party planners for kiddush, out of this world sukkah decorations, custom parsha cakes, etc).


And I completely agree, affluence has nothing to do (at least not directly) with the things that *you* listed.


I wonder if @efink:disqus agrees with you that the Martha Stewart style Judaism also applies to the [thin] veneer of perfection that is painted over everything orthodox Jews do?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark, I totally disagree that the pretense of a perfect life is due to affluence (even though I can&#039;t entirely pinpoint the source myself).  You see it even among the poor, and it&#039;s often not related to material things (although, as you point out, it often is).  Even very poor people can take pride in their perfectly behaved frum children (and of course, there&#039;s no place for an OTD or questioning child in such a lineup).  Even the very poor can be proud of their wonderful parenting skills, which ensure that none of their children will ever need to see a counselor or a psychologist.  Even the very poor can be proud that their high school boys learn 16 hours a day, or that their daughters are so dedicated to tznius.  

If I can think of any reason why the frum velt tries so hard to present perfection, it may be the influx of BTs into chareidi circles.  The normally insular chareidi world might, despite its protestations, feel some measure of defensiveness when its lifestyle is exposed in detail to these newcomers.  If people in the frum world have many of the same problems as the nonreligious, how can it claim to be a better lifestyle?  Therefore, the claim to perfection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think you&#039;re understand exactly what I mean, but I was responding to your sentence - &lt;i&gt;&quot;It’s the kind of Judaism that gave us gourmet cookbooks, party planner designed kiddushes, parsha cakes, out of this world Sukkah decorations, and amazing holiday crafts.&quot;&lt;/i&gt; Most of these things have costs (or effort, etc) associated with them, as I mentioned below. And generally, the people that take them further to the extreme incur greater costs and expend much more effort. It&#039;s not a value judgement, it&#039;s just a statement of fact.


When I was a younger, we had 2 cookbooks, maybe 3 (&quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot; and grandma&#039;s hand written one of course). Now we have a full shelf of them, including 5 or 6 volumes of the wonderful Kosher by Design series. When I was younger, nobody ever even heard of a &quot;party planner&quot; (if it even existed at the time), now they are a common service used for weddings and bar mitzvah parties ... and now even for kiddushim. When I was younger, our sukkah decorations were made by the children and were simple.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My observations tell me that it is part of the growing affluence (and the accompanying entitlement mentality) of the orthodox community.

Despite @efink:disqus&#039;s claim below that &quot;cost has nothing to do with this&quot;, he&#039;s wrong, in many cases, cost has a lot to do with it. A big part of Martha Stewart style is to show off to others. So, for those gourmet cookbooks, people design special shelf cabinets in their custom kitchen. And the party planner designed kiddushes add thousands of dollars in many cases. Those fancy parsha cakes take a lot of effort, or a lot of expense when custom made by the local bake shop. The out of this world Sukkah decorations take a lot of effort to create, or more likely money to buy. And as for the amazing holiday crafts, some of the new houses come with &quot;craft rooms&quot; nowadays.


Meanwhile, in the pre-affluence world, in the world where people still live in [small] apartments in the city, just having ready access to a sukkah period is celebrated! And those large dining rooms where you can host 25 people simply don&#039;t exist.]]></description>

You are basically saying that everyone can get along, there is room for all of us in the big orthodox jewish tent, and I am saying that is pure nonsense in the &quot;real&quot; orthodox jewish world that most of us live in.  even the modernishe - as mark points out below, cant accept people that are different, and are tolerant of the intolerant and ungreatful (this was in reference to Gil essentially endorsing the recent charedi protest against the state of israel - i barely can type that without gagging - its unbelievable)
unless this piece was a wish, like a disney theme.  if you believe in your dream eli, your dreams will come true]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really? I&#039;m not so sure. For example, is it permitted to have an excessive amount (measured by cost, effort, and/or quantity) of decorations for a holiday? Is it permitted to use fruits and vegetables for sukkah decorations? Is it permitted to use gold shavings as cake decorations? etc. Or is it a form of bal tashchit?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What we do impacts others whether that&#039;s fair or not. It&#039;s one thing to Martha Stewart at home, on your own Shabbos or yontiff table, and something else entirely to &quot;show off&quot; in your Mishloach Manos, even if you really are doing it because you love it and it feels like hiddur mitzva. We can take more responsibility for our community by keeping our extra special stuff more private, and keeping the public standards lower (e.g. simpler, fewer mishloach manos, more zdaka instead) and more inclusive.]]></description>

It&#8217;s one thing to Martha Stewart at home, on your own Shabbos or yontiff table, and something else entirely to &#8220;show off&#8221; in your Mishloach Manos, even if you really are doing it because you love it and it feels like hiddur mitzva. We can take more responsibility for our community by keeping our extra special stuff more private, and keeping the public standards lower (e.g. simpler, fewer mishloach manos, more zdaka instead) and more inclusive.</p>

How do you deal with that?  Or is it all inclusive, fluffy, nice, everybody so happy, cool dude, ocean, LA orthodox Judaism??  (which only exists in your shul, apparently)]]></description>
