		<description><![CDATA[I would like to point out that the problem is that so-called &quot;chazal&quot; have absolutely no legitimate authority according to the Written Torah. Levites and Judges are the ones who have legitimate authority to interpret the Written Torah.

YLT Dt 17:8 .  &#039;When anything is too hard for thee for judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke--matters of strife within thy gates--then thou hast risen, and gone up unto the place on which Jehovah thy God doth fix,

YLT Dt 17:9 and hast come in unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge who is in those days, and hast inquired, and they have declared to thee the word of judgment,

YLT Dt 17:10 and thou hast done according to the tenor of the word which they declare to thee (they of that place which Jehovah doth choose; and thou hast observed to do according to all that they direct thee.

YLT Dt 17:11  &#039;According to the tenor of the law which they direct thee, and according to the judgment which they say to thee thou dost do; thou dost not turn aside from the word which they declare to thee, right or left.

YLT Dt 17:12 And the man who acteth with presumption, so as not to hearken unto the priest (who is standing to serve there Jehovah thy God), or unto the judge, even that man hath died, and thou hast put away the evil thing from Israel,

YLT Dt 17:13 and all the people do hear and fear, and do not presume any more.

And we are to listen to Levites and Judges ONLY if they follow Written Torah. If they preach something else - they give-up their authority and right to interpret the Torah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I noticed that some comments below have pointed out the flawed nature of the &quot;Speed Limit&quot; analogy, but I wanted to elaborate and see how HaRav Fink responds: the problem, essentially, with your analogy is that, while a person would be pulled over for going 42 MPH on a 35 MPH road, the scientist who concluded that 42 MPH would be equally safe could very well go to his county/city government and present his findings; then, if the representatives/politicians accept his research, they could change the speed limit to 42 MPH. 


The legal decisions made by the Sages, on the other hand, are &quot;unchangeable,&quot; according to Orthodoxy, and, as you stated-- regardless of whether their logic or assumptions were correct, Jews are bound by them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t understand the question.  The orthodox world is reluctant to permit its young to take a stroll into the secular world for education or discussion.  To learn other points of views, presented by outsiders.

I don&#039;t know much about Bar Ilan - but I understand it is a true college, one that has a higher number of religious students.

Not sure what you mean by the right-wing running education in the U.S.  If you mean religious education, I can&#039;t tell you where the indoctrination is higher.

I just feel that religious education is very self-confident -- as long as they are the only teachers in the room, they provide all the books and they ban television and outside materials from being examined.  I just think that is a kind of farce.  It is a type of dishonesty.

I have nothing against religion - I have a lot against deception, omission, distortion, suppression.  I have a lot against indoctrination posing as education.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the relationship of the founding fathers to the divine was pretty complex.  Thomas Jefferson had a lot of critiques of this idea of the G-d who created us and calls the shots, but like others in his crowd, they felt that people would not go along with the ideals they had for the new country if they were &quot;out&quot; about their feelings.  I read a book called &quot;Freethinkers&quot; that was helpful in understanding this.

But the idea of one G-d (either taken literally or metaphorically) certain helps with the idea of equality of all people under G-d.  it may not actually be necessary, but it helps.  people from all backgrounds (including polytheistic, agnostic, atheistic) seem to understand the &quot;self evident&quot; truths our founding fathers relied on.

To me, Judaism cannot keep up with the enlightened world.   It was certainly more advanced five hundred years ago, but it has fallen behind.  And the enlightened world is not in the least afraid of open inquiry, debate, education, dissent.  The Jewish world fears and hates these concepts.

Which is of course why the walls are so high for the Jewish world.  Its gut instinct is that it cannot afford a sustained, unflinching encounter with the modern world.  It will be seen to be less ideal, not more.  It&#039;s kind of a mess, but the rabbis are going to fight any exposure to outside voices come hell or highwater.  They are understandably terrified of members of the community evaluating their claims.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Chazal? we look at them from hundreds or thousands of years later - but they are still calling the shots. it&#039;s a much less perfect way for perfecting the world.&quot;



Tuvia, like I said above, I think it would greatly interest you in finding the RAN&#039;s 12 essays. In one of them he discusses how the civil laws of Spain, in his day, are better suited to maintain a coherent society than halacha. This is because, as he says, halacha is crystalized in the Talmud rather than a living and breathing system that would allow organic changes depending on the times. As a side note, you know that inalienable rights were attached to the concept of man being created by a God, and thus serving as a sort of &quot;anchor&quot; to that principle. Once there exists something to anchor the core principle, you can move from there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[G*3,

I&#039;ve been pressing some of the religious bloggers for a while to justify their actions.  (I couldn&#039;t ask in person - then I would be a shaygitz and persona non grata.)
I just ask the basic questions, like here - or why is there so much evil and pain in the world, or why do you care what God wants, etc.

No one can give a reasonable answer to these questions.  Period.   Some people tie themselves in knots attempting to. 
For example,  here - we see Rav Fink saying - I struggle, it bothers me a lot - but no rational behavior follows. 

So, I&#039;ve learned that I&#039;ve got the question backwards.  People are not religious because they look out into the world and make logical deductions..   People are religious because it resonates with them, they feel it.  It&#039;s like another human sensibility.  Call it the God sense.   We must be designed for it somehow.
Thay ask the same questions that I do,  but they are trying to make the answers conform to their inner sense.   But it&#039;s that inner sense that takes precedence - even in the face of intellectually wobbly and painful justifications. 

And wherever they are on the continuum from mystical to Slifkin rational, it&#039;s not reward and punishment or repairing the spiritual spheres that&#039;s driving them, rather, ultimately it&#039;s just a very human, psychological reality which they can&#039;t (or  do not want to)  shake..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i feel like laws have teeth because we live in a democracy  and therefore they represent our collective decision making.  it makes no difference that it&#039;s a representative democracy of course. 
also, with laws, even speed limits, if we, the people, decide the limit is too low or too high we can change it.
in our society, a representative democracy, it is a given that we keep trying to improve upon laws - they are not immutable or stand forever.
this is once you get past the basics of the Bill of Rights, which is a system of rights that all people have - that then leads us to enact protections so that everyone&#039;s rights are upheld.
Chazal? we look at them from hundreds or thousands of years later  - but they are still calling the shots.  it&#039;s a much less perfect way for perfecting the world.
the enlightenment, natural rights, inalienable rights, equality under the law, the bill of rights - these ideas (all man-made and no one is insecure about that or claiming ruach hakodesh or divinely given) are much more important to the citizens of our country, and the envy of that part of the world that lives under repressive monarch/junta types.
there really is no comparison.  our society is better.  it has one massive obligation: you can&#039;t trample on the rights of others.  this leads to the incredible and sophisticated body of law we have today (one subject to constant improvement, again, with no insecurity over what this may imply about our secular forefathers&#039; wisdom.)  Beis din&#039;s?  not even close.

the US has pioneered most of the values in our system of world governance.  The US Consitution is much more a &quot;light unto the nations&quot; than the Jews are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot; the greater philosophical question of WHY would God put that sort of stuff in the first place.&quot;


There are many ways to address this issue:
1. God used different language than we did, so we don&#039;t clearly understand the definition of many of the words used. For example, names of certain animals referred to different animals than we use those words for today.
2. God &quot;thinks&quot; differently than we do, leading to a lack of understanding of certain concepts in the the Torah.
3. They were included for the purpose of a wider (or narrower) lesson.
4. God presented the Torah to the people of the time and thus phrased it in language that they would understand, and included concepts that they would more readily accept.
5. Maybe it&#039;s a test, and God is observing us, and &quot;grading&quot; us, on our moral interpretation of the laws he presented us with.
etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is why religion has become increasingly mystical over the past few centuries. As we learn more about the world and see that religious dictates often don&#039;t match what we see, we have to shunt the reasons for those dictates into the mystical realm to justify continued observance.


To expand on the point of the post: People keep halacha because that&#039;s how you get points in the Game of Judaism. It doesn&#039;t matter how well the rules of the game fit with reality, or even if the rules were made based on a mistaken understanding of reality. Those are the rules, and God, Who&#039;s running the game, will reward or punish people based on the rules of the game.


For those who are mystically inclined, you can make up all sorts of reasons why doing X, even though it has no grounding in reality, is shaking the heavens and pulling strings in the mystical world. For those not so inclined, and who want to stay religious, it&#039;s best to accept that it&#039;s just an arbitrary game. We&#039;re God&#039;s reality show.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are answers to everything, but they&#039;re mostly bad answers.


1) I think that the ban on homosexuality is a combination of the Torah&#039;s obsession with categorizing (and it&#039;s discomfort with anything that doesn&#039;t fit neatly into a category) and it&#039;s antagonism towards anything even slightly related to idol worship.
2) That&#039;s what moderate Muslims say about Jihad. It&#039;s always interesting how similar different religions really are.

		<description><![CDATA[Instead of the speed limit scenario, how about we look at it this way.


Many years ago, doctors were sure that blood-letting was a cure for fever.  As such, for all generations since, we must blood-let.  So what if we now understand the science and logic behind it differently, let&#039;s all blood-let for any time someone runs a fever instead of using Tylenol or anti-biotics.


That&#039;s precisely how I feel when I see halachot based on mistaken understanding of basic female physiology or biology of astronomy, etc.


Why in my right mind should I follow halachot, which have NO grounding in reality?


The same way I now will NEVER cut my daughter when she runs a fever, why should I teach her otherwise with regards to halacha?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not all of chazal&#039;s mistakes are due to mistaken scientific knowledge of their times. There are a number of cases where their scientific knowledge was not coming from the scientific knowledge of the time, but rather from their interpretation of verses and their logic and yet were also mistaken. So while I agree they were influenced in many matters from current thought, this is not a sufficient answer to their interpretation errors. Simply put, the overhwelming majority of the interpretations that can be tested have been found to be lacking. Why put trust in them being worthy interpretors then?
 If they can be horrible at interpreting, what makes them special? Their own belief in their specialness?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your main point (that they have the legal authority even if it was based on flawed information) is accurate, but insufficient nonetheless.

Taking your example of driving 42mph in a 35mph zone, you are correct that the judge in traffic court will not allow the scientific safety study to affect whether the driver is found guilty, but I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll agree that the motivation to not drive 42 rests only on the fear of being caught, not the fact that it is against the law. There is no &quot;traffic court&quot; that decides the fate of one who breaks Jewish law, so even if one agrees that Chazal had the authority to decide Jewish law, there is no fear of being found guilty of breaking their perceived to be flawed laws.

What about G-d, though? Will G-d punish someone who broke a flawed law? From a traditional perspective, yes, He will. Merely disobeying laws made by those to whom He gave the authority to make the law is enough to warrant punishment. I think you&#039;d agree with that, but it wasn&#039;t clearly stated in your piece. This was, IMO, just the first insufficient aspect; it needs to be clearly stated that because Chazal had the authority to determine what the law would be, we will be held accountable in the heavenly court for not obeying that law. And this is true whether the law was made based on misinformation or not.

The second area where there is a deficiency (and this one I&#039;m not sure you&#039;d agree with) is about the role of divine guidance in the law-making process. Since Chazal had the authority to make the law, and the laws they made would impact G-d fearing Jews for hundreds, even thousands, of years, we can be confident that G-d would intervene in the law-making process so that flawed laws that would adversely impact religious Jews for generations are not made, or are at least mitigated (see page 2 of www.aishdas.org/ta/5765/shemini.pdf). If we are confident in G-d still being involved in the world He created, and confident that He gave Chazal the authority to determine the law, we should also be confident that the final result (the laws we must keep) are of real value to us (beyond just being obedient). This is true even if the reasoning Chazal used to make the law was flawed.

The third area where your piece is deficient (and I think you may agree with the first part, but doubt you&#039;ll agree with the consequences), is regarding the respect the sages are due. Even if they relied on the science of their time, they were still great and holy men, and their words and perspectives have immense value even if the paradigm they were working within had some misinformation. From this perspective, it is how they reacted based on the information they were working with that still has real value for us. For example, even if the medical advice they gave was primitive because of the state of medicine in their time, we can definitely see that they valued the scientific knowledge that was available to them, and acted accordingly. We may know that blood-letting has little medicinal value; knowing that they were in favor of regular blood-letting shouldn&#039;t lead to the conclusion that we should do the same, but that we should follow the advice of the medical community in our times just as they followed the medical advice in their times.

More-so, from a religious perspective, basing themselves on flawed science in scientific matters makes little difference when it comes to religious matters. Most of the lessons of the Talmud (and the corpus of Jewish literature that is based upon it) is not relevant to how accurate their science was. The very notion of equating a lack of scientific accuracy with a lack of religious accuracy is preposterous. The question you posed is &quot;why should I listen to the rabbis if they made mistakes.&quot; Aside from the fact that they had the authority to determine the law, we should listen to the rabbis because they were religious giants, and their mandates for living a religious life are extremely valid and valuable, and are no less so just because they weren&#039;t all-knowing regarding scientific fields. No, we shouldn&#039;t follow their medical advice, but we should follow their advice when they say go to the doctor and follow his or her instructions. And we should certainly follow their advice when it comes to living a life the way G-d wants/expects us to.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your main point (that they have the legal authority even if it was based on flawed information) is accurate, but insufficient nonetheless.</p>
<p>Taking your example of driving 42mph in a 35mph zone, you are correct that the judge in traffic court will not allow the scientific safety study to affect whether the driver is found guilty, but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree that the motivation to not drive 42 rests only on the fear of being caught, not the fact that it is against the law. There is no &#8220;traffic court&#8221; that decides the fate of one who breaks Jewish law, so even if one agrees that Chazal had the authority to decide Jewish law, there is no fear of being found guilty of breaking their perceived to be flawed laws.</p>
<p>What about G-d, though? Will G-d punish someone who broke a flawed law? From a traditional perspective, yes, He will. Merely disobeying laws made by those to whom He gave the authority to make the law is enough to warrant punishment.

Roughly - Don&#039;t even think that in the days of Mashiach that nature will change in any way or that anything new will be created. Rather the world will continue as it is.

... And he isn&#039;t coming to declare people tamei or tahor, and not to declare who is passul and who isn&#039;t, but rather to bring peace upon the world.

12:5 -

ולא יהיה עסק כל העולם אלא לדעת את ה&#039; בלבד ולפיכך יהיו ישראל חכמים גדולים ויודעים דברים הסתומים וישיגו דעת בוראם כפי כח האדם

According to some, like Rambam IIRC, what we pray for is really a state of peace across the world without many specific changes made to governance. Basically, even when redemption occurs, interpretation can go on and on and on (things like meat eating really being a reshut rather than a tzivui, etc) as usual.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The commenter asked if the Torah was at odds with your values.&quot;

Of course it is! It&#039;s full of the death penalty for example, death for this, death for that, etc. But the essential point is that we are rabbinical Jews, not Torah Jews, and that makes all the difference in the world, because the rabbis can interpret away much of the conflicting stuff. It just takes time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) maybe it is referring to a hetero person - its an abomination for him to act on this
2) maybe amalek is not an actual person/nation, but a concept.  we should uproot from our traits
3) &quot;requires the death penalty&quot; sounds bad, the bottom line is we don&#039;t kill anyone, and we never did....
there is an answer to everything, PG]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just to add to your question. Is God a dictator?
We where thought in yeshivah that God does all for a reason. Chazal try to explain what is the reasoning of Gods laws. If the reasoning behind the laws fall apart, what is left of the law? A law without rational reasoning is dictatorship!  And believing that when moshiach comes will will understand why we kill a person that was mchalel shabbos, is absurd. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rav Fink,
I really appreciate your willingness to address these issues.  I assue you that these are not merely theoretical  concerns.

Your topic was - Chazal Made Mistakes.  In a related theme, I am proposing – the Torah Made Mistakes,  – How do we deal with that? 

Three quick examples:
1)  It calls male homosexual activity an “abomination”.
2) It calls for the genocide / ethnic cleansing of the Canaanite nations, esp. the Amalekites – including women and children
3) It requires the death penalty for all sorts of victimless crimes, esp. ritual transgressions (e.g., Sabbath violations)  and all sorts of sexual transgressions.  

I assume all the above are at “odds with your values” – as they are with mine.  

I don’t understand your “struggles”, that sounds like a delaying tactic.  We know these things are wrong. 
“I am not in a position where they severely affect me directly.”  Really?  It’s all one Torah.  Is it your belief that this is the word of God? 
 If so, it’s got to create incredible cognitive dissonance.

The question is – how do you deal with all this – and not just walk away?
 
Thanks.]]></description>
