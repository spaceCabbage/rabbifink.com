		<description><![CDATA[I guess I don&#039;t see the large difference between humanism and theism. Certainly many Orthodox Jews feel confident in doing mitzvot because they believe G-d commanded them just as many evangelical Christians feel confident asserting that Jesus saves because they have an emotional experience of Jesus that feels real to them.  But when you get into the details of daily life, theism starts to look a lot more like humanism.  Protestants change churches and practices all the time (ALL the time) because they feel &quot;called&quot; to do something else or because they reach a new understanding of G-d&#039;s will by studying the Bible.  Certainly, they believe that this is a message from G-d but from the outside, it looks a lot like making a decision about what&#039;s best for you. 
Similarly, while there is a lot of agreement in Orthodoxy about what G-d commanded, there is also a lot of disagreement when you get into something as common as what bracha to make over pizza or whether cholov stam is acceptable.  In making those decisions, people are guided by family, hashkafa, study -- all of which may change over time.  The humanists and atheists I know spend just as much time thinking &quot;what is the right thing to do in this situation?&quot; as Orthodox Jews spend thinking &quot;what does halacha say about this?&quot; and evangelicals spend praying over the matter.
Those are all ways of trying to discern correct action.  What they all have in common is the belief that it&#039;s our job to figure out which action is most correct and then to take it.  
Being human, we may fail.  The atheist may listen to his baser instincts, the evangelical may decide that G-d wants him to do the thing he most wants to do and the Jew may decide that halacha magically aligns which what he thinks is right.  There is equal potential for failure.
I think people who are committed to living a moral and ethical life has much more in common with each other than they do with people who do not care to examine their own behavior very carefully. I have more in common with atheists who believe in living an examined life than I do with fundamentalists who can&#039;t explain why they have chosen to believe one interpretation of a verse over another.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your post is well-presented, but at its core, we know as much about God today as we did 5000 years ago. And, in the elapsed 5000 years, the basic emotions of man have not changed. Thus, there are no trends, nothing is slowly changing, belief is not growing or shrinking - it&#039;s all Koheles, man. gopniks&#039;s articles, which I admit I wont bother to read, seem to reflect one dude&#039;s development - his own -  in his approach to God, and projecting his thoughts on to the world at large.
Would also add that G*3 is right.  Judaism, at least since the days of the chazal, and at least among the people who care about it the most, has been about legalism and to a lesser extent moralisms that grow out of the legalisms. The Christians have the monopoly on the underpinnings of belief. We sort of take it for granted. Does anyone compare to, say, C.S. Lewis, in setting forth the basics of belief?
[As related to that point, we have a mumar li-hachis and a mumar li-teavon, but no mumar li-emunoso, a guy who goes off because he no longer believes. We have, however, the concept of apikoris. Does it say anything that we have mumar concepts for the first two, but we must create a separate category for someone who simply disbelieves? I&#039;m asking, not challenging.]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;But here again, there is a growing sense in our community that these proofs are insufficient at best and counter productive at worst. &quot;

Steve Savitsky interviewed Rabbi Moshe Benovitz( Savitsky Talks, “Technology and Social Media: How Are They Affecting the Post-High School Year in Israel?”, 8/1/12, 13:00 in mp3, some of which I transcribed below, and which is available on the OU website). He is not discussing proofs for God, but it is a  related subject:

R. Benovitz:

…In the kiruv community, for example, they are coming to grips with the fact that some of the arguments– historical arguments, philosophical arguments– that like I said a charismatic educator could tell a person off the street and who would know better, is checked instantly on a hand held device that’s pulled out of a pocket. If those arguments do not hold water, then we’ve done more damage than good. We need to adjust to that, and we should adjust to that.

Steve Savitsky: Do you have an example of that?

R. Benovitz: …This is probably beyond the scope of this limited discussion because there are obviously complexities and layers here. But examples like mass revelation at Sinai being the only way possible, when you have challenges from other sources, the fact that Torah seems to have been forgotten in certain periods explicitly in the Navi and the like. The chain of the Mesorah– there is certain reason to believe that there were times where it was if not broken, but then it was down to a precious few; that’s a challenge, just to use one example, [to that] mass revelation argument of sorts. [Similarly there are challenges] in the scientific realm, and in the archaeological realm.

We need to be able to know that there is information at the fingertips of our students that of course we have answers to, and of course we have ways of responding to, but to just throw arguments out there, they’re not going to, nor should they simply accept at face value.”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that one can find (personal) reasons to believe in God, but it&#039;s not just that we don&#039;t *need* mysteries, it&#039;s that there&#039;s no such thing (in the mystical sense). Feelings of awe are just feelings, not indications of something metaphysical.


Christian theologians have always been better at dealing with the real issues of religion. Jewish religious scholarship has always primarily concerned itself with legalism, with questions of belief a distant second. All of the kiruv books parrot Christian thinkers without attribution. Well, the better ones do. The rest parrot Christian fundamentalists and Creationists, also without attribution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Meaning, we find specific things in nature and feel God must have done THAT.&quot;


This argument can never work. If you say &quot;specific&quot; things in nature were done by God, that automatically implies that there are &quot;specific&quot; other things that were not done (created) by God. And if so, well, who/what created them?


The only argument that can work is that &lt;b&gt;everything&lt;/b&gt; was created by God. Then you can discuss if God is involved in every single small change thereafter or if some things change &quot;on their own&quot; (as God &quot;programmed&quot; them to do).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; Fink,

Leaving OJ aside for a moment, I think God will only become obsolete if the reason we believe is due to a form of Paley &quot;Design&quot; type argument. Meaning, we find specific things in nature and feel God must have done THAT. Then we find a reason for THAT, as G3 mentions and we no longer need God. I enjoyed Edward Fesser&#039;s take on extrinsic and intrinsic here. http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2014/01/the-pointlessness-of-jerry-coyne.html

An intrinsic view doesn&#039;t necessarily lead to G3&#039;s conclusions. It says, yes we found explanations for XYZ. It says, we don&#039;t necessarily need mysteries. It says, when we look at the picture, we see a direction to existence and chemical reactions are not just there by a fluke. 

In my opinion, Christians are at forefront of dealing with the God question while Jews are still concentrating on the most trivial of things in the Talmud as if it has any relevance. There are the writings of Robert Boyle, Polkinghorne, Mcgrath, MacIntyre, Plantinga etc. etc. One may not reach their same conclusions, but they are at least the ones deaing with it in a sophisticated manner. I see nothing substantial to compare within the OJ world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That makes it sound like the skeptics are willfully denying evidence which points to God. It’s not that mysteries are certainly not caused by God, but that there is no reason to privilege “God” as an explanation for stuff we don’t understand. Maybe it was God. Maybe it was fairies. Maybe it was some simple (or complex) thing that we haven’t stumbled across just yet.

No. That&#039;s not what I meant at all. It&#039;s a question that is raised and different groups have different answers.

Why are those things mysteries? They evoke powerful emotions, but those reactions aren’t really mysterious.

We just mean the things that are not deterministic and vary from person to person. Gopnik is talking about the fuzziness of life that is beyond the clearly material. I&#039;m just going with what he is talking about.

It already has. The Chassidim won, the Maharal won, in general the mystical version has won. In the face of a scientific worldview, in a world where we understand a lot of how the universe works and assume that, given enough data and processing power, we could understand everything, there is no room for a religious belief system that has to explain how it functions in the world we live in. Belief today works much better when it demands absolute certainty and shunts the mechanics off into a mysterious mystical realm that we can’t possibly understand.



That&#039;s not what I am talking about. It&#039;s not mystical as much as it is not certain. Chasidus / Maharal version of God is a form of certainty. You are talking about the approach to rituals. It&#039;s a dichotomy. Mystics make belief in God into an obvious conclusion. Rationalists make God into a mystery.


As for your last three points some are handled supra the others are indeed questions of neuroscience and I don&#039;t claim to have an answer. Gopnik ignores it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; The skeptics shrug their shoulders and say they don’t what it is, but it’s not God

That makes it sound like the skeptics are willfully denying evidence which points to God. It’s not that mysteries are certainly not caused by God, but that there is no reason to privilege “God” as an explanation for stuff we don’t understand. Maybe it was God. Maybe it was fairies. Maybe it was some simple (or complex) thing that we haven’t stumbled across just yet.

&gt; Both groups are aware of the mysteries of love, music, art, human frailty and wonder

Why are those things mysteries? They evoke powerful emotions, but those reactions aren’t really mysterious. 

&gt; There is a trend towards a more mysterious and unexplainable version of belief. Will it catch on in Orthodox Judaism? It seems unlikely

It already has. The Chassidim won, the Maharal won, in general the mystical version has won. In the face of a scientific worldview, in a world where we understand a lot of how the universe works and assume that, given enough data and processing power, we could understand everything, there is no room for a religious belief system that has to explain how it functions in the world we live in.  Belief today works much better when it demands absolute certainty and shunts the mechanics off into a mysterious mystical realm that we can’t possibly understand.

&gt; The new God is a God of mystery and wonder. We still marvel at sunsets. We still bask in the glow of love. We still feel our hearts soar when we listen to our music. 

That we find certain things pretty, or that we’re wired to have strong emotional attachments to family to facilitate the survival of our children, or even that a given set of sounds triggers the release of certain nuero-chemicals has nothing to do with a mysterious God.

There are deep notes, below the threshold of what we’re consciously aware of hearing, that trigger feeling of dread and awe. Medieval churches often had pipes on their organs that produced these inaudible notes, and these would be used to evoke emotions from the worshippers at appropriate points during services. We don’t fully understand how sound triggers emotions, but that doesn’t make it mystical.

&gt; We are not completely deterministic. We believe we can improve our lives and the lives of others. 

But we live in a deterministic universe, aside from some quantum randomness. Our lives *are* deterministic.

&gt; The mysteries of joy and pleasure and happiness

Why are those mysteries? What’s mysterious about pleasure? Certain activities are rewarded with dopamine and serotonin because those activities have historically increased our chances of survival.]]></description>
