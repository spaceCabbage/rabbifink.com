		<description><![CDATA[Sure in this case it allows some women to be &quot;observant&quot; but it very likely isn&#039;t going to cause a tidal wave of women to suddenly realize that orthodox Judaism is the answer.  But in general, this lax approach to halachah and tradition that says we should look for all leniences and change this and this and this and we should change it now, regardless of what the rest of the modern orthodox world thinks, is likely going to lead to a dismissive view of halacha and tradition for the majority, and will likely be encouraged by those who want a &quot;kosher&quot; way to have an easier watered down orthodox Judaism.

As for your second point, I do t think you are applying that aphorism appropriately or else someone in the last 2000 years would have ruled women can wear tefillin.]]></description>

First of all, this isn&#039;t a case of people looking to be &quot;free from observance&quot;, it is a case of people looking for observance.

Second of all, chazal anticipated these kinds of things and at least twice reminded us that כח דהיתרא עדיף (TB Eruvin 72B, TB Beitzah 2B).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here is the problem with your entire approach in my opinion.  I know you see all the Jews leaving Judaism and you are looking for a solution to turn the tide.  So it seems you think that perhaps by being more open-minded and permissive, that suddenly Judaism is going to have a resurgence, or at the least bring many more people back into the fold.  But if you were ever successful in getting your way, you have no way of knowing what will actually occur.  You hope it will turn out for the best, but it may be the opposite or simply have no effect at all on assimilation rates.  I think if you really wanted to bring Jews back to Judaism, the answer lies in providing as much logical proof as possible that Orthodox Judaism is correct.  Whether women have more roles in the synagogue and can put on tefillin is very likely going to do nothing but water down observance from people who are looking for more and more heters to be free from observance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[#2 pretty much captures his tone. It has been an ongoing theme on this site: Fink is never wrong and never says anything wrong. He wants other Orthodox Rabbis (right-wing) to include him in conversation, yet when anyone engages him here, they are wrong, or their views are odd. It doesn&#039;t matter what I express or how I express it. There&#039;s never a counterpoint, always just a rude remark. I give up. This is not a space for a conversation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please stop using women as pawns to attack Orthodoxy. This is a similar sort of problem that I have with Democrats: They love framing themselves as pro-women, yet don&#039;t treat their own wives with respect. At the end of the day, I am only convinced they want to defeat Republicans and pretend to court us to further their agenda. You have made it quite plain in other posts that you don&#039;t feel respected in Orthodox circles, e.g. other Rabbis advise students not to read or heed your views. You don&#039;t seem to understand that this is a vicious cycle; the more you continue to attempt to dismantle centuries of wisdom, the more Orthodox Jews will steer clear of you. If you consistently find yourself in the minority, rather than insist that you&#039;re right and the other Rabbis (including the Sages) are wrong, perhaps it&#039;s time to humble yourself and be willing to listen and learn. Whatever path you choose is no concern of mine, but as a woman, I will ask that you stop using us to make your point. We don&#039;t need you to speak for us, and I especially do not appreciate great Rabbis being disrespected on my behalf.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Talmud is hardly unequivocal.  It is machlokes in a mishna whether one should or should not teach his daughters Torah.  I don&#039;t buy your premise that there has been a trend of loosening a prohibition against women learning Torah.  There is a machlokes in the Mishna about whether it is a good thing or a bad thing to teach one&#039;s daughters Torah.  Without the Rishonim and Codes there would be no clear psak on which opinion in the Mishna is accepted and even according to the opinion that it is bad thing there is no clear prohibition.  Furthermore, I don&#039;t know of any place in the Talmud where it says that a grown woman cannot learn Torah, the issue is the teaching of youth.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Talmud is hardly unequivocal.  It is machlokes in a mishna whether one should or should not teach his daughters Torah.  I don&#8217;t buy your premise that there has been a trend of loosening a prohibition against women learning Torah.  There is a machlokes in the Mishna about whether it is a good thing or a bad thing to teach one&#8217;s daughters Torah.  Without the Rishonim and Codes there would be no clear psak on which opinion in the Mishna is accepted and even according to the opinion that it is bad thing there is no clear prohibition.  Furthermore, I don&#8217;t know of any place in the Talmud where it says that a grown woman cannot learn Torah, the issue is the teaching of youth.</p>
