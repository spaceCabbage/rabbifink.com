		<description><![CDATA[Benignuman: 

It is never an issue of a wife breaching a kesuba contract (where you are arguing she could at most lose the kesuba money.) The husband&#039;s right to maintain the marriage (even against his wife&#039;s wishes) is not granted to him in the kesuba. It is granted to him directly by Torah Law. Therefore he needn&#039;t divorce her, even if she wants a divorce, when Torah Law states he has no obligation to divorce her.

So it is not a matter of &lt;i&gt;&quot;a wholesale license to do whatever you want to them&quot;&lt;/i&gt; due to a contractual breach, it is a matter of exercising a right specifically granted by the Torah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is absurd reasoning.  If she is &quot;breaching&quot; the contract, she can&#039;t lose more than what she is entitled under the contract.  Where in a halacha do we find that if the other party breaches a contract you have a wholesale license to do whatever you want to them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re clearly in the grip of strong emotions, so I don&#039;t expect anything to make a dent on you, but:

Huvi didn&#039;t fail Duvi or kick him when he was down; he did that to her. He and his family deliberately concealed his health condition and continued this deception through the engagement and into the marriage, solely to benefit them, without any regard for her. (I&#039;m sure they told themselves and each other that she didn&#039;t need to know, it was better for her this way, and other lies to ease their guilt.) 

&quot;In sickness and in health&quot; never includes &quot;even if one of you is hiding a major health issue from the other right now because it&#039;s likely a deal-killer.&quot; Just like &quot;for richer or for poorer&quot; doesn&#039;t include &quot;I&#039;m letting you believe that I&#039;ve got plenty in the bank when really I&#039;m up to my ears in debt.&quot; Major deceit is grounds for divorce in secular law, Christian law and yes, Jewish law. Marriage is serious; we don&#039;t allow one person to take advantage of the other&#039;s ignorance to make his own life better.

Also, he&#039;s not DYING, as you put it. Educate yourself. MS is a chronic condition; people live for many, many years with it. It absolutely affects quality of life when symptoms hit. MS requires medicine, therapy and lifestyle controls to manage, even at times when the symptoms are in remission. It takes genuine commitment from your spouse to deal with the stress both remission and relapse bring to a marriage. That&#039;s not something that everyone can handle, and you don&#039;t discover whether you can handle it until you&#039;re actually dealing with it. And that&#039;s when your spouse has been open with you about his condition.

I&#039;m not surprised reconciliation failed. What kind of marriage can stand up to a deliberate lie about major health issues? More, what kind of father wants to deprive his son of a loving wife who can be there for him in his illness?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful post and truly tragic. I just want to mention something that bothers me from following these stories: I understand that is horrible and wrong to withhold a get and we don&#039;t have to be dan l&#039;kaf zechus that &quot;maybe he had a good reason&quot; because yes, it&#039;s never okay to withhold a get. There is a different kind of dan l&#039;kaf zechus though that I feel is in order and woefully lacking. Please don&#039;t assume that a guy is a monster or a horrible person for withholding a get. Yes, he is doing something terrible and it&#039;s not okay, but don&#039;t forget that it&#039;s often coming from a place of pain and not of wickedness. I have watched a sweet young man torn to shreds by an aggressive and vindictive ex and her PR campaign. My friend was wrong and we told him so, but he&#039;s not the monster he&#039;s painted as. Really. Let&#039;s do what we have to do to convince him (I&#039;m talking in general here, no specific case in mind) to give the get,  without believing every piece of character assassination we are fed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jews do not take vows to support each other in sickness and in health.  Open your siddur and check.  A wedding is a contractual relationship and you are not allowed to withhold information relevant to the other party in the contract.  This man did not contract his disease after marriage, he hid it before marriage.  If the situation were reversed, he could divorce her and no one would stop him.  It&#039;s not like these two people fell in love and devoted themselves to each other and then one was struck by a challenging disease.  Their marriage was arranged by others, they met each other a few times and had some brief conversation.  One of the rules of this system is that serious background checks take the place of things like getting to know each other over a period of months or years.  The background checks failed.

http://www.come-and-hear.com/kethuboth/kethuboth_77.html

No one is arguing that this is a lovely thing for her to do and surely her husband would prefer a wife who loves him and wants to remain with him and care for him.  Indeed, he deserves such as wife.  This is why he should divorce his current wife and seek a kind and noble woman like that who loves him.  The woman he is married clearly does not love him and wishes to leave him.  Why would anyone try to compel her to stay?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Incredible nerve you have in making that gross stereotype generalization. Have you analyzed every mother and father in the world? How about if I tell you most children of single mothers grow up to become drug addicts, but most children of single fathers (widowers) grow up just fine?
That&#039;s exactly the type of double standard feminists seem to have no trouble applying. And that is exactly why the court system is horribly biased against men. And that is exactly why men  WILL continue to use the get, as an ace in the hole. Not to gain an unfair advantage. But to level the playing field. Unless and until the court system shows some awareness of the imbalance, and makes sincere efforts towards restoring fairness in the process, I cant imagine any reason why any man would simply give a get, just like that.
You&#039;ve said before that you &quot;think feminism is great.&quot; So you probably cant see this point, no matter how many people notice it. People cannot see beyond their own paradigms without shifting them.]]></description>

So, while territories may be bad, a factory built in Area C that employs locals at a higher wage is not something to go to PR war over.  And while Agunos should be granted a get, this story has not developed to the point that a BD (including R Perr) has declared her an aguna.

		<description><![CDATA[What if the woman was making outlandish accusations about the father molesting his children??? We can agree that if it was true then the guy is awful for more than one reason. But if it was not true and she was making that up??? Is that not the worst thing ever??? Does that not add a second thought regarding this whole situation? Is that not crossing lines that are beyond?? Think about being the father knowing someone is making up such claims about their children. It would be awful. It is hard to judge these situations unless knowing all facts. Signs went around saying &quot;a get is not a weapon&quot;. Neither are children!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;Now we can all breathe a sigh of relief. Clearly, the message has been heard: The Orthodox Jewish Community will not tolerate recalcitrant husbands who use the get as leverage or a weapon against their wives.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;


You got the message all wrong, Eliyahu. She had to capitulate to her husband&#039;s demands before she got a Get. The message was that a Get will &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; be given unconditionally upon demand.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cheating on your husband is not grounds for losing custody.
If more men were primary parents, more men would get custody. False abuse claims are very, very uncommon.
There is no excuse to withhold a get.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If the details are as presented, I could see this being a case where the marriage could be annulled on the grounds of &quot;meqach ta&#039;us -- a transaction made in error&quot;. This was a pre-existing condition which you say was willfully withheld from the bride. If we had a man with  a backbone like Rav Moshe Feinstein&#039;s (c.f. IM EhE 4:13), I would be more confident of a positive outcome.]]></description>
