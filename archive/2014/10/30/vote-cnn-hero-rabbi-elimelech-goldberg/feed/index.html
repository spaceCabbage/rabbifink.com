		<description><![CDATA[THANK YOU SO MUCH  for this wonderful piece.  As personal recipients of Rabbi Goldberg&#039;s exceptional chesed and wisdom, it is incredibly gratifying to see that so many others agree.  It is difficult to describe what it is that Rabbi Goldberg does.  And the magnitude and far reaching effects o it.  But as the mother of a very medically challenged child i can tell you that it is touching and it is treasured and it is beyond special.  So many organizations will hand our a balloon or a sweet and a smile (all absolutely valuable, please do not get me wrong) but they are temporary.  They fade.  One of the biggest challenges to a chronically ill child is that he is not, nor ever has been in control of his life.  His life is part of the public domain.  And he is pushed and prodded and poked all the time.  He is a patient, he is vulnerable, he is an unfortunate.  but to us, he is solid gold.  he is a priceless neshama that has come into this world to travel an unsteady unpredictable journey.  And he doe st with incredible courage and bravery and grace.  And we lose sight of that.  Rabbi Goldberg never does.  To him every child is special.  They come from a very special place on High.  i am so grateful that we can widen the awareness and give homage and tribute to a very special messenger of G-d.  Thank you once again.]]></description>
