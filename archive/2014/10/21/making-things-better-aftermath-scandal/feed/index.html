		<description><![CDATA[The specific lifestyle or culture that is idealized is the idea that Jews can rely on each other. NO WHERE is taking government funds even remotely discussed. Even Aron Kotler failed to mention it. Only people who already complain about it would connect the two, and its not connected. Brooklyn is also full of beggars, and people there work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That has nothing to do with the article, it is a result of mentioning the name of the township LAKEWOOD. Gentiles wouldn&#039;t make such comments, they don&#039;t know what Lakewood is; it&#039;s a bunch of Jews commenting their own rancid slander.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aside from the bizarre comparison, I would encourage the author and js36 to actually read the NY Times article. The article speaks nothing about institutional reliance. All it says is that beggars know where to go; to the one place they know where they can rely on a kind hearted and charitable community. Any other ideas purportedly espoused are projected from sensational bloggers on to the article. If you see Lakewood in a negative light from the article, you need to go back and read it again, cause you missed the point. It is the farthest thing from the D.C. scandal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the action taken in DC by the Rabbi was far worse than the other two items mentioned above, it was only done by 1 person(though the RCA is not blameless either).  The issues in Rockland and Lakewood are institutional problems whereby in Rockland County, the Jewish leadership has no idea how to properly interact with non-Jews in a way that shows mutual respect for each others communities. In Lakewood, institutional poverty is a major drag on the entire orthodox community and puts us in a bad light when families and yeshivas have to mooch of government and communal assistance.]]></description>
