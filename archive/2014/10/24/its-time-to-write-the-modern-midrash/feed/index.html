		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to answer it myself, since you&#039;re so intent on ducking it: 
Because even you yourself wouldn&#039;t believe anything you write.
And that also explains why no one writes &quot;modern midrash.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought it was a matter of moving the base, or enlarging the base, that those rabbis were extrapolating from. Which allows for drift. Right now, the basic communal gestalt is a region around a fixed set of sources.

For what it&#039;s worth, when I write a derashah, I try to do what I mentally think of interpolate rather than extrapolate. To explain the mashal, not that anyone should care that much how Micha Berger darshens...

If you start with only one point and you continue the line of thought for an inch or two, you could go in any direction. And if the original point was near the border, you could end up past the edge of the map. But if you demand two points, then you only have the lines between two points that you are able to connect with your derashah. It&#039;s not free rein. So, I try to find two sources from which I can expound an idea before presenting one of my own novellae in public.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;You cannot supplement without replacing?&quot; That&#039;s ridiculous. Never mind midrash, if this principle is true, why even deliver an original drash? You might conflict with a Torah giant and lead some poor Jewish youth astray. Please. Rabbi Fink is a million times correct in calling for Modern Midrash because the sea of Torah is infinite, and the helmsmen of modern commentary will distinguish between truth and falsehood. You don&#039;t like a story? Say so. If your points are valid, many people will hasten to agree with you. But don&#039;t invalidate the attempt to say something original and meaningful. I haven&#039;t seen Noah yet, so I can&#039;t comment on that, but I loved Ushpizin for example. That was a Modern Midrash for me. I learned from it, and I enjoyed it. It didn&#039;t supplant anything I learned in Shas or Chassidus, but it certainly augmented, and I was grateful for that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Every single week rabbis give drashos that provide their own spin on the parsha. They pick and choose midrashim and peirushim to support their point. This is how it has always been done. Read Abravanel on the last two parshas, and what Nechama Leibowitz has to say about the origins of his rather Marxist utopian ideas that he reads into the text.... 600 years ago. 

It seems to me that what&#039;s being proposed here is a midrashic format for writing Torah commentary. It&#039;s a question of form, not content.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But moderns, especially moderns who invent their own midrash, are also capable of reading their agendas into the text they interpret. The ancients didn&#039;t do that. Alternatively, they may have, but the agendas from 1500 years ago have either become lost or become the de facto mainstream, and are this imperceptible as agendas.
The issue of progression v regression is entirely unrelated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Except I didn&#039;t originally say nisqatnu hadoros or yeridas hadoros, you brought the buzzwords into the conversation. I said something far more specific. I opened with mention of  the loss of Sinaitic Culture. Then I followed up with spelling out that Abayei and Rav Papa were talking about feelings and commitment rather than knowledge. So, I have no idea why you&#039;re talking of &quot;a lot of things to a lot [of] people&quot;. And you then talk about knowledge, when I was talking about something more mimetic, experiential and emotional.

And you still are not even touching my observation that it&#039;s generally accepted (and pretty obvious) that there was some kind of fundamental loss in the inarticulatable parts of Torah caused by the Shoah and the relocation of the centers of Orthodox life, such that there is a &quot;qitun hador&quot; of the current generation, regardless of what you believe is the norm. Nor did you touch my claim that there isn&#039;t enough respect for authority for ideas that have sufficient truthiness can be trashed from the coalescing contemporary Orthodox communal culture once they&#039;re put out into the marketplace of ideas.


This is a FAR greater loss than our loss in linguistics. We cannot be as sure we&#039;re capturing values that are consistent with Torah rather than accelerating our loss of that Sinaitic Culture with stories that teach accretions that contradict it. We cannot even be sure our peer review would succeed in eliminating them from the &quot;canon&quot; of Modern Medrash even when we do detect such inconsistencies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nistaknu hadoros means a lot of things to a lot people. The only sense in which I agree that we are worse off than we were 1000 years ago is that we have fewer experts in Biblical linguistics. We still have them, but they are not considered Gedoylim so they have no voice. Aggadita had many different purposes and many different methodologies. Moderns are certainly capable of Sefer HaYashar style story telling.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again, you&#039;re asserting that yeridas hadoros / nisqatnu hadoros as I understand it (which I didn&#039;t really spell out) is overrated, without presenting or proving an authentic alternative. You dismiss the two points I made about our generation being less plugged in to aggadita and mimetics -- which you want to turn into formal aggadita -- as simply unimportant parts of my post.

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; Leiman&#039;s essay is consistent with the diminishing additions model. And for that matter, so is the Rambam. Kellmer argues from silence: if the Rambam expected his period to be lesser than earlier ones, why does he invoke the contigencies that caused it? It could simply be that the Rambam believes in yeridas hadoros (which, after all, is an uncontested position in both talmuds), but believes it is an inevitable product of history. Things get lost over time, the number of negative situations that cause cultural drift will inevitably far outpace revivals.

Second, we aren&#039;t discussing halachic process here; this modern medrash would be aggadita. When it comes to halakhah, we have rules like halakhah kebasra&#039;i -- that our being atop the shoulders of giants and studying and comparing their works may give the later decisor more legal authority, even if we do consider him lesser. Abayei and R&#039; Papa discuss mesiras nefesh and yir&#039;as Shamayim (self sacrifice and living in an awe of the One in heaven), not knowledge.

Third, regardless of yeridas hadoros in general, are you disagreeing with R/Dr Haym Soloveitchik&#039;s thesis that we now rely more on texts than Jews did 100 years ago because we are still reconstructing the Torah culture after a cataclysmic rupture? Our particular generation is one that is culturally impoverished, one that has not held on to the innate values that we&#039;re supposed to be learning at our mother&#039;s knees and from the society we mix in.

Last, this generation is also very weak in being able to weed out bad ideas. Between a constant litany of incidents that shake one&#039;s faith in the rabbinic authorities (real or supposed) and the democratization of communication caused by the internet, there is a strong trend among the rank and file to ignore such guidance. For example, look how YidTech is trying to sell the Shabbos App without a teshuvah from a known poseiq, or even an article from a theoretician. (R&#039; Herschel Schachter makes a similar argument about Partnership Minyanim and Do It Yourself halakhah.) They presume their target audience will take their blog-style arguments and turn them into practice.

And the same would happen to &quot;medrashim&quot; that tell stories that fit today&#039;s zeitgeist, and therefore have sufficient truthiness, even if they are inconsistent with Torah values.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;...all the Orthodox Jews who actually think that Torah supports liberal values.&quot;
Yes, all twenty-seven of them. But more to the point, I at no point - not here, and never anywhere else - said orthodox Judaism must be synonymous with conservative values.  You just invented a complete red herring, my friend. But since you raised it, I will say this: Simply as a point of fact, orthodox JEWS do identify with those values. You can&#039;t argue that, just like one cant argue that reform Jews identify with liberal values. Look at the voting demographics for orthodox neighborhoods, and really, you can&#039;t seriously debate this.   As to whether orthodox JUDAISM must identify with liberal or conservative values - the matter very much depends upon whether Tanach or Shas define orthodox Judaism. 
As for your previous one-sentence, non-responsive answer - you cannot supplement without replacing. That&#039;s why its never been done. Believe me, it&#039;s not because no one in the past 1000 years ever thought, &quot;Hey, you know, I can apply this verse to Henry VII!&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a side-note, I do not know of anyone (Orthodox) who disagrees with nisqatnu hadoros. There may be questions about what the implications of the idea would be on halachic authority, but this isn&#039;t a question of halachic authority.

But in any case, you didn&#039;t answer my question. You&#039;re saying that we need new/more medrash, that the old stuff may not speak to today&#039;s Jew. I&#039;m asking for how you check when you&#039;re creating an apt metaphor for Sinaitic values, and when you&#039;re incorporating un-Jewish values and giving them a false air of authenticity. Particularly since you&#039;re trying to cover those areas where we today are out of line with the past, although the question must be asked in general.

This is parallel to my comment on &quot;Keeping the Orthodox Orthodox&quot;. I have nothing against your thesis, I just can&#039;t judge it altogether until I hear more about your checks-n-balances. One shouldn&#039;t promote writing new medrash without explaining how they are making sure that what gets written really is new medrash.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This post is not wrong in the abstract, but it is in its proposed execution.
That is, it&#039;s true the ancients had no problem midrashically interpreting Torah to meet their own current conditions. Thus there are countless midrashim referring to Rome, which is obviously completely out of date today (despite all stretches to make it now mean &quot;Western Civilization.&quot;) The whole concept of the &quot;4 kingdoms&quot; has to be seriously re-examined. The problem is, of course, the same old problem which has been present for more than a thousand years - how do you throw out the bathwater without throwing out the baby? No one has figured out a way yet.
 Once you replace chazal&#039;s interpretation with your own, its a short ride to replacing their halachas too. There&#039;s a reasons men like Ibn Ezra and Rashbam are often seen as the forerunner to academic [and hence, Reform] Judaism. If לא תבשל גדי בחלב אמו is simply one of the laws enjoining cruelty to animals, why on Earth is anyone waiting 6 hours after chicken to drink a glass of milk? You&#039;ll notice that the hamon am of orthodoxy still use Rashi and Ramban to understand Torah, and for the most part are blissfully unaware of other approaches. The ones most aware of these other approaches, and the ones most apt to cite them, are often merely orthoprax. In other words, your post is basically championing Reform, or let us say, Conservatism. [Keep in mind you&#039;re a public figure Rabbi, by the way. You don&#039;t have the luxury of musing like private citizens. You keep talking like this and you&#039;ll be, at &quot;best&quot;, an Emanuel Rackman/Yitz Greenberg neither fish nor fowl character. Hey, if that&#039;s what you want....] 
Micha Berger also makes an important related point, and your one line answer [like all one line answers] doesn&#039;t answer anything. Anyone I&#039;ve ever seen speaking of &quot;modern midrash&quot; invariably, without exception, comes from the left wing perspective. Feminism, wage and hour agitators, and with your Noach film, environmentalism. There&#039;s other examples. Can&#039;t you see how tiresome this is for the majority of orthodox Jews, who don&#039;t share these liberal ideas? Infusing Torah with politics is not wise.
Bottom line: I&#039;m sympathetic to what you say, but it&#039;s not orthodox.]]></description>
