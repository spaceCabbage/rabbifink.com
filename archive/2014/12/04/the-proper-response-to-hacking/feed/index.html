		<description><![CDATA[(quote) &#062;&quot;When hackers release pirated movies, it’s on us to go to the theater and pay to see the film.&quot;
(end quote)

You hit the nail on the head right there.  I think the whole &quot;hacking&quot; thing was a publicity stunt engineered by Sony to drum up interest in a ridiculous movie--an alleged comedy about the dictator of North Korea!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No. The comparison is borderline offensive. The athlete is performing. It&#039;s art. The purpose of the competition is for the spectator. So no, it is not voteurism and no it is not a one way relationship. The athlete is inviting you to watch and generally is being paid handsomely. Stealing private information and reveling in its exposure is not only a one way relationship, it&#039;s an abusive relationship, if you could even call it a relationship.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(Watching) sports is voyeuristic at its core: You&#039;re watching someone, generally on TV, attempt some athletic feat, and getting a thrill out of it. The relationship is one-way, in the sense that the athletes normally have no idea who is watching them. The only difference is the athlete consents, and generally desires to be watched. If the athlete messes up spectacularly, it gets watched over and over, with train-wreck appeal, much like this case.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Moral of the story: Hug your IT person.

And your point is silly: We live in a voyeuristic society for better or for worse. If you truly wanted to rid society, or even yourself, of voyeurism, &#039;Avert your gaze&#039; would have to apply to pretty much all news, much of your Facebook postings, sports, etc..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The media is just a conduit for the public. 

You see the same thing about terrorism. If a young Israeli died in car accident, nobody bats an eyelash. Media doesn&#039;t run the story because nobody cares. If an Arab stabs an Israeli (or vice versa), it becomes an international incident because of the media, and the public appetite for such a story.]]></description>
