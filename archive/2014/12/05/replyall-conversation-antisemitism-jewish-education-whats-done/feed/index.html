		<description><![CDATA[Do you really think that discussing anti-semitism in regard to xenophobia and other cultures gets to its true  nature and root? Isn&#039;t there something  unique about this age old hatred that effects Jews wherever they go? Is this an issue that can  be resolved the same way racism can? If all hatred, racism and bigotry in the world would be removed, wouldn&#039;t  the timeless words of the torah &quot;eisav sonei l&#039;yaakov&quot; still remain?  I would love to see you write an article that discusses the uniqueness of this issue. 
P.S I come from a sephardic home, and anti-semitism has always been a topic of discussion, and something my family and sephardic friends discuss more than my ashkenazic friends. I dont think it has to do with Sephardic vs. Ashkenaz, but rather, how long ago the family immigrated. Sephardic Iranian Jews who are first generation Americans will feel this more strongly than their ashkenaz friends. Ashkenaz Jews who are second generation americans,  will feel this more strongly than Syrian Jews who may be  third generation americans...]]></description>
