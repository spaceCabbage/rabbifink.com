		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi, you are making this very difficult.  English is the language I am fluent in so I do not know what other way to convey that since you are &quot;IN THE KNOW&quot; and have &quot;people on the ground&quot; as your sources you know this an ongoing IDF investigation and NOTHING as far as cause of death has been determined.
Again, this communication was as a courtesy I chose to extend, I am not obligated to give you any information.  You are wrong and knowingly spreading false information.
Also, thanks for the hypercritical warning! 
Have a meaningful, insightful and truthful Elul]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, are you either a complete moron or a rasha?
You have gotten wrong information, I did try to say this (above) gently but you clearly feel, so arrogantly, that you are in the right..  You don&#039;t have any shaychas to the family and no real valid information.  I strongly ask that you drop this.

If you all feel the need to express opinions on David&#039;s death, get the facts...Oh wait, you can&#039;t they are not confirmed by the IDF!
If you feel the need to express opinions on David&#039;s life, THAT would be most meaningful!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tzedek.org.au  the Australian advocacy group for Jewish victims of sexual abuse.  Started by a very brave man, Manny Waks from Melbourne who was also a victim of abuse.  Manny chose to go to the authorities with his parents support.  Sadly, they paid a very high price for exposing the predators that were lurking within their community, so much so that Manny&#039;s parents have moved to Israel because they were completely shunned.  May G-d bless Manny,his family, and all the survivors who stand up and take on the evil that is child sexual abuse and may they go from strength to strength, from pain to peace and may they succeed in their fight to see the perpetrators punished.  My heart goes out to David&#039;s family. May they live a long life and may David&#039;s memory be a blessing.  Baruch dayan haEmet.]]></description>
