		<description><![CDATA[Let me start by recognizing, Rav, that what you&#039;re proposing is coming from a good place.  You want to make a positive contribution to the yiddishkeit of a segment of the klal that gets overlooked because of the assumption that its members must be doing well enough to fend for themselves.  Your point that just because someone qualifies as a &quot;young professional&quot; doesn&#039;t mean he or she is rolling in piles disposable income, especially in a town like LA, is correct and well taken.  

All of that said, I found all of my defenses going up instantly and involuntarily while I read the post.  Part of the reason is probably that even though I understand rationally that &quot;young professional&quot; doesn&#039;t mean &quot;limitless income,&quot; I don&#039;t understand that emotionally.  The phrase &quot;young professional,&quot; like &quot;upper-middle class,&quot; is freighted with affective baggage that keeps people from hearing it as a neutral descriptor.  Part of the baggage concerns money, but another part has to do with the perception that &quot;Millenials&quot; (speaking of baggage laden terms) are already entitled and privileged as it is, so your request comes off like a plea for corporate welfare while ignoring other members of the community that are less visible.  

The foregoing are perceptions that I have that are, 1) like all stereotypes, flawed in their creation of an &quot;average (and non-existent) type&quot; vs. real individuals and that are 2) no doubt engendered by some personal sinas hinam that I have toward &quot;young professionals&quot; (neither word describes me very accurately) and thus are my problem, not theirs.  I don&#039;t think these perceptions are unique to me, and, if you&#039;re going to make this type of appeal, I hope you&#039;ll keep them in mind as you do so.  No one likes the word &quot;marketing&quot; but...

Finally, while I admit that what I mention above is my problem and not a fair criticism of the situation of many young Jewish professionals, a more substantive critique can (and should) be directed at the practice of charging for attendance during the Yamim.  I&#039;m aware of all the reasons for the practice and, given how most shuls fund their operations, most of the reasons are completely defensible.  It might be time to rethink funding in a way that makes  the Yamim available to everyone.  Speaking of perceptions, I remember the look on a notzri friend of mine&#039;s face when he heard the words &quot;atonement&quot; and &quot;$1300 per seat&quot; used in the same sentence.  Yes, I know that he was importing his own ideas of what &quot;atonement&quot; means on to a Jewish context, but, like it or not, most non-observant American Jews, especially if they have limited hinuch, see the world through the same Christian lens that Christians do and will have a similar reaction.  This reaction may end up doing more to keep Jews from attending services than the price tag.]]></description>
