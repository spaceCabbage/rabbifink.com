		<description><![CDATA[First, I can see from other articles that the Rabbi is educated in Torah and secular topics. I respect his erudition.
The last line of the article was &quot;Let’s start the conversation.&quot;, so I&#039;m doing just that in an honest, open way. This is not a bashing session.

I have family members that suffer from &quot;clinical depression&quot;. I&#039;m a fairly learned person in Torah and in physical sciences (I&#039;ve been educated in Yeshivot, attend Daf Yomi and have a degree in Aerospace engineering).
The thing that really has me honestly perplexed and very disturbed is these two items:
1. There are very &quot;heavy hitter&quot; Torah commentators from hundreds of years ago (who were supposedly much more spiritually advanced than us) that claim ALL illness (mental and physical) are the result of averot (sin). Now, that doesn&#039;t jive at all with this article. And that leaves an obvious problem for anyone honestly trying to resolve Torah and &quot;science&quot;.
2. Now, read this till the end before you judge: One of the family members I mentioned above leads me to believe that many cases of &quot;diagnosed clinical depression&quot; are false, much the way it is being discovered recently that as much as 30-40% of diagnoses of ADD/ADHD are false. This person was on various cocktails for years (from &quot;professionals&quot;). The cycle was: Got better for short time, then got worse than when she started on the cocktail. I &quot;put my foot down&quot; and &quot;forced&quot; her to go cold turkey and quit medication altogether and just continue counseling (no meds). Guess what: She just got better and better and she&#039;s exercising, dieting, attending shiurim (this is a year later, so it&#039;s not just a fad). Is she perfectly happy all the time - certainly not, but she&#039;s light-years above where she was when she was being medicated into deeper depression (or oblivion). I&#039;ll never forget the terminology used by the psychiatrists: &quot;Well, it&#039;s not working with X set of meds, so let&#039;s try something else and see how it goes&quot;. This is AFTER the same cycle for YEARS. Well, I figured, why not experiment with dropping the meds altogether. His guess seems no better than mine (this was not the only person to prescribe meds). And as I pointed out, what I guessed worked! Many of you can probably guess who &quot;she&quot; is.

I just want the parent/spouse/child of the depressed to know that the doctors are clueless in many cases. In direct contradiction to the author&#039;s advice, I advise you to invest the painful/exhausting effort doing what you know is right for the depressed if you have a clue/insight. If not, try to find out - you know that person better than the doctor. Do NOT take the doctor&#039;s advice as &quot;irrefutable truth&quot;.
NOTE: This does not mean I think there is no such thing as an identifiable chemical imbalance in the brain as a real disease, but &quot;brain waves&quot; are hardly conclusive evidence of anything at all. The brain waves just prove that depressed people emanate certain electromagnetic patterns. The CAUSE of the brain waves can be any one of a number of things. I&#039;m sure some of you have read about certain high-stress situations and/or drugs causing brain waves that are for all intents and purposes identical to &quot;clinically depressed people&quot;. The scientific &quot;evidence&quot; and understanding is FAR from conclusive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My feeling on the other articles is the same. In theory, it&#039;s great to do away with the stigmas. I just can&#039;t blame anyone for not wanting to marry someone who was abused or is depressed, because I know what they&#039;ll have to try to work through. If I knew it would all be ok in the end, maybe I&#039;d think differently. 

I&#039;m not going to defend the shidduch system, it didn&#039;t work for me and I&#039;m happy I met my wife in a somewhat more natural way. I knew her well before she told me what she was going through and in the shidduch system that likely wouldn&#039;t have happened. I&#039;m fortunate to have my wife and I wouldn&#039;t do much different if I could go back in time, but again I can understand not wanting to go through this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking about this for a long time, and I even wrote a little bit about it years ago on my blog.  The stigma against mental illness and against psycho-pharmacology is tragic.

But here&#039;s something that occurred to me late last night. We should stop saying that a depressed person who commits suicide &quot;killed himself.&quot; Instead, let&#039;s say he &quot;died of depression.&quot; Maybe it&#039;s &quot;just semantics&quot; but sometimes a subtle shift in language helps.  It will help people realize that depression can be, and all too often is, a fatal illness. The mechanism of how the the death occurred is, to me, less important than the actual cause of it.

I remember when Philip Seymour Hoffman died, a friend of his wrote that we shouldn&#039;t say he died of an overdose. He died of heroin. To an addict, the death is a long series of events leading up to the time he dies. It&#039;s the drug that kills him, the long-term addiction that makes escape so damn near impossible, not one time that calling it an overdose makes it seem like he just accidentally took too much.  There was nothing accidental about it.

I think we need the same or something similar with mental illness.  Whether it&#039;s Robin Williams of one of thousands of others, the events that lead up to the actual death are just as important as the final choice to end it.  It&#039;s not a snap judgment or a mistake.  It&#039;s the result of a long fight with a fatal illness, and we need to start seeing it that way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate your views on this and I think you&#039;re right on, for the most part. One thing I take issue with is the seemingly incompatible statements that mental health should not be a stigma re: marriage and that many people with mental health diseases will never be cured.

I do believe that it&#039;s possible to have a successful marriage while suffering from depression, but I don&#039;t blame anyone for not wanting to risk that. I&#039;m not sure if you understand what it&#039;s like to be married to someone who&#039;s fighting depression. The fear that your wife will hurt herself, or worse. The fear that you&#039;re the cause of her depression, no matter how illogical that may be. The constant debilitating fear of what you&#039;ll come home to after a day at work. 

It&#039;s hard and scary as hell. It doesn&#039;t make you love your wife any less although there are times that you just don&#039;t know how to feel. I can learn to be ok and live with it, I hope, but I could never blame anyone for avoiding this.

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm. Let me back up here. I guess all I&#039;m saying is that I&#039;m unsure if Robin Williams should become the &quot;poster child&quot; of depression and/or suicide. Rarely are things so black and white. In fact, a lot of the public reaction to his death is surprising. People speak of him as if they personally knew him. Even if you enjoyed his work...ultimately you didn&#039;t KNOW him. And if you wanted to. It&#039;s too late now. Focus on those living around you. Depressed, not depressed, poor, rich, etc. Why does something need a label or be an extreme before attention is brought to it (as I look at this growing cyst on my wrist that my doctor won&#039;t treat....)?


To say that he was depressed....that is why he is dead...I just think it&#039;s premature. That could very well be. But we really don&#039;t know. Mr. Williams was supposedly clean from alcohol for years. He could have just had a bad binge. I have a lot of addicts as friends and family (to drugs and alcohol). They aren&#039;t depressed. They just have a physical pre-disposition to addiction. I myself...I&#039;ve never been diagnosed by a health professional, but I have no issues with depression and/or addiction. In spite of using drugs a lot in the past, and having people always ask me if there is something wrong with me...why am I so sad, etc. They &quot;assume&quot; that there is something wrong; when the reality is that I&#039;m just not relating to or interacting with them. (Little do they know, outward emotion is not reflective of the true feelings of someone who is clinically depressed anyway).


You were right about depression being a medical/physical problem. It involves brain chemistry. And it&#039;s complicated. Full disclosure of Mr. Williams&#039; issues may not even be possible due to HIPPA laws. I feel for his family. While depression needs to be addressed (and it seems like he was addressing it), it does not need to be tragic. Fame on the other hand...is often tragic. Most likely due to the alienation or straight addiction issues. But not everything needs an explanation or a label. We miss the forest for the trees that way.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hmmm. Let me back up here. I guess all I&#8217;m saying is that I&#8217;m unsure if Robin Williams should become the &#8220;poster child&#8221; of depression and/or suicide. Rarely are things so black and white. In fact, a lot of the public reaction to his death is surprising. People speak of him as if they personally knew him. Even if you enjoyed his work&#8230;ultimately you didn&#8217;t KNOW him. And if you wanted to. It&#8217;s too late now. Focus on those living around you. Depressed, not depressed, poor, rich, etc. Why does something need a label or be an extreme before attention is brought to it (as I look at this growing cyst on my wrist that my doctor won&#8217;t treat&#8230;.)?</p>
<p>To say that he was depressed&#8230;.that is why he is dead&#8230;I just think it&#8217;s premature. That could very well be. But we really don&#8217;t know. Mr. Williams was supposedly clean from alcohol for years. He could have just had a bad binge. I have a lot of addicts as friends and family (to drugs and alcohol). They aren&#8217;t depressed. They just have a physical pre-disposition to addiction. I myself&#8230;I&#8217;ve never been diagnosed by a health professional, but I have no issues with depression and/or addiction. In spite of using drugs a lot in the past, and having people always ask me if there is something wrong with me&#8230;why am I so sad, etc. They &#8220;assume&#8221; that there is something wrong; when the reality is that I&#8217;m just not relating to or interacting with them. (Little do they know, outward emotion is not reflective of the true feelings of someone who is clinically depressed anyway).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[You mean the response from his publicist? http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/11/showbiz/robin-williams-dead/index.html . I meant a response from a medical professional. No autopsy has been completed, and most likely won&#039;t be for weeks. Like most famous people who die in these circumstances, there is very good chance that we will never, ever know the real story. Nor should we spend too much time trying to discover it. Focus on the living. There&#039;s no bringing Robin Williams back at this point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great piece. However there has been no official statement in regards to the situation surrounding Robin Williams&#039; death. From my perspective, it&#039;s just the media running wild with talking (in regards to the depression and the suicide). Let&#039;s just keep that in mind. Whether or not he was actually clinically depressed or not is of lesser concern than how we react to those who need help in our society -- Jews or non-Jews. Too often we like to be happy; we like to push our problems aside and/or minimize them; we like to think that as God-fearing people, our lives are perfect and we have perfect kids, neighbors, etc. Oh, and of course, money does not answer all problems. Hopefully, we can glean this at least from his death.]]></description>
