*Accept the service/prayer (and post-churban includes restoring the Temple service)
*Prayer for peace]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you enjoyed, thanks for listening!

And great points, as always.

The first 3 and last 3 blessings of every amida are not requests. They frame the tefila putting us in the right mood for our &quot;requests&quot; - which we said in the class are not &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; requests anyway.

Similarly, the Shabbos and Yom Tov tefilos put us in the right frame of mind for the proper execution of Shabbos and Yom Tov mitzvos.

And yes, I believe the Sh&#039;A even says that we daven quietly to create intimacy with the divine. But there still needs to be meaning behind the conversation that creates intimacy. In other words, it would be useless to jibber jabber emptiness in the hope of creating dialogue and intimacy with the divine...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great class as always
Is there another reason for prayer for non-bakasha/request amidahs (Shabbat, Yom Tov, every Musaf)? They make up more than 18%  of them

I was thinking
1) Perhaps the 2nd, 5th and 7th blessing on shabbat (and during the week) are requests and would fall in line with the themes  of the class
2) Other dimentions of prayer include:intimacy with the Divine (Yaakov- Vafiga) and dialogue with God (Yitzcak&#039;s Sicha)]]></description>
