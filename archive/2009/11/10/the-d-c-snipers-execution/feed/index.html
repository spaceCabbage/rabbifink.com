		<description><![CDATA[Maybe partly, because for a long time the sniper was still out there.  In Fort Hood they have the perpetrator.  I remember the sniper attacks -- supposedly there was a &quot;white van&quot; that was the sniper vehicle.  I think it turned out there was no white van.  But for several days, if you saw a white van even in a different part of the country, you looked twice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a difference in public reaction between when the Beltway Sniper opened fire and the Major in Fort Hood.  With the sniper nothing else was talked about for days. With the Major the media seem to be soft pedaling the whole incident.  I don&#039;t want to believe that it&#039;s because we&#039;ve been enured to random acts of shooting violence.  I also don&#039;t want to believe that being pc has trumped expressing outrage.]]></description>
