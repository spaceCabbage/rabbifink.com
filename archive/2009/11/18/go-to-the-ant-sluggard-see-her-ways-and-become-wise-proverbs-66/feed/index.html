I am currently studying the effects of social group size on information transfer and task allocation; I was not aware of the behavior you mentioned about ants rescuing each other.  As a pest control owner in Lancaster, PA, it is fascinating to learn that ants have instincts that are worth studying for a business model.

I will be posting some of these findings on my facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/DominionPestControl]]></description>
