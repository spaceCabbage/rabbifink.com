		<description><![CDATA[I am a big Mattisyahu fan and I have been a close follower of his career. He makes a tremendous Kiddush Hashem. His music leaves solid subliminal messages of G-dliness and the themes can help make the world a better place. How fitting for NBC to use it to promote the Olympics which should foster World Peace through sport. If you have been on his website he even has a video clip about going to the Mikva daily! No actual skinny dipping footage - but being out there with payos and tzitzis singing a subtle message of spirituality is a good thing. His One day song is excellent and the music video is even Kosher to watch!]]></description>
