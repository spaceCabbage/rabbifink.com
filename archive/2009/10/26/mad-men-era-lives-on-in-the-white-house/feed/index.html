		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re not understanding my point.

A regular pick-up game is NOT silly.

It&#039;s an opportunity to build stronger relationships with coworkers and your boss (the president). It&#039;s also an opportunity to have someone&#039;s ear and discuss things in a low-key setting.

Things come up at these games. Everyone shoots around to warm up. You chat about stuff. Usually, it&#039;s casual (how are the kids doing?) or goofy trashtalking. That stuff MATTERS. It&#039;s the glue that holds social relationships together. You build common ground. You gain familiarity and trust. Also, sometimes work stuff comes up out of nowhere, and you wind up having a conversation that actually has some effect.

Obama deserves credit for the general inclusiveness of his administration, but that does not entitle him to a pass for failing to recognize one of the most subtle ways in which women are excluded in the current workplace. It&#039;s about socialization and the access and opportunity that these kinds of &quot;games&quot; offer.

I may not agree with the approach NOW has taken, and I wouldn&#039;t necessarily agree that this is a high priority concern compared to others, but it is very real. I wonder if maybe you&#039;ve never participated in these kinds of events in a workplace setting to see the access it gives you to people you wouldn&#039;t otherwise get a chance to talk to, whether it&#039;s through company softball or pick-up basketball games with colleagues, or golf outings (a popular place for deals to be made), which is why you think it&#039;s just a silly game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excuse me. I am not trivializing the barriers women face in the workplace. NOW is doing that.

They are using a silly basketball game to try and illustrate a real issue. That is trivializing the real issue.

Instead of crediting Obama with giving women great opportunities in his administration, NOW focuses on a non-issue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is not NBA level basketball. This is a rec level pick-up game. There is no reason women should NOT have been invited.

When people talk about glass ceiling and exclusive behavior that exists today, it&#039;s not about refusal to hire. It&#039;s about being able to participate in the social networking activities that allow for career growth. This includes golfing and pick-up basketball.

Does that mean that most or even more than a few people would be interested? Probably not. When I organized regular faculty-student pick-up games, I always made it clear that women were welcome and invited to play. But to be honest, the reality is that once we had a solid group coming that already had some level of experience or skill on the court, we had a hard time getting more than one or two other women or older faculty members of either gender to want to run with us. And I&#039;ve always been a bit concerned that my overuse of sports references and analogies is exclusionary of non-sports fan, a group that is disproportionately female.

Is NOW over-reacting? There are more important things to worry about. However, you&#039;re trivializing a completely legitimate complaint about the barriers that women face in the workplace.]]></description>
