		<description><![CDATA[“When the smart guys started this business of securitizing things that didn’t even exist in the first place, who was running the firms they worked for? Our guys! The lower third of the class! Guys who didn’t have the foggiest notion of what a credit default swap was. All our guys knew was that they were getting disgustingly rich, and they had gotten to like that. All of that easy money had eaten away at their sense of enoughness.”

The problem would seem to be not that there were smart people handling the money, rather that there weren&#039;t smart people handling the money!  If the people running the firms knew what the people doing with the money were doing, there would have been no problem, according to this article.  The problem wasn&#039;t smart or not smart, the problem was responsibility.  The people who handled the money (the traders) weren&#039;t responsible for the outcome.  If they had known that they could be fired if they misused the money, then they wouldn&#039;t have done it.  If there is no responsibility, there won&#039;t be any encouragement to do good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your theories are lovely, but wrong. The proof is in the pudding. Being &quot;Too Smart&quot; cost is trillions of dollars. Over leveraging and credit default swaps are not things that non-MIT grads think about or can implement.

The economy is recovering now because these &quot;too smart&quot; ideas are now seen as dangerous and harmful. That is the point. Being &quot;too smart&quot; HURT us. Yes it is counterintuitive, but it is plain as day to see that is what happened.

Read the link in the NY Times. Then come back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The fact is, even though business and finance don&#039;t &#039;produce&#039; anything, the smarter the people you have in business and finance, the more efficiently the available money will be spent.  The more efficiently money is spent, the more money (resources) you have to spend.  Additionally, the more money is spent on things that will produce, as  opposed to things that won&#039;t produce, the more stuff is produced. so things are produced, just not directly.  But then, what in the modern economy IS produced directly?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree with you, Rabbi Fink.  Wall Street traders are necessary and in fact do produce - they enable investment.  Most people don&#039;t have time to spend figuring out the best investments.  So they turn to surrogates.  The problem is that it was artificially easy to engage in high risk investments, due to government meddling, and additionally,  they knew that the government would bail them out when the investments went sour.  Just because they don&#039;t &quot;produce&quot; physical objects doesn&#039;t mean that they aren&#039;t productive.  Is being a Rabbi not productive, even though you don&#039;t physically produce things?
Lawyers are also necessary, both in court and out of court.  People can&#039;t spend all their time studying the legal system, so they hire surrogates. This helps societies function, which I believe to be very admirable.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I disagree with you, Rabbi Fink.  Wall Street traders are necessary and in fact do produce &#8211; they enable investment.  Most people don&#8217;t have time to spend figuring out the best investments.  So they turn to surrogates.
