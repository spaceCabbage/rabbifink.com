		<description><![CDATA[My son, SPC Daniel Agami was killed in Iraq on 06/21/07 and the last request he made before his redeployment to Iraq in April of 2007, was that he be buried in a Jewish Cemetary.  We have been to numerous dedications in Arlington, and you will see a sprinkle of Star of David headstones.  They stand out, and when we visit, we seek them out and put a stone on top of them, even those from the earliest wars.  Our son, will long be remembered as &quot;GI Jew&quot; and The Hebrew Hammer that he proudly bore on his rifle while on duty in Iraq.  Check out www.JewsinGreen.com and you will see the number of Jewish soldiers recently killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.  While we pray every Shabbos for our Israeli soldiers, we should be equally as dedicated in praying for our American Jewish Soldiers that are overseas dying by the hands of the same terrorist Arabs.  No difference.  I wish every Shul in America would understand this, in particular the Orthodox, Chabad, etc.
Just google, Daniel Agami.  He was amazing and will be forever remembered by his family and friends for generations to come.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to wonder if maybe he (Scalia) was annoyed that someone was &quot;baiting&quot; him into making a declaration of a sort that would anger millions of Christians, and that this was the only way (being argumentative) he could think of getting out of that predicament?

In any case, what he said was foolish and he should apologize and clarify.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;It shows you that you can&#039;t just take anything out of its context and redefine it.&lt;/em&gt;

Are you serious?

It used to be argued that this country was Christian. You can read legal opinions where the issue is raised and decided as a matter of law that the country was Christian. However, this is no longer the case. The USA is not a Christian country AS A MATTER OF LAW and Christian symbols are not representative of the &quot;country&quot;.

That&#039;s not redefining things out of their context, that is the law.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[sometimes things can be very simple and basic. yet a lawmaker like Scalia isn&#039;t interested in the simplicity of the matter, but in the exact definition and determination. If there is nothing that legally defines it as christian, Scalia sees no reason it cannot represent Jews and Muslims as well, because he is only looking ta it from its legal aspects.
