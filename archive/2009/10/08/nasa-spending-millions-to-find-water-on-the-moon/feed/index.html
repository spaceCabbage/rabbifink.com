		<description><![CDATA[Nate, Isaac:

You are only right as that is the way it is. And you are only partially correct.

For example, Directv launches their own satellites into orbit, not NASA&#039;s. If the private sector wanted or needed GPS and other benefits that NASA provides we would get them through the private sector.

Plus, there is a huge difference between space exploration and development of technology using space. Maybe I do want satellites in orbit, but I certainly could not care less if there are life forms on other planets...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was the sticker shock of seeing NASA&#039;s yearly budget combined with the question of whether this is the best way to allocate those tremendous resources.

Maybe these programs should be on hold while the economy struggles to revive itself...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is a bargain at twice the price. In terms of space exploration, 79 million is couch-cushion money. With NASA planning to return to the moon, this is a necessary first step to observe Lunar geography/composition.

We know that there is water on the Moon(somewhere). We also know that there are components of water in the lunar soil. The question is then, how much water is there? It is thought that the permanently dark craters (such as those in the polar regions), could contain water in the form of ice. By impacting with the crater, hopefully we will learn more about the composition of soil in these craters which will hopefully  include a concentration of ice which will be a needed for a human development/ presence on the Moon.]]></description>
