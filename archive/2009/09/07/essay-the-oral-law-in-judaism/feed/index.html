		<description><![CDATA[i am a Muslim and since belief in Torah is as essential as belief in Quran and since Quran speak of Torah alot and the most mentioned person in Quran too is Moses, it compelled me to search for Torah scrolls, i believe i have developed a new and more logical view regarding Torah code and i can relate to it as a literal inscription on r18ht hands as a link between cha(* and Total ecl(*pse and Am(*dah where all have unique number, to me this 18 corresponds to the golden rat(*o 1618 where 18 serves as the golden number making a rat(*o golden, r18ht hand physics serves as Torah law for my in in context of rule oif r18ht hand law followed by Universal electro magnetics unanimously, i do not find a left hand present any where to assist the r18ht hand in UNiversal law of both physics as well as mathematics, because i do not find a r18ht hand that does not read 18 where 1 serves as tenth of the unit 8. I noticed 8 is an /8rk in math of all religions, and thus i also found that basic number for all religions in prayers as well as for their respective scriptures all unanimously are bind to number 18. for example, 18 Amidah of Torah, 18 benedicitons of Gospel, 18 Sura Kahaf of Quran, 18 Hindu Puranas, 18 positions of Buddha, 18 basic principles of Martial Arts, Tai chi, all have this blue print of r18ht hand, i further notice the Prophecy of JOB 40:14 stressing on fact that salvation is in our own r18ht hands, leading to a conclusive connection to redemption and salvation through this hand and number some how, further study links Genesis of Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy and Numbers to a very unique number 16:18 in context of  Beit Hamikdash, Mannah ha Omer and the Torah law again to golden ratio 1618, the new testament too points to same code as rock of salvation/church in Gospel of Mathew 16:18 pointing to Third temple which indeed comes out to be location for the first temple built by Prophet Abraham at 1618 point of the Earth. I literally take this 1/8 in my r18ht hand palm to be the two scrolls of Torah and its law, the base and foundation for all creation because Quran speak of numbers, unique numbers that bind all creation in one book without missing a single creation. I notice all clestial bodies spin at the spin of r18ht hand only, same for all blooming flowers, snail shells, water taps, coke pepsi bottle caps, jar tops, all things visibly display rule of r18ht hand law to be the only law in effect leading to my personal understanding of A1L@W of T@RAH to be from A1L@H of Qur@n and A1G@D of G@spel, a perfect Deuteronomy of 18:18, especially when it comes to each and every total eclipse or the law that governs all eclipses, a law based on repetition of 18:18 years! Shema (*srael and Shemoneh Esre(* both represent a direct link to not only the r18ht hand whoch is placed above left or even on the eyes while reciting shama but also the very number 18 too, which indeed is an inscription of r18ht hand. To me this is materializing of Haggai 2 about des(*re/Am(*dah of all nat(*ons, and since desire of any nations naturally comes to be to worship their Creator through praise, i noticed thus that 18 is the divinely prescribed number for praise/amidah/bendiction/hamd and serves as a covenant too, where 8 is an /8rk of the covenant, on the very hand of covenant, the very code we all been looking for i guess, this is  my personal research based on extensive 18 years study and meditation on Torah law in light of Quran and teaching of Prophet Muhammad about r18ht hand and its holiness! Even the winds change per Torah law as i have not seen a single Tornado, Typhoon hurricane or twister in NOrthern hemisphere where rule of r18ht hand law was not in action. Read in Isiah how alm18hty creator created and measured heaven and earth with the palm of h1s r18ht hand, i think that measurement serves as the code and thus 18 comes up again when we read the b8k of r18ht hands, left hand b8k is the oppsite of r18ht hand b8k reading  81 instead of 18 and spinning clockwise or anti r18ht hand spin too. i can go on and on and on as i have been for years and i have come to another conclusion, each creation is a blessing and if we come to count all blessings we cannot comprehend their count yet we find all creation less or more still to be measure perfectly to the ratio of r18ht hand palm not only digitally but also spiritually and physically being one and only law in effect, no UNlaw to be found that can VETO the rule of A1Law, last but not least, end times is i notice called &#039;Aharit ha Yameem&#039; in Juda(*sm, Ahirat means end times and Yameen means r18ht hand, Islam speaks of a book of r18ht hand to come forth in end times as final Judgement, believers that day will rejoice and disbelievers in book of r18ht hand will suffer due to their denial. I take us to be the sheep and since Torah is a living book according to Quran, its inscription on the very r18ht hand palm skin as two scrolls of maths being 18 confirms with the jewish tradition of Torah being inscribed on a sheep skin parchment or something of that sort, apart from the fact that 18 is fulfillment of Torah and number of will(ratzon), appears on each r18ht hand, not a scrolls has jumped its place on either hand where r18ht hand for any would place 1 as a unit instead of it being a tenth for the very book of 10 commandments, we should all know the link between 0 of 10 commandments and the 8 of 18 Amidah in maths, 2 zeros make one 8, creation is an egg(zero) that comes to being out of 2 zeros, and when it divides or multiplies it becomes more zeros, each spinning the spin of r18ht hand law, just like cytoplasm in each and every heart, r18ht hand spin is unanimously unchallenged inside out this universe, i find us all to be mere carving on the palm of our creator, i find the universe to be in the palm of our creator, r18ht hand palm! Any comments? i&#039;ll be waiting anxiously. For i have found a L18ht that shines endlessly emitting from the very r18ht hand box of covenant to all corners of Sumara Judea and far corners of the world, Again highlighting Haggai 2:7-9 as a great Prophecy Prophecising coming of the Last Prophet of Deuteronomy 18:18, Prophet Muhamnmad, because it is the word(Quran) revealed to him which lead me to this Torah of mine and all the links, simply speaking, Quran is Torah written on hearts while Torah of Moses is an inscription of the r18ht hand but in Math and to keep it in mind, 18 Amidah were established with custom involving the very hand that contains the sricpture(18) perhaps waiting for some time in future when it could be explained more properly, i find it to be no other time than ours! I just cant find a single snail shell that is not designed per the rule of r18ht hand draw, or design of r18ht hand thumb around the index finger. i share this with hope for peace through understanding using common science signs and sense involving rule of r18ht hand law and ratio of r18ht hand palm as golden ratio 1618 serving as Torah code/inscription/scrolls. am thrilled indeed by this finding that boosts my spirits and belief in Quran is further strengthened as being a word that explains all scriptures prior to its revelation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Another metaphor would be a blueprint.&lt;/i&gt;

never much cared for this metaphor though it&#039;s been repeated ad infinitum by scores of  baalei mussar.  The Torah is first and formost a book or a tree.  So the Cosmos creatyed from it is either the staging of a play from the book (of course props are needed!) and/or an orchard that grew and continues to grow from the primal tree.

&lt;i&gt;Or God looked at the sale of Joseph and created the word? Impossible&lt;/i&gt;

OTC quite possible.  remember that &quot;alma&quot; and its LQ cognate &quot;olam&quot; connote both space AND time.  History unspools the way that it does because it is is going according to the &quot;script/screenplay&quot; fore-ordained by the Torah

&lt;i&gt;a talented architect could possibly rewrite a blueprint by examining a building&lt;/i&gt;

By rewrite do you mean to alter and change or to recreate?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You wrote &quot; As time progresses Moses added (probably divinely inspired) notes to the end of the TSBK to complete the books. &quot;

When you say probably divinely inspired, does this mean that you are not certain whether the book of devarim was written with divine inspiration?
