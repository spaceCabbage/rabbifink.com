		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve come to this site a little late but felt compelled to give a post.
The statement &quot;there&#039;s probably no god&quot; is completely accurate and based clearly on much more research than you have done. Given that over the centuries there have been hundreds of gods that you choose not to believe in anymore, and that even today there are a few dozen. It is entirely accurate to say that their all probably wrong.

It is much more likely that humans fill a need for answers about life and death and social order with religion than a higher power controls the universe.

Before you jump down my throat about not knowing what im talking about.
I have read the Bible, and the Koran, and the Tanakh and researched many Sutras in Buddhism (my preferred text).
I have also read and researched the Theory of evolution and scientific methodology.
I suggest you do the same, because it really becomes quite clear how the world works once you take a passion in scientific thinking. It allows room for the unknown and challenges you to find the answer. Religion claims to have the answer and fills unknown&#039;s with &quot;having faith&quot;

The reason he says &quot;probably&quot; is because like any good scientist or atheist should argue, it is impossible to prove a negative, proving something does exist is much easier because we can observe it and test it, proving something wont happen or doesn&#039;t exist is by definition impossible because you cant observe it or test it. Therefore you must always leave open the possibility that you are wrong. Hence &quot;probably&quot;. Regardless of how improbable the possibility.

The &quot;don&#039;t worry statement&quot; comes from the bibles own flawed logic. If you believe in God then you must by definition believe in hell as well. And lets be honest spending eternity burning would worry most people. What he&#039;s saying in that statement is that you should enjoy your life without the worry of eternal damnation because ultimately religion and God all a load of nonsense. Provocative? - Yes - A good way to convince believers to let religion go? - No, probably not!

People really need to relearn what science is and how it works. It is a fundimental way of explaining the world around us accuratly and without emotion. If you doubt that then i suggest you count the things that science has contributed too that are in your room that you are sitting in right now. Starting with your computer.]]></description>
