		<description><![CDATA[Exactly!

By blaming it on the Jets and &quot;out of respect for the Jewish faith&quot; they pass the buck to innocent parties.

Time for a new PR firm...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s most egregious is that this is about staging logistics. This is not a double-booking or any similar conflict.

U2 decided what they wanted their stage and set-up to be at the arena, and they have selected something so complicated on a Friday night that it can not be dismantled in time for a Sunday afternoon football game (query whether the extra 3 hours mattered that much, given the entire day of SATURDAY in between).

Somehow, the technology exists to switch an arena from a hockey game to a basketball game within the SAME DAY (the Staples Center has done it within 3 hours!). But the staging for a U2 concert requires &quot;up to 2 days???&quot; Even though the INITIAL schedule wasn&#039;t a complete 48 hours anyway???

You&#039;d think U2 would want to figure out if their fans would prefer a Friday night show that has already been announced (and planned for) versus an extra pyrotechnic display on a switched midweek night in the first place here. Nothing about &quot;blame the Jets&quot; or &quot;blame the Jews&quot; adds up in this equation. For all we know, they realized well after the fact that the staging logistics would be a headache, and then chose to use the game time switch as the excuse to prompt the change, rather than scaling back the set-up to make it work, hoping the fans would love them enough not to see this for the BS that it is.]]></description>
