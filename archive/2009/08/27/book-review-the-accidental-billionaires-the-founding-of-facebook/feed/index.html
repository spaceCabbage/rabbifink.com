		<description><![CDATA[Hey,

Thanks for checking out the blog.

His portrayal of the founders is from the perspective of the business guy partner who (allegedly) got &quot;screwed over&quot; by Zuckerberg (the actual founder), so yes, do take it all with a small grain of salt.

As far as shenanigans, if you mean &quot;hooking up&quot;, then there are a couple of mentions of some sexual activity, but nothing out of the ordinary for an american college student, let alone a Harvard campus celebrity.

In any case, the lessons of the book are not interrelated with the two issues you raise.]]></description>

Had heard about this book.  Wasn&#039;t there something controversial about how it portrayed the creators?  I remember hearing something about dorm room shenanigans and untoward stuff.]]></description>
