		<description><![CDATA[I am also an Orthodox Jewish black woman and I find Rivka&#039;s judgement very poor.  In the three instances that I have had unobservant roommates, I considered the kitchen entirely treif or we partitioned the kitchen into kosher and treif.  You can reasonably assume that someone else is not going to keep your level of kashrut, so if you have kosher items you invested in, you wrap them up and put them in storage.  Everything else is kasherable, so I don&#039;t understand her mentality in the first place.

Even so, this was a forgiveable lapse that could be attributed to naivete.  But the way in which she handled the police is unfathomable.  If the police were in my home my first priority would be to explain the misunderstanding, come to a resolution and avoid anymore conflict.  I am not a lawyer but I have seen enough court shows to know that you can&#039;t evict someone with a lease and that an apology will work wonders with the police.

I don&#039;t understand how the need to pray in a middle of a conversation or to lock yourself in a room (outside the threat of physical danger) has anything to do with piety or Orthodox Judaism.  It was a nutty thing to do that would obviously aggravate the police.

Rivka made a mistake and compounded it with poor reasoning, albeit under a stressful situation.  I don&#039;t think that religion or race will be much of a factor given the behavior described.  Yes, people are prejudiced against both, but she gave them an open excuse to act on it by being not so smart.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree that her moving her room mate&#039;s things out is very odd - I would have simply moved everything outside of the apartment or had called someone myself who would help me handle the case.

What I think is odd is that the police would find her religious beliefs and practices &quot;bizarre&quot; (not saying that Tzvi Haber is speaking for them, of course). I come from a small town in PA with an almost non-existant jewish community, where it would be expected that kosher practices would seem weird, but in NYC? That is unreal. I would think they&#039;d have more tolerance since they&#039;d be used to such a variety of cultures and religions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It would seem that although she appears to be innocent, it would be highly irregular for her to move Brooke&#039;s stuff out herself, an for her to pay for a hotel room for Brooke. It seems it would be an eviction, and evictions are usually carried out by the Sheriff etc.
Of course if that was her agreement then it would be fine, it is just unusual.
Insofar as the comparison to the Gates incident; I would surmise that in the Rivka incident the prejudice was effected by her seemingly bizarre kosher and prayer requests than her skin color.]]></description>
