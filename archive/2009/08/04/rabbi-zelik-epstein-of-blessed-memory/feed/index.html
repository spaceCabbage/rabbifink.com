		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Perhaps even more significantly, he was above the fray. He did not get involved in politics and instead, studied, taught and advised and preached Torah and its values.&quot;

I don&#039;t want to judge R&#039; Zelik; there is certainly a place for people who just teach, but I don&#039;t think that non involvement in politics, especially Israeli politics (which is the responsibility of every Jew) is praiseworthy.  Torah should not be just limited to the Beit Midrash and personal life but also to our national life and the world.  We should learn what the Torah says about everything from how to run an economy, how to treat the environment, whether to go to war or not, everything!  Rabbis should teach what Torah has to say not just about the individual Jew, but also the Jewish nation, and even the rest of the world.]]></description>
