		<description><![CDATA[Chaim is right: a large portion of our tax dollars goes to a public school system that is not utilized by our children. Either we get that back or, in the presence of a substancial Jewish demand(a) the system pays for the secular studies (which we have already paid with our taxes)(b) we pay for our daily kodesh within the premises.
Seen this done in Canada.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Charity begins at home, so does home schooling. The mean jewish high school tuition of 22,000 a school year is prohibitive.No tax benefit is granted and yet a portion of our tax dollars goes to a public school system that is not utilised by children in Yeshivot.A family with three children in the teen years looking for schooling cannot sustain such potential debt. Add the incremental school building funds,books,Israel school trips,summer camps and declining job market the spiral gets devastating.
An Arab president will never understand.
Jewish, Yeshiva, Tutors after school,intergrated by and with local shuls to complement public school with attempts at synthesizing with local public schools in a magnet program would be more economical although neither immediate nor adminstratetively easy but could ease the sunami thats coming.Cutting tuition down such as done in the Catholic day schools is also a realistic response; our childrens education goals have to be matched with resources to be sustainable.]]></description>
