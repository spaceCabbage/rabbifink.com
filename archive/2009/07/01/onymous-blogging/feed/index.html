		<description><![CDATA[I tweet facebook and blog using my real name. I&#039;ve always felt that if I have something to say that I&#039;m embarrassed or scared to have attributed to myself, I probably shouldn&#039;t be saying it. I find that anonymous bloggers are much more aggressive than they probably really are - or would be if they would be onymous. (ff spellcheck is not up to date on that word).
I do see why DovBear and the ilk are anonymous though. As he says, why should his kids suffer because he is an outspoken blogger. His words would carry a lot more weight if he had a name, as would the Bray, not brisk yeshivish and all the others who comment on the chareidi world.
all the best]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I blog and FB and tweet under my own name. I am proud of who I am, and i am not afraid to have opinions. i am careful to tread the line between public and private, and am always respectful of my family&#039;s feelings with regard to putting information out there.

hiding behind anonymity - where is the courage of one&#039;s convictions? yes it allows people, esp in the religious community, to vent and blog without risk of recriminations - but what about being true to yourself?

i have made some amazing friends on these social networks, - even the anonymous ones end up having a name and a face...you can only be anonymous to a point.

being that i am a mom, i am very careful that my blogging isn&#039;t something that will embarrass the children. My husband and my sons are very proud of me and the blog, and i know that i can ruin that by one unthought-out post. if i was anonymous, it would be no big deal.

i raise my children to be true to themselves, how can i teach them that if i do not practise it?]]></description>
