		<description><![CDATA[It is fascinating to see biological connections between unlikely groups.  Years ago I was a bone marrow match for a woman in Spain which means we had a common ancestor although she was not Jewish and I don&#039;t do flamenco or chow on paella.  On a more serious note, it is irksome when Jewish links to the Castros, Al Qaeda creeps and sometimes (incorrectly!!!) to gmach shmo himself are made.  It&#039;s as though we have some responsibility for the evil they wreak.  Your idea that we are all part of one big human family is a nice idea in concept but there are just too many people out there whose actions and ideas are not exactly in synch with Torah values.]]></description>
