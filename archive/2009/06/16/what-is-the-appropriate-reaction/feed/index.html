		<description><![CDATA[ul tikri halichot ella halachot.
Without recognizing the immutable laws of nature, of social psychology that reflects who we are we set up unrealistic moral expectation. Our nature is to protect our closest, our children and extended families first. Morals are the highest expression of our feelings that are feelings, reflect physiologicaly and bias what we think is logical judgement.

Discussion of what we call morality without the honesty of our inborn tendencies, or how we are hard wired leads to a dishonest morality outside of humanity separated from human experience.

Of course this is a tragedy for every party involved; if it was Palestinian children or Israeli children that died of an equal tragedy would ones gradation of emotional distress be any different? Who is honest enough to recognise the difference between an idealised morality and every day reality, our humanity is also a moral imperative.

Family,biologicalconnection,prejudice choices despite this fact we all share our humanity and feel pain at death of innocents.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi -

Sounds like the apocryphal story of the Rav who went on self imposed Golus (exile). Upon his return to town, he heard one of the townspeople saying &quot;Yankel is very sick.&quot; Thinking it was &quot;his&quot; Yankel, he gasped. Upon finding out that it was another Yankel, he momentarily breathed a sigh of relief. He then chastised himself for feeling relief that it was another Yankel that was sick... and promptly turned around and went back to exile without even stopping off at home, saying &quot;I  guess I&#039;m not ready....&quot;

Frankly, while its a nice story, I always took it with a grain of salt....

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Offwinger.  We would automatically feel compassion for the child Jacob who fell to his death, but could feel it more when we heard he was from a Chassidic community.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;He thinks we should react equally to all tragedy.&lt;/i&gt;

That&#039;s doesn&#039;t accurately represent exactly what he (Offwinger) said above.

What he said was that it is morally unacceptable (i.e. &quot;crosses the line&quot;) to NOT be shocked and outraged at the death of non-Jewish children.  And I agree with this.

In your example of 2 caring and sensitive people, they were saddened and empathetic (&quot;When I told the story over, both people had serious looks on their faces and clearly empathized with the poor child.&quot;). Then later when you told them that these were Jewish children, they become even more saddened and empathetic (&quot;Their jaws dropped and they exclaimed Oy! That’s terrible!&quot;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark, you are right that your hierarchy is true in reality but is this morally appropriate?

In other words, what should our reaction be?

See what Offwinger wrote? He thinks (- this is mere conjecture as I put words in his mouth) you are morally reprehensible for making your nice looking list. He thinks we should react equally to all tragedy.

This is the question. This is where the moral tension lies. Is it okay to use your list or is it wrong?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[E. Fink, what kind of question is this? It is basic human nature, not Jewish nature, or anything else, only basic human nature that people care less and less as the circle of acquaintance (there&#039;s a psychological term for this that I can&#039;t recall at the moment) from themselves widens.

Basically caring goes from higher to lower [very] roughly as follows:

* Yourself
* Your children
* Your spouse
(the above 3 are often at the same level, perhaps with children at the top)
* Your extended family
* Your somewhat wider extended family
* Your friends
* Your neighbors/associates that you depend on (or that depend on you)
* Your other neighbors
* Your acquaintances
* Your tribe
* Your nation
* Members of other nations you have some affinity to
* Members of other nations you have alliances with
* Members of other nations you have common purpose with
* The rest of the world

And this goes for &lt;b&gt;everyone&lt;/b&gt; in the world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not &quot;more&quot; shocked and upset to know that these were Jewish boys. The appropriate reaction is to be sad about the tragedy, no matter who the children were.

It is only inevitable, though, that people react more when they feel &quot;closer&quot; to the tragedy. If you knew the boys or know people who knew them, you react more strongly too.

The fact that they are Jewish boys doesn&#039;t make me feel MORE connected to them, but if they were boys that I knew or whose families I knew, it would be different.

Let me ask a different question: Do you play Jewish geography? Do you understand why people even do?

I think it&#039;s silly, to be honest. You establish you know people in common. Big deal. But Jews are obsessed with figuring out who they know in common &#038; using that as a connection to other people. I&#039;m sure other groups have their own equivalent.

I don&#039;t think there is a right or wrong in this. We&#039;re biologically wired to care more about ourselves &#038; our kin than strangers. Personally, the concept of areivut does not mean that I need to feel worse because these were Jewish boys, but I don&#039;t fault someone else who does. I think it only crosses the line when people are NOT shocked and outraged at the death of non-Jewish children!

Our heuristics on these things will never be perfectly rational. We&#039;re also more &quot;outraged&quot; or horrified when a death seems like a greater tragedy, because we can&#039;t make sense of it. People are in car accidents all the time, but not elevator ones. Adults die often, not childen. It disrupts our general sense of the world; thus, it is more shocking and upsetting.]]></description>
