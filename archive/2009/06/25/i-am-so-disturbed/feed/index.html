		<description><![CDATA[BTS has good company:

Unfortunate, but true. I have run into this kind of behavior-and had it directed at me. People agressively critize, or are suprisingly rude, or behave badly and are religious/observant, also sometimes make a point of reminding me that they are as if it is a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot;.

It starts to feel like some religious/observant people feel that people who are not religious/observant are also not really people.

I think it is an important dialogue to open. Thanks for that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, we should always be aware and be careful.  We need to go back and re-learn what Pirkei Avos and Messilas Yesharim says about  working on having good middos.

I also agree that sometimes people just notice the negative behaviors from others and not the positive things like the chesed some do.

In general though, we should work on ourselves continuously, and by doing so we&#039;ll make a kiddush Hashem]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thank you for your comment.

The only Lashon Hara here is regarding those who treat Binyamin like dirt. I said he is not &quot;know as the most cordial guy&quot; and that is due to the reputation that &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; give him. As is clear from my experience, merely talking to him like a human being opened up a completely different person and I happen to think he is a special guy and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;will be using him again without question&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t saying not to be nice to him, that was where I wholeheartedly agree with you. And I come across this sort of thing all the time living &quot;in-town&quot; and hate it passionately. Aren&#039;t I glad I&#039;m moving to LA :) My point was in terms of BTS&#039;s credibility - he may have a negative and bitter outlook on everything and thus you can&#039;t take him at his word when he says people are rude.
The problem is a real one and I&#039;m glad you addressed it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Traffic rudeness is an important one to work on, especially cutting off busses which have many more people on them than your car. Teaching my son to drive really brought that one home to me, that traffic courtesy is safer and often actually faster, even if they can&#039;t see that you are a frum Jew.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all I completely disagree with you.

It is exactly those types of people that we tend to ignore, talk rudely towards, insult and disparage.

There is no excuse for not acting civilly, EVEN (especially maybe) in a potentially hostile situation.

Second, the post is misleading and I am changing it, he is not a jerk or thief. He is merely not the most personable guy. That is no reason to treat him like trash. Period.]]></description>
