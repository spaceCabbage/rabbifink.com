<p>We went back to something from last week. The commentaries ask a question on the Rambam&#8217;s opinion that one should not marry unless they have a job and a home. The problem is that the Rambam&#8217;s use of the verses to prove his point is out of order. Tune in for a very interesting discussion (including some Artscroll &#8220;censorship&#8221;). Then we began chapter 6 and learned one of the most famous statements of the Rambam. We then had another excellent discussion about a ridiculous statement that someone made about living west of the 405.</p>
<p>The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.</p>

We still were unable to finish Chapter 4 last week. We did finish it this today. The Rambam ends the chapter by proscribing a Torah scholar from living in a city without 10 things - including a doctor. Fascinating.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.

		<itunes:summary>The Rambam class continued today.

We continued laying the groundwork for the Rambam&#039;s methodology of character development. The basic idea is that wherever one has flaws one should do things that strengthen their character in those areas. We got through the first chapter and began chapter 2.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.

Today we started Chapter 5. The chapter is about Kiddush Hashem, sanctifying G-D&#039;s name and Chillul Hashem, desecrating G-D&#039;s name.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

We began the second chapter where the Rambam tells us about the obligation to love and the obligation to fear God. The Rambam&#039;s approach is different than what you may have learned and it is worthwhile to understand the approach of the Rambam on this issue.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.

<p>There are a few seminal events that are rare, exhilarating and emotional in the life of a Rabbi. One of those events is the dedication of a new Torah scroll. And yesterday I was fortunate to be a part of a wonderful Torah Dedication ceremony and celebration.</p>
<p><strong>Randy</strong> and <strong>Deeana Frankel</strong> are celebrating the Bnei Mitzvah of their son <strong>Zev</strong> and their daughter <strong>Ariella</strong>. They chose to commemorate this milestone by restoring a Torah scroll rescued from the Holocaust. During a small, intimate ceremony, that Torah scroll has been placed in the Ark at the Shul on the Beach and we could not be more proud.</p>
<p>The ceremony was the typical Torah dedication with one small exception. The standard procession took place on the Venice Boardwalk.<span id="more-3467"></span> Hundreds of people stopped to watch, photograph, record video and enjoy the celebration. It was clearly inspirational for many of the observers to see such excitement and honor given to the Torah. It was a real kiddush Hashem.</p>
<p>We danced on the boardwalk with the Torah for a little while then proceeded into the Shul where we placed the Torah in its new home in the Ark. Following the ceremony we enjoyed a lovely catered lunch. During the lunch Randy spoke for a few minutes. I also addressed the guests for a few minutes and you can hear both speeches by clicking the play button below.</p>
<p>This morning, we used the Torah for the first time as we read from the Torah as part of morning services. It was very powerful to call Randy to the Torah to make the blessing on the Torah using his very own Torah.</p>
<p>The event was very inspirational for me and something I will never forget. Not all rabbis are lucky enough to participate in a Torah dedication ceremony and I thank the Frankels for making me a lucky rabbi!</p>
<p>I had a few photos taken of the procession. The Frankels had a professional photographer who can certainly put these photos to shame but the celebration was so special and so unique that I wanted to share these photos with everyone.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Last week we talked about the Healthcare plan that was ratified by the house the night before.

This week we got back on track and started Chapter 9.

In my opinion, this was one of the best Mesillas Yesharim classes to date. The Ramchal was so insightful and I shared an insight of my own which I think is very poignant. It all goes back to Adam and Eve being ousted from the Garden of Eden.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prayer is something so basic to all faiths and religions. Jewish ideas of prayer are decidedly different from other cultures. It is very important to learn about the Jewish approach to prayer.</p>
<p>I began the class by announcing that this was a topic I longed to discuss for a very long time. I finally felt that the time was right.</p>
<p>We asked all the basic questions about prayer. We asked some advanced questions about prayer.</p>
<p>Using ideas from Rabbi Chaim Volozhin and others we pieced together a rational approach to prayer that made sense to us.</p>
<p>It was a very exciting class with outstanding participation and a very alert listening audience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a Holiday break, the Mesillas Yesharim class returned today. Today&#8217;s class was a bit shortened due to the extra long Rosh Chodesh prayers.</p>
<p>What was short on time was long on content. The end of the Seventh Chapter of Mesillas Yesharim contains what I find to be the most profound insight in the entire text.</p>
<p>We all are familiar with the common idea that if &#8220;one doesn&#8217;t feel &#8216;it&#8217;&#8221; we don&#8217;t feel comfortable acting that in way. We even call people who act in a way not consonant with their feelings hypocrites. The Ramchal has a completely different perspective and I strongly recommend listening to today&#8217;s class.</p>

<p>We began with a great discussion about Truth. We talked about how people fall into two categories.

We began with a great discussion about Truth. We talked about how people fall into two categories.

Another point of emphasis was the understanding that our natural state as humans is to be stationary. We are naturally lazy. Our task is to rise up from that laziness and elevate our lives to the point that we are thinking and choosing the life we live.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog post is about men learning at work. By learning, I mean studying Torah.</p>
<p>I taught a class today at <a href="http://local.yahoo.com/info-20420152-t-h-store-fixtures-commerce" target="_blank">Teichman Enterprises</a>.</p>
<p>It was a really great experience and I was inspired and I want to share my feelings with you.</p>
<p>If you are looking for the Australian musical artists known as Men at Work who sing that great song called &#8220;Down Under&#8221; (the one the &#8220;<a href="www.piamenta.com/" target="_blank">Piamentas</a>&#8221; ripped off and sing to the words &#8220;Asher Bara&#8221;) <a href="http://www.google.com/musica?aid=NwPvaH7qe3P&amp;ei=QostSoOgL5WWswOe8rDOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=music&amp;ct=result" target="_blank">click here for Men at Work</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what I am talking about watch these two videos&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-746"></span><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='980' height='582' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/DNT7uZf7lew?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>Okay &#8211; got that? Now Watch this:</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='980' height='582' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Fig44jXBpj4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>Back to our previously scheduled blog post.</p>
<p>I heard from my Rebbe that he is often approached by men who work long hours and feel as if they are spiritually drowning because they have such limited time to work on their spirituality.</p>
<p>His advice was  that once a day, while at work we should contemplate on the reasons we are working. We are working to support a family, a wife, children, to provide the opportunity for them to grow Jewishly, so that we can send our children to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/17/speak-up-economic-crisis-hitting-jewish-day-schools/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">expensive</span> Jewish schools</a> and so we can give charity, and so that we can experience a beautiful Shabbos together and if we are able to focus on that for just a moment it can make a tremendous difference in our work. Literally transforming our mundane job into a spiritual activity.</p>
<p>Truly, this is a beautiful idea.</p>
<p>Today I witnessed and participated in an equal if not better solution.</p>
<p>Teichman Enterprises has a weekly Torah class in their office. A catered lunch and a Rabbi teaching Torah is sure to insert some spirituality into a mundane work week. It is the perfect way to integrate the spiritual with the more mundane.</p>
<p>I was privileged to teach the class today and I was inspired. The attendees were attentive, interested and thoughtful.</p>
<p>It is impressive that so many people were willing to take time off from work to come hear words of Torah.</p>
<p>Notable among the attendees was Meish Wilson from Venice and the Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>Today we learned about the special silver trumpets that were blasted before many moments in Jewish life. We learned about the root of sin and the path to recovery from sin as well.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I hope the attendees did as well.</p>
<p>(One correction, I mention R&#8217; Yehuda HaLevi in the class, in fact it was R&#8217; Shlomo Alkabetz, my error and I apologize.)</p>
<p>Today was a <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">big day for iPhone owners</a> and before the class we talked about the marvels of the iPhone over lunch. Thanks to the magic of the iPhone (and an app called <a href="http://www.italksync.com/download/" target="_blank">iTalk)</a> you can listen to the class on your computer right now!</p>

<p>Clothes has been a hot topic at the <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a> lately.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we supposed to talk about the number 50 in Judaism and why Shavuos is the only Jewish holiday with no set date. Instead, we talked more about clothes. Unbelievable.</p>
<p>This week we got back on track.</p>
<p>We completed Chapter 5 in Messilas Yesharim and learned about the 3rd and final detriment to &#8220;Watchfulness&#8221;. Do you want to know what it is?</p>

<p>Last week we began to learn about the detriment of scoffing or sarcasm to out spiritual growth. The general principle is that one who is incapable of seriousness about life will not be able grow spiritually. This week I had planned on completing Chapter 5 in its entirety.</p>
<p>However, we got no further in the text of Mesillas Yesharim this week.</p>
<p>Instead we had a truly invigorating discussion ab0ut &#8220;seriousness&#8221;. It is tough for us to relate to this section Mesilas Yesharim. We are allowed to make jokes, frivoility is not ALWAYS bad, so how can we bring this section down to earth and make is relevant?</p>
<p>One example that I cited for a moment as we began class was the way observant Jews typically dress. Have you ever wondered why observant Jews dress conservatively for the most part or wear &#8220;black and white&#8221;?</p>
<p>Much of what we talk about was related to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/" target="_blank">this post</a>, as well as these <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/13/clothes-in-the-nba/" target="_blank">posts</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/05/clothing-round-up/" target="_blank">this post</a> as well.</p>

This is to avoid becoming mired in materiality and neglected our spiritual needs.</p>
<p>Today we moved on to the next detriment. The next thing Ramchal teaches us to avoid is an overarching lack of seriousness. Perhaps it could be more precisely defined as immaturity.</p>

This week Connections was the second of a series of classes about the history, philosophy, structure and benefits to Torah study.

In preparation for Shavuos, when the Jewish people accepted the Torah, this was the perfect time for the series.

Tonight we did a quick review of last week, though listening online would be a better option. You will get the full picture that way.

		<itunes:summary>Moving right along in Chapter 5

We quickly reviewed last week and continued until we wrapped up category number 1 of &quot;things to avoid&#039; so as not to hinder our &quot;Zehirus&quot;.

The main idea is to avoid overwhelming oneself in materiality.

Also, a discussion ensued regarding our natural resistance to morality. It&#039;s like a magnet pulling us towards our instincts.

It was a great class with super pace and as always great questions.

<p>There is an incredible book about an amazing Rabbi. The book is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.judaicaplace.com/hiiofaafh/judaica/item.html" target="_blank">Reb Simcha Speaks</a>&#8221; By, Branfman &amp; <a href="http://www.tatz.cc/bio.htm" target="_blank">Tatz</a>.</p>
<p>It is not a biography of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcha_Wasserman" target="_blank">Reb Simcha Wasserman</a> rather it is an homage to his timeless teachings. Rabbi Wasserman passed away in 1992 and the book was published shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>I read the book when I was in Israel Henry Beren High School at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivas_Ner_Yisroel" target="_blank">Ner Israel</a> and the book had a profound impact on my thinking. I recommend picking up a copy of the book for your personal library.</p>
<p>Reb Simcha comments that in 1913 the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yisrael_Meir_Kagan" target="_blank">Chofetz Chaim</a> remarked that history was like a wheel that spins faster and faster. Progress was slow and plodding for generations. It took forever just to invent the wheel (people are still trying to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel" target="_blank">re-invent the wheel</a>). As time moves on progress comes quicker and exponentially greater.</p>
<p>I think the Chofetz Chaim meant history is like a spiral.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-536" title="Spiral" src="http://rabbifink.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/01spiral2.jpg" alt="Spiral" width="405" height="396" />The spiral begins slowly, one revolution takes a long time. But once things start getting closer to the center, the revolutions are much quicker. It keeps getting quicker and quicker.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Changes used to take a long time. Revolutions occurred over centuries. Nations lasted for millennia. Now, things change in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This is the exact idea found in the video. The world is changing at breakneck speeds. We are hurtling through history at an unprecedented pace. Today&#8217;s media darling is tomorrow&#8217;s &#8220;has-been&#8221;. The newest gadget will soon be obsolete.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">This insight from the Chofetz Chaim has two important ramifications.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">First, the idea of the spiral. A spiral is a naturally occurring phenomena. We find it on our planet and we find it in outer space. With this insight we now see it in a third parallel existence. History is also a spiral. Therefore, it doesn&#8217;t surprise us that changes happen overnight. The video shows a natural approach to history. It may not have been obvious to everyone in 1913. Today, it is a youtube video gone viral. 96 years later, the words of the Chofetz Chaim are available for anyone to see on youtube.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Second, when we travel so quickly through time we need to slow down our lives. It&#8217;s one thing to miss the newest iteratino of your favorite <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/default.htm" target="_blank">video</a> <a href="http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3" target="_blank">game</a> <a href="http://us.wii.com/" target="_blank">console</a>, but it does matter if we don&#8217;t enjoy our families and other daily blessings. We need to make sure we stop to smell the roses. Our world moves at such a fast pace but we can slow down our lives so that we are actually present.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In Judaism we have a tremendous gift called Shabbos. A few weeks ago I taught a class about Shabbos and how we can understand its place within the Torah system. The up-shot was to use Shabbos as a time to just &#8220;be&#8221; and not be distracted by the material world and its pursuits for 1 day a week. <a href="http://werejustbetter.com/pjc/Connections_03_16_09.mp3" target="_blank">Listen to that class and try to make Shabbos a real part of your life</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">If you do not celebrate Shabbos &#8211; please do not miss your own life. Slow down. Enjoy.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The video asks: So What Does This All Mean?</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It means, pay attention, your life is happening before your very eyes.</p>

There is an incredible book about an amazing Rabbi. The book is called &quot;Reb Simcha Speaks&quot; By, Branfman &amp; Tatz.

It is not a biography of Reb Simcha Wasserman rather it is an homage to his timeless teachings. Rabbi Wasserman passed away in 1992 and the book was published shortly thereafter.

I read the book when I was in Israel Henry Beren High School at Ner Israel and the book had a profound impact on my thinking. I recommend picking up a copy of the book for your personal library.

Reb Simcha comments that in 1913 the Chofetz Chaim remarked that history was like a wheel that spins faster and faster. Progress was slow and plodding for generations. It took forever just to invent the wheel (people are still trying to re-invent the wheel). As time moves on progress comes quicker and exponentially greater.

I think the Chofetz Chaim meant history is like a spiral.
The spiral begins slowly, one revolution takes a long time. But once things start getting closer to the center, the revolutions are much quicker. It keeps getting quicker and quicker.
Changes used to take a long time. Revolutions occurred over centuries. Nations lasted for millennia. Now, things change in a blink of an eye.
This is the exact idea found in the video. The world is changing at breakneck speeds. We are hurtling through history at an unprecedented pace. Today&#039;s media darling is tomorrow&#039;s &quot;has-been&quot;. The newest gadget will soon be obsolete.

First, the idea of the spiral. A spiral is a naturally occurring phenomena. We find it on our planet and we find it in outer space. With this insight we now see it in a third parallel existence. History is also a spiral. Therefore, it doesn&#039;t surprise us that changes happen overnight. The video shows a natural approach to history. It may not have been obvious to everyone in 1913.

Second, when we travel so quickly through time we need to slow down our lives. It&#039;s one thing to miss the newest iteratino of your favorite video game console, but it does matter if we don&#039;t enjoy our families and other daily blessings. We need to make sure we stop to smell the roses. Our world moves at such a fast pace but we can slow down our lives so that we are actually present.
In Judaism we have a tremendous gift called Shabbos. A few weeks ago I taught a class about Shabbos and how we can understand its place within the Torah system. The up-shot was to use Shabbos as a time to just &quot;be&quot; and not be distracted by the material world and its pursuits for 1 day a week. Listen to that class and try to make Shabbos a real part of your life.
If you do not celebrate Shabbos - please do not miss your own life. Slow down. Enjoy.

<p>The 5th Chapter is all about avoiding the things that may hinder our ability to be &#8220;watchful&#8221;. We need to know what we are doing before we can improve our actions. We need to avoid traps that will take our minds off of watching what we are doing.</p>

The 5th Chapter is all about avoiding the things that may hinder our ability to be &quot;watchful&quot;. We need to know what we are doing before we can improve our actions. We need to avoid traps that will take our minds off of watching what we are doing.

This is in the spirit of &quot;Sur Merah, Vaaseh Tov&quot; - Psalms 34. First we must turn away from evil and then we go towards good.

Ramchal gives us 3 things to avoid. We began the first of these today.

During the class we had 3 really great discussion.

Our first discussion was about the distance from our heads to our hearts and Tefillin.

The second discussion was about working for a living. The Torah approach is that one should earn a living to take care of our material needs and set aside time for Torah study to take care of our spiritual needs.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the upcoming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Ha%27atzmaut" target="_blank">Yom Haatzmaut</a> and <a href="http://www.aish.com/holidays/Yom_Yerushalayim/last/yom.asp" target="_blank">Yom Yerushalayim</a> holidays I felt it was a perfect time to discuss the role Israel plays within the Torah system.</p>
<p>For many people Israel serves as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East, for others it is a Jewish homeland where no Jew will be denied access, for others it holds tremendous historical value, there are others who cherish its spiritual significance and there are yet others who pine for the elevated Torah study of the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>Our goal was to find the meaning of the Land of Israel and its connection to the Jewish people from the Torah. We went to the source to find why there is an intrinsic connection between the Jewish people and the land of Israel.</p>
<p>This relationship did not begin in <a href="http://www.wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1040" target="_blank">1948</a>.</p>
<p>The class ended with some really interesting anecdotes (I don&#8217;t want to give anything away &#8211; but suffice to say, very interesting stuff) and a few great points from our Connections attendees.</p>

<p>We journeyed through the book of Genesis, The Scroll of Esther and the Talmud in search of meaning and reason. Why is Purim named after the lottery that Haman cast? Why did Haman cast a lottery?</p>

Tonight we continued our learning about Purim. Often misunderstood and misused, Purim deserves better treatment than that.

We journeyed through the book of Genesis, The Scroll of Esther and the Talmud in search of meaning and reason. Why is Purim named after the lottery that Haman cast? Why did Haman cast a lottery?

We answered a lot of questions tonight. The basic idea is universal but much of it is in the name of Rabbi Shneur Kotler.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Magilnicks of Venice / Santa Monica made a wedding last week. The Jewish custom is to celebrate the wedding with 7 days of parties if and when the bride and groom are present. Any time the bride and groom are present and there is a party there are 7 beautiful blessings which are bestowed upon the bride and groom. These parties and the blessings share a name. They are called Sheva (7) Brachos (Blessings).</p>
<p>Traditionally, there are several short speeches laced with blessings and good wishes for the bride, groom and their families.</p>
<p><span id="more-357"></span>The Magilnicks invited nearly the entire Venice / Santa Monica communities to celebrate the Sheva Brachos of their son Josh and daughter in law, Rivka. Rivka&#8217;s father was one of my Rabbis in High School at the Israel Henry Beren High School of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivas_Ner_Yisroel" target="_blank">Ner Israel</a>.</p>
<p>I was asked to deliver some words of blessing to the bride and groom. I chose to deliver a speech which my grandfather, Sidney Greenwald, would give at all his grand-children&#8217;s Sheva Brachos until his passing. I have been delivering his message since that time at family Sheva Brachos parties which I have attended.</p>
<p>It my hope that those who listen to the speech will find it as inspiring as our family has found it. His <a href="http://www.aish.com/literacy/lifecycle/The_Stages_of_Jewish_Mourning.asp#yartzeit" target="_blank">yartzeit</a> is this coming week and may these words of Torah said in his name be an aliya (growth) for his neshama (soul).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week at Connections we talk about clothes. Apparently clothes have been on my mind a lot. If you have been reading the blog you may have noticed that the recent posts all had to do with clothes. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/" target="_blank">I commented on the espn.com article </a>about wearing pants while playing basketball and then <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/" target="_blank">I commented on the President&#8217;s dress code</a>. While I was preparing for the Torah learning portion of <a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php" target="_blank">Connections</a> this week I was drawn to <a href="http://www.beingjewish.com/mitzvos/tzitzis.html" target="_blank">Tzitzis</a>.</p>
<p>We talked about clothing and the Torah&#8217;s associations with clothing. From Adam to Joseph to Saul we find a lot of negativity surrounding their clothing. What do I mean? Well you will have to listen to find out&#8230;</p>
<p>We learned about the numbers 6, 7 and 8 in Judaism and eventually we got to Tzitzis. We learned how Tzitzis can help us avoid the danger zone associated with clothing. There was an in depth treatment of how Tzitzis are made and what their construction requirements teach us.</p>
<p>We also talked about the difference between the Nazi form of Anti-Semitism and the Ancient Greek form of Anti-Semitism. The Ancient Greeks wanted us <em>to be like them</em> and forget Torah. The Nazis wanted us destroyed <em>because we not</em> like them.</p>

We learned about the numbers 6, 7 and 8 in Judaism and eventually we got to Tzitzis. We learned how Tzitzis can help us avoid the danger zone associated with clothing. There was an in depth treatment of how Tzitzis are made and what their construction requirements teach us.

We also talked about the difference between the Nazi form of Anti-Semitism and the Ancient Greek form of Anti-Semitism. The Ancient Greeks wanted us to be like them and forget Torah. The Nazis wanted us destroyed because we not like them.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we began the 4th Chapter of Messilas Yesharim.</p>
<p>The 4th Chapter deals with the method by which we can acquire the very useful characteristic of Zehirus (watchfulness). The fist step in the process is study of Torah. By studying sections of Torah that deal with inspiration and motivation we can give ourselves a much needed boost. This is in addition to the inspiration which comes standard with any Torah study. Ramchal first talks about the type of person who has already acquired much Torah and cares desperately about living his life the fullest. He needs little motivation to be vigilant in his Zehirus &#8211; he already cares passionately about using his time well. This serves as his inspiration. It is the fear of not succeeding that drives him.</p>
<p>Next week we will learn about Ramchal&#8217;s method advice for those of us still lacking in the Torah study department.</p>
<p>We enjoyed a nice discussion about the fear of failure as well.</p>

<p>Our topic tonight was the dietary laws of the Torah. Tonight we dispelled many of the myths about kosher. We discussed the origins of the English word Kosher and contrasted that to the Hebrew word for Kosher.</p>
<p>Kosher is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest" target="_blank">survival of the fittest</a>. The fittest food for human consumption. Fit in the sense that it is good for your soul. Soul Food.</p>
<p>We got pretty deep into understanding why food is so important in Judaism and how some of the dietary rules help us avoid &#8220;danger zones&#8221;.</p>
<p>The discussion ranged from <a href="http://www.boardgames.com/chutandlad.html" target="_blank">chutes and ladders </a>to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatica" target="_blank">sciatica</a>. (no kidding)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we completed the 3rd chapter of Messilas Yesharim.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous of Ramchal&#8217;s ideas is present in this week&#8217; section. I won&#8217;t ruin it for you so you will need to check it out for yourself&#8230;</p>
<p>As we completed the section we talked about practical applications of &#8220;Zehirus&#8221; and in what ares we need watchfulness. We are not rehabilitating murders, thieves and rapists in our class so where is the moral struggle for which we need watchfulness? As a group we discussed following our intellect over our instinct and areas where that may be helpful.</p>
<p>We also briefly mentioned the idea that when we make good choices they can become instinctive as well &#8211; but that is an acquired instinct resulting from our good choices. The bad instinct is the &#8220;child&#8221; within us that is selfish and is reminiscent of animal instinct.</p>
<p>What we are learning about is how to stop the child instinct from controlling us. Then we make good choices which in turn become instinctual&#8230; And that is a good thing!</p>

<p>Our topic tonight was Inspiration. Much of our discussion was rooted in R&#8217; Akiva Tatz&#8217;s distillation of some very profound ideas. The main idea revolves around the numbers one, two and three. Listen to the class to find out just what that means! We learned more about the secrets behind the splitting of the sea, why food spoils, how to make a marriage work and &#8220;coping&#8221; with the load of our daily lives. There was some really great input from the attendees including some science, geometry and philosophical thoughts.</p>
<p>All in all the class was exciting, the questions were thought provoking and everyone in attendance had a really nice time. It makes the preparation and delivery worth the effort when the attendees are so engaging and positive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we started the 3rd Chapter of Messilas Yesharim. Ramchal has given us the importance of Zehirus (watchfulness) and has taught us that we need to integrate this idea into our lives. What remains is the definitions of Zehirus. Today we began to uncover just what Zehirus actually is. Ramchal gives us the two main areas of Zehirus. Firstly we need to figure out what is right and what is wrong and then we need to figure if what we are doing is helping or hurting us in doing what is right.</p>
<p>We also discussed my previous <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/01/kobe-and-zehirus/" target="_blank">blog post</a> which prompted a short discussion on preparing for moral challenges and not just relying on our skill as moral warriors.</p>
<p>Finally we discussed examining your actions to see what is good and what is bad and then examining your good actions to see if they can be refined or improved in any way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had quite an interesting class today. Ramchal continues his explanation of the importance of Zehirus &#8211; watchfulness. The first point we discussed today was the idea that our animalistic instinct inside of us is very clever. One of his mian tricks is to keep us so busy with distractions that we don&#8217;t have time to think about our lives. We see this in our own lives all the time. We want to analyze ourselves and try and improve &#8211; there is just no time&#8230; This is one the many weapons in the arsenal of our evil inclination. It is the same idea George Orwell uses in 1984 to prevent all creative thought crushes the spirit and does not allow for any growth. The second topic discussed today was that we are promised that if we try our best then and only then we are promised the assistance of God. The idea is that if we don&#8217;t care enough about ourselves to make changes in our lives then no one &#8211; not even God is going to do it for us. The Ramchal ends off by invoking the Talmudic principle that if one does not care to grow then we are not supposed to work on that person Our time is much better spent other ways. This prompted a great discussion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We began the Ramchal’s chapter describing the characteristic of “watchfulness”. The main thrust of the section is that it is necessary to think about our actions that we normally take in advance of the actions occurring. So we prepare for life’s challenges by thinking about the potential challenges we will have and the past challenges we have had. After we are mentally prepared for all situations and circumstances we can be confident that we will prevail in those challenges that we encounter. Ramchal compares being unprepared for life’s challenges to a blind man walking along a river bank. The danger is near and the chance of catastrophe is greater than the chance of survival. I think it is clear that we must be watchful and to do this we need to begin by analyzing the situations life throws at us before they happen. There was also a discussion about how to cope with daily issues and we tried to use R’ Wolbe’s ideas about Seder. R’ Wolbe’s main idea is that Seder is a system / routine that we live by so that in case of a challenge we have a framework from which to react. In other words &#8211; the Seder is not for the sake of Seder rather it is for clarity when we need it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Liss did a tremendous job organizing and preparing the annual PJC Chanukah Party.</p>
<p>The kids and adults had a great time and we all thank Jeff for a job well done.</p>
<p>Tonight was a Connections night and I was on the program and I had to compete with the magician upstairs&#8230;</p>
<p>The question posed was as follows. The more significant miracle of Chanukah is the victory of the Maccabees over the Greeks in the physical and spiritual war in which they found themselves. There was another miracle of a small jug of oil lasting 8 days instead of 1 day. Why is the mitzvah of Chanukah to light candles connected to the miracle of the oil which is less important than the war? Why don&#8217;t we commemorate the war with a mitzvah? Secondly, why was a miracle of oil necessary? God does not just show off His abilities to perform miracles, there must a reason why the oil needed to last until new pure oil was available&#8230; What was so important about the oil burning for 8 days?</p>
<p>By the end of the talk we had answered those questions and touched on some relevant topics. Including the special qualities of fire and how to win a moral war in a spiritual wasteland.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

		<itunes:summary>Jeff Liss did a tremendous job organizing and preparing the annual PJC Chanukah Party.

The kids and adults had a great time and we all thank Jeff for a job well done.

Tonight was a Connections night and I was on the program and I had to compete with the magician upstairs...

The question posed was as follows. The more significant miracle of Chanukah is the victory of the Maccabees over the Greeks in the physical and spiritual war in which they found themselves. There was another miracle of a small jug of oil lasting 8 days instead of 1 day. Why is the mitzvah of Chanukah to light candles connected to the miracle of the oil which is less important than the war? Why don&#039;t we commemorate the war with a mitzvah? Secondly, why was a miracle of oil necessary? God does not just show off His abilities to perform miracles, there must a reason why the oil needed to last until new pure oil was available... What was so important about the oil burning for 8 days?

By the end of the talk we had answered those questions and touched on some relevant topics. Including the special qualities of fire and how to win a moral war in a spiritual wasteland.

Enjoy!

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ramchal continues his chapter on the role of man in this universe. Ramchal argues that no sensible person could really believe that the purpose of creation is for our existence in this world. If you think about it, an intelligent creator would not possibly crate the world that we live in as the primary place of existence. People suffer much of their lives and no one dies with their desires and dreams completely fulfilled. The system is constantly in break down mode! No one actually gets what they want. Further argues Ramchal there would no point in creating a soul which does not get any pleasure from our physical world. It seems like cruel joke on the soul! The soul was happy to stay in a spiritual place &#8211; why burden the soul with being created in to a physical world?! The only explanation that is sensible is that the soul and all of creation is truly created for its existence in the post physical eternal spiritual world. There the soul can enjoy the benefits of all it accomplished in this world. The soul is thus willing to go through the travails of this physical world in order to gain the pleasure of the next world. The way that the soul earns that pleasure is by perfecting the physical imperfect body that it inhabits. The way we achieve that perfection is by the performance of Mitzvahs. Practicing mitzvahs gives our souls the key it needs for entry into the next world where it can enjoy its place in the spiritual realms.</p>
<p>This soul talk prompted some lively discussion regarding the nature of the soul. The soul has a mission and while it is here it is our body’s job to assist the soul in accomplishing that mission. When the mission is accomplished the soul remains in its eternal home for eternity. If the mission is incomplete then the part of the soul that has not achieved what it was meant to do returns to the physical world. The cycle continues until the soul has done its job to completion. The current souls are all fragments of the original souls which appeared at Sinai for the giving of the Torah to the Jewish people and the rest of the world. The Jewish soul was infused with its mission at that time and therefore the Jewish soul originated at the point which that mission was delivered.</p>
<p>To us humans the soul is an enigma but if we are confident in the existence of the soul then Ramchal makes a strong argument that our ultimate purpose it greater than just the physical life in which we find ourselves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we continued our discussion of the purpose of man in this world. Ramchal deals with this central issue by offering 2 options for the existence of man.</p>
<p>Option 1: Man is created to perform in this physical world as best as he can. He is given mitzvahs (commandments) by God to help him do the best job possible while he is in this world. After man dies he reaps the rewards for that which he has accomplished in his lifetime.</p>
<p>Option 2: Man is created for his eternal existence in the world to come. That existence is based upon his actions in the physical world in which we live. This world is our opportunity to carve out a wonderful eternal existence. The mitzvahs are given to us as tools to achieve spiritual greatness as our eternal existence is spiritual and being in touch with spirituality will enhance that eternal existence. The physical world can also function as tools for our growth as long at is used properly.</p>
<p>Ramchal chooses option 2 as it justifies such a short lifespan in comparison to the eternity of the world to come. If we are to live such a fleeting existence that cannot be the purpose of our existence. He then goes on to describe the inner battle which we constantly grapple with. The rich has its challenges, the poor has its challenges. The intelligent has its challenges and the not so gifted has its challenges.</p>
<p>This prompted a discussion of a number of relevant topics. Firstly we discussed how each person has the opportunity for spiritual growth when we are presented with moral challenges. Each person’s moral challenges are their own and cannot be compared to another’s moral challenges. In other words when I am grappling with a moral challenge it requires a certain amount of effort to prevail in that particular challenge. That amount of effort is the same level of effort required by another person in their completely different moral challenge. Each one of us is challenged in different areas but it is futile to try and compare our challenges with another’s. I may think that your challenge is easier for me, and it may very be so, but for that person that challenge requires the same amount of moral effort that my challenge demands from me.</p>
<p>We also discussed the incalculable reward for mitzvah observance. This is for 2 reasons. Reason 1: we must do our best to successfully execute each mitzvah and if we were aware of which carried greater rewards then we may neglect some of the mitzvahs. This is tragic because the mitzvahs are all part of an intricate system of personal growth that requires the sum of its parts to function properly. Reason 2: For each person in their individual situation each mitzvah may in fact carry a different weight. For me one mitzvah may be simple while it is a challenge for you. This has an effect on the reward for each mitzvah relative to my effort required to execute that mitzvah.</p>
