It&#8217;s not our fault, picture and films from the era have clouded our ability to see those times in color.</p>
<p>Much of that era&#8217;s Jewish history is captured in black and white photos from Europe. It gives rise to a sense that their time was one of darkness and sadness, devoid of color. Of course this is completely false. (In fact, many would counter that the black and white mode of dress common among many orthodox Jews is more doom and gloom than the the modes of dress present in the 19th and early 20th century.)</p>
<p>I happened upon a selection of absolutely stunning color photographs taken in Russia in the early 20th century before the world was thrust in upheaval during the First World War. The photos are in full technicolor<span id="more-2754"></span> and they tell a compelling story with almost garish colors and of people unaccustomed to photography<sup><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/27/a-beautiful-peek-into-our-history/#footnote_0_2754" id="identifier_0_2754" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Compare that to the era of camera phones and Facebook photo albums, we are ALWAYS taking photos and we know just how to behave and act when we are being photographed. The subjects in these photos look almost as if they do not believe that a picture is being taken">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The article shows 34 photos. They are all worthy of your attention. However, I call your attention to Photo #16. (click for full frame version)</p>

(Prokudin-Gorskii Collection/LOC)</p></div>
<p>This photo shows Jewish children studying with their teacher. I find it beautiful. The boys are attentive. They are wearing various styles of yarmulkas. The teacher looks regal. They are sharing their books. And the CLOTHES are amazing! This is a rare, colorful and bright view of a Jewish Education of a century ago.</p>
<p>Some of my great-grandparents were in &#8220;White Russia&#8221; in 1910. They may have known these boys, they may even be one of these boys.</p>
<p>I feel so blessed to have seen this picture and I am pleased to share it with you.</p>
<p>Head on over to <a href="http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2010/08/russia_in_color_a_century_ago.html">Russia in color, a century ago</a> to see all the photos. Enjoy them.</p>

<img class="size-full wp-image-2751" title="Child Witches in Nigeria" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/child_witches_1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="202" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Child Witches in Nigeria</p></div>
<p>I saw this CNN article on a friend&#8217;s Facebook page.</p>
<p>There is a severe humanitarian crisis in Nigeria. I don&#8217;t know how much we can do to help but I think the crisis is emblematic of social issues in our culture as well.</p>
<p>Innocent children are being physically abused, even tortured or killed because they are thought to be witches. If a child can be blamed for a tragedy or illness by claiming they are a witch they will be outcast, then beaten and then abandoned to rid the community of the witch.<span id="more-2750"></span></p>
<p>Lack of education combined with the abject poverty these folks live under contributes to the social environment that allows for witch hunts. Lack of education and poverty in our country contribute to most of our social ills as well. Fear of the unknown contributes to hate and hate crime. While I don&#8217;t think we can do that much to change the environment in Nigeria (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/22/do-not-send-your-money-to-nigeria/">Do Not Send Your Money To Nigerian Spammers!</a>) we can make changes in our communities to help every child get an education and have an opportunity to climb out of poverty.</p>
<p>The video talks about a great man who is not gripped in the beliefs of these people and does everything he can for the accused witches. He maintains an orphanage for the abandoned and tortured children and unfortunately his facility is bursting at the seams.</p>
<p>There is a Facebook Page where you can help these children: Click <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=9476440119" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I suggest watching the video below and reading the original article on CNN.</p>
<p>One side note: According to the CNN article the exorcism and excommunication occurring in Nigeria is being done in Churches. It is being done with Pastors. It is a religious ceremony and considered to be part of Christianity.</p>
<p>I am sure nearly all American Christians would vehemently disagree with the beliefs and tactics of the Nigerian Christians. I think it is worthwhile noting that religious folks in Third World Countries living in poverty with little or no education tend to act irrationaly, violently and are extreme in their beliefs. This applies equally to Christians, Jews and yes, Muslims too.</p>
<p>Just something worth thinking about&#8230;</p>

<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>My friend was in crazy traffic (not crazy like the 3 month backup in China) and he had his tallis and shofar in the car and his friend had a camera. They were passing an Ikea and my friend chuckles to himself Ikeaaaa (sounds like Tekiaaaah) and the video was born&#8230;</p>
<p>(Further explanation: The shofar makes three sounds. One is called tekia. On Rosh Hashana someone calls out each shofar blast before it is blown. So before tekia he chants &#8220;tekiaaa&#8221;.)</p>

<p>My grandmother was celebrating her 70th birthday (that&#8217;s not so unique &#8211; right?) <em>AND</em> her recent Ph.D (yes &#8211; she just got her Ph.D). Veteran readers of this blog will remember that both my grandmothers work full time (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/31/my-thoughts-on-the-aughts/">My Thoughts On The Aughts</a>). That&#8217;s an accomplishment on its own merits!<span id="more-2737"></span></p>
<p>This grandmother, her name is Louise Fink, is the younger of the duo and she is a practicing clinical psychologist and the Head of Health Services for the Baltimore City Public School System, which means that she is charge of the mental health and special education departments for the entire BCPS. One might think that would satisfy one&#8217;s ambition. But not her. My grandmother went for her Ph.D while working full time at time in her life that most people contemplate retirement. All of this while she tended to her ailing husband who has since passed (may his memory be blessed).</p>
<p>Many friends and family attended the party. The only thing missing from the party was the press! Well, its 2010 and today&#8217;s press are the bloggers. I was there and I am reporting that yes it is true, Louise Fink is now Dr. Louise Fink Ph.D and a mother to incredible children, grandmother to wonderful grandchildren and great grandmother to adorable great grandchildren.</p>
<p>We have learned so much from our grandmother. We have learned about life, love, education, Torah and family from her. We have recognized her greatness for a long time and now it is time she is recognized publicly.</p>
<p>Thank you for being such a special grandmother, special human being (and reader of my humble blog).</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing many more milestones together!</p>

<p>Silly me. I actually thought that if people knew the truth about Cordoba House they would simply cease to oppose its existence. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/03/the-mosque-at-ground-zero-has-a-marketing-problem/">The Mosque at Ground Zero Has A Marketing Problem</a>)</p>
<p>Yet, weeks later, people still call it a mosque and people still think it is being built at Ground Zero and people still think it is being funded by Osama bin Laden and it will become a terror cell and the reason they are building the mosque is to proclaim victory for Islam etc etc etc.</p>
<p>I have seen several videos about the issue. I have placed two of the videos on this page. Watch them both and you decide who makes the more cogent, reasoned, fair arguments.<span id="more-2731"></span></p>
<p>I present you with Keep America Safe&#8217;s latest video:</p>

<p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger is quitting the over-the-air radio business. She has been forced into a corner with no apparent way out. Her resigning was demanded in the wake of her comments to a caller in which she used racial slurs to illustrate a point.</p>
<p>I am not defending Dr. Laura&#8217;s use of insensitive language, however I do not think she should quit or be asked / forced to quit.</p>
<p>Here is exactly what happened: (<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/opinions/view/opinion/In-Defense-of-Dr-Laura-4741" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>A black woman called the show and told Dr. Laura that</p>
<blockquote><p>her husband is white and his relatives frequently use hurtful racial language around her, including the &#8220;N-word.&#8221; In response, Schlessinger said &#8220;Black guys use it all the time. Turn on HBO, listen to a black comic, and all you hear is n*****, n*****, n*****.&#8221; Schlessinger also told her that &#8220;If you&#8217;re that hypersensitive about color and don&#8217;t have a sense of humor, don&#8217;t marry out of your race.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Predictably, there was a lot of backlash and Dr. Laura was forced to quit.<span id="more-2727"></span></p>
<p>The Dr. Laura flap reminded me of the Helen Thomas fiasco. Thomas was also forced to resign in the wake of her insensitive comments as well.</p>
<p>Thomas said something to effect of:</p>
<blockquote><p>Israelis should &#8220;get the hell out of Palestine&#8221; and &#8220;go home&#8221; to Germany and Poland.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thomas took the heat for a few days until she quit.</p>
<p>I think these stories are both tragic.</p>
<p>Yes, in both cases, the comments were insensitive. Would they like to take back their words if they could? Sure. So why don&#8217;t we let them?</p>
<p>Both of these women speak millions of words over the course of their careers. It is inevitable that they will slip up. Why are we so swift to demand they give up their careers? Have we become so sensitive that there is no longer forgiveness?</p>
<p>It goes to a deeper issue as well.</p>
<p>The distillation of thought and narrowing of acceptable speech severely hampers the ability for Americans to debate and discuss issues. The 1st Amendment protects our right to free speech. This right has been described as providing a marketplace of ideas. If we allow whoever yells loudest to bully the marketplace then the marketplace becomes dominated by that voice.</p>
<p>The proper response to speech that you find offensive is not deprive the speaker from speaking further.* It is by explaining why the speech is offensive and offering counter-speech. Discussion and debate. Not calls for resigning.</p>
<p>By allowing bullies to determine who is permitted in the marketplace if ideas and who is not permitted in the marketplace of ideas curtails the effectiveness of that marketplace.</p>
<p>Dr. Laura and Helen Thomas were important voices. They may be infuriating at times and they may have been insensitive. But that is not a reason for their voices to be lost. The marketplace of ideas has fewer voices and that hurts us.</p>
<p>The real losers in their resignations is us.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">*Severe forms of hate speech that are likely to incite violence or compromise the rights of others are not protected by the 1st Amendment.</span></em></p>

I confess to never seeing the ad on TV but I commend Verizon for putting their ads on YouTube. Sometimes ads are art. This is one of those times.</p>
<p>I also admit to using Verizon for absolutely zero services. I don&#8217;t like them very much, I think their logo is dated, their name is weird and their customer service is deplorable. But I know a good ad when I see one.</p>
<p>Do I think this ad translates into sales? Probably not.</p>
<p>It remains an excellent piece of art.<span id="more-2723"></span></p>
<p>Before Web 2.0 (user created content on the web) the public were consumers and not producers of content. That meant that a very select group of advantaged people became the voice of the people. Their opinions were the only opinions that mattered. This goes contrary to the American spirit of &#8220;We the People&#8221;.</p>
<p>That has all changed. The people have a voice. That voice is important (and can be disconcerting when we lose it, see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/13/your-unique-voice-and-a-kafkaesque-experience/">Your Unique Voice and A Kafkaesque Experience</a>). YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X36ACwwyscY" target="_blank">which will become YouTwitFace in the year 3000</a>) Blogging and commenting are the voice of the people. It is an almost completely democratic universe. If your content is good, people will read it or watch or discuss it. It&#8217;s a win for everyone.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t get it &#8211; watch the ad.</p>
<p>This ad gets it.</p>

(<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/29/my-visit-with-judith-clark-at-bedford-hills-prison/">My Visit With Judith Clark at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility</a>) I have learned a lot about the failures of our current system of incarceration and it sickens me. As a (realtively) outspoken individual I have made my opinions known to anyone who will listen.</p>
<p>I tell them that I am against prison in principle. I don&#8217;t think anyone should go to prison. It&#8217;s a waste of money and far worse it is a waste of a human being. People accomplish almost nothing while incarcerated. Society gives them a free ride and they produce next to nothing for society.</p>
<p>The first response I hear is usually related to the safety of society. That somehow we, on the outside, are safer if the criminals are isolated, on the inside.<span id="more-2713"></span> While this is generally true, most crimes do not affect the middle or upper class of society . Most crimes are not violent. Most criminals that go to prison have someone step into their place in their social circle and the crimes continue. I know this is a pretty weak position, but I think that incarceration is also a weak position.</p>
<p>The next thing that I hear is almost always a challenge. &#8220;Do you have a better solution?&#8221; To which I have been saying &#8220;I think so&#8221;. Prisons are as an old insitution. They hearken back to a time that it was the only option for incapacitation. The loss to society caused by providing criminals with a prison was worthwhile because there was no other real option. Incarceration is a old system that was the best they could do.</p>
<p>I propose that criminals be monitored. Conviction of a crime is a waiver of one&#8217;s privacy. There is no privacy in jail. Instead of tossing them in a cell and monitoring that way, criminals should be monitored by corrections officers. They can be mother or fathers to their families. They must find jobs, they must be productive members of society and  only if they lapse back into crime would they go to jail.</p>
<p>To me, this was a sci-fi idea that I had no way of determining its effectiveness or cost. Monitoring was a idea, but just an idea with no real data to back up the idea.</p>
<p>Last week I read a very well written article in The Atlantic (I don&#8217;t regularly read The Atlantic, I saw the article linked on Gizmodo) about Monitoring.</p>
<p>It demonstrates the feasibility of the idea and its preference over incarcertation for all but the most dangerous criminals. It explains how badly the current system is failing and the attractiveness of this alternative solution.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the article and I highly recommend the system as described in the article.</p>
<p>Currently, it costs about $50,000 a YEAR to incarcerate a criminal in California. No wonder we have a budget crisis. Monitoring is a much cheaper solution. It is a more humane solution. It is a more productive solution. It is the solution of the future.</p>
<p>The only question that remains is how long will it take us to reach &#8220;the future&#8221;.</p>
<p>I say, the future is now.</p>

Planes fly to even the most remote locations across the globe and high-speed fiber-optic cable connects the entire global community. I can virtually visit famous landmarks and have face to face conversations with people anywhere.</p>
<p>Almost 2000 years ago, the established Jewish community was based in the Land of Israel. Jews were living in Europe, North Africa and Babylonia as well, but the main community was centered around the Temple and communal religious life in Israel. The Temple was destroyed almost 2000 years ago and the diaspora began. Slowly, Jews migrated all over the world. Most prominently, the communities of Eastern Europe, the Medditeranean Basin and Babylonia established large Torah communities and much of Judaism today is the product of the generations of Jews who lived in those regions.</p>
<p>With the shrinking of the world, Jews from all backgrounds and ethnicities have become familiar with one another and a global Jewish community has evolved.<span id="more-2710"></span></p>
<p>Recently, I was sent an audio link (by Judd Magilnick) to a lecture given by Rabbi Marvin Tokayer. Rabbi Tokayer is an expert on the Jews of the Far East. His lecture was fascinating and it opened my eyes to an ancient Jewish community in China that I had only heard whispers of until recently.</p>
<p>Today, The Forward has a very interesting article about some Yeshiva students in Jerusalem who are Chinese. They hail from the Kaifeng Chinese Community and are trying to reinvigorate their lives and hometown with Judaism.</p>
<p>The only disappointing part of the article was the continued references to Marranos. The term Marrano refers to Jews who converted to Christianity during the Spanish inquistion but tried to keep their Judaism underground. They faced threats to their life and yet managed to keep many Jewish traditions alive for several generations. The word first meant pig and is a pejorative term for referring to these Jews. I prefer the more PC term of Converso.</p>
<p>Still, I highly recommend the article and I am hoping to continue to learn more about the Jews of the Far East.</p>

<p>However, as much as the ICC has a right to exist, this ad has a right to exist as well. The same laws that protect the ICC, protect this obscene ad. (Note: If the ad was so incendiary as to cause violence it would NOT be protected by the constitution, in which case it would lose my meaningless approval as well)</p>
<p>The irony is that the folks behind the ad can hide behind the 1st Amendment but would deny the same rights to the Cordoba Center.</p>

<p>That child&#8217;s name? Adolph Hitler Campbell. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2008/12/17/adolf-hitler-campbell-cant-get-a-birthday-cake/">Adolf Hitler Campbell can&#8217;t get a birthday cake</a>)</p>
<p>A little while later, I reported that the child, along with his siblings were taken into protective services. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/14/breaking-news-adlf-hitlr-campbell-update/">Breaking News! Ad@lf Hitl&amp;r Campbell Update</a>)</p>
<p>Following an appeal, Heath Campbell (the father) has lost custody of his children.<span id="more-2703"></span></p>
<p>The ruling is not based upon the names of the children: Adolf Hitler Campbell, 4, JoyceLynn Aryan Nation Campbell, 3, and Honszlynn Hinler Jeannie Campbell, 2. Rather, it seems Mr. Campbell has a bit of a mean streak. In a shocking development it was discovered that Heath Campbell used excessive violence and threats of violence against his children and his wife.</p>
<p>It is sad that these kids will grow up with the most offensive names in the world and now, without a father. But I suppose it is for their best&#8230;</p>
<p>And as a lesson to all of us, always treat your kids right, and that starts with naming them with a proper name.</p>
<p>(And a lesson to others, if you are too violent, depraved or moronic to procreate &#8211; DON&#8217;T! Thanks.)</p>

<p>The Westboro Baptist Church practices and preaches an extremely fundamental version of Christianity. They hold that God punishes American soldiers in Iraq because there are &#8220;Gays in the military&#8221;. They hate Jews because Jews are they killed Jesus and are the cause of fornication. They protest at shuls, Holocaust Museums and funerals of soldiers. They are fundamentalists and like many fundies are obscene, anti-social and hateful.</p>
<p>There are orthodox Jews who practice a very fundamental view of Judaism. They say that God killed<span id="more-2698"></span> the Haitians in a massive earthquake because of Gays in the military (or Lashon Hara) See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/04/why-the-earthquake-in-haiti-happened/">Why The Earthquake in Haiti Happened</a>. They say that Hurricane Katrina was punishment for Mardi Gras. They have been known to murder innocent people for the sake of their beliefs They hate liberals because they allow for depravity such as gay marriage. They protest all over on behalf of their causes.</p>
<p>There are Jihadist Muslims who practice a very fundamental and oftentimes violent version of Islam. They wish to rid the world of infidels, including Jews. They have bombed and fired weapons and thrown rocks in favor of their cause. They hate pretty much everyone that is not exactly like them and have no desire to integrate into a democratic society.</p>
<p>There are environmentalists who believe in a very fundamental version of liberalism. They are super passionate about the environment and nature. They stand in front of bulldozers, destroy private property and call people names all to protect nature. They put their lives at risk for their cause and spend millions of dollars promoting their cause. They put their cause above all else (for example instead of procreating) See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/22/green-gone-wild/">Green Gone Wild</a>.</p>
<p>In all these examples, the extremists make a lot of noise and find their way into the headlines. Would it be fair to associate these extreme elements with the more moderate practitioners of their ideologies? Of course not. I don&#8217;t want to be judged by the crazed acts of fundamentalist orthodox Jews and I am sure that moderate Muslims, Christian and Liberals feel the same way about the extremists in their ideologies.</p>
<p>Extremism is bad. Nobody likes it except the ones acting extreme. I find it disturbing that Islam is judged solely by its extreme and fairly recent activities. Prior to the 20th century, Muslims were far more benevolent to members of other religions than Christians were. Recently, extremists have become the face of Islam. I think that is unfortunate. It is our best interest to support moderate forms of Islam and help them fight against the extremists.</p>
<p>Are there dangerous forms of Islam? Yes. Are there dangerous forms of all faiths, beliefs and ideologies? Yes again. We should be working together to foster moderates who are tolerant of others in all walks of life.</p>

<p>It seems that the Cordoba House in downtown Manhattan has cleared a major hurdle by winning a 9-0 vote of the Landmarks Conservation Commission. (NY Times <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/mosque-near-ground-zero-clears-key-hurdle/?hp" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>Conservatives and liberals seem to be at loggerheads on this particular issue. Sarah Palin made headlines with her plea that the center be blocked and fellow right wing pundits have expressed their distaste to the center. They feel it disgraces the deceased by glorifying what they believe to be the religion that caused the tragedy at Ground Zero almost 9 years ago. Liberals, on the other hand, see the center as an olive branch to Islam and think the center glorifies America, not the dangerous form of Islamic Fundamentalism that took down the Twin Towers, 3000 victims and the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say whether the center is an affront or not.<span id="more-2689"></span> That&#8217;s because it varies with each person. Everyone is free to react as they choose. I can&#8217;t say one side is right and one side is wrong.</p>
<p>What I can say is that the center has a bad marketing plan.</p>
<p>The center is not a mosque. It is a massive cultural center. There is a sanctuary planned but it is a minor part of a broader institution. An institution that, according to their website attempts to bring the gap between Islam and the West. An institution that also fights for women&#8217;s rights and opportunitities within Islam. In fact, if we are to believe the Cordoba website, it is exactly what Americans (especially Conservatives) should be supporting.</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cordoba House is a Muslim-led project which will build a world-class facility that promotes tolerance, reflecting the rich diversity of New York City.  The center will be community-driven, serving as a platform for inter-community gatherings and cooperation at all levels, providing a space for all New Yorkers to enjoy.</p>
<p>This proposed project is about promoting integration, tolerance of difference and community cohesion through arts and culture.  Cordoba House will provide a place where individuals, regardless of their backgrounds, will find a center of learning, art and culture; and most importantly, a center guided by Islamic values in their truest form &#8211; compassion, generosity, and respect for all.</p>
<p>The site will contain tremendous amounts of resources that otherwise would not exist in Lower Manhattan; a 500-seat auditorium, swimming pool, art exhibition spaces, bookstores, restaurants &#8211; all these services would form a cultural nexus for a region of New York City that, as it continues to grow, requires the sort of hub that Cordoba House will provide.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why call themselves a mosque? Bad marketing.</p>
<p>The center is not &#8220;at Ground Zero&#8221; either. It is 2 blocks away. If you&#8217;ve never been to Manhattan you can&#8217;t appreciate how FAR part 2 blocks in NYC are. Two blocks in Manhattan is very far. It is a few minutes walk and more importantly, it is certainly not within the line of sight. They should be saying that their center is a few minutes walk from Ground Zero. Not &#8220;at Ground Zero&#8221;.</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ch_map.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2690" title="Cordoba Location" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ch_map.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>So the Mosque at Ground Zero is neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero. It is an Islamic Center in Downtown Manhattan. Is that still as offensive to those who oppose the center?</p>
<p>The only reasonable explanation for opposition that remains is conspiracy.</p>
<p>In other words, the website is a sham. The REAL purpose of Cordoba House is to spread Fundamental Islam and serve as a springboard for the continued spread of Islam in their quest for world dominance. This is Islamaphobia.</p>
<p>There are people who believe this to be the case. I do not.</p>
<p>If you are asking me, which you aren&#8217;t, I say support the Cordoba House and the brand of Islam they espouse and perhaps get involved a see it for yourself if you are not convinced. Working together will go a long way.</p>

(Read: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/14/ive-been-published-my-article-on-felony-murder-is-online-now/">I’ve Been Published! My Article On Felony Murder Is Online</a>)</p>
<p>In researching the subject of Felony Murder I was introduced to the case of Judith Clark by Professor Gilda Zwerman who accompanied me to visit with Judith. Judith Clark has a website all about her crime, time served and the way she has rehabilitated her life while in prison. (Link: <a href="http://www.judithclark.org/" target="_blank">http://www.judithclark.org</a>)</p>
<p>On Monday I had the opportunity to spend a couple hours with her in prison. It was very powerful.<span id="more-2684"></span></p>
<p>First, my overall impressions of the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility:</p>
<p>The prison experience at Bedford Hills contrasted greatly with my experience at &#8220;Twin Towers&#8221; in Los Angeles (largest jail in the USA). At Twin Towers there is a lot of intake and outtake. The inmates are constantly moving around, the entire facility is indoors and there is almost no sunlight anywhere. Bedford Hills is a sprawling campus with sunlight and grass. It gives it a totally different feel.</p>
<p>Also, the inmates had an different temperament from the inmates at Twin Towers. The women of Bedford Hills seemed pretty pleasant, there were a lot smiles and hugs and friendliness. At Twin Towers it was very much the opposite.</p>
<p>The coolest thing about Bedford Hills was their nursery / summer children&#8217;s program. They have great child care for children born while their mother&#8217;s are incarcerated. Even better is the summer program. Children stay in the neighborhood and come from 9-5 every day to spend the day with their mothers. The prison provides a nice outdoor area for them to play and hang out with their mothers and I got a great first-hand view of the benefits of a program like this. The kids were having such a great time being with their mothers.</p>
<p>On to Judith:</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that I could not stop smiling while talking to her. She has such a great energy and infectuous disposition that you just find yourself smiling the entire time you are with her. We talked for a long time about the crime and her Judaism and her daughter and her appeal (which she won but was later overturned for technical reasons) and her famous writing club and her pursuit of multiple degrees and her close relationship with the previous warden at Bedford Hills.</p>
<p>In short, we had a great time talking.</p>
<p>What was clear to me, was her regret for being involved with a radical group and her sincere effort to change as a person. I don&#8217;t think she is the same person she was 30 years ago. I do think that she is an incredibly strong woman with the ability to help inspire and change others. Unfortunately, she is stuck behind bars.</p>
<p>Her sentence was harsh. She pretty much asked for a harsh sentence during the trial. But she was young, immature and infatuated with a movement. That person is not in prison. That person has transformed into a new person who could do no harm the way she is now.</p>
<p>We put people in jail for a few reasons. Deterrence,  incapacitation, rehabilitation and retribution.</p>
<p>30 years in prison is a strong deterrent.</p>
<p>Judith Clark is not a dangerous criminal, there is no need to incapacitate her anymore.</p>
<p>Judith Clark is rehabilitated. I can attest to that.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t 30 years long enough for retribution? Retribution for driving a getaway car?</p>
<p>Seeing her in there breaks my heart.</p>
<p>But with my heart broken, I was once again inspired by Judith. Just before my visit was over she said &#8220;<em>If I died tomorrow how would I feel about my life? I&#8217;ve had a good life. It was severely limited by the walls of this prison, but I accomplished a lot and I am proud of who I am.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that what we all wish we could honestly say?</p>

My family still lives in Monsey so I always keep tabs on some the news and goings on in Monsey. This morning a fascinating post on LoHud.com (the Rockland County newspaper&#8217;s website).</p>
<p>The post confirms what everyone in Monsey and Rockland already knows, there has been a severe demographic shift over the last 30 years. You can see it with your eyes if you visit Rockland County and in particular Monsey. But seeing the data as presented by the post really drove home the stark reality.</p>
<p>According the post these are the most popular baby names over the last 30 years:<span id="more-2681"></span></p>
<p>The 5 most popular names in 1990:</p>
<p>Males: Michael, Christopher, Daniel, John, Matthew<br />
Females: Jessica, Amanda, Nicole, Samantha, Sarah</p>
<p>This represents a strong Anglo community. The names are typical of Christian families and middle to upper class Americans.</p>
<p>The 5 most popular names in 2000:</p>
<p>Males: Michael, Matthew, Joseph, John, Nicholas<br />
Females: Sarah, Samantha, Jessica, Nicole, Julia and Kayla (tied)</p>
<p>Again, a very typical list that is still consistent with a diverse community.</p>
<p>The 5 most popular names in 2008:</p>
<p>Males: Joseph, Michael, Moshe, David, Abraham<br />
Females: Esther, Rachel, Rivka, Chaya, Leah</p>
<p>Wow! All the names are consistent with Orthodox Jewish baby names. There are 0 Christian names. There are 0 female names that are not HEBREW! And there are 0 non-Jewish names for males.</p>
<p>Again, it just confirms what we all know. But the data makes it even more powerful.</p>

They have a nice website where you can see their mission statement and some of the other things that they do here: <a href="http://www.chailifeline.org/about.php" target="_blank">Chai Lifeline</a>.</p>
<p>Their flagship program is called Camp Simcha.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.campsimcha.org/" target="_blank">Camp Simcha</a> is a camp for cancer children and they vow to give these children the most fun and inspiring summer of their life (until next summer, hopefully).</p>
<p>Camp Simcha pulled off a really great stunt in Times Square this week. They got permits and arranged all the necessary medical logistics to make it happen.<br />
<span id="more-2673"></span></p>
<p>Apparently, the camp adopted the theme song of the World Cup for their camp theme song. The song is Wavin Flags by K&#8217;naan. It is a great song with a really powerful and inspiring message. But for these kids, the messages impact is compounded. (Videos all the way at the bottom of the post)</p>
<p>Here are the lyrics:</p>
<p>When I get older I will be stronger<br />
They&#8217;ll call me freedom, just like a wavin&#8217; flag</p>
<p>When I get older, I will be stronger<br />
They&#8217;ll call me freedom just like a wavin&#8217; flag<br />
And then it goes back, and then it goes back<br />
And then it goes back, oh</p>
<p>Born to a throne, stronger than Rome<br />
A violent prone, poor people zone<br />
But it&#8217;s my home, all I have known<br />
Where I got grown, streets we would roam</p>
<p>Out of the darkness, I came the farthest<br />
Among the hardest survival<br />
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak<br />
Accept no defeat, surrender, retreat</p>
<p>So we struggling, fighting to eat<br />
And we wondering when we&#8217;ll be free<br />
So we patiently wait for that fateful day<br />
It&#8217;s not far away, but for now we say</p>
<p>When I get older I will be stronger<br />
They&#8217;ll call me freedom just like a wavin&#8217; flag<br />
And then it goes back, and then it goes back<br />
And then it goes back, oh</p>
<p>So many wars, settling scores<br />
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor<br />
I heard them say &#8216;love is the way&#8217;<br />
&#8216;Love is the answer,&#8217; that&#8217;s what they say</p>
<p>But look how they treat us, make us believers<br />
We fight their battles, then they deceive us<br />
Try to control us, they couldn&#8217;t hold us<br />
&#8216;Cause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers</p>
<p>But we struggling, fighting to eat<br />
And we wondering, when we&#8217;ll be free<br />
So we patiently wait for that faithful day<br />
It&#8217;s not far away but for now we say</p>
<p>When I get older I will be stronger<br />
They&#8217;ll call me freedom just like a wavin&#8217; flag<br />
And then it goes back, and then it goes back<br />
And then it goes back, and then is goes</p>
<p>When I get older I will be stronger<br />
They&#8217;ll call me freedom just like a wavin&#8217; flag<br />
And then it goes back, and then it goes back<br />
And then it goes back, and then it goes<br />
And then it goes</p>
<p>And everybody will be singing it<br />
And you and I will be singing it<br />
And we all will be singing it</p>
<p>When I get older I will be stronger<br />
They&#8217;ll call me freedom just like a wavin&#8217; flag<br />
And then it goes back, and then it goes back<br />
And then it goes back, and then it goes</p>
<p>When I get older I will be stronger<br />
They&#8217;ll call me freedom just like a wavin&#8217; flag<br />
And then it goes back, and then it goes back<br />
And then it goes back, oh</p>
<p>When I get older, when I get older<br />
I will be stronger just like a wavin&#8217; flag<br />
Just like a wavin&#8217; flag, just like a wavin&#8217; flag<br />
Flag, flag, just like a wavin&#8217; flag</p>
<p>Anyway, the kids and staff sang this song with their flags in Times Square. It was pretty awesome, unfortunately the videos are pretty poor. But you get the idea anyway.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.uk.msn.com/world/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=154192555">Israel&#8217;s Outrageous Rape Case</a></p>
<p>Over on DovBear (<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/07/israeli-court-shames-itself-with.html">Israeli Court Shames Itself With Idiotic Ruling</a>) there is a fairly predictable post and discussion about the merits of the Israeli court decision.<span id="more-2667"></span> I am certain that the conversation over there is reflective of many similar conversations around the world.</p>
<p>There are two points that I would like to address regarding this case.</p>
<p>First, the issue of consent to sex is highly volatile. On the one hand, it protects women by punishing low-lives who force themselves onto women who may be vulnerable. On the other hand it is very paternalistic. It basically tells women that &#8220;you cannot be trusted with men so the law will take care of you&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is not politically correct to say, but women are more vulnerable than men as a general rule. Men tend to be bigger, stronger and more aggressive. Could a woman beat me up? Yes. Could a woman rape a man? I am sure. But the history of men taking advantage of women tells me that women do need protection by the law.</p>
<p>Second is the inherent racism in the case. And no, I do not mean the court is racist in its ruling.</p>
<p>I mean the &#8220;victim&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the man is Israeli it is okay to sleep with him after just meeting him, but if he is Arab then it is not okay to sleep with him?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that she feels this way. But what is the <em>basis</em> for her feeling this way? If she was very religious then perhaps she is concerned with the Jewish law of &#8220;marrying&#8221; a Jew. But I don&#8217;t think that is what it is.</p>
<p>I think it indicates a strong social aversion to Arabs in Israeli society. So strong that a woman who is willing to sleep with a new acquaintance would not do so if he was Arab.</p>
<p>The court is dealing with the facts on the ground. She would not have consented if she knew he was Arab. That legal issue deserves discussion. What I think is a more productive discussion is why she feels that way.</p>
<p>What factors are okay to consider before sleeping with a man and what factors are not okay? The court seems to think that ethnicity is important enough that her consent was voided. In Israel it is possible that it is that important.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Arabs feel 2nd Class in Israel?</p>
<p>I understand how and why that social reality came to exist.</p>
<p>I also think that perhaps it is more harmful than helpful at this point.</p>

<p><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/07/dancing-at-auschwitz.html"></a>Everyone has been talking about this video.</p>
<p>From the description:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>On a recent trip to Europe, a family of three generations (a Holocaust survivor, his daughter and his grandchildren) dance to Gloria Gaynor&#8217;s pop song &#8211; &#8216;I Will Survive&#8217; at concentration camps and memorials throughout Europe.</em></p>
<p><em>This dance is a tribute to the tenacity of the human spirit and a celebration of life.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Is it appropriate for a survivor and his family to celebrate their survival in this manner? Everyone seems to have an opinion.<span id="more-2657"></span></p>
<p>When I saw it, I was not &#8220;offended&#8221;, but then again, I am a 4th generation American. I have no Holocaust scars in my direct ancestry. It&#8217;s possible I am not as sensitive as I ought to be about this.</p>
<p>Having said that, I prefer to see this family as the modern day Rabbi Akiva who laughed when he saw the great Temple in ruins. When his weeping comrades asked him how he could cry at such a sight he reminded them that just as the destruction of the Temple was predicted, so too the rebuilding of the Temple and the return from exile was predicted.</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiva survived and he was confident that we would survive as a people. He was confident we would survive with our hopes and dreams intact even after witnessing a horrible event like the destruction of the Temple and the deaths of the thousands of Jews living in Jerusalem. The ever present optimism for the future has been a calling card for Jewish people for two millennia and Rabbi Akiva practically invented it.</p>
<p>On the eve of Tisha B&#8217;Av my father told me a wonderful Torah thought. At the end of the second chapter of Makkos there is an argument between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yehuda holds that if a man is exiled as punishment for a negligent homicide, when his term completes he cannot return to his position of authority (like prince of the tribe) that he held before his exile. Rabbi Meir holds that one returning from exile can reclaim his position of authority. Halachically we follow Rabbi Yehuda. But Rabbi Meir was the student of Rabbi Akiva. It seems that Rabbi Akiva had integrated this lesson into his worldview and taught it to his student Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Akiva had such optimism that the Jewish people would return from their exile and reclaim the lofty position in Israel, with the Temple that he laughed when he saw its destruction.</p>
<p>Seems to me, these folks are students of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Meir. We need optimism. We need hope for the future. We need to be confident in our future. Dancing at Auschwitz tells me that these folks have that optimism.</p>

We mourn the loss of the great Temple in Jerusalem, and all that it symbolized. We lament the loss of our national unity and the special Temple connection. We hope and pray for a complete redemption and the messianic era of peace, harmony and sprirituality.</p>
<p>(Read my thoughts on Tisha B&#8217;Av from last year: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/30/mourning-the-living-on-the-9th-of-av/">Mourning The Living On The 9th of Av</a>)</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with the custom to fast for 25 hours as a sign of our mourning. We suffer to try and feel what we are missing. For many people, Tisha B&#8217;Av is a fast day and nothing else.</p>
<p>That is tragic.<span id="more-2644"></span></p>
<p>Over on DovBear, (<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/07/gods-thoughts-on-tisha-bav.html">God&#8217;s Thoughts on Tisha B&#8217;Av</a>) my good friend Henoch has posted a very insightful anecdote <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2307.htm" target="_blank">from Zecharia Chapter 7</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the second Temple was being rebuilt, the Jews had been keeping the 4 fast days related to the destruction for the last 70 years. It occurred to residents of Bavel that perhaps these fasts were obsolete. After all, the Temple was being rebuilt, so why would they continue to mourn over its destruction? They assembled a delegation to go to Jerusalem where the halachic question would be brought to the leadership that still included Neviim. The answer given by God through Zechariah Hanavi is quite surprising and would be considered completely inappropriate had anyone else given that answer.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>At first the question of whether to fast or not, is ignored. Then Zechariah said in the name of God that when Jews eat at times that they deem appropriate, or fast when they decide to fast, they do so because it is what they think will serve their own interests. It isn’t necessarily for the right reasons. Zechariah essentially states that our idea of fasting misses the mark and even questions its’ sincerity. He then goes further and says in the name of God what would be a more proper approach to the subject. He says that the correct approach to this problem is to<br />
“Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassion every man to his brother and oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you devise evil against his brother in your heart.”<br />
Being that the Jews ignored these basic ideas, they were exiled and scattered across the world.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>God is looking at us and saying, it is quite simple, and it has always been quite simple. I don’t want false piety or even grand programs that are limited to fasting and davening. If you want to do them, that is your decision. But don’t lose sight of what I want. God says “I want honesty, compassion and love”.</p></blockquote>
<p>We cannot allow the secondary customs and practices to become primary. We cannot become so wrapped up in our customs, such as fasting, and forget the direct commandments from God.</p>
<p>We know what we need to do.</p>
<p>Please do not merely fast this year on Tisha B&#8217;Av. Take the lessons of Zecharia 7 and try to be the best we can be in all of our actions.</p>

<p>I really like the Museum of Tolerance. The overall message of the museum is a message that I wholeheartedly agree with.</p>
<p>Tolerance is a very important value in my worldview and the museum does a super job teaching that message.</p>
<p>(For a more complete review of the museum read my previous post <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/12/my-visit-to-the-museum-of-tolerance-at-the-simon-wiesenthal-center/">My Visit to the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center</a>.)</p>
<p>There was one thing I noticed, or rather, did not notice that I find necessary to question and perhaps even criticize.</p>
<p><span id="more-2623"></span></p>
<p>For all the talk and exhibits representing the horrors of racism, prejudice and segregation there was something missing. I could not help but imagine myself as a (hypothetical) average liberal, civil rights activist visiting the museum.</p>
<p>I am sure I would be impressed with the exhibits and their message. There is a possible segregation issue in one region of the world that is intimately related to the MOT. In fact this area is mentioned in various museum exhibits. Yet nowhere is the important civil rights issue mentioned or explored.</p>
<p>The region is the Middle East and specifically I am referring to Israel.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, there is a level of segregation on Israel. There is a more privileged class and a less privileged class. The Jewish Israelis are the privileged class. They control the policies and laws of the country. The less privileged class are the Arab Muslims in general and in particular the Palestinians living in Gaza.</p>
<p>There is a wall (depicted rather satirically in the photo above) that separates Israelis from Palestinians. There are laws that prevent some services and benefits from Gaza.  In essence there is a level of segregation.</p>
<p>Of course, supporters of Israel explain that these measures are not segregation &#8211; they are protection. They will explain that these policies are justified. That may be true. But on its face, the situation certainly has an appearance of intolerance or racism.</p>
<p>I wish the Museum of Tolerance would have dealt with this issue. It should be presented and rebutted to the best of their ability. If it cannot be rebutted the museum should not be ashamed to admit that. Its omitance seems problematic to me.</p>
<p>The issue is in fact at the forefront of many humanitarian groups. The UN takes it very seriously as well. I would have loved to see a well reasoned, clearly articulated, intelligent response.</p>
<p>Instead I got nothing.</p>
<p>I like the museum a lot. On this issue they can do better. A lot better.</p>

The course was very discussion based with some non-traditional law school reading. We also read the key First Amendment (Free Speech) cases and important Law Review articles on regulating hate speech.</p>
<p>I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Part of the course was a trip to the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.</p>
<p>I took my tour of the museum today. What follows are some general impressions.<span id="more-2617"></span></p>
<p>The museum is impressive. It is modern, hi-tech, welcoming and imformative. I have been to a number of the more prominent Holocaust Museums and exhibits. The Museum of Tolerance takes a unique twist on the Holocaust that I personally found more relevant than some of the other attempts to memorialize the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Perhaps most telling is the non-Holocaust exhibits. There museum has a universal message of tolerance and love that I can really relate to. I saw exhibits on segregation and prejudice. The truth is that even if there was no Holocaust exhibit, these exhibits made the trip worthwhile.</p>
<p>The Holocaust section focuses on the prejudices that existed in 1930&#8242;s Germany. The presentations are slick and grab your attention. The manner in which the information is presented is more like Epcot Center than a High School classroom. They use multimedia in a non-obtrusive way to convery their message.</p>
<p>The homage to shtetl life was sweet but I felt not entirely accurate. The romanticization of Jewish life in pre-war Europe is common and I only expected better from the MOT because they were so good at everything else they did.</p>
<p>As always, I was very drawn to the artifacts and Judaica on display. I absolutely love seeing real, used &#8220;things&#8221; from a time long gone. To see a Torah Scroll that was used hundreds of years ago, with its beautiful hebrew calligraphy and adorned with exquisite silver jewelry is very powerful for me. I also really enjoyed the day to day items on display. The collection includes a Cholent Pot from 19th century Germany. It is earthenware and marked with the words &#8220;Cholent Pot&#8221; and beneath that it has the family name. It looks really nice.</p>
<p>The overall theme of the Holocaust exhibit is that we all have biases. We need to work hard to overcome our prejudices to lead a more tolerant life. I agree whole-heartedly with that message and support the Museum of Tolerance in its work to disseminate that message.</p>
<p>If you are in LA or visiting Los Angles, make a few hour stop at the MOT. It will have an effect on you for a long time.</p>

<p>On Friday, my Bubby called me to tell me that I was quoted in the Baltimore Sun.</p>
<p>My math teached, Mr. Paul Miller was officially recognized by the City of Baltimore for his amazing accomplishment of teaching for 75 years, and he&#8217;s not done yet!</p>
<p>The Baltimore Sun did a nice write up and I was quoted at the end of the article.</p>
<p>They just lifted some lines from my blog post about Mr. Miller. I was not asked and they did not provide a URL. Is that okay?<span id="more-2611"></span></p>
<p>They also called me a &#8220;blogger from the Pacific Jewish Center&#8221;. Yes, I do have a blog, but is that a better credential than rabbi? Wait, do bloggers get paid more or less than Rabbis?</p>
