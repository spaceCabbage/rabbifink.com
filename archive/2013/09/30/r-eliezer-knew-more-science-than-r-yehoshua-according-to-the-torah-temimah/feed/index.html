		<description><![CDATA[I wasn&#039;t referring to ancient beliefs, but to the Pasuk itself, which is part of the description of the creation of the physical world. So what are the waters above the Rakiah, and the waters below the Rakiah?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The TT doesn&#039;t write &quot;R’ Yehoshua is confused because the ocean waters are salty.&quot;, rather more like &quot;R’ Yehoshua questions R&#039; Eliezer because the ocean waters are salty.&quot; And despite his scientific knowledge, TT doesn&#039;t negate R&#039; Yehoshua&#039;s opinion.



IMHO, if we could understand what upper and lower waters are, we would have a better grasp on their disagreement...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Indeed there are unanswered questions, but the Gemara implies that the reason for their dispute is interpretation of scripture, not science. Torah Temima&#039;s explanation can be taken as a way for us to relate to the mechanism according to R&#039; Eliezer, but not his reasoning. Same goes for R&#039; Yehoshua, the dispute starts way &#039;above&#039; science. (from my Rebbi)]]></description>
