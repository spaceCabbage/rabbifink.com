		<description><![CDATA[The joke definitely has to be in good taste and worth telling otherwise it takes away in every respect.  But just like a joke can take the &quot;fire&quot; out of sincerity and positive resolve, I think a joke can also disarm resistant negative forces.  Many people build up defenses against personal growth - some of it based on mockery and sarcasm - so the joke speaks that language, but since it&#039;s coming from the &quot;good&quot; side it opens them up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry to hear that you seem to be making jokes just because that is what everyone expects. It&#039;s good to try out new things that make you uncomfortable, and it&#039;s great that it turned out well. But, if it still makes you uncomfortable and you can&#039;t find a better reason to do it than it&#039;s expected, I sure hope you will stop. One of the most important things to me in a rabbi - and in any person in my life - is authenticity. If it doesn&#039;t feel authentic to you, people will notice it, and in the end I suspect you will lose more than you will gain.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rebbe— While you&#039;re right that no Catholic priest would joke during *most* of a liturgy, there are often jokes in the homily, which is the equivalent of when your joke happened, no?  



Now, would a priest open a sermon with a joke on Ash Wednesday or Good Friday, which would be equivalent in solemnity and character to Yom Kippur?  Perhaps on the former but probably not on the latter.  It would have to be the right joke.  And if it was, it would be a great opening, since those days tend to be on the . . . un-fun side?


Preachers are pretty serious from the pulpit in terms of their message, but depending on the preacher, there can be a great deal of levity.  I cannot speak for imams, though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[They do it to put the audience at ease. Look closely at the body language, at the instant the rabbi gets up to the podium everyone is sitting with straight backs (and thinking &quot;I sure hope this isn&#039;t too long&quot;), but then when the rabbi opens with a [funny] joke, they relax a bit, get comfortable, and open their ears and minds a bit further, and are ready to &quot;hear&quot; what the rabbi has to say. This applies to almost all public speakers.]]></description>
