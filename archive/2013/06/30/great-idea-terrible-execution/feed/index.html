		<description><![CDATA[Teach me to read the article :^)
Havign now read that, I agree with ahg&#039;s post that mass media attention can cause pushback and it&#039;s even probably within his rights to then force them out because they&#039;re media and protesters on private property rather than a protected class of people to be discriminated against.
I would hope that shoudl they come in one or two at a time and shop that they&#039;d be welcomed there as payign customers (even if people give them weird looks).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s a great idea, and the only problem with the execution was calling in the media.  When you walk in with the media at your side, then you&#039;ve taken your protest&#039;s intended show of good will and made it a publicity stunt.  People don&#039;t react well to publicity stunts.   The owner of the store may have reacted differently if the cameras weren&#039;t there. 



While ultimate progress may happen in a more quiet, behind the scenes way you describe,  I think to even reach that point, the community needs a wake up call.]]></description>

But this isn&#039;t really true. Once the price hits the correct level, they will leave. It always happens that way.

I guess it shows just how long I&#039;ve been out of that world that even though that&#039;s the obvious conclusion from the article, it just seemed so far fetched to me, I simply couldn&#039;t conceive that&#039;s what was going on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[up where i am, in monroe, we deal with a similar issue of insularity. unfortunately, this insularity has the potential to breed contempt on both sides. most people i&#039;ve spoken with (and most are from the non-chasidic part of the area) understand the frum desire to maintain a separateness from secular influences, but refuse to accept that being separate must be equated with not being a good neighbor. unfortunately in my area, that&#039;s exactly what happens, a lack of neighborly chesed and a constant attempt to circumvent established laws and practices, and a town board who, desiring the frum vote, caters to that portion of the community. unfortunately in ramapo, this lack of being a good neighbor has led to the destruction of the public school board, negatively affecting the schools, students, teachers, and parents who rely on public education. while i completely agree that going into rockland kosher may not have been the best way of attempting to foster community cohesiveness, i would think that even finding a way to break down the barriers that have been built over the years is, at best, a daunting task, and not one easily navigated by those unfamiliar with the nuances and customs of the frum community.]]></description>
