		<description><![CDATA[Studies of child abuse allegations suggest that the overall rate of false accusation is under 10%, as approximated based on multiple studies. Of the allegations determined to be false, only a small portion originated with the child, the studies showed; most false allegations originated with an adult bringing the accusations on behalf of a child, and of those, a large majority occurred in the context of divorce and child-custody battles.

		<description><![CDATA[Well said.  I think it&#039;s pretty clear at this point that the fear of false accusations doesn&#039;t come so much from a logical place as a place of fear and denial.  I think people would rather think that there is something wrong with one kid than leaders in their community, and perhaps their community at large.

I also find it fascinating that you see this at play in secular culture as well.  Many places, from faculties of schools to entire small towns, go out of their way to either dismiss or even vilify victims.

The difference is that secular culture has worked on building safeguards against this reaction.  Much of Jewish, and especially Haredi, culture clearly has not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[FACTUAL CORRECTION- 

You write: &quot;Then Kellner was convicted of obstruction for allegedly offering money 
for testimony and threatening to extort Lebovitz’s family.&quot;

Kellner was NEVER CONVICTED. He has been kept in limbo for two years since his arrest awaiting trial. Right now his lawyers as pushing for a trial date and the Brooklyn DA is trying to push it off. I am certain of the facts. I have closely monitored this case. You can confirm my assertion on Webcrims, the NYS criminal justice data base (Case # 02538-2011) https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/webcrim_attorney/Login]]></description>
