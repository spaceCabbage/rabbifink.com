		<description><![CDATA[here&#039;s the part i don&#039;t get about this:  where is the connection between her wearing an  in appropriate sweater... coming back  from israel..and boom she is in a one room apartment with a day job at age 17?   the rape episode was awful...but how does end up in  prostitution?   did her family really completely cut her off? if so, weren&#039;t there any other resources in the community to help her when she was on her own?   i have read comments from a person (on another blog) who knows the family well saying that there were college students in the family; and that the family was very supportive  but she had some  mental health issues.   
  i think the upshot here is that no one from the community should be left out on their own like that especially at such a young age.  where was the outreach, caring and support from the jewish community?  instead, now, she is a spokesperson for a non-jewish agency that helps people running away from religious life? oy.
   i don&#039;t know the whole story.  but there is a message here on how people who are different or who &quot;don&#039;t fit&quot; are treated.   i hope she will find a way to return
to observance and i hope that she and her family will be reconciled.   
obsevant jewish counselors and therapists, social workers..where are you!?
please see what you can do here because the publicity from this book 
and situation can be negative for all of us.  maybe someone can reach out to this young woman and see what kind of healing can be done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah the victim the victim the victim - just did not know that a man will take advantage of her? Poor minimum wage - but oh- discovers she can use her sexuality to get a scholarship to Harvard! Such a terrible life that her parents yelled at her. Sounds more like this - she was a brat - a poor misunderstood brat - whose parents called her bluff...so off she went into the cold cruel world and actually did just fine, thank you. It was not religion that made her go off - whatever her relationship with her parents, yes, tragic and unfortunate. Yet here she is, standing and accomplished - and the only thing she can think of, instead of saying, okay &quot;I Did Survive&quot; is &quot;How can I really stick it to my parents...Such self awareness, but no therapy...she is, essentially, still selling her soul for money. She is still, essentially a bratty little girl. Will NO ONE grow up in this country?  In the old days 31 was an adult. Not an adolescent looking for instant fame and attention...The story, is actually more mundane - girls goes off on own at 18 (gee, that&#039;s never been done.) Parents get her a job, and an apartment so she has a roof and a way to support herself (such cruelty)...oh my - it&#039;s MINIMUM WAGE!!! Meaning she might also have to work a second job - how can that be? No, no, no the cruelty.  No one has ever been young and stupid in NYC and needing to work to jobs...full scholarships? The horror! Puh Leeze - can&#039;t ANYONE call her on her sh*t??????]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I watched this impressive young lady tell her story I kept thinking what an asset she would be the Yeshiva University system. Instead of being shunned by her family and sent to fend for herself why didn&#039;t the Modern Orthodox embrace her? Indeed, why isn&#039;t there any outreach to those living in fundamentalist communities? 


It&#039;s time for the Modern Orthodox to stop acting like a lesser version of Orthodoxy and proudly represent what is True Orthodoxy; a place where thinking religious people can serve God and thrive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is is really unfair.  They used as nice terminology as they could to say that the accusations their daughter made were false.  They didn&#039;t want to say &quot;liar&quot; because of how harsh it sounds, so they tempered it.  Leah then interpreted their words to be saying she was crazy.  

Additionally, have you seen the entire letter, because in the clip they are quoting some lines (with elipses for removed words) from a much larger letter.  There is no way to know from that clip what her parents actually responded.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;But in the meantime, Footsteps is doing our work by helping those in our community who leave. &quot;

A few points:

--There was some discussion a while on Zev Brenner Program regarding Kashrus(from one blog):

&quot;At some point in the beginning, Michael mentioned that Footsteps serves kosher food. After the first caller claimed that Footsteps hosted a party in a non-kosher restaurant, and served non-kosher food, he had to explain himself that he meant they &#039;also&#039; serve kosher food. I can understand Zev&#039;s disappointment when he discovered that he previously misunderstood and thought they &#039;only&#039; serve kosher food. However as a Footstepper who attended that party and still eats only kosher meat, I knew exactly what Michael meant. I did not leave hungry from that party. I was welcomed with a sealed plate of delicious &#039;kosher&#039; shwarma, fries, and more. I got no negative comments from anyone for still keeping kosher to some extent.

And I want to ask this question. Where would Zev like us to have that party? In V&#039;Yoel Moshe in Williamsburg? And we should serve food with a big stamp of the supervision of... Reb Aron, Or Zalman Leib?&quot;

--Rabbi Yaakov Horowitz has recently written:

Of all the challenges to the family unit that are generated when an adult member goes OTD, perhaps the most stressful and potentially damaging scenario is when a father or mother of children who are school-age or younger becomes non-observant. If it takes the wisdom of King Solomon to resolve custody and visitation issues of children whose parents are on the same page religiously, just imagine how complex the situation becomes when the two parents have verydiffering views. 

Over the past few weeks, Project YES has been exploring the possibility of  conducting invitation-only meetings/workshops with family members faced with  situations similar to those described above. We reached out to both frum and OTD parents who are engaged in these types of custody battles, a family  court judge and two attorneys and feel that real progress can be made moving  forward if all parties remain flexible and keep the children’s needs in mind above all else

--Ruchie Frier, Founder of B&#039;Derech, a program for kids at risk, and also  Director of Ezras Nashim, a woman&#039;s emergency-response organization. While she is not targeting the same people as Footsteps, she is an example of an individual who is doing things for her community, such as giving people an opportunity for a  GED.

--In an interview in 2007 with Steve Savitsky on the OU website(“Wordliness and Walls”), Rabbi Dr. Aaron Hirsch Fried(Chasidish himself) praised Touro College’s Machon L’parnasha in New York as “hopeful and encouraging”, for giving Chasidim at ages 25-26, basic English and math skills so that they can go on to earn a degree. However, R. Fried notes(18 minutes in MP3) that:

“many of those young men are very angry now that when they were children or bachurim, when they were teenagers, they not given the skills that they now have to learn when they already have a house of 2/3 kids to support ”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are definitely missing a lot (see my comment of 10:54pm), but this is how *she* chose to tell her story. As far as the religious community and her parents being totally evil, I don&#039;t think anyone believes that to be true. However, the comments by her father, if he indeed made them, seem to indicate that he&#039;s completely written her off. And good parents rarely do that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is so much that we are missing here. I feel that all these stories are out there with a few sound bites, but the real stories are not as scandalous as they are made out to be.

Watching these two clips posted above you are left with the impression that Leah wore a tight sweater, was flown back from Israel, dropped off in NYC on the way home from the airport, to fend for herself. 

It&#039;s made to look as if the religious community and her parents are totally evil.

I am sure the full story tells a much different tale.

I guess when her book comes out we&#039;ll be able to read her take on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;Our system didn’t work for them. No system can work for everyone.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

What do you mean by &quot;system&quot;?

If by &quot;system&quot;, you mean &lt;i&gt;shmirat hamitzvot&lt;/i&gt; , then yes, the &quot;system&quot; can &quot;work&quot; for each and every Jew.

If you mean any given hashkafa doesn&#039;t work for everyone:  of course!  So, instead of Footsteps taking in ultra-yeshivish and chassidish young adults and helping them feel good about sinning, we ought to have a group reaching that same audience, and helping them find a hashkafa that can &quot;work&quot; for them.

Unfortunately, I&#039;m not aware of any organization like that.

This may explain why I&#039;ve never met a former kharedi who moved directly to dati leumi.  They all became totally khiloni first, usually for several years, before they found their way into a community of shomrei mitzvot again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although I&#039;m a little skeptical of her story, or at least confused by it, it&#039;s clear to me that she went through some very painful experiences growing up.  Even is she is totally lying, you&#039;d have to have a very messed up relationship with your parents to make up stuff like that.  It&#039;s very sad that things ended the way they did.  Perhaps some family therapy (and I mean real therapy, not some fake &quot;counseling&quot;) might have helped this family 15 years ago.  I can&#039;t believe that sending a 17-year-old to fend for themselves is ever the right answer.  Unfortunately, many in the frum community see that as a way to &quot;protect&quot; their other kids from the bad influence of an OTD child.  Ultimately, angry adults telling their story on national TV ends up doing much more harm.]]></description>

First she was insulated in school, then she felt &quot;apart&quot;, then she told parents she wanted to go to college, instead they send her off to Israel, then she wears the tight sweater, then they bring her home, then ... missing info ..., then they throw her out.
