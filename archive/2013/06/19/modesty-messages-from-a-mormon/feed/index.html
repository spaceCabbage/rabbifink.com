		<description><![CDATA[&quot;All the talk of Tznius is having an opposite of its desired effect on so many people in our community. It has gone from reasonable to extreme to laughable. &quot;

This is an excerpt of an article I liked  by R. Aryeh Klapper on the Text and Texture(RCA) blog titled  &quot;Reflections on Tzniut and Beit Shemesh&quot; :

1. Tzeniut is a broad Jewish value whose practical expression is opposition to unnecessary and meretricious self-exposure, whether of the body or of the soul.  It relates to all people, male and female alike, and all of life.  Reducing it to a code for women’s dress and actions reflects an unhealthy obsession, equivalent to reducing love to an expression of (exclusively male) lust.

2. Tzeniut is intended to preserve and expand the domain of intimacy.  Intimacy is constructed by exclusivity of exposure, by sharing things about oneself that one does not share broadly.  People with inadequate emotional boundaries are less capable of achieving relationship though emotional sharing, and people with inadequate physical boundaries are less capable of achieving relationship through physical intimacy.

3.  Tzeniut is intended to preserve the integrity of personal space – physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.  People who “spill” emotionally compel others to respond to them – to feel pity when they express suffering, anger when they express betrayal, and the like.  This legitimately feels like a violation.  The same is true of unwanted touch, or of unwanted visual erotic stimulation.

4. Tzeniut is one value in the complex web of Jewish values, which must constantly negotiate its place in that web.  It can be trumped, or attenuated, when it comes into conflict with other Jewish values.  From the halakhic perspective, once tzeniut is correctly defined as unnecessary self-exposure, it becomes clear that it should not be applied mechanically, but rather on the basis of a sensitive and dynamic understanding of the necessary. 

It should be clear that excessive tzeniut can be pathological.  People who never share their emotions do not experience ultimate intimacy, but rather intractable loneliness.  People who never react to others’ emotions do not become fully developed selves, but rather stunted and selfish.  The goals of tzeniut can only be fulfilled in a society that fosters intimacy and empathy. 

Similarly, in the erotic realm tzeniut is intended to maximize the space for marital intimacy, not to make husbands and wives chary of each other’s bodies, and to give people autonomous control of their sexuality, not to disassociate them from their physical selves.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Will a budding Torah scholar with Yeshiva bona fides write an article like this? Are we ready for this conversation? These are tough questions but I think we will be doing a world of good by trying to answer them.&quot;

The topic of discussion of sexuality is complicated by differences in age,  personality differences, public or private discussion, and hashkafa of  a community--all of  which need to be taken into consideration. The traditional approach has been the advice of the Chafetz Chaim to his son, that the less  open discussion--even in private-- the better; however, that was in Radin(a point mentioned by Rabbi Dovid Sapirman; see as well Dr. AJ Twerski&#039;s approbation, available online, to Sarah Diament&#039;s book).

The essential point, as I see it, is how one balances mussar and psychology. Also, public discussion is difficult for more than reason, but private is different.

A few resources on the subject:

 --Dr. Benzion Sorotzkin has an esssy on his website titled &quot; Torah Perspectives On Boundaries, Restrictions And Sexuality&quot; and  a MP3 from a workshop he gave for Ohel. 

--There are recently published books for parents by Sarah Diament and Dr. Yocheved Debow(see the latter&#039;s  article in the most recent Jewish Action). 

Regarding educational approaches in general,  Rabbi Lawrence Kelemen writes in the most recent Jewish Action: 

&quot;When I poll Bais Yaakov graduates about their emotional associations with certain mitzvos, I often find that they feel very warm about the mitzvah of taking challah and very cold
about the mitzvah of tzenius. Do we teach these two mitzvos differently? And if we do approach these mitzvos differently, and one approach produces long-term results that are so much better, why don’t we always use the more successful approach?

How do we teach kids to take challah? We make a party, with music playing, and bake delicious bread while laughing and having fun. How do we teach tzenius? We clobber our students. We are harsh. We single students out and embarrass them in public. We toss kids out of school for violating a chumrah. We blame communal tragedies on our children’s
lack of tzenius.

Tzenius is one of the few areas where we behave at home and in the classroom as if we know nothing about chinuch. Then the kids reject tzenius, so we parents and teachers feel the need to be even harsher—it’s a nonproductive, vicious cycle.&quot;

 Rabbi Doniel Frank, M.Ed., LMFT writes in Klal Perspectives(Summer 2012-available online):

&quot;The Rambam (Isurai Bi’ah, 22:18) describes the temptation toward illicit behavior as the Jewish people’s most difficult challenge – and that was before the Internet. Yet too often, family and school offer little more than prohibitions, punishments, and shaming. A cat-and-mouse game thus tends to play out throughout these critical years, leaving youth to falter
and struggle alone. Opportunities to provide meaningful and relevant hadracha hadracha 
are typically forfeited, often sending the message that neither the Torah nor the community has any constructive guidance regarding the issues of life most immediately relevant to them.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that it is mistaken to tie modesty so closely to sexuality. Obviously there is some connection, but tzniut bears on how we present ourselves to the world generally. If a woman wore a bright orange, sparkly burka, would that be more modest than simple clothing that covered somewhat less? Guidelines for modest dress are like guidelines regarding appropriate speech: don&#039;t curse often, don&#039;t speak too loudly or too softly for the situation, and, yes, don&#039;t be too explicit regarding certain topics. Yet we are not taught to think of ourselves as under attack by sin whenever someone in earshot is rude or disrespectful. We may become accustomed to a certain level of propriety and feel somewhat uncomfortable when that is not present, but I think that that is a natural and healthy reaction to being thoughtful and sensitive to your own words and others&#039;. Dress and bearing are a language, no less than the audible, and we should be just as thoughtful and sensitive to the messages being conveyed non-verbally.]]></description>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mormons like everyone else, while almost everyone else dislikes Mormons.  &lt;b&gt;Jews are the exceptions, as they give Mormons a net positive rating&lt;/b&gt; (suggesting that there is a perceived commonality, given that they are both minority religions).&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
