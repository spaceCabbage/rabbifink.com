		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This despite the fact that I can guarantee that post would have reached 50,000 views within a couple hours.&quot;


With all due respect, I&#039;m surprised you wrote this. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s particularly commendable that you removed erroneous information despite the temptation to get more traffic on your blog. That&#039;s just normal practice. To imply that it&#039;s commendable sets the bar very low for displaying integrity, which we all already know you have to a higher degree than this.]]></description>
