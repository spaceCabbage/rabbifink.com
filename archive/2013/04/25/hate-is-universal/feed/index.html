		<description><![CDATA[And, in fact, the teens were aghast and told him &quot;how can you not hate them?!!???&quot; and he replied, &quot;well, I don&#039;t love them, I don&#039;t even like them, I abhor what they did and what they stood for, but I don&#039;t hate them. The word &#039;hate&quot; should be reserved for the their kind of feeling.&quot; (something along those lines, I am paraphrasing here)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;There is no rule that states that people must hate one another in order for the world to spin on its axis. It can end and it will end. But let’s not limit ourselves to working on Jew hatred. All hate is the same and all hate can be fixed pretty easily.&quot; &lt;/i&gt;

Optimism. I feel both envious and superior.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;no, I don&#039;t hate anyone, because if I did, I would be just like them

I wouldn&#039;t say this to him, but if you can&#039;t hate people that slaughter humans like they are nothing but rats, then I think there is something wrong with your moral compass. Hate, is not necessarily wrong at every situation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On Yom Hashoah a few weeks ago, I attended a program at which one of the speakers was Mr. Norman Frajman. He was a young Polish boy that ended up in the Warsaw ghetto, and was later transported to Majdanek where his family was gassed and cremated and he remained alive as a slave laborer. Later he was transported to a few other camps including Buchenwald. He was liberated near the end of the war while on a death march. He told us that when asked by a group of teens at the March of the Living, if he hated the Nazis, and in general when asked that question, he replies &quot;no, I don&#039;t hate anyone, because if I did, I would be just like them.&quot;]]></description>
