		<description><![CDATA[That anyone considers Yated an authority an anything anymore is laughable! They will soon go the way of The Jewish Observer and make themselves obsolete. Pinny must be panicking big time as he realizes that readership is declining, and he must try to become relevant on the web that is forbidden by all of his Rabbeim and followers. How is that for irony! Pinny - dontcha&#039; know, we&#039;ve grown tired of viewing 30 pages of the same people in the same hats at different venues - every week!! For those of us nebuchs who don&#039;t live in the Tri-state area, we get to read about events 3 weeks after they happen. Eli, your father should have his own blog, or write for Mishpacha, or some publication that does not fear critical thinking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t tell if that was serious or not, but if it is. and if it is representative of attitudes in her community I have a few questions for those who hold it:

1) Was R. Yehoshua ben Hananiah degraded by working as a charcoal burner?  Hillel Hazakein by gathering wood? Are your kids better than they were?

2) Would Dovid Hamelech been a better king if he hadn&#039;t done all that menial shepherd stuff first?  Moshe Rabbeinu?

3) If you are learning to be a &quot;prince&quot; is any of your learning l&#039;shmah?  How do you understand the mishna in Avot about not using the Torah as a shovel to dig with?  or not learning to be called &quot;rebbe&quot;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That Herzog letter is just incredible. It really illustrates well the way certain ideas take on a life of their own. This woman has been so indoctrinated by the chareidi world&#039;s rhetoric against work that she isn&#039;t just against working when it takes people away from learning, but even when they aren&#039;t in yeshiva at all!

And her elitist and arrogant attitude about torah learners... my god, I can&#039;t imagine what a conceited jerk she&#039;s helping to raise (all in the name of torah true yiddishkeit, of course).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do have a subscription, had for a little over two years. As far as I am aware they do not publish any criticism of individual or group wrongdoing. To their credit, they have published some (relatively mild) critical pieces about long-held &quot;truisms&quot; within the community (R&#039; Tzodek Katz&#039;s piece on the &quot;shidduch crisis&quot; comes to mind), but that&#039;s about it.
They have, though, declared open season on YCT and the IRF, and have published harshly critical articles on those institutions and on people within them. Some of this could be discerned peeking through the relatively benign news article proper last week on the RMB scandal. This &quot;double standard&quot; is usually defended with appeals to the power of YCT and the IRF to &quot;destroy traditional Torah-true Yiddishkeit&quot;. They usually preface these pieces with variations on &quot;We wish we didn&#039;t have to do this, but we must in order to save Yiddishkeit&quot;.

Not to defend here, but I think there&#039;s also a subconscious notion that they think exists in their readership that &quot;charedi Jews do not commit crimes or malfeasance&quot;. I think that part of the reason that they just do not publish anything of that sort is that they truly believe in some part that reading these things will cause cognitive dissonance and someone to &quot;leave the fold&quot;, so to speak, so better a fool should live and a thousand wise men perish, so to speak.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aside from his lack of research on the topic that he was writing, that would have informed him that R. Student&#039;s blog as not at all as he described it, and it was consistent for him to not to engage in criticism of his R. Broyde - he doesn&#039;t see his own hypocrisy.  When was the last time Yated published an article critical of chareidim (who were not already convicted criminals)???   I don&#039;t receive Yated, so I don&#039;t know the answer for certain, but somehow I doubt you&#039;ll see criticism of chareidi leaders in there.   

Did Birnbaum write critically of R. Moshe Sternbuch when he declared that &quot;...the Mizrahi are haters of religion....The Zionists and infidels are the Amalek in this 
generation who want to destroy religion.... the fact they have a kippa on their head, is a 
shmatelke, nothing else...?&quot;   Was there anything anywhere in Yated encouraging his followers to remember that we&#039;re all brothers and sisters and they shouldn&#039;t speak that way?

Does anyone think there will be an article critical of  R. Moshe Ze’ev Zargar for his &quot;psak&quot; this week that chareidim should throw out IDF soldiers who come to their shul and study halls (for prayer and learning) while wearing their uniform?

Why would he expect anyone to criticize their own, when they can&#039;t bring themselves to do the same for themselves?

 He doesn&#039;t see his own hypocrisy - and chareidim never seem to.]]></description>
