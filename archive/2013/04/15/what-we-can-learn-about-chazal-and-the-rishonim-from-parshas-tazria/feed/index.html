		<description><![CDATA[I just want to publicly thank you, Rabbi Fink, for sharing your approach.   I too find the more rational approach that you (and others) take to be emunah enhancing.  In fact, I find the opposite to be true - those that are always seeking present Chazal as infallible instead of dealing with these issues in an open and intellectual manner tear down emunah and emunas chachamim.


The problem with the approach of Charles Brown, and school of thought his view represents, is that when you repeatedly put your best foot forward, and gloss over the problems, it eventually becomes transparent to the more critical thinkers and credibility is lost.


I think it&#039;s important for the Charles Browns of the world to know that their way can be very damaging and there is tremendous value, especially in our day, to a fundamentally different approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Welcome.


1) It actually proves my point. I was very specific about what I meant as far as Chumash learning being stifled. I said &quot;we donâ€™t learn or teach Chumash the same way our ancestors learned Chumash. Instead we teach Chumash the way our ancestors taught it.&quot; This holds true here. Artscroll is not innovating, they are telling us what RDTH taught here. It&#039;s the same thing as telling us how Ramban taught something just a more recent source.


2) I have no idea what Rav Soleveitchik said or meant or if he actually even said what you say he said. I can tell you what I think. My opinion, and it&#039;s just that - an opinion, is that Chazal made many statements based on social conditions. If they made a takana or a gzeira based on those conditions, it is still binding. However, if they give an aggadic interpretation based on a social condition we are not forced to believe or accept that the social condition they presume is superior to another social condition of a previous or later time. Specifically you asked if the idea that women prefer to marry is Divine. I don&#039;t think so and I see no reason to believe it is beneficial to accept that it is Divine.


3) I don&#039;t think this is the MOST important lesson at all. I do think that it is a huge challenge for contemporary Jews to read the rishonim at the beginning of Tazria. I provided an approach that is a way of understanding the rishonim in this week&#039;s parsha. For me, it improves my emunah and my emunas chachamim. I greatly prefer fallible gedolim who erred in matters of medicine than the alternative - I am not even sure how one would articulate the alternative, perhaps &quot;siding with Chazal and Rishonim over science and medicine&quot; - I&#039;m not sure. But either way, this is good for my emunah and the emunah of many others. I think it is a great principle that we should be proud to proclaim that our great rabbis used ideas contemporary to their times to interpret the Torah. I think that makes their insight even greater. I am not sure why you make so many assumptions about how I think and what I take from a post like this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ariella&#039;s husband here.  I have now read your post.  Three comments/questions: 1) You point to the &quot;somewhat stifling manner of Chumash study which hardly allows for innovation and reinterpretation&quot; prevalent today, yet your example proves the exact opposite to be true.  Even Artscroll, not known as a left-wing publication, chooses an innovate reading by R&#039; D. T. Hoffman rather than simply presenting the &quot;traditional&quot; approach of the Rishonim.  2)  You write that, &quot;social conventions were not Divine.&quot;  I am curious whether you accept the idea that social conventions found in Chazal, e.g. the gemara&#039;s assumption that women prefer to marry (even a poor choice for a husband) rather than stay single, are Divine.  After all, it made sense it the days when a woman was financially dependent on her husband and when her entire place is society was defined by his position, but hardly seems an appropriate assumption in our society.  Yet, Rav Soloveitchik held that one who disagreed with Chazal in this regard is an apikores.  Do you differ?  3) A personal question: There are so many people in the world (myself included!) who need chizuk in their shmiras hamitzvos, in their emunah, in their commitment.  As a Rabbi committed to strengthening those areas, do you truly think that the most important lesson to convey from this week&#039;s parsha to a wide and public audience is that Chazal and Rishonim are fallible in their views?  From a Jewish education perspective, might it not be better to at least publicly put our best foot forward and teach people what is great about Chazal and Rishonim and how deep their insight into everything was?  Im Rishonim kmalachim...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Be careful about your assumptions:  I&#039;ve heard a father speak at a bris, and it was very clear that the previous string of girls was a disappointment. And he was not a super right winger type at all.  Also, I don&#039;t think one has to take it as a medical belief just because the Rambam indicates that he did so.  Rabbi Knohl does not. If you haven&#039;t yet read his sefer, do get it. It&#039;s an amazingly frank discussion of taharas hamishpacha issues. Mazria for women, obviously, does not release seed, as ovulation occurs cyclically.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From a point of fact, girls do cost more than boys, especially in the frum community. Seminaries typically charge more than yeshivos. Girls&#039; clothes cost more than boys&#039;. And, then, of course when the weddings arrive, the girls&#039; parents typically foot the larger portion of the bill.

Of course a woman&#039;s egg is not blood, but a cell. As for a son being born if isha mazria techila, the Maharal offers an explanation along the lines of the last influence being the one that determines the most. But the one that most appeals to me is the one Rabbi Knohl presents in Ish v&#039;Isha, reviewed in  http://www.examiner.com/article/what-they-didn-t-teach-you-school-jewish-intimacy-and-pre-wed-classes-part-5]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a matter of being happy not being there. There is an element of unhappiness on off days for the marriage. That reason is given in a very sound source, but as the longer impurity would take effect in the case of twins including a daughter, it doesn&#039;t hold for all cases. Needless to say, the point is moot today when a woman would have the minimum niddah count of 5 plus 7 clean days after birth, and usually has to go much longer as post-partum bleeding can last for weeks. My husband addressed the question here on his blog http://divreichaim.blogspot.com/2013/04/why-difference-in-time-for-tumas-leida.html]]></description>
