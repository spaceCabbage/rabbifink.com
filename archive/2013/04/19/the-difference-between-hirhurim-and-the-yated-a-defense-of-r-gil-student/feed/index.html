		<description><![CDATA[I think R&#039; Maryles is talking about the article starting with &quot;Mr. Maryles is especially adept...&quot; Completely inaccurate.


I have to say I disliked the Yated piece for the same reason I disliked this post. You both insert unnecessary, needlessly abrasive, and sometimes unsupported statements.


Examples:


1. &quot;As if anyone who reads the Yated read Orwell...&quot;


2. &quot;I doubt any of the Yated readers will check Hirhurim for themselves to see if the levied criticisms are accurate.&quot; (Evidence???)


3. &quot;But that’s not the way of the Yated or its readers.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[evidence,,,,cute little boychick.

look, you can try and find grey area and nuance in this all you want.  go ahead.

this is much simpler than that.

MO criticize yeshivish community online, consistently.  period.  (I am talking more about the commenters, but applies to the tone and subjects of bloggers too)

RARELY criticize their own.  now, an opportunity to show the fair and balanced attitude of MO and its gone!  just like that!  LOL  what a shocker.

they are friends, there is no evidence of their assertion, bla bla bla ....its all noise.
if you would remove yourself from this and look objectively you would see the hypocrisy]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, you need evidence to support that claim that yeshivish people doing the same thing are torn to bits.


Second of all, I did write a post saying what RMB did was wrong. No silence here. I did even more on Facebook.


Third of all, the bulk of the criticism against the Yated is not whether Gil MUST condemn RMB or not. It was about their lack of support for all their assertion.


Fourth of all, Gil didn&#039;t comment because he is friends with RMB! He doesn&#039;t have an obligation to throw his friend under the bus!]]></description>

<p>Third of all, the bulk of the criticism against the Yated is not whether Gil MUST condemn RMB or not. It was about their lack of support for all their assertion.</p>
<p>Fourth of all, Gil didn&#8217;t comment because he is friends with RMB! He doesn&#8217;t have an obligation to throw his friend under the bus!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Ummmm . . . It&#039;s a fair criticism on the day that the Yated writes an article in which the Spinka Rebbe apologizes for his financial crimes (enumerated in said article), or Nechemya Weberman describes how he was indiscreet in his dealings with counselees.

R. Gil posted Rabbi Broyde&#039;s confession. That instantly puts Hirhurim on a higher plane than the chief media outlet in the campaign to canonize St. SM Rubashkin.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To me it seems like a fair argument, even in light of the bashing yated does.

Hirhurim claims (as you do) to be a more open forum than some yeshivish newspaper or website, MO are more open and fair....we look at all sides, we make up our own minds after reviewing all arguments, we don&#039;t &quot;blindly follow&quot; our leaders, etc.  
yet when one ITS OWN leaders is caught doing something bad, and all else equal, a yeshivish guy doing the same would be torn to bits on this blog...but not a peep!  
what happened to fair and balanced ?!?!  what happened to evaluating all arguments??!  nope.  silence.  quiet.  no comment.
I think this is a fair criticism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot; I went back and did some research. I looked at several weeks of blog posts on Hirhurim. It’s not so much that Hirhurim bashes charedim, it’s more like Hirhurim completely ignores charedim. I know that it does not feel especially good to be ignored,  but being ignored is hardly akin to bashing.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

To be fair, the article didn&#039;t accuse Hirhurim of publishing negative articles about Charedim, but rather of linking to articles &quot;bashing&quot; charedim, and that Hirhurim commenters are hostile to Charedim.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Hirhurim has also been a &lt;b&gt;site featuring links to articles&lt;/b&gt; that bash or expose percieved Charedi misdeeds. It is fair to say that a week does not go by.... without some ostensible Charedi misdeed &lt;b&gt;being linked&lt;/b&gt; to the website. Many of the &lt;b&gt;commenters who post&lt;/b&gt; on the website viciously attack Charedim.... What seems to interest &lt;b&gt;those who frequent Hirhurim&lt;/b&gt; are scandals... attributed to Charedim...&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

(emphasis added)

Yated&#039;s attack on Hirhurim is even more over-the-top than you write, since they&#039;re just accusing Hirhurim of guilt by association. But still, let&#039;s portray what the article said accurately.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed, this Yated op-ed is unfair, slanted, and just plain wrong in many ways.  Its hard to insert a Yiddish inflection into a blog post, but R Gil&#039;s response, as to his pre-Jewish Channel state of mind, was correct:  &quot;Who knew?&quot;  Nevertheless, despite the Yated&#039;s six emailed questions being poorly phrased, biased and insulting (&quot;mouthpiece&quot;), I don&#039;t see any harm, and see a benefit, in Gil  easily responding.  After all, before printing, Yated did follow the journalistic ethic of seeking comment from the subject of the article - that is to their credit.  And there&#039;s no sandbagging here - no journalist lurking behind a bush, as Gil is walking to his car, trying to get a poorly phrased spontaneous quote.  This also not a hurried phone call from a journalist, where a spontaneous sound byte can be used out of context.  The emailed question and answer format has benefit for both journalist and interviewee, in that it allows for contemplation and reflection (I prefer it).  Yated can also, with some justification, say that they&#039;ve been insulted by the &quot;no comment&quot; response - not that I think that this was Gil&#039;s intent - and they wrote the op-ed in accord with feeling blown off.   I hope Gil can respond in some fashion, as I&#039;m guessing he will, especially because he&#039;s so clearly in the right.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Yated has double standards also.

If there is  a heter to mention R. Broyde’s name in a negative context or others in Modern Orthodoxy when they criticize their positions, how come no names of high-profile Charedim are mentioned in the Yated when they are in the media for negative reasons? It seems the Yated, like all people are human, and its easier to criticize those outside your own orbit.

As far as the Yated mentioning Orwell, there is an irony. Rabbi Avi Shafran wrote about Charedi newspapers(“The Jewish Week’s “Haredi Problem”):

“Gary[Rosenblatt] might reply that, well, haredi papers don’t exactly include non-haredi, and certainly not non-Orthodox, points of view. That is true. But haredi papers are very open about their mandate, which is entirely limited to providing the haredi community with news it needs and haredi views of current events. They are not, for better or worse, intended as forums for the broader Jewish community, and make no such claim.”

Speaking of ironies, the author of the Yated article is actually one of my favorite columnists. While I don’t like this type of article, most of his articles I consider thoughtful and “devarim hayotzim min haleiv”, and his columns are the first I turn to read. There are also other worthy features in the Yated, despite the above aspects which I disagree with.]]></description>

Ironically, it&#039;s Emes v&#039;Emunah that discusses Charedim, and Charedi issues, MUCH more often than Hirhurim does, usually discussing negative issues with a tinge of apologia.


Maybe Birnbaum isn&#039;t attacking R&#039; Harry Maryles and Emes v&#039;Emunah as much because some of R&#039; Harry Maryles&#039; children are Charedim ... real Charedim and fully accepted in their respective Charedi communities.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well said. Leaving aside the smaller quibbles (not sure when a student-edited law journal became a department of YU), for a publication that puts its fingers in its ears and hums in the face of its community&#039;s most horrific behaviour to take Gil to task for not joining the chorus against RMB is truly the (cholent) pot trying to call the kettle black.

From where I (a disappointed fan of RMB) stand, he seems to have behaved in a way that brings his position into disrepute, whether he can justify it or not. Gil is in a tough spot, and I don&#039;t see how he can not make a more formal statement about this. But to take his actions as some sort of general indictment of how MO Jews keep their heads in the sand in a manner and magnitude of that of the Yated community is a bird that just doesn&#039;t fly, so to speak.

Another Orwell quote for Yated, while they&#039;re getting all literary, although something tells me they already know this one.

The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by 
his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing 
about them.]]></description>

But to take his actions as some sort of general indictment of how MO Jews keep their heads in the sand in a manner and magnitude of that of the Yated community is a bird that just doesn&#8217;t fly, so to speak.</p>
<p>Another Orwell quote for Yated, while they&#8217;re getting all literary, although something tells me they already know this one.</p>
<p>The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by<br />
his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing<br />
about them.</p>
