		<description><![CDATA[This is a religion which divides the world into dar al Islam (the realm of Islam) and dar al harb (the realm of the sword; c.f. Hebrew &quot;cherev&quot;, Aramaic &quot;chalaf&quot;). There is a NewSpeakish element in there, as Islam really refers to &quot;submitting&quot; to A-llah&#039;s Will, but here they&#039;re punning with salam, peace / wholeness, as is evidenced by the contrast to harb. The language makes it hard to separate observance from the concept of peace, even when that observance called for war.


Getting to my point... Non-Moslems comprise a world of fighting. Need I say more about non-reformed Islam&#039;s inherent violence?


(Alla-h is cognate to the Hebrew &quot;E-loah&quot;. There is no real reason to hyphenate &quot;God&quot;, although once it became the norm in our circles, I could make an argument against making a point of breaking that norm. But writing &quot;A-llah&quot; without the hyphen in a more permanent way than the image you&#039;re looking at of a web page and then throwing it out might actually be a problem.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All the non-Muslim oppressed that you mention, turn to violence against their local oppressors.  Muslims turn to terrorism against the world.  It&#039;s not a &quot;kill the Jews&quot; thing, it&#039;s not a &quot;kill the other gang&quot; thing, it&#039;s not a &quot;kill the white rulers&quot; thing.  It&#039;s an &quot;eradicate the world of non-Muslims&quot; thing.  

Islam is a movement whose leaders, preachers and teachings incite, not because the US oppresses Al Qaeda (for example), rather, to turn the world into an Islamic society.

This is a quantitative difference between the Islamic violence and all other &quot;no other alternative&quot; violence.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I also told stories out of the authorized biography of Mohammad. I agree that Islam today, at least in the eyes of 85-90% of its adherents, no longer adheres to an ethic where truth is more valuable than life, and non-believers should convert of die. But that&#039;s a drift from Islam&#039;s roots; Jesus&#039;s diciples don&#039;t brag about playing soccer with someone&#039;s head because he criticized their teacher. It took reformation to make Islam a peaceful. In contrast to most other contemporary religions where it takes extremism to justify violence. And that&#039;s why so many Moslems seek military solutions to their problems, whereas other religions do not &quot;boast&quot; a population of 10% willing to support terror against civilians.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are quote mining and literally translating verses from the Quran.  Islam does not consist entirely of the Quran.  It has many other works and commentaries and you can&#039;t understand a religion just be reading one of their books (in English without authoritative commentaries).  You are not being fair.


I could do exactly what you did with the Torah and Nach and make Judaism out to be a dangerous, genocidal, depraved, corrupt and immoral religion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not sure that the perpetrators think of the violence as senseless of casual. It isn&#039;t just a spontaneous manifestation of rage, like mob violence. It is calculated and meticulously planned with a clearly articulated motive. And the Tarnaevs did not live &quot;in developing countries, under oppressive regimes, with poor education, and little chance for freedom or financial success.&quot; However, I agree that the correlation is there, and perhaps the causal similarity is a sense of alienation and hopelessness. Give people a meaningful opportunity to succeed and they are much less likely to turn to terror.

Nevertheless, the possible connection between religion, culture and violence cannot be easily dismissed. Most pacifist resistance occurs in non-Western (Judeo-Christian-Muslim) societies. But I think it&#039;s a bit hypocritical for Jews and Christians to label Islam more violent (does anyone remember Baruch Goldstein?).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What if Jews lived in deplorable conditions, under oppressive regimes, with poor education and little hope for financial success and advancement, confined to refugee camps (ghettos) - Would they react by going on a mindless rampage and killing their neighbors, men, women and children?   Would they send their own children to die in a senseless act of violence and then revere them as martyrs?

I guess we&#039;ll never know the answer to that entirely hypothetical question... because nothing like that has ever happened to Jews anywhere -ever.]]></description>

What about Ghandi, Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, MLK Jr or the countless others who have effected political change through pacifist civil disobedience? Not all oppressed, uneducated, enslaved, or poor resort to violence.

I am not arguing whether Islam leads to fundamentalism or whether Jews or Christians wouldn&#039;t resort to violence if forced to face the conditions you describe. Just that isn&#039;t inevitable all people of all cultures in all countries would respond the same way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not a surprise that Bill Maher and Sam Harris are now on the same page as Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, Michael Savage, and the usual parade of bigoted imbeciles.

&quot;Thinking&quot;, to paraphrase George W Bush, is &quot;hard work&quot;, and when you&#039;ve got low-information sycophants telling you that you&#039;re a GENIUS like Maher &#038; Harris (primarily, because those sycophants are half-wits), it&#039;s probably easier to believe your own hype. 

Bill Maher (like Limbaugh, Bill O&#039;Reilly, etc.)  would never, ever equate the barbaric war crimes committed by MY TRIBE (meaning the USA)  as on a par with the behavior of the &#039;singularly evil&#039; OTHER TRIBE (MOOOOOOOSLIMS!!!). Sure, Maher thinks the Iraq war and a government policy of torture and murdering innocent people was &quot;bad&quot;, but , HEY, THAT doesn&#039;t compare to spooky Islamic terrorists who do what they do for RELIGIOUS REASONS (as if George W Bush, who admitted to consulting with Jesus before executing &#039;Shock n&#039; Awe&#039;, is just some humorous tidbit).

Over the past decade upwards of one million innocent people were slaughtered and tortured in Iraq in what is easily the worst act of terrorism in the 21st century - &#039;Shock n&#039; Awe&#039; (The very DEFINITION of extreme terrorism). No Muslim architects behind that unspeakable savagery. The &quot;good guys&quot; that set out to not only bomb a sovereign nation &quot;back to the stone age&quot; (remember that &#039;awesome&#039; boast), then immediately instituted a torture regime that spread across the world from concentration camps like Gitmo &#038; Abu Ghraib to black hole sites where people charged with NO CRIME WHATSOEVER have been locked up indefinitely, tortured, and murdered under the cloak of government secrecy. To say nothing of Obama murdering innocent people in drone strikes to this day in Pakistan, including US citizens.



Bill Maher needs to get guests to tear apart his naive BS that the crimes committed systemically by the USA are somehow &quot;different&quot; or &quot;not the same&quot; because the US doesn&#039;t praise Allah when we do it]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While that&#039;s part of it, it&#039;s not the whole story. For example, why are there so many Moslem countries fail to get beyond developing to developed and to break out from under oppresive regimes?

And have you read Ibn Ishaq&#039;s Sirat Rasul All-ah (Ibn Ishaq died about 130yr after Mohammed)? It&#039;s a very bloody book. And held up as an example. While most religions can be distorted by people who look to violence as a solution to their problems, Islam is distored by liberals who do not seek such solutions.

Mohammed starts his violent career by killing 4 unarmed merchants of the Quraysh tribe.

He lead a band of 300 men to raid a caravan and again killed 70 Quraysh merchants in Badr. Then followed up to slaughter much of the Quraysh army when it came to defend them.

At the Battle at the Trench, he had Al Nadr ibn al Harith killed for having the nerve to say he could tell better stories than Mohammed. Mohammed rejoiced when they threw his head at Mohammed&#039;s feet. In fact, a number of the victims of Badr were decapitated, bodies hacked to pieces after death, etc..

At this point, Mohammed entered a treaty with the Quraysh at Haduybiyeh. (Arafat y&quot;sh compared Oslo to this treaty on a number of occasions). Mohammed violates the treaty less than two years later to attack and conquer Mecca.

Mohammed sent people to kill Asma bint Marwana for writing verse in protest to what he did in Badr. But not after pulling her infant off her breast and hacking it to pieces, making her watch them kill her other three children, and raping her. The Prophet&#039;s words &quot;You have done a service to A-llah and his messenger; her life was not worth even two goats!&quot;

A month later he had an elderly poet killed (Abu Afaq, said to be older than 100) for his protest.

Now we get to his love of Jews. He laid seige to the Jews of Banu Qaynuqa for 15 days. When the starving survivors surrendered, he tried to initiate a massacre. The Jews&#039; ally Abdallah ibn Ubayy forcibly stopped him. Their property was seized, and the prettier women taken as sex slaves.

Mohammed organized at least 86 violent ventures, 26 of which he lead himself. Whether true or not, that&#039;s what Orthodox Islam teaches. Fortunately, that&#039;s only 10-15% of the 1.22bn Moslems who are willing to support terror or engage in it themselves. Unfortunately, that&#039;s still 122mm violent people following in his footsteps.

Thank G-d, most Moslems are &quot;Reform&quot;, but the difference between the effort to reform a religion to make it peaceful and distorting it to justify violence is the difference between Islam and the other more populous religious communities.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You claim that Bill Maher is wrong.  You made an argument to support your stance that people of other religions today would be just as jihadist as as the Muslims are if their material situations were the same.  That implied that values are not the determining factor, when evidence shows the opposite.  That&#039;s how we got here.
Muslims have primitive values because their religion got stuck in the past, a less morally evolved than today past.  If their religion reformed it&#039;s values, things would change.  I&#039;m guessing that wont happen anytime in the near future if at all...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oops.  I wasn&#039;t clear.  I meant I don&#039;t know why you think people are more likely to get there values from material factors.  

I get that you are choosing social causes but it&#039;s very frustrating because the signs point in the other direction.  Some people on the thread have mentioned some concrete evidence. What is your evidence?

Let me ask you something I heard Dennis Prager say once.  If you were in a dark ally alone at night and you saw a group of gang member looking guys walking towards you, would you be less afraid if they had just exited a church with Bibles in their hands (obviously having just left a Bible class)?

I would definitely be less scared in that situation and alternatively, I would be more scared of a Muslim coming out of the mosque on a Friday if I lived in Iraq.  In other words......It&#039;s the values.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;I think values are malleable and they are more likely to follow the other factors than to follow religion.

I don&#039;t know where you get that from and I disagree, but it doesn&#039;t matter.  It doesn&#039;t matter if values can change or where they come from.  The question is do they matter?  Do they play a role in people&#039;s actions?

&#062;All religions have abhorrent values in their texts. Only certain kinds of people act on them or even believe in them.

That&#039;s the point!  Islam is the only exception of that today.  A huge percentage of Muslims believe in those abhorrent values and a bigger percentage are willing to tolerate the ones that act on them even if emotionally, they find those acts distatesful or contrary to modern moral sensibilities.  This is because Islam never went through a reformation like Judaism and Christianity.]]></description>

It&#039;s that people are sick of the bullshit P.C. that often comes from Liberals, their intelligentsia in the universities and some of their puppets in the media that resort to all sorts of apologetics gymnastics that go along when they try to defend Islam at every turn. And here was a major Liberal sick and tired of it as well.  And that fact that you call what he said &quot;nasty&quot; is actually proof of the ridiculous P.C. that goes around and pussy footing around any truth that chas veshalom might offend anyone.]]></description>

You&#039;re using the word &quot;same&quot; quite a lot today. How many people from other developing countries are blowing up civilians to further their cause?]]></description>

I am curious as to the relationship between Lebanese Christians vs Lebanese Muslims during the Israeli wars? Was there a difference between one side siding with Israel more then the other?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;I am saying that if Mormons and Muslims completely swapped places I don&#039;t think you would see a difference in violence in the new Mormon countries.



Assertion. Also, this is assertion is quite troubling because what you are saying is that in it&#039;s essence there are no ideologies that can poison people. It&#039;s in fact something else. Were the 911 terrorist oppressed and poor?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;If there were 1.6 billion or 2.2 billion (whatever the actual numbers are) Mormons living in 

If Mayer were here, he would say the same thing he said on his show. We are dealing with the CURRENT facts on the ground. No ifs. No history. Now. 2013. And in the now, it is not the mormons or any other religion that is causing such problems but Islam.

&#062;Why did Christians go on Crusades every few years a few centuries ago? For the same reasons

		<description><![CDATA[Hey :), 
I think the argument was that even though religious extremism exists in other religions, it doesn&#039;t lead to the kind of barbaric violence we see from Islam, and not that there is no extremism in other religions in general, so it&#039;s a poinless argument.

Secondly, I almost fell off my chair when I read, &quot;If there were 1.6 billion or 2.2 billion (whatever the actual numbers are) Mormons living in developing countries, under oppressive regimes, with poor education, and little chance for freedom or financial success, I am fairly certain that you would have violent, Jihad-like Mormons.&quot;

What!!!???? Clearly, you haven&#039;t seen the show and you don&#039;t know many Mormons.  It&#039;s about some American sheltered Mormon missionaries who go to Africa where people are dying of aids, starving, babies being raped, war lords killing random people who challenge their power, etc.  Then there is a lot of really funny stuff making fun of the irrationality of Mormon theology.  In the end, they convert the people in the town and all, including the war lord, change for the good.  The point of the musical is that even if Mormonism isn&#039;t true, if it makes society more humane, its good for society.  The creators even called it their &quot;love letter to religion.&quot;

Let&#039;s now imagine a place today (please don&#039;t argue that Muslims were more moral than the barbarians in Europe a thousand years ago, or Nazis, or the North Korean Regime, because that&#039;s not saying much) where more Islam has been brought in.  Do the people change for the good or for the bad?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The truth is, I believe, that all or most holy books in extant religions reflect a much earlier period where violence was condoned in a variety of situations (wars of expansion, capital punishment for blasphemy, etc.) but the issue with Islam is that they still take the Quran literally and seriously. Almost all Jews and Christians, for example, do not practice polygamy or own slaves, even though these are both allowed by the OT/NT. But Islam, throughout most of the world, has not been modernized.


The biggest problem, that, as Maher said, makes Islam different than other religions, is that even Western Muslims have not modernized the religion to the extent that most Jews and Christians have. And I think the biggest proof of this is is the Rushdie affair, where English Muslims throughout the country condemned him to death for blasphemy, and this fatwa was supported by Muslims across the spectrum, including converts like Cat Stevens. Even if the problem isn&#039;t with the book itself, it&#039;s Muslim&#039;s continued insistence on its literal interpretation and relevance to the modern world. That&#039;s why &quot;not all religions are created equal.&quot;]]></description>
