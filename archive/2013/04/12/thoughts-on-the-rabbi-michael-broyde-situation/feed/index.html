		<description><![CDATA[I hope none of Broyde&#039;s “socks” sent out any satirical emails, because that would really be a major crime with international repercussions. For some insight on exactly how the Internet cops go after these socks in New York, see the Raphael Golb trial website: 

http://raphaelgolbtrial.wordpress.com/ 

Read the trial transcripts. See how we used taxpayer dollars to get Raphael Golb.  See how his dangerous Dead Sea socks were exposed by Manhattan prosecutors.  An odd detail, though: the prosecution was allowed to argue that Golb used his socks to make “false accusations,” but Golb was blocked from introducing any evidence that his accusations were true, because “neither good faith nor truth is a defense to the crimes charged.” Great stuff! Hopefully they will get Broyde on this too, and every other sock anyone is using out there.

And in fact, since there is actually a Herschel Goldwasser who lives in New York, maybe the authorities should have Rabbi Broyde arrested and charged with “identity theft”? After all, he used the name of another to influence a debate, thereby obtaining a “benefit.”

No, but seriously, have we all lost our minds? To remove someone from a rabbinical court for such nonsense? This says a lot more about the court than about Michael Broyde.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate your post, because it does mention the pros of Rabbi Broyde&#039;s scholarship, and the cons of his actions. His pursuit of Torah alone is an important model for people to appreciate and even admire. It was and still is exemplary. I think the difficulty now is how to sift out the rose among thorns, and truth from falsity.   However, I humbly disagree with your statement: 

&quot;On the other hand, it’s not so bad because no one was really harmed. Nothing really changed. It doesn’t really matter if he was posting things as himself or an anonymous pseudonym. It feels wrong, but no one has really been hurt here. In fact, many great rabbinic works have been written anonymously or pseudonymously.&quot;     

Once an individual falsifies his identity, it doesn&#039;t only question their credibility or personal character, it questions the motivation behind HOW they presented their material, their theological perspectives, and if the majority of their intellectual endeavours and teachings were primarily in pursuit of self aggrandizement.  Since this is suspect, there is a a LOT of harm done, countless people misled, an immense amount of publications in question, and lives turned upside down.  

When utilized correctly, we call our Torah the medicine of life, but when misused, we say it has the potential to be a deadly poison.  In addition.  Pirkei Avos Chapter 1 Verse 11:  אבטליון אומר חכחמים הזהרו בדבריכם שמא תחובו חובת גלות ותגלו מים הרעים וישתו התלמידים הבאים אחריכם וימותו ונמצא שם שמים מתחלל: 

 &quot;Avtalyon says:  scholars, be causation with your words aka teachings, perhaps you may incur the penally of exile and be banished to place of bad/evil water (implying of philosophy of heretical nature), and your students will drink from these waters and perish and (as a result) the Name of Heaven will be desecrated. &quot;

In short:  When you go astray and were previously a spiritual leader, you take others down with you.  It IS a big deal.  

I really hope everyone involved can and will heal from this challenging situation…and not be lead astray.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that perhaps one of the saddest parts of this whole saga is that a man so brilliant and talented clearly was not confident enough to believe that he could be successful without resorting to deceptive practices to strengthen his popularity.

As for his initial denial: I think that after 20 years, he actually believed Goldwasser existed and felt like he knew the guy. (See Seinfeld episode re: when you believe your own lies they are no longer lies)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the things that disturbed me about this:

There are two possible approaches to conversing with people online under a pseudonym. In either case, it involves shedding your identity, but how you choose to do so really says something about you.

My online commenting accounts are not all connected. I&#039;ve also written quite a bit online where my name doesn&#039;t appear. I&#039;ve been content with that situation. It&#039;s nice to be able to post in a vacuum.

Part of posting in a vacuum, for me at least, is that people don&#039;t read what you write with an ingrained bias. There are plenty of people who might read something I&#039;ve written with the immediate inclination to say &quot;Rand is right&quot; or &quot;Rand is wrong&quot; or &quot;Rand is a good/bad guy&quot; based on how well they know me. And I like to be read in a new light, to be judged solely on merit.

If you&#039;re a well-known Rabbi and a Law Professor, I imagine there&#039;s even more reason to do so. You want people to be able to respond to your words, not to the name on top of the post. To avoid a fallacious argument from authority. And I imagine it&#039;s a relief, to be judged by your words, not by who you are.

But Broyde took the opposite approach, one that strikes me as narcissistic in the extreme. When he went by his pseudonym he he created new accomplishments for himself in order to strengthen his position. &quot;Oh, I&#039;m a financial expert.&quot; &quot;Oh, I heard this from Rav Feinstein!&quot; &quot;Well, I&#039;m quite a bit older than you are so I have perspective on this issue.&quot; &quot;I live here, rest assured that I know more about this problem than you do!&quot;

Pretty disturbing and saddening. He&#039;s a bright and original thinker, who commands respect. Though I guess losing some of that respect is, in context, rather appropriate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This IS bad, no matter how you try and spin it. A man who writes for the purpose of influencing the public, to pretend that he has more of a public than he actually does, is just fraud. Plain and simple. So much of the pilpul involved (especially around women&#039;s issues) relies on arguments about what is &quot;common&quot; in the community or acceptable. So he has been using a big lie to try to present himself as representing &quot;the community&quot; or &quot;the mainstream&quot; when in fact some of his &quot;support&quot; is just himself. In terms of the social dynamics  of orthodox leadership, this is nothing short of a scam. Trying to turn himself into the most popular, the  most followed, the most respected, in order to give his ideas more credibility. That is all wrong, and in a way very sad. 

Of course, maybe this will be a wake-up call to the entire Jewish community that it&#039;s time to stop basing our ideas on who the most popular rabbi is, who is seen to be most &quot;mainstream&quot; and most followed, instead look to arguments and ideas based on their truth, merit and integrity. Instead of playing these little games about what is socially acceptable and popular.... the very games that tripped up Rabbi Broyde.]]></description>

However, saying things like &quot;it&#039;s not so bad because no one was really harmed&quot; is going a little too far. We are talking about a man who lied to get information that he would not hav been privy to otherwise. Then he lied by praising himself using the pseudonym. 


All this lying from a dayan and professor of law. A man that people look to for for accurate and TRUTHFUL judgments. To say no one was harmed is wrong because he has now damaged the relationship with those who look to him as a role model. I think this is a lot worse than you are making it out to be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another strange incident, is R. Broyde choosing to go after a woman who responded to his post Hirhurim post on women wearing talit describing her experience at Maimonides in the 1970s.  She,  in turn, deftly lanced R. Broyde&#039;s bizarre apologetics  as follows:  

“I’m kind of surprised that you would go to so much effort to create 6(!) different completely false back stories when the simple truth is exactly what I said. It might be more difficult for you to bend your brain about the simple truth that I wore a tallit at Maimonides with the knowledge of the Rav and without his objection.”

I disagree.
* Rabbi Broyde was harmed. His reputation is now greatly diminished.
* His followers were harmed.
* His cause was harmed.
* And his opponents will use this incident as fodder to paint everyone in, or near, his camp as lacking in integrity and lacking in good arguments (thus requiring this kind of false self-affirming commentary).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;On the other hand, it’s not so bad because no one was really harmed. &lt;/i&gt;

I am less sanguine.  First of all his apology thus far is only for the IRF issue, but he seems to maintain innocence about other posts despite the reported IP address evidence.  Second, there is the open matter of his involvement in the George Finkelstein scandal.  I fear more will still come out which could be damaging all around.

After all, his is the same R. Broyde who angrily protested on Hirhurim: &quot;Putting aside that this [Jewish Week]  op-ed neither quotes my published denial that this conversation [with Mordechai Twersky] even took place (I certainly would have remembered someone alleging that George Finklestein sexually abused them) nor my public ruling that as a matter of &lt;i&gt;halacha&lt;/i&gt; anyone with such a claim should go – run – to the police, nor that as a mere &lt;i&gt;dayan&lt;/i&gt;,I had no authority to grant or deny hearings, its basic framework of the problem and the solution is wrong.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You were quick to formulate your thoughts here. I share your high regard for Rabbi Broyde as a scholar and, generally speaking, a person. I very much wanted to learn from and with him, although my opportunities to do so were limited. To his credit, he has been extraordinarily responsive to me both via email and in phone conversations, and has offered me helpful advice personally and professionally as well. That being said, he has quite aggressively and bluntly taken me to task (privately) for my public involvement in the &quot;Maharat&quot; scandal that interfered with my RCA membership process two years ago and for my subsequent attempts to clarify what actually occurred and what I did or did not do/intend. As you recall, I spoke at Sara Hurwitz&#039;s conferral ceremony several years ago - that is literally all I did, although I was &quot;credited&quot; with much more, including not only ordaining a female rabbi but actually championing Open Orthodox ideology. Rabbi Broyde reiterated to me, as recently as this past weekend, that my explanation that I was naive, trusting and didn&#039;t fully appreciate the political implications of agreeing to participate in that controversial event failed to pass what he called the &quot;giggle test&quot;, was not credible and that, because of my perceived lack of credibility, I &quot;have no friends&quot; in the Orthodox world. I&#039;m curious how he would apply that principle to his own case.]]></description>
