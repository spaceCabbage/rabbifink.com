		<description><![CDATA[Below is an amazing and insightful article on Lag B&#039;Omer 
The article is Compiled by Rabbi Moishe Dovid Lebovits 
Reviewed by Rabbi Benzion Schiffenbauer Shlita
All Piskei Harav Yisroel Belsky Shlita are reviewed by Harav Yisroel Belsky Shlita

Link: http://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/halacha/Issue5.pdf

It is a very thorough and lengthy read so I took the liberty of quoting all of the sources that fall under your claim that Lag B&#039;Omer is not mentioned as something significate if at all between the Talmud and the early Achronim ie: Rema: 

Talmud Yevamos 62b, Meseches Shabbos 33b, Bereishis Rabbah 79:6, Koheles Rabbah,  10:8 Tur O.C. 428, Shulchan Aruch O.C. 428:1, Darchei Moshe 493:1, Rama 2

There sources all fit your window. If we are allowed to quote Achronim, then the Gra, Mishneh Berurah, Aruch HaShulchan, Alter Rebbe, Levush, Pri Megadim all mention Lag B&#039;Omer and its importance as a day of simcha.

The song &quot;Bar Yochai&quot; was also written in the 1500&#039;s so by your standards a &quot;few hundred&quot; years comes out to around 500.

Chasam Sofer says that the Mon fell that day

Chayei Adom also mentions Lag B&#039;Omer

No Tachunun on Lag B&#039;Omer - Darchei Moshe 493:3, Rama 131:6 in addition to many other sources

Arizal says to cut a childs hair in meron for Lag B&#039;Omer 

“Chai Rotel.” (The &quot;holy water&quot;) The Bobov Rebbe zt”l said that 
one who gives out this mashka on Lag B’omer is zocheh to great things including children.

Aruch Hashulchan mentions bon fires

Side Note: HaRav Yisroel Belsky speaks highly of all the customs that you critique in this 
article.

I to appreciate sources for customs, but Judaism is not a stagnant nor ancient religion. It is living a breathing like the Jews who practice it. We do not live Torah life the way of Chazal (as yesterdays Daf Yomi about Eruvim (I dont do daf but overheard it in shul) reminds us.) There are many customs and even halachos that are only a few hundred years old yet we as klal yisroel have added these stringencies. 

There is a holiday where people make pilgrimage to a tomb, like Calev did to pray to the Avos. The light bonfires because fire is a significant part of simcha as we see from our Shabbos Candles and Chanukah Menorah. We dance around the fires, or next to it in Joy, we give money for water because well people get thirsty. We sing songs about great man like Torah Tziva Lanue Moshe, or Dovid Melech Yisrael Chai Chai V&#039;Chayim, we cut hair to celebrate a birthday as a boy is compared to a tree. Lag B&#039;Omer synthesis quite well between many other &quot;traditional&quot; holidays in Judaism. Sounds beautiful. Its a shame I am late as its Yud Sivan]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;I coined a new name for this holiday – “International Jewish Mysticism Day.”&lt;/i&gt;


I would like to propose an alternate name:  Chadash Assur Min HaTorah Day.


I think it just has so much more nuance.  It reflects the original contextual mean of Chadash that we&#039;re supposed to be counting the days until Chadash becomes Yasahan after the Karban Omer, a concept that has largely been relegated to esoterica in the Diaspora.  It&#039;s evidence that the halachic system evolves and allows for changes toward leniency when needed.  Lag BaOmer itself, as a day of any significance, along with the accompanying mourning period is itself a time honored innovation.   It&#039;s evidence that the Chasam Sofer novella is wrong.  The even more recent RaShbY centric customs are further evidence that innovation is embraced by all sorts when it speaks to them.   It&#039;s evidence that even that which may be shtus, and rooted in chukot hagoyim is sometime incorporated and that just because the innovator is wearing a streimel doesn&#039;t make it correct.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The desire for idol worship still exists.

Only now, it puts on fancy Charedi looking clothes, and berates anyone who doesn&#039;t believe that the Zohar was given on Mount Sinai.

Somehow, I still feel that the cults of Shimon Bar Yochai, Nachman ben Faiga, and Menachem Mendel ben Chana, can offer something of value to the spiritually unaffiliated Jew.

Since it&#039;s almost idol worship, but not quite, I would think that joining one of these groups - and gaining shabbat, kashrut, and many other mitzvot as a side effect - is still on balance a net positive for the average Jew that had no understanding of those mitzvot before getting recruited.

We must remain vigilant against even pseudo idol worship, while continuing to love each and every Jew, even those that stray into this halachic gray area.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;If anyone starts to think that R’ Shimon bar Yochai is praying on their behalf, that could be idol worship.&quot; 


Asking a decesed Tzadik (at his grave) to pray to Gd for ones wellbeing is not idolatry as per:

Talmud Sota 34b, Rashi Bamidbar 13:22, Ba&quot;ch Yorah Deah 217, Sa&quot;ch Yorah Deah 179 amongst others.

From more on this see: http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5760/shlach.html (Thanks rabbi Fink for the link).

So the question remains (after an unanswered twitter discussion with Rabbi Fink), what are your basing that statement (accusation?) on?]]></description>

in the US, you’re right.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; If I would tell you that there is a holiday where people make a pilgrimage to a tomb,
light bonfires, dance around the fires, …

Years ago, when I was in high school, I went to one of the local shul’s Lag B’Omer bonfire with some friends. I remember watching the firemen (who were there as a safety precaution) watching the men dancing slowly around a big bonfire while chanting and wondering what the (non-Jewish) firemen must be thinking.

&#062; And it makes sense that it doesn’t sound familiar to the Jewish ear, because it is a new
holiday which was certainly influenced by outside factors.

As opposed to the old holidays which were certainly influenced by outside factors? :)]]></description>
