		<description><![CDATA[Again, I point to the evidence at hand.

How often do any of these WoW leaders pray in a group, outside of the kotel?

How often will you find a Meretz MK attending shabbat services, of any type?

I have seen women several times at the kotel, wearing talit and tefilin, walking into the women&#039;s section.

No one bothered them.  No one called the cops.

Why?

Those women really came to pray.

They didn&#039;t come with politicians and video cameras, to make a point, and drum up donations from liberal American Jews.  

They didn&#039;t give interviews or write blog posts about changing the will of the Israeli people, changing the character of the kotel, changing the religious character of the entire country.

They just wanted to pray, in a manner in which they were comfortable.

That&#039;s the difference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. I&#039;m not sure if this is egalitarian. I think they are all women.
2. It wouldn&#039;t be a minyan, it would be a group of women. A minyan is 10 MEN!
3. I&#039;m not aware of any halacha that prevent women from getting together to daven (with or without tallis, tefillin, sefer Torah, etc).


So which orthodox Jewish ideal does this conflict with?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Funny how a group called &quot;Women of the Wall&quot; only manages to show up to the kotel once a month - and they bring extreme left wing politicians and video cameras along. 


What about the real women of the wall?  What about the women who pray at the kotel daily?  The Knesset and the Supreme Court have designated the kotel as an Orthodox synagogue.  The real women of the wall come there to pray, and respect the norms that the Israeli people have chosen to establish there.


The halachic details of women wearing tallit, tefillin, or reading from the Torah are moot.  These Gd haters are coming to a place where prayer is conducted in one manner, and intentionally disturbing the peace, to fulfill a political agenda.


I do agree that Sharansky is a hero.  Give them open access to Robinson&#039;s Arch, and take away the false pretense of &quot;we just want to pray&quot;.]]></description>

Finally, when we meet on the inside of the kosel do you believe that mashiach will allocate a spot for their services?

		<description><![CDATA[I doubt that you will see any protest over this plan.

non-frum services have been going on at Robinson&#039;s Arch for awhile now. 

I&#039;ve never heard of any protests over it.

The only thing is, until now, they had to pay to enter the site (as it&#039;s part of an archaeological park) and could only use it during the hours that the park was open.

So, they&#039;ll take down a fence, build out a platform, whatever, and make it part of the 24 / 7 kotel plaza.  No big deal.  

If anything, the Israeli religious population will be relieved; the Gd hating leftists will no longer have an excuse to disturb the peace at the existing kotel prayer area.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would imagine that for a while they will since the existing Kotel plaza is the image that we all have in our heads of what it means to visit the Kotel, -  but not necessarily first.  A USY led trip would probably go to the new portion for prayer, where they can participate in a service in accordance to their values, and visit the original plaza as a tourist site.   An trip without any affiliation will probably give their participants the option of choosing to go where they are comfortable.  



If it&#039;s any solace, I think everyone will still &quot;see&quot; the original plaza as a tourist stop by itself (perhaps to see chareidim, as a curiosity, the way people go to Lancaster PA to see Amish), or on the way to a kotel tunnel tour, or going up to the Temple, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[She was arrested for of the offense of wearing a tallit, any tallit.  They only have enforced the law against women who where the traditional tallitot associate in Orthodoxy with men.   (i.e. A women wearing a pink frilly tallit is left alone)

If only the Kotel leadership was more diverse, it could have seen fit to rely on the Rambam who likely never saw a &quot;feminine&quot; tallit in his life and wrote this:

&quot;Women... who wish to wear tzitzit may do so without a blessing Similarly, all other positive commandments from which women are exempt, if they wish to perform them they do so without a 
blessing, and they are not condemned.&quot;


But, that&#039;s too rational for the zealots in charge.  Perhaps, a more rational policy would have gone unchallenged, and for those who value keeping the Kotel area (oddly even the portions most never think of as the Kotel) as place where traditional prayer is the only form heard.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sounds good to me.


I just hope high school and Birthright trips still go to the existing kotel plaza as well.


Part of the experience of visiting the kotel for the first time is to see and hear the type of tefilah that many of these trip participants have never experienced before.]]></description>
