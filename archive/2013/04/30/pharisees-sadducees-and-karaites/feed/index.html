		<description><![CDATA[The Sadducees and Beithosians -- if there was even any distinction between the two - never considered their body of interpretation and traditions+customs to have been delivered to them Divinely, which in turn means they can not be considered an oral law.
Moreover, the Sadducees never claimed that they developed their interpretations and traditions through prophesy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After reading your interesting post, I noticed a Maharatz Chayus (sorry Rebbetzen David if I spelled his name incorrectly;)) who discusses this dilemma, and actually seems to be questioning the Ramba&quot;m on this as well. He brings some marei mekomos that should probably be further investigated by you, or anyone who really wants to clarify this topic.
The Maharatz Chayus is in the Vilna Shas at the end of Avos, in the section titled &quot;hagahos vechidushim lepairush hamisnah al meseches avos&quot;, in the first piece.

I do think it&#039;s important to realize that as far as I can tell, all of ancient history is subjective. No one recorded &quot;History&quot; or &quot;Current events&quot; in those days for any reason other than to promote their own position and agenda. So, to say &quot;I would prefer precision for the sake of accuracy and truth&quot; is probably more than wishful thinking. We can&#039;t even get precision as to what happened in Benghazi, imagine going back two thousand plus years!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would be hesitant to call the Rambam clumsy here, since he is notable for exact use of words.  It could be that while there are many differences, the fact that they don&#039;t accept the complete Rabbinic tradition leaves them &quot;the same&quot;, outside nortmative tradition.  That said, it does make sense that the Tzedukim were closer to the Perushim than we generally think, this is why they were considered a threat. Had they been more like reform, the Perushim likely would not have to have taken them seriously.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For one thing, I don&#039;t know of any group extant today, calling itself the Sadducees.

However, there are (depending on how you count and who you believe) between 20-50 thousand Karaites still around today.

They even started allowing Gentiles to convert to join Karaite communites, a few years ago.

Whereas the Samaritans (Cutim) are a historical oddity, with a handful of families left, the present day Karaites are vibrant, and growing.

The difference is, the Karaites (at least for now) do not seek to challenge Orthodox Judaism.

Karaites regard Orthodox Jews as their brethren.  On basic theological and moral issues, I agree much more with my Karaite friends, than with my Reform friends.

Karaites have their own religious authority in Israel.  They are not part of the Rabbanut, but they have independent authority to perform weddings, funerals, and other rites, according to their traditions.

If Reform truly wanted &quot;religious freedom&quot; in Israel, they would do exactly what the Karaites have done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062; They both started with rejecting the Oral Law,
By the Oral law, I take it you obviously mean our mishna,Talmud and subsequent halakhah. But this is simply not true for the Sadducees. They could not have rejected something that was only in the making, as they preceded mishna and Talmud by centuries.. I know you believe that the Oral Law goes back to Sinai, but if we are seeking truth, we must accept that this belief is at best a bit exaggerated, and at worst not true. As the Dead sea scrolls show, undeniably, that every sect had its own oral law. and who is to say which was the most &quot;authentic&quot;

&#062;&#062;&#062;&#062;  ... the Sadducees developed theirs by prophetic inspiration

and how do you think many of the Israelites received their “law” during the first mikdosh if not from the Nevi-im.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you want to compare the Karaite with Sadducee halacha, good starting points would be R&#039; Revel&#039;s &quot;The Karaite Halacha&quot;, and the writings of Aharon Shemesh - he has a short book in English, and a longer book in Hebrew on what the DSS tell us about the Sadducees and their approach to Halacha.
