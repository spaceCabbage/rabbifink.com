		<description><![CDATA[It absolutely boggles my mind that any shomer(et) mitzvot can learn parshat shlach, and not at least start trying, planning, for aliyah.

There are valid exemptions for aliyah, just as there are valid exemptions for men not wearing tefillin this morning.  

Unfortunately, in both cases, the vast majority that fail to fulfill the positive commandment do not have a valid exemption.

More tragically, while no shomer mitzvot would ever consider missing a day of tefillin wearing, plenty of shomrei mitzvot obtusely ignore the mitzvah of yishuv haaretz; having been led astray by their chu&quot;l communities with the logic &quot;Everyone else is doing it&quot; (living in chu&quot;l).

&lt;i&gt; We must take the lesson of the spies and use the right glasses to see things the right way. &lt;/i&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I think this is a great explanation as to why some people make aliyah and some don&#039;t - or simply won&#039;t.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;  This is because the Peh, which can also refer to the mouth, jumped ahead of the Ayin, which can also refer to the eye.

Or because Peh used to come before Ayin in the Aleph Beis, and at some point they switched.

I like your conclusion, though, despite the introduction being one of those vorts that tries to explain a difficulty that disappears when you approach it academically.]]></description>
