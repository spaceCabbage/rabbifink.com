		<description><![CDATA[if there is abuse allegations made by a third party and substantiated , the child will typically be taken away regardless of whether or not there is any custody proceedings or anything else pending. Anytime a child is in imminent danger, the authorities need to protect the kid. I mention third party as a spouse filing an accusation during custody proceedings aren&#039;t taken as seriously (if substantiated - it would be the same result).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[you are right. that is one disturbing aspect. if both parents love their child, is more or less equally involved and responsible - the religion can tip the scale. For the religion to be more important makes no sense. Kids move all the time. Kids can adjust from religions and many other things. Getting abused, not being loved and lack of patience with the children are far worst for the kids. Being religious or irreligious is not necessarily in the best interest of the child. Getting abused is always against the child&#039;s best interest. To put this another way, had this gone to Bet Din and the Bet Din had issued the same ruling, no court would have upheld it. Bet Din arbitration is legally enforceable but court will reject an arbitration for child care that is clearly not in the child&#039;s best interest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[just joining now as I&#039;m chatting a bit with Kelly. Typically, parents decide what is best for their children. Court doesn&#039;t decide if moving from NY to CA is good for the kids. However, in a  custody situation, judge has to decide best interest of child. What is disturbing about the Myzner case is the Judge getting involved in the minutae. Judge said that TV, internet and her style of dress in front of the children is against hasidic judaism. Is she a rabbi? Those are hotly debated issues. Many mothers dress in pants in front of the kids. Many hasidim sell on amazon and therefore have internet at home. Many hasids sneak a TV in with the TV box. I went to yeshiva. You were prohibited from having a TV at home. Many parents had a tv but trained kids to keep it quiet. My grandfather was the principal of a black hat yeshiva. He knew that most of his kids had tv in their houses as long as it was in the bedroom and not the living room. There is a well established wall between church and state. Judge has a right to order the mother to keep kid in a hasidic school and keep the practices. But judge has no right spelling them out. That crosses the line.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Who&#039;s talking about halacha? We&#039;re talking about what rabbis do.

On the one hand they&#039;ll be mekarev a couple and one partner will become frum while the other doesn&#039;t; no rabbi will tell them to get divorced. On the other hand you&#039;ll have a frum couple where one partner leaves frumkeit - without feeding the other one traif - and the rabbis will advise that they get divorced.

Now, before you accuse me of making this up; see this recent notice put out by Rabbi Yaakov Horowitz who is attempting to address this issue.

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry Shragi.  As I wrote previously, I didn&#039;t know what you meant originally.  I was guessing based on other comments.


As to &quot;the issue at hand&quot; - it really depends on what &quot;leaving frumkeit&quot; means.


If one spouse goes out and breaks shabbos, eats treif, or engages in other private violations (other than infidelity), there is no halachic requirement that the couple get divorced.


If one spouse intentionally serves treif food to the other, without stipulating that the food isn&#039;t kosher - or If a wife refuses to keep taharas mishpacha - in those instances, one spouses &quot;leaving frumkeit&quot; necessarily infringes on the other spouses&#039; ability to keep mitzvot.


Only in the latter cases is divorce an absolute requirement.


Someone please fill in the citation of the Talmudic sage who said something like &quot;It&#039;s enough that she raises my children and keeps me from sin&quot;]]></description>

Now, you didn&#039;t address the inconsistency at all. You draid a kup with some lomdus about why a secular couple&#039;s marriage is not k&#039;halalcha and why their kids aren&#039;t mamzerim.
The issue at hand is why a rabbi won&#039;t go telling a couple where one spouse is becoming frum that they should get divorced, while they do do that to frum couples where one spouse is leaving frumkeit.]]></description>

When two shomrei mitzvot stand under the chuppah, the marriage is explicitly stated to conditionally exist &quot;k&#039;daas moshe v&#039;yisrael&quot;  (according to the law / knowledge / religion of Moses and Israel)

Once either spouse no longer wants to live under daas moshe v&#039;yisrael, that spouse is violation the explicit condition of the marriage.

Now; many Jews who are not shomrei mitzvot will say the same sentence at their weddings.  However, if their actions immediately thereafter are shown to be in contradistinction to daas moshe v&#039;yisrael, such that it can be reasonably inferred that they never really intended to govern their marriage as such - the marriage is null and void.

(With observant couples, they DID intend to govern their marriage k&#039;daas moshe v&#039;yisrael at the time.  Unfortunately, subsequent refusal to do so does not automatically end the marriage, although I wish that this were the case).

R&#039; Moshe Feinstein most famously ruled this way, to avoid classifying children of Jewish second marriages as mamzerim.

At a secular wedding (AFAIK), there is no explicit commitment made to stay secular, devoid of all religious practice.

That&#039;s the difference.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And to address some side issues raised in comments and in your other post, in Massachusetts judges are appointed and orthodox Jews are a wholly insignificant voting bloc.  And I don&#039;t see how your idea of &quot;all other things being equal the mother gets custody&quot; could stand an equal protection challenge.


Neither parents nor the Chassidic community, nor the ex-Chassidic community, nor the state have any &quot;rights&quot; to the child.  The child is a human being, after all. The parents have obligations to the child, at least one of which, in my opinion, at least one parent failed to meet when they went through an acrimonious divorce.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These cases are always very hard.  A number (long enough that I still got newspapers in hard copy) of years ago, I awoke to find the divorce case of a woman we knew slightly on the front page of the Boston Globe, as it had been decided by the state&#039;s highest court.  In this case, mom was Jewish, dad wasn&#039;t and both had become more religious both through the marriage and in the course of the divorce.  The case at hand was not a custody battle, but whether the father would be permitted to take the kids to church when they were with him.  The court ruled no, arguing that it was not in the best interest of the children, (which is the legal standard) and that it was in the best interest of the children to continue be raised Jewish, as the couple had originally begun.   My sense is in general if the judge can&#039;t see how the two parents&#039; lifestyles can be combined in a way that doesn&#039;t leave the kids&#039; heads spinning, the parent who is making the more drastic change tends to lose out.

I think the notion of an &quot;implied contract&quot; is not really what wins, as the standard is almost always &quot;best interest of the child&quot;, but that continuity with how the child has been raised before the divorce carries a lot of weight as the divorce is a traumatic enough change without adding major changes in religion, type of education etc.

I have no idea how a judge is supposed to decide what is in the best interest of the child in the case of two divorcing parents of equal capability who are moving toward dramatically different lifestyles, whether that is religiously motivated or for other reasons.   You kind of end up with a heart wrenching problem no matter what you decide.  I can see the appeal of continuity as a major factor.]]></description>

If they don&#039;t and if the parents can&#039;t agree on who should have primary custody the judge must award it to one of the parents.  The other can   be awarded very liberal visitation.

		<description><![CDATA[No, she&#039;s saying that switching religious orientation is bad for young kids.  If she has any integrity she would rule the same way if the mother were a non-religious person becoming Orthodox in her new life.

Considering that  the judge is openly gay, I doubt she&#039;s a Bible-thumping fundamentalist. However, considering that her bench may have been &quot;bought&quot; with questionable ultra-Orthodox fundraising, she may have a conflict of interest.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Further, the court seemed to have been much more amenable to joint custody solutions if the mother would have committed to even the slightest observance. &quot;



In this case, was the mother unwilling to commit to any level of observance when the kids were around?  How do these arrangements usually work when one parent is OTD?  I thought usually there is some agreement that the home will be kosher for the kids&#039; sake, that the kids will have to go to a yeshiva, or something like that.


If the mother was totally unwilling to bend on these issues I can understand the ruling somewhat more.  Or was it that she was unwilling to run her household like a Satmar chassid?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What I don&#039;t understand is how could the judge rule to put the children in foster care?  Living with strangers has got to be much more confusing and discontinuous for the kids than being with their own parent, no matter how flawed.  I would have thought that in custody cases where neither parent is ideal, the judge will choose the less flawed of two options.  Since the father is being accused of abuse, that would naturally be the mother.  How on earth did this judge find that being in the foster care system would be better than placing the children with the mother who is the better of the two parents?!?  Child protective services do everything they can to avoid that and will work with a natural parent to provide parenting classes and counseling so that the children can remain at home.  This custody arrangement makes no sense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This comes up often in the context of a spouse who wants to leave Orthodoxy, even if the marriage is intact.  It&#039;s often implied that there was an implicit contract at the time of marriage that both spouses would remain Orthodox.  This argument is undermined by the experiences of married baalai tshuva.  (I know of at least one couple in which one spouse wanted to become Orthodox, while the other emphatically did not).  You would never hear a kiruv rabbi arguing that since the couple was staunchly secular at the time of marriage, that there was an implied contract that they remain secular.  You might hear the kiruv rabbi say &quot;take it slow&quot; or &quot;wait for your husband to catch up in his observance&quot;, but never to abandon the &quot;tshuva&quot; process. While I certainly understand that the religious honestly believe observance is the &quot;right&quot; way to live, it&#039;s an annoying double standard.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, Shulem, I couldn&#039;t have said it better. 

The frum community is trying to stem the tide of people leaving, and is therefore circling the wagons to keep outside influences out as well as keep the insiders in. 

But such harsh tactics will only backfire and result in even more alienating people such as myself, who have stopped believing in that system a while ago and are only there because of the hardships that leaving entails. I see the pain and suffering this extremist cult causes its members, both those willingly submitting to it and those trying to escape it, and I refuse to have any part of such a community. As much as this community tries to portray that דרכיה דרכי נועם, such actions only reveal its true ugly face.

My reaction to this is to make sure I do whatever it is in my power to untangle myself from this crazy community&#039;s grip. It only causes me to feel hatred and anger to those perpetrating and engineering such vile and cruel strategies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good thoughts, R&#039; Eliyahu, as always.

However, this needs to be said: Without taking into account various &quot;environmental&quot; factors, you haven&#039;t really understood the case. Context really does matter. 

The fact is, the judge is answerable to her political constituents alone (Rockland County voters elect family court judges) and Chasidim are a force to be reckoned with, with very specific needs and interests. That *has* to be a factor. 

Also, the fact that the Chasidic community hounded Ms. Myzner while the case was ongoing (the security cameras, phone threats, etc.) says something about their tactics. (We know this happens to OTD parents in general. And in this case, I have seen photos of the security cameras installed inside the neighbor&#039;s window.)

The hiring of the super-lawyer, paid for by the community. 

The automatic assumption that an OTD person is suffering from psychological issues (and is therefore of course an unfit parent). 

The generally cruel attitudes towards OTD parents--you wouldn&#039;t believe the horror stories that keep coming, week after week, month after month.

When you take all this into account, I think there&#039;s a seriously different picture. Is it all provable? Some of it is, some of it isn&#039;t. But even what isn&#039;t provable, most of us know that these patterns exist, and so it isn&#039;t a stretch. 



Are you going to find it within the text of the court decision? You just might, if you know where to look.]]></description>
