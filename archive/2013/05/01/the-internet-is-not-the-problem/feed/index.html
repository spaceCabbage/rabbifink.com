		<description><![CDATA[I think we&#039;re at loggerheads.  I just wish I could understand your position.  It would help me be more judgmental of others.  ;)  

There&#039;s no need for that type of consistency.  If you say scientists are always wrong then it would unethical (or whatever you want to call it) to bring in a scientist.  But if you say they are fallible and the scientists who disagree with the tora have their own scientists detractors, I can;&#039;t see how that&#039;s a problem,.

So too here.  If you can find these guys saying goyim are always wrong by dint of being goyim.  Fine, you&#039;re right.  But if they they say goyim are sometimes right and sometimes wrong, and look here, even mainstream goyische Internet publications agree the Internet is disruptive to human life (although they have different takeaways from it), why is that wrong?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nu? So as I said above, they believe they&#039;re correct on their own merits, they don&#039;t need anyone else to agree with them. 

Once they start pointing to the fact that others agree with them in order to support their position they find themselves in an untenable situation very quickly. I&#039;m not impressed with the fact that the NYT or Paul Miller from The Verge agree that there are problems with the internet, you and and I also agree that there are problems with the internet. But to quote them and stop halfway through? To me that&#039;s inconsistent. 

It&#039;s like when kiruv people make fun of science, they say it&#039;s not always correct, scientists have agendas etc. but then they whip out some scientist who does agree with them. Aryeh Kaplan dismissed all archeology as pseudo-science, and he was consistent in his application; he never quotes an archeological find that supports his position.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a pick and choose game for everyone.  I don&#039;t have to accept everything a pundit says just because I agree with one thing he says.  I think, oddly enough, you&#039;re projecting some kind of da&#039;at tora to the NYT.  this is the kind of thing you hear about rabanim--you can&#039;t pick and choose which t&#039;shvot you want to listen to.  There may be something to that from a halakha perspective.  But it&#039;s nonsense when it comes to analytical thinking.  There are good ideas and bad ideas.  You analyze each on its own, but its perfectly legitimate to find someone who agrees with you even if you admit you don&#039;t agree on much else.  &quot;goyim&quot; aren&#039;t some kind of mass hive-mind.  Even a single goy has many different opinions that you may or may not agree with, just like a Jew does.  With the NYT it was an a fortiori argument (that&#039;s kal v&#039;khomer for you non-lawyers).  Even they think it&#039;s a problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Come on.  Listen--I think the asifa was stupid and I&#039;m disappointed my rav went to it.  I recognize the dangers of the Internet (I have them), but don&#039;t see that the asifa provided any solutions, or that it possibly could have (making the whole thing ludicrous).  I say this so you know my point of view.  But that&#039;s fallacious to say that I can&#039;t point to other people who have good ideas and say that I&#039;m not alone.  Like I might say, even Christopher Hitchens thought that Western Civilization was worth fighting for against the Muslims.  Now you can give me 99% of Hitchens&#039;s other ideas and their complete twaddle.  But I&#039;ll certainly use him if he supports me, and I do so non-hypocritically.  I know I don&#039;t ordinarily agree with him.  Just ion this instance we agree (even if we may disagree on how to fight the Muslims).  I&#039;m trying to use a concrete example I came up with on the fly, but I can use general terms if you prefer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Because they&#039;re being inconsistent in their application of using non-Jews as an example.
If they think justice or morality is on their side, which they do, they shouldn&#039;t need to point out that &quot;even those non-Jews (who are generally wrong) agree with us&quot; because if they&#039;re pointing to non-Jews as proof, I can point to non-Jews for proof of other things, things that the organizers of the Asifa don&#039;t agree with, and what would their response be then?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hear that all problems can&#039;t be blamed on the internet. But are we not obligated as Jews to take away stumbling blocks that stand in our way of full service of G-d? I hear that spending that kind of money and time on an asifa that makes the internet it&#039;s showpiece was unfortunately a waste. It had so much potential. However, to get back to the internet:
Take you, for instance. The reputation you have is one of a rebel, of a person who tries to stir up trouble and write against the general frum world. Yes, of course there are problems. But say we did a study and found out how much you have actually influenced or changed. Would it be worth it? What kind of person would you be if you used all of your time blogging and facebooking actually learning and teaching and discussing Torah with live people? Doing acts of chesed and Mitzvos?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;As my head uncluttered, my attention span expanded. In my first month or two, 10 pages of The Odyssey was a slog. Now I can read 100 pages in a sitting, or, if the prose is easy and I&#039;m really enthralled, a few hundred.

I learned to appreciate an idea that can&#039;t be summed up in a blog post, but instead needs a novel-length exposition. By pulling away from the echo chamber of internet culture, I found my ideas branching out in new directions. I felt different, and a little eccentric, and I liked it.

Without the retreat of a smartphone, I was forced to come out of my shell in difficult social situations. Without constant distraction, I found I was more aware of others in the moment. I couldn&#039;t have all my interactions on Twitter anymore; I had to find them in real life. My sister, who has dealt with the frustration of trying to talk to me while I&#039;m half listening, half computing for her entire life, loves the way I talk to her now. She says I&#039;m less detached emotionally, more concerned with her well-being — less of a jerk, basically.&quot;



How can you read that and not be scared for your children to grow up on the internet?]]></description>

The internet is a problem if it is causing trouble related only to the internet. It&#039;s no different then the trouble caused by your car, mortgage, or anything else. Each thing has it&#039;s own sets of problems.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Paul Miller mentions this &quot;friend&quot; he made outside the Internet Asifa who was really excited to see him there and saw him as an ally; I wonder what that friend would say about him now?


More broadly I had this criticism of the Internet Asifa before it took place; I had seed (and I so badly regret that I didn&#039;t keep) a pamphlet put out by the Igud which quoted, in full, an op-ed from a NYT editor who was lamenting the fact that his kids don&#039;t have the attention span to read full-length books because they&#039;re so used to reading status updates. They can&#039;t have it both ways, yes the an editor at the New York Times was complaining about this phenomenon but his solution wasn&#039;t to ban the internet. They can&#039;t selectively pick from non-Hareidi sources to bolster their arguments, or they can and they&#039;ll be inconsistent.]]></description>
