		<description><![CDATA[Your parallels to doctors and lawyers are weak. What if your doctor reads medical journals but is not familiar with medieval medical practices?  Is she then a quack? What if your lawyer writes the best damn contracts but has no familiarity with comparative law journals and knows nothing of land use and zoning? Makes him worthless to you and the bar? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When did you become the authority in what&#039;s needed to be a Rav?

Who needs to be an authority?  I think, that someone who knows more Jewish stuff than the average non-Rav is a common sense criteria.  Since most of the relevant subject matter on this topic written in the past 100 years has been written in academic Hebrew (although some important things have been written in academic English as well), then I indeed expect that from a Rav.  The fact that other rabbis are also not up to par is just extending the indictment to a broader sphere.  There is no issue of embarrassment.  The rabbi runs a blog for self-promotion.  Once someone puts themselves in the public sphere, then they open themselves up to criticism.  I don&#039;t accept your contention that somehow he should be spared criticism just because it may make him feel bad.  I would never say this about someone who is just an individual.  But the person running this blog is promoting themselves as a rabbi and writing as an authority, and if he is not qualified, then he should be called on it.  There is no sin involved.]]></description>

A Rabbi does in fact not need to know modern academic Hebrew. You can say differently and you would be very wrong.
It&#039;s gaava to feel you know a person and can invalidate their profession based on your own superficial, erroneous opinion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What is extreme about expecting a rabbi to know Hebrew?!?!


And dan leKaf zechut is totally out of place here.  What am I supposed to say to a rabbi who admits they don&#039;t have the Hebrew skills to read a book?  Should I hold their hand and say &quot;there, there&quot; its ok to be ignorant.  Knowing stuff is way overrated anyway.  I am not the one who is embarrassing him.  I did not reveal to the world that he has no Hebrew skills, he did that himself.   Is one supposed to let ignorant people rant on the internet without calling them out on their ignorace?  This is a blog for goodness sakes!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all he didn&#039;t say he doesn&#039;t know Hebrew. Native English speakers have trouble reading academic journals as well. The good Rabbi can learn seforim. Why do you feel the right to pasul and embarrass someone because he doesn&#039;t feel comfortable reading a very specific type of writing that I suspect many, many Rabbis would feel uncomfortable reading in English. 
When did you become the authority in what&#039;s needed to be a Rav? Again, even if you were right, you are still sinning. If you cared about the Rav you would&#039;ve contacted him privately. All you seem to be doing is trying to prop yourself up with some self-righteous indignity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So build the skills!  Is it appropriate that a Rabbi should not be able to access materials that any Israeli with a high school matriculation can read?!  You do realize that much of the most important work on rabbinics in the past 100 years is written in Hebrew and has never been translated.  Right?


If there is a book you are interested in that comes out and you have to wait for a translation, then you do not have the basic competency to intellectually engage with the very subject matter that your title suggests you have.  I am not a rabbi and should not be able to engage rabbinics at a higher level than a self proclaimed rabbi.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Loved this book as well. Assaf&#039;s studied objectivity is a feat that last throughout each study. You should also check out his other (translated) book, &quot;The Regal Way&quot;, about the House of Rizhin (its something like 70$ online, so if you&#039;re like me, you&#039;ll probably want a library copy). Its more academic and less accessible than Ne&#039;haz be-Sevah, but just as cool. 


Also BTW, you can download and print a relatively readable version of the once-published (i think) Pirush Ma&quot;n on Avot by the Itscaner. I have it sitting on the shelf next to me as I write this - feels like I&#039;m just a little closer to what I think of an ideal Rebbe.]]></description>
