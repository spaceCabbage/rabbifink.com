		<description><![CDATA[I never thought I’d be quoting Hamodia to make a point about the history of halacha, but accept the truth from whatever its source:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the ideal structure of society, when life is lived the way the Torah wishes it to be, a wife is totally and completely cared for by her husband, and he in turn, would not neglect in any way or fashion all his marital duties and his obligations to his wife. Furthermore, the Torah&#039;s permission to divorce his wife, even against her will, was meant to be applied only in extraordinary circumstances, when there is no other viable option. However, the fabric of society decayed over the generations, and when Rabbeinu Gershom realized that these privileges were being abused by unscrupulous individuals, he saw it necessary to address both issues and enact decrees to combat these abuses.

First, he issued a cherem (decree of excommunication) against any man who divorced his wife against her will. This alone was, of course, insufficient as long as polygamy was permitted, as the result would be that the husband who could no longer give his wife a get against her will would simply marry another woman instead.

Accordingly, Rabbeinu Gershom also issued a cherem against any man who married more than one wife. What this meant in practical terms was that a husband was now on equal footing with his wife when it came to divorce. Neither could end the marriage unilaterally, and neither could remarry without a get. But there were new problems that arose as a result of the cherem of Rabbeinu Gershom. Where a wife was unable to accept a get, because, for example, she lacked the mental capacity to accept a get or because she had disappeared, the husband was now without recourse. Whereas before the cherem he could remarry, doing so now would be in violation of the cherem’s prohibition of polygamy. Accordingly, the cherem did not to apply in situations where a beis din permitted the husband to remarry pursuant to a heter meah Rabbanim.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this case, whatever the rationale for why the halachos of gitin are set up the way they are doesn&#039;t matter; there are ways to mitigate the potential negative consequences of those halachos, such as signing a halachic pre-nuptial agreement.

		<description><![CDATA[While it&#039;s prohibited to cause emotional or physical pain to others, there are situations that cause intractable pain to both parties.  The husband will suffer pain from a custodial arrangement which favors his wife.  There is no legalistic King Solomon to adjudicate whose pain is worse.  Same for being kind to the underprivileged.  Gital  doesn&#039;t appear to be underprivileged (law degree, supportive parents) except in the lack of the privilege to end her marriage, which you acknowledge is unchangeable.
I have massive sympathy for Gital, but to remain part of the community she has to follow a bunch of rules, which she has (understandably) chosen to do.  The rules suck.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like your perspective, and I&#039;d like to even add to it a little.  We can even glean from the Torah&#039;s description of divorce (or similar) proceedings how a person is supposed to act.  Take, for instance, the Torah&#039;s description of how to treat the girl sold into slavery. If her owner decides to betrothe her, but subsequently loses favor, he is not allowed to simply dispose of her.  He can&#039;t just sell her.  Even in sending her away, he must treat her well.  Or if he decides to marry her to his son, but his son doesn&#039;t want her, he MUST act as a true husband to her.  And if he doesn&#039;t, she goes free.  That&#039;s a powerful idea, I think: if the man can&#039;t be a true husband to her, he must set her free.  Yes, this is discussed in a monetary context, but even more so when discussing women who entered the marriage freely and not as slaves!  The idea itself resonates: a man can&#039;t hold his no-longer-truly-a-wife hostage; he must let her free.  As you said: it is true that the Torah granted the man the mechanism to end the marriage solely in his hands; that does not necessarily mean, however, it granted him the right to use it as leverage or as a weapon.]]></description>
