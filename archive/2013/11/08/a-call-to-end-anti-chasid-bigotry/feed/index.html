		<description><![CDATA[The generality can be true (i.e., most Chasidim have lousy English skills). Yet it is still bigotry to insist it is true in every case when discussing a specific case. To have said, &quot;it is a pleasant surprise to see such English skill from a chasid&quot; would have been valid. to insist that this had to be a fraudulent document because it could not have been written by a chosid was bigotry. 

BTW, I think some of the bigotry was exploited by those who just don&#039;t want to concede that biblical criticism could make inroads in the haredi world. But rather than expressing discomfort they tried to claim the document was a fraud and latched onto anti-chasidic bigotry as their method of avoiding the content of the piece, and the otherwise tres chareidi pedigree of the author. If that was the motive, the bigotry is even more shameful because it grew, not out of ignorance, but out of willful reinforcement of stereotypes to win an argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. I loved his article. By treating Torah as monolithic and empirically factual Haredim are actually losing in even religious experience more than they gain in obeisance. The Haredi world falsely portrays their lifestyle as inextricably tied to their fantastical beliefs about history, and it takes time for evolved Haredim to rethink the relationship between historical belief, ideology and practice but it is possible to be Haredi and rational. 



2. I would never have questioned a Satmar chassid&#039;s ability to write such an article. The secular education I and most of my friends received was a joke. But if someone has even a passive intellectual curiosity, it is not that difficult to make up ground. I and many of my childhood Haredi friends have gone on to Ivy-level graduate schools. But it takes luck and we should be very concerned that not enough people are able to recover from a Haredi education.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;This is pure bigotry. And it disgusts me.

Studies exist out there for a simple reason; we accept generalities. The caveat is, that it is backed up by some sort of data. It is far better to look at this the other way around and ask &quot;What have CHASSIDS done to cause this perception to be so accepted?&quot; Frankly, I don&#039;t think there is anything bigoted about people&#039;s bewilderment that a chassid can write the way he did. They are the ones that have cause this perception to exist. If they make a conscience effort to change their communities (and do in fact change it), then I can call out bigotry to anyone that still perceives negatively. If feel people have negative thoughts about individuals, it is only due to the greater community that has not allowed us to look at the individual.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find it amazing how people are so lacking in knowledge (or wisdom) as to not be able to discern between &quot;average&quot; and &quot;individual&quot;. Yes, it is well-known that on average, chassidic skills in English are low, and that they don&#039;t intensely study secular subjects. However, that has no bearing on an individual chassid doing those things and having those skills.


It is the same kind of bigotry that says that since Jews as a group have higher than average incomes, that no Jew is poor. Meanwhile, it is a fact that there are plenty of destitute Jews all over the place.]]></description>
