		<description><![CDATA[I have a problem with these kinds of articles because these are the exceptions that prove the rule. The average Chassidic woman does not and cannot go to law school for a variety of reasons including a poor secular education and societal pressure. That one woman managed to do so is simply an exception.

I hate it when Charedi institutions/people make the claim that their women have free choice and can do whatever they want, because, in reality, NO they can&#039;t.

A few years ago, Aish Hatorah published an article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aish.com/societyWork/work/Women_At_Work.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Women at Work&lt;/a&gt; which claimed that Orthodox women can work at any job that they want. In the Charedi world (and certainly in the Israeli Charedi world) this is simply a very big lie. All the women that she brings as examples fall into one of 2 categories:

1. Baalei teshuva

2. They grew up in modern homes

I find it very offensive when Charedi kiruv institutions use examples of Baalei Teshiva or people who were brought up in a more Modern home. Using these people as examples of how well religious Jews can fit into society is very misleading when the institutions themselves don&#039;t believe in that hashkafa. According to Charedi hashkafa, Modern Orthodoxy is pasul and University study is prohibited, yet those are the examples they site when trying to be mekarev people.

For more see &lt;a href=&quot;http://jewishworker.blogspot.co.uk/2008/03/misleading-statements-in-name-of-kiruv.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Misleading statements in the name of Kiruv&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[She did not say that she argued in her law school class that abortion should not be legal.  She said that she was objecting to the Supreme Court&#039;s reasoning that pregnancy is an onerous burden, because many people, including herself do not view it that way..  She may in fact agree with the SC&#039;s conclusions, but she was objecting to that particular use of language.

Still, I could imagine the eyes rolling in that classroom.  Even if she loves motherhood, that is not a reason to overturn Roe v. Wade.  And her description of labor and delivery is a little too rosy-hued for my liking.  Many of us would rather be having  root canal.  If she is indeed starting an EMT service to help frum women who need emergency services for labor, she better have a little more empathy for the moms who don&#039;t feel they are having &quot;the best day of my life&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was just informed that the girls school that Judy Brown attended, Bais Yaakov D&#039;Gur, is a Bais Yaakov school and they do take the regents exams. That means that only Feldman, who went to Satmar, did not take regents exams. Either way, Freier did not go to a Chasidic school officially makes her an outsider in the Bobov community and we all know that outsiders are treated differently than those who grew up in the community which may very well be the reason as to why she had the opportunity to attend law school to begin with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are times when religious women find pregnancy challenging. There are times when religious women may feel overwhelmed with another pregnancy, as Judy Brown describes — we are human. But those periods pass and when we cradle our newborn babies, we feel blessed and caress our treasured ones with love. 

HOW DOES SHE KNOW THAT THEY WILL PASS? Why should a mother be stuck with a child she will resent forever because she knew throughout the pregnancy that this was one child too many and that she could not handle the burden of this additional child? Why should this child and the other children of this mother have to deal with a mother who is now miserable and depressed because she is so stressed out? Every mother should have the choice to decide for herself what is right and wrong for her family and her body. That is all.]]></description>
