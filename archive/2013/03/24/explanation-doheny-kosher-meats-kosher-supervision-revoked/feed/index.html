Next time you go to synagogue, start thinking what this holiday is actually about it, and what it has actually become.  I don&#039;t think our forefathers were ever concerned about kosher for passover dog food, toothpaste and toilet paper.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Its called consumer demand from those with Yeras Shemayim who want to totally rid their homes of Chometz in all its forms.  If there were no demand for it, the Public would not support it.  I love people who start everything with an attack, and then when someone explains Halacha, they look for the next wrong thing.  How about looking at the good side of all this Arash?  Ask questions respectfully before having to eat your shoe for being a jerk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was excepting to see more of a developed article halachically speaking. Even Failed Messiah targets the RCC&#039;s psak. Since this is Los Angeles nothing will come of this either way, and in a few weeks/months the status quo will be right back to where it was before 3pm Sunday. Their B&#039;Rov Psak before 3pm Sunday is the biggest mockery of Torah to be seen in a while. If they are not clear exactly what the facts are on the ground then why are they even making such claims? Because some P.I. Shaygetz found out before them and now they have to scramble because they had no idea their mashgiach davens at the 8:15 minyan everyday while meat being packaged and moved around? Siman 110 in Taruvos does not seem to cover a person who maliciously mixes treif into kosher. Will the Rabbonim of the RCC eat meat that was bought before 3pm? Was that the brisket at their Seder? The next few weeks will reveal the Emes, and until then we are all just speculating.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Kosher Industry can be corrupt, but its very ignorant and uneducated to lay claim in such a black and white manner. While there is potential for corruption there is also potential for very high standards that cost money to provide for multiple mashgichim and a Rov who is a Talmid Chachom with Yisras Shamayim who is willing to risk his name on something in the name of &quot;Kasher&quot;. As far as halachas of Pesach, it is issur d&#039;orissa to benifit from Chametz in any manner including hanah (benifit) ie: dog food, toothpaste etc. and D&#039;Rabanan (Ashkenaz) to have kitniyos. The halachas of Chametz mirror those of Bassar V&#039;Chalav with cooking, eating, and benifiting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since you may not own chametz on Passover, you may not own or use dog food containing chametz either (though the dog, of course, may eat it).  We here in Israel have &quot;kosher for Passover&quot; dog food which does not contain chametz though it is as unkosher as anything could be as it does contain meat products from non-kosher animals, etc.  This is not exploitation, it costs the same as the regular dog food of the same brand (there are a few at various price/quality levels).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This just goes to show how corrupt the kosher food industry really is.  Where in the torah does it say Jews must use kosher for passover toilet paper and toothpaste?  What&#039;s next, kosher for passover dog food.  The kosher food industry has exploited the torah and the Jewish religion as a money-making scheme, which is disgusting and distasteful.  Let&#039;s hope there is at least some sort of congressional investigation into consumer fraud and misrepresentation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Everyone said Doheny meats tasted the best. I’ve heard this for years. They said the same thing about the guy in Monsey’s meats. Why do non-kosher meats taste better?&lt;/i&gt;


This doesn&#039;t make sense. Even if non-kosher meat tastes better than kosher meat (and I&#039;ve been told the opposite regarding chicken - that kosher chicken tastes better than non-kosher chicken), it is not possible that &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; of Dohenys meat was non-kosher. Because if that were the case, the slaughterhouses would have alerted the kashrut authority much earlier about the fact that Doheny wasn&#039;t buying &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of their product. At best (worst?), &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; of Dohenys meat was non-kosher, and those purchasing meat there would get Kosher or non-Kosher in a hit or miss fashion. So there wouldn&#039;t be any consistency regarding &quot;better&quot; taste due to the status of the meat, it would also be hit or miss.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this update.  As to question three regarding non-kosher meat tasting better, I think this is generally true.  I&#039;m a BT and for 29 years ate non-kosher meat.  For the most part, there is no comparison -  non-kosher meat really does taste markedly better.  The two exceptions I&#039;ve found (there may be many more) are Doheny Meats and Teva Meats, with an edge to Teva Meats.  Teva is sold at the Ralphs in Pico-Robertson and perhaps at other LA locations.]]></description>
