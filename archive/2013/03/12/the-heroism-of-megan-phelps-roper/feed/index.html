		<description><![CDATA[Holy Hyrax: I wasn&#039;t complaining in so much I was pointing out that we have relevant abhorrent practices still today.  (R. Fink seemed to suggest otherwise - that all the abhorrent stuff was a thing of the past.)

Milhouse &amp; MarkSoFla: It seems we&#039;re on the same page.  We have a problem (IMHO it is abhorrent) and we can see potential solutions that our current rabbinic leadership refuses to lift a finger to work towards.   A few, like Rabbi Rackman, have tried, but did not get much support from any part of the Orthodox world.  (This would seem to relate to Centrist/MO rabbis capitulating to the failed chareidi leadership.)]]></description>

If you are going to quote Deut 24:1, then the system is working just fine, correct? The system is built from the get go to only give the man power over divorce. You can&#039;t complain the system is broken. What you need is another system.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t check, but if I recall correctly, it says &quot;if he comes to hate her, he shall write her a writ of divorce&quot;. It doesn&#039;t say anything about the case in which she comes to hate him. Therefore the Rabbis can create a rule for that [different] case.


No doubt, this type of logic has been applied in other areas of Jewish law, and I think it could provide a handy solution to the problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love your last para, but i would note that the drasha of the gemara is not pashut pshat, i.e. a simple reading would not lead one to say that only if he writes a get and gives it willingly is she permitted to another, the whole idea of what constitutes marriage vs divorce seems to be a rabbinic interpretation as there is no clear proof text as to what is the moment when a woman is no longer an eishes ish (and thus not under the arayos prohibition). one could also have been doresh the pesukim so many different ways, as the crux and basic intent here was to note the prohibition of getting back together after a guy initially kicks her out because he hated her (and perhaps the extra stuff is to show how much he hated her, he wrote a document of official separation!). 

Per the Rambam, today&#039;s beis din (if it had the gahonges) could be doresh differently and change the law, but as you note today&#039;s rabbis prefer to just follow our angelic ancestors without regard for the poor and suffering, since we all assume that those rabbis were divinely inspired (maybe starry decisis, get it?).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Deut. 24:1 is not part of our belief?   &quot;And HE shall write for HER a writ of divorce&quot;.  The Torah gives the man complete control of divorce with that verse,  (Only later rabbinic law required that a woman also voluntarily accept it.) 

While we &quot;believe&quot; a man should act like a &quot;mentcsh&quot; and give the get when the marriage is effectively over, there&#039;s no biblical imperative for the man to give it, the Torah doesn&#039;t even address, yet less chastise the recalcitrant husband.  The best the rabbis can do is opine about the &quot;good ole days&quot; when they can send some thugs to force the guy, that with some remarkable logic we don&#039;t call forcing the guy.   Yeah, the system&#039;s not the problem, people who use the system to their advantage is the problem.

The only people who can effect any real change here are a select group of rabbis regarded as &quot;gedolim&quot; the upper echelon of chareidi rabbis.  Everyone else in the Orthodox umbrella sooner or later usually capitulates to their demands or is labeled as a troublemaker and an outcast.  However, those rabbis have failed the community.  I have no ability to affect change, but a new generation of Centrist/MO rabbis like Rabbi Fink might be able to by openly rejecting the chareidi leadership and charting new course.   That&#039;s the motivation for my comments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[goal is of course to get to what is true, and only way is to ask questions, even though sometimes u may not have an answer, in general u will get a better understanding even grappling with possible fixes/answers. i thought your point was its better not to ask questions since answers may not be good enough.

my point is so what, as long as yuo come in truly seeking a better understanding while realizing that your relationship with God is already solid (hopefully you have had a good enough life to reach that point), i don&#039;t think issues or big questions will shake you in the long term, and if they do, it&#039;s prob because you found the better truth!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s worse - abhorrent beliefs or abhorrent practices?

We live in a system where a man can and occasionally does extort unfair concessions from his wife to grant a divorce.  Sometimes, that divorce never comes, leaving her a &quot;agunah&quot; or chained woman.  We believe the system is broken, we believe that&#039;s not supposed to happen and there&#039;s supposed to be a fix for this.  Yet, it happens and a substantial amount of the rabbinical community sits on their hands, both in terms of doing something about current problems and working to reduce the likelihood of it happening in the future (with a pre-nup).

You can choose to ignore this because the divorce rate among Orthodox Jews is still relatively low, and most men give a get without &quot;persuasion&quot;.  However, it&#039;s there, it&#039;s not going away, and most rabbis when approached just shrug their shoulders as if to say &quot;What do you want from me?&quot;

For years and years, all flavors of rabbis in Orthodox Judaism believed it was better to keep sexual abuse under the rug, than out someone and have them prosecuted, and in turn be labeled a &quot;moser.&quot;   The fact that whole concept of mesirah was allowed to carry over from Europe to America for 60 years post WWII and only recently are we seeing this concept being challenged and beliefs changing has been abhorrent.  

I can go on. but what&#039;s the point.  Don&#039;t blind yourself to what&#039;s abhorrent today just because you can discount the notorious biblical ones, like genocide, infanticide,  slavery, etc. as not being relevant today.

You can say you take the good with the bad, and we offer more good.   You can&#039;t deny that there are huge problems that can be labeled abhorrent that still plague us today.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;There are not always good answers. We need to be able to be comfortable without all the answers.&lt;/i&gt;


Why?  If you went to a surgeon and the surgeon didn&#039;t have good answers, you&#039;d find another surgeon.  Obviously, not all questions can be answered easily, but we should seek the best, most likely to be true, answers.


If one doesn&#039;t really want to hear the answer, one should NOT ask the question.]]></description>
