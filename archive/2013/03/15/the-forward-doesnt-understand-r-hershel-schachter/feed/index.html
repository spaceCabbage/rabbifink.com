		<description><![CDATA[you should all keep in mind - agree or don&#039;t agree with R. Schachter - 
that he essentially is correct. The black community, and more so the 
black muslim community, unfortunately share an extremely anti-Semitic 
view of our people. I grew up in a very black city that can&#039;t be too 
hard to guess - the attitude of these people is so vile, I have never 
heard anything  like it even from the WASP contingent, of which the city
 has plenty of as well.
Take for yourselves every large city in 
America that had a Jewish population by the year 1935 - 40. Can you name
 me one city where the blacks didn&#039;t riot in SPECIFICALLY Jewish 
neighborhoods? Find me a metropolitan area that doesn;t have a inner 
city  where the &#039;Church of Our God&#039; is crudely painted over the Shnei 
Haluchos, or a beautiful stained glass fresco depicting the Yomim Noraim
 is plastered with a poster of their despicable savior. For shame!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He said &quot;black Muslim that wants to kill all the Jews.&quot;  There is one black Muslim group that is particularly prevalent in prisons that has anti-semitic beliefs that arguably could be described as &quot;wants to kill all the Jews,&quot; Nation of Islam.  All those are objective facts.  


Let&#039;s be clear here.  You are saying he meant all black muslims.  I am saying that he meant a subset of black Muslims that harbor particular ill will towards Jews. Your explanation is no more simpler than mine.  He didn&#039;t say &quot;all black Muslims want to kill Jews.&quot;  He said a warden (of unknown race) might deliberately put a Jew in a cell with a black Muslim that wants to kill Jews.  The statement is ambiguous.  


He could mean, as you appear to be suggesting, that all black Muslims want to kill all Jews, or he could mean that there is a subset of black Muslims marked by the known hatred for Jews. 


If he would have said &quot;aryan Christians&quot; instead of &quot;black Muslims,&quot; would you have interpreted his statement to be saying that all white Christians want to kill Jews?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He said psychologists who are talmidei chachamim, he didn&#039;t say a &quot;rabbinic panel.&quot; 

And he was discussing a case where it wasn&#039;t clear that there was reasonable suspicion that any abuse had actually occurred.  The situation was ambiguous.  He was recommending the use of psychologists who also had halachic qualifications to clarify the ambiguity. If the psychologist determined that there was reasonable suspicion than they would report it to SCR. 

That is what the law requires.  There has to be reasonable suspicion (&quot;reglayim l&#039;davar&quot; in Hebrew) before the law requires reporting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;[...]  it has a preface &quot;all things being equal.&quot; If there is more evidence on on the side of multiple explanations, then you should assume the more complicated version over the simpler version that has less evidence.&quot;

But what kind of evidence? With Occam&#039;s Razor, it&#039;s implied that simple explanations come from evidence that is already known to be true -- like empirical evidence -- evidence that can be acquired through the five senses.  Things that can be easily explained using empirical evidence tend to trump explanations that are based on evidence we can&#039;t sense.

I listened to the recording -- I didn&#039;t hear RHS utter the phrase &quot;Nation of Islam&quot; in his hypothetical state prison scenario. I did, however, hear him say: &quot;schvartzer&quot;; &quot;Muslim&quot;; and &quot;black Muslim&quot; -- that&#039;s the evidence we actually have.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;A rabbinic panel is not qualified to conduct an investigation. That is the job of the Police.&quot;


It&#039;s not even the job of law enforcement.

In New York State, mandated reporters (e.g. police officers) are required by law to report suspected child abuse or maltreatment to the New York State Central Register (SCR) of Child Abuse and Maltreatment.

The SCR accepts calls from persons who are required by law, or mandated, to report suspected cases of child abuse and maltreatment; and calls from non-mandated reporters, including the public.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;However, in R’ Schachter’s opinion, one can’t go to the authorities unless one has something to report. Unless a victim can state facts with a fair amount of certainty, there is nothing to report.&quot;

This is probably the worst possible for advice to give when trying assess abuse or maltreatment in young children through adolescence. His advice, if this is really what he said, presupposes that a young child or adolescent who has been abused or maltreated is going to be able to verbally convey what has happened to him.

In order to determine suspected cases of abuse and maltreatment, adults with professional roles or official capabilities involving children need to watch for:

* physical indicators of possible child abuse
* emotional and behavioral signs of possible child abuse
* physical signs of possible child neglect
* signs of possible child sexual abuse
* emotional and behavioral signs of possible child sexual abuse; these may be quite distinct between children under eight years of age and child over eights years of age through adolescence

One who relies solely on what a child in his charge verbally conveys to him, is one who shirks his duty to that child.]]></description>

His advice, if this is really what he said, presupposes that a young child or adolescent who has been abused or maltreated is going to be able to verbally convey what has happened to him.

In order to determine suspected cases of abuse and maltreatment, adults with professional roles or official capabilities involving children need to watch for:

* physical indicators of possible child abuse
* emotional and behavioral signs of possible child abuse
* physical signs of possible child neglect
* signs of possible child sexual abuse
* emotional and behavioral signs of possible child sexual abuse; these may be quite distinct between children under eight years of age and child over eights years of age through adolescence

One who relies solely on what a child in his charge verbally conveys to him, is one who shirks his duty to that child.]]></description>

Here he said &quot;a black Muslim that wants to kill all the Jews.&quot;  He didn&#039;t say all black Muslims want to kill all the Jews, he was describing a subset of black Muslims. I know of one such subset, the Nation of Islam.  They also happen to be particularly prevalent in prisons. Therefore the evidence indicates that he was speaking about Nation of Islam.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;will now never disclose their abuse because their esteemed andidealized Rebbe said that doing so may have grave consequences FOR THE ABUSER
and that it may be against Halacha to do so!&quot;


That isn&#039;t what he said, even at face value.  He never said that abused children shouldn&#039;t report the abuse.  Did you listen to the shiur? 


Btw, if you were a criminal defense lawyer, and you saw the way DA&#039;s sometimes go after people and the tactics they sometimes use (in and out of the courtroom) or if you or a close relative/friend had been wrongly accused, do you think you might be a little more understanding of Rabbi Shachter&#039;s position?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You say that Rabbi Schachter&#039;s position is unreasonable and immoral and then cite a reason that is easily correctable within this system.  You have the professionals talk to the child within 24 hours, and in the meantime you force the accused take a sick day.  

If you, a close relative or friend was accused, would you want it to go straight to the police, or would you like an objective psychologist make an assessment first? If someone called the police and the DA decided to put in all his efforts into getting a conviction, even if you were eventually cleared after a year of fighting the charges, would you be satisfied with the &quot;law enforcement and the child welfare system.&quot;?  

Of course if we have a situation involving a close family member on either side we will be extremely biased and prone to making unwise, snap decisions.  What we want is to examine the problem from an objective, unemotional position. 



I understand the position that says that we have to err on the side of protecting children even if it means ruining innocent people.  But don&#039;t think that innocent people won&#039;t have their lives ruined if there is a blanket policy of calling CPS and the police.  And don&#039;t act like it is immoral and unreasonable to be concerned about that problem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink - I strongly encourage you to watch this short clip: http://www.illdoctrine.com/2008/07/how_to_tell_people_they_sound.html

Your defense of R&#039; Shachter&#039;s character is a total red herring. You responded to the charge &quot;he said something racist&quot; with the claim &quot;he is not a racist.&quot; Unfortunately, the world is not divided into good people and racists. I&#039;ve never met R&#039; Shachter personally, so if you say he is certainly not a racist, I&#039;ll take you at your word - but you don&#039;t have to BE a racist to SAY something racist. 

So it doesn&#039;t matter that R&#039; Shachter &quot;is one of the nicest, sweetest people&quot; you have ever met, or that he &quot;doesn&#039;t have a negative bone in his body.&quot; What matters is that he made racist comments, and he should be held accountable for that mistake, especially since he is a public figure and a mouthpiece of the Jewish community.

But that&#039;s only half the issue. You also claim that his use of the word &quot;schvartze&quot; was not racist at all because he wasn&#039;t using it &quot;in a negative sense.&quot; I guess that what you mean by this is, he wasn&#039;t saying &quot;nigger,&quot; he was saying &quot;black person,&quot; and furthermore what he really meant to refer to was the Nation of Islam. As other commenters have pointed out, R&#039; Shachter could have said that a Jew might get stuck in a cell with a skinhead, a neo-Nazi, a jihadist Muslim, or better yet simply an anti-Semite, who wants to kill him. The fact that he jumped right to &quot;schvartzes&quot; who want to kill Jews is racist in and of itself, because it enforces stereotypes of blacks as violent and indiscriminately angry. It&#039;s not his choice of words (&quot;schvartze&quot; instead of &quot;black person&quot;) that&#039;s the issue here - it&#039;s the choice of black Muslims as his example of a dangerous cellmate for a Jew. 

I was so disappointed to see you defending these comments, Rabbi Fink.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry about the mistake. I listened to the audio. I believe he means well with his focus on mesira but he made an egregious error which is why rabbis should not be in this position of making such decisions. He dismissed and minimized the shame the victim felt about speaking to the school psychologist. At that point, Rabbi Schachter needed to report it. It wasn&#039;t ok to leave it.... it led to much horror for years to come. The intention of his speech was a good one but he indicts himself in his off the cuff anecdote... This doesn&#039;t mean he&#039;s a bad leader.. it just means he messed up in a big way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay, first of all. RHS IS NOT MY REBBE. He doesn&#039;t even know who I am. I heard his speak twice and spoke with him for a few minutes afterward.

You weren&#039;t saying I don&#039;t know any abuse victims, but the person whose comments you were endorsing did say that.

I did not defend Rav Bina.



RHS believes that every orthodox Jew wants to follow halacha. This is a halachic syhla in his opinion. Not everyone has to agree with that. He doesn&#039;t think anyone should be spared because they are a yid. His concern was only that an innocent Jew be placed in mortal danger.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[See this blog for more info about how Rav Soloveitchik responded to child abuse allegations. I don&#039;t understand how all these rabbeim / current Rosh Yeshiva at YU who were taught by the Rav have forgotten his message. 

&quot;The Rav impassionedly cried out:” Those who ask ‘what about the parnassa
 of the teacher?’ must be rebutted with the question ‘what about the 
children, what about the children?”

		<description><![CDATA[If children were still at risk of abuse (and Finkelstein stayed on past the 80s when this allegedly happened)- then I believe he was still required to report it. 

I&#039;m not sure how you&#039;re equating the two comments above. I wasn&#039;t saying that you must  not know anyone who has been abused- but I am saying you seem to be weighing in only to protect your rebbe from being fallible - over the possiblity of a child&#039;s abuse. We Jews have Teshuva . God gave this to us as an acknowledgement that we are all fallible. If our community learns anything from all of this it&#039;s that children matter more than reputations! Plus.. just b/c a leader is criticized (and he should be if he makes irresponsible impulsive comments) doesn&#039;t mean he is bad.... it just means he&#039;s human. Great. If we can acknowledge that- we raise the bar on integrity and humility!

 

Also per comments below, a Rabbi needs to care about how his comments affect his community. Lately Rabbis seem to think they can say anything.. they can totally defend Rav Bina in the Hakotel abuse dismissing what&#039;s been done &quot;well he helps kids...so what if he abuses..?&quot;  and make sweeping psychological statements about victims such as &quot;well they should have come forward sooner&quot;. This is out of control and  beyond insensitive and not their area to comment upon.  More is asked of leaders. They need to carefully choose their words. Their words are very powerful and impact thousands.  I think when you say it&#039;s good for a rabbi not to care what pple think it applies more with regard to not being influenced / swayed by social fears (fears that jews will go to jail.. that a leader will look bad etc..) which I agree with. They need to be firm in their commitment to truth which seems awry here.

I see that he says mesira is not an issue but I also do not think it&#039;s a rabbi&#039;s place to make decisions about not reporting ever. It&#039;s not his place. It&#039;s caused too much harm.

Lastly, if someone molests children, they go to jail. That&#039;s how it goes. They don&#039;t get to be spared jail b/c they are a &quot;yid&quot; . They needed to consider that before they ruined the lives of jewish children. 

I don&#039;t wish RHS any harm or vilification- I think he can make it right in some way by owning it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hang on a second. The therapist was right that if I defend RHS that means I don&#039;t know anyone who has been abused? What kind of sick is that to say? Neither or you have any way of knowing that. And that is what I objected to so strongly.


You obviously did not listen to the audio. He says at least 20 times to go to the authorities. There is no mesira.


The only issue is where there is a possibility that a child has been molested and no one knows if there is something to report. In that case he advised going to a psychologist, preferably one who is a talmid chacham, who is able to appreciate the gravity of reporting.


In any case of a mandated reporter I guarantee that he would require reported because of dina d&#039;malchusa dina. He is very makpid on that.


In his anecdote he was saying that a victim has to speak up so that abuse will stop. That was his point. If the victims won&#039;t speak up there is nothing he or anybody else can do.


He was not a mandated reporter in that case, just for the record. Even the Forward has not accused him of breaking any laws. So let&#039;s slow down with that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This piece is incredibly off base and disturbing. The therapist who weighed in below is 100% correct and Rabbi, if you cannot learn to hear other people&#039;s comments without immediately launching into a counterattack- you need to do some serious reflection if you are going to continue to be a leader.  Rabbis are supposed to represent morality and integrity and not just defend someone the first inkling of anything negative; they are the hearts of our people and they have to go into their hearts too before blurting things out. Your piece is a complete rationalization of all that happened witthout any seeming reflection on the child/ children who were affected. Why do only rabbis get sympathy but children whose lives were tainted get shoved under the bus? What happened to this community? its so glaringly embarassing!

I understand you look up to him but he&#039;s human and he too- like all of us- makes mistakes and clearly has some errors in his judgments. 

In New York State- school officials are not given permission to &quot;decide&quot; if they believe a victim. They are mandated reporters and they need to report cases of suspected abuse that are brought to them by children/ teens. End of Story.  When will all of the rabbis wake up to the truth about the humility they are lacking? . The Rav would turn over in his grave if he saw/ heard any of this going on and all these rabbis defending each other over protecting children. Rav Soloveitchik stood for compassion and said himself that you don&#039;t ask a rabbi to decide things of this nature. 

 Rabbi Fink, if your child told you someone molested him - would you have Rabbi Schachter and company determine IF they thought it was true rather than believing your child? Coming forward with sexual abuse takes enormous courage in a community that  more and more does NOT side with them and even blames them -and so if a child finally comes forward- its not a rabbis&#039; place to decide if he believes it first, before he reports it, unless we believe rabbis are above the law (which apparently many leaders believe).

Additionally- there are so many problems with what Rabbi Schachter said particularly the fact that he not only messed up by not reporting this information which was HIS negligence which led to 100&#039;s of more abused kids but he then turns it around and blames the victim for his errors? This is a serious problem that he will have to reckon with.]]></description>
