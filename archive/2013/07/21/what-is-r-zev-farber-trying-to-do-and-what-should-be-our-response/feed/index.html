		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with Rabbi Helfgot&#039;s position-- and not just because he&#039;s my father :). It&#039;s nice to know that while some on the very left (some might say separated from) Modern Orthodoxy aim to accommodate biblical criticism at the expense of Torah, my dad is a clear supporter of Torah and Hashem. May I be zoche to follow in that path.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Every serious Jew should admit that belief (in any given event or &quot;fact&quot; as related by Tanakh) is not central to Judaism. Indeed it can be terribly distracting and lead us astray from God&#039;s path for us.

The Shadal, Rabbi Shmuel David Luzzatto (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_David_Luzzatto) once explained very clearly in a letter to a struggling congregant that a Jew is not required to believe in any particular thing stated in Tanakh. Shadal brings his proofs,

• &quot;Moses did not dictate articles of faith, because God does not command belief, that is, He does not command that which cannot be commanded.&quot;
• &quot;[Moses&#039; transmission of the Torah] does not teach a new morality, but dictates a code that does no more than develop and sanctify the principles of humanity and justice that Abraham taught.&quot; In other words: All Jews are expected to believe in are the principles of humanity and justice that Abraham and Sarah taught. These principles are not legitimized by any events, but by the kind of rational kindheartedness for which Abraham was praised and made founding father.
• God assigns punishments for many transgressions but never mentions the sin of disbelief
• God never categorizes anti-religious speech as sin (unless it leads to idolatry, or cursing God, which themselves leads to *actual* sins)
• The prophets and ancient rabbis never mention articles of faith
• Regarding atheists, &quot;Scripture detests the atheist, but the atheist of depraved conduct.&quot; In other words: Scripture only detests atheists who act badly as a result of their atheism.

		<description><![CDATA[Except that there is no pre-Reform source that thought medrashim had literal validity, AND you&#039;re conflating idiom with metaphor. Idiom is a non-literal turn of phrase, but what is being described actually happened. So even as an atteempt at dark humor, it doesn&#039;t work.


In any case, no one (again, until the counter-reformation) assumed medrashim were historical. They&#039;re supposed to be metaphor ACCORDING to the Oral Torah itself. The same is true of Bereishis 1. Find me a rishon who believed that 7000 years ago, the universe didn&#039;t exist yet. I can&#039;t find one who didn&#039;t drop a statement or two otherwise. But even if both opinions were documented (I realize there are people who would chafe at my claim), at least we could say the Torah doesn&#039;t /insist/ on a young universe. Only the Written Torah does. Again, unlike Yetzias Mitzrayim.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Off topic first (it&#039;s shorter): but your examples are akh and et.  Those are mentioned in midrashe halakha etc.  What about tagin?


On topic: So that&#039;s why I responded to specific arguments you were making that i thought were faulty.  Stick to your main argument.  I&#039;m also not sure in intellectually honest discussion how many members we retain is so important.  What if Reform worked?  Certainly Christianity worked.  That doesn&#039;t mean we say we should abandon halakha and support Christianity.  So if Conservative were true and it still lost members, it wouldn&#039;t stop me from being Conservative.  &quot;kiruv&quot; needs to be within the guidelines of what hashem wants from us.  Or the authors of the tora.  ;P (rakhmana litslan)

But yes, you quoted exactly what I was referring to.  First he starts of by saying the tora shebikhtav was written with human prophecy.  Then he says that Judaism is an &quot;eternal wave.&quot;  So when did revelation stop?  Or is it ongoing?  And is more like Mormon revelation (continuing prophecy) or Protestant revelation?  We each get to decide and interpret what we think the tora means (obviously with divine inspiration we are all gifted with)?  And what if that led us to the conclusion we should initiate human sacrifice or literal ayin takhat ayin?  What if that meant we should still be stripping suspected adulteresses in public?  What else does looking at the text in its original purity mean?  How can it always mean whatever the Progressive Left says?  Are these atheists now the only humans on earth still receiving n&#039;vua?  With all respect to R&#039; Fink, I just don&#039;t see a shred of intellectual honest or courage from this guy.

Here&#039;s what I posted elsewhere here an on Brill&#039;s blog:

Is Farber serious when he thinks that the g’dolim of each generation have been guided by prophecy or ruakh hakodesh? In other words, is this an argument for continuing prophecy of some select individuals ala the Mormon church or some kind of Lutheran-Protestant idea that we are each individually given the gift of divine inspiration in our reading of the tora? I assume it’s the former (and encompasses everyone who the community has followed until now. Because if it’s the latter, we wouldn’t have much of a community and halakha wouldn’t make much sense (why follow what someone else had as divine inspiration when I have it too and it mine says something completely different).

But then, if I understand this correctly, shouldn&#039;t we be even more dogmatic in our approach to halakha/hashkafa? In other words, if hashem is guiding how we have interpreted the tora until now (and how it was stitched together when we go back to the written text), then we can’t really look back at anything historically and decide to interpret it differently now. Or if some of us do, they may turn out in a few hundred years to have been wrong because hashem will have the community following someone else…

My only guess is that eh believes this ruakh hakodesh period ended at some point. But when? After khumash? After y’hoshua? After ester? After ezra? After r’ y’huda hanasi? After ramba”m?]]></description>

In other words, is this an argument for continuing prophecy of some select individuals ala the Mormon church or some kind of Lutheran-Protestant idea that we are each individually given the gift of divine inspiration in our reading of the tora? I assume it’s the former (and encompasses everyone who the community has followed until now. Because if it’s the latter, we wouldn’t have much of a community and halakha wouldn’t make much sense (why follow what someone else had as divine inspiration when I have it too and it mine says something completely different).</p>
<p>But then, if I understand this correctly, shouldn&#8217;t we be even more dogmatic in our approach to halakha/hashkafa? In other words, if hashem is guiding how we have interpreted the tora until now (and how it was stitched together when we go back to the written text), then we can’t really look back at anything historically and decide to interpret it differently now. Or if some of us do, they may turn out in a few hundred years to have been wrong because hashem will have the community following someone else…</p>
<p>My only guess is that eh believes this ruakh hakodesh period ended at some point. But when? After khumash? After y’hoshua? After ester? After ezra? After r’ y’huda hanasi? After ramba”m?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[On topic: That&#039;s been my point repeated ad nauseum on this comment chain. There is no definition of kefirah that can accept an adaptation that robs halakhah its roots. Which Farber does. And he follows up by saying we need to rethink halakhah in this light: &lt;i&gt;In my view, Judaism is essentially a wave  that eternally sends the messages of God. However, in order to understand how to apply these messages we must understand how any given halacha or ideal functioned in any given society, particularly the original society, ancient Israel. When we understand this, we can “subtract” the societal elements to see the ideas in their relative purity and reapply them to our times.&lt;/i&gt;

The Jewish community already tried that experiment, combining bible criticism and historical school to justify a different legal process. And its followers have been trying to pull out of a nosedive for about a decade now. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/2011/apr/12/local/la-me-conservative-jews-20110412&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;LA Times: 12-Apr-2011&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Leaders of Conservative Judaism press for change as movement&#039;s numbers drop&quot;)

Off topic: I think that medrash refers to a fundamental machloqes between the two schools of medrashei halakhah. In R&#039; Yismael&#039;s beis medrash they taught that &quot;the Torah speaks in the language of man&quot;, and what was relevant to derashah was the meaning of clauses, not the word choice. In R&#039; Aqiva&#039;s beis medrash, they darshened based on specific words (eg &quot;akh&quot; is a limiting term, every &quot;es&quot; adds something despite being needed by the grammar of the verse, etc...) And so, Rabbi Aqiva learned &quot;piles and piles of &lt;b&gt;halakhos&lt;/b&gt;&quot; out of the letters and tagin of the Torah, in contrast to Rabbi Yishmael. I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aishdas.org/asp/2005/09/midrashei-halakhah.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;blogged about the schools of medrashei halakhah&lt;/a&gt; and the books they left us over on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aishdas.org/asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Aspaqlaria&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First on-topic: Farber is NOT saying that hashem gave us a complicated tora so we can grapple with it.  He is saying that n&#039;viim over time wrote down the tora.  That much of the lack of smoothness is as a result of their human input and different perspective, just like n&#039;vua in n&#039;viim.  Does that mean we can learn anything like the d&#039;rashot that are used by khaza&quot;l?  I wouldn&#039;t think so, but apparently he doesn&#039;t want to throw out halakha as is.  Maybe he has a more Halivni worldview that halakha was preserved orally and the tora shebikhtav was corrupted.  Lord knows.  Because at the same time he also wants to change halakha radically through reexamination of the original texts.  I&#039;m  not sure hie theory was ready for primetime, but that&#039;s just me.  I still say dropping the whole Jewish thing is the only natural thing to do if you believe any of this.


Off-topic: did r&#039; akiva learn halakhot out of the tagin or just &quot;tora&quot; (not sure what I even mean by that)?  I mean we don&#039;t have any Talmudic literature that says anything about the tagin, which you think would be important if it was halakha, or am I wrong and we do have such literature?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t imagine you aren&#039;t fulfilling the mitsva if you sit and eat in sukot and think of how hashem protected us on our journey from idolatry to being the am hanivkhar.  What if you just sit and eat in a suka and most of the time think about nothing in particular like me and most Jews?  What we call &quot;stam daas&quot; in Yeshivish.


I don&#039;t know that there need be any direct halachic implications.  But Farber gives away his corrupt hand when he does try to extend his belief system into halakha and say that now we need to go back and re-evaluate halakha in light of his new system.  Why is that?  If this is what hashem said through n&#039;vua and it has been interpreted by the rabanan, etc., etc., why would that have any impact on halakha?  And, further, as I mentioned, I am going out on a limb here and saying that when he reinterprets halakha he isn&#039;t going to be arguing for a stricter interpretation of ayin takhat ayin but rather for a more lenient interpretation of mishhkav zakhar.  And that gives away his whole project as a push for Progressivism rather than an intellectually honest reevaluation of matan tora.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a machloqes between R&#039; Yochanan and Reish Laqish about when the Written Torah was given. R&#039; Yochanan says it was given piece by piece during the period from Horeb (Mt Sinai) until Moshe&#039;s death in Arvos Moav. According to Reish Laqish, it was given all at once at the end of Moshe&#039;s life. (My mnemonic: R&#039; Yochanan was an &quot;FFB&quot; and acquired his Torah in a life-long process. Reish Laqish was a &quot;BT&quot; and picked up his Torah later in life.)

Toras Kohanim on the title verse of Parashas BeHar famously (thanks to Rashi) tells you that the entire halakhah was given at Mt Sinai. (I assume this refers to the process, not every since law. See the aggadic story about Moshe Rabbeinu visiting R&#039; Aqiva&#039;s class, where he didn&#039;t know every law, and &quot;ein beis medrash belo chidush -- there is no study hall without innovation&quot;.)

In any case, notice thst all agree that the Oral Torah came first. The Written Torah captures some part of what was already given, and does not according to any of the above represent the first giving of the ideas.

Which is really my primary problem with this whole thing... If you really believe that Hashem gave us the Written Torah as a seed for the halachic process, that the text has a non-smooth side because we&#039;re supposed to grapple with it and find Oral Torah, then what would be the motivation for accepting a Document Hypothesis (of any variation) to begin with? There is no question for it to answer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did once get R&#039; Adlerstein to admit that belief in the Exodus as allegory wouldn&#039;t make one a heretic.  But I did not go as far as matan tora.

At any rate, R&#039; Fink, the thing that makes Farber out and out heretical is not how much of the tora is allegory but how much was not given to us directly by hashem, but through the agency of multiple prophets down through the ages.  

This is what I got out Farber&#039;s article (posted on Brill&#039;s website):

Is Farber serious when he thinks that the g’dolim of each generation have been guided by prophecy or ruakh hakodesh? In other words, is this an argument for continuing prophecy of some select individuals ala the Mormon church or some kind of Lutheran-Protestant idea that we are each individually given the gift of divine inspiration in our reading of the tora? I assume it’s the former (and encompasses everyone who the community has followed until now. Because if it’s the latter, we wouldn’t have much of a community and halakha wouldn’t make much sense (why follow what someone else had as divine inspiration when I have it too and it mine says something completely different).

But then, if I understand this correctly, shouldn’t we be even more dogmatic in our approach to halakha/hashkafa? In other words, if hashem is guiding how we have interpreted the tora until now (and how it was stitched together when we go back to the written text), then we can’t really look back at anything historically and decide to interpret it differently now. Or if some of us do, they may turn out in a few hundred years to have been wrong because hashem will have the community following someone else…

My only guess is that eh believes this ruakh hakodesh period ended at some point. But when? After khumash? After y’hoshua? After ester? After ezra? After r’ y’huda hanasi? After ramba”m?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hate having to argue a position I disagree with in the end, but...  


(1) SA obviously did not believe what Faber is saying, so don&#039;t quote him in this argument;


(2) Why can&#039;t hashem tell us to do something to remember the allegorical principle?  Let&#039;s say that the Exodus never happened (not my belief!), but is an allegory (or prophetic interpretation of reality) of how hashem formed the Jewish people as we know it by saving us from the yoke of hedonism and commanded us to remember that every year with lots of awesome ritual?  This isn&#039;t a very good attack on Faber&#039;s worldview.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is so interesting.  I was thinking the other day that if Reform wanted to succeed in Israel then a rabbi just had to get s&#039;mikha and not call himself Reform.  I never heard of this Sherlo before.  R; Fink considers him important, but what he says is obviously heretical.  Not even Marc Shapiro amu&quot;sh could come up with someone who said sinai didn&#039;t happen in his great book on the ikare emuna.


The question is was the majority of the substance of the tora directly given by hashem to moshe (as opposed to individual p&#039;sukim here and there) or was it a divinely inspired book?  Did all the Jewish people encounter hashem directly in a public event or is that some lame allegory for people studying the natural world and discovering G-d together?  Jewish belief has always been that the n&#039;viim couldn&#039;t add or subtract laws (as it says in Deuteronomy).  But if the whole thing is just a bunch of n&#039;vua...?


Sadly people like Sherlo only back up the ridiculous kharei claim that dati l&#039;umi are r&#039;shaim.  b&quot;h Tzohar distanced itself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for responding despite my caveat.  And I&#039;m sure that it&#039;s only because the articles I&#039;m being sent are the &quot;controversial&quot; ones.  :)  I should read some your regular divre tora when i have the chance.


Anyway, back to the point.  Don&#039;t you think it&#039;s a fair assumption (if not obvious) that when he is citing the academic view as simpler it is laudatory and reflective of where the author was leaning?  Otherwise, what&#039;s the uproar?  Plenty of people have said the academic approach is simpler.  It often is.  That&#039;s just factual.  And as you said, it doesn&#039;t make it true, just &quot;simpler.&quot;  Obviously an honest reader knew where Faber was going (and even you admit that reader was correct in retrospect if not aforehand).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink - while I generally support your approach to most issues I fear that in this instance you are allowing you emotions to over ride your intellect. I too worry about how narrow Orthodoxy is becoming and reflexively wish to defend progressive thinkers from unfair attacks. However, when I took a step back and carefully read Rabbi Farber&#039;s initial long article the conclusion was inescapable. Zev may personally be a wonderfully learned man who personally keeps mitzvot and truly believes that his efforts are pure, but his words are heretical and if taken to their logical conclusion simply undermine halacha as we know it. He is not merely taking Rav Yoel and  Rav Yuval a step further; after all the semantics and sophistry he is denying Torah Misinai and advocating an illogical Judaism where keeping mitzvot would be a nice idea but not obligatory. (I am sure that Zev himself can live with the dissonance but I can not imagine any high school student who hears his theory and would think that there is any reason to believe in Judaism more than any other religion.)


Moreover, I was shocked by the questions that he found unanswerable that required his radical suggestion. I will highlight two them and note that if this is what Biblical Criticism hangs its hat on then the discipline is really deserving of derision. Rabbi Farber is troubled by the fact that Sarah can laugh because she is too old to have children but can still be considered attractive to Pharaoh.To quote the SNL routine - really? Without being vulgar can we not name women who are over 70 (and are not having children) but are still attractive. (Has anyone seen Raquel Welch or Jane Fonda recently).


In a comparable vein he is bothered by Yaakov having 11 children in seven years  - even though it is with four wives - and he is particularly surprised that Leah herself has seven of them. Once again I must say - really? Do we all not know Charedi families that have children every year; is that so surprising that our only conclusion is that the Avot never existed nor did Revelation at Sinai occur? 


Now I know that he brings up other questions but the two I noted are sadly not exaggerated or taken out of context. Once again, I do understand your reflexive reaction but if you show his article to a person without any agenda I believe the only conclusion that can be drawn is that his words are inconsistent with Orthodoxy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink:


Please note the following passage from Baba Basra 14A that I am sure you are familiar with:


&quot;A certain Rabbi was sitting before R. Samuel b. Nahmani and in the course of his expositions remarked, Job never was and never existed, but is only a typical figure. He replied: To confute such as you the text says, There was a man in the land of Uz, Job was his name. But, he retorted, if that is so, what of the verse, The poor man had nothing save one poor ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up etc. Is that anything but a parable? So this too is a parable. If so, said the other, why are his name and the name of his town mentioned?&quot;


Clearly, the position of the Gemara is that one is not allowed to &quot;wili nilli&quot; maintain that certain verses or events are allegories, unless there irrefutable evidence that it was meant to be allegorical. In the case of Eyov, if the story was meant to be a fable, there would be no need to mention the individual&#039;s name or where he was from. These have no purpose in teaching the ideas that the story was meant to convey. Therefore, if it was included, it was to demonstrate that Eyov was a real person who actually existed. How much more so would we maintain with regards to the entire Torah that one should not maintain that it is merely allegory and that these events never occurred.]]></description>

He replied: To confute such as you the text says, There was a man in the land of Uz, Job was his name. But, he retorted, if that is so, what of the verse, The poor man had nothing save one poor ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up etc. Is that anything but a parable? So this too is a parable. If so, said the other, why are his name and the name of his town mentioned?&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly, the position of the Gemara is that one is not allowed to &#8220;wili nilli&#8221; maintain that certain verses or events are allegories, unless there irrefutable evidence that it was meant to be allegorical. In the case of Eyov, if the story was meant to be a fable, there would be no need to mention the individual&#8217;s name or where he was from. These have no purpose in teaching the ideas that the story was meant to convey. Therefore, if it was included, it was to demonstrate that Eyov was a real person who actually existed. How much more so would we maintain with regards to the entire Torah that one should not maintain that it is merely allegory and that these events never occurred.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Worth pointing out what Prof. Schiffman (now at YU) writes on pp. 37-8 in &lt;i&gt;Qumran and Jerusalem&lt;/i&gt; (Eerdmans, 2010):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the most significant of the Qumran scrolls are certainly the biblical manuscripts.  These documents will shed important new light on the history of the biblical text in Second Temple times.


The last statement is itself much more important than meets the eye.  In the early years of Qumran studies, it was thought that the biblical texts from Qumran would somehow illuminate the “original” text that emerged from ancient Israel.  This entire notion has been proven wrong.  It is now clear that the biblical text has a history of transmission, and that major parts of this history, which indeed testify to the place of Scripture in the Judaism of the post-biblical period, are to be understood from the scrolls.  Indeed, we now know that many textual variants result not only from transmission, but from interpretation and linguistic updating, phenomena that, before the discovery of the scrolls, could not have been understood. &lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did any one bother reading Farbers entire article. I really couldn&#039;t stomach reading the whole thing. Simply because I can&#039;t stand his weaseling around. He starts with a conclusion: Traditional Judaism is false. Now, the race to find nonsensical quotes and historical moments of paradigm shifts. He quotes chazal as calling the Torah as Torat Chayim as if that is supposed to really support his conclusion. Then he starts bringing up geocentricity as if it is supposed to mean anything. Those paradigm shifts are nothing compared to what he wants from us: to accept his conclusion. Those paradigm shifts did not attack the very foundation of the religion. So these are meaningless paradigm shifts don&#039;t come close to him wanting us to move on from believing the events in the Torah did not happen. 

R&#039; Farber, we get it. You love Judaism. It is your identity. You see the writing on the wall that basically we are living in the time of seeing the end of traditional Judaism and you want to do somthing about it. 

Oddly enough, I think, Christianity might do a bit better surviving the onslaught of academia. Christianiy&#039;s contact point is with Jesus. Jews&#039; contact point is the Torah. I have spoken to many devote Christians who simply believe the OT is inspiration. But as long as the notion of Jesus surviving, they are ok. This is probably because as much as you can have theological issues with Jesus, his divinity is not really empirically testable.....so evolutionary speaking, they are much more adaptable. Traditionally Judaism is empirically testable because it rests on historical events and a book. Judaism is a lot less adaptable in this sense because of its testability. 

Farber perhaps is trying to take his cues from Christianity and sort of regulate the Torah as a &quot;truth&quot; the same way Christians see it. This is bound to fail because the OT is simply not as critical to Christians as it is for Jews. Christians have Jesus to rest their heads on just in case. Jews have nothing else]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No he&#039;s not. He is using it exactly as it is understand. You are just REALLY uncomfortable with the consequence. If the very pillar of the religion never happened then perpetuating that story as an event that actually happened is a lie. Also, if the pillar never happened, why would you even believe in a god called Hashem. The only document that testifies to that diety is a the very document in question. 


Think about it from another perspective. Here is God, seeking to share his wisdom with the world. It&#039;s been workign out for a couple of thousand years. One basic story has been passed. Now, we evidence counters it. Doesn&#039;t God think this is going to make him look REALLY bad. Why would he perpetuate somthing that humans later are simply going to scratch their heads and come to conclusions that he didn&#039;t give them any truth at all? Wouldn&#039;t God know humans would eventually evolve to an evidence based life form and seek truth through empirical testing. Surely God would prepare for that and give a story that can survive anything. At least the reform are honest and simply say man made this up to the best of their ability to tell the story of their God. That&#039;s it. NO KVETCHING.


The story of Sinai was never to be taken as allegory. The only reason you would accept it and still claim it as some &quot;truth&quot; is testament to how far Judaism has fallen.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This a great comment IMO. Ahistorical is not false either?

Why don&#039;t we take this to the next logical outcome of this. IF FInk is ok with allegorizing or false information, how far does that go? Lets take some in the Christian community that believe evangelical Christianity MUST accept the results of evolution and biblical criticism. Peter Enns from Patheos.com is a great example. By following the evidence he has come to the conclusion that there was no biblical Abraham, YET, he still believes in the divinity of Jesus Christ. When confronted with the idea that you can&#039;t have a Jesus without the the idea of a covenant with Israel beginning Abraham he simply starts with his apologetics and dancing around the issue. Whats the difference between farber and Enns?

Fink, this seems to be the same issue that Kugel had and I will repeat a criticism lodged against him. How much can you rip apart the walls, the tiles, strip the copper wiring and plumbing and still call it a Judaism that actually represents an ACTUAL event in history that God talked to the Jewish nation? Why not allegorize that as well? And once you start doing that, ask yourself how much of anything authentic is left to motivate people to keep any of the traditions?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although it is interesting that not one of the 0.004% of the Toral number of letters that we disagree on actually impact translation OR established derashos.

Besides, well before there was an Ashkenaz or Sepharad, R&#039; Meir wrote that the sifrei Torah of his day we not accurate in full vs plene spellings. That plus his own experience with the Ben Asher manuscript and his knowledge that the mesoretes of Ben Naftali differed, I don&#039;t think the Rambam meant an obligation to believe we got the spelling right. Besides, his article of faith also includes the continuity of the Oral Torah from Sinai to the believer, which is clearly about content, not spelling.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Either way it is undeniable that copying editors have crept into Torah scrolls over time.  The standard way of dealing with this problem was coparing as many scrolls as possible and going with the majority to produce a new &quot;master&quot; scroll.  I believe this was done over and over throughout the generations, and it serves to correct most of the mistakes that crop up.  Obviously some still remain because there are some differences between Ashkenazi, Sephardi and Teimani scrolls.]]></description>
