		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;How does a yeshiva student know that there is a G-d?

The Rambam says so, and the Ra&#039;avad doesn&#039;t argue.&lt;/i&gt;


We use medical knowledge for medicine, mechanical knowledge for machines, etc.

Why must we accept any other epistemology as equal to, or better than, our mesorah - for knowledge of our mesorah, and the practical application thereof, halacha?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a theme of not mixing kinds running through a lot of mitzvos. Don’t mix wool (animal) with linen (plant), don’t mix different types of plant and animal, don’t mix different kinds of food, don’t mix holy with non-holy, and so on.

Some of it is cults. Some of it may be from clinically OCD religious leaders sharing their neurosis. And lots of it is other stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You brought polygamy as an example of something that was thought to be &quot;true&quot; and when found to be &quot;untrue&quot; it was &quot;discarded as soon as possible, whether via reinterpretation, or by clear declaration&quot;. I was simply saying that polygamy was never a &quot;truth&quot;, and therefore doesn&#039;t prove the point you&#039;re supposedly trying to show.

As to Chalav Israel. I don&#039;t get your point. Which truth was found to be not so and &quot;discarded as soon as possible, whether via reinterpretation, or by clear declaration&quot;?]]></description>

The thing is, I&#039;m not sure how you are defining &quot;traditional Judaism&quot;. Traditional according to who? Traditional from the 1900&#039;s? The 1800&#039;s? The 1100&#039;s?

		<description><![CDATA[Polygamy isn&#039;t something that can be true or untrue. It just &quot;is&quot; - it either exists or does not exist. It existed for a long time, then it went out of fashion (among Europeans, including Jewish Europeans), and sometime later a famous European Rabbi garnered enough support against it to impose a declaration that it is not permissible anymore.


I think everyone knows the rough history of it, so I&#039;m not quite sure what you are asking.


Want a more recent example? Milk. Regular milk, because of national milk purity laws in America was accepted as kosher for many decades. Sometime later, certain American Rabbis garnered enough support against regular milk that they were able to create rules against it. Their following has gotten more and more support in recent years and has bolstered the chalav yisrael business substantially.]]></description>
