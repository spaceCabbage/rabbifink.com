		<description><![CDATA[R. Emanuel Feldman provides a religious justification here(and describes his catch at a World Series game):


&quot;.... It was a friendly call from one of my Atlanta congregants. He had World Series tickets; would I like to go with him to the game? &quot;They&#039;re great seats,&quot; he said. &quot;Right behind third base, field level.&quot;

I hesitated, because there are many more important things to do with one&#039;s time. But the sports juices of my youth began to stir within me, and the rationalizations fell quickly into place: It will be a study of Americana in the raw; it will be a moment of relaxation; you have always liked baseball, its non-violence, its patience, the solitary struggle of lonely pitcher against lonely batter. And consider its religious undertones: the goal is to circle the infield and then come back to the starting point, to return to beginnings. Unlike football or basketball, where the clock ultimately runs out, baseball is timeless: a tie game can theoretically continue until eternity....&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Although the letter of the law prohibits only live music, Weil said he personally believes that the sense of camaraderie that comes along with being in a large gathering, such as a baseball game or a fireworks display, &quot;undermines the purpose of the experience&quot; of mourning.&quot;

Perhaps the question is what one would be doing instead.

Similarly, there is the question of sports in general( I am a moderate baseball fan, and attend  2-3 Yankee games a year, but have to ask a fellow fan at the game what place the Yankees are in because I don&#039;t keep up with it daily) .

Mishpacha had an interview with &quot;Davening Dov&quot; Kramer of WFAN radio(reprinted on Matzav): 

&quot;Obviously, all of this begs the question: Is it appropriate for Jewish men and boys to be interested in the professional sports world?

“I actually have a shiur on this, where I relate it to the parah adumah,” Dov remarks. “The upshot is that for people who would otherwise focus on more detrimental things, it’s better for them to follow sports. But if you can use your time more productively, then follow that route. It all depends on who you are.

“The Netziv has a fascinating take on this, which he explains as an underlying conversation between Hashem and Kayin,” he continues. “Kayin was only focused on the necessities of life, while Hevel was conscious of the nicer things in this world that Hashem gave us to enjoy, and took advantage of them. Hashem accepted Hevel’s offering, with the message to Kayin being, ‘If you use the time you would otherwise spend chasing pleasures in a good way, you would be better off; but if you don’t use that time in a constructive way, it will lead you to the doorstep of sin.’” In other words, he concludes, “You’re probably better off following sports than watching television, or sitting around speaking lashon hara, or worse.”

I would add that a benefit of following sports is that it is something that can be used as conversation when speaking to non-Jewish coworkers, or neighbors. I remember reading about a lobbyist from Agudah who deals with government officials  who made this same point.]]></description>
