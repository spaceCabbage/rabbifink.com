		<description><![CDATA[&quot;There is little religious nostalgia for victims&quot;.

I know a married woman who after 18 years of wearing a wig decided to take it off.
She was victimized by &quot;religious abuse&quot; in  front of a Bais Din. As a consequence she decided to take off her wig.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You make a good point that I hadn&#039;t considered before.

I&#039;m a BT, but I still have a lifetime of positive Jewish nostalgia.

My family did shabbat dinner, Pesach seders, going to Reform Temple (not every week, but more than twice a year); and of course, Chanukah.

I have a lifelong positive Jewish identity.  So, once I decided to seek out Truth, I went to Jews who claimed to know Truth first.  (Reform doesn&#039;t even bother claiming that their practices are the True Will of Hashem).

Then again, I know many BT&#039;s and gerim, who had no Jewish content in their childhoods, who are very happy shomrei mitzvot today.

So, nostalgia can help someone take on / keep their mitzvah observance, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s as strong of a factor as a supportive spouse, family, and community in the present.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thoughts outside of faith.
What to do when the &#039;life events&#039; - war, fear of dying in the mix with fear of living. Poverty bordering with starvation. Wild-spread hostility and lies. Impudence. Forbidden books and thinking. Missing in action (presumed dead) invalid-father returns from labor camp...Baggage like that shapes your life for ever. And yet - miraculously you escape such a misfortune. Parents&#039; love and your own love for them rescue you from the dead end and save your soul. Already not young you are in love and you have children. 
How to bridge your such a &#039;life&#039; with the lives of your sons? Isn&#039;t it abusive to mess up with their destiny by &#039;poisoning&#039; them with your memory? Add to that the fact that you do not speak their language until you catch up with them. Love is not a perfect channeling of somebody  else&#039;s life events.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not just that BTs lack nostalgia; we all mostly received a secular education, in which we learned about evolution, were exposed to different cultures, and were specifically NOT taught that any one religious group or subgroup is superior to another.

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder if another word for nostalgia is &quot;momentum&quot;, at least for what you are describing here (keeping people in the fold). And, if you really want to get technical, maybe people using nostalgia to keep themselves inside are simply a subset of orthoprax.


And as far as Baalei Teshuva leaving, I&#039;m not sure that even a hefty dose of nostalgia could cure what ails them. First of all, they&#039;ve made a huge commitment, and a huge lifestyle change that affects all aspects of their life and their relationships. Second of all, the expectations of orthodoxy are quite heavy, including socially, financially, and many other ways. And third, even if they manage the gauntlet successfully, they &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; won&#039;t be accepted as full members of the society. They and their children will primarily be setup with other BT&#039;s (or with various people with other perceived &quot;defects&quot; when it comes to matchmaking), and there will always be a tinge of distrust regarding their &quot;kashrut.&quot;]]></description>
