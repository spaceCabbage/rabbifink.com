IH and I have had long running debates over at Hirhurim. (It&#039;s in the archives if anyone cares to dredge it up.)
But I hope to cut down on blogging- I type with 1 finger and things take forever- so my shtikah shouldn&#039;t be considered a ho&#039;daah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well hello, IH.:

As Eliezer Abrahamson notes on that post:

&quot; My question is what relevance can modern Biblical scholarship have to someone who doesn’t accept the assumptions of the field. I suspect that it can have none. Modern Biblical scholarship does not attack the traditional Jewish perspective, it simply ignores it.&quot;

And Dr Brill&#039;s Reply

&quot;How recent academic scholars of the biblical text use the texts edited in the 20th century to date Biblical texts is the actual topic of discussion. Please use this chance to read a book or two. Find out about the recent edited Ugaritic, Egyptian and Akkadian texts. You can catch yourself up to date by reading the comprehensives summaries. And please try to read and understand his answers about his own work before typing. This is a rare golden opportunity to find out about the last few decades from an expert historian. Professor Berman is seizing this opportunity.Please discuss Carr’s work.
Yes, historical method and Divine assumptions go right past each other- Rabbi Isaac Breuer discussed this almost 80 years ago about 19th century Biblical criticsm. So if one thinks that the Holocaust was a Divine punishment because of the Zionists or anti-Zionists, that Divine causality rightfully has no place in historical causality based on political, social, contextual, or economic causes.&quot;


In other words he agrees with Eliezer Abrahamson&#039;s point, but want&#039;s to have a discussion about how &quot;recent academic scholars of the biblical text use the texts edited in the 20th century to date Biblical texts&quot;  and the &quot;recent edited Ugaritic, Egyptian and Akkadian texts. &quot;
My question is, why should we be interested? 
Also, I&#039;m not sure if you&#039;ve been reading Hirhurim lately- and it may be too late to restart now- but  http://torahmusings.com/2013/07/three-practical-ways-bad-theology-hurts-us/  might be worth reading.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;if they would they would not be following in the traditions of Torah observance. So they would be out.&quot; implies the traditions never change over time. But they do change over time. So who gets to draw the line about which traditions can change and which can&#039;t? All of this &quot;reasoning&quot; feels circular to me. If we found an earlier version of the Torah, and it differed from the current version, then why wouldn&#039;t we follow it? How can we possibly assume the later changes were God&#039;s will? If they are, why didn&#039;t God make sure it was written correctly in the first place?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;What I am trying to say is that if someone has a belief that is not mainstream orthodox or even if it’s an incompatible belief with typical orthodox Judaism it should not matter if that person maintains that the Torah he believes in, however it got there, is as binding as the word of God to Moses.&quot;


Whoa, dangerous stuff there, Rabbi.


If one denies Torah Min Shomayim, the 8th Tennant of Rambam, and keeps 613 Mitzvos based on some self-determination, what is to stop him (or his talmidim) from going one step further and begin picking and choosing mitzvot? Was this not the beginning of Reform and Conservative?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A quote from Alter&#039;s introduction, for flavor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This rapid summary may make matters sound pat, but it fact all the details of the Documentary Hypothesis are continually, and often quite vehemently debated.  [...]  (I should add that efforts to distinguish between J and E on stylistic grounds have been quite unconvincing.)  It is small wonder that the Documentary Hypothesis, whatever its general validity, has begun to look at though it has reached a point of diminishing returns, and many young scholars, showing signs of restlessness with source criticism, have begin exploring other approaches – literary, anthropological, sociological, and so forth – to the Bible.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, the Documentary Hypothesis has mostly been rejected by Bible scholars.  It lives on among those like yourself, who find it a convenient dodge to dealing with the difficult issues.

As previously quoted, Alan Brill sums it up well:

&lt;blockquote&gt;if the religious community wants to respond to Biblical criticism, then  it should know what it is talking about. It has to stop create  homiletics about repetitions and thinking that it answers anything at  all.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure how this is a tarring excercise rather than simply pointing out that&#039;s what he is saying. The man wants to change both hashkafah and halakhah, and call the result Orthodoxy. But then, if I were a tar brusher, objectivity about my own motives would be among the first things to go!

But it&#039;s not an independent discovery, as neither of them discovered anything. They both started out buying into the critic&#039;s assumptions and then said that given those &quot;modern, scientific&quot; assumptions (in a liberal art field? -- thus my scare quotes), a document hypothesis is compelling.

		<description><![CDATA[One cannot fear God&#039;s retribution and greatness simultaneously? 


Are we supposed to assume that a given pasuk can only mean one very specific thing, and each commentator only gets one shot at interpreting it? That&#039;s the only way I see there being a problem here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You seem to be arguing that yirat Hashem and emunat Hashem are not mitzvot in themselves, but simply shorthand to reiterate the obligation to keep the mitzvot in general. I don&#039;t think that that is R&#039; Kamenetsky&#039;s point. He seems to be saying that there are many ways to feel yirat Hashem, and you are obligated in whichever serves best to help you keep the other commandments. Presumably an atheist would not argue that he keeps the commandments out of emunat Hashem, even in an unusual way; he would probably have other reasons for observance. Thus, even if emunat Hashem is as flexible as R&#039; Kamenetsky makes yirat Hashem, the atheist would have a problem.]]></description>

Yeah, I know. It’s still not a question.

&gt; Yes. It is a polemic. And the principle is a principle that is a foundation of Judaism.

I guess I think of principles as starting points, from which you build up the tenets of the religion. Polemics work in the opposite direction. 

&gt; There are other options besides &quot;complete myth&quot; that work with Bib Crit. See: Kugel, James and Farber, R&#039; Zev.

		<description><![CDATA[The contradiction isn&#039;t that they are mutually exclusive.  The contradiction is that in Sefer Hamitzvot, Rambam says that the verse את-ה&#039; אלקיך תירא is a positive commandment to fear god&#039;s retribution. However, in &lt;i&gt; yesodai Hatorah &lt;/i&gt;, Rambam writes (2:1-2): 

Halacha 1

It is a mitzvah to love and fear this &lt;i&gt; glorious and awesome God &lt;/i&gt;, as [Deuteronomy 6:5] states: &quot;And you shall love God, your Lord&quot; and, as [Deuteronomy 6:13] states: &quot;Fear God, your Lord.&quot;

Halacha 2

 What is the path [to attain] love and fear of Him? When a person contemplates His wondrous and great deeds and creations and appreciates His infinite wisdom that surpasses all comparison, he will immediately love, praise, and glorify [Him], yearning with tremendous desire to know [God&#039;s] great name, asDavid stated: &quot;My soul thirsts for the Lord, for the living God&quot; [Psalms 42:3]. 

When he [continues] to reflect on these same matters, he will immediately recoil in awe and fear, appreciating how he is a tiny, lowly, and dark creature, standing with his flimsy, limited, wisdom before He who is of perfect knowledge, as David stated: &quot;When I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers... [I wonder] what is man that You should recall Him&quot; [Psalms 8:4-5].

		<description><![CDATA[Are you saying that chovos halvavos are secondary to chovos ha&#039;eivarim, or altogether ignorable?

I&#039;m not sure I agree with either, I think that the primary point of most mitzvos of action are to create particular attitudes, character traits, and yes, beliefs.

But this post has nothing to do with Zev Farber, who does not assert that his beliefs would leave halakhah unchanged.

&lt;i&gt;In my view, Judaism is essentially a wave that eternally sends the messages of God. However, in order to understand how to apply these messages we must understand how any given halacha or ideal functioned in any given society, particularly the original society, ancient Israel. When we understand this, we can “subtract” the societal elements to see the ideas in their relative purity and reapply them to our times. Waves, however, require continuity. For this reason, it is vital to understand how the Torah functioned in every generation since Moshe in order to do this right. This requires serious study and thought.&lt;/i&gt; (From &lt;a href=&quot;http://thetorah.com/torah-history-judaism-part-4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;part IV&lt;/a&gt;, subsection &quot;The Wave Theory&quot;.)

Farber noticed, as the C movement did, that the logical conclusion of a critical approach to the Torah and treating a sociological study of the history of halakhah as inputs for future decisions, is something other than Orthodox halakhah. This paragraph fits their &quot;Tradition and Change&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for responding. First off, I don&#039;t imagine any thinking atheist would ever say they are &quot;positive there is no God&quot;. The idea of a Transcendent Being is something no one can ever 100% prove or falsify. They just very strongly &quot;don&#039;t believe it&quot; - at least in a God who has expectations of us, answers our prayers, rewards &amp; punishes, etc. The idea strikes them as very, very improbable - so much so that they&#039;re willing to bet their life on it, either by saying outright that they don&#039;t believe in God or by rejecting religion.



But second and more to the point, I&#039;m not sure why &quot;certainty&quot; of one&#039;s beliefs has any bearing on the question I asked. It&#039;s simply whether keeping the mitzvot *itself* demonstrates &quot;emunat Hashem&quot;, entirely irrespective of beliefs. Because unless I&#039;m mistaken, I think that&#039;s what you argued regarding &quot;yirat Hashem&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I understand what you have written here, I can half-agree.

The Torah that we have today is binding.  It doesn&#039;t matter if someone digs up another Dead Sea Scroll that shows an &quot;earlier draft&quot; or what have you.

However, I would say that it&#039;s also obligatory to say that G-d guided the transmission of our mesorah.  That is to say, G-d gave us the Code (Written Torah) and the Decoder Ring (Oral Torah / Mesorah) and it has been our job from Matan Torah until today, to do the decoding work, to arrive at the Law that G-d wants us to continue to learn and practice.

(This also fits the famous &quot;my children have defeated me&quot; i.e. Bnei Yisrael succeeded in decoding, to rely on it above a Bas Kol - which was G-d&#039;s goal for us).

For me, this point is essential; because if our body of practical Jewish law is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; how G-d intends for us to live our lives, I want no part of it.

I only want to do what G-d wants me to do.  I have no interest in following a falsified, concocted, or otherwise flawed version of G-d&#039;s instructions for Klal Yisrael.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; R’ Yaakov Kamenetsky asks a famous question on Rambam. In one place, Rambam says that we are supposed to fear God’s punishment. In another place Rambam says we are supposed to feat the awesomeness of God. Which is it?

The two are not mutually exclusive. What’s the question?

&gt;  R’ Yaakov Weinberg explains that this is really a belief that obligates us to deny the possibilty that there will be a new absolute communication from God. 

In other words, it’s not a principle of faith at all, but a polemic against Christianity and Islam.

&gt; It’s hard to hear how a minor distinction in belief …

It’s not a minor distinction. It undermines the basis for keeping the Torah in the first place. If the Torah isn’t the word of God, then what’s the point?

If one accepts biblical criticism, then you have to accept that the tanach is a compilation of myths. What would make it “binding and the best representation of God’s will?”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,

I like the direction you&#039;re trying to go here. I want to ask if you&#039;d be comfortable extending the point further. If we say that someone who keeps the mitzvot is exhibiting &quot;yirat Hashem&quot;, whether or not - if you examined the person&#039;s thoughts - they actually had a mindset of &quot;fear&quot; per se&quot;... Can&#039;t we also say that someone who keeps the mitzvot is exhibiting &quot;emunat Hashem&quot; (lit. &quot;being faithful&quot;), whether or not they actually had a mindset of &quot;belief&quot; per se? And in this way, could it be possible for someone to be an open atheist and yet be a member of the Orthodox community in good standing?]]></description>
