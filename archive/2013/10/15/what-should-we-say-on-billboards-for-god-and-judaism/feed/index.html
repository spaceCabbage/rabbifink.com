		<description><![CDATA[A few years ago Judith Shulevitz wrote a fascinating book called &lt;i&gt;The Sabbath World&lt;/i&gt; at the end of which she writes about her own observance (p. 212) – “Anyway, I still like the idea of the fully observed Sabbath more than I like observing it”.   This is worth keeping in mind when deliberating on the message.

My own view is that billboard advertising of this type is a complete waste of money.   That said, I would vote for:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;What is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow: this is the whole Torah; 
the rest is the explanation; go and learn&quot;

-Hillel the Elder, circa 30 BCE&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;In other words, I think the Pope is saying that actions are far more important than faith.



Of course, but then why be Catholic or Jewish? Unless you are discussing something else entirely, it seems this is at the heart of what is being discussed in the latest Pew Study. Being good, or doing good is important, but you don&#039;t need to be Jewish for that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;It’s a much more inclusive message than the billboard’s message. I think the Pope’s message will have a greater influence on positive social behavior than a snarky anti-atheist sign. -



This new sign is simply a reaction to what some atheist organizations have done which is put up billboards professing &quot;YHWH, you know it&#039;s a myth.&quot; All these billboards are dumb.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The billboard is clever, but much more aggressive than the atheist equivalents. Atheist advertisements tend to be along the lines of, “There are atheists out there, atheists can be good people, and it’s all right if you’re one, too.” “Thank God you’re wrong.” Is more the typical arrogant religious  stance of we’re right, you’re wrong, and you should believe the same things we do.

R’ Shafran’s proposal is laughable. I saw somewhere a while back the “Captain Kirk test.” If you substitute “Captain Kirk” for “God” in a statement and it’s still compelling, then an atheist will likely consider what you’re saying. If it ends up sounding silly, well, to an atheist, it sounds the same way with “God” still in place. For example:

…being a Jew, like it or not, precious fellow Jew, means being charged by Captain Kirk, that it means shouldering, whether it is always comfortable or not, responsibility ? And that ignoring that mandate is a reckless wasting of an opportunity to live a meaningful life by doing Captain Kirk’s will? …]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you completely that the Pope&#039;s message (although too long to work on a billboard) is better than the snarky type, or Rabbi Shafran&#039;s suggestion. Something along the lines of &quot;Religion - it&#039;s not just for fanatics&quot; might be interesting.
This may be a tangent, but I wonder what you mean when you say Orthodox Judaism isn&#039;t for everyone, but it can be. I&#039;m an active, religious Reform Jew. I don&#039;t see any way that Orthodox Judaism could ever be for me.]]></description>
