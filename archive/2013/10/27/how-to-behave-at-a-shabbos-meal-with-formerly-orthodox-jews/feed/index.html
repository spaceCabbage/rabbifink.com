		<description><![CDATA[It’s not a question of whether Rav Twersky&#039;s premise is true or false.  It’s just that his posture speaks to the impossibility of his even hearing the small voices of people who have left or want to leave or don’t believe or practice.  He’s lobbing bombs and taking no prisoners.  And he’s doing it because he is a praetorian guard for yiddishkeit.  When he says that stuff, he feels the presence of his father and his father’s father over his shoulder.  No way no how he’s going to debate anyone on the topic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry but there is no such thing as a formerly orthodox Jew. Once a Jew - always a Jew. One may stray from the derech but that does not disqualify one from the club. Even if one is never observant but born to an Orthodox woman, one is always an Orthodox Jew! 

Now the question begs, &quot;How does a frum yid deal with an anti-jewish orthodox Jew?&quot; My answer is &quot;Gently!&quot; and avoid the term goy at all costs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is true that psychiatrists should not &quot;evaluate,&quot; much less diagnose, patients without first-hand examination.  But he is no less entitled to generalization about what motivates people than the rest of us.  Kkaplan&#039;s &quot;diagnosis,&quot; that Rabbi Twersky is &quot;full of himself,&quot; isn&#039;t any more defensible; it&#039;s merely an ad hominem at best. 

I am sure Rabbi Twersky could defend himself on this point, and has done so, but your general point is well taken, though not the extent of its generality.  By which I mean, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s any empirical basis before us on which to assert that people who have been observant, and are not any more, constitute &quot;a group of people who&#039;ve typically gone through a great deal of introspection and pain.&quot;  Maybe you know all 1% of the people who have done so, so you think they&#039;re typical.  Maybe 94% have done so; I don&#039;t know.


We would agree, however, that it&#039;s not 100% -- either in your direction or Rabbi Twersky&#039;s.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R. Twerski prefaces his words with &quot;most often, a person who doubts...&quot;, implying that the intellect can, at least  sometimes, play a role. 

On page 141 of “Religious Compulsions and Fears”, which has a  foreword by Rabbi Abraham J. Twerski, Dr. Avigdor Boncheck writes,

“…As we grow up, we begin to be aware of other perspectives on many life issues…it is for this reason that the Rambam wrote Moreh Nevuchim…so investigating and questioning one’s faith is a natural stage into developing into a faithful believer in Torah and Judaism.”



One can try to  distinguish between questioning, skepticism, and leaving observance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re splitting hairs. So it&#039;s not that they have an overwhelming desire they can&#039;t control. It&#039;s even worse: they could control themselves, but they don&#039;t want to bother.


Again, very few people go  OTD because they don&#039;t want to keep kashrus or Shabbos. If that plays a role at all, it&#039;s after they&#039;ve already become fed up with the community, or lost their faith, already see keeping kosher as a meaningless restriction, and decide to ditch it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rav Twerski is not speaking to those who left .  He’s smart enough to know he would never want to dialogue with them as they represent a potent threat to the closed system required to keep frumkeit from foundering on intellectual grounds.

He is trying to shame and discourage those who are thinking of going off the derech from doing so, or even having a prolonged encounter with ex-haredim (or non haredim.)  He is speaking as a rabbi/leader, not a reasoning psychiatrist.

I’m sure for every defector in the old Soviet Union – the ones who got out to see for themselves whether communism was “obviously true and superior, and the West decadent and materialistic and classist” – there was a Rav Twerski type leader who vilified them to the remaining prisoner-citizens.

It’s an emotionally manipulative kind of response. I’m sure he believes it is warranted.]]></description>

Can you provide some &quot;kosher&quot; book examples for a frum person like the one asking the question in Hamodia (i.e. not slifkin, and what about questions as to mesorah etc.?)? And there are of course many questions without answers, maybe you should tweak your language o make clear that its ok to have questions without good answers?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is a shame R. Twersky doesn&#039;t take the opportunity to discuss the meta-issue of hyper-ideological personalities.  The rule of thumb I use in most real-life interactions these days is to avoid substantive discussion of polarizing topics (whether politics or religion) with ideologues who can only see that topic in black and white terms.   On the other hand, I very much enjoy discussing these issues with people &quot;on the other side&quot; but who operate in full color.  Indeed, that is the way I learn.

To turn R. Twersky&#039;s observation on it&#039;s head: when does obsession with feeling commanded, especially to stricture, become psychologically unhealthy?]]></description>

The rule of thumb I use in most real-life interactions these days is to avoid substantive discussion of polarizing topics (whether politics or religion) with ideologues who can only see that topic in black and white terms.   On the other hand, I very much enjoy discussing these issues with people &#8220;on the other side&#8221; but who operate in full color.  Indeed, that is the way I learn.</p>
<p>To turn R. Twersky&#8217;s observation on it&#8217;s head: when does obsession with feeling commanded, especially to stricture, become psychologically unhealthy?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Great article! The reasons why people go off the derech are many. Many times it has not so much to do with the person wanting to escape all the restrictions of frum life; but rather that personal situations have changed. We tend to downplay the all encompassing influence that the community imparts upon members of the frum community. If a situation puts you at odds with the community (not Judaism), then you may find yourself fighting a one-man (or woman) war. Some choose not to engage and instead just opt out.


I would shy away from such discussions anyway. It could be far too hurtful and remind the person of the life they lost. Or it can upset them and make them angry. Either way there is little to gain from it and a lot to lose.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;In his opinion, the real reason anyone leaves orthodox Judaism is because they want to be able to do anything and everything without restrictions. It’s a matter of self-control, not theology. He is blinded by his desires and thus cannot engage in critical thinking.&lt;/i&gt;

It&#039;s the same pitiful argument put forth by evangelical apologists. Fundamentalists are all tiresomely the same. And this man is a psychiatrist - yeah, I&#039;d want to consult someone with such deep insight into the human condition.]]></description>
