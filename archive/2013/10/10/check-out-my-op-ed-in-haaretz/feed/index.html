		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re missing a fundamental moral problem.  When it comes to custody, there is a legal process that can be used to appeal.  If a woman refuses a man a Get, there is a legal process that can be used to appeal.  If a man refuses a woman a Get, there is no legal process for appeal.  And, sometimes there is not even a ransom she can pay -- it can be entirely for spite (which was the case for a friend of my mother&#039;s, now in her 80s).  It is evil.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe not comparable, but often intimately connected (see case 1 below).

Seems to me that there are 3 main reasons why a get is withheld:
1. The man feels wronged (divorce agreement, custody, visitation, etc) and feels that this is his only remaining leverage.
2. The man is attempting to extort [more] money from the family.
3. The man is a psychopath/sociopath and enjoys harming people, specifically people who cross him, like his wife who left him.


For guys who fall into category 2 and 3, I wouldn&#039;t cry too hard if they were beaten until they willingly give the get. For case 1, well, it would depend on the circumstances.

Custody is *determined* in family court, but it isn&#039;t *enforced* by family court. It is only enforced by having sufficient money to pay a lawyer to repeatedly petition for your rights. But it isn&#039;t just custody/visitation itself that is the issue, a closed community has a much higher success rate in reinforcing &quot;alienation of affection&quot; between the kids and the spouse with less power within the community. 



And in the end, I bet a large percentage of agunot are agunot because they are the ones with less power (for example ones that cannot afford to pay $60k to beat up their ex). For example, guy is a respected doctor, a donor, and has deep ties to the community, while the ex-wife was from outside the community and doesn&#039;t have strong ties to it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Rabbis arrested are no &quot;knights in shining armor&quot;. 
They repeatedly harassed someone I know- without ever asking him his side of the story, without asking the Beis Din the case was in front of (she didnt like how it was going and just called up this Rabbi), without finding out anything except HER story. He was scared he was going to be stalked and beat up in an alley somewhere- he was afraid to go out alone at points! He went out with a friend just to hopefully deter any assaults!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And what about the numerous cases where the woman:
1. Refuses to accept the Get. I know several cases where this happened. It was given from a real Beis Din that is well-known and prominent, no money was required as &quot;payment&quot;, and there were no other conditions.
2. Refuses to let her ex-husband see the children (multiple ages) at all. She goes against any agreement made or any visitation scheduled, making up reasons why the kids cannot come over. (&quot;She has a play date&quot;- don&#039;t schedule it for the father&#039;s time then! Do it for the following day.) He never hurt the children and the children enjoy spending time with their father. They ask to come over and are upset when its &quot;Mommy&#039;s Shabbos again&quot;. 

3. The woman tried sending thugs out to hurt/harass the man when he offered to give the get! The thugs never asked the Beis Din what the true story was and they still severely beat up the husband. He ended up in the ER.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand that it&#039;s a thorny issue, but to me, what takes away from &quot;complicated intersection of religious and domestic law&quot; and into RICO is the money.  &quot;Kofin oto&quot; has halachic roots.  But, like MarkSoFla says, there are steps and checks in place to make sure that it&#039;s the last resort and it&#039;s done properly.  Extorting desperate women for tens of thousands of dollars is vile.  Or, giving women a way to pay around a situation where kofin oto *isn&#039;t* proper and would never be sanctioned by a Bet Din is even worse.  I understand and agree with your sympathy for agunot, without reservation. But what if there were women who were not agunot.

		<description><![CDATA[Sooner or later, we will be back to R. Rackman&#039;s proposal as there has been no better answer within the halachic process.  By way of tutorial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The solution Rackman proposed was a form of retroactive marital annulment, based on the model of the ‘mistaken sale’ – monetary transactions annulled for lack of full disclosure by one of the parties. Since in marriage, as in sales, full consent is required by both parties, the withholding of information by one is considered to compromise the other’s consent. ‘Concealing an important fact in selling a piece of property can justify the annulment of the sale. The same argument can be applied with regard to a marriage.’” The Talmud recognized the logic of this argument and would have allowed it to be the basis of annulments and saving an &lt;i&gt;aguna&lt;/i&gt;, but disallowed it on another ground: “the general presumption that women prefer any marriage at all to being alone,” even to a leper or an abusive husband.

“Rackman proposed an appropriation of this logic of annulment, with a critical amendment in its application based on an updated presumption about women’s preferences.” Rackman “acknowledged that the mind-set of preferring a bad marriage to no marriage may have been common among Talmudic women” for the woman who was left alone was lost in the society of the times and perhaps even in danger. But, Rackman “concluded simply, ‘In our day it is no longer true.’” A presumption, called &lt;i&gt;hazaka&lt;/i&gt; in Hebrew, is in the Jewish legal system a prediction about nature, in this case, human nature. However, this presumption is outdated and should be ignored and the “mistaken purchase” annulment should stand as the solution to the terrible problem of the “chained wife”.

Unfortunately, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik nixed Rabbi Rackman’s argument in 1975 and thereby, Rabbi Hartman writes, not only harmed the all-to-many chained wives but also placed Judaism in suspended animation. Rabbi Soloveitchik was then and is still today considered an accepted authority on Jewish law among Modern Orthodox Jews. He was, of course, entitled to his opinion, and his view should be respected, but should Judaism follow it when it does so much harm? Aren’t Jews today violating the Torah laws of love and respect of others when they fail to act? Can’t a solution be found that complies with halakha?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[A. Mazal Tov on getting published in ha&#039;Aretz pretty prestigious publication.
B. I read the PDF. I think our piece brings balance and nuance to the issue.  Many outlets are painting those arrested in the FBI sting as mercenaries in it for big bucks but I think that you &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; probably comes closer to the truth in most cases.
