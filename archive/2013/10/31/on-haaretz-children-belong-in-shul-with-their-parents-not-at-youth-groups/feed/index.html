		<description><![CDATA[My shul has an issue. many women stay home with little ones or come much later. What about girls ages 8 - 11 who want to come to shul earlier but have no one to sit with in the ezras nashim? We created a &quot;Cocoa Club&quot; for them to be able to come earlier with their fathers, socialize a bit and then spend supervised time davening in the ezras nashim with a madricha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For parents of small children, we have available in the sanctuary canvas bags with picture books, coloring books &#038; crayons, and etch-a-sketch-like toys, so the kids can be with their parents and hear the prayers and singing, without being disruptive. I would think at least the picture books would work in an Orthodox shul where writing isn&#039;t allowed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I grew up in Rabbi Fink&#039;s shul (before his time, I am 29), Pacific Jewish Center. We came to shul every shabbos from a young age, walked 1.5 miles to get there, and sat nicely with our father for most of davening. We were capable of sitting, and not running around or talking and playing noisily. Many other children of members did the same. Our parents would let us have breaks, but other than that we sat through the whole davening. Why aren&#039;t children able to do it these days? Bad parenting? Changes in environment?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I attended the Young Israel of Brownsville and East Flatbush when I was young. We had youth services, grades 3-8, during the regular prayers. There, we learned how to lead services, read Torah and Haftorah, and even give a d&#039;var Torah. After Services, we joined the regular congregation for the closing hymns, which WE led. When I entered YU HS, we had a teenage minyan, as well. And every few months, we took over in the main sanctuary and led and read and chanted and sermonized. It was a hothouse of Judaism for a brief moment -- some 6 years -- of my life, 1962-68. No other shul I ever davvened in had that kind of atmosphere for the younger generation, sad to say. But THOSE years? They were geshmack!


Of course, that is nostalgia -- nostos algos in Greek, meaning &quot;the sickness of homecoming, memory.&quot; Maybe things are different today -- everything else has changed, so why not youth groups. Rav Fink, let us see the FULL article, so we can know fully whereof you speak, ok? Kol Tuv.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a fine line.  On the one hand, shul should be a family experience.  On the other hand, few children, particularly small ones, can sit still that long.  Additionally, they are often too young to understand what is going on.  This can lead to disruptive behaviors such as running around, talking or playing noisily, or tantrumming.  All of this is disruptive to the service and the other congregants.]]></description>
