		<description><![CDATA[Thanks. I was about to note too that this last sentence boils down to &quot;they&#039;re overly emotional and biased, they&#039;re fact checkers&quot;. Really?



You can&#039;t motivate people into being honest lest they get reported when they could be honest AND get reported anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On Facebook you used the term &#039;whistle-blower&#039; which is quite a different thing than fact-checker, and certainly more apt. 

When Mark Felt revealed himself as Deep Throat, some commentators noted how it somewhat cheapened what he did: He went from being a noble anonymous source battling evil and corruption at significant risk  (fact-checker) to a guy who ratted out his boss because he was passed over for a job (whistle-blower). The objective truth of what he did was unchanged, but the subjective appearance changed significantly as an ulterior motive came to the fore. 

J-Blogosphere fails the appearance test on virtually every level. &#039;Keeping the man honest&#039; is important, being a shrill back-bench peanut-chucker is not. Politifact proves you can do one without the other. J-Blogosphere serves more as a circular echo chamber from my perspective. Were Rabbinic leadership routinely lying pre-2004? Did blogs suddenly change that? If the earth moved from beneath my feet, I must have missed it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Then it is a metaphor for failure. 

&quot;The voice of the J-Blogosphere can be confusing, annoying, angry, cynical, unpopular, and negative. But it also serves the very important purpose of fact checkers.&quot;

Fact checkers aren&#039;t any of those adjectives. You would never describe Politifact as such. They go out of their way to NOT appear angry or cynical. I think you&#039;re illustrating the gap between how you perceive the J-Blogosphere and what it actually is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The study also shows the efficacy of a known fact-checker with a reputation for factiness over more general watch notices. Politifact also deals in an area where factuality is relatively easy to determine.
