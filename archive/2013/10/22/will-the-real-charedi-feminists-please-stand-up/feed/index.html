		<description><![CDATA[1) What makes her Chareidi?

2)  She&#039;d be better off starting her own party. Chances are that a Chareidsi party with a woman on it will get less votes than one with. This reminds me of the attempt to egalitarian-ize  Kol Berama. http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/article.php?p=108187  
The CEO of KB had this to say:
 &quot;I am a devout secularist, not shomer Shabbos but a businessman seeking to
 earn a living so I will not be addressing Halacha here, but business, 
which is what my interest is. Quite honestly, I will say that I have not
 seen any Halacha that permits women to go on the air, but I have seen 
laws saying they cannot. I personally would love for them to show me 
that it is permitted in accordance with Halacha.

As a businessman I must address my clients, in this case, the 
chareidi tzibur. According to a number of polls, including TGI, it is 
clear, that listeners don’t want to hear females on the radio. If they 
do, they will listen to other stations. At present, Kol Berama is the 
5th regional radio station of the Second Authority and we are looking to
 continue climbing, not dropping.

We were told by the Second Authority that “at times you have to be 
smart, not correct” so we created the one-hour slot. We hoped few would 
be listening, realizing it would hurt us among our audience, which it 
did. We received many complaints following the program&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand your point about feeling conflicted with calling orthodox Judaism feminist, but i think you miss the point that these communities hold, and that is men and women are different but equal, and if not equal the Woman;s role is more important and should (not necessarily is) be held in a higher regard.  That is the argument i have always hear, not saying i agree or disagree with it, but it should be noted as the context for the argument.   I do agree with you that the traditional liberal notion of Feminism is that women should be able to do everything men can do, without limitation, and therefore this is not that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the broader issue of Feminism and Orthodoxy, R, Sperber made an interesting observation in a recent Ha&#039;aretz interview (http://www.haaretz.com/misc/article-print-page/.premium-1.550190 ) emphasis mine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“This is why I’ve always suggested that partnership minyanim work best with new congregations founded by men and women of like minds, &lt;i&gt;usually men who have studied in modern hesder yeshivas [whose students combine religious studies with service in the Israel Defense Forces] and women who are graduates of michlalot [colleges for Orthodox women, in this context]&lt;/i&gt;, who feel a spiritual need to do this,” he says, “not in established congregations, where they are likely to create conflict.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>
