		<description><![CDATA[That might be true for STAM rationality.
&quot;Rational Judaism&quot; is something totally different. It means taking leave of all the fairy tales of old: shedim, talmudic refuos, geocentricity, lack of historicity &#038; all the things which &quot;must have a deeper meaning which we don&#039;t understand now &#038; we&#039;ll NEVER grasp&quot;. 
It is not that we became smarter. True, we became more knowledgeable.
But the most important part is the following:

		<description><![CDATA[I hope you continue with this topic, but get past the dogmatic rhetoric of both sides.  As the physicist Freeman Dyson has written in the NYRB:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The public has a distorted view of science, because children are taught in school that science is a collection of firmly established truths. In fact, science is not a collection of truths. It is a continuing exploration of mysteries. Wherever we go exploring in the world around us, we find mysteries. Our planet is covered by continents and oceans whose origin we cannot explain. Our atmosphere is constantly stirred by poorly understood disturbances that we call weather and climate. The visible matter in the universe is outweighed by a much larger quantity of dark invisible matter that we do not understand at all. The origin of life is a total mystery, and so is the existence of human consciousness. We have no clear idea how the electrical discharges occurring in nerve cells in our brains are connected with our feelings and desires and actions.  Even physics, the most exact and most firmly established branch of science, is still full of mysteries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also has another fascinating essay in which he recounts his friendship with Velikovsky, in which he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt; Why do I value so highly the memory of Eddington and Velikovsky, and why does Margaret Wertheim treasure the memory of William Thomson and Jim Carter? We honor them because science is only a small part of human capability. We gain knowledge of our place in the universe not only from science but also from history, art, and literature. Science is a creative interaction of observation with imagination. “Physics at the Fringe” is what happens when imagination loses touch with observation. Imagination by itself can still enlarge our vision when observation fails. The mythologies of Carter and Velikovsky fail to be science, but they are works of art and high imagining. As William Blake told us long ago, “You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a little confused. You said &quot;It’s true that this sort of thinking led many people to conclusions that we would reject today. Rambam himself was of the belief that God’s existence is provable. Rambam also thought Aristotelian philosophy and science were as true as God’s word in the Torah. We know that both of these are actually untrue. &quot; If you are saying that God&#039;s existence is not provable and that Rationalist thought tends to not believe in things supernatural that cannot be proven, shouldn&#039;t Rationalist thought tend to not believe in God? Doesn&#039;t it seem that the Rambam believed in God because he thought it was provable - implying he would not believe if it was not provable? 

One could say he believes anyway, but that wouldn&#039;t be in the Rationalist derech anymore.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;R’ Samson Raphael Hirsch wrote Horeb, a book of the philosophy of mitzvos without a single kabbalistic reference. The entire book makes sense of Torah Judaism and it all works even if one rejects mysticism.&quot;

Interestingly,  RSRH used notes from the Zohar to prepare Horeb. From Rabbi Danziger&#039;s review of Rabbi Elias&#039; &quot;Nineteen Letters&quot; in the Summer, 1996 Jewish Action:

&quot;Rav Hirsch&#039;s critical attitude to kabbalah, or as Dayan Grunfeld prefers to term it, &quot;this guarded attitude&quot;(Introduction to Horeb), has in the interest of &quot;ideological correctness&quot; been reinterpreted apologetically by Jakob Rosenheim and Dayan Grunfeld, who are followed by Rabbi Elias. The apologia runs as follows:

1. Rav Hirsch does, after all, acknowledge kabbalah as &quot;an invaluable repository of the spirit of Tanach and Talmud.&quot;

2. We find in Rav Hirsch&#039;s writings echoes of and parallels to ideas from kabbalistic literature.

3. Preparatory notes for Horeb indicate that Rav Hirsch made use of the Zohar.

4. It is said that his personal siddur contained marginal notes of a kabbalistic nature.

Therefore, the explanation of Rav Hirsch&#039;s attitudeis, in the words of Dayan Grunfeld (Introduction to Horeb), that &quot;Hirsch was concerned with the ethical side of Jewish symbolism and not its mystical side ... His ethical symbolism did not exclude the possibility of a mystical symbolism which holds that every mitzvah has also a cosmic significance and that the effect of a commandment observed reaches to the remotest ramifications of the universe.&quot;


...A non-apologetic reading of Rav Hirsch&#039;s words in Letter Eighteen about kabbalah will indicate that Rav Hirsch is referring to two opposing, rather than complementary, approaches - the ethical, on the one hand, and the mystical, extramundane on the other. He is not complaining that the ethical does not complement the extramundane. His complaint is that the proper understanding of kabbalah should have been ethical, not extramundane. No amount of apologetics can get around the hard fact that Rav Hirsch calls the extramundane worlds of(what is in his opinion) &quot;misconstrued&quot; kabbalah &quot;external dream-worlds.&quot;  &quot;

		<description><![CDATA[Your first paragraph cuts to the chase.  The halachic rulings in ToShBa are human law (Lo Ba’Shamyim Hi) that we accept despite knowing that they are based on a worldview that is not “Rationalist”.   Some argue that Rambam tried to supersede all the messiness of ToShBa with his Mishneh Torah, but we still study the Talmud – including the Aggadah that often informs the Halacha – and it is indisputably the basis of Rabbinic Judaism as we continue to practice it.  So what is the methodology by which “Rationalist Judaism” decides how to cope with all that Aggadic messiness in the Talmud that includes both supernatural phenomena and bad science?  Saying ~”yeah, it’s broken; but, that’s what we do anyway”~ may make people feel good, but it’s not very intellectually satisfying.    Particularly with something as relatively innocuous as putting Worcestershire Sauce on a steak.  It seems to me a gap worth exploring.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;&#062; But no matter how one practices their Judaism, it is wise to establish both views as viable options.


Agreed - but I think it deserves mention that currently it&#039;s only the rationalist approach which is being billed as nonviable (i.e. heretical) - by the Haredi Orthodox establishment. The mystical approach - while it may be derided by some - is under no similar systematic assault. And I also think R. Slifkin deserves a mention here - as well as kudos, since he&#039;s placed himself on the front lines in the battle to maintain the viability of the rationalist approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The idea that God intended for a specific Halachic ruling bothers me, somewhat. It seems contrary to the entire doctrine of &quot;lo bashomayim hi,&quot; especially as outlined in the Oven of Akhnai story. Rationalist Judaism as a system of Torah interpretation does not have as much of a problem with Chazal&#039;s mysticism as you want to make it seem: Halacha is, like all other systems, a process of legal development. We adhere to judicial precedent because that&#039;s part of how the system works. A law based on a mystical rationale is still the law; until a majority of Rabbinic scholars (or a Beit Din!) overrules it, then that decision is the Halacha.


Most Orthodox authorities (Modern included) are loathe to simply overrule an old decision just because we&#039;ve learned something new for a variety of reasons. The rationalist-legalistic one is simple: what if we discover something new and contrary to our currently held beliefs tomorrow, requiring additional legal revisions? The procedures for developing Halacha is intentionally slow and steady to ensure that we maintain consistency and continuity in the Law. And there is nothing wrong with that.


This position will inevitably lead to a discussion about the Open Orthodox movement, which we can talk about if you want.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was not implying you were arguing about authenticity; I was observing a further point on the debate you are discussing.

The Talmud as a corpus is supernaturalist rather than rationalist.  And I disagree about your question of &quot;necessary belief&quot;.  Even if it is not a necessary belief (and I do not think it is), it is inherent in the decision making.  The argument that they got to the right conclusion via a mistaken process is unconvincing to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The question is not whether the supernatural was part of Chazal&#039;s existence. The question is why? Was it because it&#039;s a necessary belief? Or was it just part of their general worldview? And Chazal is not a monolith. As you have seen some were more supernaturalist than others.


This article does not argue that one side is authentic and the other is not. So that&#039;s a red herring.


The answer to your question on authority was obliquely answered in the article, but I will do a more comprehensive article on it in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is my first cycle reading Daf Yomi, but starting with Br’achot 3a and as recently as Yoma 21a it is plainly evident that supernaturalism was part-and-parcel of Rabbinic Judaism from its beginnings and that Rambam’s philosophic approach was a Chiddush.   As for Rambam, Prof. Kellner has the best line: “Maimonides did not expect to meet many of his rabbinic contemporaries in the world to come.”

The problem with the debate from my perspective is that it has become tortured to the point of sillyness – by both sides – arguing that theirs is the authentic approach; rather than simply acknowledging that present-day modern Orthodoxy is a synthesis of both approaches with individuals clustering toward either the rationalist side or the mystical side.

Finally, an observation I made on Harry Maryles’s blog last week:

If you believe that God delegated authority to Chazal -- something we believe only based on what Chazal self-referentially assert -- is it really credible to have so many instances in which they erred on physical facts, thereby potentially putting their rulings in disrepute?

ToShBa consists both of Aggada and Halacha. You can’t just accept the Halacha part without finding a way to live with the Aggada part. R. Meiselman appears to offer a fundamentalist methodology that responds to the issue, but I have not seen a coherent methodology from the self-declared Rationalists regarding how they decide what to accept from Chazal and what to discard.]]></description>
