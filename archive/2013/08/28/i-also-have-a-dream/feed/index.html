		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;So, 98% of the time we do see eye to eye on who is under the chuppa.&lt;/i&gt;


The orthodox disagree with reform weddings MUCH more than 2%!!!


* All the ones with a female rabbi, probably close to 50% by now (or will be pretty soon).
* All the ones with a halachically non-Jewish partner, probably a goodly percentage by now.
* All second marriages without an halachically valid get.
* All same sex marriages, I agree that this is a tiny number and can be ignored.


And RW orthodox probably disagree with nearly all of them just based on the mode of dress (which has become a major fetish for RW Jews).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;No, sorry, you are wrong about what Reform Jews believe about education.&lt;/i&gt;

What percentage of reform Jews attend reform day schools? (and how many such day schools even exist in the first place?)

What percentage of orthodox Jews attend orthodox day schools?

The difference between those two percentages is vast and is the primary indication of how each of those populations act with regard to Jewish education.

&lt;i&gt;Your statement that we think &quot;hardly any&quot; time should be spent on Jewish subjects is inaccurate and insulting.&lt;/i&gt;



I&#039;m sorry I insulted you, that wasn&#039;t my intent. Perhaps I shouldn&#039;t have used the word &quot;believe&quot; as I was speaking more to &lt;i&gt;practice&lt;/i&gt; rather than &lt;i&gt;principle&lt;/i&gt;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But it isn&#039;t really different from what Mark said. Sure, you have Jewish education. But what kind? Do you think the type of Jewish education they are receiving is something an OJ would want to invest in? Or vice versa. Do you think a Reform Jew cares to invest his time and energy into the type of education that OJ gives by teaching TMS and Talmud is God&#039;s word and that every Jew must keep all the mizvot? The fact that you stuck in the word &quot;Jewish&quot; before &quot;education&quot; does not mean you would see any cooperation between the two.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, sorry, you are wrong about what Reform Jews believe about education. The building next to the Reform congregation I attend has a Jewish day school that teaches Jewish subjects every day - not just on Sunday, and not just until age 13. Many of those kids are our congregants. For those who don&#039;t send their kids to Jewish day school, we have an active youth program that runs through high school. Your statement that we think &quot;hardly any&quot; time should be spent on Jewish subjects is inaccurate and insulting.]]></description>

Of course, there are many more.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;We might disagree on specifics but those are not vital to cooperation.&lt;/i&gt;


Really? Sometimes specifics are a huge barrier to cooperation. Take the education example you provided. While we agree that education is a good thing, us orthodox Jews believe that half the day should be spent on Judaics and half on secular subjects. Reform Jews believe that hardly any of the day should be spent on Judaics and that it should mostly relegated to Sundays, and for most people only though age 13 or so. So there goes cooperation regarding education, we can&#039;t even attend the same schools! Though I agree that there are other forms of cooperation regarding education, in the end, if it relates to Judaism, there will always be some sort of problem (separate/mixed gender classes, teaching females to lein, having women teach Judaics, the requirements of religious practice, food suitability, what can and cannot be included in the curriculum, etc).]]></description>

So what kind of &quot;Jewish experience&quot; are we really building? Are we really a global community if we don&#039;t share things that are fundamentally Jewish?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course there are things that we all agree on, but what does that have to do with a Jewish experience? Don&#039;t murder? Don&#039;t steal? Is that the 96.3% that we agree on? 


Lets take a big issue that just happened and I am sure you are aware of. Rabbi Wolpe came out to accept Same-sex marriage. His halachic justification was &quot;kevod habriot.&quot; Now, I was there for his lectures on homosexuality in Judaism. He comes out incredibly thoughtful and nuanced. Some in the audience were not as it immediately got into demonization of anyone that is against same-sex marriage. R&#039; Wolpe tried to immediately squash such knee-jerk reactions. Nonetheless, he has agreed with the Conservative psak that is pro same sex marriage within the movement. This has put another wedge in the divide between the factions.  Just like OJ psak affects pragmatic values, so does Conservative psak affects values. So now, the issue of marriage is not something agree upon. 


So again, what exactly is that &quot;Jewish experience&quot; that we can all agree upon? (let alone 96.3%)]]></description>

Charedim say that there are no common values, just Torah values.

Eli, what comprises the 96.3% Jewish things that we agree upon? Don&#039;t murder. Etc. Is it 96.3% of the 613 mitzvot? Of all the mitzvot including d&#039;rabbanan? What exactly does it comprise?]]></description>

&#062;One day, all Jews, no matter their belief in God, Torah M’Sinai, or the Afterlife will work together to provide positive Jewish experiences for our communities.



That is really the crux no? If group A believes in TMS and group B doesn&#039;t believe in God, then their values will reflect that and often times are very different. So what kind of &quot;Jewish experience&quot; can we work together to provide?]]></description>
