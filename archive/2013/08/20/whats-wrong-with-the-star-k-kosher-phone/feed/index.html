		<description><![CDATA[That doesn&#039;t show anything. Nobody thinks they should impose every halacha or chumra there is along the entire chain of distribution. 


We just think there is some extent to which a kashrus agency should avoid putting their name on something that embarrasses them. 


You seem to be claiming there is NO scenario where they should care about anything but kashrus, so we put to you: Are you opposed to a kashrus agency refusing to certify the food in a brothel?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi I normally agree with your views and this time is no different. they should stay out of this or any other non-food issue. However in regards to the issue of restrictions on food establishments,  it is a bit of a slippery slope. I agree with you that on first instinct a kashrus organization should stick to simply: kosher food or not. However since the concept of kosher is a religious concept, there is an inherent association between the agency and religion and that association can have a spillover effect. Just like any agency or public figure beds to protect its image, a kashrus organization is no different.  Therefore they tend to get cagey when approving a venue that will have &quot;questionable&quot; or uncomfortable activity. if I may cite an exaggerated example to put this in perspective: say a strip club was seeking a hechsher, would we say just stick to the facts, kosher food or not?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wait a second - can these phones make calls on shabbos!?!?  If I were in the hashgacha-selling business, I would only certify phones that can&#039;t be used from sunsets on Friday through motzei shabbos (Rabeinu Tam).  And yomtov.  Maybe the phone could call 911 if the phone could verify that the call was absolutely necessary for pikuach nefesh.  Otherwise, is it really fair to call this a kosher phone?  As they say in yiddish, a phone that can make calls on shabbos is nisht a kosher phone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. Why are you conflating this with the restaurant issue, when it is completely different? If you don&#039;t want a kosher phone, don&#039;t buy one. The main complaint I&#039;ve heard with restaurants is that they force you to accept other morals in exchange for agreeing to make your food kosher, which does not apply here in any way. 

2.  You seem to think Star-k is a &quot;kashrus business&quot;. That isn&#039;t correct, they are the main communal arm of the baltimore community, and their services range from providing shidduch incentives for setting up people from baltimore to buying ambulances for hatzala, to funding the beis din. http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-STAR-KAwardsGrantBCKCBMF.htm Your argument that &quot;they should stick to food&quot; is thus wholly ignoring the nature of the organization. You should do more research. 



3. The only cognizable issue you raise--in passing--is that calling it &quot;kosher&quot; implies it is min hadin and not a chumrah. You are assuming they agree with you that it is only a chumrah, but you fail to state that explicitly, and I don&#039;t know if that premise is correct. In any event, the star-k and every kashrus org incorporates many chumrahs into their food certification also, so I don&#039;t know why you are so mad specifically about the phone. 


4. The most innocuous explanation is that these phones have been called &quot;kosher phones&quot; in the common vernacular for 10 years now. It is simply the generic term; you should recognize that while you jump all over them for it.  


5. Even on the actual restaurant issue, your objection comes across as not very considered. Would you really give a kashrus hashgacha to a strip-club or a beis zonah in states that allow that? I assume you would not. So why the strident tone--why not just disagree on what you actually disagree about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ze-ev Smason - if that is indeed your real name, because its as meaingful to me as DF is to you:
1) I am familiar with the Bangladesh building story, and read about it in the WSJ when it happened. Nothing about it changes anything I wrote.
2) On an internet forum, you should not resort to snide &quot;sic&quot; asides and attempting to cast aspersions based upon one&#039;s internet handle. It makes one look trivial.
3) Who are you to dictate to the belly dancers (taking your claim of familiarity with the alleged story at face value) how they can earn their livelihood? Are you going to step up and pay them for the money they would have earned had their show not been cancelled?  
Look, all of the above is just messing around.  The bottom line is this: Do you have a problem with rabbis granting or declining a hechsher based on anything other than food? If that&#039;s all right with you, then ain hachi nami, then you can go give your shtempel based upon someone&#039;s conception of &quot;equality.&quot; Just bear in mind that no matter who you are, and literally no matter what you do or dont do for a living or for enjoyment, plenty of people will find ethical flaws in YOU too. Presumably you wouldnt want to lose your livelihood because of someone else&#039;s moral judgment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[what the farmer does has direct influence on the end-product, the food. so we can argue it changes the status. the tefillin, non-declared income or clothes of any of the other mentioned persons has nothing to do with the food itself (does not change taste, texture, ingredients, etc). so it should not change the status.

what is the reason that (historically) we do not give a hechsher to a restaurant where the owner was not careful in other halachot e.g. in tzniut? because we fear he might not be careful with the halachot of kashrut as well. this can not be an issue in a muddy area such as tzniut where there are hundreds of valid standards and most of it is minhag. also in Israel where hechsher means customers, we can argue with &#039;professional integrety&#039; like we do e.g. for bishul akum - anybody can be trusted to be careful if his livelihood depends on it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The tragedy is: If Orthodox Jews of a certain mindset were to walk into a restaurant and see servers wearing shorts, they&#039;d walk right out of the place, and follow up by complaining to the management, to the Kosher certifying agency, and to whichever community organ&#039;s &quot;Reader&#039;s Write&quot; column they can reach.


If, however, they see a kosher restaurant with striking workers outside decrying a management that pays sub-minimum wage, confiscates tips, demands 12 hour shifts with no work-guarantees, and is regularly late with wage-payment . . .  They&#039;ll yell at the picketers to &#039;get to work!&#039;, complain amongst themselves that these ungrateful workers are trying to put a frum owner out of business, and do whatever they can to increase patronage at the restaurant just to make a point.


FWIW, certain aspects of a worker&#039;s rights might not be a violation of halacha . . . But neither is union organizing.  Orthodox Jewry has got to break its knee-jerk affiliation with &quot;management&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[DF -- Taking your claim of familiarity with OSHA standards at face value (though notably, you refrain from using your name in your post), it&#039;s striking (and for someone in labor practice, shocking) that you are completely unfamiliar with what occurred in the Bangladesh tragedy.  The collapse of the Bangladeshi factory complex was only the latest, deadliest chapter in the story of miserable labor conditions in the international garment industry that far exceed anything found in America.  As someone purportedly familiar with workplace standards, you could have at least surmised that the problem in Bangladesh occurred not only because of defects in construction and construction regulations, but various forms of working conditions.   And regarding your claim that I &#039;arragate&#039; (sic) in judging ethics, my standard in decrying various forms of activities that are degrading to women is the Torah.  Upon what is your system of ethics based?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why was the textile mill in Bangladesh &quot;tragically dangerous&quot; - because it collapsed?  We dont judge things retroactively to be unsafe just because an accident occured. (Nor, lest you say it, do we second guess and point to alleged defects in the cement, in the infrastructure, etc.) I practice in OSHA as part of my labor practice.

We dont judge things retroactively to be unsafe just because an accident occured.

2) No, it does NOT mean that other phones aren&#039;t recommended.  Putting a hechsher stamp on one item, does not imply any status whatsoever toward an item that doesn&#039;t happen to have the same stamp.

		<description><![CDATA[Re: your response



1) We&#039;ll have to agree to disagree.  According to Rav Moshe Feinstein, white veal grown via cruelty to animals could not be given a kosher certification.  When I lived in Israel, a hotel with a 100% kosher kitchen wanted to introduce belly-dancing as an evening dining activity.  The Rabbanut threatened to withdraw their teuda (certification) if the hotel went through with their plans. 



2) Your statement that there are two categories of food (kosher and non-kosher) doesn&#039;t take into account the existence of hundreds (if not thousands) of hechsheirim in Israel, the U.S. and elsewhere  -- many of which are neither universally accepted nor rejected.  No responsible rabbi would pronounce another hechsher as &#039;non-kosher&#039;.  He would simply say - if for no reason other than legal liability -- not recommended.  Certainly some foods are clearly and blatantly non-kosher (pork, shellfish, etc.).  But your suggestion of &#039;only two categories&#039; is misleading and overly simplistic.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to take issue with several items in this post

1)The conditions of raising calves to ensure their meat be white (for marketing purposes) can be rather extreme, involving cruel treatment of animals.  Would the author suggest that regardless, this white veal be deemed kosher?  If an eating establishment with 100% kosher food sponsors activities in the dining area contrary to both the spirit and letter of Jewish law and sensibilities (i.e. &#039;contests&#039; or shows degrading to women, being open on Shabbat), should a supervisory agency nevertheless provide that establishment with a hechsher?  If a certain food product would be produced in the equivalent of a tragically dangerous Bangladesh textile mill, should it be given a hechsher because the ingredients are kosher?  My answer to all of the above is a definitive &#039;NO&#039;.   &quot;Kosher Food&#039; means &#039;fitting to eat&#039; -- as the laws of Yoreh Deah, Choshen Mishpat, and all other relevant areas of the Torah, collectively, deem fit. 

2) The author wrote: &quot;Using the word kosher for phones and Internet implies that the non-kosher versions are not allowed to be used.&quot;   This is not accurate.  It means that other phones aren&#039;t recommended, not that a definitive pronouncement of &#039;non-kosher&#039; applies. 

3)  The author wrote: &quot;Yes, the word is a general term but it has evolved into a word that describes whether food can be eaten by orthodox Jews who keep kosher.&quot;  This statement is not only inaccurate, but divisive.  Many &#039;types&#039; of Jews eat kosher, including &#039;orthodox&#039;.   Some conservative Jews extend themselves greatly to keep kosher either fully or partially.  Many other Jews, both affiliated and non-affiliated (as well as some Jewish institutions) keep some degree of kashrut.  Labels are for clothing.  A Jew is a Jew.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here in Israel there are a plethora of Hechsherim, and they should not be seen as dictating people&#039;s morality, they are simply different institutions supervising according to their chosen level. When they put their stamp on it, it is just informing those who wish to rely on them that the food meets those standards. The moral choice is in the hands of the consumer as to which hechsher to rely on. For those who want a phone that cannot be used for internet etc., it is helpful to have an institution who check the product according to certain guidelines and then certifies that it meets those criteria chosen by the consumer and therefore by the hechsher.
If a rabbi says it is moral/immoral to do/eat/use such and such a product/hechsher, that is a &quot;moral legislation&quot; and those who choose to follow that rav&#039;s ruling should be enabled to do so by the appropriate supervision. The activity of hechsherim is there to enable people to eat not to bar them from doing so, and so it can be with phones where &quot;moral&quot; issues arise.]]></description>

If a rabbi says it is moral/immoral to do/eat/use such and such a product/hechsher, that is a &#8220;moral legislation&#8221; and those who choose to follow that rav&#8217;s ruling should be enabled to do so by the appropriate supervision. The activity of hechsherim is there to enable people to eat not to bar them from doing so, and so it can be with phones where &#8220;moral&#8221; issues arise.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The post is correct, except I wouldnt even say &quot;If someone wants to expand hechsherim, it should be for ethics first.&quot; No. The first instinct is correct. It should be for NOTHING, other than the food itself. Once one deems himself an arbiter of &quot;ethics&quot;, there is no end to the matter. People give themselves &quot;Green&quot; certification, not realizing it uses a lot more energy to be enery-efficient than it does to use simple fossil fuels. People tout their &quot;minority-friendly&quot; practices, even as they discrimiante against white men. People talk about their generous pay, while obtaining raw good overseas that contribute to job losses at home. Its hopeless, and hoplessly naive, to play this stupid game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Star-K is a trademarked stamp.  


If it appears on a product - any product - it lets me know that Rabbi Moshe Heinemann approves of the consumption / use of the product.


It&#039;s my choice if I want to follow Rabbi Heinemann&#039;s certification for food, but not for cell phones or household appliances.


You&#039;re technically right, the word &quot;kosher&quot; is out of place.  Unfortunately, since the literal meaning of kosher is &quot;proper, correct, prepared, connected&quot; - objecting to the use of the word to describe a Kharedi cell phone comes off as pedantic.




&lt;i&gt;Using the word kosher for phones and Internet implies that the non-kosher versions are not allowed to be used. &lt;/i&gt;


Does using the word kosher for food imply that non Star-K products are not allowed to be used?


The Star-K doesn&#039;t view every food product that isn&#039;t supervised by them as not kosher.


Why must we assume that they view every non Star-K cell phone that way?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think an ethical seal (they took out the word hechsher) is a great idea. But not implemented by the kashrus agency itself.


Me&#039;ushar is a much better word. Even better would be to simply say non-Internet phone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think this comes from the &quot;wing&quot; of the Star-K that certifies appliances.  And to be fair, I find that particular endeavor to be extremely worthwhile.  The Star-K&#039;s database of which appliances had approved &quot;Shabbos&quot; modes or &quot;Yom Tov&quot; modes was very helpful.


Is &quot;Kosher&quot; the best way to categorize it? Probably not.  But the service is extremely helpful, and since it comes from a &quot;Kashrus organization&quot; the particular word choice is not that troubling.


I don&#039;t disagree with you regarding food v. ethics.  However, I think distinctions need to be made between egregious violations of ethics and human rights and legislating stringencies unrelated to food. A mashgiach should have no say on teh legnth of the servers&#039; skirts. However, as a Jew with halachic credibility, a mashgiach cannot turn a blind eye to mistreatment of workers and ethical violations. And if threatening to remove the hechsher is the only way to force change, then that is the weapon in the mashgiach&#039;s arsenal.


I guess the problem is that I *am* on a slippery slope....but I&#039;m ok with that.


TL/DR: kosher phone is dumb.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree. That&#039;s why I was always against the &quot;ethical kashrus hechsher&quot;. At least here, in Israel, kosher phones are not certified by a kashrus authority but by a seperate va&#039;ad haRabbonim for communications issues. BTW, they don&#039;t officially call them kosher phones (although that&#039;s what they are universally referred to as), they call them &quot;me&#039;ushar&quot;, i.e. &quot;authorized&quot;. For once things are more reasonable here than in the US.]]></description>
