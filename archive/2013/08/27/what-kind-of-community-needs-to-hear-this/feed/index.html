Sometimes he would point out what spot to take as I was still driving. Other times he would wait for me to park and then berate me for choosing the &quot;wrong&quot; space. Even after 10 years with him, I never did figure out exactly what criteria he used to determine which space was the one I was supposed to take.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Unfortunately, some men believe they have every right to yell at their wives any time they&#039;re upset about anything (whether or not the cause of his upset has anything to do with her), and they don&#039;t see that as abuse.

Hey hey hey, we suffer our fair share from you women too :)

&#062;and even what parking space she uses at the mall



Odd. Is there some personal story behind that?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure, every &quot;normal&quot; person would agree to all four, but we certainly don&#039;t all agree on what the four mean. For instance, take the first one. My first husband was emotionally abusive. No question about it - even the marriage counselor he picked for us agreed. However, he would never - before, during, or after the divorce - agree that he was being abusive. Unfortunately, some men believe they have every right to yell at their wives any time they&#039;re upset about anything (whether or not the cause of his upset has anything to do with her), and they don&#039;t see that as abuse. Some men believe they have a right to control what their wives wear, eat, and even what parking space she uses at the mall, and they don&#039;t see that as abuse. Similarly, what one person sees as a &quot;normal conjugal relationship&quot; may be very different than how another person defines it. So, even though it looks like we&#039;re all agreeing to the same thing when we say we agree to those four things on the list, if you look closely at our individual definitions of each thing, we&#039;re really not.]]></description>

To somone in the ADL, everyone&#039;s an anti-semite. And to Rabbi Mendel Epstein, all Jewish men are evil. Puhleese, get this guy out of here.

		<description><![CDATA[Whoa! This guy is peddling a &quot;bill of rights&quot; for women based on the Kesubah. If that is the case, there is also a &quot;bill of rights&quot; for men, based on the Gemara. The only reason it wasnt formalized in a Kesubah is because it was taken for granted. Some of the rights in the Gemara include the fact that everything she owns, he owns. It also incldues the rights to have her wash his face, arms, and legs. It includes a heck of a lot more, too. Is he willing to promote that bill of rights, too?

No it doesn’t. That’s a meaningless statistic derived by taking the number of marriages in a given year and subtracting the number of divorces in the same year. 

&#062; and sex before marriage has become the standard.

No, it was always the standard. We’re doing better than we were a hundred years ago, when it was typical for young men to lose their virginity to a prostitute. Now it’s often with someone he has a real relationship with, even if they’re not married.

The world is becoming more moral, not less.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I agree to some extant with your points, I don’t have a problem with reminding people what should be common sense.  That being said, most of the problems addressed on the blogs (I mean serious thoughtful bloggers) are all inter-related, IMHO, and come full circle unfortunately.  Here is what I mean, and how I see it.

Let’s take two people who have been raised in a typical Chariedi-American home.  They have likely grown up seeing the types of attitudes that are close minded, and do not explore other hashkafos.  There is also a negative outlook in most Chariedi homes and Yeshivos towards secular education and interaction with the outside world (I love when I hear kids say “Those Evil Goyims”).  Now, let’s tell the guys and girls they have to date and marry young.  We start by having “Shidduch Resumes” to create an artificial blackmail system of paying off people to create anxiety and lie about us and dictate who can marry who based on money or having similar emotional dysfunctions.  Here comes the wedding we can’t afford (can you sat G’Mach?).  Many younger couples who get married either are scraping by and/or being supported by others.  This does not teach responsibility, and creates tremendous amounts of stress, both emotionally and financially.  Mazal Tov!  There is already kid #1 on the way (those Chosson &#038; Kallah classes really paid off!).  But guess what?  No money, poor social skills, and unrealistic expectations are what a lot of kids are being born into.  This creates more financial and emotional stress.   Now we (the young couple) are upset at Mommy &#038; Tatty for not supporting us any more (they are trying to re-finance the house again to pay back G’mach loans), angry at the wife for not supporting us (emotionally and financially), and are not getting the amount of attention from our spouse due to work and kids ( both from wife to husband and husband to wife).  Do we wonder why our young couples are seeking relationships outside of their marriages?  (Wow, guess what? that “Hot Chani” gave me some attention even after I ate Cholent! Dude!)

They aren’t fulfilled because they can’t be.  It’s not what they were expecting.  We have set our community up for failure.  Now the baby sitting and tuition kick in.  But since we don’t have professional jobs, we can’t afford to pay tuition (we used the last of our savings so Tatty could go to Uman with his “buddies” in the Ukraine, a place not only where they have killed Jews and hate us, but also a place where the family gets separated for the High Holy Days-sorry honey, you have to fast and take care of the kids, but this was important).  Greetings Tuition crisis, we never saw you coming!  Now the kids don’t see a healthy relationship.  There is stress at home and in school.  The kids are in a system that ignores problems (for we have been in a cave, in Lakewood, with our eyes closed, and our fingers in our ears going “La la la la this isn’t happening).   Now the kids are 14-15 years old and even if the marriage has survived the kids are looking at the world through the internet (quickly, ban it or it may lead to mixed blogging!) and learning that there are other ways of looking at the world, and some people are-gasp-happy!  They can even ask questions to others and talk!  At home, they see stress, anxiety, and unhappiness in what could have been, and what should have been a wonderful culture.  Then, when the kids go OTD (yet another crisis) we act shocked!  Quick, send that kid to Israel! (The BIBLICAL one, everyone knows the State is Evil, se we’ll just ignore it –La-la-la fingers back in our ears) Great.  He/she’s been brainwashed.  Let’s start the cycle again and see what happens.;  Wash, rinse, repeat.  Oh my, are we doomed.  

BTW, I love the blog, and the new look!.  Chag Kosher Vsamayach!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; Fink, while I agree that shouldn&#039;t have a knee jerk reaction to anything secular. There is definitely wisdom outside of torah. However, to say we need to start learning about marriage from secular books, in my opinion is going to far (with the exception are Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus - a great read!). The problems we are facing in the community is due to a lack of sincere Torah values, not a rejection from the outside. Torah Judaism is more than just learning Gemara  and keeping a glatt kosher home. It Yes, their are gentiles with happy marriages, but think the solution is for yeshivas to put more energy in teaching about shalom bayit. The US has a 50% divorce rate and sex before marriage has become the standard. So I would hardly consider most of secular society as role models in this realm.]]></description>
