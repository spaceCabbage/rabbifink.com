		<description><![CDATA[i dont get it- how do you explain gezeira shava, which chazal used to explain certain halacha? how do you explain all the commentary, in general, by chazal made on every letter? if man edited the torah, then all of that is just a bunch of mistaken nonsense, no? if the torah were written by hashem- then sure, we can make sense of gezeira shava, and why there&#039;s an aleph here and an ayin there, and why a certain word is doubled etc.  if man edited the torah, then all of that- all of it- is one big &quot;oops&quot;, no?  i would be grateful if you could answer each question i pose. i am not interested in the fact that the torah, as you see it, is inspired from a divine being and halacha is a great way to live. that is not in dispute. i am interested only in answers to the questions i posed. thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; The only reason any Jew sees noakh as a real person (and Utnapishtim perhaps as a corruption of noakh) is because we trust khaza&quot;l and our ancestors.

Perhaps, but I think it’s more likely that it’s because we’re brought up with the story of Noach, and so take it as part of our default world, while we only encounter Utnapishtim as adults, if at all.

&#062; Once you stop doing that, why are you Jewish at all?

That’s an odd question. You might ask, why be religious, but Jewish? You’re Jewish because you are.

&#062; Our ancestors were either frauds or gullible fools.

Neither. Our ancestors were the inadvertent creators of a rich tradition of myths that eventually became the Torah. No one ever deliberately created the whole thing from scratch (a fraud) or accepted it from out of the blue (gullible fools). The stories developed slowly, over centuries or millennia, most probably from a seed of reality, much like the legend of King Arthur grew around a Roman officer in ancient Britain.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is just silly talk. Where have I EVER said anything like these things? Community activiism. Everything from Chazal is a lie? You have not read anything by me, have you? 
As for worshipping the Torah, the great Rav Shmuel who passed away on Rosh Hashanah would have disagreed with your assessment. He noted many ways in which Jews throughout the centuries and today have fallen into the trap of actually worshipping the Torah. (The implications of talking about the Torah as divine is to fail to make a distinction between God and the Torah, and much of the fear of biblical criticism grows out of failure to distinguish between the two.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When we say that the tora is divine it obviously does not mean it&#039;s G-d.  Otherwise we&#039;d say that the tora is G-d (of course the zohar does say that, but that&#039;s a different story).  It means it comes from G-d.  Not sure why you&#039;re getting caught up on those semantics.  No Jews I know worshiping the text or the scroll of the sefer tora.


What&#039;s interesting is that the very idea that G-d commanded us to keep the mitsvot seems a much better preserver of our religion than community activism.  Yes, we have attrition.  But at least we have something from which to have attrition as opposed to having nothing but nice communities that have no binding power.  Where in history have you seen that work?  But these arguments about attrition and assimilation are strawmen.  Unless we&#039;re all taking part in some horrible fraud (which others bring up here can sometimes cause great emotional and even physical injury to its adherents and to their friends and family), We observe the tora because it&#039;s true and because G-d wants us to (and we have gratitude or fear or whatever).  Not because it&#039;s a nice religion.  That&#039;s verifiably untrue.  It&#039;s often not a nice religion.  And this really has nothing to do with your area of study.  Your area is to try to show that everything we were taught by our ancestors and khaza&quot;l is a lie.  Now that may be true, But then how foolish am I to listen to them as either hucksters or fools?  And where does G-d, the m&#039;tsave come from?  Did Sinai happen?  Did G-d lie about that?  I really am interested in hearing what people who believe in  biblical criticism believe in terms of Judaism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You don&#039;t capitalize gods as far as I know.  The difference between Christianity/Islam and everything else derivative of Judaism (e.g. Bahai) and the pagan or pantheist religions is that they don&#039;t believe in a single Creator who cared about us and communicated with us (some American Indian religions may actually have such a concept),  khaza&quot;l were certainly aware of many pagan religions if not the American ones, and we understand them to be natural ways for humans to deal with a big scary world.  In fact, our mission is to teach the world about G-d (and Christianity and Islam have certainly helped make fertile soil).

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll add this discussion for &quot;required reading&quot; to know what academics are saying now. 


http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/bad368008.shtml



The reason why the divinity of the tora matters is to the extent that khaza&quot;l lied to us.  And if they lied to us, why would we trust them with anything?  Were they frauds?  Or were they gullible?  Either way, they were then the backward patriarchal sexist racist barbarics that the modern Left makes them out to be.  kh&quot;v.


Halivni comes the closest to a heretical belief that could sit well with me.  And he tries to minimize the fraud/ignorance of khaza&quot;l by bringing Talmudic sources to support that Ezra did something and that the text of the tora had become corrupted.  Instead, he puts his faith kin the Talmud and the tora sheb&#039;al pe preserving Judaism more than the corrupted written text.  But his khaza&quot;l still minimize what Ezra did out of fraud or ignorance (I believe Halivni chooses ignorance) and the entire concept of the 13 midot shehatora nidreshet bahen is phooey.  So that&#039;s the basic problem with believing in these hypotheses and being Orthodox.  We are descendants of the Pharisees, which ironically means that they are both more important than the written tora (hence Halivni) and that the written tora is 99% what hashem actually told moshe to write down (hence Halivni is a bit of a heretic).


Wright is absolutely a heretic from traditional (and certainly &quot;Orthodox&quot; Judaism) by any normal usage of the word.  That&#039;s not a judgment, but a fact.  I&#039;d need to learn more to figure out if there&#039;s an issue with him being included in a minyan etc., but otherwise I think it&#039;s nice he&#039;s orthoprax.  I wish he wasn&#039;t misled in his beliefs and hopefully he&#039;ll come to t&#039;shuva later in life.  Hell, hopefully I&#039;ll come to t&#039;shuva.  I&#039;m not heretical, but I&#039;ve got my own problems getting up for davening on time.


But back to your question, R&#039; Fink.  So this is very different than a makhloket over whether a mitsva is d&#039;rabanan or d&#039;oraita.  It&#039;s whether khaza&quot;l were just unfit to transmit a religion that may or may not have ever been true in the first place.  Thoughts?]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ll add this discussion for &#8220;required reading&#8221; to know what academics are saying now. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/bad368008.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/bad368008.shtml</a></p>
<p>The reason why the divinity of the tora matters is to the extent that khaza&#8221;l lied to us.  And if they lied to us, why would we trust them with anything?  Were they frauds?  Or were they gullible?  Either way, they were then the backward patriarchal sexist racist barbarics that the modern Left makes them out to be.  kh&#8221;v.</p>
<p>Halivni comes the closest to a heretical belief that could sit well with me.  And he tries to minimize the fraud/ignorance of khaza&#8221;l by bringing Talmudic sources to support that Ezra did something and that the text of the tora had become corrupted.  Instead, he puts his faith kin the Talmud and the tora sheb&#8217;al pe preserving Judaism more than the corrupted written text.  But his khaza&#8221;l still minimize what Ezra did out of fraud or ignorance (I believe Halivni chooses ignorance) and the entire concept of the 13 midot shehatora nidreshet bahen is phooey.

		<description><![CDATA[I do think traditional Torah observance (i.e. strict adherence to halacha) is contingent on solid belief in TMS.   Even though many of the rituals observed on a day to day basis may be based on rabbinic law and custom, the obligation to follow rabbinic law is always linked back to Torah law.  (They never get tired of reminding you of that in yeshiva either so you&#039;ll buy into modern day &quot;Daas Toyrah&quot;)  The authority of the Great Assembly or anyone before or after to enact binding rulings is drawn from the belief that they are divinely ordained for that purpose - not unlike Pharaohs and monarchs in antiquity.   When you start trimming away the divine nature, and attribute larger portions to human authorship. you will start to lose commitment in subsequent generations. 



Take Shmirat Shabbat: Maybe it&#039;s not that hard to instill an appreciation for the beauty of Shabbat and it&#039;s intrinsic value to children.   However, I think without belief that the system, has some sort of divine seal, a lot of the details of halacha will be disregarded.   e.g.#1  Who cares if the water for my tea is a &lt;i&gt;kli sheine&lt;/i&gt; or a &lt;i&gt;kli shlishi&lt;/i&gt;?   Either making tea is cooking the tea leaves or it&#039;s not?  Why does God care if I pour the water into another vessel before dropping in the tea bag?   



There can be a meaningful Shabbat without all the minutia.  The present generation of TMS-tweakers will keep it because it&#039;s harmless (they&#039;re only trying to change that which is an affront to their present day morality) and they&#039;re accustomed to it.  However, when the next generation grows up with the &quot;knowledge&quot; that they&#039;re living in a man-made system that&#039;s pliable, why wouldn&#039;t they do away with lots of the technicalities that don&#039;t necessarily make sense to us today?



I think the kind of commitment that normative halachic observance calls for (with it&#039;s extraordinary attention to minutia) requires an amount for Yirat Shamayim that that rests in the trust that the Torah and the oral law are in some way all &quot;God&#039;s law.&quot;  Without that you have a lot of recommendations for a meaningful and fulfilled life, but not an enduring system.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ruvie- 

since you cannot show divine from non divine words - its not a subject of inquiry

I agree with that

&quot;go read some kugel&quot;

I&#039;ve only read a drop of his stuff:
http://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/conversation-with-james-kugel-about-revelation/
&quot;Torah min ha-Shamayim is what counts. As Hazal said, anyone who says the whole Torah comes from G-d except for this one pasuk, which Moshe wrote on his own—such a person is a blasphemer who dishonors the Torah.&quot;

&quot;its fairly simple. the evidence and data take you wherever it may go with no blinders of religion interfering - thats the key: open inquiry&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s utterly absurd and even more ignorant.  If you WERE interested in the truth, you wouldn&#039;t just choose whichever theory makes you feel good; you would choose the one that is most plausible.  In this case, where there is plenty of evidence the Bible is man-made, and there is zero evidence that any of it is not, you can either choose to be honest with yourself or not.

If you WERE interested in the truth, you wouldn&#8217;t just choose whichever theory makes you feel good; you would choose the one that is most plausible.  In this case, where there is plenty of evidence the Bible is man-made, and there is zero evidence that any of it is not, you can either choose to be honest with yourself or not.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;If it weren’t the Bible and I weren’t orthodox, this would be a great theory to explain anomalies in the text. But it is the Bible and I am orthodox so it hardly sits well with me when the Bible is explained away as myth.&quot;

Wow.  At least you&#039;re honest about your academic dishonesty.  

How about we just try to figure out what is TRUE, and then accept what is TRUE, regardless of our previous biases?  How about we determine whether the Bible was more likely written by humans - like every other literary work in history - given all its contradictions, anachronisms, linguistic variations, scribal errors, scientific errors, historical errors, borrowings from earlier Near Eastern texts, etc, or that it&#039;s morelikely that it was the one literary work ever made that wasn&#039;t completely man-made, and then just accept the truth, wherever it&#039;s what we want to hear or not?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the Shomer Torah u’Mitzvos meme, Joel Rich (who self-identifies as RWMO) made a perceptive comment on Hirhurim some time back:  “The torah has basic rules about inheritance … how does one justify arranging their will to bypass the halachic default rules?”

The point is not to argue the specific example, rather to observe that even those who believe in literal TMS, don’t follow the law that God dictated.  We follow Rabbinic Judaism, which is “Divinely Inspired” rather than “the Word of God”.  Another obstacle on the slippery slope argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the relevant comment there is on this thread also: &quot;1) The part of my piece about the divine origins is a theological point. It has nothing whatsoever to do with you&#039;re talking about. You need to read the rest of the comments. I affirm that Torah is from a divine source (even though I see the revelation process much differently than a simplistic speaking from the cloud). But it&#039;s not divine itself. That is Orthodox theology, my friend: Divinity must only be ascribed to God, not to anything else. You can say the fact that the words are God&#039;s words makes them on par with God. But that would be like saying that if I write something, an essay let&#039;s say, that it&#039;s me rather than originated with me. Zev and I do not differ on this point.&quot;


I have no problem with the saying it&#039;s not divine itself -- the bible not being on par with god -- but what does the divine source mean? My problem is not what he negates; it&#039;s in what he is positively ascribing. Or is vagueness itself a virtue?]]></description>
