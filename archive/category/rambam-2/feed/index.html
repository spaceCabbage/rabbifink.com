<p>We began with a review of the idea discussed in last week&#8217;s class and is summarized in this blog post: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/06/12/maimonides-and-kollel/">Maimonides and Kollel</a>. Then we moved to a very important discussion about what the Rambam called Torah She&#8217;Baal Peh and what the Rambam called Gemara. We also spent time dealing with the Rambam&#8217;s opinion on women&#8217;s obligation to study Torah and their various social ramifications including some provocative conversation about the Women at the Wall.</p>
<p>The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.</p>

		<itunes:summary>The Rambam class continued today.

We finished chapter 5 today. Here the Rambam instructs us to have a job, then to buy a home, then to marry. This is a great idea and the Rambam proves it from the Chumash. A very fascinating section of the Mishnah Torah.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.

<p>Today we began Chapter 4 in Hilchos Deyos. We tried to get through it quickly. The chapter is a memorandum on medieval medicine. The Rambam advises his readers to follow contemporary medicine to live a healthy life. While the manner by which 11th century physicians advised their patients to live is no longer applicable, we should seek out the same kind of contemporary information to live a healthy life.</p>

		<itunes:summary>The Rambam class continued today.

Today we began Chapter 4 in Hilchos Deyos. We tried to get through it quickly. The chapter is a memorandum on medieval medicine. The Rambam advises his readers to follow contemporary medicine to live a healthy life. While the manner by which 11th century physicians advised their patients to live is no longer applicable, we should seek out the same kind of contemporary information to live a healthy life.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.

Today we continued further into Chapter 5. The Rambam talks about some more ethical quandaries involving death and adultery. The issues raised are serious and deserve even more time and contemplation than we have given them. Consider the class &quot;food for thought&quot;.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.
