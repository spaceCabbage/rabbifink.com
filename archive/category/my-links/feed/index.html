				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Israel, a haredi woman named Ruth Colian is asking that the Israeli government stop funding haredi political parties because they discriminate against women. The haredi parties will not place a woman on their ballots, yet they are receiving money from the government. Colian argues that the government is sponsoring gender discrimination by supporting the patriarchal system of haredi Judaism in politics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good argument and I hope she wins. But that&#8217;s not the issue here.<span id="more-7733"></span></p>
<p>The real issue is that Colian is running as a haredi woman for political office. She won&#8217;t run on a secular list because she says she is haredi. She wants to break the glass ceiling in the haredi community. I wish her luck because it won&#8217;t be easy. In the past, people who tried to change haredi norms were either pushed out or left on their own accord. It&#8217;s an uncomfortable place to be a revolutionary but maybe Colian will be the one.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7735" alt="feminism2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/feminism2-510x600.jpg" /></p>
<p>If she is successful, it will mean yet another avenue that haredi women can achieve the same level of acclaim and success as men. Leaving the rabbinate as one of the few places haredi women cannot. That might prove to be a difficult position to maintain.</p>
<p>Corian is a true haredi feminist. She is haredi and she is vying for equal opportunities for women. This is the basic premise of feminism. It comes in many flavors and textures, but at the heart of all of these feminist movements is a sense that men and women should have equal opportunities and that men should not dictate the role that women must play in society. One can see how feminism and haredi life seem incompatible. While it&#8217;s true that many, if not most, haredi women choose to play the dignified and refined role of mother, wife, and homemaker on the sidelines of religious and communal life, there are many women who would prefer to have a choice to play a more public role in religious and communal life. That is what the haredi feminists want.</p>
<p>When juxtaposed with a trailer for an upcoming documentary on the hasidic community of Brooklyn called Uniforms: The Hasidic #Community, Corian&#8217;s struggle seems even more poignant. The documentary was produced by a self proclaimed non-traditional Jewish woman. She offers a peek into the softer, more spiritual side of Hasidic Judaism. It&#8217;s a noble attempt to show good people living good lives. The public has a negative perception of Hasidic Judaism and this documentary could go a long way to bridging that divide.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the extremely problematic conflation of different hasidic groups in the movie, illustrated by the visuals of chasidim in shtreimels and double head coverings for the women, while hip Chabad people talk about their more liberal way of life, there was a line in the trailer that requires attention.</p>
<p>A woman, who almost certainly is Chabad as betrayed by her perfectly unaccented English, proclaims: <em>&#8220;Jewish [sic] women, we&#8217;re kind of the biggest feminist women out there. Judaism creates space for women to tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I think that if a woman wants to &#8220;tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children&#8221; she should have that opportunity. I am all for traditional values for women that want those values in their lives. It&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s one of the secrets to Orthodox Judaism. In fact, I think it&#8217;s a problem that so many husbands and fathers are studying all day while their wives are leaving the home to support their husbands and babies are being dropped off at day care. I believe the traditional home is a great ideal and bearing children is a wonderful and powerful role to play in this world.</p>
<p>However, it is decidedly not feminist. It can be feminist to choose that life. But if everyone is doing it, or is expected to do it, it does not fit any accepted meaning of the word. You can&#8217;t unilaterally change the entire meaning of the word feminist and apply it to haredi Judaism. It doesn&#8217;t pass the laugh test, forget the smell test.</p>
<p>And why is feminism an ideal for this haredi woman? Why is she trying to pretend that a world where women are not given every opportunity that men are given and they are expected to produce large families is feminist. It&#8217;s not feminist at all. Proudly so! Recently, I heard a prominent rabbi say that Jewish feminists were comparable to reform and conservative Judaism! Orthodox Judaism is not feminist. You need to be okay with that to be orthodox.</p>
<p>In Israel, Ruth Corian is dying for the opportunity to lead her community. She is a feminist. In Brooklyn the party line is apparently that being a mom is the most feminist thing one can do.</p>
<p>Again, I am not degrading moms. God forbid! I think it&#8217;s a great choice if one can and one wants to make it. But it&#8217;s not feminist if that is what is expected. But even more perplexing is why are you trying to call it feminist?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is an isolated incident. I&#8217;ve seen this more and more often. People are selling Orthodox Judaism as feminist. I&#8217;m a pretty liberal Orthodox Jew and I don&#8217;t see how anyone could interpret my religion as feminist.</p>
<p>Personally, it bothers me. I grapple with it. I struggle with the current inequality and I empathize with those orthodox Jewish women who want to play a more prominent public role. I wish Orthodox Judaism had more feminist opportunities. I do my best to accommodate feminism within tradition. But I don&#8217;t redefine the term to conform to my orthodox worldview. Words have meaning and that meaning must be respected.</p>
<p>It seems impossible, if not extremely unlikely, that orthodox Judaism will ever have equal opportunities for men and women. Maybe that&#8217;s okay. Not every religion or creed has to conform with every modern sensibility. But let&#8217;s at least be honest about it. And if we can, try to break as many glass ceilings that we can shatter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are quite a few approaches that religious people take in their attitude toward atheists and atheism. Three different ideas have been pitched or implemented in various outlets over the last couple of weeks. Seeing as so many of my fellow Jews are atheists, closeted or otherwise, I think it&#8217;s a question that contemporary Judaism must address.<span id="more-7721"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7722" alt="photo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo-600x449.jpg" /></p>
<p>A billboard in New York&#8217;s Times Square proclaims: <em>&#8220;To all of our atheist friends: Thank God you’re wrong.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cute line. It&#8217;s not very substantive and I see no chance of winning any atheists over with this kind of advertisement. It&#8217;s cool that God is getting a shout-out in Times Square. It&#8217;s definitely a lone voice among a very vocal majority of very unGodly advertisements and signage in that spot. But that&#8217;s the only value I can see in it.</p>
<p>The New York Times contrasted this billboard with a recent statement by the Pope: <em>“Given – and this is the fundamental thing – that God’s mercy has no limits, if He is approached with a sincere and repentant heart the question for those who do not believe in God is to abide by their own conscience. There is sin, also for those who have no faith, in going against one’s conscience. Listening to it and abiding by it means making up one’s mind about what is good and evil.”</em></p>
<p>In other words, I think the Pope is saying that actions are far more important than faith. This is particularly ironic coming from Catholicism which has traditionally placed such a great emphasis on belief. In fact, part of the Orthodox Jewish meme on Christianity is that they are all about faith while we are about action. (I&#8217;m not saying this is true. I am saying that this is taught.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a much more inclusive message than the billboard&#8217;s message. I think the Pope&#8217;s message will have a greater influence on positive social behavior than a snarky anti-atheist sign. It also increases the chances that a non-believer would care to be involved in religion. The Pope wins this one.</p>
<p>Rabbi Avi Shafran also proposed some billboards to promote Orthodox Judaism. His ideas: <em>What if, instead of special offers and glitzy offerings, we simply proclaimed loud and clear – in billboards and web ads and social media – that being a Jew, like it or not, precious fellow Jew, means being Divinely charged, that it means shouldering, whether it is always comfortable or not, responsibility ? And that ignoring that mandate is a reckless wasting of an opportunity to live a meaningful life by doing G-d’s will? That each of us has a stark and urgent choice: either to regard our lives as the brief opportunities to access eternity they are, or to waste one’s days in the pursuit of stuff and fun and “rights”?</em></p>
<p>I think this sounds more like the Times Square billboards than the Pope. While advertising our message is a great idea, I fear that advertising a hard line message is not going to win too many people over. I think that the approach largely depends on one&#8217;s goal. For some, the goal is that people join your movement. That&#8217;s a good goal if your movement is a good one. It also depends on whether people are amenable to your movements rules and regulations.</p>
<p>But Orthodox Judaism is not for everyone. It can be. But right now it is not. So perhaps we would be better off with a goal echoed by the Pope. We should be promoting positive, universal values that will help improve the world. Help people who might need a boost find something in their Judaism or other religious heritage that can help them in their lives.</p>
<p>There is so much that religion can offer people, even if they are not believers. Giving them those opportunities trumps snarky billboards and heavy handed pressure, in my opinion. Yes, we need to get the message out there. The question is what is that message.</p>
<p>I think the message is that religion and in particular Judaism can be beneficial to people no matter what they believe.</p>

<p>Turns out, I made a big mistake and misremembered what the Torah Temimah said. It&#8217;s inexcusable and I regret not double checking what he actually says before I posted. <em>Chatasi.</em> So I wrote a second post correcting my error.</p>

<p>The Torah Temimah lists <em>Damesek</em> as one of many examples where the Torah uses a foreign language in the Torah. He says that the word is used as &#8220;domestic help&#8221; in &#8220;old languages&#8221; and is still used in French in this way.</p>
<p>In the comments, people wonder if this is a big deal. Maybe it&#8217;s not. It definitely shouldn&#8217;t be a big deal but I think it is a big deal. Here is why.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7714" alt="255337-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/255337-1-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p>There are some questions about the Bible that have traditional answers. But some of those traditional answers appear to be insufficient to Orthodox Jews in 5774. Sometimes the questions are better than the answers. One kind of answer that has been presented and rejected by traditionalists is that the Torah speaks in the language of man and may include anachronisms that made sense to the original intended audience in a way that our modern ears can&#8217;t relate.</p>
<p>The reason this approach is rejected is because it breaks some of the self imposed traditional frum rules of learning Torah. It&#8217;s considered too liberal or too reform-like to allow for non-eternal meanings to the Torah.</p>
<p>Two of the arguments used to bolster this claim are that the Torah was a closed book at Sinai and that the Torah cannot be influenced by factors external to the text itself. The commonly held position on the closing of the Bible is that everything was taught at Sinai. Opinions that allow for the final verses (and more) to have been added by later prophets from unimpeachable sources are shunned because they burst this bubble. Similarly, allowing for outside influence into the Torah implies that the Torah is somewhat subjective. For example, the famous statement of Maimonides that sacrifices were a concession to a people with pagan leanings is considered borderline problematic. The conventional wisdom is that if the Torah included sacrifices it must have been God&#8217;s &#8220;original intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Showing that the Torah is a book with external influence bolsters the claim of Maimonides and may allow for extending it to other ideas in the Torah. This is considered dangerous and out of bounds for &#8220;Torah True&#8221; Jews.</p>
<p>Whenever we have traditionally accepted sources that allow for outside influence we are showing that the contemporary reluctance to this kind of interpretation actually runs counter to tradition. The Torah Temimah had no problem listing several places in the Bible where the Torah borrows from other languages. This is a big deal.</p>
<p>Of the two options above, let&#8217;s call them &#8220;closed book&#8221; and &#8220;not completely closed book,&#8221; which fits better with this Torah Temimah? It&#8217;s clearly the &#8220;not completely closed book&#8221; option. In other words, we are reinforcing the idea that the Torah could have outside influences. Why would the Torah use a non-Bible word it its text? It certainly could have used a native word or invented a Biblical word. Why didn&#8217;t it? Isn&#8217;t the obvious answer that the Torah was speaking to an audience familiar with these words and thus it chose to use familiar language?</p>
<p>The implication of that answer is that the Torah considers its audience. It spoke in a way that people would expect it to speak. It&#8217;s an eternal book that was written under specific circumstances. Therefore we are able to extend this theory to answer questions we have with new non-traditional answers. The answers might be new, but the approach is not new. Of course we are not at liberty to change it or ignore its commands, God forbid. But we can understand many of its tenets, rules, and stories in this context.</p>
<p>This might shed light on the Creation Story and the Flood Story. Or not. But I think it should be an option on the table for Orthodox Jews.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was long assumed that fact checkers only served to correct erroneous information as a service to the public. However they were not thought to influence the truthfulness of politicians in general. In other words, it was assumed that politicians don&#8217;t lie less often because they are scared of being caught in a lie.</p>
<p>Today, the New York times reports on a study that shows that awareness of Politifact, a well known fact checking outfit, does in fact make a difference.</p>
<p><span id="more-7689"></span></p>
<p>In the study, over 1,000 politicians were sent letters by two professors. One group was reminded that Politifact was out there watching them and that lies would damage their career if the lies were exposed. The politicians sent return postcards acknowledging receipt of the letters. The second group were given a general statement telling them that the accuracy of their statements was being measured. A third group received no letters.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7690" alt="whistleblower" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/whistleblower-600x450.jpg" /></p>
<p>Significantly fewer politicians from group one made false statements than politicians from group two. Almost three times as many legislators from the second and third group made false statements. It seems that awareness of fact checking does indeed makes a difference.</p>
<p>Similarly, in our community there is a sense that bloggers are useless and just preaching to the choir. This might be true. But if the leadership is aware that they are being &#8220;fact checked&#8221; it seems that it will have an impact on policy and behavior. If so, there is a great benefit the J-Blogs are providing.</p>
<p>Fact checking leadership means asking tough questions. It can also mean exposing lies or untruths. Sometimes it means challenging conventional wisdom. Other times it means pointing out that a commonly held belief is not universally held in our tradition. There are many ways blogs fact check orthodox Judaism. It makes a difference.</p>
<p>Of course this requires leadership to be aware of the blogs. Some are. Some are not. But whistleblowers and dissenting opinions coming from the street are making a difference. Eventually, it will be impossible to continue to ignore their voice. But even if the issues raised are not specifically addressed, we can be sure that they are making a difference simply because they exist. People act differently when they know they are being watched and when errors are going to be exposed.</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter have given even more people a strong voice. But blogs will always be an important form of discourse and communication. It is on blogs that ideas are more thoroughly discussed and analyzed. Blog are also beneficiaries of Google. Search any Jewish topic and you&#8217;ll find blogs that have written on the subject.</p>
<p>The voice of the J-Blogosphere can be confusing, annoying, angry, cynical, unpopular, and negative. But it also serves the very important purpose of fact checkers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while ago, I commented somewhere on Facebook (I think it was a Joshie Berger rant) that orthodox Jews don&#8217;t <em>really</em> believe that humans can&#8217;t live past 120 years old. Frum people know that humans can live past 120. So it&#8217;s not a challenge to orthodox Jewish faith that in recorded history, especially recently, humans have outpaced the 120 mark on several occasions.</p>
<p>I believe the popular source for the belief that 120 is the age limit for humans is a combination of this verse in Parshas Breishis <em>&#8220;And the LORD said: &#8216;My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh; therefore shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.&#8221;</em> (6:3) and the fact that Moses lived to 120 as well.<span id="more-7681"></span></p>
<p>However, Rashi quotes the midrashic interpretation that the verse as referring to the years that God waits before punishing mankind. The Ibn Ezra explicitly rejects the opinion that people cannot live past 120 years that is based on this verse as well.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the Torah Temimah does this and more. He quotes the Jerusalam Talmud in Nazir that asks how it&#8217;s possible for people to only live to 120 if Adam lived to almost 1000?! The Talmud answer that the verse is referring to decomposition. The bones of a person decompose after 120 years. (7:2)<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bones.pdf"><br />
</a><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7684" alt="A-previous-burial-was-pushed-out-of-the-way-to-make-way-for-this-womans-skeleton.-There-were-two-football-field-size-cemeteries-found-on-this-site-where-250-skeletons-were-found.-Mike-Hettwer-960x617" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/A-previous-burial-was-pushed-out-of-the-way-to-make-way-for-this-womans-skeleton.-There-were-two-football-field-size-cemeteries-found-on-this-site-where-250-skeletons-were-found.-Mike-Hettwer-960x617-600x385.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Torah Temimah notes that the Talmud is bothered by the plain fact that the verse is contradicted by people who lived longer than 120 years and even other Torah verses that describe longer lifetimes. So the Talmud answers that the verse is not to be taken literally and is instead referring to decomposition.</p>
<p>But this is of little help. The Torah Temimah correctly points out that there are sources in our tradition of bones that lasted longer than 120 post mortem like the bones of Joseph. He also cites secular experts who have found old bones of people known to have died more than 120 years prior to their discovery. By the way, decomposition takes between 10-75 years depending on soil conditions according to my research.</p>
<p>So the Torah Temimah is forced to say that the Talmud is making a general statement for which there are more exceptions that situations where the rule applies. It cannot even be talking about every bone in a person&#8217;s body because the Talmud talks about the bone in our spine that never decomposes and is the place from where we will regenerate in the times of the Messiah. Therefore, the Jerusalem Talmud must be speaking in vague terms and is not meant to be taken as a definitive, universal statement.</p>
<p>I find this Torah Temimah fascinating. Evidence from the Torah and science can disprove the idea that people drop dead if they reach 120. So we are easily able to dismiss that verse as literally true. But the solution suffers from the same flaws as the question. There are fossils that are millions of years old. And not just the bone that &#8220;doesn&#8217;t decompose.&#8221; There are many more skeletons that have completely decomposed. Even that bone from the spine that is not supposed to decompose decomposes. These are demonstrable facts.</p>
<p>So now we have two options. We can say that the Torah Temimah and his interpretation of the Talmud are correct and our eyes deceived us or we can say he erred. The interesting thing is that I think we can be certain which path the Torah Temimah would choose. He would choose the latter. That is how he arrived at his position in the first place!</p>
<p>There is nothing frummer about the first option. Especially when we are using it to &#8220;help&#8221; an authority that chose the second option time and time again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no different when we talk abuot Chazal. They also chose the second choice whenever they found out they made a mistake. It&#8217;s not frummer to choose option one to &#8220;help&#8221; Chazal when they themselves chose the second option in various places.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ami Magazine published an article by Sara Yocheved Rigler that would have many of our Geonim and Rishonim turning over in their graves. In a nutshell, the article describes strange phenomena such as fear of Nazi related imagery or fear of situations that might be similar to Holocaust experiences. The people experiencing these things are not able to explain why they have these fears.</p>
<p>According to the article, these are manifestations of reincarnated souls from the Holocaust. That is the only explanation given for these oddities (which are not very odd at all). In fact, the article goes so far as to suggest that non-Jews are also reincarnated with Jewish souls from the Holocaust and this is what draws them toward conversion. Of course this is problematic because those who believe in reincarnation and recycling of souls also believe that souls only transmigrate from Jew to Jew and non-Jews are given new souls with each birth. This is waved away by a rabbi quoted in the article who says if you wanted to be a non-Jew in a previous life you come back as a non-Jew.</p>
<p>I have three basic issues with this article.<span id="more-7676"></span></p>
<p>1. It is disingenuous because it uses anecdotes from people who do not necessarily agree with the article as support for the article&#8217;s ideas. For example, Rabbi Berel Wein is quoted at the beginning of the article. He related that the Ponevezher Rav once said to a group of young couples in Miami that their job was to repopulate the world with Jews in the aftermath of the Holocaust. That is a common Jewish sentiment from the mid-20th century. The problem is that it is being used as some sort of support for the idea that Jews born in America are reincarnations of people who perished in the Holocaust. He said nothing of the sort. He meant nothing of the sort. There is simply no reason to think he did.</p>
<p>Another similar example is using R&#8217; Lau&#8217;s recollection of the Holocaust. He famously said that experiencing the Holocaust as a child left him with three strong memories. Dogs, boots, and trains. This is somehow used as support for the idea that someone who is afraid of boots is reincarnated from someone who perished in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Neither of those stories has anything to do with reincarnation. But it gives the article &#8220;credence&#8221; to toss a few familiar names into the article to prove irrelevant, agreed upon points.</p>
<p>2. Stay away from the Holocaust. Trying to explain Holocaust deaths as <em>tikkun</em> and a way of cleansing a soul is offensive. We don&#8217;t know why people die. We don&#8217;t even know if there is always a reason that people die. To try to make death feel better because it&#8217;s part of a giant soul reincarnation cleansing plan is no better than saying they died because of their sins. It&#8217;s ugly.</p>
<p>But more importantly, it demonstrates that the real reason reincarnation is being discussed in this context is to make us feel better. We don&#8217;t understand death and destruction so we explain it with reincarnation. We don&#8217;t understand how millions could die for no reason so we explain it with reincarnation. We can&#8217;t explain a fear of showers or boots so it must be reincarnated souls from the Holocaust. There might be better answers to these questions. But the article does not explore them. Using the emotional appeal of the Holocaust to draw us into a reincarnation narrative is inappropriate.</p>
<p>3. Most importantly, reincarnation is a very controversial subject in Judaism. It&#8217;s not mentioned in Tanach. It&#8217;s not mentioned in the Talmud or Medrash. It&#8217;s rejected by most of the Geonim. It is rejected or ignored by many of the mainstream Rishonim. It serves no theological purpose other than to explain things that might be able to be explained in another way.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Gilgul-Ami.pdf"><br />
</a></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7678" alt="img-kickstartbusiness" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/img-kickstartbusiness.jpg" /></p>
<p>The article jumps right into reincarnation without a moment&#8217;s consideration of the very prominent Torah authority figures that reject reincarnation. This is at worst a lie and at best ignorance. But either way it is incomplete. Gilgul is not a necessary belief in orthodox Judaism. In fact, it might be worst to believe in it than not to believe in it. Why are we normalizing this kind of thing? Why are we discarding the valid opinions that don&#8217;t hold of gilgul? Why is it okay to just side with the Arizal on everything and forget about everyone else?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to make the complete case against gilgul here. But I will make a couple of points.</p>
<p>The Ancient Greeks believed in reincarnation. We did not. We knew their beliefs and we rejected them in the time of Chazal. It&#8217;s impossible to say that Jews did not talk about reincarnation because they just didn&#8217;t know that it could exist. It was known and it was not accepted. It began to be accepted by a select few Rishonim after being rejected by the two most prominent early Rishonim that discuss Hashkafa, Rambam and Rabbi Judah HaLevi. The one prominent Rishon who does mention gilgul is Ramban and he does so at the expense of an interpretation on the verse that is in Chazal. In other words, they had a different explanation for the verse. The interpretation of Ramban contradicts Chazal.</p>
<p>In the 15th and 16th century there was a renewed interest in this sort of thing. Dybbuks also became more popular in this period. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/21/book-review-between-worlds-dybbuks-exorcists-and-early-modern-judaism/">Between Worlds: Dybbuks, Exorcists, and Early Modern Judaism </a>) But it&#8217;s no fait accompli that gilguls and dybbuks are part of Judaism. We have no idea if it&#8217;s true and our early sources say that it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a positive development that these beliefs have gone mainstream. They are too easy to reject and cast aspersion on the more vital parts of Judaism. We don&#8217;t need this stuff in Judaism and it doesn&#8217;t improve our lives. Why are we so willing and eager to embrace it in our publications without question? This is my little protest. Don&#8217;t force these beliefs down our throats. It&#8217;s not integral to Judaism.</p>
<p><em>(Note: Reincarnation at the times of Messiah has nothing to do with this discussion.)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pew conducted a study of Jews in America and has released a comprehensive report based on its findings. Nearly 2800 religious Jewish people were interviewed and the results of those interviews make up the model for the results of the study. It&#8217;s difficult conduct a study like this and achieve meaningful results. I am not a statistician nor can I compare the sample sizes used in this study with others. To my untrained eye, it seems small.</p>
<p>There are many very interesting findings to discuss. I have three things I want to say about the study.</p>
<p>First, people will point to the staggering number of orthodox Jews who are no longer orthodox. That number is 52%. It seems impossible to believe. That means that over half of people raised orthodox are no longer orthodox. Think about the orthodox Jewish friends and family you know. Does it make sense to say that over half of them are no longer orthodox? I don&#8217;t think so.<span id="more-7664"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7665" alt="jew-chp3-3" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp3-3.png" />If you drill down a bit you notice a couple of things. For starters, I know many people who say they were raised orthodox because they went to a yeshiva or modern orthodox school even if they weren&#8217;t frum at home. I went to school with several people like that. Those people certainly skew the numbers. After all, the study relied on self identification. There was no process to classify people into categories other than to ask them.</p>
<p>But the real key here what the numbers are for young people being raised in contemporary orthodoxy. Those numbers are impressive. 83% of people raised as orthodox Jews under the age of 30 stay. This is a huge success. It&#8217;s also a number that correlates with anecdotal evidence. So the people who were raised orthodox and no longer are orthodox are mostly older people. What does this mean?</p>
<p>It means one of two things or perhaps a hybrid of two. [It doesn't mean that orthodox Jews leave the fold in their 30's and 40's at alarmingly high rates.] It could either mean that orthodoxy is much stronger today than it was 20 and 30 years ago. People get a better Jewish education, there is more insularity, and the shift to ultra orthodoxy which outnumbers modern orthodoxy by nearly 10:1 in this demographic is working to keep more orthodox Jews orthodox. Alternatively, it signifies a shift in who attends orthodox schools. In other words, 20-30 years ago it was far more likely for a family to send a child to an orthodox school and identify as orthodox even if they were not totally observant of halacha. There was more cross-pollination and there were fewer non-orthodox options. So you wind up with more people from previous generations identifying as being raised orthodox even though they weren&#8217;t truly orthodox through and through. This is rarer today because we are more insular and non-orthodox or unaffiliated Jews feel less comfortable in orthodox institutions. The truth is likely a combination of the two but the latter does concern me.</p>
<p>Also, very few middle aged and older people consider themselves ultra-orthodox. It&#8217;s a youth movement. Sure, some mellow out and switch affiliation. But it&#8217;s also a recent phenomena that is sweeping orthodoxy. It&#8217;s pretty compelling evidence that what is happening now for the under 40 orthodox Jew is different from what their parents and grandparents experienced. It&#8217;s a different kind of Judaism. The numbers bear it out.</p>
<p>Next, the non-orthodox denominations are falling apart. The numbers support the rumblings and rumors regarding the demise of Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism is dwindling as well. Some orthodox Jews like to cheer while these two denominations begin to disappear. Others view it as a sign that those Jews must be saved and brought into orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I think that it is important for Judaism that non-orthodox denominations are strong and vibrant. I think that orthodox Jews should be concerned and make efforts to help revive non-orthodox Judaism. This sounds controversial and heretical but it&#8217;s really not. Orthodox Judaism is not going to magically become the Judaism for the 89% of non-orthodox Jews. We can either wish them well and watch them disappear or we can try to keep them connected to their Jewish heritage. I think the latter choice is preferable. Now we can either keep them connected by &#8220;making them orthodox&#8221; as if that is even possible, or we can rely on strong non-orthodox denominations to keep them in the fold. I think the latter choice is preferable here too. It&#8217;s certainly the more likely option to achieve widespread success. While resources are precious in the orthodox community, I think strengthening the non-orthodox denominations is a worthy endeavor. They are also our brothers and sisters. If we value what we have, we should do whatever we can to help them stay somewhat connected to their Judaism. A little bit of a good thing is a whole lot better than nothing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7666" alt="jew-chp4-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp4-2-306x600.png" /></p>
<p>The last thing for now are the numbers on belief in God. 96% of ultra-orthodox Jews are <em>certain </em>that there is a God. Certain. That&#8217;s a very high number. I also wonder how they can all be so certain. The modern orthodox number is 77%. Also a very high number for certainty. 8% of ultra-orthodox Jews believe but are less certain and 19% of modern orthodox Jews fit that description. I think that both of those numbers are really higher. Most people don&#8217;t think about belief in God. They just do it. But the question wasn&#8217;t simply about belief. The question measured the certainty of the believer. I am skeptical that someone can be certain of something without being able to make a compelling argument in favor of that certainty. How many of us can make that argument? If we can&#8217;t, can we be certain? <em>(Stay tuned for an essay on this issue sometime soon.)</em></p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting numbers in this section are the numbers of people who &#8220;do not believe.&#8221; Here the number for ultra-orthodox is 1% while it is 3% for modern orthodox. Practicing Judaism under a state of disbelief s not an easy proposition. If one doesn&#8217;t think the mitzvos and traditions have Divine meaning then they are bound to become a huge burden. However, orthopraxy &#8211; practicing Judaism despite disbelief is a growing trend. I wonder what these numbers will look like in a few years. It&#8217;s possible that more people who do not believe in God will feel comfortable in orthodox Judaism and they will grow as a public group. But it&#8217;s also possible that a rise in those numbers will inspire a thorough vetting of all orthodox Jews which would force all orthoprax Jews into a closet or out of orthodox Judaism altogether.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other interesting numbers to discuss. (97% of ultra-orthodox Jews have all or mostly Jewish friends. That&#8217;s insularity! How about only 57% of orthodox Jews are Republicans? And the support for Israel numbers need addressing as well.) Perhaps I will revisit the study and more of its social commentary in a future post. For now, these are the three things that jumped out at me.</p>
<p><em>Note: The orthodox people surveyed were all from Brooklyn, Monsey, and Lakewood. I think this might be significant.</em> (EDIT: This is imprecise. Those were the oversampled counties. My apologies.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A viral-ish video (almost 3k Likes) released before Yom Kippur poked fun at the rabbi&#8217;s sermon. The video featured puppets teaching the viewer how to write a High Holiday sermon. They said to start with a joke (see here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/09/15/why-do-rabbis-make-jokes-at-serious-times/" target="_blank">Why Do Rabbis Make Jokes at Serious Times?</a>), then tell a story, then make your point, but keep it short and interesting, unless the audience wants to sleep longer, har har har. It&#8217;s classic lowbrow sarcastic humor.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the joke was &#8220;funny&#8221; because rabbi&#8217;s speeches are predictable and formulaic. Further, this is seen as a very bad thing because things that are predictable, especially rabbi&#8217;s speeches, are no good.<span id="more-7644"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7646" alt="Screen Shot 2013-09-16 at 10.23.19 PM" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-16-at-10.23.19-PM-600x501.png" /></p>
<p>People thought the video was funny. I didn&#8217;t. But I actually have a problem with the concept of the video.</p>
<p>The underlying assumption behind the joke is that speeches should not be formulaic and that rabbis should not follow a script. I think both of these assumptions are wrong.</p>
<p>Things that are formulaic can be amazing. Baseball is formulaic. Pitch, hit, catch, throw. Political speeches are formulaic. Hit the talking points, wait for applause, repeat. Movies and TV shows are formulaic. Law and Order is as formulaic as can possibly be. A good meal has an appetizer, main, a salad, and a side dish. Predictable. But delicious. Formulas can be wildly successful. Just because something has a formula hardly means that it&#8217;s not impressive or worthwhile. Some of the most successful things in our world are formulaic. Ted Talks are incredibly formulaic. And incredibly popular. It&#8217;s pedantic and petty to harp on the formula of the rabbinic sermon. It&#8217;s not a valid criticism.</p>
<p>The second assumption is also wrong. That is, rabbis are usually decent teachers and orators. But to be those things rabbis should follow a script. Rabbis are teachers not entertainers. We don&#8217;t want baseball players to juggle chainsaws and we don&#8217;t want politicians to tap dance. Why would anyone expect rabbis to do anything other than teach and lead their congregations? Why should rabbis be expected to become entertainers?</p>
<p>Sure, rabbis should attempt to spice up their talks and not be stiff or boring. But the video implies that because rabbis use a basic formula for their sermons they should be mocked. They shouldn&#8217;t. Rabbis must be creative within the bounds of the expected formula but that&#8217;s it. What do they expect? A variety show starring the rabbi? Improv? Ludicrous.</p>
<p>Spontaneity and quirkiness have their place but a sermon is neither the time nor place for either of those. Perhaps our society overvalues surprising and thinking different. Sometimes we need to not think different and certainly not to mock thinking &#8220;the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using a video to make fun of the traditional rabbinic sermon just before the High Holidays was not only in bad taste, but it only served to subvert the important role that rabbis play this time of year. It was a poor choice to produce the video and an even poorer choice to release it just before the High Holidays.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sermon formula is not going to change. Nor should it. Different rabbis will have varying levels of success at speaking from the pulpit but it will almost always be within the same framework. This video only undermines rabbis without making a case for how rabbis could even do it any differently. Rabbis are not going to sing their sermon like Operaman sings the news. Rabbis are not going to mime their sermons. Rabbis are not going to direct a three part play. They are going to speak and they are going to use common speaking techniques to get their point across. They are going to make jokes and tell stories to bolster the attention of the audience. That&#8217;s the formula. Making fun of it is just dumb.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, The Atlantic ran an article written by the loving wife of a victim of childhood sexual abuse. The article is difficult to read yet doubly rewarding. First, the appreciation for the challenges abuse victims encounter and how they affect those who love them and second, the very sweet end of the article nearly outweighs the darkness of the rest of the article.</p>
<p>I have often (naively) said that if the <em>gedolim </em>would really understand the way abuse affects its victims, it they would really comprehend the trauma and horrors of abuse they would not hesitate to report abuse to the police.<span id="more-7615"></span> I&#8217;ve been told that the <em>gedolim </em>have been made aware of the severity of abuse and to no avail. This article would be part of that presentation that I naively think would change their minds on abuse. In a very direct and practical way, this article demonstrates just how deeply the victim of abuse feels their pain. Further, it illustrates how far reaching the trauma of abuse can be. It affects so many people beyond the initial victim.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7616" alt="discriminacion-mayorias-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/discriminacion-mayorias-2-600x424.jpg" /><br />
For that reason alone I recommend reading the article.</p>
<p>But there is so much more. In a large portion of the orthodox Jewish world, young men and women meet upon the approval of their parents. Mothers and fathers vet possible date prospects for their children. They rarely know these prospective mates personally. Rather, resumes are distributed and phone calls are placed to common friends and beyond. Parents are often overwhelmed with suggestions. It&#8217;s easy enough to eliminate the damaged goods before even embarking on a thorough investigation.But unfortunately there is a negative consequence to this kind of education in the orthodox Jewish community. Because victims of abuse are dealing with so much in their lives, they can be stigmatized and shunned as potential spouses.</p>
<p>Divorced parents? No thanks. Brother is no longer frum? No thanks. Sister didn&#8217;t go to seminary? No thanks. He&#8217;s in college? No way. She&#8217;s in law school? No thanks. Baal Teshuva? No thanks. At risk teen who figured things out at around 20 years old? No thanks.</p>
<p>Superficial details that have almost zero value in determining the true nature of the prospect can eliminate the prospect from contention very early on in the process. This results in a haves and have nots environment.</p>
<p>Organic dating avoids this issue. Boys meets girl, they get on well, they get to know each other, the develop feelings for one another, and then the superficial details emerge. By that time, very few sane people would toss out a relationship because his parents are divorced or she has a brother who is not frum. The relationship is more important than those petty details.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic dating has its own set of problems that the shidduch system can help avoid. I am not arguing in favor or against shidduch dating in this post. It&#8217;s just the reality of the shidduch scene that this is what happens.</p>
<p>According to my anecdotal, non-scientific research and basic reasoning skills, one of the greatest fears that frum abuse victims have is that they will be branded as damaged goods and find themselves at the bottom of the shidduch Totem pole. It is a legitimate fear. It&#8217;s stupid, but it is probably what would to happen. If parents hear a potential shidduch candidate was abused it makes sense within the misplaced priorities and confines of the shidduch system that they would just eliminate that person from consideration immediately.</p>
<p>By contrast, the first thing you learn about someone after meeting them is usually not whether they were abused. Obviously. In a good relationship, eventually it is likely to be disclosed and discovered and most probably dealt with together. So the abuse issue only arises once there is a couple with an existing relationship. If the abuse creates an unhealthy environment for a relationship that might doom the couple. But the information alone does not torpedo the relationship like it can within the shidduch system.</p>
<p>Thus, as much as we need to educate ourselves and our communities about the horrors of abuse, we also need to be careful not to allow ourselves to think that abuse victims are damaged goods who should be placed on the bottom of the deck when it comes to shidduchim. It&#8217;s a very difficult and narrow path to navigate but it is a necessary one. One solution to this problem might be jettisoning the shidduch system. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen. Instead, I think we will need to make a conscious effort to walk this tightrope. Let victims know that we empathize with their pain and their struggles. But we also are careful to make sure that victims know that we believe in them and in their ability to lead proud, confident, and successful lives. We all have challenges in life. Victims of abuse may have struggles that are more public than others, but we all have our struggles and no one group should have their struggles written off as inferior or that their struggles should automatically disqualify them from living orthodox Jewish life at its fullest.</p>
<p>For that matter, none of the superficial shidduch disqualifications make any sense. Let&#8217;s do away with all of them. But I think the abuse issue needs attention first because of how far behind we are in handling abuse and because suffering in silence compounds the trauma of abuse.</p>
<p>Please read the article and let&#8217;s start working together on the healing process, both individual and communal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know when or exactly how or why, but at some point in my childhood I became enamored with Martin Luther King Jr. and the speech he gave 50 years ago today. I remember that one of the first things I did on the Internet was listen to the speech. I will never forget the euphoric feeling I experienced when I heard Dr. King say <em>&#8220;&#8230;when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God&#8217;s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, &#8220;Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!&#8221;<span id="more-7585"></span></em></p>
<p>The speech influenced me greatly and I had a <a href="http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf" target="_blank">faux archive version copy of the speech</a> in my childhood desk drawer.</p>
<p>Ever since then I have shared the same dream as Dr. King.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7586" alt="GTY_MLK_march_on_washington_1963_lpl_130801_16x9_608" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GTY_MLK_march_on_washington_1963_lpl_130801_16x9_608-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Content of their character. We are getting there. It&#8217;s very hard to avoid our natural biases. It&#8217;s a lifetime effort. It&#8217;s something everyone needs to work on and Dr. King calls upon us to do just that.</p>
<p>Similarly, I urge all of us to judge ideas by the content and substance of the idea and not the value we place in the person making the statement.</p>
<p>But I have a dream that in the Jewish community we can judge one another by the content of our character and not by our affiliations and style of clothing. My dream is that we can create a global Jewish community united by far more than the things that separate us.</p>
<p>One day, all Jews, no matter their belief in God, Torah M&#8217;Sinai, or the Afterlife will work together to provide positive Jewish experiences for our communities. One day, whether we are Zionist or indifferent, liberal or conservative,  we can form a united Jewish nation. One day, mystics and rationalists, GRAniks and chasidim will dance together. One day it won&#8217;t matter who one&#8217;s grandparents were or which town one&#8217;s family came from in Europe or &#8220;God forbid,&#8221; if they came from one of the Arab countries.</p>
<p>Dr. King&#8217;s dream resonates with all of us. It gives us hope for a better future. A future where pettiness and narcissism give way to tolerance and empathy. That is my dream.</p>
<p>How do we get there? We fight against drawing imaginary lines that only serve to divide us. We argue for the rights of those who are under-represented within our ranks. We strive to give our children every opportunity to succeed and find meaningful, joyous, passionate Judaism that is inclusive, understanding, and loving. We reach out to our ideological opponents and offer them friendship with no strings attached. We explore innovative and comprehensive solutions to our social problems instead of applying bandaids to severed limbs.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a dream. But it&#8217;s a dream I believe in strongly. It is a dream worth fighting for. It is a dream that Dr. King inspired in a little boy who grew up to be me.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, the speech echoes through my brain. It&#8217;s message cuts through the noise and sings a beautiful song of hope. Thank you Dr. King for inspiring generations of people and thank you for inspiring me with the greatest speech I have ever had the privilege to hear. On its 50th anniversary we say thank you.</p>
<p>I hope we will live to see your dream come true and all of our dreams as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An interview with Rabbi Mendel Epstein has gone viral. The protagonist of the article is Rabbi Epstein, a man who has dedicated his life to helping women navigate the rough waters of Jewish divorce. He is a professional to&#8217;ein (Jewish for lawyer) and advocates for women. He has a lot of insight. He also carries a bias. We all do. There&#8217;s no crime in bias. But it&#8217;s important that we know what we are dealing with.<span id="more-7576"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7580" alt="82507772MB023_2008_Republic" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bill-of-Rights1-600x296.jpg" /></p>
<p>In terms of substance, I agree with a lot of what Rabbi Epstein says. Obviously. Who wouldn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>He comes off a bit paternalistic at times. He&#8217;s also working in a very male dominated social environment so some of what he says sounds uncomfortable to more modern ears. I think it&#8217;s clear that he is talking about a fairly insular charedi community. Most of the modern orthodox or even centrist yeshiva type people I know are fully aware of these things and don&#8217;t need to be informed or even reminded to treat their wives respectfully.</p>
<p>Four items in his &#8220;Bill of Rights&#8221; for Orthodox Jewish wives are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(1) A wife must be treated with respect and not be abused. A woman in an abusive relationship has a right to seek a get.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(2) She is entitled to be supported by her husband. Read the kesubah.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(3) A husband is obligated to honor and respect his wife’s parents.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(4) She is entitled to a normal conjugal relationship.</p>
<p>He also cites some very specious anecdotal evidence about divorce and infidelity that sound exaggerated. He basically tries to assert the &#8220;it might lead to mixed dancing&#8221; argument as fact.</p>
<p>But here is the real problem. What kind of society needs to be told these things? How is this all not patently obvious? What kind of world needs a rabbi to affirm these basic principles?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as if Rabbi Epstein is saying that there a few people who need to be reminded or scolded about these things. He seems to be saying that this Bill of Rights is necessary for our entire society. This makes me ill.</p>
<p>We tout our communities as safe havens from the dysfunction on the outside. But is it true? Is there dysfunction on the outside? Are we functioning better? These are very difficult claims to answer. Rabbi Epstein seems to be poking a hole in our armor. It seems that in some ways we need to look to the outside as our guide on how to behave. Ask any middle-class, educated, family orientated person about marriage and there is no doubt that they will echo Rabbi Epstein&#8217;s supposed bombshell.</p>
<p>But how does this happen? How is it that we are falling behind?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that we have demonized the outside so much in our communities and educational systems that we passively reject whatever they espouse. We gloss over חכמה בגויים תאמין. We think that we have the answers and they don&#8217;t. Eventually this leads us to a place where we tune out the good ideas and advice from the outside and bad habits and poor social standards become set in our communities.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that there are many people who need to hear this Bill of Rights. But I also don&#8217;t doubt that anyone normal would agree with them. So why does it need to be said? It has to be that we simply ignore these issues. Why are we ignoring them if the rest of modern society is addressing them? There is no satisfactory answer to this question.</p>
<p>One more thing. Rabbi Epstein places too much faith in the Beis Din system. I have never in my entire life heard of someone who had a positive Beis Din experience. It seems extremely unlikely that a woman&#8217;s best course of action is to go to a Beis Din that requires both parties to agree to a binding arbitration. The problems with our Beis Din system are well known and it&#8217;s a disservice to his audience that Rabbi Esptein recommends entering into this basically corrupt system. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/18/restoring-credibility-to-the-beis-din-system/" target="_blank">Restoring Credibility to the Beis Din System</a>.</p>
<p>The article ends with a call for action and ideas for solutions. I think it&#8217;s pretty simple. Reinstitute חכמה בגויים תאמין. Start learning from the outside. Read secular books of marriage and intimacy. Pay attention to what psychologist, marriage therapists, and secular experts say. Rabbis have to stop dismissing everything that comes from outside the Beis Medrash. We can learn a lot from experts on these matters, especially intimacy. We have to start respecting people outside our community and not believing as a matter of faith that a <em>yarmulka</em> and a <em>sheitel</em> and a <em>vort</em> and a 500 guest wedding and <em>sheva brachos</em> and <em>shana rishona</em> are going to magically make for great marriages and happy couples.</p>
<p>There are many very happy marriages within our community. There are also many happy marriages outside our community. We can learn from them. We should learn from them. Hopefully we can arrive at a place where we can laugh at the absolute silliness of a Bill of Rights that says not to abuse women, to provide for one&#8217;s family, and to be intimate with one&#8217;s wife. I hope we get there soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another voice has entered the online discussion about Bible Criticism and orthodox Judaism. Professor Jacob L. Wright is an orthodox Jew who has studied, taught, and written extensively on Bible Criticism.</p>
<p>He made waves Pesach time when he published a provocative article on the Huffington Post where he talked about &#8220;The Myth of Moses.&#8221; In his article he explained that his view of the Bible is that it is a composite work with each layer added for a specific reason. In the Moses story, there was a need to justify the existence of an Egyptian prince named Moses who saved the Israelites and establish him as a bona fide Israelite. So the Bible tells the story of a boy who was cast off by his mother into the Nile. This story has very obscure references as the names of the major players in the story are not mentioned. Later, the story was viewed as salacious so new details were added as a prologue to the story.<span id="more-7473"></span></p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t the Bible and I weren&#8217;t orthodox, this would be a great theory to explain anomalies in the text. But it is the Bible and I am orthodox so it hardly sits well with me when the Bible is explained away as myth.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7475" alt="157328845" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/157328845-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p>Professor Wright was interview by Professor Alan Brill on his <a href="http://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/08/19/interview-with-prof-jacob-wright-of-emory-university/" target="_blank">Kavvanah</a> website. The interview is worth your time and consideration if you don&#8217;t mind reading what is widely considered to be absolute kefira.</p>
<p>The first important thing in the interview is the introduction where Brill outlines the current status of Biblical Criticism. It&#8217;s required reading so I copy it in full here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As background, the problems of the Bible go back to the tenth and eleventh century Islamic critiques of the Bible by Ibn Hazm and others. Second, modern figures such as Spinoza and Jean Astruc sought to understand the Bible as a human book using the same tools that we use to understand Greek and Roman books. And in the 19th century, Wellhausen popularized a theory that the Pentateuch had four authors. But the important part of his theory was that the ritual and priestly material was a priestly Pharisaic digression from the original pure faith of the prophets necessitating Christianity for a restoration. Hence, Solomon Schechter called it higher anti-Semitism, David Zvi Hoffman showed that Leviticus is not in contradiction to the rest of the story, Kaufman showed that the prophets assumed the priestly material, and Cassuto showed based on Sumerian and Akkadian sources that the divisions fail.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Well, Wellhausen was writing a century ago, with the aforementioned defenses all formulated in a post WWI climate. For at least forty years the field was already given to authors such as Gunkel who assumes the Bible is legend, the way Gilgamesh is legend. And Martin Noth who assumed most of the narrative was formulated originally as oral traditions- read here. Questions of redaction were not tied to Wellhausen, or even literary documents, but to oral traditions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What do historians currently think about the context of the Bible? They assume that it was written between 720 BCE and 587 BCE, between the destruction of the Northern Kingdom destruction of Jerusalem, with some editing until the end of Ezra’s life circa 440 BCE. (Minimalists make it more recent and Evangelicals defend the chronological dates.) They work from parallels to Assyrian texts, the nature of script, linguistics, and reconstructed context of author. Little of this has anything to do with literary doublets. If you want to reject historical criticism, then start learning ancient linguistics and texts contemporary to the Bible. No harmonization of passages changes this dating nor does anything from Cassutto or Hoffman affect it. (However, Prof. Josh Berman is seeking to shift the discussion from Assyrians to the Hittites in 1300 BCE, an effort that may be accepted by the Orthodox but does not promise to have much of an impact on the experts. But it is better than refuting Kugel, who is not a historian of ancient Israel or source critic so the critique does not help.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This past May there was a major conference at Hebrew University on“Convergence and Divergence in Pentateuchal Theory;” if you are interested in these topics, then that was the place to be. The conference opened up with a clear statement that there are three approaches: a Documentary approach (not based on Wellhausen but on Noth and others) where there are separate documents; a Supplementary approach,where a single document get more and more complex; and a Fragmentary approach, where we cannot separate out authors or layers anymore.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finally returning to Cassuto, he may have rejected Wellhausen but he accepted historical context, showing that all the numbers and genealogies in Genesis do not correspond to ages and events, rather are stylized number, ten generations, twelve children. He does this by reading the ancient parallels to the Biblical story.<br />
Wright answers Brill&#8217;s various questions and hte discussion is fascinating and worth your time.</p>
<p>However I would like to focus on the end of the interview. Here, Brill asks the million dollar question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>How can one be a shomer Torah uMizvot and accept historical criticism?</em></p>
<p>Wright basically dodges the question by attacking those who attack Biblical Criticism without a background in the field. He also reassures the reader that there are plenty of scholars who are shomer Torah u&#8217;Mitzvos. Wright reiterates the question and fails to provide a sufficient answer. If anything his answer strengthens the question. He answers that he is in awe of the authors of the Bible. Their genius makes it a compelling work. In conclusion the Torah is authoritative but not divine.</p>
<p>I tried to follow up in the comments and ask why anyone would feel compelled to adhere to an ancient man made book of rules. Wright replied that the Torah as divine origins but is not divine. I was eventually directed to Gideon Slifkin&#8217;s Facebook page where Wright says he went into more detail. I followed instructions but the discussion there did not deliver.</p>
<p>This is the crux of the issue. In mainstream frum circles today, from Satmar and Lakewood to YU and Merkaz HaRav, the assumption is that if the Torah is not approximately 99.99% of what God gave Moses at Sinai then people would not keep the Torah. That is the basic assumption. The fear of Bible Criticism is that it assumes (or even purports to prove) that the Torah is not 100% divine. Some scholars say it&#8217;s 0% divine, but that is not a necessary assumption to Bible Criticism. The only way Bible Criticism will ever be accepted in mainstream frum circles is if this assumption about keeping the Torah changes. If this assumption is replaced with the assumption that people will keep the Torah even if the Torah we have today is a composite work based on an original divine revelation at Sinai then the fear of Bible Criticism disappears.</p>
<p>As an aside, I see no reason to think that this assumption (i.e. that even if God is not responsible for 100% of the Torah we would keep the Torah) could not work. We keep plenty of things that are not from God. We keep all the Rabbinic Mitzvos and many customs on top of those as well. So I think there is no reason that the current assumption is unimpeachable and unchangeable.</p>
<p>The challenge will be carving out a version of Biblical Criticism that doesn&#8217;t undermine our mandate that we keep the Torah but allows for subsequent emendations and additions. Is it possible? Not yet. It will only become a possibility once we as a collective group realize that the Torah need not be 100% from God in order for us to keep it. But once the current assumption is replaced with the new assumption I think we will see Bible Criticism seep into the frum community as an acceptable form of study. As a matter of comparison, Talmudic criticism was once considered taboo and is gaining slow acceptance in some frum circles.</p>
<p>For all the uproar over R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s position, I feel that his is far more tenable than Wright&#8217;s position on this issue. R&#8217; Farber holds that prophets made additions to the original text of the Torah. This is extremely controversial, but at least God is the one doing the writing, albeit through God&#8217;s prophets. Wright&#8217;s version has too much human interference to be taken seriously as a document that requires our attention. His basic approach is that if it&#8217;s meaningful we will do it no matter where it comes from. This is weak and I doubt it would survive more than a couple generations at most.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the assumption about what it takes for people to keep the Torah is far too limiting. Once it expands I think we will see an increase in Bible Criticism that is acceptable in frum circles. I hope we can get there before we lose too many people based on the wrong assumptions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years of research and development, a man-made hamburger was publicly tasted for the first time last week. The burger was not animal flesh, instead it was grown in a laboratory. However, it was grown in a way that mimics the way animals grow their own flesh. Thus, it was pretty close to dead animal meat in flavor and texture.</p>
<p>This incredible scientific breakthrough prompted a plethora of questions. For the religious community with rituals and laws attached to the eating of meat even more questions were asked.<span id="more-7459"></span></p>
<p>It seemed that one could hardly browse the Internet for five seconds without seeing a juicy soundbite (sorry, couldn&#8217;t resist) about whether the meat was kosher or whether is was meat at all. Chabad&#8217;s website had one approach. OU had another approach. Reuters had a third opinion in their article. NBC added another view.</p>
<p>I must have been asked by a dozen people what to make of the man-made meat mystery.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7460" alt="k-bigpic" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/k-bigpic-600x337.gif" /></p>
<p>This is what I think. No one has any idea what they are talking about. Non-scientists have no chance of understanding the precise manner in which this meat was manufactured. I have tried to understand how it all works and it is almost impossible to find the full technical explanation with all the requisite background information. A very smart scientists tried explaining it to me, but even after I got the gist of the process I had more questions about stem cells and other background than I had before he explained it to me. I am pretty confident that Chabad, OU, the Reuters people, and even NBC News reporters don&#8217;t have a clue how this meat is made.</p>
<p>Sure, they  say &#8220;don&#8217;t rely on this for halacha&#8221; or something to that effect, but that makes things even worse. Why offer a meaningless opinion that is based on ignorance? It seems to make a mockery of Jewish law. But Jewish law is very serious and serious people will offer serious opinions on this matter. The proper response for almost the entire population of planet Earth to these eternal questions about man-made meat is &#8220;I am not qualified to render an opinion on this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a thorough understanding of how the meat is made, any discussion of the halachic ramifications of the meat is not even conjecture. It is pure fantasy. Further, deciding the halachic status of this issue will require a breadth of Torah knowledge that is possessed by a mere handful of people on the planet. You can&#8217;t <em>pasken</em> this <em>shyla</em> with Yad Moshe, Google, or the Otzar. This is a brand new question of Jewish law and will need serious investigation into the science and the various tenuously analogous precedents in Jewish law. The Torah does not discuss synthetic meat. And even if it did, who says this meat would be the same as the synthetic meat found in Jewish law?</p>
<p>The only way this question can be seriously answered is with a conference of scientists and rabbis who fit the descriptions above. Scientists who can thoroughly explain how the meat is made and Torah scholars who know <em>kol haTorah kula</em> will need to decide this issue. Anyone else jumping into the discussion is wielding a knife in a nuclear war. It&#8217;s that useless.</p>
<p>If I can, I will try to attain a scientific understanding of how this meat is produced and then perhaps I will be qualified to even ask the question to my (qualified) <em>posek.</em> But until such time, I wouldn&#8217;t dare wade into this very, very deep pool. I think this is the proper policy under the circumstances. We sound more educated and cutting edge when we admit what we don&#8217;t know as opposed to when we pretend we know what we are discussing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am reluctant to write a post just to respond to a random &#8220;heartfelt plea&#8221; that was circulating on the Internet yesterday. In the letter, a single woman asks her friends for more understanding and in a series of contradictory instructions dispensed advice for her friends. I won&#8217;t respond to her letter. It&#8217;s too raw and too much emotion for a fair response.</p>
<p>In truth, the substance of the letter is irrelevant. Clearly the woman is in a lot of pain. She admits that she is basically &#8220;losing it&#8221; and it&#8217;s difficult to read the letter and not feel her suffering.</p>
<p>I have two things to say.<span id="more-7445"></span></p>
<p>The letter indicates that she desperately wants children. She doesn&#8217;t seem to care very much for a husband. According to my research this is not an uncommon sentiment. Young women who are looking to get married seem to be more focused on babies than men.</p>
<p>It could be argued that cohabitation with a male mate is just a mechanism for procreation and anything more is an unnecessary distraction. Modern people don&#8217;t think like that anymore. We view marriage as an opportunity for love. Finding a life partner has become a very important part of our culture. It didn&#8217;t happen in a vacuum either. Chazal already taught us that there must be attraction between husband and wife. It would seem like something worth looking forward to.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7446" alt="6a00d83452b15969e201910440d838970c-800wi" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/6a00d83452b15969e201910440d838970c-800wi.jpg" /></p>
<p>So why doesn&#8217;t she feel the need to find a husband? Two reasons jump out at me and both of these reasons speak to broad social issues.</p>
<p>She is reacting to what her friends are doing and talking about. Her friends talk about their kids. Her friends apparently don&#8217;t talk about their husbands. This is normal in the frum community. It&#8217;s not socially acceptable to talk about one&#8217;s spouse to others in any familiar way. If a spouse is mentioned, it&#8217;s very sterile and certainly not intimate. This is a function of tznius standards. It&#8217;s not bad per se but we can see a possible negative consequence of this strict silence on husbands and wives. It could be that single people don&#8217;t even realize that there is any beauty in a loving spousal relationship. They don&#8217;t hear about it from their friends and sometimes it can be hard to see it in one&#8217;s parents. Perhaps it would be wise to emphasize this aspect of marriage a bit more in our communities.</p>
<p>The second reason I think she may not be looking for a husband is because of the general approach toward men in the frum community. Women (and even men) are taught that men are basically animals. Women are taught (incorrectly) that they must dress modesty so that men do not sin. Men are told not to look at women because it will cause them to sin. Is it any wonder that young women are not looking forward to a relationship with one of these beasts? The discourse must change. We cannot talk about men in this way and we cannot teach tznius in a way that reinforces this negative portrayal. Maybe young women will actually want to get married for the sake of being in a relationship with a life partner.</p>
<p>The second point I want to make is that it should not be debilitating to be single. The frum community values marriage so greatly that it seems impossible to be a happy, well-adjusted, successful single woman. By broadcasting the importance of marriage, and it is important, we may also be projecting negativity toward single women. I think it would be good for our community to find a way to create a safe and productive place for single women. We should not be defining ourselves purely by marital and child bearing status. There is so much that needs to be done in our world. Single women can do so much. Minimizing them into potential baby makers is dehumanizing and we can see how it feels to be left out of the baby making party.</p>
<p>I feel for this woman. I really do. But I think we didn&#8217;t prepare her for this and we should be doing better for our singles. Being single is not a disease. It may not be ideal but it can be a great time in one&#8217;s life and great things can be accomplished. We need to figure out a way to make this happen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new issue of The New Republic cover story is about us. It is about Haredim, modern Orthodox, and women. These are things we discuss regularly online and at our Shabbos tables, and in our coffee rooms. The story is remarkably accurate and balanced, displaying a very deep understanding of the issues in Israel today. I recommend reading the article immediately.</p>
<p>Imagine a spectrum of religious fundamentalism in the orthodox Jewish community. On one end you have extreme Haredi sects and on the other end you have completely secular Israelis. On most things and for most of time the people in the middle, let&#8217;s call them modern orthodox, skewed their allegiences toward the Haredi side. Orthodoxy is the great uniter. The assumption is that any two orthodox people will have more common interests than an orthodox and a secular Jew. This is how things were.<span id="more-7442"></span></p>
<p>In essence, the article argues that while naturally aligned with their fellow orthodox Jews, women from the modern orthodox community in Israel are finding themselves aligned with secular feminist Jews in Israel. The collective pain that is felt due to the oppressiveness toward women in the extreme and not so extreme Haredi world is taking a toll. Women have been attacked physically, verbally, and psychologically for a long time and it is starting to create a negative reaction.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7443" alt="article_inset_lithwick_2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/article_inset_lithwick_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Several times the article mentions signs that tell women how to dress. We have become accustomed to these signs. But the women in the article argue that the signs give license to thugs who want to make a statement to women. To them, the signs mean much more than &#8220;Please be sensitive to our religious beliefs.&#8221; Part of that is because these standards are entering the public sphere and are no longer just limited to the private insular neighborhoods. But the other part of it is that the signs are somehow justifying the negativity and violence toward women.</p>
<p>What has happened is that women who feel hurt and abused are turning to secular and Reform Jews for salvation. Feminism is a dirty word in many orthodox communities, even in some places within the modern orthodox community. But it&#8217;s becoming a necessary evil for modern orthodox women who are not feminists at all to ask for help from feminists. It&#8217;s odd when orthodox people are funding they have more in common with secular and very liberal Jews than fellow orthodox Jews. But that is what is happening.</p>
<p>The article also talks about modern orthodox women who sympathize with the Women of the Wall. I wish they would be more vocal but i was heartened to hear it.</p>
<p>Last week I wrote about finding common ground and room for dialogue between modern orthodox and yeshivish Jews in America. (See:<br />
<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/08/02/maybe-rabbi-birnbaum-has-a-point-a-solution/">Maybe Rabbi Birnbaum Has a Point: A Solution</a>) I think what we are seeing in the article in TNR is what will happen if we can&#8217;t work together. If the people in the middle start to feel like the liberal and secular Jews are more sympathetic to their way of life, the great split that has been predicted for years, will finally happen. Modern orthodox Judaism will become an independent group.</p>
<p>Some might say, what&#8217;s so bad about that? Well there are plenty negative consequences to mention. But I will mention the two biggest issues. First, the Haredi institutions will fall without modern orthodox support. Some might say that&#8217;s not so bad either. I disagree. Their services are necessary, as is their trap door into engagement with society. On the other side, without a connection the Haredi community, the modern orthodox community will be hard pressed to support its own institutions for lack of qualified teachers and rabbis.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not in our best interests to see a formal split. It might happen in Israel and it might happen in America. I think we should do everything we can to prevent it. The first thing we need to do, is get together and talk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An area of intense debate has historically been whether people are born good or are born sinners or are born neither? Similarly, is our moral compass natural or is it nurtured? Questions like these have been tackled by philosophers and religions for a long time.</p>
<p>Some Christian denominations talk of Original Sin. Generally speaking, this means that Adam&#8217;s sin in the Garden of Eden caused all humans to be born with a negative impulse. This sounds like our version of the Yetzer Hara (Evil Inclination). We say a child is born with a Yetzer Hara that pulls the child in toward sin and upon reaching the age of adulthood one receives the Yetzer Tov (Good Inclination) that pulls us to be virtuous.<span id="more-7414"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7418" alt="sweet_baby" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sweet_baby-600x375.jpg" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard and often repeated an idea from R&#8217; Moti Berger that this Yetzer Hara refers to selfishness. We are born thinking about our immediate needs and desires with no appreciation for consequences to the detriment of others and even to our own personal long term detriment. This is another way of expressing the same principle.</p>
<p>Religions seem to prefer the idea that we are born with a negative tendency and our religious education and training prepare us to battle our Yetzer Hara. As we grow and learn throughout life we are expected to shrink our negative influences and increase the strength of our positive influence.</p>
<p>This afternoon I saw a R&#8217; Wolpe Tweet that referenced the video (from a few months back on 60 minutes) at the bottom of this post. R&#8217; Wolpe says:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Modern studies prove the Rabbis got human nature exactly right: we have both a good and evil inclination:  <a href="https://t.co/SF2uKx7Ra1">https://t.co/SF2uKx7Ra1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; David Wolpe (@RabbiWolpe) <a href="https://twitter.com/RabbiWolpe/statuses/361973858087084032">July 29, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I am pretty sure that Chazal talked about being born with the Yetzer Hara and being granted a Yetzer Tov later in life. So I think R&#8217; Wolpe may be incorrect on that point. But I watched the video and I think he mischaracterizes the study as well. In the end, I think the study does support Chazal&#8217;s teaching. But in the way that they actually said it.</p>
<p>The study does not show that we are born with good and evil inclinations. It shows that babies have the ability to prefer certain choices. Those preferences can be based on a toy that seems nice, or a toy that did not help a toy that is not nice, or a toy that like the same things as them. I think it actually reinforces the idea that babies are self interested creatures and they want to be around things that will serve them well. This is what Chazal said. This is supported by the study.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing here is that they can understand what it means to be nice and that they can make choices based on that. But there is no indication that babies have a good inclination. All their good choices were self serving. This is not a bad thing. Not at all. But I think it&#8217;s a fairer way of describing the findings.</p>
<p>The video explains why people make hurtful or harmful decisions as a natural result of bias. We prefer things like us or things that share our likes and we are wired to be okay with punishing those who are outside our group. This video shows that it is natural to prefer things that are similar to us and this is clearly the root of racism. The trick to eliminating racism is to teach ourselves not to see the color of a person when our minds are determining whether another person is similar or different.</p>
<p>One thing I would like clarified is how the researchers know that these are naturally occurring thoughts and feelings. It seems to me that it&#8217;s just as possible that babies are fast learners and can learn these things from the people around them.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the study shows that we learn how to be selfless and giving as we get older. I actually cried at the end of this video (around 11:30). I won&#8217;t tell you why, but I hope you feel the same way I do.</p>
<p>The video taught me that society does a good job of teaching selflessness and that we value selflessness as we mature. To me, this is the greatest thing we can teach our children. Don&#8217;t rely on society to teach this to them, but it seems that even society is getting it right. It&#8217;s hard to argue with the data here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NY Times reports that there is a religious group that is losing even some of its most committed members because of what they are finding on the Internet. Sound familiar? The group is not orthodox Judaism, rather it is the Mormons.</p>
<p>Some people are quick to point out that orthodox Judaism is suffering a similar fate. According to the narrative, people get online, they see that their religion can be challenged and that there are many other perspectives in the world, and sometimes they leave. We discussed this in the context of the chasidic world here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/22/can-judaism-survive-the-internet/">Can Judaism Survive the Internet?</a>)</p>
<p>Mormons are finding that their religion is so nascent, their beliefs are based on so many contradictions and inconsistencies, and their prophet was a less than admirably role model, that their faith is irrevocably shaken. Some leave. Others stay and want to modernize it.<span id="more-7410"></span></p>
<p>In the context of chasidic Judaism I think the comparison is somewhat fair. The lifestyle is a fairly recent innovation, the beliefs can seem contradictory at times, and for some, finding out that a shtreimel is not holy can shake their faith. The Internet might be &#8220;to blame&#8221; for those people discovering that they have options.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7411" alt="google_1674887b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/google_1674887b-600x375.jpg" /></p>
<p>But I think most people who leave and use the Internet as a tool to assist them in their journey are bothered by social issues in the community. They dislike the lifestyle, or they think the leadership is corrupt, or the allure of freedom from religion is too great. For them, the Internet is more like a lobby where they can meet likeminded people. The Internet doesn&#8217;t cause the doubt, but it helps them deal with it and sometime it helps them leave.</p>
<p>The last few days have demonstrated another Internet driven issue in orthodox Judaism.  A local issue can become a global issue. A rabbi who writes controversial things becomes international news. Further, the materials that form the substance of his controversial statements are available for anyone to read. The challenges can be found on plenty of websites. The charges of heresy can be found on several websites as well.</p>
<p>However there is a disconnect. The Internet is the great liberator of minds. Being told what to think doesn&#8217;t really work anymore. Anyone can do their own research. In fact, R&#8217; Gordimer&#8217;s original article was using data that was a week old and required a simple click to verify if it was current. Obviously people called him on it. It&#8217;s so easy to do research today. We can verify and fact check and myth bust with ease. If a yeshiva student in the Mir circa 1967 wanted to read Biblical Criticism, where would he even go? But now, it&#8217;s all available. Google is a click away. People can read it for themselves. That was the thinking behind <a href="http://thetorah.com" target="_blank">TABS</a>. Provide a safe place to read Biblical Criticism in the context of orthodox Judaism. R&#8217; Farber was trying do that. Did he go too far? Is there such a thing as too far? These are the questions being addressed across the Internet right now.</p>
<p>The point is that drawing lines in the sand while expecting skeptics to just &#8220;listen&#8221; is so 1980s. It doesn&#8217;t work anymore. People can just look at the information and make their own determination. Perhaps many of these people are not qualified to make such judgments. But that doesn&#8217;t stop them.</p>
<p>While it is laudable that Cross-Currents is trying to address this issue, in my opinion they are not addressing it at all. Instead we are being told what to think without being told why. The only why we have heard is that if we think like R&#8217; Farber there will be dire consequences. Is that sufficient? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>The Internet is not going away. The questions that R&#8217; Farber addressed will be on the Internet forever. And there are more. The best defense I have seen so far is on TABS. The reason it is the best is because is simply because it is the only defense so far. We can lament the lack of scholars in the frum community willing to address these questions in the terms they are asked. But all we have to show for it are lamentations. Still no answers or explanations.</p>
<p>From the NY Times article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Mr. Mattsson said that when he started sharing what he had learned with other Mormons in Sweden, the stake president (who oversees a cluster of congregations) told him not to talk about it to any members, even his wife and children. He did not obey: “I said to them, why are you afraid for the truth?”</em></p>
<p>We say we have the truth. We should be trying to figure out how to reconcile it with other truths, not saying &#8220;we have the truth&#8221; so loudly that we are incapable of hearing anything else.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most important discussion in orthodox Judaism right now is the pair of articles written by R&#8217; Zev Farber. The articles have been deemed heresy by R&#8217; Gordimer on Cross-Currents. If you are averse to reading anything that might touch on issues and ideas that are possibly heretical please stop reading and pick up a Nesivos Shalom or something.</p>
<p>Still here? Okay. The two articles say different things so I&#8217;d like to briefly address the <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2013/07/18/from-openness-to-heresy/" target="_blank">Cross-Currents post</a> as it relates to the &#8220;<a href="http://thetorah.com/devarim-recounting-different/" target="_blank">short article.</a>&#8221; This article went through two versions. R&#8217; Gordimer&#8217;s article used the first version which was more objectionable. R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s article was edited a full week before the article on Cross-Currents was published. I find this to be egregious. If you are going to call someone a heretic, possibly the worst thing to call an orthodox Jew, you best be sure that every detail of your case is accurate.<span id="more-7405"></span></p>
<p>The original version said this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The simplest explanation for these differences between the accounts in Exodus-Numbers and Deuteronomy is that they were penned by (at least) two different authors with different conceptions of the desert experience.</em></p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Despite sharing many details with the desert story as told in Exodus and Numbers, there is no way to make the two versions work with each other without unreasonably stretching the meaning of the texts. Whether it be the description of the scout story, the reaction of the Edomites and Moabites to Israel’s request, or the legitimacy of dwelling in the Transjordan, the two versions work with contradictory assumptions.</em></p>
<p>I can see why R&#8217; Gordimer thinks this is heresy. I don&#8217;t think it has to be as will be discussed later. But the second version is almost certainly not heresy. This is the revised version:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Despite sharing many details with the desert story as told in Exodus and Numbers, there appears to be no way to make the two versions work with each other without unreasonably stretching the meaning of the texts. The simplest literary approach is the academic one which posits multiple authors with multiple traditions. How such an approach meshes with traditionalist belief requires serious thought but it is necessary to start by recognizing the simplicity and straightforwardness of the academic approach.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7406" alt="Bible1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bible1.jpg" /></p>
<p>There is nothing remarkable about this statement. It simply states that the academic approach is simpler. Simpler is not necessarily more truthful. Thus, there is no value judgment on whether the academic approach is preferable. I hope that if this was the only thing R&#8217; Farber said, it would not have created a controversy. I hope. For this reason, I am disappointed in the Cross-Currents article.</p>
<p>However, whenever I raise this point I am reminded of the other &#8220;<a href="http://thetorah.com/torah-history-judaism-introduction/" target="_blank">long article</a>&#8221; where the heresy is stronger and harder to wiggle out of.</p>
<p>On to the second article.</p>
<p>This is R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s worldview. It is his Grand Theory of Everything. His goal is clear. R&#8217; Farber wants very badly to harmonize all the things he has taken for granted as an orthodox Jew, his adherence to halacha and social orthodoxy, with modern Biblical Criticism. This is his goal and it is important to begin with an appreciation of his assumptions.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Farber takes the challenges presented by Bible critics very seriously. It&#8217;s hard not to take them seriously. They are asking good questions. It&#8217;s true that we have &#8220;frum&#8221; answers for most of these questions and some of the questions are not so bothersome. Yet, the challenges exist.</p>
<p>The maximalist Bible critic answer is the text is not Divine. It is a text that comes from people and therefore any anomaly is understood as poor editing by a later redactor. The various writers have different agendas and their works reflect their personal biases.</p>
<p>The maximalist orthodox Jewish answer is that the text is Divine. It is a text that comes from God and therefore any anomaly is understood as part of the infinite wisdom of the Author of the Torah. The different versions of stories and laws reflect Divine intent to teach us everything we need to know.</p>
<p>There is a huge chasm between these two approaches. They share nothing other than the questions that they ask.</p>
<p>But most thinking people know that the maximalist orthodox Jewish position is untenable. No one really thinks that. The people who do are &#8220;mesorah maximalists&#8221; who will hide from the truth to support their position. The Talmud discusses the last few verses of Devarim. Chazal had a different midpoint to their Torah scrolls. Ezra reconciled the texts of several versions of Torah scrolls. Maimonides reconciled errors he found in Torah scrolls using the Aleppo Codex. Rashi had at least one discrepancy in his Torah scroll. Ibn Ezra famously said that there are twelve places in the Chumash that speak in present tense and those were not written by Moses.</p>
<p>In other words, we know that some parts of the Chumash were not spoken by God to Moses. That&#8217;s certainly acceptable in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>We also know that there is a dispute about the very nature of the book of Devarim. The Ramban says it was given word for word from God to Moses at Sinai. Others say Moses spoke these words as prophecy. Contrasted with the rest of the Chumash, it is more similar to the books of the prophets than Sefer Vayikra in this respect. The Avnei Nezer says that Devarim is a bridge between the Written Law and the Oral Law as it is Moshe&#8217;s discourse where he darshens the first four books of the Chumash.</p>
<p>The point is obvious. Devarim is treated differently by the Medieval commentators. The maximalist orthodox Jewish answer is not a reasonable position. Legitimate sources recognize this and we must recognize this as well. The question I wish to address is why. Why do we find these sort of opinions about Devarim and other scattered examples throughout the Chumash?</p>
<p>There are two possible answers. I think here we find a difference of opinion loosely based on affiliation. Charedim subscribe to one view and non-charedim subscribe to another.</p>
<p>Charedim are more apt to say that God included all aforementioned items when God gave the Torah to Moses. God told Moses to make the book of Devarim sound different. It was part of God&#8217;s plan that errors rf anachronisms creep into the text for the sake of the answers that would be given later. They were latent in the text the entire time but were waiting for the right people to reveal them.</p>
<p>Non-Charedim are more likely to take a different approach. This alternative approach holds that things may have happened after revelation and great Torah authorities used their wisdom and Torah knowledge to answer the questions in the best way they know how. This means that the issues that forced the hand of the great sages were the result of history, scribal errors, or any other circumstance that could have caused the problems. The answers are true to Torah because of the people who said them and their universal acceptance by the greater Jewish people.</p>
<p>We could say the same thing about the drashos we find in Chazal whether they be Halachic or Aggadic. One way of looking at it is that these drashos were latent in the text, they were always there, they were always kept, they were just &#8220;revealed&#8221; by the various tanaim and amoraim. The other view is that these drashos were Chazal&#8217;s way of dealing with textual and perhaps social or religious issues. They could have learned differently, but they chose to learn this way. The drashos that gained consensus became Torah. This approach certainly rings true when studying the Talmud.</p>
<p>Why did one opinion in the Talmud say that the last verses in Devarim were not written by Moses? Because he had a mesorah? Or was it simply the easiest solution to a very obvious problem? I think it is more elegent to sat that he saw a problem and this was his solution. To say otherwise means that at some point the mesorah was lost and a disagreement developed and the rabbis were merely reporters of their tradition as opposed to Torah giants with ideas of their own.</p>
<p>It is possible that the version I ascribe to more charedi orthodox Jews is correct. But I don&#8217;t think it is correct. It&#8217;s hard to believe that Chazal came along and just explained what was already known to everyone. But even if the charedi version is correct with regard to Chazal, it is almost certainly not correct with regard to the rishonim.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard people say that Rashi on Chumash is a semi-prophetic work. Rashi was Divinely inspired to comment on each verse and his commentary reflects God&#8217;s intended interpretation of the verses. This is a disservice to Rashi. It seems to me that Rashi saw inconsistencies or anomolies in the text and he chose his preferred interpretations from his vast knowledge of Chazal&#8217;s teachings. Rashi saw a problem and Rashi provided the solution.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s easier to see where this is taking us by looking at Ibn Ezra and Rambam. Why did the Ibn Ezra say that there are 7 places in the Chumash that are not original to the text? Was it something handed down to him from his teachers? I don&#8217;t think so. I am fairly certain that Ibn Ezra saw a problem in the text, there was evidence that contravened the accepted (or maybe it wasn&#8217;t accepted at that time) wisdom that every word of the Torah was given to Moses by God and those were the exact same words they had in the 11th century Torah scrolls. His solution was to accept the evidence and change the dogma. Religion cannot contradict truth so Ibn Ezra adjusted the religion accordingly.</p>
<p>Rambam managed to make the Torah consistent with Greek and Arabic philosophy. Do we think that Rambam thought that Greek and Arabic philosophy were handed to Moses from God at Sinai? That&#8217;s preposterous. Rather, Rambam held that the maxims he accepted in those non-Jewish sources were the truth. If they are true, then the Torah must work with Greek and Arabic philosophy. Rambam made it work. It&#8217;s the same idea. Rambam accepted external evidence and then conformed the Torah to make sense in the context of his truth. Truth cannot be changed. But sometimes religious dogma can be changed. Even more surprising is that Rambam did not say &#8220;prove Greek and Arabic philosophy to me and then I will work out the Torah but until then I accept the Torah as truth and all this secular stuff is obviously wrong.&#8221; He simply accepted the secular wisdom as true and conformed Torah to that truth.</p>
<p>This is how the rishonim and Chazal dealt with Torah vs. evidence.</p>
<p>Similarly, when both Chazal and rishonim encountered a verse or section that seemed too unlikely to be literal, they interpreted it metaphorically. We don&#8217;t circumcise our hearts because that verse was deemed allegorical. Rishonim, like Ralbag and Rambam went even further by turning sections that contradicted their common sense into dream-sequences or metaphors. Many rishonim and even some achronim have done the same thing with difficult passages in the Talmud. If it can&#8217;t be explained literally because of evidence then it could be allegorized. (Granted, some achronim felt no pangs of guilt by simply saying that Chazal were incorrect.)</p>
<p>The point to all this is to demonstrate how things have changed. The achronim lived in a time where science and other evidence was used to counter religion, not bolster it. In turn, they began the trend of lifting religion above the fray and arguing that the science or other evidence must be reinterpreted to fit religion. If it could not reinterpreted, it was wrong. This is the paradigm of almost all religions since the Renaissance and Enlightenment. There were exceptions to this rule, but for the most part this rule has held firm for several hundred years. Evolution doesn&#8217;t seem to fit in with Biblical narratives? Despite much more evidence than there is for the erroneous astronomy Rambam used in the Mishneh Torah, religious people all over the world are fighting against evolution. The Bible seems to be a composite work? Religious people reply that it&#8217;s impossible. Chazal seemed to be mistaken about medicine or science or math? Our modern thinking must be wrong, or alternatively the Talmud meant something else, or alternatively nature has changed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s such a different attitude from the way Torah scholars approached evidence for almost 2000 years.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t learn Chumash the same way the rishonim learned Chumash. Instead we learn what the rishonim said about the Chumash. This handicaps us from being too innovative on the one hand and has a way of maintaining tradition on the other hand.</p>
<p>I believe, what R&#8217; Farber is trying to do is to relaunch the ancient way of studying Chumash. How would Chazal or some of the rishonim reacted to the evidence presented by Biblical Criticism? If they were consistent, I believe they would have done something like R&#8217; Farber has done in his long article. I am not commenting on R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s academically leaning conclusions. There are other conclusions that could be reached by the questions raised. But his version is certainly a valid conclusion, especially when one only takes the academic data and for the sake of argument ignores the religious approach.</p>
<p>In his long article R&#8217; Farber allegorizes some things. Other things are seen as products of editing over time. We have seen that allegorization is an acceptable form of interpretation. We have also seen that it was obvious that to Chazal and rishonim that the text of the Torah had been edited. R&#8217; Gordimer and others take issue with both of these devices.</p>
<p>Allegorizing too much of the text could create a problem for people. It might be seen as cannibalizing the Torah. If the narratives are not literal then are they meaningful? R&#8217; Farber says yes. Others seem to say no. I don&#8217;t see a reason to say no. I only see a fear of what might happen if we say no. R&#8217; Farber is trying to lay the groundwork for allegorization not to be a problem.</p>
<p>As to the issue of subsequent editing of the Torah I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s a huge problem. R&#8217; Farber is not saying that random people came around and edited the Torah. I think R&#8217; Farber is saying that the edits were made by prophets. The same way we take the works of the prophets seriously and we take them as divine books, we can take edits to the Bible. Our Tanach is filled with various voices that sound very different. Sometimes these books contradict one another. But it&#8217;s okay because we know that they all came from God and God speaks through each prophet in a different way. If prophets did the same thing to the Torah, it&#8217;s true that this would be a very different way of looking at Torah, but in the end, it&#8217;s just as binding on us. It&#8217;s equally the word of God. <a href="http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6372&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=90" target="_blank">There is a rishon</a> who says something like this with regard to the stories in the Torah.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s approach completely changes what we mean by Torah M&#8217;Sinai as well. But is the belief in our version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai a necessary belief for orthodox Judaism to work? Perhaps not.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s worldview is the articulation of how Revelation and Torah M&#8217;Sinai works. Professor Tamar Ross makes an attempt at this, and I don&#8217;t think it satisfactory (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/12/torah-msinai-according-to-professor-tamar-ross/">Torah M’Sinai According to Professor Tamar Ross</a> ) R&#8217; Farber articulates his beliefs at the end of the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe in Torah Min Ha-Shamayim, that the Torah is from heaven, and that the entirety of the book is nevua (prophecy) and represents the encounter between God and the people of Israel.</li>
<li>I believe in Torah mi-Sinai, meaning the uniqueness of the Torah as being of a higher order than any other work in its level of divine encounter. The story of the revelation at Sinai in the Torah I understand as a narrative depiction of a deeper truth—the Torah is God’s book and the divine blueprint for Israel and Jewish life.</li>
<li>I believe that the Torah is meant to be as it is today and that all of its verses, from “Timnah was a concubine” (Gen. 36:12) to “I am the Lord your God,” are holy.</li>
<li>I believe that halakha and Jewish theology must develop organically from Torah interpretation and not by excising or ignoring any part of the Torah or Chazal’s interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p>They sound pretty safe and pretty reasonable. But I also think that this kind of Torah M&#8217;Sinai is too nuanced to catch on and it sounds too heretical to gain traction.</p>
<p>It seems to me that R&#8217; Farber is trying to use orthodox principles to push orthodox Judaism into a discussion about our sacred texts.</p>
<p>If this is what R&#8217; Farber is doing, and I am pretty sure it is, we can say that he has good intentions. We can also say that it deserves a conversation and not to be shot down as heretical immediately. I was particularly upset that the article on Cross-Currents did not articulate the objections to R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s statements. Instead quotes were mined and the audience was expected to simply conclude that the statements were heretical. It is symptomatic of a larger problem in orthodox Judaism where reason and debate are stifled. Dogmatic proclamations are very much in style. Well argued responsa died with R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein.</p>
<p>Purely for the sake of honest religious debate, I think that R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s approach demands a discussion and not condemnation. But for the social reasons I think there is even more benefit to an inclusive approach. We should not be rooting for a breakaway from orthodoxy by the Left, nor should we even give the appearance of rooting for it. One thing that Yeshiva Chovevei Torah and its community do well, is inclusivity. The times we live in are dark in some ways, but people are more capable than ever before to think on their own and formulate their judgments. I see no benefit to jettisoning an entire group of people and the people who are sympathetic to them because of controversial statements. I am aware that this is a time-honored custom of Jews and religious people everywhere. I just don&#8217;t see the utility in it anymore. Our best defense against losing the battle vs. complete secularism is not insularity and narrowing the playing field. Our best defense is the exact opposite.</p>
<p>If we want to have a small narrow-minded cult that ignores the outside world and in turn is ignored by the outisde world we should continue the trend of ousting people and movements from orthodox Judaism. If we want to keep a foothold in the outside world and carry weight and influence in a world that could certainly use some of our wisdom, we need to keep the broadest base possible.</p>
<p>I hope that R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s article and the entire theTorah.com website can become a springboard for education and discussion. Inclusivity to the maximum should be our goal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Cross-posted at <a href="https://medium.com/p/384410654ced" target="_blank">Medium</a></em></p>
<p>In the old days, when it was still cool to be a racist, people felt superior to other people because of the color of their skin. A white person was automatically better, smarter, more worthy than a non-white person and the average white person thought this was acceptable. This resulted in slavery, segregation, vigilante justice, and the dehumanization of black people.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have progressed as a society to the point where that kind of thinking is abhorrent and is considered wrong. That’s the good news.</p>
<p>However, we have also spawned a new form of racism. This is a much more subtle racism but equally nefarious.<span id="more-7398"></span></p>
<p>In the wake of the George Zimmerman trial we have seen strong reactions from some members of the black community decrying the lack of justice for Trayvon Martin. There is an equally strong counter-reaction explaining that it’s okay to suspect black people of crimes because the statistics support suspicion. This latter group are the modern racists.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7399" alt="6122894190_64c17ede01_b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6122894190_64c17ede01_b-600x488.jpg" />The statistics show that black people commit a higher proportion of crimes than white people. Leaving aside the difficulties presented by the bias of selective enforcement and selective prosecution, I argue that using these statistics at all is an example of modern racism.A statistic is only meaningful if the data being used is a factor in the conclusion. For example, (and this is completely fictional) if I were to show that the majority of red haired women possesed below average intelligence, that statistic would not be meaningful unless I showed a causation between hair color and inferior intelligence. If I can’t show that, the statistic is meaningless. Even if the statistic is “true” it still doesn’t tell me anything about other red haired women. It just means that red haired people are not a significant group with enough specific traits to be classsified as a group with particular characteristics and predictable tendencies.</p>
<p>Categorizing all black people as one large group where the acts of one black person in Florida somehow tell us something about a different black person in Seattle is racist. Even within the same community it can be offensive to group people together because they share a skin tone. If the only thing two people share is skin tone then we cannot make any meaningful inferences from one person’s behavior to the other person’s behavior.</p>
<p>If we make judgments for the entire arbitrarily created group, we are being racists. There is no reason that the act of a black man in Texas should mean more about the potential acts of a black man in Michigan than his acts should inform us about a a white Norwegian woman or an indigenous Korean man. The only reason to connect the imaginary dots between all people of color is because there is a fallacious assumption that all people of color share some attribute that makes what one black person does meaningful in the analysis of what another will do. This is racist.</p>
<p>It’s not racist in the old fashioned lynch mob way. But it is still racist to presume one knows things about one black person simply because another black person or group of black people act a certain way.</p>
<p>I find that this is a very difficult concept for some people. These people clearly think that there actually is a black predisposition toward illegal or dangerous activity.</p>
<p>We must not tolerate that kind of thinking in 2013.</p>
<p>I’m looking at you <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/black-americas-real-problem-isnt-white-racism-070000529.html" target="_blank">Pat Buchanan</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a great article in the NY Times last week about nostalgia. I believe that nostalgia is a very important element of the religious experience. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/03/21/the-magical-secret-of-the-seder/">The Magical Secret of the Seder</a>)</p>
<p>I had no idea that until recently nostalgia was considered a mental disorder. Apparently, it was thought to be akin to depression. But people who were nostalgic were not sad and so research commenced to determine the proper classification and function of nostalgia.</p>
<p>It turns out that nostalgia is actually pretty useful. Studies have shown that nostalgia can make people feel happier, can physically warm the body, can give people hope, and overall improve one&#8217;s life. This all serves very important evolutionary purposes. Modernly, it helps with relationships in general and in particular with marriage. Good memories make for good relationships.<span id="more-7393"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7394" alt="V7K1cJRPaafgLZP" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/V7K1cJRPaafgLZP-600x450.jpg" /></p>
<p>Looking at nostalgia through the lens of the religious person, nostalgia becomes even more useful. If our religion gives us good memories and makes us feel good when we are young it is going to be important to us to relive those memories year to year and life event to life event. Even more importantly, it motivates us to give our children similar experiences. We want our children to look fondly upon their youth and we want religion to be front and center in their positive memories.</p>
<p>I think we should cultivate good memories. We should create our own nostalgia. We should actively mine those memories for good feelings towards people, family, spouses, and of course religion. Jewish holidays are perfect for this kind of work but really it should be a full time effort.</p>
<p>All this leads me to two issues that are plaguing the orthodox Jewish community right now.</p>
<p>Victims of sex abuse invoke many coping mechanisms to deal with the betrayal and violence of the crimes perpetrated against them. Obviously, if the abuser is an authority or religious figure, the victim&#8217;s associations with religion become supremely negative. There is little religious nostalgia for victims. Even worse, is when the coping mechanism involves repressing memories of one&#8217;s childhood. Some victims cannot even remember their childhood. Clearly, these victims have no nostalgia towards their religion. They may stay in the fold for other reasons, but an important part of their religious experience is left with a gaping hole instead of positive memories. Aside from robbing children of their innocence and inflicting untold pain of their victims, predators paint over their victim&#8217;s childhood memories with a very big, very dark brush. This has many negative consequences, including religious consequences.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have witnessed there is a recent spate of <i>baalei teshuva </i>returning to their prior lives and leaving orthodox Judaism. This group also lacks the nostalgia of an orthodox Jewish upbringing. This is not a defect. It can be a difference that does not make a distinction. But for some people, it can be hard to stay in the orthodox Jewish community and for some of those people nostalgia is a decent motivating factor. Unfortunately, those who choose to become orthodox later in life lack this secret weapon. Sometimes that can make all the difference in the world between staying or leaving.</p>
<p>The article in the NY Times corroborates what I think is a very underappreciated part of being an orthodox Jew. Nostalgia. Those who are missing it, whether because of despicable violence or courage to choose orthodox Judaism are often missing this non-essential ingredient. But we all have the power to give it to our children and I contend that it&#8217;s a very worthwhile endeavor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rabbi Louis Jacobs was an orthodox rabbi in the early 20th century. He was orthodox until he wasn&#8217;t. Professor Alan Brill chronicles the demise of Jacobs and how he diverged from prior orthodox positions and adopted liberal positions that were reserved for the non-orthodox.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate for orthodox Judaism that Jacobs and his contributions were lost to orthodox Judaism. I think we would be better off today had Jacobs toed the line and stayed within the bounds of orthodoxy. He was a great thinker and we nearly had the benefit of his thinking in orthodox Judaism.<span id="more-7368"></span></p>
<p>In short, Jacobs accepted elements of Biblical Criticism to the extent that his view could not be reconciled with any version of orthodox Judaism. According to Brill, Jacobs believed that much of the text of the Bible was not dictated to Moses. He believed that the origins of Judaism were not relevant rather the evolved Judaism of the 20th century was key. Eventually he went so far as to say that the Bible was written by humans.<img class="size-full wp-image-7369 alignright" alt="09jacobs_190" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/09jacobs_190.jpg" width="190" height="257" /></p>
<p>This placed him firmly outside the camp of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>But the real tragedy is what Brill says at the end of his post. Before Jacobs, orthodox Judaism had been developing an acceptable version of dealing with Biblical Criticism. Rabbis like Rabbi J.H. Hertz and Rabbi Isidore Epstein had previously acknowledged that while there was a revelation at Sinai, some parts of the Torah either predated Sinai and were including by incorporation or that some edits may have been made after Sinai. Their  views allowed some human element to the Bible.</p>
<p>The view of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein are significant. Both were orthodox rabbis and nevertheless were able to assert that there was a human element to the Bible.</p>
<p>However, Brill asserts that after Jacobs was ousted from orthodox Judaism for his newfound heretical views, the previously acceptable opinions of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein were given the pink slip as well. The approach to Biblical Criticism that developed in the wake of the Jacobs fiasco was so rigid that the somewhat flexible views of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein were no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>I think this is unfortunate. Orthodox Jews are expected to believe in the most rigid form of Torah M&#8217;Sinai. It is more rigid that the accepted beliefs of great orthodox rabbis from all across the timeline of Jewish history. Is it all because of Jacobs? Maybe. It certainly fits historically.</p>
<p>So while it is a shame that we lost Jacobs, in essence we have also lost Rabbis Hertz and Epstein. This is an even greater tragedy. They were orthodox and now their views are widely considered unorthodox.</p>
<p>But would it not be helpful to 2013 Judaism to allow their opinions back into the fold? I think it would. Absolute Torah M&#8217;Sinai can be a greater challenge than believing in God or in the power of Chazal to create obligation to contemporary orthodox Jews. Perhaps having a more flexible version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai that is consistent with historical orthodox Judaism would be of great use to frum skeptics everywhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was invited to join Rabbi Shafran to talk about recent comments by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks and the subsequent response by the Agudah. We discussed it on Facebook on Friday and I guess Zev or one of his producers saw the comment thread and decided to ask me onto the show. The format of the show was to be a moderated discussion between Rabbi Shafran and me.<span id="more-7357"></span></p>
<p>Rabbi Shafran represented the Agudah position. I represented the non-Agudah position.<img class="size-medium wp-image-7358 alignright" alt="old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The gist of Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s argument was that Rabbi Sacks was criticizing a legitimate form of orthodox Judaism and was doing so from a place of ignorance as evidenced by his mention of the Siyum HaShas as an example of inward turning segregationism. Thus, the Agudah was standing up for themselves and the more insular communities who were criticized.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the Agudah over reacted. Rabbi Sacks was not even criticizing the insular communities as much as he was warning of a potential danger if the trend to the right continues. In his view, and in mine, there is a lot of value in a version of Judaism that sympathizes with orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Judaism should be careful not to eliminate this soft center between non-orthodox Judaism and orthodox Judaism. While the choice of the Siyum HaShas was unfortunate, I don&#8217;t think it accurately reflected his sentiments.</p>
<p>Regardless of what Rabbi Sacks meant, this is an important discussion and I invited Rabbi Shafran and the radio audience to have that discussion. While it is entertaining to argue about what Rabbi Sacks was trying to say, it is far less important than the substance his point.</p>
<p>Listen to the show below. I&#8217;ve cut the 2 hour show into 1:20 of just talking. So no ads or news will disturb your listening. The quality of the recording is pretty brutal but this was what I received from the producer.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meditation was once an oddity reserved for spiritual extremists. Today, meditation is as American as apple pie.</p>
<p>There are many good reasons to do meditation. The NY Times enumerates several of the benefits that have been demonstrated by science. Improved leadership and productivity can be attributed to meditation.</p>
<p>Meditation has a place in Judaism as well. Many great Jewish thinkers have described Jewish prayer as a form of meditation. The prophets of yore achieved their heightened spiritual state after intense meditation. There are pious chasidic men (and maybe some women) who meditate alone in the Jerusalem Forest on a regular basis. For us, meditation is a word to describe an activity whose end is to achieve some state of nirvana. It could even be argued that making blessings before eating food or enjoying any other physical pleasure is a variation of mindfulness.<span id="more-7348"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7349 alignright" alt="meditation-6" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/meditation-6-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The NY Times reports that there is a reason that Buddha favored meditation. Buddha&#8217;s teachings were to end suffering. Meditation was intended to serve as a way of freeing one&#8217;s mind of the negative thoughts we have about others. The idea was to bring people together through the heightened state of awareness.</p>
<p>This is a lofty claim and it was put to the test by the author of the NY Times article, profesor of psychology Dr. David DeSteno. He and his lab conducted controlled experiments to determine if meditation had an impact on empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>The results? Incredibly, or maybe not, meditation actually helped a significant portion of test subjects feel empathetic. It works!</p>
<p>DeSteno concludes that while the fringe benefits are great, when one meditates one should be mindful of its original purpose. Hopefully if we can channel that power we can alleviate the pain of division and hate.</p>
<p>I can think of no message more appropriate for Rosh Chodesh Av. This time of year we are exhorted to work on our interpersonal skills. Perhaps it would be wise to spend some time in meditation to give ourselves an assist on this seasonal challenge.</p>
<p>The article also got me thinking about doing Mitzvos to reap the social benefits of the act or even to reap an alternative benefit that was certainly unintended. Sometimes people lament the new-agey interpretations of Mitzvos and modern understandings of their social benefits. True, it can feel uncomfortable, but I think it&#8217;s noteworthy that we find similar hand wringing with regard to meditation. DeSteno is a bit uncomfortable with using meditation to get ahead instead of using it to unite. I think we can relate to that.</p>
<p>Finally, one can imagine how vindicated followers of Buddha must feel. As orthodox Jews, we feel the same way some our traditions and teachings are corroborated by modern discoveries. I know I love when that happens, so I am sure the study mentioned in this article will bring similar feelings of euphoria to students of Buddha.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7319" alt="images" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images.jpeg" width="275" height="183" /></a>The USA Today reports that there are some orthodox Jews who will watch fireworks tonight with no sound. Seeing as this year the 4th of July is during the 3 Weeks between Shiva Asar B&#8217;Tamuz and Tisha B&#8217;Av there are some elements of mourning that are customary during this period. Many orthodox Jews refrain from listening to music as part of their mourning these 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Fireworks are often accompanied by music. Journalist Menachem Wecker was curious if the music accompaniment would cause some orthodox Jews to forgo the usual fireworks celebrations.</p>
<p>There are probably very few orthodox Jews who care about July 4th who also would be so stringent about the 3 weeks that they would not even listen to background music. Of those who are that stringent, very few would care to participate in July 4th festivities.<span id="more-7318"></span></p>
<p>Are there any orthodox Jews who will avoid places that have music in the background? What do they do if they get put on hold? Radio advertisement jingles? Cell phone ring tones? Singing toddler toys? That <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQT9K_nkeVQ" target="_blank">awesome music that plays when you start Windows 2000</a>? Obviously these questions are absurd. The real prohibition is against live music and celebration. Most orthodox Jews extend that to recored music as well. But I don&#8217;t think there are many people who avoid music at all costs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I told Menachem Wecker when he talked with me about this issue and then I was quoted in his article.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the headline though. It kind of says the opposite of what the article says.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, if a July 4th celebration would interfere with one&#8217;s observance of the appropriate level of mourning at this time of year, I think one should make their own decision to refrain from celebrating. I don&#8217;t that would apply to many people, but out first allegiance is to Torah, then and only then do we pledge allegiance to the flag.</p>
<p>Enjoy the holiday. Happy birthday America!</p>

The topic was this: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/30/great-idea-terrible-execution/">Great Idea, Terrible Execution</a>.</p>
<p>My shul is in a place that might be more diverse than anywhere else in the world. My worldview is the complete opposite from the worldview of insular chasidic Jews in Monsey. So perhaps the idea was to use my experience in Venice to brainstorm ways to nudge the insular community towards a bit more tolerance and integration.</p>
<p>We were joined by Reverend Weldon McWilliams IV who has become the face of the Wake Up Rockland activist group. He is a wonderful fellow and I enjoyed our time together.</p>
<p>It was an interesting conversation and does dovetail into a passion of mine. Helping people and communities understand one another is very important to me and I hope that our conversation today can be the start of a journey toward more unity in Monsey.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MATZOH-articleLarge.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7292" alt="MATZOH-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MATZOH-articleLarge-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>The NY Times must be learning Daf Yomi. Just when we all started learning about the laws of chametz and matzah, the Times runs a front page above the fold story on Satmar A (as opposed to Satmar Z) protocols for matzah baking. It seems that Satmar A, and maybe others I really don&#8217;t know, are not satisfied with the &#8220;<em>shmura m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; and add an extra layer of stringency. They are careful to use wheat that did not even become wet while it was growing. They grow wheat on a far flung farm in Arizona where there is no rain for months while the wheat grows.</p>
<p>Why do they do this?</p>
<p>Halacha requires that we use &#8220;Shmurah Matzah&#8221; at the Seder (and some authorities say all Pesach). Shmura Matzah is not synonymous with round, dark matzah. Matzah can be Shmurah and any shape. Shmurah means that the ingredients for the Matzah were watched to ensure that the grains did not become leaven by coming in contact with water and not being baked within 18 minutes. There are three opinions in halacha as to when the ingredients for matzah must be &#8220;watched&#8221; in order to qualify for &#8220;Shmurah Matzah.&#8221; The most &#8220;watched&#8221; that halacha requires in that the wheat be watched from the time of harvesting. That is why most Matzah says &#8220;<em>Shmurah m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; &#8211; watched from the time of reaping.</p>
<p>There are no opinions in halacha that require that the grains not come in contact with water before they are reaped. None that I could find at least.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on here?<span id="more-7290"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times tells us exactly what is going on here. Here is what Professor Samuel Heilman has to say:</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;the competition between the two Satmar groups — each led by one of two brothers — was about one-upmanship.</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“One is always looking to be more authoritative than the other,” Professor Heilman said, “and one of the ways they’re making this happen is over matzo — our matzo is more kosher than yours, we’re more scrupulous and careful over matzo baking than you are.”</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">One-upmanship in halacha. Nailed it. When so many of us are mitzvah observant we need to do things to signal to others that we are different. We are better. That signal is the extra level of stringency that is completely unnecessary. For more on this social phenomenon check this out: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/19/suggestion-read-judaism-as-a-first-language-right-now/">Judaism as a First Language</a></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">But I think there is something more happening here. While it is true that there may be nothing wrong with being extra stringent, this kind of stringency borders on silliness. The concern that created the requirement to use Shmurah Matzah is that the wheat will actually become chametz. If water comes in contact with flour while it is in storage the wheat can become chametz. That&#8217;s science. But it is literally impossible for grains that are still growing to become Chametz. Impossible. In much the same way that it is impossible for cooked matzah to become chametz if it comes in contact with liquid. Yet, there are thousands of Jews who don&#8217;t eat <em>gebrukst </em>because of that very concern.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Adding stringencies like <em>gebrukst</em> and growing wheat where there is no rain only makes sense in one context. If Judaism is a magical, mystical, mystery and our rational minds are useless to understand the laws of Judaism then it does not matter that there is no possibility of becoming chametz. All that matters is that water and wheat do not come in contact ever. Even if the prohibition is against chametz and not all wheat and water become chametz it does not matter. But if Judaism is a religion with Divine instructions that are supposed to be understood as rationally as possible and the rules tell us what our concerns are supposed to be, there is not place for non-sensical stringencies.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">When it comes to chametz, we are given specific instructions as to what the prohibition entails. The law requires us to be careful not to let the wheat and water ferment and begin to rise. It&#8217;s based on science. Anything that could help prevent that from happening is a reasonable stringency. But once we get into the kind of stringencies that will not prevent a violation of a prohibition, it is hard to see their value unless we say something magical is happening and that wheat and water may never touch. The thing is, that&#8217;s not what the Torah, Talmud, Shulchan Aruch, and responsa tell us. To them, it has nothing to do with science. It has everything to do mysticism.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Now I think I can understand why the NY Times found this so interesting. Growing wheat in Arizona so it doesn&#8217;t rain on the wheat? It&#8217;s irrational. It is religion without reason. It&#8217;s exotic, archaic, and mystical. It&#8217;s not the Judaism that so many of us practice. It&#8217;s a Judaism that almost purposely does not make rational sense and is purely mystical. That&#8217;s front page news.</p>

<p><em>Sorry about the mini blog-cation. I think I am back.</em></p>
<p>On Friday in downtown Monsey a newly formed group of activists called Wake Up Rockland entered Rockland Kosher Supermarket, basically it&#8217;s the Pomegranate of Monsey. The group was led by a black reverend and was made up of a cross-section of non-Jews from the local community. They marched into the store, innocent frum Jews looked on, mouths agape, as the activists walked up and down the aisles looking for items to purchase. The store did not appreciate this gesture and they asked that the group leave.</p>
<p>The group had summoned the media to be present at the demonstration and the local paper wrote about the effort. The article seems to praise the activists and is lukewarm on the store people who were not receptive to the group.</p>
<p>Demonstrators explained that they were hoping to show the frum community that we are neighbors, they are not going anywhere, and we should try to integrate our communities a bit or at the very least try to get along.</p>
<p>I think this is a great idea. There is tension in Ramapo. There are non-Jews who are nasty to Jews and there are Jews who are nasty to non-Jews. It would be great if the two communities could somehow come together.</p>
<p>But there are a couple problems with the execution of this idea.<span id="more-7286"></span></p>
<p>First, the demonstrators seem to think that there is segregation in Ramapo. It&#8217;s not really segregation. It&#8217;s more like insularity. The frum community in Monsey wants to be insular and free from secular influences. So it&#8217;s not bigotry per se. In other words, bridging the gap is not a solution, it&#8217;s actually looked at as a problem for the frum community.</p>
<p>But more importantly, if the activists are genuine, and I have no reason to think they are not, they should work together with liaisons from the frum community to create harmony. No one wants to be surprised or forced into unity. Popping into Rockland Kosher on Friday may have worked for the cameras and for headlines, but it will not achieve the desired result unless members of the frum community participate in the decision-making and execution of ideas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really not that different than the situation in Israel with the charedim. Both situations needs insiders to make the change happen. But more importantly, the very philosophy and way of life that the charedim in Israel and Monsey live makes it nearly impossible to foster integration with non-charedim.</p>
<p>This kind of worldview is becoming more and more archaic and anachronistic. The world is less tolerant of insularity and isolation. The world desires integration, mutual respect, and harmony. The challenge for charedim will be how this approach to a global community can be reconciled with insularity, if it can at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/israel-jerus-285.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7269" alt="israel-jerus-285" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/israel-jerus-285-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>In many ways Mormons are like American Orthodox Jews. We share many values and our lifestyles are very similar. One thing that we share is the emphasis on modesty. The rules of modesty in Mormonism are far less rigid than they are in orthodox Judaism, but they are taken just as seriously. Their rules sound like 20th century rules and ours sound like 16th century rules. All this makes perfect sense considering when our books of law were codified.</p>
<p>One thing Mormons do at the tender age of 19 is they go on Missions. We have <a href="http://chinuch.org/project_seed.php" target="_blank">Project SEED</a> programs. It&#8217;s basically the same idea.</p>
<p>For many young Mormons it is their first real contact with non-Mormons on a regular basis. Obviously this creates new challenges for the missionaries. It seems that dealing with the relative immodesty of non-Mormons when compared with what they are accustomed to is a particularly difficult challenge.</p>
<p>Mormons are expected to be chaste in every possible way and this can be particularly difficult for young men.</p>
<p>A young man on a Mission where clothing is worn sparingly writes of his personal struggles.<span id="more-7268"></span> It is fascinating to hear him talk in Mormon terms about struggles that he shares with young Yeshiva students. What is most interesting is where he takes the article. I recommend reading the article for its content but also to compare it with our values and terminology.</p>
<p>He wants things to change. In short, he uses anecdotal evidence, scientific studies, and logic to argue that the overemphasis on modesty has the opposite of its intended effect. Instead of making it easier for men it makes it harder for men. Further, it does not ensure that women are thought of in the purest of terms. Finally, it reinforces unfortunate stereotypes about pleasure and intimacy that can have negative consequences later on in life and throughout marriage.</p>
<p>He concludes that it is time to rethink old ideas about sexuality in the Mormon Church.</p>
<p>I sense that a similar conversation is brewing in the orthodox Jewish community. All the talk of Tznius is having an opposite of its desired effect on so many people in our community. It has gone from reasonable to extreme to laughable. Has it even helped anything? What are the tangible benefits of increased modesty to an absurd degree?</p>
<p>Science and soft science have a lot to say about how we are affected by what we see and what we wear. Are we interested in what they say? Is there a way to bridge the gap between the two?</p>
<p>Will a budding Torah scholar with Yeshiva bona fides write an article like this? Are we ready for this conversation?</p>
<p>These are tough questions but I think we will be doing a world of good by trying to answer them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/liar.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7257" alt="liar" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/liar-300x292.jpg" width="300" height="292" /></a>One of the primary concerns in the orthodox Jewish community when discussing the issue of reporting sex abuse to the authorities is that inevitably there will be false accusations that will ruin the lives of innocent people. It is very scary to think that someone can be named as an abuser and before any evidence is presented the accused can be found guilty in the court of public opinion. In a community where the main currency is reputation and communal standing false accusations can have drastic consequences.</p>
<p>This is a good reason not to judge people before the facts are known and also a good argument against placing too much stock in reputation. Changing our approach on these issues would go a long way to making our communities safer places.</p>
<p>Whether concern over false accusations is a legitimate reason to require rabbinic approval before going to the authorities is a discussion for another time. I don&#8217;t see why should be any different than other non-orthodox Jewish communities, but again, not the discussion here.</p>
<p>The NY Times has a very (appropriately) one-sided article on the Baruch Lebovits and Sam Kellner situation.<span id="more-7256"></span> In short, Lebovits is a known sex abuser, he molested Kellner&#8217;s son, Kellner got permission from a rabbinic court to pursue Lebovits in criminal proceedings, and Lebovits was convicted. Kellner was a hero and symbol of strength in the victims advocates community. Then Kellner was convicted of obstruction for allegedly offering money for testimony and threatening to extort Lebovitz&#8217;s family. Kellner was charged and to add insult to injury, Lebovits&#8217;s conviction was overturned. He awaits retrial.</p>
<p>The Times quotes a rabbi who advised Kellner to go to the authorities as saying that if Kellner goes to jail it will have the effect of preventing future victims from coming forward. It&#8217;s hard enough to come forward in the community but it will be even harder if a strong advocate for victims of abuse finds himself in trouble with the law.</p>
<p>The merits of Kellner&#8217;s case notwithstanding, I think it could be argued that a conviction of Kellner would have the opposite effect. If one concern with reporting abuse to the authorities is the fear of false accusations, it is possible that seeing Kellner&#8217;s troubles with the law could mitigate this fear. Clearly, the law does not take kindly to those who are deceptive or dishonest when reporting allegations of abuse. Thus it stands to reason that we need not be terribly concerned that false allegations would occur frequently.</p>
<p>The Brian Banks case illustrates this same idea. Banks was a rising college football star when he plead guilty to rape. The accuser admitted to lying after Banks sat in jail for several years. Banks was released and now his accuser is being sued for millions of dollars. She will probably lose too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that Banks was falsely accused and proponents of rabbinic go-betweens might point to the case to show how dangerous it can be to just go to the authorities without an independent investigation. However, the fact that the false accuser stands to lose millions of dollars in civil court, not to mention possible criminal prosecution actually serves as a huge deterrent. Certainly these kinds of consequences to false accusations will serve as a barrier to future false accusations.</p>
<p>The point is that false accusations happen from time to time. But when they do happen there are severe consequences. It&#8217;s unlikely that people would be willing to risk suffering those severe consequences when there is no basis for their accusation. We should not be afraid that these stories will chill allegations of abuse in our community. We should use these stories as examples of the fidelity of the criminal justice system and hopefully our community will encourage victims of abuse to come forward without being overly concerned with false accusations so that we can get to fixing this problem as quickly as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/P3080110.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7250" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/P3080110-300x240.jpg" width="300" height="240" /></a>The war over MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is rising to a crescendo. The mouthpiece of the Ultra-Orthodox American establishment is the Yated Ne&#8217;eman. The Yated and its Matzav.com website are <a href="http://www.yated.com/dov-lipman--bad-choice-to-keynote-rca-convention.7-977-7-.html" target="_blank">leading the charge to discredit and demonize Lipman</a> in every way possible. Meanwhile, the Centrist Orthodox Americans are watching from the sidelines as they watch a potential hero go to zero. The Modern Orthodox Jewish community is becoming enraged as they see their values trudged upon by their charedi brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mess.</p>
<p>Two important voices from the moderate camp have invited Lipman to speak. The RCA Convention will be headlined by Lipman and the BAYT Shul in Toronto is featuring Lipman as a Scholar in Residence the last week in June.</p>
<p>For these grievous sins, Lipman, the RCA, and BAYT have come under a severe assault of attacks from the Yated and Matzav. Articles calling for boycotts of these fine institutions, articles condemning the the decision makers and rabbinic leadership of both institutions, and of course articles enumerating the horrible sins of Lipman as ammunition for their war appear regularly in their pages.<span id="more-7249"></span></p>
<p>The thrust of their arguments against Lipman focus on isolated incidents, out of context quotes, but most of all guilt by association.</p>
<p>I think this is a very important point. There are pundits who &#8220;connect the dots&#8221; to spin conspiracy tales on a daily basis. People believe it. Others just disqualify the opinions or ideas of others because they have a second cousin who gave money to someone else who has a nephew in Al Qaeda. People seem to be okay with this too. For some, guilt by association is actual guilt. For these people, who you know and with whom you associate determine your credibility.</p>
<p>Obviously, this parlor game is ridiculous. If you search long enough you can connect any two people in the world. Guilt by association is terrible way to make a point. Assuming that the two people are associated, there is no evidence that they agree on anything. They could hate each other. Or they could agree on one thing and completely disagree on another. It&#8217;s pure scare tactics and dishonesty to impugn people because of loose ties or even strong ties that they may have with others who might be different or even dangerous.</p>
<p>The same exact thing is happening now in the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish media.</p>
<p>Lipman is in the same party as Yair Lapid? And Lapid&#8217;s father, Tommy, was virulently anti-orthodox? Lipman must also be anti-orthodox! The RCA asked Lipman to speak? The RCA must agree with everything Yair Lapid says too! BAYT invited Lipman for Shabbos? BAYT is clearly anti-Torah.</p>
<p>These are the arguments being made.</p>
<p>The non-Ultra-Orthodox Jews don&#8217;t play this game. They would prefer to hear challenging ideas and thought provoking conversation than disqualify any dissenters by way of guilt by association. Does the RCA agree with every single thing Lipman says? Probably not. No two people agree on everything! Does BAYT co-sign every single thing Lipman has ever done? Of course not. But both institutions pride themselves on appealing to a broad spectrum of orthodox Jews and care passionately about matters of great communal importance. Thus, Lipman is a great candidate for a talk in both places.</p>
<p>But the uber-charedi world it doesn&#8217;t work like that. Unless someone is 100% kosher, they can&#8217;t get to the table. No matter how salient their points may be, they don&#8217;t have the opportunity to be heard. Worse, when two people are associated, and person A says or does something controversial, everyone runs to person B and asks if person B &#8220;holds of&#8221; what person A did. It&#8217;s ridiculous! People can disagree. People can have different opinions. Why is it even expected that if person B associates with person A they would agree with everything person A does? It makes no sense.</p>
<p>This is the best way to seek and destroy any dissent or debate. There is no room for dissent or debate when as soon as someone dissents or debates all that person&#8217;s associates are impugned and they are forced to distance themselves from the dissenter or debater. Nothing could be more chilling.</p>
<p>The other way is to analyze ideas, not people. Rambam writes &#8220;Hear truth from whoever says it.&#8221; These are wise words. The source of an idea is only secondary to the content of the idea. Great people can say stupid things and stupid people can say great things. It&#8217;s terribly insecure and unwise to automatically eliminate so many voices simply because they are guilty by association.</p>
<p>I believe that this is the primary issue that is at play here. Since Lipman is straddling two worlds, he is by definition persona non grata in the Ultra-Orthodox world. One can&#8217;t be for Torah and also cavort with people who are not for Torah. Therefore he is automatically wrong and all the rules of fair play and honesty are no longer relevant. He is a threat who must be stopped. He is not a voice that must be answered. This is the only explanation for the completely disingenuous and false attacks against Lipman.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old argument within orthodox Judaism. For some time now there has been resistance against fostering debate and conversation amongst people with differing views and perspectives. Worse, it has long been established that orthodox Rabbis may not sit on organizations with non-orthodox Jews lest it be perceived as endorsement of non-orthodox values. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a great tactic, nor do I think it&#8217;s wise in the long run. Writing for Tradition Magazine, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/23256285" target="_blank">Rabbi Shubert Spero addressed this issue in 1966</a> and we can see how things have changed since then. Rabbi Spero was writing about engaging non-orthodox Jews. Engaging orthodox Jews wasn&#8217;t an issue in 1966.</p>
<p>Look where we are today. We still don&#8217;t participate with non-orthodox Jews. In fact the <a href="http://matzav.com/the-rca-and-the-women-of-the-wall" target="_blank">Yated recently addressed this very issue</a>, going so far as to compare Reform Jews in the mid-20th century with the Women of the Wall and MK Lipman. The Yated takes for granted that it would be prohibited to work together with Reform Jews, the additional point was that this rule would also apply to WoW and Lipman. In 1966 Rabbi Spero was hopeful that orthodox Jews could participate with non-orthodox Jews. Here we stand in 2013 and orthodox Jews cannot participate with orthodox Jews who associate with non-orthodox Jews! It seems to me we are going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>What will it take to change the tenor of discourse in the orthodox Jewish community? I don&#8217;t know. Maybe an Asifa. An <em>achdus</em> Asifa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/life-preserver.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7244" alt="life-preserver" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/life-preserver-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>I don’t think it matters much what Jewish law would say about the government snooping on its citizens. The government is not subject to Jewish law and its citizens don’t expect the government to conform its policies to Jewish law. Yet, there seems to be value in such analysis as I have been asked this question by several people.</p>
<p>As is often the case, we have two competing interests at stake. Privacy on one hand and safety on the other. Both of these interests are recognized in Jewish law. But they are completely different planes.</p>
<p>Life is primary in Jewish law. All else comes after life. One is not permitted to kill. One is not permitted to commit suicide. One is not permitted to harm one self. One is not permitted to place one’s life in danger. One is obligated to violate Jewish law in order to save one’s own life (with three exceptions &#8211; murder, idolatry, and adultery). The sanctity of life is of the utmost importance in Jewish law. These particular laws are derived from primary sources in the Torah and Mishna.<span id="more-7243"></span></p>
<p>There is also a prohibition against snooping on one’s neighbor in Jewish law. One is not permitted to place a window overlooking one’s neighbor’s private property. This sort of loss of privacy gives rise to a civil action in Jewish court. Some authorties extend right of privacy to include eavesdropping or even accidentally hearing others in private conversation.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is standing prohibtion in Jewish law against sharing anything revealed in private conversation. Without specifically stating that a conversation is allowed to be shared, it is required to be kept in confidence.</p>
<p>Finally, much later on in Jewish legal history a ban was placed on reading the private communications of others. This decree originally applied to mail but many authorities now extend it to all forms of communication.</p>
<p>These considerations all apply today and would apply to governments as well.</p>
<p>However, none of these considerations overrides the sanctity of life. If just one life could be saved it seems that all these rules could be ignored. Certainly, it would be expected that the minimal intrusion to save the life would be made. Saving a life is not a license to do as one pleases. Further, use of the information gathered would be limited to the purpose of saving lives and nothing else.The interesting thing here is that one life is enough for all our privacy to be suspended. One life is all it takes.</p>
<p>It would seem that as long as lives are being saved, the government is not bound by the strict privacy laws or decrees. The question then becomes whether lives are actually being saved. I don’t know the answer to that question. But that is the issue. It is the only issue.If there is a threat of loss of life, the government or any private citizen would have the right and according to some authorities the obligation to spy on its citizens to protect others.</p>
<p>I think it is laudible that the government takes the lives of its citizens so seriously. Obviously there are concerns that the government will use the information obtained improperly. However, there can be no prohibition against the gathering of the information so long as lives are at stake.</p>

To be honest, when I read the interview I was unable to comprehend what she was trying to say. Only after a lengthy Facebook conversation and some posts by Gideon Slifkin did I get her approach, sort of.</p>
<p>Her words are very dense and quite cryptic but I think this what she is trying to say.</p>
<p>In her opinion, we have two immovable objects. We have Divine Revelation and the requisite belief that God gave the Torah to us in its complete form and we have Biblical Criticism which in her opinion asserts that the Torah has evolved from multiple authors and multiple eras. Something has to give. For most people, ignorance about one or the other is the turning point. People who know more about Biblical Criticism than TMS are more likely to think that the Torah is not Divine. Those who know more about (the Orthodox Jewish) approach to Torah than Biblical Criticism are more likely to think that Biblical Criticism is just a theory or soft science with more biases than religious approaches to Torah.</p>
<p>I am not here to take sides and apparently neither is Professor Ross.<span id="more-7233"></span></p>
<p>Ross&#8217;s basic idea is that &#8220;revelation&#8221; was not a one time thing. The revelation continues as the world progressed and however the Torah was emended or edited after Sinai was part of revelation. In order to make this sound religious, Professor Ross uses all kinds of fancy kabbalistic &#8220;logic&#8221; to make this approach kosher. In short, God is not bound by time so everything is really happening at once. Revelation can&#8217;t be just a moment in time and God is continually revealed through the evolution of Torah. Apparently there are allusions to this kind of theology in classical sources. Also, the thing that make our tradition unique is only that it is our tradition. I&#8217;m not sure how and why this fits in, but she does say it.</p>
<p>Read the entire interview because the bulk of it is really about what this approach is not as opposed to what this approach actually is. But what is it?</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not Orthodox. That&#8217;s for sure. But as has been pointed out, it&#8217;s not that far off. In terms of how the charedi world sees Mesorah and Daas Torah, the assumption is that God is &#8220;signing off&#8221; on the developments of Orthodox Judaism is part and parcel of how charedi Judaism works. So is it so hard to hear that God functioned the same way with regard to how the text of the Written Law evolved? Granted, the Written Law and Oral Law have different parameters and roles and I am not saying that these two ideas are the same. I am merely pointing out that the two ideas are similar.</p>
<p>Is this idea viable or useful?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. First of all, simple ideas are popular. There is a reason that more nuanced positions are less popular than bombastic theories of everything. People like when things are simple. The fundamentalist version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai is simple and not nuanced at all. It&#8217;s also pretty popular. If you want a theory to be popular it needs to be simple. Professor Ross has proposed a very complicated theory that is very difficult to articulate. It&#8217;s not going to gain much traction because of this fatal flaw.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think that an idea like this is not likely to help actual people. People who believe in the fundamentalist version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai don&#8217;t need this. People who reject Torah M&#8217;Sinai are not usually looking for creative way to believe in Torah M&#8217;Sinai. Further, I am not sure that this path will lead people who reject fundamentalist Torah M&#8217;Sinai to mitzvah observance. I think they want to do what God says to do, not what men say to do as a part of God&#8217;s slow revelation.</p>
<p>However, there are a few people in the middle who I am confident that this approach can help. Some people just want some theological basis to be orthodox and this can potentially serve that small group. If we believe in the primacy of keeping Torah and Mitzvos then we should welcome creative ways that are somewhat theologically sound to help more people accomplish this goal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/noah.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7229" alt="noah" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/noah-300x163.jpg" width="300" height="163" /></a>One of the more difficult stories in the Bible is the story of Noah and the Flood. It is confounding on several fronts.</p>
<p>The morality of the tale challenges us. The text of the narrative is confusing. The presence of competing flood narratives from the rest of the ancient world gives us pause. The paucity of scientific and archaeological evidence of a massive flood is disconcerting. Perhaps most of all, it is difficult for our modern ears to hear the relevance of the story today.</p>
<p>All the aforementioned issues can be answered with a variety of approaches. We have dealt with some of the them on this blog. (See here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/10/17/a-possible-bombshell-from-rabbi-j-h-hertz-on-the-great-flood-in-parshas-noach/" target="_blank">Flood Bombshell</a>)</p>
<p>On Tablet Magazine <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/author/mingall/">Marjorie Ingall</a> reviews a new book with a version of the flood story told as if it were an Indian scroll. Sounds cool.<span id="more-7228"></span></p>
<p>The book and its review are not relevant to me. But what I do find interesting is how Ms. Ingall find modern relevance to the story. She says that for children the story teaches the lessons of the &#8220;Peaceable Kingdom.&#8221; It&#8217;s a message that the world needs to be harmonious to exist. This is a great lesson for children. As for adults, it is a message that no matter what calamity may befall us or our children, we have hope in a better tomorrow. This is also a great lesson.</p>
<p>Why am I talking about this?</p>
<p>There are two things I want to take from her article. First, orthodox Jews have a tendency to think that we have a monopoly on <em>drush. </em>Sometimes we have a hard time remembering that non-orthodox Jews are also dealing with the challenges of the Torah and they often have great ideas that we can learn from. In this instance, making the flood story contemporary is a difficulty that we share. To be sure, there are some non-orthodox people who will dismiss the flood story as ancient literature with no lessons for today. But when they make an honest attempt to view the stories as eternal and take legitimate lessons from the story, we can incorporate them into our perspective on the story.</p>
<p>Secondly, as time passes, the stories of the Bible can begin to seem old or out of date. It is our job to find eternal meaning in these stories because they were given to us as eternal stories. There are many ways to do this. We can hyper-literalize or we can adapt our thinking or try many other ideas in between the two. There is definitely value in seeking modern lessons in ancient stories. Most importantly, these stories remain in our collective subconscious and demand that we address them. Children love the flood story. Every culture has a flood story. There has to be a reason for this and more importantly, these stories become part of our DNA. Excising the stories or rejecting the stories is to reject a part of ourselves.</p>
<p>There is something universal about the flood story. You&#8217;ll find it has appeal across the spectrum of Judaism. For example, the Skirball Center in Los Angeles has a yearly Ark Exhibit that is visited by tens of thousands of people. Most of them are not orthodox. Even our less orthodox brethren love the flood story for its many teachings and lessons. We could learn a thing or two from them on this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2603_MEDIUM.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7226" alt="2603_MEDIUM" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2603_MEDIUM-300x272.jpg" width="300" height="272" /></a>Yesterday, in an article in Newsday, the world was introduced to the term Tuna Beigel. Now it&#8217;s time to retire it.</p>
<p>A little Googling will yield plenty of results for the term and almost all of them are negative. It&#8217;s used to describe people born to chasidic families who modernize. They keep many of the exterior elements of chasidishe life but lead lives that are not insular at all. They are familiar with popular culture, they have less rigid ideas about modesty, and they live outside the chasidic enclaves. However, I would say that these people are by and large orthodox. If they leave orthodoxy they leave this group.</p>
<p>For non-chasidim, these people can seem odd. They don&#8217;t speak English well, they are under-educated, they have chasidishe foibles and tendencies. Because of these barriers they don&#8217;t really integrate perfectly into the mainstream yeshiva world or into the modern orthodox world. Hence, they have their own group and their own name. The separate name and their lack of integration are an indictment of the frum world. Non-chasidim must do a better job of welcoming those who left insular community. Titles that mock their difficult choice would not a good way of doing this.</p>
<p>The problem is that Tuna Beigel is a pejorative.<span id="more-7225"></span> It is used to mock their Yinglish and I am told that many people use it derisively and many feel derided by the word. Of course there are many people from this group that use the word proudly. They are not insulted by the word at all. But too many people find the term offensive for it to be used in civilized conversation.</p>
<p>Personally, I compare it to using the &#8220;off the derech&#8221; to describe someone who left orthodox Judaism. I try very hard not to use that description because I think it is offensive. It tells those who left orthodox Judaism that they are off the path which implies that they are defective. While it&#8217;s true that orthodox Jews believe there is a path and those who left are not on the path, calling attention to that is implicitly offensive. Now, some people who fit into that category don&#8217;t find it offensive. That&#8217;s cool. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that we should use it. You&#8217;ll not find a single mention of that phrase on this blog unless I am quoting or paraphrasing someone else. That&#8217;s because I find it offensive.</p>
<p>Similarly, the term for modernized chasidim should not be offensive. In fact, I believe they should be celebrated and embraced. They are heroes. They are choosing our life. And it&#8217;s even more impressive that they are staying within the confines of orthodox Judaism even after having left the insular community. That&#8217;s the interesting thing about the article in Newsday. It&#8217;s a growing phenomenon and we hope it continues to grow.</p>
<p>In my private life I don&#8217;t use the word Tuna Beigel. In my public life I do not want to use it either and I don&#8217;t want others to use it. Try Modern Chasidim if you need a title. That&#8217;s what I use and I think it is a respectful and accurate description. (Modern Orthodox doesn&#8217;t work because that group stands for Torah U&#8217;Mada, excellence in secular education and high professional accomplishment. Hopefully the next generation of Modern Chasidim can grow into that.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s stop using this ugly term to describe Modern Chasidim. Let&#8217;s do a better job of helping them integrate into the non-chasidic world. If I offended anyone by my association with the article in Newsday, please forgive me. I admire the Modern Chasidim (and you ex-hasids too) and did not intend to hurt anyone. I hope we can work together to end the use of this term and create a brighter future for those who choose not to stay in the insular chasidic community.</p>
<p>(Also, I think the article is interesting. I was quoted a few times too.)</p>

Over the last few weeks I have been test driving the siddur.</p>
<p>For starters, I have never used such a beautiful prayer book. The pages are laid out very well. The typography is excellent and a pleasure to read, no italics thankfully. We are given basic instructions for the service throughout and I found them to be accurate and useful. The translation was decent enough. There were some odd choices, but it&#8217;s like a happy marriage between Artscroll and Koren. What sets apart <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is the photos.</p>
<p>Many of us have seen their &#8220;benchers&#8221; with gorgeous illustrative photos. That concept has now been extended to the Shabbat siddur. It is not without careful consideration and considerable hemming and hawing that the photos were deemed appropriate. Several writers in the introductory remarks justify the inclusion of photos in the siddur. Personally, I think it&#8217;s an acceptable idea and found using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> with its photos mostly a positive experience. Praying with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is an interesting journey and I appreciated the effort to explain the use of photos in the siddur.</p>
<p><span id="more-7054"></span></p>
<p>What struck me most about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> was that it does not idealize charedim. I know this sounds odd when talking about a siddur, but the photos editorialize the text. The ideals expressed in the photos are very Zionist, very religious, and very un-charedi.</p>
<p>For example, we photos of women learning gemara. We see young women IDF soldiers as we sing Eishes Chayil. The elderly man from <em>Na&#8217;ar hayisi, v&#8217;gam zakanti </em>is a non-charedi man as well. Where there are photos of young boys learning Torah, we have young girls learning Torah on the opposing page. There are even photos of women dancing. The photo for <em>sefiras ha&#8217;omer </em>is a field, not a <em>sefirot </em>or any other Zohar centric imagery. Even the Shabbos food in the photos is not charedi. No cholent and kugel here. It&#8217;s like a Mediterranean style feast.</p>
<p>There are scant picture of charedim. The photos of charedim that are in the siddur do not glorify the usualy hallmarks of charedi society. One photo of charedim is of a yeshiva boy dancing at a wedding. Another photo is the famous photo of a rabbi being leered and jeered at by Nazi officers as he stands in his talis and tefilin. It&#8217;s weird using a religious book with so little charedi influence. We are so accustomed to orthodox Judaism being a charedi centric religion. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> turns that on its head. Religious Zionism is seen as the ideal in this siddur.</p>
<p>I took issue with a few of the editorial choices. First, the verse <em>poseach es yadecha umasbia l&#8217;chol chai ratzon </em>is illustrated in the siddur just as it is illustrated in the bencher. We see third world children with hungry eyes and smiling faces on this page. It&#8217;s disconcerting for two reasons. 1) There is tremendous hunger in third world countries. It is ironic at best to be using these photos for this verse. 2. It&#8217;s makes the African, Southeast Asian, and Indian children look like props. Almost everyone else in the siddur is Jewish. Why use these third world children here? It&#8217;s odd. It leads to another strange editorial choice. For the phrase <em>yakiru v&#8217;yedu kol yoshvei tevel </em>they show Buddhists and some Asian people looking upward as if to imply they now see God. I don&#8217;t like this choice either. We have fellow Jews who have yet to discover or believe in God, why are we shifting the focus to these other people?<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Another quirk is that almost all the liturgy about the Exodus and redemption is reinterpreted to refer to the Holocaust and the State of Israel through photos. In other words, as you are reading about our bondage in Egypt you see Holocaust photos. And as you read about the redemption and ancient entry to the Land of Canaan, you see Zionist pioneers in the modern Israel. Non-Zionists might find this disconcerting. But I would hope that it could subversively influence skeptics about Israel to see the parallels and perhaps embrace the State of Israel more fully.</p>
<p>Of course more of the photos are of outer space and nature panoramas. These photos are not editorial at all and I believe greatly enhance one&#8217;s appreciation of the liturgy.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is a great &#8220;change-up&#8221; siddur. I would not use it every week because I think the photos would fade into the pages and we would not even notice them anymore. But I certainly recommend buying at least one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> siddur and sharing it with your family. Let a different family member use it each week and I am sure your appreciation for the Shabbos prayers will increase.</p>
<p>Buy on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7202" alt="131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>Every group or cause needs a spokesperson. There is no more eloquent a spokesperson for her cause than Leah Vincent. (No offense to the rest of her group intended.)</p>
<p>Leah represented herself and Footsteps quite nicely on Katie Couric&#8217;s show, creatively named Katie. Every story about someone leaving the ultra-orthodox community has the potential to be a huge chillul Hashem and an abject failure. My sense of the segment on Katie was that despite the significant obstacles placed before her, Leah has been very successful in her personal and professional life. The segment veered from a discussion about the flaws or problems in her community. In fact, it almost glossed over them.</p>
<p>If one was looking for a chillul Hashem, I think it would be hard to find one in this segment. It was much easier to see chillul Hashem in previous television appearances by those who left ultra-orthodox Judaism. I think it speaks to Leah&#8217;s dignity and demeanor that the segment was so respectful.<span id="more-7200"></span></p>
<p>Leah&#8217;s story is harrowing. She points to two traumatic incidents in the segment. One ended her childhood and the other ended her life. When her parents cut her off, Leah was forced to live on her own, work minimum wage jobs just to survive. It&#8217;s not clear what her level of observance was at the time, but I gather that she was still orthodox. Unfortunately, this kind of thing happens in our community. It&#8217;s being worked on and hopefully we will see less and less of this odd form of &#8220;tough love&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then she was raped. Leah was obviously trying to control her emotions when she talked about this second traumatic event. She pushed through it displaying great strength and courage. I do wonder what happened to her attacker. Nothing was mentioned about that.</p>
<p>I found it interesting how Leah still calls the world of her childhood &#8220;my sect&#8221;. She still identifies with the community. I guess that&#8217;s a good thing, but I also think it shows how hard it is to leave.</p>
<p>Here is what is a little different about Leah&#8217;s story. She is not from a chasidic background. She got a decent secular education and speaks English perfectly. Others who have left orthodox Judaism, leave with a rudimentary education at best, and a speech handicap that may appear to limit them. Also, being from the non-chasidic world, it is more likely that Leah encountered Jews who were not ultra-orthodox in her childhood. The level of insularity in her world is less than in the chasidic world.*</p>
<p>Which leads me to the real purpose behind the segment. I think the goal was to publicize the work of <a href="footstepsorg.org" target="_blank">Footsteps</a>. On the show, Footsteps was said to provide a safe place for those who left orthodox Judaism and especially ultra-orthodox Judaism. They tend to social and psychological needs as well as practical needs of those who left orthodoxy. People like Leah, who needed friendship and emotional support. Others need help getting GEDs or jobs or speaking English properly.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of orthodox Jews who look at Footsteps as the enemy. They see them as the group that is making it easier to leave and as part of the problem. Or worse, they seem them as evangelizing those who are still in the community and influencing them to leave.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see it this way at all.</p>
<p>The people who need Footsteps are our brothers, sisters, cousins, children, and grandchildren. They are our family. Our system didn&#8217;t work for them. No system can work for everyone. Are we to leave them to die in the streets? If we have not prepared them for life on the outside, we are failing our duty to our own family members. If we do not provide them with warmth and support even after they leave, they must get that love and support somewhere. Footsteps is doing that work.</p>
<p>Of course, I would prefer to see our community provide these services. I would rather we all learn English and earn high school diplomas. I would love it if we could stay connected emotionally to those of us who leave. And we are working on all that. Hopefully we will get there soon. But in the meantime, Footsteps is doing <em>our </em>work by helping those in our community who leave. We must express our dismay that there is a need for Footsteps. We must also express our appreciation for Footsteps. They are doing our holy work of taking care of our children for us.</p>
<p>So long as Footsteps is not actively trying to draw people out of our community I think they should have our support. If they do attempt to subversively foster dissent and revolt, I can&#8217;t see how we can embrace their mission. Either way, we must thank them for taking care of our family members. So, thank you Footsteps.</p>
<p><em>*UPDATE: Leah&#8217;s background is non-conventional. She grew up in a non-insular community but her family tried to live an isolated life.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/history-minor.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7144" alt="history-minor" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/history-minor-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a>Conor Friedersdorf has an excellent article on theatlantic.com called &#8220;<a href="ve/2013/05/history-is-beautiful-things-made-by-people-with-ugly-ideas/276328/" target="_blank">History Is Beautiful Things Made by People With Ugly Ideas</a>&#8220;. He argues that a graduate student who refuses to sing a song written by Walt Whitman because Whitman was a racist is wrong. The song itself is not racist however its composer said some very racists things in his life.</p>
<p>Friedersdorf writes that history is full of flawed men and women who did things that we would find abhorrent today. If we disregard their accomplishments because we are looking at them through modern glasses we lose all their contributions to society. Taking this idea to the extreme, it would be akin to not performing a surgery because the person who discovered or refined the technique was a racist or a bigot. We would lose almost all modern progress if the only people from whom we accepted their ideas or inventions were perfect people.</p>
<p>Instead we must view our forebears as products of a time where things were different than they are today. Even if it was the same world, modernity is built upon the ideas of flawed people.<span id="more-7143"></span></p>
<p>Reading this, I thought about how valuable this perspective of history can be to religions in general and Judaism in particular. The greatest contributors to Judaism over our history were incredible scholars and masters of the soul. They perfected their understanding of Torah and worked on their character to be saintly as they could be. In order to truly appreciate Torah, one must be a master over one&#8217;s spirit as well. Our Torah heroes accomplished all that and more.</p>
<p>But it would be foolish to think that anything that they thought must be flawless. They were not. It would be equally foolish to dismiss all of their contributions and accomplishments simply because of those flaws or mistakes. Ideas stand on their own. The ideas of our Judaism stand on the shoulders of giants. Just because those giants were not perfect does not mean that their ideas should be rejected.</p>
<p>However, if we, like the graduate student, expect flawlessness from our leaders we will be faced with two options. Either we can reinterpret everything they did and said to reflect our expectations of perfection or we will be forced to rid ourselves of all the incredible insights and contributions because we discover that they were not perfect.</p>
<p>I know which option makes the most sense to me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7137" alt="DoubleLife-Cover" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DoubleLife-Cover-231x300.jpg" width="231" height="300" /></a>I received a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife: One Family, Two Faiths and a Journey of Hope</a> a few weeks ago. It took a while for me to actually  sit down and read the book but I read it over the weekend and will do my usual review with a side of analysis on the book.</p>
<p>The story is quite intriguing. A Jewish man who makes a living playing music at Church and a Christian woman who does the same fall in love, get married, and end up as orthodox Jews. There&#8217;s a lot of blanks to fill in and the book does a fair job of telling their story.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to notice the book&#8217;s most obvious shtick right away. The entire story is told in letters between Harold and Gayle. Harold&#8217;s letters are written in regular typeset and Gayle&#8217;s are in italics. I found this very distracting. I don&#8217;t like italics. But that might be a personal quirk.</p>
<p>The larger issue is that it seems so artificial. Everything is written in letter format. Even things that couples obviously already know about one another. Normal people do not write letters to each other that ask the big questions like &#8220;will we have a Christmas tree or Hanukkah bush in our home&#8221;. Normal couples do not express themselves in letters to the exclusion of anything else. Yet, the book expects us to believe that all these important conversations took place via letters. Either these are real letters, which is just odd or it&#8217;s a gimmick. Making things worse, in order for this to work logistically, the two of them are almost never together. He is writing about his life, she is writing about her life, but because of the format we rarely get a feel for what life is like for the two of them when they are together. Some people might like this format choice, but I did not. It was weird.</p>
<p><span id="more-7134"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> tells the reader a lot about how difficult life can be for intermarried couples. They really don&#8217;t fit in anywhere. The Christian community does not embrace Howard and Gayle and we all know how skeptical the Jewish community can be of intermarried couples. I was surprised that the more liberal branches of Judaism were so antagonistic toward Howard and Gayle. It could just be that this was their experience and others have had different experiences. But reading the book, one would think that Reform and Conservative rabbis and communities are not welcoming to intermarried couples. This might be true in general, but all one can say from the book is that this was the experience of this couple. I would not say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> dishonestly portrays the positions of other denominations to puff up orthodox Judaism, but it at some points it did feel like that a little bit.</p>
<p>The punchline of the book is that the one place that welcomed Howard and Gayle more than any other was the orthodox Jewish community. In the end, despite their reservations, especially Gayle&#8217;s, the couple settled in the orthodox Jewish community. Gayle had a full orthodox conversion and the couple is has been living as orthodox Jews ever since. I do admit to completely breaking down during the conversion scene in the book. It was very emotional and I felt that the book did an excellent job making the moment work as a true climax of the story.</p>
<p>I wish the book would have spent some more time dealing with the theology of becoming an orthodox Jew. Gayle struggles with it quite a bit and we are never really told what changed her mind from resistance to acceptance of orthodox Judaism. I suspect it was mostly an emotional decision but I thought we should have heard a bit more about the transition.</p>
<p>The book tells a great story, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> also seeks to carve out a place for intermarried couples in orthodox Judaism. On the one hand their story seems to say that they are welcome with open arms, but on the other hand it seems that more resources are needed to handle these situations in the orthodox community. To that end <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> promotes the website created by Howard and Gayle for intermarried couples <a href="http://j-journey.org">j-journey.org</a>. The site seems to focus on orthodox conversion exclusively.</p>
<p>This all leads me to the piercing unasked question raised by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. What should be the Jewish approach to intermarriage. In a generation where more Jews intermarry than &#8220;intramarry,&#8221; what is the best way to handle it?</p>
<p>As it stands now, we discourage intermarriage so vociferously that orthodox rabbis will not officiate the ceremony of an intermarried couple. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> seems to indicate that Reform and Conservative rabbis will not officiate either. What chance do we have of ingratiating an intermarried couple back into Judaism if we can&#8217;t participate in their wedding? I am not saying that we should ignore halacha, God forbid. I am only saying that we stack the deck against the intermarried couple that it becomes extremely difficult to include them in our communities. It is something that we need to work on and I think the Bermans are doing good work by trying to make orthodox Judaism more inclusive for intermarried couples.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. It&#8217;s worthwhile to read the book just to sense of the difficulties that intermarried couples encounter in their spiritual journeys. But more importantly, the book raises questions we must answer about how we handle intermarriage in the modern world. If you have read the book, I welcome your thoughts as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7128" alt="alaska-erosion-photo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" /></a>The fallout over the Doheny Kosher meat scandal continues. This week, the Jewish Journal reported that three kosher restaurants have dropped the RCC Hechsher in favor of alternative hechshers.</p>
<p>This can only mean one thing. RCC is not as good for the bottom line as the other hechshers. The only real reason a restaurant will switch is to increase business. It seems that RCC businesses are suffering. I have some first hand information from vendors that this is the case as well.</p>
<p>It goes even further. Shiloh&#8217;s Restaurant has a splash page of their website that assures customers that they are and always have been using Kehilla for their hechsher and not RCC. The note distances Shiloh&#8217;s from Doheny Kosher Meat as well. See the note here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gUiNl0R.png" target="_blank">Shiloh&#8217;s</a></p>
<p>All this can only mean one thing. A significant number of people have been spooked by the kashrus scandal. It goes so far that people need to be reassured that a kosher restaurant did not purchase any meat from Doheny.<span id="more-7127"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. The halachic authority who was counseled on this case and is a senior <em>posek</em> for the OU already said that there was no halachic problem for consumers or restaurants who bought from Doheny. The RCC has admitted there were issues and they are fixing them. Some of the restaurants that switched don&#8217;t even sell meat!</p>
<p>The point here is that people are basically ignoring the halachic psak given in this case. Who are these people? Are they <em>frummer</em> than halacha? Why would anyone be concerned if a restaurant got meat from Doheny? The psak is that there is no problem if one bought meat from Doheny? What are they worried about?</p>
<p>The funny thing is that people will harp on Daas Torah for every <em>chumra</em> or <em>hashkafic</em> nuance as long as it looks more frum. But the second Daas Torah says something is permissible those same people become independent thinkers who don&#8217;t rely on Daas Torah.</p>
<p>On the one hand I see this as an erosion of Daas Torah. Some might see that as a positive development. Some might see that as a negative development. Either way, it seems that people are not buying into Daas Torah completely. It&#8217;s only when it suits my <em>chumra</em> lifestyle or to marginalize others that I will listen to Daas Torah they say. On the other hand not trusting RCC (especially for dairy!) after a <em>psak</em> that says there is nothing to worry about from a halachic perspective, is a huge problem. If we do not rely on our <em>poskim</em> for <em>heter</em> we are in big trouble. I do not like the direction this is heading. We must be able to rely on <em>psak halacha, </em>especially when the halacha is lenient.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/76042168.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7120" alt="Baltimore Orioles v Toronto Blue Jays" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/76042168-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>The Baltimore Orioles were in Toronto for a match-up with the Blue Jays last night. It may seem like your average AL East battle between two up and coming teams, or it could just be a symbolic contest between the two cities with Ner Israel yeshivas, Ner Israel Baltimore and Ner Israel Toronto. (No relation)</p>
<p>One bochur attended the game and I doubt he expected he would be caught on camera during the game. Surely he did not think he would be one of the stars of ESPN SportsCenter.</p>
<p>I hope he wasn&#8217;t skipping <em>seder.</em></p>
<p>Colby Rasmus hit a ball deep into foul territory just foul of left field. Nate McLouth made a spectacular attempt to catch the ball diving into the stands mere inches from our baseball loving yeshiva bochur. It wasn&#8217;t absolutely clear whether the ball was caught. The bochur attempted to clarify matters for the umpire by signaling that it was no catch. In one SportsCenter broadcast, fellow member of the tribe Steve Levy was narrating the highlight and he said something about how &#8220;you got to trust the kid in the cap&#8221; (referring to the bochur&#8217;s yarmulka). The umpire would have none of it and called the batter out.</p>
<p>Clearly the bochur is a Blue Jays fan and he got caught up in the moment. He must have thought he saw the ball pop out of McLouth&#8217;s glove. I&#8217;d hate to think he got caught lying intentionally on national television.</p>
<p><em><strong>EDIT</strong>: The bochur is sticking to his story in the comments below. He says the ball popped out. However, even if the ball did pop out it was a catch before McLouth crashed over the wall. So the umpire made the correct call.</em></p>
<p>The amazing catch finished the night as the SportsCenter Top Play of the night. The catch and the bochur were shown on TV dozens of times. The bochur is famous!<span id="more-7117"></span></p>
<p>Fortunately, the bochur had no part in the beer throwing incident moments later that resulted in the ejection of the guilty fan in the same vicinity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/conspiracy-theory-alert.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7112" alt="conspiracy-theory-alert" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/conspiracy-theory-alert-300x262.jpg" width="300" height="262" /></a>One would think that the Internet would be good for at least one thing. It should help debunk conspiracies. After all, all one needs to do is do a little Googling to find out if there are actual facts to support a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Compared with the pre-Internet dark ages, it would seem to be much easier to debunk conspiracies. But in fact the opposite is true. Conspiracies proliferate on the Internet. People find confirmation for their ideas on the Internet, no matter how crazy the ideas may be, and so the Internet provides more fuel to the fire of conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>The NY Times published an article trying to explain why rational people believe in conspiracies and what kind of people believe in conspiracies.</p>
<p>It seems that the primary factors of conspiracy theorists are cynicism about the world, cynicism about politics, low self-worth, and a feeling of powerlessness. In other words, believing in conspiracies may be a defense mechanism against these sorts of feelings. Correlation does not equal causation, obviously, but there is some reasoning behind this as well.</p>
<p>When people feel like they have little say in the world and they feel that the world is &#8220;out to get them&#8221; they can regain some semblance of control by claiming to have inside information and a broader understanding of what is happening in the world.<span id="more-7111"></span></p>
<p>Reacting to the news that a formerly chasidic woman lost custody of her children, many people see a conspiracy. They see a judge that is biased because she is bought by chasidic groups. Or they see a a judge who favors a religious home over a secular home. Or they see a judge who is afraid to stand up to a very powerful chasidic community. All of these things are possible. However, there are also legitimate reasons she lost custody.</p>
<p>Seeing things that may or may not be there to support an overarching narrative is conspiracy-like. It also fits in well with the typology of people who buy into a conspiracy. Many of the people buying into the conspiracy are ex-hasids who are cynical about the chasidic world (rightfully so!), may feel marginalized by that world (they are), and are certainly likely to feel powerless in that world. It&#8217;s empowering to have an overarching narrative to explain what happened.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that there is a conspiracy, but I don&#8217;t think it is supported by the facts that I read. I don&#8217;t begrudge anyone for trying to advocate on the mother&#8217;s behalf and I support those who do not want courts to include any religious considerations in custody proceedings. But I think there is a reason</p>
<p>I think this can also relate to people who buy into <em>segulos</em> and magical mystical mystery thinking. People who are cynical about the world because of anti-Semitism or theologically based xenophobia, who feel powerless because the world is &#8220;out to get them&#8221; or because there are dark forces that are making things difficult, are prime candidates to turn to solutions not based in reality. They will use &#8220;spiritual&#8221; cures for illness or everyday superstition or they turn to snake oil salesmen pitching salvation for the same reasons people believe in conspiracies. I think they are very similar.</p>
<p>In politics I think this bears out as well. <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/05/oklahoma-tornado-conspiracy-theories/65499/" target="_blank">People who think President Obama made the tornado</a> with a fancy weather maker to distract from current political scandals match some of these factors. They think Obama is out to get them. They think that they are doomed. They think they are powerless to stop Obama. So they turn to conspiracy theories to empower themselves as the ones who &#8220;get it&#8221;.</p>
<p>As we learn more about the brain we will learn more about why people think the way they do. We live in exciting times. Although, I am concerned that the NY Times is a conspiracy newspaper written by Jews to achieve world domination. You can read about it in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. (Just kidding!)</p>

<p>It seems the &#8220;impossible&#8221; has happened again. Kelly Myzner lost custody of her children last week.</p>
<p>I have not seen the court documents. Although I have read a few articles about the case and I am well aware that every situation has at least two sides to the story.</p>
<p>If you want to see one version of the facts go to Unpious and read <a href="http://www.unpious.com/2013/05/ex-hasidic-mother-loses-custody-of-children/">Ex-Hasidic Mother Loses Custody of Children</a> by Shulem Deen. Whether the facts are the way the ex-hasid community presents them or not, the phenomena is real.<span id="more-7101"></span></p>
<p>It is true that <em>baalei teshuva </em>in the chasidic community will be set up with less than stellar matches. It is true that sometimes those less than stellar young men or women have personality defects. It is true that personality defects worsen in one&#8217;s 20&#8242;s and are further exacerbated by marriage and parenthood. It is true that people who are in bad marriages will see the worst of their society and will look outside their community. It is true that people in a marriage can get fed up with one another and find themselves in completely different religious spheres. Sometimes the couple will seek divorce.</p>
<p>What happens next is the real point here.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the primary caregiver &#8211; usually the mother, is awarded primary custody. However, sometimes the mother is denied custody for a potpourri of reasons. One reason that has been used in court proceedings is that the children should stay in the same religious environment. Usually this means that the parent who is deviating will lose custody. When it is the mother, the courts will sometimes deny the mother custody.</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons for this: First, the assumption could be that deviating from the agreed upon religious beliefs in the marriage is like a breach of contract. She breached, so he wins. Second, deviating could be viewed as a a symptom of imbalance. Third, the children have a status quo of religious practice and taking that away from them and them away from it is unfair collateral damage. Fourth, the court systems are rigged and they are bought and paid for by the ultra-orthodox community. Fifth, the ultra-orthodox community projects a unified front and unwavering support for their own so the chances that the children will be cared for increases within the ultra-orthodox community. Sixth, the ultra-orthodox community pays for a super-lawyer while the deviating party gets by with a legal aid lawyer and the super-lawyer wins.</p>
<p>I am not saying that all these reasons are true, fair, or valid. However, they are all part of the equation. So I don&#8217;t think that the sole reason anyone loses custody is because they deviated from the religious beliefs. But religion is definitely used as a weapon in these proceedings.</p>
<p>My feeling is that the children of these families are going to need their mothers more than most children. They will have a hard time throughout their lives due to the disparate religious beliefs of their parents and families. As long as the mother is a good mother, the mother should be taking care of the children. A good mother has nothing to do with religion. Good mothers are everywhere, not just in the ultra-orthodox community.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be a very strong reason to deny the mother custody. I don&#8217;t think that being an atheist is a valid reason. More importantly, I don&#8217;t love the idea of the secular court system weighing the religious beliefs of the parents to determine custody. It&#8217;s probably not a good idea and it might not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.</p>
<p>Most importantly, using children as pawns in any custody battle is deplorable. But when children are used to keep people in the fold we cross the line from deplorable to cult-like. The community does not own the children. That is what happens in a cult. Parents are responsible to raise their children as they deem fit. If the parents have differing opinions on those issues, it is their issue and they must resolve it. But using the brute force of a strong insular community to win the day is just not acceptable.</p>
<p><em>If I see the court documents I will be able to confirm the particulars of this case. In the meantime these are my general thoughts.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7081" alt="91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_-230x300.jpg" width="230" height="300" /></a>Over the weekend it was reported that a teacher in an orthodox Jewish school in Seattle has been charged with molesting two six year old girls in his class. It is suspected that this fellow molested more than just the two girls but he is only charged with molesting the two girls.</p>
<p>Sex abuse happens everywhere. It is no indictment of a school, community, or family if sex abuse occurs. The test is how sex abuse is dealt with. The most important question is whether the victim is able to articulate that they have been abused and that the victim has a safe place to talk about the abuse. If no one comes forward there is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>It takes great courage to come forward. But more importantly, it takes education to come forward. Our best defense against abuse is quite simply our children. If they are equipped with the tools necessary to prevent molestation and report it when it happens we have our first two lines of defense in place.</p>
<p>The prosecutor in the case in Seattle attributes the girls&#8217; willingness to come forward and their ability to articulate what happened to a book that is the brainchild of Rabbi Yakov Horowitz, written by Bracha Goetz and illustrated by Tova Leff. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a>. Incredibly, it took years for this book to see the light of day. But now it is endorsed by leading Torah authorities and it must be in every home and every school.</p>
<p><span id="more-7080"></span></p>
<p>In a sensitive way, the book gives children the tools to prevent abuse. When the book was released, I bought several copies of the book for my home and anywhere else I thought it necessary.</p>
<p>Just consider for a moment how incredible it is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> helped end a cycle of abuse in Seattle. It could do the same in your community. Get the book.</p>
<p>In places where abuse is not reported and not even acknowledged there is too much space for predators to wreak havoc. It is a matter of <em>sakanas nefashos, </em>we must act now. Our children must be educated. There are no excuses. We must educate our most insular communities on the harms of abuse and help them help themselves get out from under the cycle of abuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> is so versatile that it is not only a book that prevents abuse. The book also keeps children safe generally. Rabbi Horowitz shared with me a letter that he received from a learning disabled child thanking him for the book as it helped him in several situations. The letter is so sweet and innocent, it brought tears to my eyes. It is time for us to take this challenge and grab it by the horns. The first step is buying and using this book.</p>
<p>Aside from the book, Rabbi Horowitz has an excellent video on keeping our children safe. Watch that here: <a href="http://youtu.be/LWQHaInsCGk" target="_blank">YouTube</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jerusalem051013_001-4_3_rx1443_c1920x1440.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7076" alt="jerusalem051013_001-4_3_rx1443_c1920x1440" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jerusalem051013_001-4_3_rx1443_c1920x1440-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>Last night, I was asked by Zev Brenner what I thought of the Women of the Wall vs. the Women for the Wall. I sidestepped the question on the radio but these are my thoughts.</em></p>
<p>Rosh Chodesh is supposed to be a day of renewal for the Jewish people and a special day in recognition of Jewish women. This past Rosh Chodesh at the Kotel women engaged in a fierce turf war.</p>
<p>For several years the Women of the Wall have held their Rosh Chodesh service at the Kotel. They wear prayer shawls, some wear tefillin, and they read from the Torah. This violated the rules of the Kotel and arrests were routinely made. The Israel courts determined that these rules were illegal and the Women of the Wall looked forward to a peaceful service, finally. But it was not to be. A new group called the Woman for the Wall who support traditional orthodox Judaism and oppose the Women of the Wall organized a huge counter protest.<span id="more-7075"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times reports:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Heeding calls from their rabbis, religious teenage girls turned up in large numbers to protest the group’s insistence on praying at the wall in religious garb traditionally worn by men. The girls crammed the women’s section directly in front of the wall by 6:30 a.m., forcing the liberal women to conduct their prayer service farther back on the plaza. There, hundreds of police officers locked arms in cordons to hold back throngs of black-hatted Orthodox men who whistled, catcalled, and threw water, candy and a few plastic chairs.</em></p>
<p>There were thousands of people there. I am sure that most of them were well behaved. I am sure that only a few of them contributed to the mayhem. But I am also sure that some people made fools out of themselves and a few even got arrested.</p>
<p>At this point, the issue of Women and the Wall has been so needlessly escalated that it seems unlikely a resolution will be reached. When I think about what has happened over the last few months I feel sad. I feel sad because this didn&#8217;t have to happen. Most of this is senseless outrage and manufactured controversy.</p>
<p>Go back a few months. Imagine the Kotel authority just looked the other way when a small group of women prayed in a different way than the other women. The Women of the Wall were not proselytizing, they were not trying to win converts, they were not trying to make a revolution at the Kotel. They just wanted to pray the way they like to pray. Is it the way orthodox Jewish women pray? Not usually. Is it halachically acceptable? Barely. But there is definitely room to allow it. The Women of the Wall would be a small blip on the Kotel radar as they have been for several years now. Especially now that the court sided in their favor, this Rosh Chodesh would have passed with little fanfare. The Women of the Wall would have done their thing without threat of arrest and no one would have been in the news or in jail.</p>
<p>Instead a massive counter protest was manufactured. Not too many people seemed bothered by the small group of Women of the Wall. No one really felt so outraged that they needed to do something about it. People noticed, or didn&#8217;t notice, and that was it. No big deal. Until last week. Until people were told to care, they didn&#8217;t. As was appropriate.</p>
<p>The organizers tapped into the two things that are guaranteed to draw big numbers: Daas Torah and paranoia about non-orthodox Jews. The rabbis said to go protest and so they went to protest. The pretext for the protest was that the Women of the Wall were out to uproot the sanctity of the Kotel and over time they were out to erode the very essence of orthodox Judaism. If that sounds crazy, it&#8217;s because it is. How can a few dozen women carry so much power? Why do the ultra-orthodox even care what they are doing? I don&#8217;t have the answer to that question and I have yet to see a satisfactory answer from anyone else.</p>
<p>They should have been left alone. Instead, thousands of people came to the Kotel on Friday and turned it into a battleground. And for what? Is there really any legitimate fear that charedi Judaism is in danger of being subverted by a few dozen women? Are we so paranoid, so insecure about our <em>frumkeit?</em> Is seeing some women praying in non-traditional ways such a danger?</p>
<p>The part that hurts me the most is that these women are not sinning, they are praying! While many may not agree with the manner in which they are praying, it boggles the mind that orthodox Jews would stifle prayer at the Kotel or anywhere for that matter. If we really believe that prayer is a mitzvah, and praying brings us closer to God, why would we deny others the same opportunity?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like the Women of the Wall are fornicating, <em>chas v&#8217;shalom, </em>at the Kotel. They are praying. We should be encouraging them. We should be impressed with their dedication to their prayers. We should be taking note that non-orthodox Jews can also be religious. Instead we are scared of them and their ideas. We let our fear turn into hate and violence. Our public statement to the world is that we cannot allow anyone to pray in a way that makes us a tad uncomfortable. In the end, I think this says a lot more about us than it says about them.</p>
<p>It is sad that it has come to this. Jew against Jew. One groups seeking the right to pray and the other doing their best to stop them. The script has been flipped. This is not a proud moment for us.</p>
<p>Tensions are high. Anger and rhetoric is escalating. I hope we can find within ourselves to cool off a bit, take a step back, and try to find common ground with the Women of the Wall. Maybe we can even see that it&#8217;s possible that God is smiling, <em>k&#8217;vyachol,</em> over these women who may not be as orthodox as some of us, but are yearning to connect to Him in the best way that they know how.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7073" alt="Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237-200x300.jpeg" width="200" height="300" /></a>The Rosh Yeshiva of Ner Israel, Rabbi Aharon Feldman has apologized to MK Rabbi Dov Lipman for calling him a <em>rasha.</em> In his apology, R&#8217; Feldman says that he believes the MK Lipman is <em>&#8220;l&#8217;shem shamayim&#8221;</em> and wants what is best for the Jewish people including the charedim in Israel. Because of these revelations, R&#8217; Feldman says that MK Lipman is misguided but not a <em>rasha.</em></p>
<p>R&#8217; Feldman makes the case that MK Lipman is wrong or misguided using traditional Torah sources and accepted wisdom in the yeshiva world. He very emphatically disagrees with MK Lipman but the discourse is civil.</p>
<p>Initially, I was hurt and saddened when I read R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s original remarks. While I can&#8217;t say I am thrilled with his position on this issue, there is something positive that I can say. R&#8217; Aharon Feldman showed the charedi world what it means to be an honest <em>eved Hashem.</em> It takes guts to apologize. It always takes guts. But it takes ten times more guts when you are the Rosh Yeshiva of a prominent Torah institution and the subject of your apology is <em>persona non grata </em>in the charedi world. It could not have been easy to apologize but it was the right thing to do and for that I admire R&#8217; Feldman.</p>
<p>Further, R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s apology and argument is so different than the other recent charedi responses and rhetoric towards MK Lipman. It was respectful and somewhat positive. Again, I don&#8217;t love R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s position on this issue. But I do appreciate how stark the difference is between the way he is handling this and the way some other charedim are handling it.<span id="more-7072"></span></p>
<p>Look, it is easy to be cynical and say that R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s speech was more of the same. But I see it differently. There was some dignity in this dispute and it was not laced with disgust and revulsion. It&#8217;s sad to say it, but that is a huge improvement and I hope that those who jumped on R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s bandwagon when he called MK Lipman a <em>rasha</em> are just as quickly jumping on his bandwagon of toning down the rhetoric.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t intend to come off as one with a bias of low expectations. Not at all. I am simply comparing what R&#8217; Feldman said and did in his apology with what I have been hearing from pseudonymous writers on frum sites and their commenters. It&#8217;s a breath of fresh air and I applaud R&#8217; Feldman for doing what was right.</p>
<p>One level deeper, it gives me hope that others can see that R&#8217; Feldman is simply trying to do what is <em>emes.</em> He is not attempting character assassination for the sake of a cause. He thinks MK Lipman is wrong and told him so. But he sounds reasonable. I think the difference stems from something he alluded to in his apology. R&#8217; Feldman said that MK Lipman is a <em>shogeig</em> and a <em>shogeig</em> isn&#8217;t a <em>rasha.</em> What he means is that he is looking at his through a lens of halacha. He is not looking at it through a lens of pure politics.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are counter arguments to R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s opinion. My point here is not to say that R&#8217; Feldman made his arguments so convincingly that the discussion is closed. Rather, the way R&#8217; Feldman spoke to MK Lipman means that there is hope the discussion is still open.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/internet_censor_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7047" alt="internet_censor_1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/internet_censor_1-300x204.jpg" width="300" height="204" /></a>(Back to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/04/30/pharisees-sadducees-and-karaites/" target="_blank">Pharisees and Sadducees</a> tomorrow. Maybe.)</em></p>
<p>Today is May 1. That means that it&#8217;s the day Paul Miller returns to the Internet. Around the same time as the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/20/the-asifa-is-done-i-was-fooled/" target="_blank">Internet Asifa last year</a>, a blogger for <a href="theverge.comhttp://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4279674/im-still-here-back-online-after-a-year-without-the-internet" target="_blank">The Verge</a> decided to leave the world of the Internet for one full year. It was his hope that during this year he would embark on a year of self-discovery and return to his true self and not the Internet Paul Miller.</p>
<p>This was a happy coincidence for those who promoted the Asifa but because they viewed his journey as a vindication for their perspective that the Internet was horrible and responsible for destroying society. The Asifa even gets a mention in his article.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been one year and Paul Miller has returned to the Internet. Paul Miller has written an overview essay of what he learned during his year away from the Internet and some of the things he discovered may surprise the Ichud Hakehilos. But they should not surprise people that use the Internet and people that are aware of the problems on the Internet because those people realize that the Internet is not a problem nor is the solution is a tool and no matter what problems one as they want to be solved or avoided by using Internet.<span id="more-7046"></span></p>
<p>Miller writes that at first he was so amazed at how into he was with life and he felt bad leaving Internet was definitely a positive idea. He was reading more he was enjoying life more he was doing the things that he always felt he wanted to do but the Internet took him away from those things. In many respects the first few months after leaving the Internet with the best months of Miller&#8217;s life. But nirvana was elusive and slowly his life returned to its normal state as it was during Internet use , albeit without the Internet. The feelings of success gave way to feelings of failure.</p>
<p>It might feel good not to be bombarded with email, and text messages, Facebook notifications, but after a few weeks of using regular mail we become equally bombarded with snail mail and voice messages. While it may be exciting to reach out to people in person or only by the phone, it can be quite upsetting not to keep up relationships with people around the world who don&#8217;t have regular access to phones or don&#8217;t write letters but would have easy access to the Internet. Miller&#8217;s comment about Facebook friends is quite revealing:<em> &#8220;So much ink has been spilled deriding the false concept of a &#8220;Facebook friend,&#8221; but I can tell you that a &#8220;Facebook friend&#8221; is better than nothing.<strong>&#8220; </strong></em></p>
<p>It turns out that not having the Internet makes life the same, just without the Internet. It doesn&#8217;t solve anything, it doesn&#8217;t make any problems disappear, it just changes your problems. Our world is a world with Internet. Our lives are shared and experienced through the Internet. This is neither good nor bad, this is just a fact. There are good and bad ways to live a life without the Internet and there are good and bad ways to live with the Internet.</p>
<p>The most important line of the entire essay is this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;What I do know is that I can&#8217;t blame the internet, or any circumstance, for my problems. I have many of the same priorities I had before I left the internet: family, friends, work, learning. And I have no guarantee I&#8217;ll stick with them when I get back on the internet — I probably won&#8217;t, to be honest. But at least I&#8217;ll know that it&#8217;s not the internet&#8217;s fault. I&#8217;ll know who&#8217;s responsible, and who can fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t this go against everything that we were told last year around the time of the Asifa? When we were told that our problems are because of the Internet and that our problems that we have in our lives can be solved by removing the Internet? Seems to me that a lot of what we were told has been demonstrated to be false in the case of Paul Miller.</p>
<p>But it is so much easier to blame the Internet for problems. It&#8217;s so much easier to blame something that we can just take out of our homes and then hope that everything will be all right. We wish there was a magic bullet, or a pill to just swallow. Get rid of the Internet and everything falls into place. This fails for two very important reasons. First of all, the Internet is not going anywhere and no matter how hard you try to get rid of it, the Internet will still be there. But more importantly the Internet is not the source of our problems. Our problems are more directly related to poor education, subpar parenting, shoddy morals and values, and the very narrow path or orthodox Judaism. All those problems exists with or without the Internet.</p>
<p>I have no problem whatsoever with groups of people organizing efforts to make the Internet safer for children and for adults. But to portrays the Internet as the devil and to assume that if we would just excise this devil from our midst everything will be fine is a completely destructive attitude towards the Internet and towards our communal issues. I am certain that there is not a single problem in our community that can be solved by getting rid of the Internet. I am equally certain that there are many problems that we have that can be solved by using the Internet.</p>
<p>Let us learn from Paul Miller&#8217;s experiment, the Internet is not our problem. Our problems exist within the institutionalization Orthodox Judaism, in our families, in our education system, and pretty much throughout all the areas of Jewish life. Our efforts must be focused on fixing those problems. Placing our energies into banning, or blocking, or demonizing the Internet is is just doing the exact same thing Paul Miller did when he took that a year awfully Internet. Now that he is back and he has told us what it is like, I am pretty sure that we can safely say that banning the Internet is not the right way to solve our problems. Problems don&#8217;t disappear when the Internet disappears.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7033" alt="library-books" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books-298x300.jpg" width="298" height="300" /></a>There are several dozen prohibitions in the Torah that relate to idol worship. Writing in the 12th century, Maimonides stridently warns against studying the texts of idolatry or even learning about idol worship. (Hilchos Avodas Kochavim 2:2)</p>
<p>The argument against interfacing with idol worship is that the human mind is drawn towards the things that one studies. One is not always in perfect control of what one thinks and what one wants. So even if one is studying for the sake of satisfying curiosity, or even learning to rebut, one may be drawn toward idol worship. Maimonides extends this law to include heresy as well.</p>
<p>This is all kinds of depressing. Under this view, it can be extremely dangerous to study anything one does not already believe because whatever one studies for whatever reason can have a very negative influence. While it might be interesting to debate or dispute this assumption, I think there is a great positive lesson to be learned as well.<span id="more-7032"></span></p>
<p>If we are drawn toward the &#8220;wrong&#8221; things by studying them, we can also be drawn to the &#8220;right&#8221; things by studying them. If we want to be more drawn to our Judaism, we can jumpstart ourselves by studying Torah. It doesn&#8217;t have to be anything specific, it can be anything. I think a lot of people study things that they don&#8217;t enjoy and that causes them to want to study less. We would be wise to broaden the scope of what we study as a collective unit and give more people more opportunities to find things they enjoy studying. One doesn&#8217;t have to study the familiar texts. Study whatever Jewish texts you want. It seems that when one learns about anything, one is drawn toward that thing. We want to be more drawn to our Judaism. Let&#8217;s study.</p>
<p>Studying Torah is valuable for so many reasons. This just seems like another side benefit.</p>
<p>This is the most important thing we can do to keep ourselves, children, and communities on the path of Judaism. Study. We are the People of the Book and it is our duty to study and know the Book. Judaism requires us to be knowledgeable. But learning about Judaism seems like good advice anyway, even for people who are already quite observant. We should study things that we want to be drawn toward. Study Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1776.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7022" alt="1776" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1776-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>Lag B&#8217;Omer is on Sunday. This means the entire State of Israel (and many Jewish areas around the world) will be lit with bonfires, the city of Safed and Meron will host thousands of pilgrims to the grave of R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai, schools will take their students on outings, some people will watch great rabbis shoot a bow and arrow, young boys will get their first haircuts, charity will be given for holy water, and songs will be sung to remember R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai. This is all aside from all proliferation of bogus Lag B&#8217;Omer segulos that bombard us.</p>
<p>These are all Lag B&#8217;Omer traditions that are a part of our culture.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all great fun and all, and I don&#8217;t mean to rain on anyone&#8217;s parade (or bonfire) but we do need to question whether these activities are appropriate.<span id="more-7021"></span></p>
<p>Lag B&#8217;Omer is a very recent holiday. It&#8217;s not in the Mishna, Talmud, Geonim, Rishonim, Shulchan Aruch, or Rema. Because it is not found in our traditional books and sources, it is worth thinking about the contemporary celebrations of Lag B&#8217;Omer in the broad context of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>If I would tell you that there is a holiday where people make a pilgrimage to a tomb, light bonfires, dance around the fires, give money for holy water, sing songs about a great man, and make a religious ceremony out of a haircut, would you think that sounded like a traditional Jewish holiday? It wouldn&#8217;t to me. To me it sounds a bit pagan.</p>
<p>And it makes sense that it doesn&#8217;t sound familiar to the Jewish ear, because it is a new holiday which was certainly influenced by outside factors.</p>
<p>There are many halachic concerns regarding some of these practices. Just because they are done, does not mean they are right. Certainly it is possible to participate in all the Lag B&#8217;Omer fun and excitement without violating halacha. But it is not an easy task. If anyone starts to think that R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai is praying on their behalf, that could be idol worship. Or if someone venerates R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai as a spiritual power, that could be idol worship. If the haircuts at three years old at a tomb are borrowed from idol worship, it&#8217;s a problem. If giving money for holy water is a borrowed from Christianity, it&#8217;s a problem. Relying on charms and magic is a problem.</p>
<p>So you see, it&#8217;s not so simple to celebrate the new holiday of Lag B&#8217;Omer.</p>
<p>But the most important question we have to ask ourselves is why are we celebrating Lag B&#8217;Omer in this manner? How did this happen? How did it come to be that a holiday which was invented in the last few hundreds years has become a very religiously significant event? So much so that people will read this post and wonder if I am orthodox? How did this happen?</p>
<p>And one last question: Should R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai really be our biggest rabbinic hero? See this post on DovBear for more that: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/05/mitzvoth-not-magic-or-what-about-r.html">Mitzvoth not magic: Or what about R. Yehuda?</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, but I don&#8217;t think we will like the answer if we ever find out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Quill_Pen_graphic_for_web_t670.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7003" alt="Quill_Pen_graphic_for_web_t670" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Quill_Pen_graphic_for_web_t670-300x188.jpg" width="300" height="188" /></a>The Yated published its first edition since last week&#8217;s hit job on R&#8217; Gil Student and R&#8217; Harry Maryles. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/04/19/the-difference-between-hirhurim-and-the-yated-a-defense-of-r-gil-student/">The Difference Between Hirhurim and the Yated: A Defense of R’ Gil Student</a>) I am positive that they were barraged with letters to the editor. Some of them were sent to me so I know for certain that they were written.</p>
<p>They published one letter to the editor. It was from R&#8217; Gil Student. That&#8217;s it. His letter was respectful and polite. He also asked for an apology. Then they published a rebuttal from Avrohom Birnbaum who wrote the original article. In his rebuttal Birnbaum demonstrates an incredible ability to be obtuse. He doesn&#8217;t understand why his article was so wrong and doubles down on his unwarranted criticism.</p>
<p>A link to the letters is at the bottom of this post. Don&#8217;t miss the letter from Mrs. Herzog on a completely different topic.</p>
<p>The Yated should have published some more letters supporting R&#8217; Gil and R&#8217; Harry. They did not. So we take to the Internet where we are free to publish whatever we please.</p>
<p>I present a letter to the editor written by <strong>Simcha Schonfeld</strong> who has been published in the letters to the editor section of the Yated several times in the past.</p>
<p><span id="more-7002"></span><br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>An article penned by Avrohom Birnbaum appeared in last week&#8217;s edition that troubled me most deeply. In his piece entitled &#8220;The Broyde Affair and the Media Double Standard&#8221;, Mr. Birnbaum attacked Rabbi Gil Student and his blog Hirhurim for a manufactured series of misdeeds that are more the products of Mr. Birnbaum&#8217;s imagination than they are based in any objective reality. Birnbaum began his attempt at character assassination by accusing Rabbi Student and his website of being &#8220;controversial&#8221; and guilty of &#8220;chareidi smashing&#8221; though in a departure from good and accepted journalistic practices, he offered no evidence to support such incredible accusations. In fact, Rabbi Student is a respected and gentle talmud chacham whose entire essence lacks even a single cell of disrespect for any torah authority, regardless of the hat they wear &#8211; including those who wear black ones, like Rabbi Student himself. He has often taken other bloggers to task for doing exactly what Mr. Birnbaum accused him of. What&#8217;s more, Hihurim (<a href="http://torahmusings.com/">TorahMusings.com</a>) is a <em>chashuv makom torah</em>, an oasis of <em>halacha</em> and <em>machshava</em> on the web that has actually spawned seforim comprised entirely of posts appearing there. One such sefer was given to me as a gift by my (dare I say Chareidi) father. Since Mr. Birnbaum elected to offer no basis for the serious accusations he made, I invite your readers to view the website itself and reach their own conclusions.</p>
<p>I was further puzzled by level of vitriol that Birnbaum used in attacking Rabbi Student for having the perceived gall to decline to answer some of the Yated&#8217;s questions. I do not know who asked the six questions referenced in the piece and am unfamiliar with that individual&#8217;s educational background and journalistic training; however, I could only assume that his/her mentors would have been dissatisfied with the profoundly unprofessional, unnecessarily provocative and outright childish manner in which Rabbi Student was challenged. The questions that Rabbi Student declined to offer comments on included such crass phraseology as accusing Rabbi Student of being a &#8220;mouthpiece&#8221; of &#8220;an outright liar and an ethically tainted individual&#8221; and asked, rhetorically, whether Rabbi Student believed he owed an &#8220;apology&#8221; to his readership. Regardless of what one may think of Michael Broyde, there is a way to communicate in life and there are standards of professionalism in journalism. Those were not adhered to by the author of these intentionally loaded questions that conveyed clear hostility and disrespect more than any earnest desire to know. In response to the Yated&#8217;s adolescent style of questioning, Rabbi Student appropriately took the high road and offered no response at all. Sadly, as Mr. Birnbaum&#8217;s article demonstrates, the high road is all too often the road less traveled.</p>
