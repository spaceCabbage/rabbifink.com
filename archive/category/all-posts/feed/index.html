				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Israel, a haredi woman named Ruth Colian is asking that the Israeli government stop funding haredi political parties because they discriminate against women. The haredi parties will not place a woman on their ballots, yet they are receiving money from the government. Colian argues that the government is sponsoring gender discrimination by supporting the patriarchal system of haredi Judaism in politics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good argument and I hope she wins. But that&#8217;s not the issue here.<span id="more-7733"></span></p>
<p>The real issue is that Colian is running as a haredi woman for political office. She won&#8217;t run on a secular list because she says she is haredi. She wants to break the glass ceiling in the haredi community. I wish her luck because it won&#8217;t be easy. In the past, people who tried to change haredi norms were either pushed out or left on their own accord. It&#8217;s an uncomfortable place to be a revolutionary but maybe Colian will be the one.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7735" alt="feminism2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/feminism2-510x600.jpg" /></p>
<p>If she is successful, it will mean yet another avenue that haredi women can achieve the same level of acclaim and success as men. Leaving the rabbinate as one of the few places haredi women cannot. That might prove to be a difficult position to maintain.</p>
<p>Corian is a true haredi feminist. She is haredi and she is vying for equal opportunities for women. This is the basic premise of feminism. It comes in many flavors and textures, but at the heart of all of these feminist movements is a sense that men and women should have equal opportunities and that men should not dictate the role that women must play in society. One can see how feminism and haredi life seem incompatible. While it&#8217;s true that many, if not most, haredi women choose to play the dignified and refined role of mother, wife, and homemaker on the sidelines of religious and communal life, there are many women who would prefer to have a choice to play a more public role in religious and communal life. That is what the haredi feminists want.</p>
<p>When juxtaposed with a trailer for an upcoming documentary on the hasidic community of Brooklyn called Uniforms: The Hasidic #Community, Corian&#8217;s struggle seems even more poignant. The documentary was produced by a self proclaimed non-traditional Jewish woman. She offers a peek into the softer, more spiritual side of Hasidic Judaism. It&#8217;s a noble attempt to show good people living good lives. The public has a negative perception of Hasidic Judaism and this documentary could go a long way to bridging that divide.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the extremely problematic conflation of different hasidic groups in the movie, illustrated by the visuals of chasidim in shtreimels and double head coverings for the women, while hip Chabad people talk about their more liberal way of life, there was a line in the trailer that requires attention.</p>
<p>A woman, who almost certainly is Chabad as betrayed by her perfectly unaccented English, proclaims: <em>&#8220;Jewish [sic] women, we&#8217;re kind of the biggest feminist women out there. Judaism creates space for women to tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I think that if a woman wants to &#8220;tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children&#8221; she should have that opportunity. I am all for traditional values for women that want those values in their lives. It&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s one of the secrets to Orthodox Judaism. In fact, I think it&#8217;s a problem that so many husbands and fathers are studying all day while their wives are leaving the home to support their husbands and babies are being dropped off at day care. I believe the traditional home is a great ideal and bearing children is a wonderful and powerful role to play in this world.</p>
<p>However, it is decidedly not feminist. It can be feminist to choose that life. But if everyone is doing it, or is expected to do it, it does not fit any accepted meaning of the word. You can&#8217;t unilaterally change the entire meaning of the word feminist and apply it to haredi Judaism. It doesn&#8217;t pass the laugh test, forget the smell test.</p>
<p>And why is feminism an ideal for this haredi woman? Why is she trying to pretend that a world where women are not given every opportunity that men are given and they are expected to produce large families is feminist. It&#8217;s not feminist at all. Proudly so! Recently, I heard a prominent rabbi say that Jewish feminists were comparable to reform and conservative Judaism! Orthodox Judaism is not feminist. You need to be okay with that to be orthodox.</p>
<p>In Israel, Ruth Corian is dying for the opportunity to lead her community. She is a feminist. In Brooklyn the party line is apparently that being a mom is the most feminist thing one can do.</p>
<p>Again, I am not degrading moms. God forbid! I think it&#8217;s a great choice if one can and one wants to make it. But it&#8217;s not feminist if that is what is expected. But even more perplexing is why are you trying to call it feminist?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is an isolated incident. I&#8217;ve seen this more and more often. People are selling Orthodox Judaism as feminist. I&#8217;m a pretty liberal Orthodox Jew and I don&#8217;t see how anyone could interpret my religion as feminist.</p>
<p>Personally, it bothers me. I grapple with it. I struggle with the current inequality and I empathize with those orthodox Jewish women who want to play a more prominent public role. I wish Orthodox Judaism had more feminist opportunities. I do my best to accommodate feminism within tradition. But I don&#8217;t redefine the term to conform to my orthodox worldview. Words have meaning and that meaning must be respected.</p>
<p>It seems impossible, if not extremely unlikely, that orthodox Judaism will ever have equal opportunities for men and women. Maybe that&#8217;s okay. Not every religion or creed has to conform with every modern sensibility. But let&#8217;s at least be honest about it. And if we can, try to break as many glass ceilings that we can shatter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contemporary Orthodox Judaism has the benefit of access to thousands of Torah commentaries at the click of a button. This has resulted in dozens of books that cull from these sources providing a multifaceted view of the text of the Chumash. Previously, the popular Midrashim such as those found in Rashi or the Ramban were most well known and accepted as baseline interpretations. I think in the last 150 years or so we have seen greater exposure to the other midrashic interpretations because they are more accessible and more people are studying Torah.<span id="more-7729"></span></p>
<p>The result is that some commentaries grapple with competing opinions in the Midrashic literature. It&#8217;s en vogue to say that Midrashim do not need to reconcile. I agree. There is no reason for all Midrashim to jive. They are independent interpretations and I don&#8217;t believe it is necessary to take each interpretation as literal or historical fact. This approach has ancient roots and is not apologetics. Maimonides famously said that Midrashim that contradict observable fact are not to be taken literally.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7730" alt="download" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/download.jpeg" /></p>
<p>However, as far as I know (and I could be totally mistaken) he doesn&#8217;t say what to do about conflicting Midrashim. Of course it stands to reason that if Midrashim are not to be taken literally then they can conflict. But he doesn&#8217;t specifically tell us what to do about conflicting Midrashim.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, almost everyone else seemed to think conflicting Midrashim were a problem. Many commentaries try to reconcile Midrashim. It&#8217;s a staple of the Achronim. Apparently they thought that Midrashim <em>did</em> need to be reconciled.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah asks questions on Midrashic interpretations under the assumption that they must work together. For example, he asks how Ishmael could be a Tzadik as per Rashi when the verse says &#8220;<em>ba&#8217;asher hu sham</em>&#8221; and also have committed one of the three cardinal sins to get tossed out of the house of Abraham. The easy answer is that it&#8217;s not a question because Midrashim don&#8217;t have to reconcile. (Or maybe he did Teshuva.) But the Torah Temimah does not answer it that way. Instead he attempts to show that there were two competing theories in Chazal and there are two ways to learn the reason Ishmael was kicked out and the one that says he was a Tzadik argues on the one who says Ishmael committed a cardinal sin. They are forced to say he was actually not a Tzadik and they will interpret the verse &#8220;<em>ba&#8217;asher hu sham</em>&#8221; like Nachmanides (contrary to Rashi). He does this all the time.</p>
<p>It seems, that in the view of the Torah Temimah, it is preferable that Midrashim reconcile unless there is a valid competing view. So while Midrashim in direct conflict seems to be okay without explanation, one standalone Midrashic interpretation must conform to all other standalone Midrashim. If there is an existing explicit conflict then you can say that a standalone irreconcilable Midrash follows one of those two or three options.</p>
<p>In other words, if we have Midrash A about 1 and Midrash X about 2 they are expected to conform. If they cannot conform we look for Midrash Y about 2 and see if that will work for Midrash 1 about A. If even that won&#8217;t help then we can say Midrashim can conflict. But there is a clear preference for unity amongst Midrsahic interpretations. This is even more pronounced when the authors of a Midrash are bold faced names that are normally authoritative.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point here? The point is that while it may be convenient to simply answer that Midrashim can conflict, there is an authentic Jewish tradition that tries to reconcile Midrashim and we should first see if we can harmonize Midrashim before we simply dismiss any question on a Midrashic interpretation by saying that they can conflict without batting an eye.</p>
<p>Like most people, my views on this issue evolve and this was a bit of an epiphany for me. If it was always obvious to you, <em>ashrecha.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After dropping out of Mesechta Pesachim, my sincere apologies, we are back on track with Mesechta Shekalim. Video and audio posts of the Daf will resume on Sunday with the start of the new mesechta. I hope to stay on top of the Daf for another 6 years or so but no promises. It&#8217;s a sincere attempt, not a promise.</p>
<p>I appreciate the emails and messages asking me (sometimes almost demanding) that I do the Daf again. It means a lot to me that so many people are studying Torah with me. The entire purpose of my Daf Yomi class is to enable people to learn the Daf quickly (15 minutes or so) and it is gratifying to me that so many of you have taken up the Daf through my class.</p>
<p>My Daf Yomi site is at <a href="http://daf.finkorswim.com" target="_blank">daf.finkorswim.com</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are quite a few approaches that religious people take in their attitude toward atheists and atheism. Three different ideas have been pitched or implemented in various outlets over the last couple of weeks. Seeing as so many of my fellow Jews are atheists, closeted or otherwise, I think it&#8217;s a question that contemporary Judaism must address.<span id="more-7721"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7722" alt="photo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo-600x449.jpg" /></p>
<p>A billboard in New York&#8217;s Times Square proclaims: <em>&#8220;To all of our atheist friends: Thank God you’re wrong.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cute line. It&#8217;s not very substantive and I see no chance of winning any atheists over with this kind of advertisement. It&#8217;s cool that God is getting a shout-out in Times Square. It&#8217;s definitely a lone voice among a very vocal majority of very unGodly advertisements and signage in that spot. But that&#8217;s the only value I can see in it.</p>
<p>The New York Times contrasted this billboard with a recent statement by the Pope: <em>“Given – and this is the fundamental thing – that God’s mercy has no limits, if He is approached with a sincere and repentant heart the question for those who do not believe in God is to abide by their own conscience. There is sin, also for those who have no faith, in going against one’s conscience. Listening to it and abiding by it means making up one’s mind about what is good and evil.”</em></p>
<p>In other words, I think the Pope is saying that actions are far more important than faith. This is particularly ironic coming from Catholicism which has traditionally placed such a great emphasis on belief. In fact, part of the Orthodox Jewish meme on Christianity is that they are all about faith while we are about action. (I&#8217;m not saying this is true. I am saying that this is taught.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a much more inclusive message than the billboard&#8217;s message. I think the Pope&#8217;s message will have a greater influence on positive social behavior than a snarky anti-atheist sign. It also increases the chances that a non-believer would care to be involved in religion. The Pope wins this one.</p>
<p>Rabbi Avi Shafran also proposed some billboards to promote Orthodox Judaism. His ideas: <em>What if, instead of special offers and glitzy offerings, we simply proclaimed loud and clear – in billboards and web ads and social media – that being a Jew, like it or not, precious fellow Jew, means being Divinely charged, that it means shouldering, whether it is always comfortable or not, responsibility ? And that ignoring that mandate is a reckless wasting of an opportunity to live a meaningful life by doing G-d’s will? That each of us has a stark and urgent choice: either to regard our lives as the brief opportunities to access eternity they are, or to waste one’s days in the pursuit of stuff and fun and “rights”?</em></p>
<p>I think this sounds more like the Times Square billboards than the Pope. While advertising our message is a great idea, I fear that advertising a hard line message is not going to win too many people over. I think that the approach largely depends on one&#8217;s goal. For some, the goal is that people join your movement. That&#8217;s a good goal if your movement is a good one. It also depends on whether people are amenable to your movements rules and regulations.</p>
<p>But Orthodox Judaism is not for everyone. It can be. But right now it is not. So perhaps we would be better off with a goal echoed by the Pope. We should be promoting positive, universal values that will help improve the world. Help people who might need a boost find something in their Judaism or other religious heritage that can help them in their lives.</p>
<p>There is so much that religion can offer people, even if they are not believers. Giving them those opportunities trumps snarky billboards and heavy handed pressure, in my opinion. Yes, we need to get the message out there. The question is what is that message.</p>
<p>I think the message is that religion and in particular Judaism can be beneficial to people no matter what they believe.</p>

<p>Turns out, I made a big mistake and misremembered what the Torah Temimah said. It&#8217;s inexcusable and I regret not double checking what he actually says before I posted. <em>Chatasi.</em> So I wrote a second post correcting my error.</p>

<p>The Torah Temimah lists <em>Damesek</em> as one of many examples where the Torah uses a foreign language in the Torah. He says that the word is used as &#8220;domestic help&#8221; in &#8220;old languages&#8221; and is still used in French in this way.</p>
<p>In the comments, people wonder if this is a big deal. Maybe it&#8217;s not. It definitely shouldn&#8217;t be a big deal but I think it is a big deal. Here is why.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7714" alt="255337-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/255337-1-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p>There are some questions about the Bible that have traditional answers. But some of those traditional answers appear to be insufficient to Orthodox Jews in 5774. Sometimes the questions are better than the answers. One kind of answer that has been presented and rejected by traditionalists is that the Torah speaks in the language of man and may include anachronisms that made sense to the original intended audience in a way that our modern ears can&#8217;t relate.</p>
<p>The reason this approach is rejected is because it breaks some of the self imposed traditional frum rules of learning Torah. It&#8217;s considered too liberal or too reform-like to allow for non-eternal meanings to the Torah.</p>
<p>Two of the arguments used to bolster this claim are that the Torah was a closed book at Sinai and that the Torah cannot be influenced by factors external to the text itself. The commonly held position on the closing of the Bible is that everything was taught at Sinai. Opinions that allow for the final verses (and more) to have been added by later prophets from unimpeachable sources are shunned because they burst this bubble. Similarly, allowing for outside influence into the Torah implies that the Torah is somewhat subjective. For example, the famous statement of Maimonides that sacrifices were a concession to a people with pagan leanings is considered borderline problematic. The conventional wisdom is that if the Torah included sacrifices it must have been God&#8217;s &#8220;original intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Showing that the Torah is a book with external influence bolsters the claim of Maimonides and may allow for extending it to other ideas in the Torah. This is considered dangerous and out of bounds for &#8220;Torah True&#8221; Jews.</p>
<p>Whenever we have traditionally accepted sources that allow for outside influence we are showing that the contemporary reluctance to this kind of interpretation actually runs counter to tradition. The Torah Temimah had no problem listing several places in the Bible where the Torah borrows from other languages. This is a big deal.</p>
<p>Of the two options above, let&#8217;s call them &#8220;closed book&#8221; and &#8220;not completely closed book,&#8221; which fits better with this Torah Temimah? It&#8217;s clearly the &#8220;not completely closed book&#8221; option. In other words, we are reinforcing the idea that the Torah could have outside influences. Why would the Torah use a non-Bible word it its text? It certainly could have used a native word or invented a Biblical word. Why didn&#8217;t it? Isn&#8217;t the obvious answer that the Torah was speaking to an audience familiar with these words and thus it chose to use familiar language?</p>
<p>The implication of that answer is that the Torah considers its audience. It spoke in a way that people would expect it to speak. It&#8217;s an eternal book that was written under specific circumstances. Therefore we are able to extend this theory to answer questions we have with new non-traditional answers. The answers might be new, but the approach is not new. Of course we are not at liberty to change it or ignore its commands, God forbid. But we can understand many of its tenets, rules, and stories in this context.</p>
<p>This might shed light on the Creation Story and the Flood Story. Or not. But I think it should be an option on the table for Orthodox Jews.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was long assumed that fact checkers only served to correct erroneous information as a service to the public. However they were not thought to influence the truthfulness of politicians in general. In other words, it was assumed that politicians don&#8217;t lie less often because they are scared of being caught in a lie.</p>
<p>Today, the New York times reports on a study that shows that awareness of Politifact, a well known fact checking outfit, does in fact make a difference.</p>
<p><span id="more-7689"></span></p>
<p>In the study, over 1,000 politicians were sent letters by two professors. One group was reminded that Politifact was out there watching them and that lies would damage their career if the lies were exposed. The politicians sent return postcards acknowledging receipt of the letters. The second group were given a general statement telling them that the accuracy of their statements was being measured. A third group received no letters.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7690" alt="whistleblower" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/whistleblower-600x450.jpg" /></p>
<p>Significantly fewer politicians from group one made false statements than politicians from group two. Almost three times as many legislators from the second and third group made false statements. It seems that awareness of fact checking does indeed makes a difference.</p>
<p>Similarly, in our community there is a sense that bloggers are useless and just preaching to the choir. This might be true. But if the leadership is aware that they are being &#8220;fact checked&#8221; it seems that it will have an impact on policy and behavior. If so, there is a great benefit the J-Blogs are providing.</p>
<p>Fact checking leadership means asking tough questions. It can also mean exposing lies or untruths. Sometimes it means challenging conventional wisdom. Other times it means pointing out that a commonly held belief is not universally held in our tradition. There are many ways blogs fact check orthodox Judaism. It makes a difference.</p>
<p>Of course this requires leadership to be aware of the blogs. Some are. Some are not. But whistleblowers and dissenting opinions coming from the street are making a difference. Eventually, it will be impossible to continue to ignore their voice. But even if the issues raised are not specifically addressed, we can be sure that they are making a difference simply because they exist. People act differently when they know they are being watched and when errors are going to be exposed.</p>
<p>Facebook and Twitter have given even more people a strong voice. But blogs will always be an important form of discourse and communication. It is on blogs that ideas are more thoroughly discussed and analyzed. Blog are also beneficiaries of Google. Search any Jewish topic and you&#8217;ll find blogs that have written on the subject.</p>
<p>The voice of the J-Blogosphere can be confusing, annoying, angry, cynical, unpopular, and negative. But it also serves the very important purpose of fact checkers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while ago, I commented somewhere on Facebook (I think it was a Joshie Berger rant) that orthodox Jews don&#8217;t <em>really</em> believe that humans can&#8217;t live past 120 years old. Frum people know that humans can live past 120. So it&#8217;s not a challenge to orthodox Jewish faith that in recorded history, especially recently, humans have outpaced the 120 mark on several occasions.</p>
<p>I believe the popular source for the belief that 120 is the age limit for humans is a combination of this verse in Parshas Breishis <em>&#8220;And the LORD said: &#8216;My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh; therefore shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.&#8221;</em> (6:3) and the fact that Moses lived to 120 as well.<span id="more-7681"></span></p>
<p>However, Rashi quotes the midrashic interpretation that the verse as referring to the years that God waits before punishing mankind. The Ibn Ezra explicitly rejects the opinion that people cannot live past 120 years that is based on this verse as well.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the Torah Temimah does this and more. He quotes the Jerusalam Talmud in Nazir that asks how it&#8217;s possible for people to only live to 120 if Adam lived to almost 1000?! The Talmud answer that the verse is referring to decomposition. The bones of a person decompose after 120 years. (7:2)<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bones.pdf"><br />
</a><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7684" alt="A-previous-burial-was-pushed-out-of-the-way-to-make-way-for-this-womans-skeleton.-There-were-two-football-field-size-cemeteries-found-on-this-site-where-250-skeletons-were-found.-Mike-Hettwer-960x617" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/A-previous-burial-was-pushed-out-of-the-way-to-make-way-for-this-womans-skeleton.-There-were-two-football-field-size-cemeteries-found-on-this-site-where-250-skeletons-were-found.-Mike-Hettwer-960x617-600x385.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Torah Temimah notes that the Talmud is bothered by the plain fact that the verse is contradicted by people who lived longer than 120 years and even other Torah verses that describe longer lifetimes. So the Talmud answers that the verse is not to be taken literally and is instead referring to decomposition.</p>
<p>But this is of little help. The Torah Temimah correctly points out that there are sources in our tradition of bones that lasted longer than 120 post mortem like the bones of Joseph. He also cites secular experts who have found old bones of people known to have died more than 120 years prior to their discovery. By the way, decomposition takes between 10-75 years depending on soil conditions according to my research.</p>
<p>So the Torah Temimah is forced to say that the Talmud is making a general statement for which there are more exceptions that situations where the rule applies. It cannot even be talking about every bone in a person&#8217;s body because the Talmud talks about the bone in our spine that never decomposes and is the place from where we will regenerate in the times of the Messiah. Therefore, the Jerusalem Talmud must be speaking in vague terms and is not meant to be taken as a definitive, universal statement.</p>
<p>I find this Torah Temimah fascinating. Evidence from the Torah and science can disprove the idea that people drop dead if they reach 120. So we are easily able to dismiss that verse as literally true. But the solution suffers from the same flaws as the question. There are fossils that are millions of years old. And not just the bone that &#8220;doesn&#8217;t decompose.&#8221; There are many more skeletons that have completely decomposed. Even that bone from the spine that is not supposed to decompose decomposes. These are demonstrable facts.</p>
<p>So now we have two options. We can say that the Torah Temimah and his interpretation of the Talmud are correct and our eyes deceived us or we can say he erred. The interesting thing is that I think we can be certain which path the Torah Temimah would choose. He would choose the latter. That is how he arrived at his position in the first place!</p>
<p>There is nothing frummer about the first option. Especially when we are using it to &#8220;help&#8221; an authority that chose the second option time and time again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no different when we talk abuot Chazal. They also chose the second choice whenever they found out they made a mistake. It&#8217;s not frummer to choose option one to &#8220;help&#8221; Chazal when they themselves chose the second option in various places.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ami Magazine published an article by Sara Yocheved Rigler that would have many of our Geonim and Rishonim turning over in their graves. In a nutshell, the article describes strange phenomena such as fear of Nazi related imagery or fear of situations that might be similar to Holocaust experiences. The people experiencing these things are not able to explain why they have these fears.</p>
<p>According to the article, these are manifestations of reincarnated souls from the Holocaust. That is the only explanation given for these oddities (which are not very odd at all). In fact, the article goes so far as to suggest that non-Jews are also reincarnated with Jewish souls from the Holocaust and this is what draws them toward conversion. Of course this is problematic because those who believe in reincarnation and recycling of souls also believe that souls only transmigrate from Jew to Jew and non-Jews are given new souls with each birth. This is waved away by a rabbi quoted in the article who says if you wanted to be a non-Jew in a previous life you come back as a non-Jew.</p>
<p>I have three basic issues with this article.<span id="more-7676"></span></p>
<p>1. It is disingenuous because it uses anecdotes from people who do not necessarily agree with the article as support for the article&#8217;s ideas. For example, Rabbi Berel Wein is quoted at the beginning of the article. He related that the Ponevezher Rav once said to a group of young couples in Miami that their job was to repopulate the world with Jews in the aftermath of the Holocaust. That is a common Jewish sentiment from the mid-20th century. The problem is that it is being used as some sort of support for the idea that Jews born in America are reincarnations of people who perished in the Holocaust. He said nothing of the sort. He meant nothing of the sort. There is simply no reason to think he did.</p>
<p>Another similar example is using R&#8217; Lau&#8217;s recollection of the Holocaust. He famously said that experiencing the Holocaust as a child left him with three strong memories. Dogs, boots, and trains. This is somehow used as support for the idea that someone who is afraid of boots is reincarnated from someone who perished in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Neither of those stories has anything to do with reincarnation. But it gives the article &#8220;credence&#8221; to toss a few familiar names into the article to prove irrelevant, agreed upon points.</p>
<p>2. Stay away from the Holocaust. Trying to explain Holocaust deaths as <em>tikkun</em> and a way of cleansing a soul is offensive. We don&#8217;t know why people die. We don&#8217;t even know if there is always a reason that people die. To try to make death feel better because it&#8217;s part of a giant soul reincarnation cleansing plan is no better than saying they died because of their sins. It&#8217;s ugly.</p>
<p>But more importantly, it demonstrates that the real reason reincarnation is being discussed in this context is to make us feel better. We don&#8217;t understand death and destruction so we explain it with reincarnation. We don&#8217;t understand how millions could die for no reason so we explain it with reincarnation. We can&#8217;t explain a fear of showers or boots so it must be reincarnated souls from the Holocaust. There might be better answers to these questions. But the article does not explore them. Using the emotional appeal of the Holocaust to draw us into a reincarnation narrative is inappropriate.</p>
<p>3. Most importantly, reincarnation is a very controversial subject in Judaism. It&#8217;s not mentioned in Tanach. It&#8217;s not mentioned in the Talmud or Medrash. It&#8217;s rejected by most of the Geonim. It is rejected or ignored by many of the mainstream Rishonim. It serves no theological purpose other than to explain things that might be able to be explained in another way.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Gilgul-Ami.pdf"><br />
</a></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7678" alt="img-kickstartbusiness" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/img-kickstartbusiness.jpg" /></p>
<p>The article jumps right into reincarnation without a moment&#8217;s consideration of the very prominent Torah authority figures that reject reincarnation. This is at worst a lie and at best ignorance. But either way it is incomplete. Gilgul is not a necessary belief in orthodox Judaism. In fact, it might be worst to believe in it than not to believe in it. Why are we normalizing this kind of thing? Why are we discarding the valid opinions that don&#8217;t hold of gilgul? Why is it okay to just side with the Arizal on everything and forget about everyone else?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to make the complete case against gilgul here. But I will make a couple of points.</p>
<p>The Ancient Greeks believed in reincarnation. We did not. We knew their beliefs and we rejected them in the time of Chazal. It&#8217;s impossible to say that Jews did not talk about reincarnation because they just didn&#8217;t know that it could exist. It was known and it was not accepted. It began to be accepted by a select few Rishonim after being rejected by the two most prominent early Rishonim that discuss Hashkafa, Rambam and Rabbi Judah HaLevi. The one prominent Rishon who does mention gilgul is Ramban and he does so at the expense of an interpretation on the verse that is in Chazal. In other words, they had a different explanation for the verse. The interpretation of Ramban contradicts Chazal.</p>
<p>In the 15th and 16th century there was a renewed interest in this sort of thing. Dybbuks also became more popular in this period. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/21/book-review-between-worlds-dybbuks-exorcists-and-early-modern-judaism/">Between Worlds: Dybbuks, Exorcists, and Early Modern Judaism </a>) But it&#8217;s no fait accompli that gilguls and dybbuks are part of Judaism. We have no idea if it&#8217;s true and our early sources say that it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a positive development that these beliefs have gone mainstream. They are too easy to reject and cast aspersion on the more vital parts of Judaism. We don&#8217;t need this stuff in Judaism and it doesn&#8217;t improve our lives. Why are we so willing and eager to embrace it in our publications without question? This is my little protest. Don&#8217;t force these beliefs down our throats. It&#8217;s not integral to Judaism.</p>
<p><em>(Note: Reincarnation at the times of Messiah has nothing to do with this discussion.)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pew conducted a study of Jews in America and has released a comprehensive report based on its findings. Nearly 2800 religious Jewish people were interviewed and the results of those interviews make up the model for the results of the study. It&#8217;s difficult conduct a study like this and achieve meaningful results. I am not a statistician nor can I compare the sample sizes used in this study with others. To my untrained eye, it seems small.</p>
<p>There are many very interesting findings to discuss. I have three things I want to say about the study.</p>
<p>First, people will point to the staggering number of orthodox Jews who are no longer orthodox. That number is 52%. It seems impossible to believe. That means that over half of people raised orthodox are no longer orthodox. Think about the orthodox Jewish friends and family you know. Does it make sense to say that over half of them are no longer orthodox? I don&#8217;t think so.<span id="more-7664"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7665" alt="jew-chp3-3" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp3-3.png" />If you drill down a bit you notice a couple of things. For starters, I know many people who say they were raised orthodox because they went to a yeshiva or modern orthodox school even if they weren&#8217;t frum at home. I went to school with several people like that. Those people certainly skew the numbers. After all, the study relied on self identification. There was no process to classify people into categories other than to ask them.</p>
<p>But the real key here what the numbers are for young people being raised in contemporary orthodoxy. Those numbers are impressive. 83% of people raised as orthodox Jews under the age of 30 stay. This is a huge success. It&#8217;s also a number that correlates with anecdotal evidence. So the people who were raised orthodox and no longer are orthodox are mostly older people. What does this mean?</p>
<p>It means one of two things or perhaps a hybrid of two. [It doesn't mean that orthodox Jews leave the fold in their 30's and 40's at alarmingly high rates.] It could either mean that orthodoxy is much stronger today than it was 20 and 30 years ago. People get a better Jewish education, there is more insularity, and the shift to ultra orthodoxy which outnumbers modern orthodoxy by nearly 10:1 in this demographic is working to keep more orthodox Jews orthodox. Alternatively, it signifies a shift in who attends orthodox schools. In other words, 20-30 years ago it was far more likely for a family to send a child to an orthodox school and identify as orthodox even if they were not totally observant of halacha. There was more cross-pollination and there were fewer non-orthodox options. So you wind up with more people from previous generations identifying as being raised orthodox even though they weren&#8217;t truly orthodox through and through. This is rarer today because we are more insular and non-orthodox or unaffiliated Jews feel less comfortable in orthodox institutions. The truth is likely a combination of the two but the latter does concern me.</p>
<p>Also, very few middle aged and older people consider themselves ultra-orthodox. It&#8217;s a youth movement. Sure, some mellow out and switch affiliation. But it&#8217;s also a recent phenomena that is sweeping orthodoxy. It&#8217;s pretty compelling evidence that what is happening now for the under 40 orthodox Jew is different from what their parents and grandparents experienced. It&#8217;s a different kind of Judaism. The numbers bear it out.</p>
<p>Next, the non-orthodox denominations are falling apart. The numbers support the rumblings and rumors regarding the demise of Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism is dwindling as well. Some orthodox Jews like to cheer while these two denominations begin to disappear. Others view it as a sign that those Jews must be saved and brought into orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I think that it is important for Judaism that non-orthodox denominations are strong and vibrant. I think that orthodox Jews should be concerned and make efforts to help revive non-orthodox Judaism. This sounds controversial and heretical but it&#8217;s really not. Orthodox Judaism is not going to magically become the Judaism for the 89% of non-orthodox Jews. We can either wish them well and watch them disappear or we can try to keep them connected to their Jewish heritage. I think the latter choice is preferable. Now we can either keep them connected by &#8220;making them orthodox&#8221; as if that is even possible, or we can rely on strong non-orthodox denominations to keep them in the fold. I think the latter choice is preferable here too. It&#8217;s certainly the more likely option to achieve widespread success. While resources are precious in the orthodox community, I think strengthening the non-orthodox denominations is a worthy endeavor. They are also our brothers and sisters. If we value what we have, we should do whatever we can to help them stay somewhat connected to their Judaism. A little bit of a good thing is a whole lot better than nothing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7666" alt="jew-chp4-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp4-2-306x600.png" /></p>
<p>The last thing for now are the numbers on belief in God. 96% of ultra-orthodox Jews are <em>certain </em>that there is a God. Certain. That&#8217;s a very high number. I also wonder how they can all be so certain. The modern orthodox number is 77%. Also a very high number for certainty. 8% of ultra-orthodox Jews believe but are less certain and 19% of modern orthodox Jews fit that description. I think that both of those numbers are really higher. Most people don&#8217;t think about belief in God. They just do it. But the question wasn&#8217;t simply about belief. The question measured the certainty of the believer. I am skeptical that someone can be certain of something without being able to make a compelling argument in favor of that certainty. How many of us can make that argument? If we can&#8217;t, can we be certain? <em>(Stay tuned for an essay on this issue sometime soon.)</em></p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting numbers in this section are the numbers of people who &#8220;do not believe.&#8221; Here the number for ultra-orthodox is 1% while it is 3% for modern orthodox. Practicing Judaism under a state of disbelief s not an easy proposition. If one doesn&#8217;t think the mitzvos and traditions have Divine meaning then they are bound to become a huge burden. However, orthopraxy &#8211; practicing Judaism despite disbelief is a growing trend. I wonder what these numbers will look like in a few years. It&#8217;s possible that more people who do not believe in God will feel comfortable in orthodox Judaism and they will grow as a public group. But it&#8217;s also possible that a rise in those numbers will inspire a thorough vetting of all orthodox Jews which would force all orthoprax Jews into a closet or out of orthodox Judaism altogether.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other interesting numbers to discuss. (97% of ultra-orthodox Jews have all or mostly Jewish friends. That&#8217;s insularity! How about only 57% of orthodox Jews are Republicans? And the support for Israel numbers need addressing as well.) Perhaps I will revisit the study and more of its social commentary in a future post. For now, these are the three things that jumped out at me.</p>
<p><em>Note: The orthodox people surveyed were all from Brooklyn, Monsey, and Lakewood. I think this might be significant.</em> (EDIT: This is imprecise. Those were the oversampled counties. My apologies.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an interesting interpretation by the Torah Temimah where he uses scientific knowledge to explain a dispute in the Talmud.</p>
<p>The verse in Parshas Breishis states <em>&#8220;There went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.&#8221;</em> The Torah Temimah quotes the Babylonian Talmud in Mesechta Taanis 9B that records a dispute between R&#8217; Eliezer and R&#8217; Yehoshua regarding the source of rain.<span id="more-7655"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[Copied from Soncino] &#8220;R. Eliezer said: The whole world draws its water supply from the waters of the ocean, as it is said, But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole of the ground. Thereupon R. Joshua said to him: But are not the waters of the ocean salty? He replied: They are sweetened by the clouds. R. Joshua said: The whole world drinks from the upper waters, as it is said, And drinketh water as the rain of heaven cometh down. If so, what is the force of the verse, ‘But there went up a mist from the earth’? This teaches that the clouds grow in strength as they rise towards the firmament and then open their mouth as a flask and catch the rain water, as it is said, Which distill rain from His vapor, they are perforated like a sieve and they slowly distill waters on the ground.&#8221;<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/evaporation.pdf"><br />
</a><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7657" alt="water_cycle" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/water_cycle-600x307.png" /></p>
<p>The Torah Temimah explains what R&#8217; Eliezer means using (then) modern science. R&#8217; Yehoshua is correct. The waters of the oceans are salty and unfit for drinking. Therefore R&#8217; Yeshoshua concludes that rain water cannot come from the oceans. R&#8217; Eliezer understood that the reason the waters of the ocean must rise to the clouds and then return to the earth is to desalinize the ocean water. Only the water evaporates while the impurities like salt are left behind.</p>
<p>This can be demonstrated by boiling dirty water says the Torah Temimah. The droplets that form on the lip of the boiling pot are pure water no matter what the water in the pot looks like. Similarly, the salt and minerals in water on earth are removed when the water evaporates and are returned to earth via the clouds in the sky. That&#8217;s why R&#8217; Eliezer says the whole world draws water from the oceans. R&#8217; Yehoshua is confused because the ocean waters are salty. To which R&#8217; Eliezer replies that the waters are sweetened during the evaporation and cloud process just like the droplets on the lid of the pot boiling dirty water.</p>
<p>I read this and thought this was a pretty good explanation of R&#8217; Eliezer&#8217;s position. Unfortunately it leaves R&#8217; Yehoshua in a very vulnerable position. What are we to think happened after R&#8217; Eliezer explained evaporation to R&#8217; Yehoshua? Perhaps when presented with the scientific explanation he acquiesced to R&#8217; Eliezer. The Talmud assumes he did not because the subsequent discussion deals with R&#8217; Yehoshua&#8217;s position as equally viable to R&#8217; Eliezer&#8217;s.</p>
<p>More importantly, could R&#8217; Eliezer have known this scientific information? According to my brief Internet research, it seems that the basic principles of natural desalination were known to the Greeks. It&#8217;s possible that R&#8217; Eliezer adopted something he heard from them. Although I am unsure if they understood that evaporated seawater turned into clouds in the manner the Torah Temimah understands it. Of course, it is possible that R&#8217; Eliezer received this scientific information from God or some Divine Tradition. Personally, I do not subscribe to this view, but many others do.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the correct explanation R&#8217; Eliezer&#8217;s position. It is elegant in its explanation and pretty clever but it leaves us with other unanswered questions. Either way, kudos to the Torah Temimah for using his secular knowledge in his commentary on the Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight we begin our Sukkos celebration. Of all the Jewish holidays, Sukkos is the most anachronistic. It is a harvest festival, it was marked by sacrifices on behalf of the Nations of the World, the highlight of the holiday was a libation ceremony in the Temple, we still sit in huts that resemble huts people actually used to used, and we still wave four particularly Middle Eastern species of vegetation. Not to mention the very recent innovation of Simchas Torah.<span id="more-7651"></span></p>
<p>When one looks for divrei Torah on the holiday it&#8217;s slim pickings. There is no Hagaddah. There is no special prayer book. There is no magnificent event or overt miracle that is being celebrated either. Rabbis inevitably talk about Hakhel, the unity represented by the Four Species, Koheles, or the usual metaphors associated with the Sukkah. It&#8217;s not very fertile ground.</p>
<p>So what are we to make of Sukkos today?<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7652" alt="sukkot1_1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sukkot1_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>I think Sukkos speaks to the perpetuity of Judaism despite social and historical change. Our circumstances change, but we keep plugging away. Sukkos today feels different than it felt to our ancestors. That does not matter at all. Their huts were real huts. Our Sukkahs are elaborate and quite comfortable. Their Four Species were rare and only some people had nice sets. We all have beautiful sets.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve taken a harvest holiday and turned it into a culmination of the High Holidays. We have managed to make Sukkos a day that focuses on more elevated concepts but the integrity of the holiday remains intact. We used to call it <em>Zman Simchaseinu</em> because of our bountiful harvest. Now we call it <em>Zman Simchaseinu</em> because we feel redeemed following our repentance of the High Holidays. Things change but they stay the same.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Sukkos is a model of how Judaism adapts without compromise. We do everything the Torah asks us to do as best as we can do it but it has as very different flavor. Yet, Sukkos persists and prospers. It&#8217;s a beautiful holiday full of spiritual moments, family time, and meaningful rituals.</p>
<p>I wish you all a beautiful holiday. People say <em>Chag Kasher V&#8217;Sameach </em>on Pesach. It&#8217;s equally appropriate on Sukkos. We need our Sukkah and <em>Arba Minim</em> to be kosher and the holiday requires us to be joyful. So I say <em>Chag Kasher V&#8217;Sameach</em> to you. See you after the holiday.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A viral-ish video (almost 3k Likes) released before Yom Kippur poked fun at the rabbi&#8217;s sermon. The video featured puppets teaching the viewer how to write a High Holiday sermon. They said to start with a joke (see here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/09/15/why-do-rabbis-make-jokes-at-serious-times/" target="_blank">Why Do Rabbis Make Jokes at Serious Times?</a>), then tell a story, then make your point, but keep it short and interesting, unless the audience wants to sleep longer, har har har. It&#8217;s classic lowbrow sarcastic humor.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the joke was &#8220;funny&#8221; because rabbi&#8217;s speeches are predictable and formulaic. Further, this is seen as a very bad thing because things that are predictable, especially rabbi&#8217;s speeches, are no good.<span id="more-7644"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7646" alt="Screen Shot 2013-09-16 at 10.23.19 PM" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-16-at-10.23.19-PM-600x501.png" /></p>
<p>People thought the video was funny. I didn&#8217;t. But I actually have a problem with the concept of the video.</p>
<p>The underlying assumption behind the joke is that speeches should not be formulaic and that rabbis should not follow a script. I think both of these assumptions are wrong.</p>
<p>Things that are formulaic can be amazing. Baseball is formulaic. Pitch, hit, catch, throw. Political speeches are formulaic. Hit the talking points, wait for applause, repeat. Movies and TV shows are formulaic. Law and Order is as formulaic as can possibly be. A good meal has an appetizer, main, a salad, and a side dish. Predictable. But delicious. Formulas can be wildly successful. Just because something has a formula hardly means that it&#8217;s not impressive or worthwhile. Some of the most successful things in our world are formulaic. Ted Talks are incredibly formulaic. And incredibly popular. It&#8217;s pedantic and petty to harp on the formula of the rabbinic sermon. It&#8217;s not a valid criticism.</p>
<p>The second assumption is also wrong. That is, rabbis are usually decent teachers and orators. But to be those things rabbis should follow a script. Rabbis are teachers not entertainers. We don&#8217;t want baseball players to juggle chainsaws and we don&#8217;t want politicians to tap dance. Why would anyone expect rabbis to do anything other than teach and lead their congregations? Why should rabbis be expected to become entertainers?</p>
<p>Sure, rabbis should attempt to spice up their talks and not be stiff or boring. But the video implies that because rabbis use a basic formula for their sermons they should be mocked. They shouldn&#8217;t. Rabbis must be creative within the bounds of the expected formula but that&#8217;s it. What do they expect? A variety show starring the rabbi? Improv? Ludicrous.</p>
<p>Spontaneity and quirkiness have their place but a sermon is neither the time nor place for either of those. Perhaps our society overvalues surprising and thinking different. Sometimes we need to not think different and certainly not to mock thinking &#8220;the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using a video to make fun of the traditional rabbinic sermon just before the High Holidays was not only in bad taste, but it only served to subvert the important role that rabbis play this time of year. It was a poor choice to produce the video and an even poorer choice to release it just before the High Holidays.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sermon formula is not going to change. Nor should it. Different rabbis will have varying levels of success at speaking from the pulpit but it will almost always be within the same framework. This video only undermines rabbis without making a case for how rabbis could even do it any differently. Rabbis are not going to sing their sermon like Operaman sings the news. Rabbis are not going to mime their sermons. Rabbis are not going to direct a three part play. They are going to speak and they are going to use common speaking techniques to get their point across. They are going to make jokes and tell stories to bolster the attention of the audience. That&#8217;s the formula. Making fun of it is just dumb.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my most precious memories are the many years we sat in our family Sukkah with my grandparents as our guests. My grandmother still joins my parents for Sukkos sometimes. But my grandfather passed away almost 11 years ago ,yet his presence in my life is constant.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible for me to think about Sukkos without thinking of my grandfather singing &#8220;A Sukkeleh.&#8221; Even as I type these words I feel a swell of emotion and tears invade my eyes. It meant that much to us. I might not have appreciated it enough as a child, but I do now.<span id="more-7640"></span></p>
<p>With some Internet elbow grease I was able to get a digital copy of the song and after a couple of hours of work I put this video together. It might be nothing special or have little meaning to you but the song means a lot to me. My grandfather would have loved this. I don&#8217;t understand Yiddish so I had to find a translation of the words online. I used R&#8217; Shafran&#8217;s version as seen on <a href="http://www.torah.org/features/holydays/stillstands.html" target="_blank">Torah.org</a>  (see his article too) with a couple of tiny adjustments:<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7642" alt="tri_55474_1999-92" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tri_55474_1999-92.jpg" /></p>
<p>A sukkaleh, so small<br />
Wooden planks for each wall<br />
Lovingly I stood them upright<br />
I laid thatch as a ceiling<br />
And now, filled with deep feeling<br />
I sit in my sukkaleh at night.</p>
<p>A cold wind attacks,<br />
Blowing through the cracks<br />
The candles, they flicker and yearn<br />
It&#8217;s so strange a thing<br />
That as the Kiddush I sing<br />
The flames, calmed, now quietly burn.</p>
<p>In comes my daughter<br />
Bearing hot food and water<br />
Worry on her face like a pall<br />
She just stands there shaking<br />
And her voice nearly breaking<br />
Says &#8220;Tattenyu, the sukkah&#8217;s going to fall!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear daughter, don&#8217;t fret<br />
It hasn&#8217;t fallen yet<br />
The sukkah&#8217;s fine, banish your fright<br />
There have been many such fears<br />
For nigh two thousand years<br />
Yet the sukkeleh&#8217;s still standing upright.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jews are funny. I mean that in two ways. Jews make good jokes and we also do things that are funny sometimes. And by funny things, I mean odd.</p>
<p>My impression is that preachers are pretty serious when they speak from the pulpit. I think that the same could be said for imams. But for some reason, rabbis are always telling jokes.<span id="more-7635"></span></p>
<p>I resisted it for years. But it&#8217;s almost expected that rabbis will tell rabbi jokes from the pulpit. So I have been doing a little bit more humor once in a while and generally the feedback has been positive. I find this incredibly strange.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7636" alt="lmao-3" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lmao-3-600x449.jpg" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s even more strange when the jokes come at our holiest times of the year.</p>
<p>This year I had 175 people sitting in silence and reverence following a solemn Kol Nidre service. I opened my remarks with a joke. I felt so uncomfortable. But it seemed to me that no one else felt uncomfortable at all. They loved it.</p>
<p>I did the same thing before Neilah. The inspirational talk began with a joke. It worked. People listened. People complimented me. Believe me, I get complaints all the time. No one complained about the jokes.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t get it. I can&#8217;t even imagine a Catholic Priest making a joke during their service. I can&#8217;t imagine a politician speaking at a serious event and cracking a joke. I&#8217;d wager that jokes would not be acceptable in yeshivos either. Most serious yeshivish and chasidish places would not be cool with jokes during a serious drasha.</p>
<p>For some reason in more liberal orthodox shuls and the Conservative and Reform synagogues, jokes are expected. It feels inappropriate to me and I felt a bit hypocritical cracking a couple jokes but it seems to be expected and certainly acceptable. So I conformed and it was successful. But I felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know that I have any particular insight or explanation for this phenomenon. I guess it could be seen as a defense mechanism against the seriousness of the day. Though I am not sure why we need it and others do not. It might be because we don&#8217;t take things as seriously as other groups. I hope that&#8217;s not the reason. Is it because without humor people would not pay attention? That would be very sad.</p>
<p>Jewish humor developed as a way of coping with oppression. Maybe it&#8217;s just so much a part of our collective psyche that we can&#8217;t shake it. I don&#8217;t have the answer. But I just had to get this off my chest.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the very least, Yom Kippur gives us a reason to put our lives on pause and evaluate how we are doing. Inevitably we&#8217;ve hurt some people along the way. Yom Kippur reminds us to make amends with those people who have been harmed by our insensitivity or malice. It&#8217;s obviously better to apologize and make peace than it is to allow the pain to fester and infect us long term.<span id="more-7626"></span></p>
<p>I am not a fan of digital requests for for forgiveness. They are impersonal and make it seem like one is trying to take a shortcut rather than the heartfelt apology that is deserved.<img class="alignright  wp-image-7627" alt="forgiveness-healing-heart" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/forgiveness-healing-heart-600x552.jpeg" width="420" height="386" /></p>
<p>However I do think that I need to make a digital request for forgiveness as well offer as an e-apology. Many people who read this blog or my thoughts on other digital platforms only know me through this medium. I don&#8217;t even know who many of you are. In fact the people who are probably most offended or hurt by things I have said are people that don&#8217;t even comment or &#8220;Like&#8221; posts on Facebook. They read, they get upset, and they are silent. Sometimes I get irate emails. I get it. I do appreciate the chance to have a dialogue. It is far better than when people just stay angry without seeking an explanation.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that I know for certain that I have hurt people by the things I have written. For that I sincerely apologize. I don&#8217;t intend to hurt anyone and I regret that anyone was insulted or incensed by what I have written.</p>
<p>I am sorry for anything and everything that made you upset or made you feel bad about something. I know it happens and I am truly sorry.</p>
<p>I beg your forgiveness. Let&#8217;s go into Yom Kippur with a clean slate. All of us deserve the opportunity to pass through judgment by the Almighty free of the shackles interpersonal disputes place on us. We enter Yom Kippur with unity and one love.</p>
<p>As for all of you readers who may think you need to ask me forgiveness, you don&#8217;t. No one does. I don&#8217;t bear any grudges. I don&#8217;t take offense to anything you&#8217;ve written or said about me. I probably deserved it anyway. And even if I didn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s cool. Don&#8217;t worry.</p>
<p>I wish everyone a beautiful Yom Kippur. My favorite day of the year at Pacific Jewish Center is Yom Kippur. If you&#8217;d like to find out why, I invite you to join us either this year or sometime in the future. Wherever you are, I hope the day lives up to its lofty potential for you.</p>
<p><em>May we all be inscribed in the Book of Life.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another Yom Kippur is upon us. I remember talking with my 10th grade rebbe R&#8217; Kalman Weinreb outside the High School Beis Medrash on Erev Yom Kippur 5757. I was complaining about how hard the fast was for me. I suggested that it would be easier to pray and repent if I could just eat and drink a little. Not a lot, just a little. He empathized with my 15 year old sensibilities but explained to me how the complete immersion in spiritual pursuits requires complete immersion not almost complete immersion. He said it would be worth it. All good things are worth the difficult path we must take to arrive at our desired destination. R&#8217; Kalman was about to wrap up our conversation and then he looked at me with a gleam in his eye and told me that the fast gets easier every year. That was it. He walked away.<span id="more-7622"></span></p>
<p>My 15 year old self thought it was great news that the fast was going to get easier every year. Something to look forward to.<img class="alignright  wp-image-7623" alt="Kol_nidre_in_the_machzor_of_Worms" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Kol_nidre_in_the_machzor_of_Worms-508x600.jpg" width="305" height="360" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s true. The fast does get easier every year. This is my sixth Yom Kippur in an official capacity at Pacific Jewish Center. The first year I led the services for Kol Nidre, Maariv, and Neilah. I also spoke 4 times. I thought that I could not possibly do any more. Four years ago I started doing Mussaf as well. Indeed, it does get easier every year.</p>
<p>My 32 year old self does not agree with my 15 year old self. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good that the fast gets easier every year. The easier the fast becomes, the harder it is to truly experience the dread and discomfort that help make the day so powerful. I am not suggesting that we make it extra hard on ourselves. We take the day as it comes. But I think something is lost as we grow older. Our idealism may fade a bit. Our imagination is a little less active. Our dreams are not quite as vivid. We don&#8217;t feel things the way we did when we were younger. That&#8217;s why it gets easier.</p>
<p>While that may make surviving Yom Kippur less of a challenge, it can make living the day more challenging. It&#8217;s a new challenge every year. The hardest part of the challenge is being aware that it is there. I&#8217;ve only recently realized that this is something I need to work on for my own Yom Kippur experience.</p>
<p>The challenge is different. But we are certainly up to the challenge. Instead of struggling to pray while we feel ragged and tired we must struggle to feel ragged and tired as we breeze through the prayers.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The goal of Yom Kippur is not to get through the day. Rather the goal is for the day of Yom Kippur to go through us.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Its unique blend of spirituality should be coursing through our veins by the end of the day. After all, it&#8217;s the only thing we&#8217;ve put into ourselves for 25 hours.</p>
<p>If we succeed, and I am confident we will, we will realize the full magnitude of the gains to had on Yom Kippur no matter where we are in life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, The Atlantic ran an article written by the loving wife of a victim of childhood sexual abuse. The article is difficult to read yet doubly rewarding. First, the appreciation for the challenges abuse victims encounter and how they affect those who love them and second, the very sweet end of the article nearly outweighs the darkness of the rest of the article.</p>
<p>I have often (naively) said that if the <em>gedolim </em>would really understand the way abuse affects its victims, it they would really comprehend the trauma and horrors of abuse they would not hesitate to report abuse to the police.<span id="more-7615"></span> I&#8217;ve been told that the <em>gedolim </em>have been made aware of the severity of abuse and to no avail. This article would be part of that presentation that I naively think would change their minds on abuse. In a very direct and practical way, this article demonstrates just how deeply the victim of abuse feels their pain. Further, it illustrates how far reaching the trauma of abuse can be. It affects so many people beyond the initial victim.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7616" alt="discriminacion-mayorias-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/discriminacion-mayorias-2-600x424.jpg" /><br />
For that reason alone I recommend reading the article.</p>
<p>But there is so much more. In a large portion of the orthodox Jewish world, young men and women meet upon the approval of their parents. Mothers and fathers vet possible date prospects for their children. They rarely know these prospective mates personally. Rather, resumes are distributed and phone calls are placed to common friends and beyond. Parents are often overwhelmed with suggestions. It&#8217;s easy enough to eliminate the damaged goods before even embarking on a thorough investigation.But unfortunately there is a negative consequence to this kind of education in the orthodox Jewish community. Because victims of abuse are dealing with so much in their lives, they can be stigmatized and shunned as potential spouses.</p>
<p>Divorced parents? No thanks. Brother is no longer frum? No thanks. Sister didn&#8217;t go to seminary? No thanks. He&#8217;s in college? No way. She&#8217;s in law school? No thanks. Baal Teshuva? No thanks. At risk teen who figured things out at around 20 years old? No thanks.</p>
<p>Superficial details that have almost zero value in determining the true nature of the prospect can eliminate the prospect from contention very early on in the process. This results in a haves and have nots environment.</p>
<p>Organic dating avoids this issue. Boys meets girl, they get on well, they get to know each other, the develop feelings for one another, and then the superficial details emerge. By that time, very few sane people would toss out a relationship because his parents are divorced or she has a brother who is not frum. The relationship is more important than those petty details.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic dating has its own set of problems that the shidduch system can help avoid. I am not arguing in favor or against shidduch dating in this post. It&#8217;s just the reality of the shidduch scene that this is what happens.</p>
<p>According to my anecdotal, non-scientific research and basic reasoning skills, one of the greatest fears that frum abuse victims have is that they will be branded as damaged goods and find themselves at the bottom of the shidduch Totem pole. It is a legitimate fear. It&#8217;s stupid, but it is probably what would to happen. If parents hear a potential shidduch candidate was abused it makes sense within the misplaced priorities and confines of the shidduch system that they would just eliminate that person from consideration immediately.</p>
<p>By contrast, the first thing you learn about someone after meeting them is usually not whether they were abused. Obviously. In a good relationship, eventually it is likely to be disclosed and discovered and most probably dealt with together. So the abuse issue only arises once there is a couple with an existing relationship. If the abuse creates an unhealthy environment for a relationship that might doom the couple. But the information alone does not torpedo the relationship like it can within the shidduch system.</p>
<p>Thus, as much as we need to educate ourselves and our communities about the horrors of abuse, we also need to be careful not to allow ourselves to think that abuse victims are damaged goods who should be placed on the bottom of the deck when it comes to shidduchim. It&#8217;s a very difficult and narrow path to navigate but it is a necessary one. One solution to this problem might be jettisoning the shidduch system. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen. Instead, I think we will need to make a conscious effort to walk this tightrope. Let victims know that we empathize with their pain and their struggles. But we also are careful to make sure that victims know that we believe in them and in their ability to lead proud, confident, and successful lives. We all have challenges in life. Victims of abuse may have struggles that are more public than others, but we all have our struggles and no one group should have their struggles written off as inferior or that their struggles should automatically disqualify them from living orthodox Jewish life at its fullest.</p>
<p>For that matter, none of the superficial shidduch disqualifications make any sense. Let&#8217;s do away with all of them. But I think the abuse issue needs attention first because of how far behind we are in handling abuse and because suffering in silence compounds the trauma of abuse.</p>
<p>Please read the article and let&#8217;s start working together on the healing process, both individual and communal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most prominent themes of the High Holidays is our relationship with God as expressed by <em>Avinu Malkeinu.</em> This stirring prayer that has is origins in the Talmud makes use of a dual metaphor that informs so many of our thoughts and prayers this time of year.</p>
<p>Typically, the two metaphors represent different aspects of the way God relates to us and the way we relate to God. On the one hand God is our father and loves us like a father loves his children. We are God&#8217;s children and we look to God the way a child looks to a father. This is a compassionate, loving relationship that gives us comfort that no matter what</p>
<p>On the other hand God is our King. In this aspect of our relationship with God we find ourselves cowering in fear of God&#8217;s majesty and greatness. God is Master of the Universe. It&#8217;s God&#8217;s world and we are just guests in God&#8217;s world for a little while. This is meant to inspire reverence and respect for God.</p>
<p><span id="more-7604"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7607" alt="15" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/15.jpg" /></p>
<p>Put together, the two sides of the God Coin illuminate our attitudes this time of year. God loves us and is our Father, but God is also our King. There is plenty to say on this dichotomy. Perhaps we can take the usual interpretations of this dual metaphor one step deeper.</p>
<p>One does not choose one&#8217;s father. Fathers are imposed upon us. Everyone has a father. There is nothing particularly interesting about having a father. It&#8217;s built into the system. But most importantly, we can&#8217;t swap (biological) fathers. For better or worse, we&#8217;re stuck.</p>
<p>Monarchs are different. It&#8217;s true that one seems to be stuck with the king of the land where one is born. But the truth is that kings come and go. Borders change and people move. It&#8217;s a pure choice, but decided to pledge fealty to one&#8217;s king is a form of personal subjugation. It takes an act by the subject to crystallize the King and Subject relationship. If you don&#8217;t like your king you can try to mount a revolt or leave the area of jurisdiction. One day the king will die. Kings are not permanent nor are they automatic.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to God is there a choice? The kingship of God is not dependent on anything that we can do. It is automatic. We cannot leave God&#8217;s jurisdiction and move somewhere else to find another God. We are stuck.</p>
<p>That is why we also compare God to a father. While it&#8217;s true that God is like a king, the metaphor is incomplete. Comparing God to a king only goes so far. God cannot be deposed nor can one find a better or different God. That&#8217;s why we also need to compare God to a father. God is a king that is imposed upon us. We cannot trade Gods nor do we have a choice about who our God will be. In this sense, God as our father illustrates the imperative nature of God&#8217;s kingship over us.</p>
<p>Conversely, when we relate to God as a father we can feel stuck in a negative sense. We can wish we had a different father or we can dream about being free from the shadow of our parents. This is why we sometimes need to relate to God as our king. We voluntarily accept God as our king and as our father. This aspect of God as our king transforms our relationship with God as a father. It&#8217;s not just that we deal with God like a sometimes petulant child that would love to break free of God. We willingly subjugate ourselves in God&#8217;s kingdom even though we God is our father.</p>
<p>Above all else, I think this dual metaphor must inspire us to strive to be good sons and daughters to God as well as good subjects. Sometimes we act toward God with the love and admiration of a son or daughter. Other times we need to draw on the strength of relating to God as subjects in God&#8217;s eternal kingdom. It&#8217;s not enough to think about God as our father and king. We must also think about how <em>we are</em> God&#8217;s children and the people who live in God&#8217;s kingdom. The metaphor can&#8217;t stop with how we think about God. The metaphor needs to affect the way we think about ourselves as well.</p>
<p>When we appreciate the metaphor of <em>Avinu Malkeinu</em> we can feel a sense of love and fear that mixes together in the perfect service of God cocktail. Drink up!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It takes courage for any victim of abuse to come forward and accuse their abuser. It&#8217;s almost suicidal to try it in New Square. Yet, that is just what a young man named Yossi has done.</p>
<p>He sat down with News 12 Westchester for an in depth report. Journalist Tara Rosenblum talked with Yossi and spent some time in New Square researching this story. She does an excellent job.  If she&#8217;s eligible, I vote this reporter for the Pulitzer.<span id="more-7598"></span></p>
<p>The heartbreaking part of this is neighbors and children naively believing that the abuser Herschel Taubenfeld is not only innocent, but he is a safe person around their children. He is not. Yet, he is teaching in the school and mothers have no problem with it whatsoever.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-7602" alt="Screen Shot 2013-08-31 at 10.39.14 PM" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.39.14-PM-600x340.png" width="420" height="238" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s even worse is that Yossi, for all his bravery, did not even manage to keep Taubenfeld off the streets. The Ramapo DA thinks that six years probation is going to keep kids safe. I don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s possible. No one is going to report this guy to the police again so it&#8217;s unlikely that his probation will deter him nor will he ever violate the probation because he will never be reported.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how Rabbi Noson Leiter got involved in this case. I thought his thing was being anti-gay marriage. Anyway, he says the right things even if his part of the segment made me cringe.</p>
<p>This kid gets a medal for coming forward and hopefully he can inspire some sanity to this town. At the very least, people who don&#8217;t live in New Square should not be supporting or visiting this make believe city upon a hill until they get their act together. Attempted murder and rape can not be tolerated but in New Square they are. It&#8217;s time for the good people of the world to make it stop.</p>
<p>Watch the segment and cheer for Yossi.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life, so that you may live, you and your children.”</em> &#8211; Deuteronomy 30:19</p>
<p>As we near the end of the life and times of Moses, his speech to the Israelites picks up steam and power. One of the most profound statements in the Torah is found near the beginning of this week’s parsha. Moses tells the Israelites that heaven and earth bear witness that Moses has given the Israelites a choice. The ultimate choice. They can choose life or they can choose death. Then in dramatic fashion, the people are then instructed to choose life.<span id="more-7592"></span></p>
<p>Choose life! To life! <em>L’chaim</em>! This is the essence of Judaism. We toast to life. We sing to life. Life is a gift and we choose to use it well. The life we are given is a life of choices. We are instructed to make the choices that are the choices of life. It is so simple, yet so profound. Especially when we consider the religious leanings of the ancients, where death was so integral to their religions, where human sacrifice was normal, the Torah’s charge to choose life bellows loudly with its profundity and its eternal message echoes across the millennia.</p>
<p>This verse is an example of the best of the Bible. Its dramatic overtones staking out the all encompassing issues of the human experience. When our souls feel lost we must always remember to choose life. That is the great compass of Judaism. Find life and go that way. Choose life!<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7593" alt="choices" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/choices-600x449.jpg" /></p>
<p>For all its drama in the Bible, the Talmud brings this verse back down to earth with a shocking thud. Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva have a dispute about just what it means to choose life. Rabbi Yishmael says that “life” refers to a trade or a craft &#8211; the ability to earn a livelihood. We are being instructed to choose a means to make a living. Rabbi Akiva says that life refers to matters of safety and recreation like swimming and boating. Ti him, choosing life means taking care of one’s physical condition and making certain that one is prepared for a physical world that carries with it inherent danger.</p>
<p>These interpretations, while utilitarian and wise, seem to be so impossible to hear in the context of the verse that we are left to wonder if these great rabbi can actually be serious. Moses is building to a crescendo in his speech and he takes a break from the sublime to discuss career options and water sports? The verse was so powerful in its basic meaning, where is the depth and the beauty now?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is yes. Indeed, it is sublime to live a life engaged in the world. That is the climax. That is the greatest life that can be chosen. We are to be active participants in the economic and social structure of our world and to do so ever mindful and aware of G-D and one’s Judaism &#8211; that is life! To choose life is to to live a life. An actual life. A normal, productive, material life. When one lives that life to its fullest and lives one’s Judaism to the fullest we are truly choosing life.</p>
<p>Choosing life does not mean that one should cut their self off from society. Life is to live amongst men and women. But to live this life elevated and infused with spirituality as one lives amongst others &#8211; that is to choose life. There is a place for meditation and reflection or even temporary complete immersion into Torah and purely spiritual pursuits. But <em>u’vacharta b’chaim</em> &#8211; to choose life &#8211; is only when that is firmly welded to material pursuits and responsibility.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yishmael was the same great sage who famously argued with Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. In his statement about the topic of working for a living, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai taught that one should do G-D’s will and their work will be performed by others. Rabbi Yishmael argued that one should work the land and earn a livelihood. His views on this matter are clear. Life is to work.</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiva attached himself to Bar Kochba. He was not satisfied living under the rule of a despotic and anti-Semitic Roman government. He dreamed of autonomy and safety. The idea was to rise up and rebel militarily. With weapons and men at arms. Rabbi Akiva did not rely on his piety or Torah study to protect him or the people. Nor did he assume that his Torah study would be sufficient to restore the land into Jewish hands. Rabbi Akiva supported a physical army in addition to the merits of Torah and Mitzvos.</p>
<p>Choose life means choose to live a life engaged in the world all the while meticulously adhering to G-D’s word and living a life of Torah, Mitzvos and <em>Kiddush Hashem</em>. Indeed, this is a profound statement worthy of placement in the climactic peak of this speech of Moses. It is not just life, it is our way of life.</p>
<p>Speaking to his congregation following the Woodstock Festival in 1969, Rabbi Lamm talked about Hippie culture as compared to Judaism. Hippies believed that life was an opportunity to “live it up.” Love, music, and drugs were pathways to nirvana in their worldview.</p>
<p>To this, Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva respond and say we choose life with work. To live means to earn a livelihood. To live means to be prepared for life’s difficult moments. The truly virtuous life is not the life of shortcuts and temporarily highs. When we choose life we are choosing to live a life of challenges. We meet those challenges with Torah principles along with secular training. When we are able to navigate the difficult moments in our lives, when we can grow from trying times, when we use our gifts and talents to transcend the material world, then we are truly choosing life.</p>
<p>Hippies are passé. Woodstock a distant memory. But contemporary society has adopted so much of that worldview into modern thinking. Freedom and love are enough to give meaning to life and they are enough to truly live. Our response is that to truly find freedom and love we must work to get there. That is how we choose life. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know when or exactly how or why, but at some point in my childhood I became enamored with Martin Luther King Jr. and the speech he gave 50 years ago today. I remember that one of the first things I did on the Internet was listen to the speech. I will never forget the euphoric feeling I experienced when I heard Dr. King say <em>&#8220;&#8230;when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God&#8217;s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, &#8220;Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!&#8221;<span id="more-7585"></span></em></p>
<p>The speech influenced me greatly and I had a <a href="http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf" target="_blank">faux archive version copy of the speech</a> in my childhood desk drawer.</p>
<p>Ever since then I have shared the same dream as Dr. King.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7586" alt="GTY_MLK_march_on_washington_1963_lpl_130801_16x9_608" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GTY_MLK_march_on_washington_1963_lpl_130801_16x9_608-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Content of their character. We are getting there. It&#8217;s very hard to avoid our natural biases. It&#8217;s a lifetime effort. It&#8217;s something everyone needs to work on and Dr. King calls upon us to do just that.</p>
<p>Similarly, I urge all of us to judge ideas by the content and substance of the idea and not the value we place in the person making the statement.</p>
<p>But I have a dream that in the Jewish community we can judge one another by the content of our character and not by our affiliations and style of clothing. My dream is that we can create a global Jewish community united by far more than the things that separate us.</p>
<p>One day, all Jews, no matter their belief in God, Torah M&#8217;Sinai, or the Afterlife will work together to provide positive Jewish experiences for our communities. One day, whether we are Zionist or indifferent, liberal or conservative,  we can form a united Jewish nation. One day, mystics and rationalists, GRAniks and chasidim will dance together. One day it won&#8217;t matter who one&#8217;s grandparents were or which town one&#8217;s family came from in Europe or &#8220;God forbid,&#8221; if they came from one of the Arab countries.</p>
<p>Dr. King&#8217;s dream resonates with all of us. It gives us hope for a better future. A future where pettiness and narcissism give way to tolerance and empathy. That is my dream.</p>
<p>How do we get there? We fight against drawing imaginary lines that only serve to divide us. We argue for the rights of those who are under-represented within our ranks. We strive to give our children every opportunity to succeed and find meaningful, joyous, passionate Judaism that is inclusive, understanding, and loving. We reach out to our ideological opponents and offer them friendship with no strings attached. We explore innovative and comprehensive solutions to our social problems instead of applying bandaids to severed limbs.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a dream. But it&#8217;s a dream I believe in strongly. It is a dream worth fighting for. It is a dream that Dr. King inspired in a little boy who grew up to be me.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, the speech echoes through my brain. It&#8217;s message cuts through the noise and sings a beautiful song of hope. Thank you Dr. King for inspiring generations of people and thank you for inspiring me with the greatest speech I have ever had the privilege to hear. On its 50th anniversary we say thank you.</p>
<p>I hope we will live to see your dream come true and all of our dreams as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An interview with Rabbi Mendel Epstein has gone viral. The protagonist of the article is Rabbi Epstein, a man who has dedicated his life to helping women navigate the rough waters of Jewish divorce. He is a professional to&#8217;ein (Jewish for lawyer) and advocates for women. He has a lot of insight. He also carries a bias. We all do. There&#8217;s no crime in bias. But it&#8217;s important that we know what we are dealing with.<span id="more-7576"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7580" alt="82507772MB023_2008_Republic" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bill-of-Rights1-600x296.jpg" /></p>
<p>In terms of substance, I agree with a lot of what Rabbi Epstein says. Obviously. Who wouldn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>He comes off a bit paternalistic at times. He&#8217;s also working in a very male dominated social environment so some of what he says sounds uncomfortable to more modern ears. I think it&#8217;s clear that he is talking about a fairly insular charedi community. Most of the modern orthodox or even centrist yeshiva type people I know are fully aware of these things and don&#8217;t need to be informed or even reminded to treat their wives respectfully.</p>
<p>Four items in his &#8220;Bill of Rights&#8221; for Orthodox Jewish wives are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(1) A wife must be treated with respect and not be abused. A woman in an abusive relationship has a right to seek a get.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(2) She is entitled to be supported by her husband. Read the kesubah.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(3) A husband is obligated to honor and respect his wife’s parents.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(4) She is entitled to a normal conjugal relationship.</p>
<p>He also cites some very specious anecdotal evidence about divorce and infidelity that sound exaggerated. He basically tries to assert the &#8220;it might lead to mixed dancing&#8221; argument as fact.</p>
<p>But here is the real problem. What kind of society needs to be told these things? How is this all not patently obvious? What kind of world needs a rabbi to affirm these basic principles?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as if Rabbi Epstein is saying that there a few people who need to be reminded or scolded about these things. He seems to be saying that this Bill of Rights is necessary for our entire society. This makes me ill.</p>
<p>We tout our communities as safe havens from the dysfunction on the outside. But is it true? Is there dysfunction on the outside? Are we functioning better? These are very difficult claims to answer. Rabbi Epstein seems to be poking a hole in our armor. It seems that in some ways we need to look to the outside as our guide on how to behave. Ask any middle-class, educated, family orientated person about marriage and there is no doubt that they will echo Rabbi Epstein&#8217;s supposed bombshell.</p>
<p>But how does this happen? How is it that we are falling behind?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that we have demonized the outside so much in our communities and educational systems that we passively reject whatever they espouse. We gloss over חכמה בגויים תאמין. We think that we have the answers and they don&#8217;t. Eventually this leads us to a place where we tune out the good ideas and advice from the outside and bad habits and poor social standards become set in our communities.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that there are many people who need to hear this Bill of Rights. But I also don&#8217;t doubt that anyone normal would agree with them. So why does it need to be said? It has to be that we simply ignore these issues. Why are we ignoring them if the rest of modern society is addressing them? There is no satisfactory answer to this question.</p>
<p>One more thing. Rabbi Epstein places too much faith in the Beis Din system. I have never in my entire life heard of someone who had a positive Beis Din experience. It seems extremely unlikely that a woman&#8217;s best course of action is to go to a Beis Din that requires both parties to agree to a binding arbitration. The problems with our Beis Din system are well known and it&#8217;s a disservice to his audience that Rabbi Esptein recommends entering into this basically corrupt system. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/18/restoring-credibility-to-the-beis-din-system/" target="_blank">Restoring Credibility to the Beis Din System</a>.</p>
<p>The article ends with a call for action and ideas for solutions. I think it&#8217;s pretty simple. Reinstitute חכמה בגויים תאמין. Start learning from the outside. Read secular books of marriage and intimacy. Pay attention to what psychologist, marriage therapists, and secular experts say. Rabbis have to stop dismissing everything that comes from outside the Beis Medrash. We can learn a lot from experts on these matters, especially intimacy. We have to start respecting people outside our community and not believing as a matter of faith that a <em>yarmulka</em> and a <em>sheitel</em> and a <em>vort</em> and a 500 guest wedding and <em>sheva brachos</em> and <em>shana rishona</em> are going to magically make for great marriages and happy couples.</p>
<p>There are many very happy marriages within our community. There are also many happy marriages outside our community. We can learn from them. We should learn from them. Hopefully we can arrive at a place where we can laugh at the absolute silliness of a Bill of Rights that says not to abuse women, to provide for one&#8217;s family, and to be intimate with one&#8217;s wife. I hope we get there soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="fb-root">
<p>Not everyone loves the High Holidays. I do. Part of the reason I love the High Holidays is because of the place I experience Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. For the last five years I have been privileged to serve as the rabbi (and unofficial cantor) at Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach. I have never enjoyed the High Holidays as much as I do at the Pacific Jewish Center.<span id="more-7568"></span></p>
<p>We are proud of our diversity on a regular week. We are an orthodox synagogue where many non-orthodox Jews pray and participate in the services. It&#8217;s important to us that we be a model synagogue of accessibility and inclusiveness. We boast members from a potpourri of countries, ethnicities, and religious backgrounds. All of that is exponentially greater on the High Holidays. Many of our friends and neighbors come to Shul a few times per year. They come on Rosh Hashanah, the come on Yom Kippur, and they come for <em>Yizkor</em> or a <em>Yartzeit.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7570" alt="Shofar" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Shofar-600x375.jpg" />When the Shul is packed with our most dedicated members and everyone else for all walks of life and all backgrounds, one cannot help but feel inspired. All of this with the beach at our backs, the sun shining, the wind blowing, and a Mardi Gras-like atmosphere just outside our doors. There is nothing like it, anywhere.</p>
<p>I often hear from people who either loathe the High Holidays or at best they tolerate these days. They ask how they can cope or survive this time of year. To those people and anyone else looking for something new, I suggest giving us a shot. You may find it completely different than wherever you&#8217;ve been until now. The services are well paced, the people are super friendly, and the location is beyond words. I promise not to bore you with longwinded talks or super slow chanting. We&#8217;ll even give you a little <em>kiddush</em> before the Shofar blasts and an invitation to lunch somewhere will be hard to avoid.</p>
<p>Here is a link to our schedule: <a href="http://pjcenter.shulcloud.com/holiday-schedule.html" target="_blank">pjcenter.com</a></p>
<p>For more information and to reserve your seats, please contact our office staff at<a href="mailto:info@pjcenter.com" target="_blank"> info@pjcenter.com</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“The LORD will establish you for a holy people to Himself, as He has sworn to you; if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in His ways. And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the LORD is called upon you; and they shall be [...]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>“The LORD will establish you for a holy people to Himself, as He has sworn to you; if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in His ways. And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the LORD is called upon you; and they shall be afraid of you.” &#8211; Deuteronomy 28:9-10 </i></p>
<p>Before Moses delivers a litany of curses upon the Israelites he offers some words of hope and blesses the people. In summary, Moses tells the people that if they follow the word of G-D all kinds of good things will happen for them. <i>“You will blessed in the city and you will be blessed in the field.”</i> And so on.<span id="more-7558"></span></p>
<p>The incentive to be good is strong. One of the more powerful verses of blessing describes how we will be perceived by the nations of the world if we are obedient to G-D’s word. The verse tells us that people of the earth will “see G-D’s name upon us” and they will be afraid of us.</p>
<p>What is this fear? Why will the nations fear us? What is this name of G-D that arouses this fear?<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Ki-Savo-2013-Web-Dvar-Torah.pdf"><br />
</a><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7560" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/monumental-tefillin-600x448.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Talmud (Brachos 6a) says that R’ Eliezer teaches us that this “name of G-D” is the <i>Tefillin</i> that is worn upon the head. One has to wonder what R’ Eliezer means with this statement. Does he meant that if we wear our <i>tefillin </i>we will be protected from persecution and ridicule? Are the <i>tefillin</i> a magical talisman? Is it that simple? Is that even possible?</p>
<p>There are photos of great Jewish martyrs during the Holocaust wearing their <i>Tefillin</i>. It seems that the Nazis did not fear our <i>tefillin</i>. What happened? Was it just a matter of us not being worthy of the blessing? Exactly what is R’ Eliezer saying?</p>
<p>Rabbi Lamm explains R’ Eliezer’s statement by observing the context of the Talmudic passage. Immediately after R’ Eliezer says that the “name of G-D” upon us is the <i>tefillin </i>that is worn upon the head, the Talmud wonders about G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i></p>
<p>The Talmud asks: And what is written in G-D’s <i>tefillin</i>? In G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>we would find a verse lauding the Jewish people. “Who is like the Jewish people, one nation upon the earth?” Meaning, our <i>tefillin</i> speak to G-D’s unity as expressed in the four chapters we place inside, accordingly G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>speak to our unity. It’s a symbiotic relationship. We express G-D’s unity and G-D expresses ours.</p>
<p>In a novel twist, Rabbi Lamm proclaims that R’ Eliezer was not actually referring to our <i>tefillin </i>at all! Rather he was referring to G-D’s <i>tefillin!</i> That is the context of the <i>sugya. </i>In other words, when we live the maxim of G-D’s <i>tefillin</i> then the people of the earth will fear us. What is that maxim? That we have unity and that we are a singular nation.</p>
<p>When we are comfortable and confident in our singularity we succeed. R’ Eliezer is teaching us to be strong in our ability to stand on our own. If we can stand strong on our own, we inspire awe from the people of the earth. When we are not vying for approval or desperately trying to assimilate, we are demonstrating to the world the message of G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i> However, if do try to leave our Jewishness at home, or worse in the trash heap of history, the people of the earth will not find anything awesome about the Jewish people.</p>
<p>The idea is that when people are confident in their convictions and believe what they are doing is right, they earn the respect of others. Of course, this only applies when one is also respectful and kind to the others. Acting zealously because we think we are right and everyone else is wrong will undoubtably result in treatment in kind. If we are hateful toward others or act in a manner that breeds hate, we can expect to be treated at least as badly by those others. But there is a way to act in confidence with respect for others. This is exactly what R’ Eliezer was trying to say. When we are doing the right thing, with the confidence of G-D’s <i>tefillin</i> we earn the awe and reverence of others.</p>
<p>This is all on a national level. When the Jewish people as a whole act the way they are supposed to act, and we do so with confidence and pride, we gain the respect of others.</p>
<p>As much as it applies to us as a people, it applies to us as individuals as well. We can see this from the the man who taught us this lesson in the Talmud. It’s not just our confidence as a nation but also confidence as individual people.</p>
<p>R’ Eliezer lived this maxim. He found himself on the opposing side of the rabbis of his generation time and time again. His opinions are disproportionately unpopular. R’ Eliezer is most well known for the incident regarding the <i>tanur shel achnai</i> where his opinion differed from the other sages. But he stood by his convictions even inviting nature itself to testify on his behalf. It did not matter than his colleagues had the numbers. R’ Eliezer believed he was right. Ultimately, none of that mattered as we follow the majority in rabbinic disputes of halacha. Indeed, R’ Eliezer paid a price as he lived out his days in isolation as punishment for not acceding to the rabbis. But R’ Eliezer stood tall and true to his convictions. R’ Eliezer’s strength and confidence shines through this and other episodes in the Talmud. He lived the ideas G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i></p>
<p>As a people we struggle with this. On the one hand we have adapted and adopt from our surroundings over the course of our collective history. There is tension between this chameleon-like attitude toward our environment and our ancient traditions that sometimes put us at odds with our neighbors and their ideas. It requires us to dance around the raindrops sometimes. But we must remember that we believe we have the truth. We must be careful to be respectful and friendly to all who are not members of our group while we stand by our convictions with confidence.</p>
<p>Within Judaism we have subgroups as well. Each is entitled to believe it is doing Judaism the right way. However our confidence in our subgroup cannot allow us lose respect and courtesy to our co-religionists from other subgroups. If we pervert our confidence in our way of life with hate and demonization of others our confidence is mere braggadocio.</p>
<p>We certainly should feel that our way of life is the right way to live. Some subgroups excel at this while other languish in self-loathing. I think the least confident subgroup in Judaism is Modern Orthodoxy. This is not a criticism of the Modern Orthodox theology, rather it is a reflection of a sad reality that too many Modern Orthodox Jews feel second class.</p>
<p>All subgroups should feel confident that they are doing G-D’s will. All subgroups should be respectful of the other subgroups. Modern Orthodoxy should be proud of their way of life. There is no need to constantly defer to other subgroups. Modern Orthodoxy can be vibrant and viable in our world.</p>
<p>When Modern Orthodoxy can live confidently it will flourish. It will find G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>are easily discerned among Modern Orthodox Jews. With the deftness that only Modern Orthodoxy can possess, its people will inspire awe and wonder among the people of the earth, not least of which, the rest of the Jewish people. - <em>Good Shabbos</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another voice has entered the online discussion about Bible Criticism and orthodox Judaism. Professor Jacob L. Wright is an orthodox Jew who has studied, taught, and written extensively on Bible Criticism.</p>
<p>He made waves Pesach time when he published a provocative article on the Huffington Post where he talked about &#8220;The Myth of Moses.&#8221; In his article he explained that his view of the Bible is that it is a composite work with each layer added for a specific reason. In the Moses story, there was a need to justify the existence of an Egyptian prince named Moses who saved the Israelites and establish him as a bona fide Israelite. So the Bible tells the story of a boy who was cast off by his mother into the Nile. This story has very obscure references as the names of the major players in the story are not mentioned. Later, the story was viewed as salacious so new details were added as a prologue to the story.<span id="more-7473"></span></p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t the Bible and I weren&#8217;t orthodox, this would be a great theory to explain anomalies in the text. But it is the Bible and I am orthodox so it hardly sits well with me when the Bible is explained away as myth.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7475" alt="157328845" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/157328845-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p>Professor Wright was interview by Professor Alan Brill on his <a href="http://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/08/19/interview-with-prof-jacob-wright-of-emory-university/" target="_blank">Kavvanah</a> website. The interview is worth your time and consideration if you don&#8217;t mind reading what is widely considered to be absolute kefira.</p>
<p>The first important thing in the interview is the introduction where Brill outlines the current status of Biblical Criticism. It&#8217;s required reading so I copy it in full here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As background, the problems of the Bible go back to the tenth and eleventh century Islamic critiques of the Bible by Ibn Hazm and others. Second, modern figures such as Spinoza and Jean Astruc sought to understand the Bible as a human book using the same tools that we use to understand Greek and Roman books. And in the 19th century, Wellhausen popularized a theory that the Pentateuch had four authors. But the important part of his theory was that the ritual and priestly material was a priestly Pharisaic digression from the original pure faith of the prophets necessitating Christianity for a restoration. Hence, Solomon Schechter called it higher anti-Semitism, David Zvi Hoffman showed that Leviticus is not in contradiction to the rest of the story, Kaufman showed that the prophets assumed the priestly material, and Cassuto showed based on Sumerian and Akkadian sources that the divisions fail.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Well, Wellhausen was writing a century ago, with the aforementioned defenses all formulated in a post WWI climate. For at least forty years the field was already given to authors such as Gunkel who assumes the Bible is legend, the way Gilgamesh is legend. And Martin Noth who assumed most of the narrative was formulated originally as oral traditions- read here. Questions of redaction were not tied to Wellhausen, or even literary documents, but to oral traditions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What do historians currently think about the context of the Bible? They assume that it was written between 720 BCE and 587 BCE, between the destruction of the Northern Kingdom destruction of Jerusalem, with some editing until the end of Ezra’s life circa 440 BCE. (Minimalists make it more recent and Evangelicals defend the chronological dates.) They work from parallels to Assyrian texts, the nature of script, linguistics, and reconstructed context of author. Little of this has anything to do with literary doublets. If you want to reject historical criticism, then start learning ancient linguistics and texts contemporary to the Bible. No harmonization of passages changes this dating nor does anything from Cassutto or Hoffman affect it. (However, Prof. Josh Berman is seeking to shift the discussion from Assyrians to the Hittites in 1300 BCE, an effort that may be accepted by the Orthodox but does not promise to have much of an impact on the experts. But it is better than refuting Kugel, who is not a historian of ancient Israel or source critic so the critique does not help.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This past May there was a major conference at Hebrew University on“Convergence and Divergence in Pentateuchal Theory;” if you are interested in these topics, then that was the place to be. The conference opened up with a clear statement that there are three approaches: a Documentary approach (not based on Wellhausen but on Noth and others) where there are separate documents; a Supplementary approach,where a single document get more and more complex; and a Fragmentary approach, where we cannot separate out authors or layers anymore.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finally returning to Cassuto, he may have rejected Wellhausen but he accepted historical context, showing that all the numbers and genealogies in Genesis do not correspond to ages and events, rather are stylized number, ten generations, twelve children. He does this by reading the ancient parallels to the Biblical story.<br />
Wright answers Brill&#8217;s various questions and hte discussion is fascinating and worth your time.</p>
<p>However I would like to focus on the end of the interview. Here, Brill asks the million dollar question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>How can one be a shomer Torah uMizvot and accept historical criticism?</em></p>
<p>Wright basically dodges the question by attacking those who attack Biblical Criticism without a background in the field. He also reassures the reader that there are plenty of scholars who are shomer Torah u&#8217;Mitzvos. Wright reiterates the question and fails to provide a sufficient answer. If anything his answer strengthens the question. He answers that he is in awe of the authors of the Bible. Their genius makes it a compelling work. In conclusion the Torah is authoritative but not divine.</p>
<p>I tried to follow up in the comments and ask why anyone would feel compelled to adhere to an ancient man made book of rules. Wright replied that the Torah as divine origins but is not divine. I was eventually directed to Gideon Slifkin&#8217;s Facebook page where Wright says he went into more detail. I followed instructions but the discussion there did not deliver.</p>
<p>This is the crux of the issue. In mainstream frum circles today, from Satmar and Lakewood to YU and Merkaz HaRav, the assumption is that if the Torah is not approximately 99.99% of what God gave Moses at Sinai then people would not keep the Torah. That is the basic assumption. The fear of Bible Criticism is that it assumes (or even purports to prove) that the Torah is not 100% divine. Some scholars say it&#8217;s 0% divine, but that is not a necessary assumption to Bible Criticism. The only way Bible Criticism will ever be accepted in mainstream frum circles is if this assumption about keeping the Torah changes. If this assumption is replaced with the assumption that people will keep the Torah even if the Torah we have today is a composite work based on an original divine revelation at Sinai then the fear of Bible Criticism disappears.</p>
<p>As an aside, I see no reason to think that this assumption (i.e. that even if God is not responsible for 100% of the Torah we would keep the Torah) could not work. We keep plenty of things that are not from God. We keep all the Rabbinic Mitzvos and many customs on top of those as well. So I think there is no reason that the current assumption is unimpeachable and unchangeable.</p>
<p>The challenge will be carving out a version of Biblical Criticism that doesn&#8217;t undermine our mandate that we keep the Torah but allows for subsequent emendations and additions. Is it possible? Not yet. It will only become a possibility once we as a collective group realize that the Torah need not be 100% from God in order for us to keep it. But once the current assumption is replaced with the new assumption I think we will see Bible Criticism seep into the frum community as an acceptable form of study. As a matter of comparison, Talmudic criticism was once considered taboo and is gaining slow acceptance in some frum circles.</p>
<p>For all the uproar over R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s position, I feel that his is far more tenable than Wright&#8217;s position on this issue. R&#8217; Farber holds that prophets made additions to the original text of the Torah. This is extremely controversial, but at least God is the one doing the writing, albeit through God&#8217;s prophets. Wright&#8217;s version has too much human interference to be taken seriously as a document that requires our attention. His basic approach is that if it&#8217;s meaningful we will do it no matter where it comes from. This is weak and I doubt it would survive more than a couple generations at most.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the assumption about what it takes for people to keep the Torah is far too limiting. Once it expands I think we will see an increase in Bible Criticism that is acceptable in frum circles. I hope we can get there before we lose too many people based on the wrong assumptions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago the Star-K, a world renowned Kashrus agency, announced that they were certifying kosher phones. These phones have no access to the Internet, cannot place or receive text messages, cannot take photos, and most importantly, cannot be hacked to perform any of these tasks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not troubling to me that people would want a phone that is insulated from certain tasks. Although I think it is an unnecessary measure and perhaps counter productive, I don&#8217;t begrudge people their personal self control restraints.<span id="more-7468"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7469" alt="cert1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/cert1.jpg" /></p>
<p>What is troubling is that a kashrus agency is part of this initiative. A kashrus agency should be concerned with one thing and one thing only. Their singular concern should be the kosher status of the food. I don&#8217;t even think that a kashrus agency must concern itself with humanitarian or other ethical issues that may arise. I have no problem with a secondary agency coming in and providing a secondary level of supervision. But the kosher status of the food cannot be affected by anything other its status as kosher food.</p>
<p>So when I see a kashrus agency entering into the phone market, I see an agency that should be worried about kosher status of food but is now legislating morality. It&#8217;s not even as if the technical skills involved in kosher supervision overlap the neutering of cell phones. They have nothing to do with each other. I don&#8217;t think it is smart for kosher supervision to be intertwined or even related to morality supervision.</p>
<p>Similarly, when kosher supervision agencies make demands on the clientele or ambience of an eating establishment I believe they are overstepping their bounds. There are restaurants that are not allowed to be open at certain hours because they will lose their hechsher if they are open. This is far beyond the scope of kosher supervision. Tell me if the food is kosher and I will decide if I want to patronize the restaurant. That is all we need from a kashrus agency. The stretching of their authority serves no important purpose for the public. It seems to me that it is merely a self-serving, self-righteous way to legislate their morality. If they can legislate phones and who can eat where, what&#8217;s next?</p>
<p>I am not making a slippery slope argument. I am pointing out that there is no logical connection between the kosher status of food and the kosher status of a phone. There is also no relationship between the kosher status of a restaurant and whether teenagers are hanging out. In other words, the kashrus agencies are already legislating their morality. There is no reason to think it only will apply in these two instances because there is no connection between these two things and the kosher status of food.</p>
<p>We need to stop using the word kosher for things other than food. Yes, the word is a general term but it has evolved into a word that describes whether food can be eaten by orthodox Jews who keep kosher. We don&#8217;t eat anything that is not kosher. Using the word kosher for phones and Internet implies that the non-kosher versions are not allowed to be used. This is sophomoric and divisive.</p>
<p>If anything, the kashrus agencies should be concerned with the ethics and morality of the actual food. This is something they have resisted time and time again. I am not recommending they get into the ethics of food business, but if they must expand their business and purview of supervision I think that is the first place they should be looking to legislate seeing as they have the knowledge and expertise to monitor and report on that aspect of food production. But teens mingling and phones? They don&#8217;t belong there at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night the Red Sox and Yankees played the rubber match of their three game series at Fenway Park. Over the last 15 years these series&#8217; have meant a great deal to both teams as they battled for AL East supremacy and often enough for the best record in baseball.</p>
<p>These days, the stakes are not quite as high as the Yankees are no longer one of the best teams in the AL East. But there was some added drama to the weekend series despite the lower stakes.</p>
<p>Alex Rodriguez is in the midst of a huge controversy. What began as a simple performance enhancing drug use suspension has ballooned into a media and litigation circus. Arod has now been accused of ratting on teammates and others. He claims the Yankees are trying to smear him and ruin his career. It&#8217;s a very complicated mess.<span id="more-7463"></span></p>
<p>Some baseball people view PED use as enough to be banned from the game. But nearly all baseball people agree that snitching on a teammate is beyond the pale. Thus, the brotherhood of baseball players wished to exact revenge on Arod the nogoodnik.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7464" alt="081813-MLB-Yankees-Alex-Rodriguez-PI2-AA_20130818231449469_660_320" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/081813-MLB-Yankees-Alex-Rodriguez-PI2-AA_20130818231449469_660_320-600x290.jpg" /></p>
<p>Their salvation came from a pitcher on the Red Sox named Ryan Dempster. In his first at bat, Arod saw four pitches. The first went behind him. The second and third nearly hit him. The fourth hit him square in the back. To everyone in the world it was obvious what had just happened. Dempster deliberately hit Arod. The reasons were up for debate. Was it personal? Was it about PEDs? Was it about being a sideshow? Was it about being a snitch? Was it the combination of all of it. But no matter who you ask, everyone will agree that Dempster hit Arod on purpose.</p>
<p>In the end, Arod handled it with class and propelled the Yankees to victory. It&#8217;s an odd day when Arod is the good guy and the hero. But that&#8217;s what happened.</p>
<p>Beaning baseball players in a time honored tradition. It has a similar feel to it as fist fights during hockey games. NBA and NFL rules have less opportunity for targeting a player outside the rules of the game, but Ron Artest (not the Malice in the Palace incident &#8211; I am referring to in-game violence), Bruce Bowen, Ndamukong Suh, and Albert Haynesworth demonstrate that when there is a will there is a way. However, those incidents are punished by their games and are not considered part of the game. Baseball and hockey enjoy a special distinction that intent to injure or harm outside the game can be considered as part of the game.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Yaakov Weinberg used to say that it was prohibited for a yeshiva student to play tackle football. (Most people did not follow this rule.) His reasoning was simple. How can one play a game where the entire point of the game is to hurt someone else? Now it could be argued that this might display a lack of nuance in understanding the game of tackle football. However, the principle is sound. A game is a game. But when it becomes about inflicting pain on others it moves from game to something else entirely.</p>
<p>People are defending Dempster. They are saying that Arod had it coming. It&#8217;s possible that Arod did deserve it. But I don&#8217;t think that we should support vigilante justice in our sports. Throwing a ball at 95 miles per hour at a very unprotected man is reckless. It happens all the time in baseball but that does not make it right. Intent to harm is not acceptable. I am not saying that pitchers can&#8217;t pitch inside or try to move batters off the plate. I am talking about deliberately throwing at an opponent for the purpose of hitting the opponent with the pitch should be banned. Intent is easy enough to discern in most cases. The grey area cases will require wisdom and good guess work, but I think the price is too high. A game should not provide an outlet for personal and private side shows that take away from the game and make the spectacle into a violent one. We all agree that if the batter would throw his bat at the pitcher he would be out of line. The opposite should be true as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for baseball to eliminate the deliberate bean ball. It has no place in the game and the people of our society should not condone this kind of behavior. Even from athletes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years of research and development, a man-made hamburger was publicly tasted for the first time last week. The burger was not animal flesh, instead it was grown in a laboratory. However, it was grown in a way that mimics the way animals grow their own flesh. Thus, it was pretty close to dead animal meat in flavor and texture.</p>
<p>This incredible scientific breakthrough prompted a plethora of questions. For the religious community with rituals and laws attached to the eating of meat even more questions were asked.<span id="more-7459"></span></p>
<p>It seemed that one could hardly browse the Internet for five seconds without seeing a juicy soundbite (sorry, couldn&#8217;t resist) about whether the meat was kosher or whether is was meat at all. Chabad&#8217;s website had one approach. OU had another approach. Reuters had a third opinion in their article. NBC added another view.</p>
<p>I must have been asked by a dozen people what to make of the man-made meat mystery.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7460" alt="k-bigpic" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/k-bigpic-600x337.gif" /></p>
<p>This is what I think. No one has any idea what they are talking about. Non-scientists have no chance of understanding the precise manner in which this meat was manufactured. I have tried to understand how it all works and it is almost impossible to find the full technical explanation with all the requisite background information. A very smart scientists tried explaining it to me, but even after I got the gist of the process I had more questions about stem cells and other background than I had before he explained it to me. I am pretty confident that Chabad, OU, the Reuters people, and even NBC News reporters don&#8217;t have a clue how this meat is made.</p>
<p>Sure, they  say &#8220;don&#8217;t rely on this for halacha&#8221; or something to that effect, but that makes things even worse. Why offer a meaningless opinion that is based on ignorance? It seems to make a mockery of Jewish law. But Jewish law is very serious and serious people will offer serious opinions on this matter. The proper response for almost the entire population of planet Earth to these eternal questions about man-made meat is &#8220;I am not qualified to render an opinion on this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a thorough understanding of how the meat is made, any discussion of the halachic ramifications of the meat is not even conjecture. It is pure fantasy. Further, deciding the halachic status of this issue will require a breadth of Torah knowledge that is possessed by a mere handful of people on the planet. You can&#8217;t <em>pasken</em> this <em>shyla</em> with Yad Moshe, Google, or the Otzar. This is a brand new question of Jewish law and will need serious investigation into the science and the various tenuously analogous precedents in Jewish law. The Torah does not discuss synthetic meat. And even if it did, who says this meat would be the same as the synthetic meat found in Jewish law?</p>
<p>The only way this question can be seriously answered is with a conference of scientists and rabbis who fit the descriptions above. Scientists who can thoroughly explain how the meat is made and Torah scholars who know <em>kol haTorah kula</em> will need to decide this issue. Anyone else jumping into the discussion is wielding a knife in a nuclear war. It&#8217;s that useless.</p>
<p>If I can, I will try to attain a scientific understanding of how this meat is produced and then perhaps I will be qualified to even ask the question to my (qualified) <em>posek.</em> But until such time, I wouldn&#8217;t dare wade into this very, very deep pool. I think this is the proper policy under the circumstances. We sound more educated and cutting edge when we admit what we don&#8217;t know as opposed to when we pretend we know what we are discussing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best database of <em>seforim </em>(books written about Torah topics are called <em>seforim</em> even though the word just means books, it has connotations of holiness and importance) is Otzar HaHochma. The Otzar has every sefer you could possibly need. They have 47,350 books in the their database. Each of them is searchable so you can really find anything that&#8217;s been written about anything.</p>
<p>Searching is free but reading and printing cost money. Full, unlimited access costs a lot of money. (If you&#8217;d like to sponsor a subscription for me, I&#8217;ll graciously accept.)</p>
<p>There are several tiers of Otzar subscriptions. Here is the current pricelist:<span id="more-7450"></span></p>
<p><b>The Complete Otzar HaHochma – 47,350 books Cost: $1,890<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7452" alt="Censored Stamp Shows Prohibited And Censorship" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fathers-day-gift-ideas-8.jpg" /></b></p>

<p><b>Bnei Torah Edition – 45,150 books Cost: $1,685</b></p>
<p>Identical to the complete Otzar HaHochma but contains 1,200 less books. Certain books whose world outlook did not correspond to that of the Hareidi sector have been removed.</p>
<p><b>Otzar Gemara Ve’Halacha – 30,700 books Cost: $1,400</b></p>
<p>Thousands of books covering topics such as Mishnah and commentary, Babylonian Talmud and commentary, Jerusalem Talmud and commentary, Reponsa, Shulchan Aruch and commentary, halacha u’minhag, Torah files.</p>
<p><b>Otzar Torah U’Machshava – 26,400 books Cost: $1,250</b></p>
<p>Thousands of books covering such topics as Tanach and commentary, Chazal, Kabbalah, philosophy and ethics, Hassidism, Drushim, Jewish holidays, Jewish history, prayers and hymns and various others as well.</p>
<p><b>The Library Edition – 47,350 books Cost: $1,170 </b>This version includes all 41,500 books in the Complete Otzar edition, as well as all program options other than <b>the free</b> <b>search option</b>.</p>
<p><b>To add 880 books of Mosad Harav Kook (670 books in Bnei Torah Edition) Cost: $320</b></p>
<p>880 books (670 in bnei Torah edition) from the important publisher – basic works in all Torah fields in precise and<br />
uptodate editions: <i>Chidushei HaRitva, Rashba</i>, <i>Ran</i>, <i>Tosafot HaRosh</i>, <i>Mefarshei Hamikra Harishonim </i>series, <i>Torat Chaim </i>series<i>, Torah Umegilot, Tshuvot HaGeonim</i>, <i>Rishonim and Acharonim, Daat Mikra </i>on <i>Nach </i>series, <i>hagut </i>and <i>mussar</i>, <i>piyut </i>and <i>tefila</i>, research and bibliography, history, Hebrew Linguistics and much more.</p>
<p><b>To add 405 books of Machon Yerushalayim Publications Cost: $230</b></p>
<p>This unique package from a leading publisher of Jewish religious publications includes hundreds of books by <i>rishonim </i>and <i>acharonim</i>, such as <i>Shulchan Arukh Hashalem,Otzar Mefarshei Hatalmud, Sidrat Tshuvot Harishonim, Minchat Chinuch Hashalem, Noda Beyehuda Responsa, Sidrot Gedolei Ashkenaz, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, </i>and <i>Ohr Hamizrach</i><i>.</i></p>
<p><b>To add 420 Books of Ahavat Shalom Publishers Cost: $170</b></p>
<p>420 books of the Ahavat Shalom Publishers, including books published for the first time from manuscripts as well as fundamental books.</p>
<p><b>To add 4,200 books of Kehot Publication Society (Chabad) Cost: $ 90</b></p>
<p>An extensive collection of Chabad publications, including ancient and rare books, as well as all basic Chasidic sources, Torah files, history books, and albums. The collection has been made possible through the generous<br />
assistance of Kehat Publishing.</p>
<p><b>Network license</b>: <b>$210 </b>for each station.</p>
<p>Notice anything interesting?</p>
<p>The full database includes 47,350 books. But one can get a 45,150 book version as well. (Otzar thinks this is 1200 fewer books. It&#8217;s actually 2200). This version is called the &#8220;Bnei Torah&#8221; edition. The words bnei Torah are used to imply one is a yeshiva student or charedi. It&#8217;s unfortunate that one cannot be considered a modern ben Torah, but such is the foible of language. So if you are a ben Torah you don&#8217;t want access to 2,200 of the books on the Otzar database. These books are deemed inappropriate for charedim because they are inconsistent with charedi perspectives.</p>
<p>This is incredible. All the books in the Otzar are frum texts. They are all legitimate <em>seforim</em> from reputable Torah scholars. Yet, a small segment of these books is not consistent with charedi thinking. Well of course not! Not everything in Judaism has always been charedi. That much is obvious to any Torah scholar. But in order to reinforce an imaginary history where nothing was inconsistent with charedi Judaism, these books are excised from the subscription. It&#8217;s really amazing. These are not anti-orthodox books. That&#8217;s for sure. These are just books that &#8220;do not correspond to the Haredi sector.&#8221; Turns out, it&#8217;s forbidden to read books that might inform you that your way of life is not the only way of life that is legitimate within orthodox Judaism. Pretty sad.</p>
<p>As for me, I want a list of these 2200 books. I also want to know who the censor is and what the criteria are for removal from the Bnei Torah list. I also want to learn those 2200 seforim, pronto.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am reluctant to write a post just to respond to a random &#8220;heartfelt plea&#8221; that was circulating on the Internet yesterday. In the letter, a single woman asks her friends for more understanding and in a series of contradictory instructions dispensed advice for her friends. I won&#8217;t respond to her letter. It&#8217;s too raw and too much emotion for a fair response.</p>
<p>In truth, the substance of the letter is irrelevant. Clearly the woman is in a lot of pain. She admits that she is basically &#8220;losing it&#8221; and it&#8217;s difficult to read the letter and not feel her suffering.</p>
<p>I have two things to say.<span id="more-7445"></span></p>
<p>The letter indicates that she desperately wants children. She doesn&#8217;t seem to care very much for a husband. According to my research this is not an uncommon sentiment. Young women who are looking to get married seem to be more focused on babies than men.</p>
<p>It could be argued that cohabitation with a male mate is just a mechanism for procreation and anything more is an unnecessary distraction. Modern people don&#8217;t think like that anymore. We view marriage as an opportunity for love. Finding a life partner has become a very important part of our culture. It didn&#8217;t happen in a vacuum either. Chazal already taught us that there must be attraction between husband and wife. It would seem like something worth looking forward to.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7446" alt="6a00d83452b15969e201910440d838970c-800wi" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/6a00d83452b15969e201910440d838970c-800wi.jpg" /></p>
<p>So why doesn&#8217;t she feel the need to find a husband? Two reasons jump out at me and both of these reasons speak to broad social issues.</p>
<p>She is reacting to what her friends are doing and talking about. Her friends talk about their kids. Her friends apparently don&#8217;t talk about their husbands. This is normal in the frum community. It&#8217;s not socially acceptable to talk about one&#8217;s spouse to others in any familiar way. If a spouse is mentioned, it&#8217;s very sterile and certainly not intimate. This is a function of tznius standards. It&#8217;s not bad per se but we can see a possible negative consequence of this strict silence on husbands and wives. It could be that single people don&#8217;t even realize that there is any beauty in a loving spousal relationship. They don&#8217;t hear about it from their friends and sometimes it can be hard to see it in one&#8217;s parents. Perhaps it would be wise to emphasize this aspect of marriage a bit more in our communities.</p>
<p>The second reason I think she may not be looking for a husband is because of the general approach toward men in the frum community. Women (and even men) are taught that men are basically animals. Women are taught (incorrectly) that they must dress modesty so that men do not sin. Men are told not to look at women because it will cause them to sin. Is it any wonder that young women are not looking forward to a relationship with one of these beasts? The discourse must change. We cannot talk about men in this way and we cannot teach tznius in a way that reinforces this negative portrayal. Maybe young women will actually want to get married for the sake of being in a relationship with a life partner.</p>
<p>The second point I want to make is that it should not be debilitating to be single. The frum community values marriage so greatly that it seems impossible to be a happy, well-adjusted, successful single woman. By broadcasting the importance of marriage, and it is important, we may also be projecting negativity toward single women. I think it would be good for our community to find a way to create a safe and productive place for single women. We should not be defining ourselves purely by marital and child bearing status. There is so much that needs to be done in our world. Single women can do so much. Minimizing them into potential baby makers is dehumanizing and we can see how it feels to be left out of the baby making party.</p>
<p>I feel for this woman. I really do. But I think we didn&#8217;t prepare her for this and we should be doing better for our singles. Being single is not a disease. It may not be ideal but it can be a great time in one&#8217;s life and great things can be accomplished. We need to figure out a way to make this happen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new issue of The New Republic cover story is about us. It is about Haredim, modern Orthodox, and women. These are things we discuss regularly online and at our Shabbos tables, and in our coffee rooms. The story is remarkably accurate and balanced, displaying a very deep understanding of the issues in Israel today. I recommend reading the article immediately.</p>
<p>Imagine a spectrum of religious fundamentalism in the orthodox Jewish community. On one end you have extreme Haredi sects and on the other end you have completely secular Israelis. On most things and for most of time the people in the middle, let&#8217;s call them modern orthodox, skewed their allegiences toward the Haredi side. Orthodoxy is the great uniter. The assumption is that any two orthodox people will have more common interests than an orthodox and a secular Jew. This is how things were.<span id="more-7442"></span></p>
<p>In essence, the article argues that while naturally aligned with their fellow orthodox Jews, women from the modern orthodox community in Israel are finding themselves aligned with secular feminist Jews in Israel. The collective pain that is felt due to the oppressiveness toward women in the extreme and not so extreme Haredi world is taking a toll. Women have been attacked physically, verbally, and psychologically for a long time and it is starting to create a negative reaction.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7443" alt="article_inset_lithwick_2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/article_inset_lithwick_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Several times the article mentions signs that tell women how to dress. We have become accustomed to these signs. But the women in the article argue that the signs give license to thugs who want to make a statement to women. To them, the signs mean much more than &#8220;Please be sensitive to our religious beliefs.&#8221; Part of that is because these standards are entering the public sphere and are no longer just limited to the private insular neighborhoods. But the other part of it is that the signs are somehow justifying the negativity and violence toward women.</p>
<p>What has happened is that women who feel hurt and abused are turning to secular and Reform Jews for salvation. Feminism is a dirty word in many orthodox communities, even in some places within the modern orthodox community. But it&#8217;s becoming a necessary evil for modern orthodox women who are not feminists at all to ask for help from feminists. It&#8217;s odd when orthodox people are funding they have more in common with secular and very liberal Jews than fellow orthodox Jews. But that is what is happening.</p>
<p>The article also talks about modern orthodox women who sympathize with the Women of the Wall. I wish they would be more vocal but i was heartened to hear it.</p>
<p>Last week I wrote about finding common ground and room for dialogue between modern orthodox and yeshivish Jews in America. (See:<br />
<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/08/02/maybe-rabbi-birnbaum-has-a-point-a-solution/">Maybe Rabbi Birnbaum Has a Point: A Solution</a>) I think what we are seeing in the article in TNR is what will happen if we can&#8217;t work together. If the people in the middle start to feel like the liberal and secular Jews are more sympathetic to their way of life, the great split that has been predicted for years, will finally happen. Modern orthodox Judaism will become an independent group.</p>
<p>Some might say, what&#8217;s so bad about that? Well there are plenty negative consequences to mention. But I will mention the two biggest issues. First, the Haredi institutions will fall without modern orthodox support. Some might say that&#8217;s not so bad either. I disagree. Their services are necessary, as is their trap door into engagement with society. On the other side, without a connection the Haredi community, the modern orthodox community will be hard pressed to support its own institutions for lack of qualified teachers and rabbis.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not in our best interests to see a formal split. It might happen in Israel and it might happen in America. I think we should do everything we can to prevent it. The first thing we need to do, is get together and talk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this week&#8217;s Yated, Rabbi Birnbaum writes a pretty offensive article aimed at the modern orthodox community. In private and public correspondence the article is being heavily criticized for its many flaws.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wish to discuss its salient points, errors, or fallacies here or anywhere else for that matter. I am not interested in debating or fighting with Yated people about the two different communities. It&#8217;s pointless and I am sick of it.</p>
<p>Instead I want to propose a solution.<span id="more-7434"></span></p>
<p>Much of the heated exchange between the yeshivish and modern orthodox communities is based on a lot of misinformation and hearsay. There is very little communication between the two groups. Rarely do the two groups work together to solve social or political issues. There are no formal forums where both communities interact in writing. Facebook is the closest thing we have to a common area for discussion and I have been blessed to host many conversations on my Facebook page where people from across the spectrum interact. But it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>In the old days we lived among one another. We shared resources. We worked together on common issues. There was a rapport. Today our respective communities are so vibrant and are thriving. We don&#8217;t need each other. We stand apart, separated by the tiniest of margins. It&#8217;s a blessing that we have become so strong as individual groups but in my mind it has caused this divide.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7435" alt="Reaching out" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/handshake.jpg" /></p>
<p>True, we disagree on a lot. We disagree about the value and power of Daas Torah. We disagree about Chazal and science. We disagree on the value of full time learning and how long it is appropriate. We disagree on the importance of fathers providing for their family. We disagree on the level of insularity. We disagree on the harms of media consumption. We disagree on Zionism. We disagree on the flexibility of some areas of halacha. We disagree on the emphasis on chumros. Yes, we disagree. But in the end, this is a minuscule fraction of what we agree upon. We agree on Torah M&#8217;Sinai. We agree on Rambam. We agree on Shulchan Aruch. We agree on R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein. We basically agree on Israel. We agree on America. We basically agree on education for children. We agree on so much.</p>
<p>Yet, as we have noted many times, when we are similar to one another we seek ways to distinguish ourselves from one another. That&#8217;s what has happened here. We&#8217;ve divided ourselves over petty matters and it&#8217;s starting to affect our midos toward each other.</p>
<p>The solution here is quite simple. People from all walks of life need to get together and talk. We need to have Shabbatons for all kinds of people to enjoy the company of one another. We need to tackle issues of common concern together. We need a formal place to talk to each other instead of about each other. I doubt Rabbi Birnbaum would have dropped his article as a comment on Ha&#8217;emtza or even on my Facebook page (although I have gotten worse). But he&#8217;s writing for Yated readers and somehow (read: the Internet) the modern orthodox community gets ahold of the article, reads it, and to them he sounds off the wall. It would be so much more productive to talk to each other rather than writing screeds on blogs or &#8220;olde tyme&#8221; blogs (newspapers) like the Yated.</p>
<p>The modern orthodox community must be able to articulate its positions from a place of strength and confidence. The yeshivish community must be able to express its positions with less bombast. Both communities must try to hear the other side. But most of all, this conversation should not be between strangers, it should be between friends.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got to figure out a way to have friends from across the spectrum of orthodox Judaism. The issues have to be personalized by the humanity of relationships.</p>
<p>If this doesn&#8217;t work and we still can&#8217;t find a way to communicate civilly and productively, I&#8217;ll try to think of something else. But in the meantime, l&#8217;maan Hashem, let&#8217;s try to do this right.</p>
<p>This is a formal invitation to engage in a round table or panel discussion on the issues that are plaguing our communities. Let&#8217;s talk to each other, not about each other.</p>
<p>I am happy to host or attend such a conversation. If you are interested, please contact me. Send this to people from both sides of this issue and let&#8217;s make it happen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parshas Ekev has the obligation to fear God. What does that mean? What about God are we supposed to fear?</p>
<p>R&#8217; Yaakov Kamenetsky asks a famous question on Rambam. In one place, Rambam says that we are supposed to fear God&#8217;s punishment. In another place Rambam says we are supposed to feat the awesomeness of God. Which is it?</p>
<p>R&#8217; Yaakov says it doesn&#8217;t matter. The mitzvah is not to fear God per se. The mitzvah is to yield the result that the fear would produce. That is, the observance of God&#8217;s commandments. The point of fearing God is to promote observance of the mitzvos. Which path of fear one uses does not matter.<span id="more-7431"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7432" alt="Thinking-Man" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Thinking-Man-600x600.jpg" /></p>
<p>Similarly, I think we can say that there is a mitzvah to believe in God. The reason one believes in God is not relevant. Whether one believes it is an obvious fact or whether one accepts it as an article of faith, it does not matter. What does matter is that one believes. The point of this belief is to encourage us to do as God tells us. That is the goal and how we get there does not matter.</p>
<p>Further, we can ask what is God&#8217;s word? There is no mitzvah that obligates us to believe that the Torah is God&#8217;s word. Rambam codifies 13 tenets of Judaism and enumerates that we must believe that the Torah is the word of God as given to Moses. R&#8217; Yaakov Weinberg explains that this is really a belief that obligates us to deny the possibilty that there will be a new absolute communication from God. The goal of the 8th according to R&#8217; Weinberg is to reinforce the eternity of Torah and that we must treat the Torah we have today as the real McCoy.</p>
<p>It could be said, taking the idea of R&#8217; Kamenetsky with regard to fear of God and the words of R&#8217; Weinberg with regard to the 8th principle that it matters very little how the words of the Torah became the words that we have today. It matters very little how close they are to the Divine Revelation or how close they are to the exact words that Moses heard from God. What matters is that we treat these words are binding and the best representation of God&#8217;s will. The point of this belief is to influence our decisions and nudge us closer toward Torah observance.</p>
<p>What I am trying to say is that if someone has a belief that is not mainstream orthodox or even if it&#8217;s an incompatible belief with typical orthodox Judaism it should not matter if that person maintains that the Torah he believes in, however it got there, is as binding as the word of God to Moses. That person will get the same results from their belief as the person who thinks that our Torah scrolls are identical to the scroll Moses wrote. Both will observe the Torah and its mitzvos. That is the point. The point is not to profess certain beliefs devoid of any context. The main thing is to do mitzvos. We have to feel that we are obligated in mitzvos. Whichever path we take to explain that obligation should matter very little.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that beliefs matter. There are halachic ramifications to erroneous belief. I think a distinction aught to be considered between one who possesses beliefs outside the pale of orthodoxy but that person still considers their beliefs to be orthodox and that person carries on as an orthodox Jew and the person who rejects the authenticity of Torah and therefore does not observe the Torah as an orthodox Jew. It&#8217;s hard to hear how a minor distinction in belief can undo all the Torah studied and mitzvos observed, especially in a religion of action as opposed to a religion of belief.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An area of intense debate has historically been whether people are born good or are born sinners or are born neither? Similarly, is our moral compass natural or is it nurtured? Questions like these have been tackled by philosophers and religions for a long time.</p>
<p>Some Christian denominations talk of Original Sin. Generally speaking, this means that Adam&#8217;s sin in the Garden of Eden caused all humans to be born with a negative impulse. This sounds like our version of the Yetzer Hara (Evil Inclination). We say a child is born with a Yetzer Hara that pulls the child in toward sin and upon reaching the age of adulthood one receives the Yetzer Tov (Good Inclination) that pulls us to be virtuous.<span id="more-7414"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7418" alt="sweet_baby" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sweet_baby-600x375.jpg" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard and often repeated an idea from R&#8217; Moti Berger that this Yetzer Hara refers to selfishness. We are born thinking about our immediate needs and desires with no appreciation for consequences to the detriment of others and even to our own personal long term detriment. This is another way of expressing the same principle.</p>
<p>Religions seem to prefer the idea that we are born with a negative tendency and our religious education and training prepare us to battle our Yetzer Hara. As we grow and learn throughout life we are expected to shrink our negative influences and increase the strength of our positive influence.</p>
<p>This afternoon I saw a R&#8217; Wolpe Tweet that referenced the video (from a few months back on 60 minutes) at the bottom of this post. R&#8217; Wolpe says:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Modern studies prove the Rabbis got human nature exactly right: we have both a good and evil inclination:  <a href="https://t.co/SF2uKx7Ra1">https://t.co/SF2uKx7Ra1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; David Wolpe (@RabbiWolpe) <a href="https://twitter.com/RabbiWolpe/statuses/361973858087084032">July 29, 2013</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I am pretty sure that Chazal talked about being born with the Yetzer Hara and being granted a Yetzer Tov later in life. So I think R&#8217; Wolpe may be incorrect on that point. But I watched the video and I think he mischaracterizes the study as well. In the end, I think the study does support Chazal&#8217;s teaching. But in the way that they actually said it.</p>
<p>The study does not show that we are born with good and evil inclinations. It shows that babies have the ability to prefer certain choices. Those preferences can be based on a toy that seems nice, or a toy that did not help a toy that is not nice, or a toy that like the same things as them. I think it actually reinforces the idea that babies are self interested creatures and they want to be around things that will serve them well. This is what Chazal said. This is supported by the study.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing here is that they can understand what it means to be nice and that they can make choices based on that. But there is no indication that babies have a good inclination. All their good choices were self serving. This is not a bad thing. Not at all. But I think it&#8217;s a fairer way of describing the findings.</p>
<p>The video explains why people make hurtful or harmful decisions as a natural result of bias. We prefer things like us or things that share our likes and we are wired to be okay with punishing those who are outside our group. This video shows that it is natural to prefer things that are similar to us and this is clearly the root of racism. The trick to eliminating racism is to teach ourselves not to see the color of a person when our minds are determining whether another person is similar or different.</p>
<p>One thing I would like clarified is how the researchers know that these are naturally occurring thoughts and feelings. It seems to me that it&#8217;s just as possible that babies are fast learners and can learn these things from the people around them.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the study shows that we learn how to be selfless and giving as we get older. I actually cried at the end of this video (around 11:30). I won&#8217;t tell you why, but I hope you feel the same way I do.</p>
<p>The video taught me that society does a good job of teaching selflessness and that we value selflessness as we mature. To me, this is the greatest thing we can teach our children. Don&#8217;t rely on society to teach this to them, but it seems that even society is getting it right. It&#8217;s hard to argue with the data here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NY Times reports that there is a religious group that is losing even some of its most committed members because of what they are finding on the Internet. Sound familiar? The group is not orthodox Judaism, rather it is the Mormons.</p>
<p>Some people are quick to point out that orthodox Judaism is suffering a similar fate. According to the narrative, people get online, they see that their religion can be challenged and that there are many other perspectives in the world, and sometimes they leave. We discussed this in the context of the chasidic world here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/22/can-judaism-survive-the-internet/">Can Judaism Survive the Internet?</a>)</p>
<p>Mormons are finding that their religion is so nascent, their beliefs are based on so many contradictions and inconsistencies, and their prophet was a less than admirably role model, that their faith is irrevocably shaken. Some leave. Others stay and want to modernize it.<span id="more-7410"></span></p>
<p>In the context of chasidic Judaism I think the comparison is somewhat fair. The lifestyle is a fairly recent innovation, the beliefs can seem contradictory at times, and for some, finding out that a shtreimel is not holy can shake their faith. The Internet might be &#8220;to blame&#8221; for those people discovering that they have options.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7411" alt="google_1674887b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/google_1674887b-600x375.jpg" /></p>
<p>But I think most people who leave and use the Internet as a tool to assist them in their journey are bothered by social issues in the community. They dislike the lifestyle, or they think the leadership is corrupt, or the allure of freedom from religion is too great. For them, the Internet is more like a lobby where they can meet likeminded people. The Internet doesn&#8217;t cause the doubt, but it helps them deal with it and sometime it helps them leave.</p>
<p>The last few days have demonstrated another Internet driven issue in orthodox Judaism.  A local issue can become a global issue. A rabbi who writes controversial things becomes international news. Further, the materials that form the substance of his controversial statements are available for anyone to read. The challenges can be found on plenty of websites. The charges of heresy can be found on several websites as well.</p>
<p>However there is a disconnect. The Internet is the great liberator of minds. Being told what to think doesn&#8217;t really work anymore. Anyone can do their own research. In fact, R&#8217; Gordimer&#8217;s original article was using data that was a week old and required a simple click to verify if it was current. Obviously people called him on it. It&#8217;s so easy to do research today. We can verify and fact check and myth bust with ease. If a yeshiva student in the Mir circa 1967 wanted to read Biblical Criticism, where would he even go? But now, it&#8217;s all available. Google is a click away. People can read it for themselves. That was the thinking behind <a href="http://thetorah.com" target="_blank">TABS</a>. Provide a safe place to read Biblical Criticism in the context of orthodox Judaism. R&#8217; Farber was trying do that. Did he go too far? Is there such a thing as too far? These are the questions being addressed across the Internet right now.</p>
<p>The point is that drawing lines in the sand while expecting skeptics to just &#8220;listen&#8221; is so 1980s. It doesn&#8217;t work anymore. People can just look at the information and make their own determination. Perhaps many of these people are not qualified to make such judgments. But that doesn&#8217;t stop them.</p>
<p>While it is laudable that Cross-Currents is trying to address this issue, in my opinion they are not addressing it at all. Instead we are being told what to think without being told why. The only why we have heard is that if we think like R&#8217; Farber there will be dire consequences. Is that sufficient? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>The Internet is not going away. The questions that R&#8217; Farber addressed will be on the Internet forever. And there are more. The best defense I have seen so far is on TABS. The reason it is the best is because is simply because it is the only defense so far. We can lament the lack of scholars in the frum community willing to address these questions in the terms they are asked. But all we have to show for it are lamentations. Still no answers or explanations.</p>
<p>From the NY Times article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Mr. Mattsson said that when he started sharing what he had learned with other Mormons in Sweden, the stake president (who oversees a cluster of congregations) told him not to talk about it to any members, even his wife and children. He did not obey: “I said to them, why are you afraid for the truth?”</em></p>
<p>We say we have the truth. We should be trying to figure out how to reconcile it with other truths, not saying &#8220;we have the truth&#8221; so loudly that we are incapable of hearing anything else.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most important discussion in orthodox Judaism right now is the pair of articles written by R&#8217; Zev Farber. The articles have been deemed heresy by R&#8217; Gordimer on Cross-Currents. If you are averse to reading anything that might touch on issues and ideas that are possibly heretical please stop reading and pick up a Nesivos Shalom or something.</p>
<p>Still here? Okay. The two articles say different things so I&#8217;d like to briefly address the <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2013/07/18/from-openness-to-heresy/" target="_blank">Cross-Currents post</a> as it relates to the &#8220;<a href="http://thetorah.com/devarim-recounting-different/" target="_blank">short article.</a>&#8221; This article went through two versions. R&#8217; Gordimer&#8217;s article used the first version which was more objectionable. R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s article was edited a full week before the article on Cross-Currents was published. I find this to be egregious. If you are going to call someone a heretic, possibly the worst thing to call an orthodox Jew, you best be sure that every detail of your case is accurate.<span id="more-7405"></span></p>
<p>The original version said this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The simplest explanation for these differences between the accounts in Exodus-Numbers and Deuteronomy is that they were penned by (at least) two different authors with different conceptions of the desert experience.</em></p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Despite sharing many details with the desert story as told in Exodus and Numbers, there is no way to make the two versions work with each other without unreasonably stretching the meaning of the texts. Whether it be the description of the scout story, the reaction of the Edomites and Moabites to Israel’s request, or the legitimacy of dwelling in the Transjordan, the two versions work with contradictory assumptions.</em></p>
<p>I can see why R&#8217; Gordimer thinks this is heresy. I don&#8217;t think it has to be as will be discussed later. But the second version is almost certainly not heresy. This is the revised version:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Despite sharing many details with the desert story as told in Exodus and Numbers, there appears to be no way to make the two versions work with each other without unreasonably stretching the meaning of the texts. The simplest literary approach is the academic one which posits multiple authors with multiple traditions. How such an approach meshes with traditionalist belief requires serious thought but it is necessary to start by recognizing the simplicity and straightforwardness of the academic approach.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7406" alt="Bible1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bible1.jpg" /></p>
<p>There is nothing remarkable about this statement. It simply states that the academic approach is simpler. Simpler is not necessarily more truthful. Thus, there is no value judgment on whether the academic approach is preferable. I hope that if this was the only thing R&#8217; Farber said, it would not have created a controversy. I hope. For this reason, I am disappointed in the Cross-Currents article.</p>
<p>However, whenever I raise this point I am reminded of the other &#8220;<a href="http://thetorah.com/torah-history-judaism-introduction/" target="_blank">long article</a>&#8221; where the heresy is stronger and harder to wiggle out of.</p>
<p>On to the second article.</p>
<p>This is R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s worldview. It is his Grand Theory of Everything. His goal is clear. R&#8217; Farber wants very badly to harmonize all the things he has taken for granted as an orthodox Jew, his adherence to halacha and social orthodoxy, with modern Biblical Criticism. This is his goal and it is important to begin with an appreciation of his assumptions.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Farber takes the challenges presented by Bible critics very seriously. It&#8217;s hard not to take them seriously. They are asking good questions. It&#8217;s true that we have &#8220;frum&#8221; answers for most of these questions and some of the questions are not so bothersome. Yet, the challenges exist.</p>
<p>The maximalist Bible critic answer is the text is not Divine. It is a text that comes from people and therefore any anomaly is understood as poor editing by a later redactor. The various writers have different agendas and their works reflect their personal biases.</p>
<p>The maximalist orthodox Jewish answer is that the text is Divine. It is a text that comes from God and therefore any anomaly is understood as part of the infinite wisdom of the Author of the Torah. The different versions of stories and laws reflect Divine intent to teach us everything we need to know.</p>
<p>There is a huge chasm between these two approaches. They share nothing other than the questions that they ask.</p>
<p>But most thinking people know that the maximalist orthodox Jewish position is untenable. No one really thinks that. The people who do are &#8220;mesorah maximalists&#8221; who will hide from the truth to support their position. The Talmud discusses the last few verses of Devarim. Chazal had a different midpoint to their Torah scrolls. Ezra reconciled the texts of several versions of Torah scrolls. Maimonides reconciled errors he found in Torah scrolls using the Aleppo Codex. Rashi had at least one discrepancy in his Torah scroll. Ibn Ezra famously said that there are twelve places in the Chumash that speak in present tense and those were not written by Moses.</p>
<p>In other words, we know that some parts of the Chumash were not spoken by God to Moses. That&#8217;s certainly acceptable in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>We also know that there is a dispute about the very nature of the book of Devarim. The Ramban says it was given word for word from God to Moses at Sinai. Others say Moses spoke these words as prophecy. Contrasted with the rest of the Chumash, it is more similar to the books of the prophets than Sefer Vayikra in this respect. The Avnei Nezer says that Devarim is a bridge between the Written Law and the Oral Law as it is Moshe&#8217;s discourse where he darshens the first four books of the Chumash.</p>
<p>The point is obvious. Devarim is treated differently by the Medieval commentators. The maximalist orthodox Jewish answer is not a reasonable position. Legitimate sources recognize this and we must recognize this as well. The question I wish to address is why. Why do we find these sort of opinions about Devarim and other scattered examples throughout the Chumash?</p>
<p>There are two possible answers. I think here we find a difference of opinion loosely based on affiliation. Charedim subscribe to one view and non-charedim subscribe to another.</p>
<p>Charedim are more apt to say that God included all aforementioned items when God gave the Torah to Moses. God told Moses to make the book of Devarim sound different. It was part of God&#8217;s plan that errors rf anachronisms creep into the text for the sake of the answers that would be given later. They were latent in the text the entire time but were waiting for the right people to reveal them.</p>
<p>Non-Charedim are more likely to take a different approach. This alternative approach holds that things may have happened after revelation and great Torah authorities used their wisdom and Torah knowledge to answer the questions in the best way they know how. This means that the issues that forced the hand of the great sages were the result of history, scribal errors, or any other circumstance that could have caused the problems. The answers are true to Torah because of the people who said them and their universal acceptance by the greater Jewish people.</p>
<p>We could say the same thing about the drashos we find in Chazal whether they be Halachic or Aggadic. One way of looking at it is that these drashos were latent in the text, they were always there, they were always kept, they were just &#8220;revealed&#8221; by the various tanaim and amoraim. The other view is that these drashos were Chazal&#8217;s way of dealing with textual and perhaps social or religious issues. They could have learned differently, but they chose to learn this way. The drashos that gained consensus became Torah. This approach certainly rings true when studying the Talmud.</p>
<p>Why did one opinion in the Talmud say that the last verses in Devarim were not written by Moses? Because he had a mesorah? Or was it simply the easiest solution to a very obvious problem? I think it is more elegent to sat that he saw a problem and this was his solution. To say otherwise means that at some point the mesorah was lost and a disagreement developed and the rabbis were merely reporters of their tradition as opposed to Torah giants with ideas of their own.</p>
<p>It is possible that the version I ascribe to more charedi orthodox Jews is correct. But I don&#8217;t think it is correct. It&#8217;s hard to believe that Chazal came along and just explained what was already known to everyone. But even if the charedi version is correct with regard to Chazal, it is almost certainly not correct with regard to the rishonim.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard people say that Rashi on Chumash is a semi-prophetic work. Rashi was Divinely inspired to comment on each verse and his commentary reflects God&#8217;s intended interpretation of the verses. This is a disservice to Rashi. It seems to me that Rashi saw inconsistencies or anomolies in the text and he chose his preferred interpretations from his vast knowledge of Chazal&#8217;s teachings. Rashi saw a problem and Rashi provided the solution.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s easier to see where this is taking us by looking at Ibn Ezra and Rambam. Why did the Ibn Ezra say that there are 7 places in the Chumash that are not original to the text? Was it something handed down to him from his teachers? I don&#8217;t think so. I am fairly certain that Ibn Ezra saw a problem in the text, there was evidence that contravened the accepted (or maybe it wasn&#8217;t accepted at that time) wisdom that every word of the Torah was given to Moses by God and those were the exact same words they had in the 11th century Torah scrolls. His solution was to accept the evidence and change the dogma. Religion cannot contradict truth so Ibn Ezra adjusted the religion accordingly.</p>
<p>Rambam managed to make the Torah consistent with Greek and Arabic philosophy. Do we think that Rambam thought that Greek and Arabic philosophy were handed to Moses from God at Sinai? That&#8217;s preposterous. Rather, Rambam held that the maxims he accepted in those non-Jewish sources were the truth. If they are true, then the Torah must work with Greek and Arabic philosophy. Rambam made it work. It&#8217;s the same idea. Rambam accepted external evidence and then conformed the Torah to make sense in the context of his truth. Truth cannot be changed. But sometimes religious dogma can be changed. Even more surprising is that Rambam did not say &#8220;prove Greek and Arabic philosophy to me and then I will work out the Torah but until then I accept the Torah as truth and all this secular stuff is obviously wrong.&#8221; He simply accepted the secular wisdom as true and conformed Torah to that truth.</p>
<p>This is how the rishonim and Chazal dealt with Torah vs. evidence.</p>
<p>Similarly, when both Chazal and rishonim encountered a verse or section that seemed too unlikely to be literal, they interpreted it metaphorically. We don&#8217;t circumcise our hearts because that verse was deemed allegorical. Rishonim, like Ralbag and Rambam went even further by turning sections that contradicted their common sense into dream-sequences or metaphors. Many rishonim and even some achronim have done the same thing with difficult passages in the Talmud. If it can&#8217;t be explained literally because of evidence then it could be allegorized. (Granted, some achronim felt no pangs of guilt by simply saying that Chazal were incorrect.)</p>
<p>The point to all this is to demonstrate how things have changed. The achronim lived in a time where science and other evidence was used to counter religion, not bolster it. In turn, they began the trend of lifting religion above the fray and arguing that the science or other evidence must be reinterpreted to fit religion. If it could not reinterpreted, it was wrong. This is the paradigm of almost all religions since the Renaissance and Enlightenment. There were exceptions to this rule, but for the most part this rule has held firm for several hundred years. Evolution doesn&#8217;t seem to fit in with Biblical narratives? Despite much more evidence than there is for the erroneous astronomy Rambam used in the Mishneh Torah, religious people all over the world are fighting against evolution. The Bible seems to be a composite work? Religious people reply that it&#8217;s impossible. Chazal seemed to be mistaken about medicine or science or math? Our modern thinking must be wrong, or alternatively the Talmud meant something else, or alternatively nature has changed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s such a different attitude from the way Torah scholars approached evidence for almost 2000 years.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t learn Chumash the same way the rishonim learned Chumash. Instead we learn what the rishonim said about the Chumash. This handicaps us from being too innovative on the one hand and has a way of maintaining tradition on the other hand.</p>
<p>I believe, what R&#8217; Farber is trying to do is to relaunch the ancient way of studying Chumash. How would Chazal or some of the rishonim reacted to the evidence presented by Biblical Criticism? If they were consistent, I believe they would have done something like R&#8217; Farber has done in his long article. I am not commenting on R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s academically leaning conclusions. There are other conclusions that could be reached by the questions raised. But his version is certainly a valid conclusion, especially when one only takes the academic data and for the sake of argument ignores the religious approach.</p>
<p>In his long article R&#8217; Farber allegorizes some things. Other things are seen as products of editing over time. We have seen that allegorization is an acceptable form of interpretation. We have also seen that it was obvious that to Chazal and rishonim that the text of the Torah had been edited. R&#8217; Gordimer and others take issue with both of these devices.</p>
<p>Allegorizing too much of the text could create a problem for people. It might be seen as cannibalizing the Torah. If the narratives are not literal then are they meaningful? R&#8217; Farber says yes. Others seem to say no. I don&#8217;t see a reason to say no. I only see a fear of what might happen if we say no. R&#8217; Farber is trying to lay the groundwork for allegorization not to be a problem.</p>
<p>As to the issue of subsequent editing of the Torah I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s a huge problem. R&#8217; Farber is not saying that random people came around and edited the Torah. I think R&#8217; Farber is saying that the edits were made by prophets. The same way we take the works of the prophets seriously and we take them as divine books, we can take edits to the Bible. Our Tanach is filled with various voices that sound very different. Sometimes these books contradict one another. But it&#8217;s okay because we know that they all came from God and God speaks through each prophet in a different way. If prophets did the same thing to the Torah, it&#8217;s true that this would be a very different way of looking at Torah, but in the end, it&#8217;s just as binding on us. It&#8217;s equally the word of God. <a href="http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6372&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=90" target="_blank">There is a rishon</a> who says something like this with regard to the stories in the Torah.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s approach completely changes what we mean by Torah M&#8217;Sinai as well. But is the belief in our version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai a necessary belief for orthodox Judaism to work? Perhaps not.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s worldview is the articulation of how Revelation and Torah M&#8217;Sinai works. Professor Tamar Ross makes an attempt at this, and I don&#8217;t think it satisfactory (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/12/torah-msinai-according-to-professor-tamar-ross/">Torah M’Sinai According to Professor Tamar Ross</a> ) R&#8217; Farber articulates his beliefs at the end of the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe in Torah Min Ha-Shamayim, that the Torah is from heaven, and that the entirety of the book is nevua (prophecy) and represents the encounter between God and the people of Israel.</li>
<li>I believe in Torah mi-Sinai, meaning the uniqueness of the Torah as being of a higher order than any other work in its level of divine encounter. The story of the revelation at Sinai in the Torah I understand as a narrative depiction of a deeper truth—the Torah is God’s book and the divine blueprint for Israel and Jewish life.</li>
<li>I believe that the Torah is meant to be as it is today and that all of its verses, from “Timnah was a concubine” (Gen. 36:12) to “I am the Lord your God,” are holy.</li>
<li>I believe that halakha and Jewish theology must develop organically from Torah interpretation and not by excising or ignoring any part of the Torah or Chazal’s interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p>They sound pretty safe and pretty reasonable. But I also think that this kind of Torah M&#8217;Sinai is too nuanced to catch on and it sounds too heretical to gain traction.</p>
<p>It seems to me that R&#8217; Farber is trying to use orthodox principles to push orthodox Judaism into a discussion about our sacred texts.</p>
<p>If this is what R&#8217; Farber is doing, and I am pretty sure it is, we can say that he has good intentions. We can also say that it deserves a conversation and not to be shot down as heretical immediately. I was particularly upset that the article on Cross-Currents did not articulate the objections to R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s statements. Instead quotes were mined and the audience was expected to simply conclude that the statements were heretical. It is symptomatic of a larger problem in orthodox Judaism where reason and debate are stifled. Dogmatic proclamations are very much in style. Well argued responsa died with R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein.</p>
<p>Purely for the sake of honest religious debate, I think that R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s approach demands a discussion and not condemnation. But for the social reasons I think there is even more benefit to an inclusive approach. We should not be rooting for a breakaway from orthodoxy by the Left, nor should we even give the appearance of rooting for it. One thing that Yeshiva Chovevei Torah and its community do well, is inclusivity. The times we live in are dark in some ways, but people are more capable than ever before to think on their own and formulate their judgments. I see no benefit to jettisoning an entire group of people and the people who are sympathetic to them because of controversial statements. I am aware that this is a time-honored custom of Jews and religious people everywhere. I just don&#8217;t see the utility in it anymore. Our best defense against losing the battle vs. complete secularism is not insularity and narrowing the playing field. Our best defense is the exact opposite.</p>
<p>If we want to have a small narrow-minded cult that ignores the outside world and in turn is ignored by the outisde world we should continue the trend of ousting people and movements from orthodox Judaism. If we want to keep a foothold in the outside world and carry weight and influence in a world that could certainly use some of our wisdom, we need to keep the broadest base possible.</p>
<p>I hope that R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s article and the entire theTorah.com website can become a springboard for education and discussion. Inclusivity to the maximum should be our goal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Cross-posted at <a href="https://medium.com/p/384410654ced" target="_blank">Medium</a></em></p>
<p>In the old days, when it was still cool to be a racist, people felt superior to other people because of the color of their skin. A white person was automatically better, smarter, more worthy than a non-white person and the average white person thought this was acceptable. This resulted in slavery, segregation, vigilante justice, and the dehumanization of black people.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have progressed as a society to the point where that kind of thinking is abhorrent and is considered wrong. That’s the good news.</p>
<p>However, we have also spawned a new form of racism. This is a much more subtle racism but equally nefarious.<span id="more-7398"></span></p>
<p>In the wake of the George Zimmerman trial we have seen strong reactions from some members of the black community decrying the lack of justice for Trayvon Martin. There is an equally strong counter-reaction explaining that it’s okay to suspect black people of crimes because the statistics support suspicion. This latter group are the modern racists.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7399" alt="6122894190_64c17ede01_b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6122894190_64c17ede01_b-600x488.jpg" />The statistics show that black people commit a higher proportion of crimes than white people. Leaving aside the difficulties presented by the bias of selective enforcement and selective prosecution, I argue that using these statistics at all is an example of modern racism.A statistic is only meaningful if the data being used is a factor in the conclusion. For example, (and this is completely fictional) if I were to show that the majority of red haired women possesed below average intelligence, that statistic would not be meaningful unless I showed a causation between hair color and inferior intelligence. If I can’t show that, the statistic is meaningless. Even if the statistic is “true” it still doesn’t tell me anything about other red haired women. It just means that red haired people are not a significant group with enough specific traits to be classsified as a group with particular characteristics and predictable tendencies.</p>
<p>Categorizing all black people as one large group where the acts of one black person in Florida somehow tell us something about a different black person in Seattle is racist. Even within the same community it can be offensive to group people together because they share a skin tone. If the only thing two people share is skin tone then we cannot make any meaningful inferences from one person’s behavior to the other person’s behavior.</p>
<p>If we make judgments for the entire arbitrarily created group, we are being racists. There is no reason that the act of a black man in Texas should mean more about the potential acts of a black man in Michigan than his acts should inform us about a a white Norwegian woman or an indigenous Korean man. The only reason to connect the imaginary dots between all people of color is because there is a fallacious assumption that all people of color share some attribute that makes what one black person does meaningful in the analysis of what another will do. This is racist.</p>
<p>It’s not racist in the old fashioned lynch mob way. But it is still racist to presume one knows things about one black person simply because another black person or group of black people act a certain way.</p>
<p>I find that this is a very difficult concept for some people. These people clearly think that there actually is a black predisposition toward illegal or dangerous activity.</p>
<p>We must not tolerate that kind of thinking in 2013.</p>
<p>I’m looking at you <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/black-americas-real-problem-isnt-white-racism-070000529.html" target="_blank">Pat Buchanan</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a great article in the NY Times last week about nostalgia. I believe that nostalgia is a very important element of the religious experience. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/03/21/the-magical-secret-of-the-seder/">The Magical Secret of the Seder</a>)</p>
<p>I had no idea that until recently nostalgia was considered a mental disorder. Apparently, it was thought to be akin to depression. But people who were nostalgic were not sad and so research commenced to determine the proper classification and function of nostalgia.</p>
<p>It turns out that nostalgia is actually pretty useful. Studies have shown that nostalgia can make people feel happier, can physically warm the body, can give people hope, and overall improve one&#8217;s life. This all serves very important evolutionary purposes. Modernly, it helps with relationships in general and in particular with marriage. Good memories make for good relationships.<span id="more-7393"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7394" alt="V7K1cJRPaafgLZP" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/V7K1cJRPaafgLZP-600x450.jpg" /></p>
<p>Looking at nostalgia through the lens of the religious person, nostalgia becomes even more useful. If our religion gives us good memories and makes us feel good when we are young it is going to be important to us to relive those memories year to year and life event to life event. Even more importantly, it motivates us to give our children similar experiences. We want our children to look fondly upon their youth and we want religion to be front and center in their positive memories.</p>
<p>I think we should cultivate good memories. We should create our own nostalgia. We should actively mine those memories for good feelings towards people, family, spouses, and of course religion. Jewish holidays are perfect for this kind of work but really it should be a full time effort.</p>
<p>All this leads me to two issues that are plaguing the orthodox Jewish community right now.</p>
<p>Victims of sex abuse invoke many coping mechanisms to deal with the betrayal and violence of the crimes perpetrated against them. Obviously, if the abuser is an authority or religious figure, the victim&#8217;s associations with religion become supremely negative. There is little religious nostalgia for victims. Even worse, is when the coping mechanism involves repressing memories of one&#8217;s childhood. Some victims cannot even remember their childhood. Clearly, these victims have no nostalgia towards their religion. They may stay in the fold for other reasons, but an important part of their religious experience is left with a gaping hole instead of positive memories. Aside from robbing children of their innocence and inflicting untold pain of their victims, predators paint over their victim&#8217;s childhood memories with a very big, very dark brush. This has many negative consequences, including religious consequences.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have witnessed there is a recent spate of <i>baalei teshuva </i>returning to their prior lives and leaving orthodox Judaism. This group also lacks the nostalgia of an orthodox Jewish upbringing. This is not a defect. It can be a difference that does not make a distinction. But for some people, it can be hard to stay in the orthodox Jewish community and for some of those people nostalgia is a decent motivating factor. Unfortunately, those who choose to become orthodox later in life lack this secret weapon. Sometimes that can make all the difference in the world between staying or leaving.</p>
<p>The article in the NY Times corroborates what I think is a very underappreciated part of being an orthodox Jew. Nostalgia. Those who are missing it, whether because of despicable violence or courage to choose orthodox Judaism are often missing this non-essential ingredient. But we all have the power to give it to our children and I contend that it&#8217;s a very worthwhile endeavor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The biggest challenge we have on Tisha B&#8217;Av is relating to its sadness. Our Judaism is so upbeat and so positive that it can be hard to find the inner strength to be sad on this day. We are more Slabodka than Navardhok. We are more Chasidishe than Litvishe. We are more Mesillas Yesharim than Shaarei Teshuva.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s contemporary Judaism. Asceticism is out. Joyful service is in. Eating is the new fasting.</p>
<p>As such, it can be difficult to muster the requisite sadness and appropriate mood for Tisha B&#8217;Av. I struggle with this every year and I know many others who do as well.</p>
<p>Since the time around last Tisha B&#8217;Av I have been stuyding and teaching Daf Yomi. I think that the daily Talmudic study may have a secret that can inform our Tisha B&#8217;Av experience this year.<span id="more-7384"></span></p>
<p>One of the beautiful things about studying Talmud is appreciating the way the text immerses you in the conversation. The reader is not a passive bystander. The reader is an active participant in the discussion. Sometime we are the Tanna Kamma. Then we are the voice of the Gemara that challenges that Tanna. Then we become the the various Amoraim who answer these challenges. All along the way we take on the persona and logical faculties of the speaker in the text. One second you&#8217;re R&#8217; Yehoshua, the next second you&#8217;re R&#8217; Elazar, the next minute you are Abaye, and immediately thereafter you are Rava. We read their words and we strive to understand their thinking.</p>
<p>I find this exhilarating. Every other book I have read or studied tells you what to think. The Talmud asks you to join along in thinking with it.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7385" alt="Religious Jews Mark The Anniversary Of The Destruction Of The Temple Of Solomon" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6c3d94e69c3621fb25789283f4103745.jpg" /></p>
<p>This Tisha B&#8217;Av we can try to do the same thing with the Tisha B&#8217;Av liturgy. We hear the haunting intonations of Eicha. Instead of trying to feel pain that is so fleeting for us today, let&#8217;s try to empathize with the pain of Jeremiah. His pain leaps off the page. Can we hear the agony in his words? Can we step into his shoes and experience his torment?</p>
<p>We can do the same thing we read the Kinos. They are obscure and arcane. But they can also give us a window into the hearts and minds of their composers. When we read the poetic dirges written centuries ago we must transport ourselves to that day in history. We must try to feel what they are feeling when they wrote these searing laments. We may not be able to feel our own pain, but we can all empathize with our ancestors and feel their pain.</p>
<p>I propose that we treat the Tisha B&#8217;Av liturgy the way we treat the Talmud. We read the lines of the Talmud and we put ourselves in the place of their speaker. We can do the same thing on Tisha B&#8217;Av. We can become Jeremiah, we can become HaKalir, we can live Eicha and the Kinos vicariously.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we feel their pain, it will awaken the dormant pain in our hearts this Tisha B&#8217;Av. And maybe if we awaken that latent pain found deep in the recesses our soul, we will merit to have that pain replaced with the joy of a time when Tisha B&#8217;Av is a day of celebration and no longer a day of mourning.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angered, and swore, saying: Surely there shall not one of these men, even this evil generation, see the good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers. […] Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying: Thou also shalt not go in either;” &#8211; Deuteronomy 1:34-35, 37</em></p>
<p>Moses spend his final days exhorting the Israelites to follow the word of G-d. In addition to his encouragement, Moses reminds the Israelites of their short history and the events that brought them to this juncture on the banks of the Jordan River about to enter the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>The book begins with a recap of the story of the spies. Moses fills in some of the blanks in the story in this retelling of the tale. The people are reminded that none of the sinners from the incident would be entering the Land of Israel. Interestingly, Moses includes himself in those who would not be entering the Promised Land due to the sin of the spies.<span id="more-7376"></span></p>
<p>The problem is that the Torah tells us in Parshas Chukas that Moses would not enter the Land of Israel because of his sin at Mei Meriva. When Moses was supposed to draw water from a rock by speaking to it he sinned and that is the reason he was banned from the land. It was not because of the spies. What are we to make of these remarks by Moses? Why is he saying he won’t be going to Israel as a punishment for the incident with the spies?<img class="size-medium wp-image-7377 alignright" alt="Moses_Pleading_with_Israel" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Moses_Pleading_with_Israel-437x600.jpg" width="437" height="600" /></p>
<p>Throughout the sojourn in the desert, the Israelites doggedly complained to Moses. They were relentless. If it wasn’t water, it was bread. If it wasn’t bread, it was meat. If it wasn’t meat, it was vegetables. There was always something to complain about. Indeed, the Israelites logged numerous complaints to Moses.</p>
<p>R’ Schwab says that if we look at all the complaints, we notice that they all shared one common thread. The people repeatedly accused Moses of taking them out of Egpyt to die in the desert. They asked time after time “Why have you taken us out of Egypt?”</p>
<p>The essence of this complaint is that Moses was a rebel leader who decided on his own to flee Egypt. The people were blaming Moses for their circumstances. In order for this complaint to make sense the assumption must be that Moses was not following G-d’s word, rather he was doing as he pleased. When he was caught in a bind, the people called him on his supposed recklessness.</p>
<p>During the incident of the spies, the people complained to Moses. They said: And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them: &#8216;Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would we had died in this wilderness! &#8211; Number 14:2</p>
<p>It is the familiar canard. Moses was to blame for their troubles with the spies as well.</p>
<p>This despite the baselessness for their accusation. Moses was acting upon the word of G-d. He had no say in the itinerary. He was as much a passenger on the journey as the rest of the people. But still, he was being blamed. Worse, he was being accused of acting on his own accord and thus he was culpable.</p>
<p>Human nature is such that hearing something over and over again for forty years will inevitably have an impact on the person. It’s impossible for it not to make an impression on the person’s psyche. It’s not quite brainwashing, but it’s a similar principle. When we are told a lie so many times over the course of so many years it begins to wear on us. We start to think that it might even be true. We start to believe the negative publicity.</p>
<p>Maybe Moses heard these accusations so many times over the course of the last 40 years that he started giving them some credence. Their accusation that he did things on his own without the approval of G-d took it’s toll. He started to think that maybe he was doing things on his own.</p>
<p>That is why he hit the rock instead of talking to the rock. Moses made the colossal error of thinking that he was the one doing the decision making and not G-d. Subconsciously, he decided to hit the rock to do it his own way. For this he was punished.</p>
<p>Now, while recounting the story of the spies and the accusation that he was a lone ranger acting without G-d’s approval Moses tells the people how much he was affected by their complaints. He tells the Israelites that their constant complaining had an effect on him and when he hit the rock part of it was because of what the Israelites had been saying to him for all those years.</p>
<p>The reason Moses was punished was because he hit the rock. But maybe the reason he hit the rock was because of the sort of complaints he had been subject to for 40 years. Case in point, the sin of the spies and the accusations and insults which accompanied the incident. Moses was told too many times that he was a renegade leader. Eventually his mind fooled him into believing it, if only for just a millisecond. But the damage was done. Moses hit the rock. Thus Moses mentions that he has been punished and will not be entering the Land of Israel while recounting the story of the spies.</p>
<p>In our lives we hear a lot about ourselves. Our parents and teachers tell us what they think about us. Friends and acquaintances make us aware of their opinions. Bosses and co-workers may express their feelings about us. Spouses and children tell us all that we need to know about ourselves. What they say might be true, it might not be true, but it definitely makes a difference.</p>
<p>We have to place ourselves in situations where we hear the right things about ourselves. Too much praise or too much criticism can make a real impression on our own thoughts about ourselves. Whether it artificially inflates our sense of self-worth, or if it artificially deflates our self-confidence, what other say about us makes a difference. It is wise for us to consider our social environment and analyze how we are being talked about in our daily lives.</p>
<p>Conversely, we have a huge responsibility to think about what we say about others. When it comes to our children, we have so much to say about them. Are we critical? Are we honest about their failings? Do they hear how much we love them? Do they hear how proud we are of their accomplishments? Do they hear a barrage of criticism? Do they get reminded of their shortcomings or negative personality quirks regularly?</p>
<p>We have so much power over what our children think of themselves. It would be wise for us to maximize their feelings of confidence and imbue them with an honesty about rising up to their challenges. What we say about them in person and what they hear us say about them will make a very big difference in the way they think about themselves.</p>
<p>The Jewish people as a whole are routinely discussed in the public arena. They say we are too much or this, or too little of that. We hear Jews being talked about it all the time. We read descriptions of Jewish people or Jewish ideas. Hearing lies over and over will take a toll on our collective psyche. We need to be sure that we do not believe everything we hear about ourselves. We cannot allow negativity dictate our communal mood.</p>
<p>It can be hard to stonewall what we hear about us as a group or as individuals. But being aware of the potential harm in believing our own publicity is the first step in avoiding it.</p>
<p>Above all, we cannot neglect our incredible opportunity to positively shape how others think about themselves. There is no part of our lives that this is more important that how we deal with our children and spouses. Let us use this knowledge to shower those closest to us with love, affection, positivity, and honesty. <em>- Good Shabbos</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rabbi Louis Jacobs was an orthodox rabbi in the early 20th century. He was orthodox until he wasn&#8217;t. Professor Alan Brill chronicles the demise of Jacobs and how he diverged from prior orthodox positions and adopted liberal positions that were reserved for the non-orthodox.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate for orthodox Judaism that Jacobs and his contributions were lost to orthodox Judaism. I think we would be better off today had Jacobs toed the line and stayed within the bounds of orthodoxy. He was a great thinker and we nearly had the benefit of his thinking in orthodox Judaism.<span id="more-7368"></span></p>
<p>In short, Jacobs accepted elements of Biblical Criticism to the extent that his view could not be reconciled with any version of orthodox Judaism. According to Brill, Jacobs believed that much of the text of the Bible was not dictated to Moses. He believed that the origins of Judaism were not relevant rather the evolved Judaism of the 20th century was key. Eventually he went so far as to say that the Bible was written by humans.<img class="size-full wp-image-7369 alignright" alt="09jacobs_190" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/09jacobs_190.jpg" width="190" height="257" /></p>
<p>This placed him firmly outside the camp of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>But the real tragedy is what Brill says at the end of his post. Before Jacobs, orthodox Judaism had been developing an acceptable version of dealing with Biblical Criticism. Rabbis like Rabbi J.H. Hertz and Rabbi Isidore Epstein had previously acknowledged that while there was a revelation at Sinai, some parts of the Torah either predated Sinai and were including by incorporation or that some edits may have been made after Sinai. Their  views allowed some human element to the Bible.</p>
<p>The view of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein are significant. Both were orthodox rabbis and nevertheless were able to assert that there was a human element to the Bible.</p>
<p>However, Brill asserts that after Jacobs was ousted from orthodox Judaism for his newfound heretical views, the previously acceptable opinions of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein were given the pink slip as well. The approach to Biblical Criticism that developed in the wake of the Jacobs fiasco was so rigid that the somewhat flexible views of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein were no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>I think this is unfortunate. Orthodox Jews are expected to believe in the most rigid form of Torah M&#8217;Sinai. It is more rigid that the accepted beliefs of great orthodox rabbis from all across the timeline of Jewish history. Is it all because of Jacobs? Maybe. It certainly fits historically.</p>
<p>So while it is a shame that we lost Jacobs, in essence we have also lost Rabbis Hertz and Epstein. This is an even greater tragedy. They were orthodox and now their views are widely considered unorthodox.</p>
<p>But would it not be helpful to 2013 Judaism to allow their opinions back into the fold? I think it would. Absolute Torah M&#8217;Sinai can be a greater challenge than believing in God or in the power of Chazal to create obligation to contemporary orthodox Jews. Perhaps having a more flexible version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai that is consistent with historical orthodox Judaism would be of great use to frum skeptics everywhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was invited to join Rabbi Shafran to talk about recent comments by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks and the subsequent response by the Agudah. We discussed it on Facebook on Friday and I guess Zev or one of his producers saw the comment thread and decided to ask me onto the show. The format of the show was to be a moderated discussion between Rabbi Shafran and me.<span id="more-7357"></span></p>
<p>Rabbi Shafran represented the Agudah position. I represented the non-Agudah position.<img class="size-medium wp-image-7358 alignright" alt="old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The gist of Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s argument was that Rabbi Sacks was criticizing a legitimate form of orthodox Judaism and was doing so from a place of ignorance as evidenced by his mention of the Siyum HaShas as an example of inward turning segregationism. Thus, the Agudah was standing up for themselves and the more insular communities who were criticized.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the Agudah over reacted. Rabbi Sacks was not even criticizing the insular communities as much as he was warning of a potential danger if the trend to the right continues. In his view, and in mine, there is a lot of value in a version of Judaism that sympathizes with orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Judaism should be careful not to eliminate this soft center between non-orthodox Judaism and orthodox Judaism. While the choice of the Siyum HaShas was unfortunate, I don&#8217;t think it accurately reflected his sentiments.</p>
<p>Regardless of what Rabbi Sacks meant, this is an important discussion and I invited Rabbi Shafran and the radio audience to have that discussion. While it is entertaining to argue about what Rabbi Sacks was trying to say, it is far less important than the substance his point.</p>
<p>Listen to the show below. I&#8217;ve cut the 2 hour show into 1:20 of just talking. So no ads or news will disturb your listening. The quality of the recording is pretty brutal but this was what I received from the producer.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meditation was once an oddity reserved for spiritual extremists. Today, meditation is as American as apple pie.</p>
<p>There are many good reasons to do meditation. The NY Times enumerates several of the benefits that have been demonstrated by science. Improved leadership and productivity can be attributed to meditation.</p>
<p>Meditation has a place in Judaism as well. Many great Jewish thinkers have described Jewish prayer as a form of meditation. The prophets of yore achieved their heightened spiritual state after intense meditation. There are pious chasidic men (and maybe some women) who meditate alone in the Jerusalem Forest on a regular basis. For us, meditation is a word to describe an activity whose end is to achieve some state of nirvana. It could even be argued that making blessings before eating food or enjoying any other physical pleasure is a variation of mindfulness.<span id="more-7348"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7349 alignright" alt="meditation-6" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/meditation-6-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The NY Times reports that there is a reason that Buddha favored meditation. Buddha&#8217;s teachings were to end suffering. Meditation was intended to serve as a way of freeing one&#8217;s mind of the negative thoughts we have about others. The idea was to bring people together through the heightened state of awareness.</p>
<p>This is a lofty claim and it was put to the test by the author of the NY Times article, profesor of psychology Dr. David DeSteno. He and his lab conducted controlled experiments to determine if meditation had an impact on empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>The results? Incredibly, or maybe not, meditation actually helped a significant portion of test subjects feel empathetic. It works!</p>
<p>DeSteno concludes that while the fringe benefits are great, when one meditates one should be mindful of its original purpose. Hopefully if we can channel that power we can alleviate the pain of division and hate.</p>
<p>I can think of no message more appropriate for Rosh Chodesh Av. This time of year we are exhorted to work on our interpersonal skills. Perhaps it would be wise to spend some time in meditation to give ourselves an assist on this seasonal challenge.</p>
<p>The article also got me thinking about doing Mitzvos to reap the social benefits of the act or even to reap an alternative benefit that was certainly unintended. Sometimes people lament the new-agey interpretations of Mitzvos and modern understandings of their social benefits. True, it can feel uncomfortable, but I think it&#8217;s noteworthy that we find similar hand wringing with regard to meditation. DeSteno is a bit uncomfortable with using meditation to get ahead instead of using it to unite. I think we can relate to that.</p>
<p>Finally, one can imagine how vindicated followers of Buddha must feel. As orthodox Jews, we feel the same way some our traditions and teachings are corroborated by modern discoveries. I know I love when that happens, so I am sure the study mentioned in this article will bring similar feelings of euphoria to students of Buddha.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Things look a little different around here, don&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>The blog is built on a new theme that is designed for modern devices and places a premium on ease of reading. The content of the post is the most important thing on the blog and I wanted the content to be king. There is just one sidebar that has some basic information and links to more informative pages. The sidebar can be hidden by toggling the arrow on the upper left hand corner. To go to the home page just click the logo on top of the sidebar.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added a floating share bar to make it easy to share what you are reading. Whether you agree of disagree, I think sharing blog posts and articles is a great way to generate discussion and either express appreciation or dissatisfaction with a particular post. We also have Facebook and Twitter follow buttons so newcomers can easily connect with me on social media.</p>

Seeing as this year the 4th of July is during the 3 Weeks between Shiva Asar B&#8217;Tamuz and Tisha B&#8217;Av there are some elements of mourning that are customary during this period. Many orthodox Jews refrain from listening to music as part of their mourning these 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Fireworks are often accompanied by music. Journalist Menachem Wecker was curious if the music accompaniment would cause some orthodox Jews to forgo the usual fireworks celebrations.</p>
<p>There are probably very few orthodox Jews who care about July 4th who also would be so stringent about the 3 weeks that they would not even listen to background music. Of those who are that stringent, very few would care to participate in July 4th festivities.<span id="more-7318"></span></p>
<p>Are there any orthodox Jews who will avoid places that have music in the background? What do they do if they get put on hold? Radio advertisement jingles? Cell phone ring tones? Singing toddler toys? That <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQT9K_nkeVQ" target="_blank">awesome music that plays when you start Windows 2000</a>? Obviously these questions are absurd. The real prohibition is against live music and celebration. Most orthodox Jews extend that to recored music as well. But I don&#8217;t think there are many people who avoid music at all costs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I told Menachem Wecker when he talked with me about this issue and then I was quoted in his article.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the headline though. It kind of says the opposite of what the article says.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, if a July 4th celebration would interfere with one&#8217;s observance of the appropriate level of mourning at this time of year, I think one should make their own decision to refrain from celebrating. I don&#8217;t that would apply to many people, but out first allegiance is to Torah, then and only then do we pledge allegiance to the flag.</p>
<p>Enjoy the holiday. Happy birthday America!</p>

The topic was this: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/30/great-idea-terrible-execution/">Great Idea, Terrible Execution</a>.</p>
<p>My shul is in a place that might be more diverse than anywhere else in the world. My worldview is the complete opposite from the worldview of insular chasidic Jews in Monsey. So perhaps the idea was to use my experience in Venice to brainstorm ways to nudge the insular community towards a bit more tolerance and integration.</p>
<p>We were joined by Reverend Weldon McWilliams IV who has become the face of the Wake Up Rockland activist group. He is a wonderful fellow and I enjoyed our time together.</p>
<p>It was an interesting conversation and does dovetail into a passion of mine. Helping people and communities understand one another is very important to me and I hope that our conversation today can be the start of a journey toward more unity in Monsey.</p>

<p><em>Write an article about modesty that is respectful to men and women, makes a case for an orthodox Jewish version of tznius, and it also has to make tznius sound pleasant.</em></p>
<p>Can I do it? This is my attempt.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of <i>tznius</i> in orthodox Judaism. The first is the concept of modesty. The second is the details of how <i>tznius</i> is observed in orthodox Judaism. I admit that it is much easier to make a case for the first aspect than it is for the second. But I submit that once one is convinced of the first aspect, the second aspect becomes much easier. But I am hopeful that we can carve out a third aspect to <i>tznius</i>, if not in practice yet, at least in theory.</p>
<p>The Sefer HaChinuch asks an excellent question. There is a mitzvah to kindle the fire of the altar in the Temple. A priest would light the fire every day. If the Temple needs a fire, someone has to to light it. The problem is that we have a tradition that the fire on the altar came from heaven and thus there was no need for a mere mortal to light the fire.</p>
<p><span id="more-7298"></span></p>
<p>Answers the Sefer HaChinuch, this is the way of God. Whenever God acts in a miraculous way that displays God&#8217;s greatness, God will seek to hide God&#8217;s greatness and make the miracle appear to be natural. There will always be a way to rationalize the miracle as a non-miracle. This explains the requirement that a priest light the fire on the altar. It must appear that God is not acting in a way that is clearly miraculous.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s reasonable to say that God&#8217;s &#8220;moment&#8221; in the Bible was the splitting of the Sea of Reeds. That was the bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, down by three runs, and God hits it out of the park for the win. It&#8217;s the defining moment in our relationship with God until this very day and one of the most dramatic episodes in the Bible. It&#8217;s very interesting to note what is recorded in the Torah before the sea actually split. We are told that Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and strong winds stirred up the sea water all night. The next day God split the sea.</p>
<p>The Chinuch explains that God&#8217;s miracles must be hidden. God could have been a show-off and designed this big moment to be as dramatic as possible. The waters could have been completely still, Moses could have been crying on his hands and knees begging for mercy, and then God would swoop in at the last possible moment and save the Israelites with a grand show. But instead God hid the miracle behind outstretched arms and swirling winds.</p>
<p>This is the way of our God. Our God is modest. Even our all powerful God chooses to limit God&#8217;s exposure when performing miracles. The Chinuch concludes that this is true greatness. One who is great is not one who needs to make a show of oneself. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Jewish modesty. <em>V&#8217;halachta b&#8217;drachav</em>. We emulate God&#8217;s character. <em>V&#8217;hatzneah leches im Elokecha</em>. Walk modestly with your God.</p>
<p>Every person should strive to be Godly. Greatness is found when people don&#8217;t expose everything. This is the paradigm that we learn from God. Overexposure is unGodly.</p>
<p>But what is the reason for this? Is it some rule that can&#8217;t be explained? Or can we make some sense of this?</p>
<p>I think it does have some basis in reality. We are easily distracted. Please note, I am not saying we are perverts or we have a hard time controlling ourselves. I am saying that our minds are biased towards simplicity and gravitate toward the external things that are easily seen. Marketers know this and they distract us with beautiful people in their ads for horse manure. But wisdom and maturity are seeing things that are beneath the surface. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>Of course it is entirely possible for a beautiful naked person to be espousing wisdom. It’s just harder to hear the wisdom. This had nothing to do with Judaism or God. Professors at universities, CEOs, and politicians in our Western society dress at least somewhat formally. We all understand this.</p>
<p>Taken to another level, we all disregard showboaters and over-aggressive, transparent, self-promotors. We dismiss those kinds of people and their ideas are taken far less seriously. Our minds know that greatness is usually not “in your face.” We know that greatness is hidden. I think this is the rational explanation for God&#8217;s behavior in hiding God&#8217;s miracles.</p>
<p>Modesty in Judaism is supposed to reflect this value. It applies equally to men and women and applies equally to clothing as it does to the rest of one&#8217;s life. This is the Jewish concept of modesty. It is the first aspect. It explains the value in limiting one&#8217;s external exposure.</p>
<p>If it ended here, we would all take this lesson to heart and try to make our own decisions in consonance with this ideal. Practices would vary but we would all try to live with this concept in our lives.</p>
<p>But orthodox Judaism is not just about ideas and concepts. The rabbis of the Talmud and their halachic heirs take these concepts and interpret them into laws. These are really old laws. Some are 2000 years old. Other more “recent” laws are only several hundred years old.</p>
<p>Over the millennia, the laws of each time and place were added to our legal codes. The rigid laws of our current <i>tznius</i> standards of clothing, whether from the stringent or lenient extremes are borne out of this system. They don&#8217;t really make sense today. They are not really expected to make sense today. These laws are mostly anachronistic.</p>
<p>Today’s laws seem to draw arbitrary lines about what can be seen and what may not be seen. There is little rhyme or reason and this is a breeding ground for stringencies and false displays of piety. With no firm halachic foundation, it is easy to invent new and improved ideas about <i>tznius </i>that can creep into society and become de facto standards seemingly overnight. Some people draw the line here and others draw the line over there. If you’re in doubt? Cover it up. Better to be safe than sorry. The spirit of <i>tznius </i>can be hard to find under these circumstances.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line it seems, we have collectively lost the ability to adapt our laws for modernity within the confines of halacha. That being said, orthodox Jews conform to halachic standards. Sometimes it&#8217;s not easy, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t really make perfect sense, but it&#8217;s the laws that we have and until they are abrogated they are the laws we must keep. This is the second aspect.</p>
<p>There is no real theological reason that <i>tznius</i> should be so heavily regulated and codified in Jewish law while all the other areas of our lives that require us to act with modesty are left to our whims and desires. Rather it is social. Dress codes and sensuality are things that people have traditionally been concerned with and thus we have a huge compilation of laws associated with <i>tznius</i>. This despite the fact that <i>tznius</i> in the Talmud is barely a blip on a very large radar. when it is mentioned it is mentioned as a restriction against reciting the Shema or matrimonial disputes. It is hardly recognizable as a formulaic dress code.</p>
<p>It can feel like there is a huge disconnect between the first aspect and the second aspect. To me it feels that way sometimes. But sometimes there is a price to pay if one wants to be part of orthodox Judaism. This is the way orthodox Judaism is now. It’s not perfect, but it’s the way the first aspect is attempted to be lived contemporarily.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think it always will have to be this way. Mormons also have very strict modesty laws. Their laws also relate to all areas of one&#8217;s life but there is a dress code as well. Their dress code is updated from time to time. It&#8217;s a modern version of modesty. There are some hard and fast rules, but it is not 17th century modesty. It is modern modesty. One who follows their guidelines would certainly be emulating God&#8217;s modesty of hiding greatness behind a veil.</p>
<p>However, if an orthodox Jew would dress in the Mormon way they would probably be shunned by their orthodox Jewish friends and neighbors. It&#8217;s almost certain that they would be chastised by rabbis and modesty activists. But I would venture to guess that they would be modest and they would be satisfying the Godly standard of the Chinuch.</p>
<p>There are two Judaisms. There is the Judaism between Jew and God and there is the Judaism between Jew and fellow Jew. They are not always the same thing.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is a good example of this. One can be dressed very respectfully, modestly, and Godly but still not follow the laws of <i>tznius</i> as they are practiced in orthodox Judaism today. Conversely, one can follow the letter of the law of <i>tznius</i> and be the complete opposite of Godly. We all know this is true.</p>
<p>Maybe, if there is enough demand and enough people who won&#8217;t look down their noses at people with subjective standards of modesty, the first and second aspects of <i>tznius</i> could be reunited. I don&#8217;t expect it to happen quickly, I don&#8217;t even expect it to happen at all. But it is something to think about.</p>
<p>Perhaps there will be some sort of reformation within orthodox Judaism and the standards of <i>tznius</i> will be updated to modern sensibilities. I think guidelines that are similar to the Mormon regulations would be far less criticized than the standards we have today. This, coupled with a severe toning down of <i>tznius</i> rhetoric, blame, and false promises of salvation would completely change the tenor of the <i>tznius</i> conversation. We should be talking about God&#8217;s <i>tznius</i>. The kind of greatness the Chinuch describes is what our goal should be.</p>
<p>At the very least, I think attempting to emulate God in this manner is valuable. It can improve our lives. We can begin to appreciate the wisdom of universal modesty that applies to men and women in all of our lives. Understanding the circumstances that led to <i>tznius</i> regulations in orthodox Judaism today can also soften the challenge of arcane dress codes at least a little bit. But I think the hopeful part of this article is the most important part. Our collective standards might be able to change if we allow them to change. In our hearts we must know that in theory our goal is to be Godly in a way that is not intended nor should it ever be interpreted as a way to control women, burden women with the brunt of dealing with man&#8217;s animalism, some new-agey feminist form of liberation, or the fundamental way women serve God.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is meant to be a way of emulating God. Let’s bring that back and try to end the current trend of fetishizing <i>tznius.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MATZOH-articleLarge.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7292" alt="MATZOH-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/MATZOH-articleLarge-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>The NY Times must be learning Daf Yomi. Just when we all started learning about the laws of chametz and matzah, the Times runs a front page above the fold story on Satmar A (as opposed to Satmar Z) protocols for matzah baking. It seems that Satmar A, and maybe others I really don&#8217;t know, are not satisfied with the &#8220;<em>shmura m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; and add an extra layer of stringency. They are careful to use wheat that did not even become wet while it was growing. They grow wheat on a far flung farm in Arizona where there is no rain for months while the wheat grows.</p>
<p>Why do they do this?</p>
<p>Halacha requires that we use &#8220;Shmurah Matzah&#8221; at the Seder (and some authorities say all Pesach). Shmura Matzah is not synonymous with round, dark matzah. Matzah can be Shmurah and any shape. Shmurah means that the ingredients for the Matzah were watched to ensure that the grains did not become leaven by coming in contact with water and not being baked within 18 minutes. There are three opinions in halacha as to when the ingredients for matzah must be &#8220;watched&#8221; in order to qualify for &#8220;Shmurah Matzah.&#8221; The most &#8220;watched&#8221; that halacha requires in that the wheat be watched from the time of harvesting. That is why most Matzah says &#8220;<em>Shmurah m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; &#8211; watched from the time of reaping.</p>
<p>There are no opinions in halacha that require that the grains not come in contact with water before they are reaped. None that I could find at least.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on here?<span id="more-7290"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times tells us exactly what is going on here. Here is what Professor Samuel Heilman has to say:</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;the competition between the two Satmar groups — each led by one of two brothers — was about one-upmanship.</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“One is always looking to be more authoritative than the other,” Professor Heilman said, “and one of the ways they’re making this happen is over matzo — our matzo is more kosher than yours, we’re more scrupulous and careful over matzo baking than you are.”</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">One-upmanship in halacha. Nailed it. When so many of us are mitzvah observant we need to do things to signal to others that we are different. We are better. That signal is the extra level of stringency that is completely unnecessary. For more on this social phenomenon check this out: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/19/suggestion-read-judaism-as-a-first-language-right-now/">Judaism as a First Language</a></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">But I think there is something more happening here. While it is true that there may be nothing wrong with being extra stringent, this kind of stringency borders on silliness. The concern that created the requirement to use Shmurah Matzah is that the wheat will actually become chametz. If water comes in contact with flour while it is in storage the wheat can become chametz. That&#8217;s science. But it is literally impossible for grains that are still growing to become Chametz. Impossible. In much the same way that it is impossible for cooked matzah to become chametz if it comes in contact with liquid. Yet, there are thousands of Jews who don&#8217;t eat <em>gebrukst </em>because of that very concern.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Adding stringencies like <em>gebrukst</em> and growing wheat where there is no rain only makes sense in one context. If Judaism is a magical, mystical, mystery and our rational minds are useless to understand the laws of Judaism then it does not matter that there is no possibility of becoming chametz. All that matters is that water and wheat do not come in contact ever. Even if the prohibition is against chametz and not all wheat and water become chametz it does not matter. But if Judaism is a religion with Divine instructions that are supposed to be understood as rationally as possible and the rules tell us what our concerns are supposed to be, there is not place for non-sensical stringencies.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">When it comes to chametz, we are given specific instructions as to what the prohibition entails. The law requires us to be careful not to let the wheat and water ferment and begin to rise. It&#8217;s based on science. Anything that could help prevent that from happening is a reasonable stringency. But once we get into the kind of stringencies that will not prevent a violation of a prohibition, it is hard to see their value unless we say something magical is happening and that wheat and water may never touch. The thing is, that&#8217;s not what the Torah, Talmud, Shulchan Aruch, and responsa tell us. To them, it has nothing to do with science. It has everything to do mysticism.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Now I think I can understand why the NY Times found this so interesting. Growing wheat in Arizona so it doesn&#8217;t rain on the wheat? It&#8217;s irrational. It is religion without reason. It&#8217;s exotic, archaic, and mystical. It&#8217;s not the Judaism that so many of us practice. It&#8217;s a Judaism that almost purposely does not make rational sense and is purely mystical. That&#8217;s front page news.</p>
