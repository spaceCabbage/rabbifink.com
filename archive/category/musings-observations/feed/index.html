				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Orthodox Judaism emphasizes Talmud study. Some people love the analysis and debate format of the Talmud but other people prefer studying the final decisions of the Talmud. They don’t enjoy the argument and discussion in the Talmud, and they most certainly do not love the layer upon layer of subsequent debate about the arguments in the Talmud. They simply want the sausage without seeing how it is made.</p>
<p>I happen to enjoy the Talmud’s version of the Socratic method. I especially love the intensity of later commentaries arguing vociferously over small details with broad ramifications.</p>
<p>From a historical perspective, Talmudic argument until the modern era was very different than modern argument. It is not uncommon to read an argument between people from different times and different places who did not know each other and may have never even heard of each other. They argued in slow motion. Their weapons were ink, quill, paper, and snail-mail. This is especially true of the Medieval commentators.<span id="more-9388"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9389 size-large" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1096px-Carl_Schleicher_Eine_Streitfrage_aus_dem_Talmud.jpg?resize=980%2C805" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />Modernity has gifted us with lightning quick communication. We can argue faster and more often than ever before. Given the opportunity, our People will never pass up an opportunity to argue. The Internet has also democratized communication a bit. People who had no voice in the old world, can have a voice in the new world. The thing about democratized communication is that without the social filters that prevented average people from being heard, it can be challenging for us to distinguish between distinguished voices and voices that perhaps should be extinguished. Internet debate also encourages rhetoric and exaggeration, because levelheaded reasoned debate doesn’t play well online.</p>
<p>This is all relevant every day, but this week it’s more relevant than usual. A new Beit Din was established to handle difficult Agunah cases. The Beit Din relies on minority or discarded halachic opinions to unchain women who are still technically married to recalcitrant husbands. This is a certainly a worthy cause and I fully support any attempt to try and build support for the Beit Din.</p>
<p>The problem is that any attempt to resolve the Agunah issue must be consensus based. If even one prominent rabbi disagrees with the tactics of the Beit Din, then the entire enterprise is useless because no one will want to marry the unchained woman for fear that a child will be considered a mamzer or their marriage would be considered “in sin.”</p>
<p>This week, Rabbi Hershel Schachter, the most prominent and learned rabbi in the Modern Orthodox world and four major co-signers, wrote a letter to his colleagues and students urging them not to rely on this new Beit Din. The letter did not make a legal argument. Instead the letter appealed to the lack of rabbinic experience and expertise on these matters, coupled with the gravity of potential sin in these cases.</p>
<p>Much of the vocal response to this letter has been embarrassing.</p>
<p>People are calling Rabbi Schachter a bully, power-hungry, and arrogant. His letter has been called an “unsubstantiated attack” and “scare tactics” as well.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing; none of that is true.</p>
<p>Clearly, reasonable rabbis can disagree on the effectiveness of the new Beit Din’s tactics. Rabbi Schachter has every right to advise the people who rely on him for religious instruction and guidance, he may even have an obligation to do so. His letter was to his constituents.</p>
<p>It is completely inappropriate for anyone to attack Rabbi Schachter’s character or motivation for his opinions. It is especially inappropriate for people with no knowledge of the issues, arguments, and precedent to attack Rabbi Schachter’s character or motivation for his opinions. The most one could say about Rabbi Schachter right now is that he is a conservative halachic jurist.</p>
<p>To one who knows Rabbi Schachter’s character and heart, the rhetoric is even more ridiculous. This is a man who cries nearly every time he speaks in public about issues like Agunah. This is a man who is reduced to tears every time he spends hours on the phone working on an agunah case. This is a man who pulls himself out of the study hall to protest recalcitrant husbands. This is a man who is considered by some Haredi Beit Dins to be too permissive with regard to Agunah and has been “excommunicated” and slandered as a result.</p>
<p>The personal attacks need to stop. The personal attacks that plainly contradict reality are simply embarrassing.</p>
<p>I don’t know enough to argue the issues of the new Beit Din on the merits of precedent and policy. But I know enough to know I don’t know enough. I also know enough to know that the only valid criticism in this discussion is analysis of legal principles. (It feels awfully similar to the lack of honest debate about the Kosher Switch. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/04/24/both-sides-on-the-kosher-switch-debate-and-some-commentary/" target="_blank">Both Sides on the Kosher Switch Debate</a>)</p>
<p>When it comes to philosophy, religious meaning, interpretation of stories, and social issues I think experience and expertise are important but not determinative. But when it comes to Jewish law, our community would be best advised to argue, debate, and discuss the issues among people at any level, but in the end, to defer to the experts. If you’re not going to defer to the experts, at least respect the experts. Remember that there is a proper way to argue. There is a historically consistent way to argue vociferously. Internet shouting matches, click-baity headlines, and hyperventilating are not the way we are supposed to debate important issues. Rabbi Schachter deserves better. We all deserve better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article first appeared in the Jewish Journal</em>.</p>
<p>The Jewish family is in a constant state of mourning. Most of the time, we push our mourning to the back of our collective consciousness and carry on our daily lives as if we’ve suffered no loss. Once a year, though, we allow the misery and pain of our tortuous 2,000-year Diaspora to creep into view and dominate our emotions.That would be Tisha b’Av, our day of mourning. We cry for all that we have lost, for all that could have been, and for a compromised national identity that was detached from our homeland for so long and without its glorious monument to our God. Once a year, we sit on the floor in agony and feel the dormant pain in our souls.</p>
<p>Mourning is a metaphor that helps us cope with Tisha b’Av, which this year begins on the evening of July 25. Metaphors can help us relate to challenging concepts and they can also shine new light to our traditions and rituals.<span id="more-9379"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_9400.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_9400.jpg?resize=600%2C399" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Jewish mourning is unique, and the concept of sitting shivah has even been popularized in media and popular culture. If we are mourning on Tisha b’Av, we are sitting shivah on Tisha b’Av.<!--more--></p>
<p>I see the entire Jewish family sitting on the floor together, sitting shivah together, crying together and mourning together. On Tisha b’Av, our synagogues and prayer gatherings become our shivah homes.</p>
<p>But something is incomplete. One player is missing from the metaphor.</p>
<p>Who will do the mitzvah of nichum aveilim — comforting the bereaved? If we are all mourners, we cannot comfort each other. A shivah with no visitors to comfort the mourners compounds the pain of loss. Have we been so abandoned that no one will come to pay a shivah call to us? Who will comfort us this Tisha b’Av?</p>
<p>It has to be God. Our comfort will come from God.</p>
<p>God is our Menachem (“comforter”). God “visits” us on Tisha b’Av. That’s why we go to synagogue to mourn. Generally, it’s easier to feel God’s presence in synagogue, so we mourn in God’s House. But the Jewish laws of comforting mourners require that the visitor wait for the mourner to speak first. When the mourner is ready to talk, the visitor listens and responds as appropriate. Listening is the most powerful tool in our comfort toolbox.</p>
<p>The character Sadness from the new Pixar movie “Inside Out” taught the world this important lesson when she just listened to Bing Bong and gave him a shoulder to lean on. Somehow, that helped him feel a lot better. A mourner just needs someone to listen.</p>
<p>God is our Visitor. God is sitting in the shivah house. God is just waiting to comfort us. But we need to speak first. We have to give God the opportunity to listen. God is ready to listen; we just need to speak.</p>
<p>Eikhah (Lamentations) and kinnot (expressive religious poems) are our chance to speak. We cry, we lament, we wail, we contemplate, and through the experience, we acknowledge our pain. God listens while we speak. But first we talk. We talk to God about our pain; the new pain and the old. Eikhah and kinnot give us a chance to speak first and it is our way of granting God permission to comfort us.</p>
<p>This Tisha b’Av, let us be conscious of our mourning. Let us imagine ourselves experiencing shivah together in God’s House. Let us remember that we have not been abandoned. God is coming to comfort us. Let us allow God to comfort us by speaking to him first and acknowledging our suffering with our words. Let us experience God’s “shivah call” and may we merit to feel God’s comfort. Let us hope and pray that this year we will get up from shivah after Tisha b’Av and never feel the spiritual agony of Tisha b’Av ever again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pew Research Center released their recent study, and the results paint a bleak picture of our religious future in America. It is clear: God’s poll numbers are down across the board, and especially among Millennials. Immediately, frantic media headlines prophesied the end of religion as we know it.</p>
<p>Is this fate? Are we destined to live in a non-religious world? I don’t think we are doomed, unless we keep doing the same things we are doing now. If we want to reverse the trend, we need to reverse course. Suggesting change in religious circles is often taboo. It reminds me of one of my father’s oft repeated (aren’t they all?) jokes. <em>How many Ultra-Orthodox rabbis does it take to change a lightbulb?</em> [beat] <em>Change?!</em><br />
<span id="more-9356"></span></p>
<p>We believers think God gave us our religions. They are not ours to be tinkered and toyed with on a whim.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/07/13/religion-is-dead-long-live-religion/sf/" rel="attachment wp-att-9357"><img class="alignright wp-image-9357 size-thumbnail" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sf.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="sf" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Thus, many believers exclaim that people are abandoning religion because we have become too flexible, too apologetic, too concerned with popular opinion and trends. Their solution is fundamentalism, as it was for the Puritans after the Renaissance, premillennial dispensationalists after Darwin, and Evangelicals in the 80’s after the sexual revolution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, post-modern fundamentalists are making a fundamental mistake. Most Millennials will never be fundamentalists. Above all, they reject the idea that there is only one universal truth. Where hippies rejected authority on principle, Millennials reject appeals to authority because there is no such thing as an authority of ideas. For my entire lifetime of active learning, I’ve been able to fact check anything asserted by an authority as fact. I have never needed to trust authority or rely on the opinions of one person. Self-guided research, diversity, and subjectivity are native to the Millennial generation.</p>
<p>When presented with fundamentalist ideas, we don’t find the “all or nothing” packages attractive. Some of the ideas that are preached by fundamentalists have merit, but that does not translate into adopting fundamentalism. It did in the 80’s. Evangelical Christianity and the Jewish “returnee” movement were massive movements that took hold in the 80’s, and both remain in their own shadows from that time. More fundamentalism is not the answer. In fact, it&#8217;s part of the problem.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the non-fundamentalist option has been to change. When the rules get tough, change the rules. If some of the theology is at odds with modern ideals, just rewrite it. By drawing a target around the arrow after it is lodged in the tree, liberal religious groups can make participation effortless and guiltless. The appeal of change is that is promises everything, but the reality is that this sort of change completely undermines religion.</p>
<p>Millennials flock to authentic experiences. Burning Man is a perfect example of this.  A Burning Man experience is powerful, unique, and above all, authentic.  Similarly, artisanal foods are quintessentially Millennial. No Millennial is trading fine French cuisine for a Big Mac. We want the real thing. We want meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>A counterfeit religious experience is no religious experience at all. It might keep families together at church and synagogue for a few more years, but without authenticity and engagement, nothing will connect Millennials to the experience. It’s hollow. When the structural shell is removed, nothing remains.</p>
<p>But all is not lost. I think there is an alternative approach that respects tradition, does not compromise authenticity, and works for Millennials. The first part of my proposal is that religion is actually a collection of beliefs and practices which ask us to struggle in the tension they create. There is beauty in tension. Ambiguity and doubt are key ingredients to great art. Poetry, music, theater, visual arts, culinary arts, love, and beauty are all ambiguous. They are all open to interpretation, and they all ask us to insert our struggles into the space they create for creative understanding.</p>
<p>We must stop preaching certainty and begin preaching doubt and struggle. Find beauty in the tension, instead of satisfaction in certainty. Religious leaders must be honest, and publicly acknowledge their own struggles and doubts. Instead of occupying the space of certainty that is anathema to Millennials, religion must occupy the space of subjectivity, ambiguity, and struggle. Religion is not the answer to life’s questions. Religion is the tool for exploring the big questions.</p>
<p>We can tolerate mistakes, difficult challenges, unanswered questions, and tension between tradition and modernity. We will not tolerate platitudes, over-confidence, false bravado, and apologetics. Be honest. Acknowledge the problems. Admit your own struggles. Then, invite the Millennials in your life to join you for an authentic experience of engaging with life’s struggles through the lens of religion. The Biblical heroes were flawed and they struggled. Let’s emphasize those stories and animate those Bible passages in our teachings.</p>
<p>The second part of my proposal is found in the tension between nostalgia and relevance. So much of our religious instruction and experience is nostalgic. We try to recapture something magical from our childhood, or a latent memory from a place and time that tugs at us. Millennials love nostalgia, and it’s a valuable tool when, but religion cannot subsist on nostalgia alone.</p>
<p>Our world is so different from the world of our Biblical heroes. Our lives are virtually nothing like the lives of the centuries of interpreters and teachers of religion. We must continue to lean on the eternal teaching they have bequeathed to us, but their teachings felt contemporary to their direct audiences. When we retell their teachings, they may feel nostalgic at best and irrelevant at worst. We must continue to write and create teachings that resonate with us and tell our story.</p>
<p>The Bible is an incredible canvas. Religious texts offer innumerable opportunities for modern interpretation. Not the kind that strips religion of its precepts, rather, the sort of modern interpretations that bring ancient teachings to life. When we explain our rituals, we must choose explanations that add meaning to our lives today. Take ownership of our religions. We can&#8217;t expect Millennials to be spectators of their religion. Millennials want to participate with mind, spirit, soul, and body. Relevance is key to hooking religion to our lives, and not merely relegating our traditions to museums and mausoleums.</p>
<p>I believe in God. I believe in religion. I believe in Millennials. This is fixable problem. Let’s fix it. Acknowledge our struggles. Live in the tension. Make religion relevant with new and modern interpretation. Live a life infused with religious meaning. When the results of the next Pew report on religion in America are released, we can shock the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that it is unconstitutional for a state to ban same sex marriage. The issue still divides America, though the latest Pew numbers say 54% of Americans are in favor of gay marriage and only 36% oppose.</p>
<p>In the Orthodox Jewish community, the matter is far less polarizing. I could not find any actual numbers, but I think most people are correct in assuming that the vast majority of Orthodox Jews oppose same sex marriage for themselves and for America. All the mainstream Orthodox Jewish umbrella organizations have issued statements over the past few years reiterating this opposition. Some Orthodox Jews are ambivalent on the issue, and a small minority are in favor of gay marriage.</p>
<p>I celebrate the Supreme Court decision.<span id="more-9339"></span></p>
<p>A lot of people are confused how an Orthodox rabbi who follows the Torah and its laws could celebrate the legalization of gay marriage.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/28/i-believe-in-torah-halacha-and-equality/america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1-si/" rel="attachment wp-att-9340"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9340" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1.si_.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="america-reaction-scotus-gay-marriage1.si" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I have been mocked, berated, insulted, defrocked, and even ousted from Orthodoxy for supporting marriage equality. I’ve been asked, respectfully and less respectfully, how I reconcile my  belief in marriage equality and my religious beliefs. This is my official response.</p>
<p>Marriage equality is a civil rights issue. Gay people exist. They are your neighbors and co-workers. They might be your friends and family as well. It’s hard to be gay in America. There’s trauma involved. Gay people fall in love. They want to live together as a married couple. They want to get married for the same reasons everyone else wants to get married. Restricting consenting adults from a loving, committed marriage is a form of discrimination. I believe that discrimination is wrong. I believe that citizens of free countries should not feel oppressed. I believe that more freedom for more people is a good thing for everyone, including Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>Of course, I am concerned about the implications of the ruling. I am concerned about clergy with religious objections to officiating a gay marriage, but those personal concerns cannot trump the more basic civil rights of others, especially people who typically suffer persecution and discrimination.</p>
<p>I am not concerned about slippery slopes or men marrying dogs and bikes and children. Marriage requires consent. Dogs, bikes, and children cannot consent.</p>
<p>I am not concerned that America is becoming a Godless state with no morals. If you want equal rights and protection under the law, everyone else must benefit, too. It is wrong to suggest that equality applies unevenly. Orwell said it best in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451526341/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0451526341&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=VHSNVVTJV2A2QCBZ">Animal Farm</a>, <em>&#8220;All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others.&#8221;</em> It is moral to be fair to others, even if those others are people who violate your religious beliefs. There are competing morals in this case, and America is choosing the more compassionate and the more just of the moral options.</p>
<p>Marriage equality is a good thing. I celebrate marriage equality. I am also an Orthodox Jew and I would not perform a religious wedding ceremony that is not consistent with my understanding of Jewish law, including a gay marriage. Those two statements are not contradictory.</p>
<p>There is a long list of things that I think are very important to Orthodox Judaism. Banning gay marriage is near the bottom of the list. Kindness, compassion, and fairness are near the top of the list.</p>
<p>I understand that many Orthodox Jews have visceral fears about this gay marriage because of Jewish law. I hope we can get past those fears and move forward toward understanding and love.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s talk about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/17/inside-out-movie-review-and-analysis/">Inside Out</a> again. But this time we are not just going to talk in the superficial, “go see it” kind of way we did last time. Now it’s time for real talk.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Storytelling and Canvas Building</strong></span><br />
Movies can be diversions or just pure entertainment, but sometimes movies can be so much more. There are movies that illustrate grand important ideas in a new way that pushes culture and society forward. To me, this is the peak of storytelling. When the story itself is not really the thing the story is saying, because the thing the story is saying is so much bigger than the story, we experience a sort of storytelling magic.</p>
<p>Too often, fiction undermines reality. I’ll never forget this quip from Rabbi Tendler during a private study session. <em>“If you expect marriage to be the way marriage is portrayed in novels and films, you’re going to be waiting a long time for the violins.”</em> In context, he was teaching me that relationships take work and popular culture is not very good at real relationships. Generally, we watch saccharine caricatures of real life with simple resolutions, over-emphasis on raw feelings, and of course, violins.</p>
<p>I love when fiction does not try to rewrite reality. I love when fiction tells us something about reality. Done right, a movie can be a powerful storytelling device that helps us to understand and deal with reality. Fiction can be real.<span id="more-9321"></span></p>
<p><strong><u>A Movie of Biblical Proportions</u></strong><br />
Inside Out is not a very interesting story. There’s no villain, except maybe “the passing of time” and most of the story happens inside the head of an 11 year old girl named Riley. A lot of people seem to think that the movie is about the voices inside Riley. But the movie is not about the voices inside Riley’s head at all. They are just part of the canvas the real story of Inside Out is painting.</p>
<p>The brilliance of Inside Out is its lesson. Its mini lessons along the way are amazing. The way it teaches its lessons, using its internal metaphors and symbolism, is much more than brilliance, it is almost Biblical.</p>
<p>I think the primary lesson of Inside Out is profoundly simple. We have all been misled to believe that happiness is the cumulative feeling of avoiding pain, sadness, misery, and doubt. That is a lie. Happiness and joy are not the absence of bad experiences at all. In fact, without negative experiences, there is no joy. Children are not mature enough to understand this sophisticated point even if it is taught directly. Children deal with emotions and feelings in a very binary way. Things are either good or bad.</p>
<p>The real world is not like this at all.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/24/growing-up-what-religion-can-learn-from-the-magic-of-inside-out/insideout-640/" rel="attachment wp-att-9325"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9325" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/insideout-640.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="insideout-640" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Everything in our lives is a complex cocktail of contributory emotions. A little bit happy, a little bit sad, a little bit angry, a little bit worried, a little bit thrilled, and all at different levels. The first time we feel these complexities, it can be disconcerting. Adolescents are often brooding, moody, unpredictable, and sometimes their personalities are very different than they were as children. Part of that is the discomfort with encountering reality and perhaps even the real self. Inside Out is a parable that helps us understand the challenge of growing up from a child to an adult.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The New &#8216;A Separate Peace&#8217;</strong></span><br />
The fear and loathing of meeting one’s real self is the theme of one of my favorite books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743253973/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0743253973&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=ZWOK3ZIBBJ3RR5JF">A Separate Peace</a>. It’s a mediocre story, but the story is not really the thing the story is saying. A Separate Peace is about adolescence, and facing one’s true self. That’s what it’s really about.</p>
<p>Inside Out is working on a different angle. The movie is helping us be honest with ourselves about what really makes us happy. Inside Out shows us that the best feelings and best emotions are a mixture of joy, anger, disgust, fear, and even sadness. In fact, Joy was only able to return to Riley because of Sadness. Acknowledging our sadness gives us the opportunity for happiness, not avoiding sadness. It wasn’t only Sadness, it was also letting go of childhood by saying goodbye to her imaginary childhood friend, Bing Bong. It’s counterintuitive at first, but just past the initial superficial level, lies this obvious truth. There is no happiness without sadness and there is no growing up without letting go of childhood.</p>
<p>These ideas are almost glibly demonstrated during Inside Out. But don’t let the simplicity of the way Inside Out teaches its lessons fool you into thinking these are not sophisticated and meaningful teachings.</p>
<p>Once Riley’s feelings are able to work together to craft more meaningful memories, their control panel console grows. Children only experience one feeling at a time and only one feeling can be in charge at any given moment. When we grow up, each feeling has a seat at the table and they all work together instead of jockeying for control. This is the primary lesson of Inside Out.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some Bonus Lessons</span></strong><br />
Along the way, Inside Out creates a magnificent storytelling device that gives the writers opportunities to teach so many more lessons that are tangential to the story. Inside Out sees our memories as sources of power for several islands in Riley’s brain. Each island represents a fundamental group of memories and experiences that Riley “visits” during nostalgic moments. The internal logic of the movie kicks Joy and Sadness out of Riley consciousness following a traumatic experience. Joy and Sadness find themselves marooned far away from headquarters. Their path back to headquarters is along the connection between headquarters and the islands. As Riley destroys her islands by poisoning her memories with rebellion, the path through Family Island remains Joy’s last hope. But when Riley kills Honesty Island, the paths to headquarters are all gone. I thought this was an incredible, subtle message about the importance of honesty. As long we are honest with others and ourself there is a path back.</p>
<p>Another amazing lesson was perhaps the most explicit moral of all. Bing Bong is feeling very sad and Joy tries every trick in the book to cheer him up. She is doing everything she can do to overpower Bing Bong’s sad feelings with her intense joy. It does not work. Sadness sits down next to Bing Bong and just listens to him tell her how he feels. Sadness tells him that she totally understands why he is sad and offers a hug and shoulder to cry on. That works. Joy is flabbergasted. Sadness explains that she saw he was sad so she just wanted him to know that she understands.</p>
<p>Later in the movie, Riley and her parents share a tender moment when they are honest with each other about how they feel. No one tries to fix their sadness or anxiety. They simply hear each other and enjoy a loving family hug.</p>
<p>Too often, we think the way to help a sad friend is to cheer them up. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/05/fixing-shiva/" target="_blank">But I think it’s always more helpful to just listen, understand, and offer a warm hug and shoulder to cry on</a>.</p>
<p>There are many additional teachings sprinkled though Inside Out. A few memorable moments stand out. My favorite might be when a box labeled “Opinions” and box labeled “Facts” spill over and the contents get mixed up. &#8220;Oh no!&#8221; exclaims Joy, &#8220;these facts and opinions look so similar!&#8221; &#8220;People are always getting these mixed up,&#8221; says Bing Bong. Indeed, they do.</p>
<p><strong><u>Who Cares?!</u></strong><br />
Why am I talking about Inside Out? Is there a point to all this?</p>
<p>Good question. Yes, there is a point to all this Inside Out talk. Two major points, in fact. One from the negative perspective and one from a positive perspective.</p>
<p>We are all Riley. Those of us are religious Rileys have an additional island of memories in our brain. Religious Riley has Religion Island. That’s where all our religious memories live. For most children, Religion Island should be pretty sweet. Kids love religion. It’s fun. The stories are interesting. The food is familiar. You spend more time with parents and family. Religion Island is awesome when you’re a kid. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">I think it&#8217;s important to actively create this sweetness for our families and communities</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Religious Trauma</span></strong><br />
Inside Out showed us how trauma shatters our childhood islands. When pain and sadness infect our religious nostalgia, we are destroying Religious Island. Some trauma is a direct result of religious experience and other trauma is unrelated to the religious experience. Any trauma can wreck Religion Island. This can happen even against our own wishes.</p>
<p>Religious leaders who seek to hide or inhibit public conversation about religious leaders who stumble or other flaws in their community, for fear of encouraging religious reprisal., or worse, are missing the point. It’s not the knowledge of bad behavior that harms people, it’s the trauma itself. Trauma severs the relationship between the person and the positive memories. Hearing about it does not do that at all. I think the Religious Island Destroyed by Trauma metaphor severely undermines the strategy of silencing criticism or victims of abuse.</p>
<p>More importantly, it explains why most of the people who leave their religious communities, don&#8217;t find comfort in a less strict religious community. Their religious island is gone. This new place is not the old place. The new place feels fraudulent and fake. <a href="http://zeek.forward.com/articles/117822/" target="_blank">The trust is gone</a>. But that does not mean it&#8217;s the end of the story.</p>
<p>There is also something incredible hopeful about the way Inside Out portrayed how Riley <em>rebuilt</em> her islands. True, the islands were completely useless following the trauma Riley experienced. But the movie shows us those islands restored and thriving even more than they were before they were broken. We also see added complexity to Riley’s islands and they are being powered by the new core memory cocktails of mixed feelings.</p>
<p>Often enough, people want to rebuild their dilapidated or broken religious islands. Somehow, Religion Island was destroyed for them at some point.  Eventually, they might want to reassemble their religious islands. But reconstruction is not possible using those old simple memories that are generally good. The cotton candy version of religion is gone for these people, but <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/11/11/rising-from-the-ashes-of-bad-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">building something new, with complexity, embracing ambiguity, and engaging in their struggles, is absolutely available</a>. It takes work, but it might be worth the effort.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consciousness and Construction</span></strong><br />
I think most conscious people have had their dreamlike childhood memories smashed. They might have felt real in the moment, but they are not reality. The real world is complex and confusing and contradictory. Real lasting relationships are built out of mixed core memory cocktails. Relationships between us and our spirituality, between us and our religion, between us and our community, our family, our spouse, our parents, our children, and ourselves, all can function, blissfully unaware, in rainbow, lollipop, and unicorn mode. In that mode, they are super fragile and they might collapse in a quick heap. But all our relationships function on a much higher level if we are conscious of the relationship and its complexity. They improve, when the parties to a relationship make the effort to build after something has been broken.</p>
<p>This secret to living is the soul of one important message in Inside Out. It&#8217;s applicable to religion, but it&#8217;s just as applicable to friendship, courtship, marriage, self awareness, and any other relationship. We start with only childish nostalgia. It might break one day and that will hurt, a lot. But moving past our childish nostalgia is not bad or evil, it&#8217;s just growing up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about time too. After all those years of hinting to us that we should try to just be a kid and stay young forever, Disney Pixar is telling us that it&#8217;s also time to grow up &#8211; from the inside, out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disney Pixar movies are cultural events in our world. No studio is as careful with their product and as successful with their product as Pixar. Yet, my anticipation level for their latest film, Inside Out, far exceeded previous expectations. I was a little concerned that I was setting myself up for disappointment. A few hours ago, I saw an early screening of Inside Out and it was the greatest movie I have ever seen. The after-movie <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10102813803182695">feeling was like Interstellar</a>, only more intense.</p>
<p>Everyone is familiar with the premise of the film. We interact with the main character on two levels. Riley is our 11 year old hero on the surface level, but the movie also tells its story from the perspective of her feelings. We meet her Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust as they work together to give Riley the best emotional experience. That&#8217;s the part everyone knows, but that&#8217;s not really what the movie is about.</p>
<p>The movie is actually a coming of age story. It&#8217;s not so much about Riley&#8217;s emotions, as much as it is about how Riley&#8217;s emotions as a child are completely different from the emotions that come as she reaches her teenage years. This is the note Inside Out plays so magnificently. The story of Riley&#8217;s feelings takes the first 25 minutes of the film. It is spectacular. I was grinning from the first moment and crying from the second. Inside Out is an emotional roller coaster and the first act of the film is a steady barrage of sweetness peppered with punches to the gut. I loved it, but it was intense.<span id="more-9304"></span></p>
<p>Luckily, Inside Out is also hilarious. We are treated to plenty of the customary slapstick humor as well as high brow comedy that strikes just the right balance of subtle humor and insight into the characters.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/17/inside-out-movie-review-and-analysis/40089bd8a3615c0db500adc387c0794a_xl/" rel="attachment wp-att-9306"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9306" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/40089bd8a3615c0db500adc387c0794a_XL.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="40089bd8a3615c0db500adc387c0794a_XL" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Inside Out is at its most magical during Act II. The conflict of the film and its resolution are never really in doubt as you watch the movie. The gift of Inside Out is not it&#8217;s story, but its storytelling. Act II uses the canvas established in Act I and animates a world so intimate and connected to our personhood that it seems like the metaphors are being stretched too thin. In truth, the metaphors of Inside Out are so magnificently constructed that they bend but do not break. I am reluctant to spoil anything for readers who want to see Inside Out without more direct clues and references, so I am warning you now. Extremely minor spoilers ahead. Choose wisely. If you are leaving now, go watch the movie, come back to this page, and continue reading from here.</p>
<p>If the the story of Riley&#8217;s feelings is the canvas, what exactly is the painting? In essence, the premise of Inside Out is that every memory we collect in our life is assigned an emotion. In the movie, these memories are colored crystal spheres. The spheres are filed in various places in Riley&#8217;s brain the way we would imagine our memories being collated. Some are discarded, others sent to Riley&#8217;s Long Term Memory, others remain local, and the most important memories are called Core Memories. These Core Memories build the thematic islands in Riley&#8217;s memory. There is an island for family, and friends, and goofiness, and hockey, among others. Throughout her day, Riley&#8217;s brain shifts between recalling old memories from relevant islands and adding new memories to those islands. Each crystal sphere is defined by a feeling and when it is added to the inventory or remembered, the memory retains its feelings. An angry family memory will be colored red, it will be added to the inventory, and it will help power the family island. That&#8217;s how it all works.</p>
<p>Of course, there is so much room for humor and hijinks when dealing with memories. I won&#8217;t spoil those, but the group of mostly adult theater goers were laughing hysterically when they weren&#8217;t collapsing from the emotional drain of the sentimental moments.</p>
<p>Without spoiling the plot, Act II is all about the crystal spheres and the islands. The story is nice, but as I said in my Interstellar review, the greatness of this film is not its story, it is the magic of its storytelling device. Pixar does not waste its opportunity. Inside Out is a battering ram of important lessons, ideas, and issues. Which leads me to a some final points.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that one reason I related to strongly to Inside Out is because I am the father of a son who recently turned 12 years old. Inside Out was basically about him. He knew it. We knew it. And it was quite powerful to experience this movie with him. Pixar is not just entertaining us with its movies. Pixar is moving the cultural dial. There is stuff in the movie that we have been working on as a family and as individuals. Character stuff. Growing up stuff. In fact, the comparison I keep hearing in my head is to A Separate Peace: a coming of age story that encapsulates the social struggles of the high school teen, and by proxy, adults as well. Inside Out is a coming of age story that encapsulates the emotional struggles of the preteen, and by proxy, teens and adults as well.</p>
<p>But above all, I heard so many themes, lessons, and metaphors in the film that sounded more than just familiar to me, they sounded <em>like me. </em>I have been using a version of the crystal sphere memories metaphor for years. I&#8217;ve applied it to religion &#8211; that is the essence of this essay: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/">Cultivating Positive Jewish Experiences</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/11/11/rising-from-the-ashes-of-bad-orthodox-jewish-experiences/">Rising From the Ashes of Bad Orthodox Jewish Experiences</a> , I&#8217;ve also applied it to relationships in my pastoral work, and I&#8217;ve applied it to life in general. Seeing an idea I&#8217;ve worked through over the course of many years in my own life and in conversations with others come to life on the big screen was a powerful experience for me on a personal level. Inside Out is saying something that I have been trying to say for a little while now. That was pretty special for me.</p>
<p>One last thing. On a societal level, I am proud to be part of a global community that values the fundamental moral of the Inside Out story as I see it. We all want happiness and joy and we can sometimes think that we will feel happiness and joy if we don&#8217;t feel all the other feelings. But one thing our society understands is that happiness and joy can only be real when they are part of a collective of feelings. Inside Out teaches this lesson superbly, and that makes me proud.</p>
<p>Adults, teens, and children 10 and older should definitely see Inside Out. Younger children might not appreciate its finer themes, but there is nothing objectionable for the under 10 crowd. Families should capitalize on this film to engage in frank conversations about feelings and emotions. Use Inside Out to inspire and ignite you to make yourself a better person, friend, spouse, parent, and child.</p>
<p><em>I intend to write a follow up essay that actually discusses some of my favorite lessons and most poignant moments from the film. I also want to demonstrate how I think this all connects to religion and Judaism. But it wouldn&#8217;t make sense without seeing Inside Out. So get on that, and hopefully soon I can write a more spoiler-y analysis of Inside Out&#8217;s brilliance.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This essay was written on October 8, 2013. It was never published. I think it&#8217;s still perfectly relevant.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/" target="_blank">The Pew report</a> confirmed what many Jewish people already knew. Non-Orthodox Judaism is in crisis. According to Professor Stephen M. Cohen over 75% of non-Orthodox Jews are intermarried. About 43% of children of intermarriage consider themselves Jewish. The numbers are devastating and religious leaders are scrambling for solutions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, despite doomsday predictions from the 20th century, the Orthodox Jewish data demonstrates strength and viability. Almost 0% of Orthodox Jews intermarry and over 80% of Orthodox Jews between the age of 19 and 29 stay orthodox.</p>
<p>Some people think this is cause for celebrating Orthodox triumph. Other Orthodox Jews think that Orthodox Jews must step up outreach efforts to bring non-Orthodox Jews into the fold of Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I think there is a third approach.<span id="more-9291"></span></p>
<p>Professor Cohen suggested that <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/editorial-opinion/editorial/losing-our-faith">Orthodox Jews and non-Orthodox increase their social ties</a>. Both groups believe that the other is not interested, but that needs to change.</p>
<p>I agree with Professor Cohen. As it stands right now, Orthodox Jews are enjoined from participating in inter-denominational activities and groups as per a nearly unanimous rabbinic ruling of the generation&#8217;s greatest Torah authorities in the middle of the 20th century. But there is a price to this ruling. The price is very clear boundaries between fellow Jews. Sociologically this has the negative effect of preventing cross-pollination of ideas. Non-orthodox Jews get little access to the vibrancy and beauty of Jewish traditions and practices that are found in Orthodox Judaism.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9293" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/puzzle-pieces-852x500.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="puzzle-pieces-852x500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The context that non-Orthodox Jews have the greatest interaction with Orthodox Jews is <em>&#8220;kiruv.&#8221;</em> But this is not the same as creating social ties that breach the gates of the self imposed ghetto. This is interaction for the purpose of eliciting a specific desired result. I am suggesting interaction for the sake of interaction. Social ties with no strings attached won&#8217;t limit the interactions to potential <em>kiruv</em> candidates and will more likely be institutionally accepted by the non-Orthodox.</p>
<p>A <em>kiruv</em> relationship is one where the Orthodox Jew wants something for the non-Orthodox Jew. But the non-Orthodox Jew may not want the same thing. Even if the non-Orthodox Jew eventually comes to desire the same thing the Orthodox Jew wants, the relationship began as an uneven partnership. The two parties had different goals. The desired outcome is different for each party. The Orthodox  Jew wants the non-Orthodox to adopt an Orthodox lifestyle and the non-Orthodox Jew might simply want a friend. The best relationships are mutually beneficial and are created as balanced partnerships. Both parties have similar goals and aspirations for the relationship. They agree on the hopeful outcome. Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews must create these kinds of social ties. Friendship for the sake of the friendship.</p>
<p>This is aside from the obvious benefit increased intra-denominational activity will have on Jewish unity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2013/10/03/can-liberal-judaism-survive" target="_blank">In an article published by OnFaith</a>, Rabbi David Wolpe suggested that liberal Judaism must embrace rituals in order to survive.<em> &#8220;Wearing Tefillin, praying in Hebrew, Torah study, Kashrut, Jewish communal adherence and activities — these things (while not necessarily limited only to Jews) are activities that keep the core of the tradition alive.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Rituals create a common language and uniquely Jewish experiences. Jews with these collective experiences as part of their religious identity will want to perpetuate these rituals in their family lives. This increases the desirability of marrying Jewish. It&#8217;s not simply tribalism or religious mandate. It&#8217;s a self-interested choice to pass on uniquely Jewish experiences to one&#8217;s children.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s the point of all these rituals? What benefit is there to the non-Orthodox Jew? This is a question that Orthodox Jews are adequately positioned to answer.</p>
<p>Who better than Orthodox Jews to impart the wisdom of these rituals? What better way is there to demonstrate the value in these rituals than the people who do them on a regular basis? It need not be for the purpose of proselytization. It is simply an opportunity to better appreciate the role of rituals in Judaism.</p>
<p>If non-Orthodox Jews are interested in learning about rituals, the Orthodox Jewish community is uniquely poised to step in and create mutually beneficial relationships with non-Orthodox Jews. Now we can honestly say that we are interested in the same outcome. We have an opportunity to create balanced, even friendships. We all want the same thing. This can stimulate increased social ties between all Jews.</p>
<p>Hopefully, non-Orthodox Jews will heed Rabbi Wolpe&#8217;s call and trend toward adding more traditional rituals to their observance. After all, this is a major key to Jewish continuity.</p>
<p>Even among formerly Orthodox Jews who have made the choice to leave Orthodox Judaism, many find that some rituals are worth perpetuating. Most end up marrying fellow Jews. I suspect that this has a lot to do with common experiences and a bit of nostalgia toward their Judaism. That can be replicated within the non-Orthodox Jewish community as well.</p>
<p>The Orthodox Jewish community cannot afford to let this opportunity slip through its fingers either. It is time we adjust our goals and reach across the aisle for the sake of friendship and <strong>mutually agreed upon goals</strong>.</p>
<p>I ask Orthodox and non-Orthodox rabbis and leaders to consider the price of denominational isolation. I ask my Jewish brethren to consider the price of our failure to communicate to one another. We are all in this together. Let&#8217;s act like it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another summer in Israel, another war. This war is playing out in the pages of the Jewish media, and this time we&#8217;re our own worst enemy. Intramural fighting between passionate commentators and rabbis has a place in our culture. In the Talmud it is called the milchamta shel Torah. But sometimes, zealots for our cause can creates a war that should have been settled patiently by cooler heads.</p>
<p>We are being told there is a battle between the Chief Rabbinate and Rabbi Riskin. I am not so convinced, but some things are abundantly clear. <a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/r-riskin-versus-the-chief-rabbinate-a-dose-of-reality/" target="_blank">Supporters of the Chief Rabbinate and their brand of more conservative Orthodox Judaism</a> are concerned about more liberal Orthodoxy. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/.premium-1.658189" target="_blank">Supporters of more liberal Orthodoxy</a> are uncomfortable with the de facto institutionalized rabbinic authority given to the Rabbinate. These are legitimate differences of philosophy that are not particularly new, nor very likely to be solved by the current controversy.</p>
<p>If we scratch beneath the surface, something disturbing emerges. It seems that the entire controversy has been manufactured by supporters of both sides with little concern for fact checking or measured reaction.<span id="more-9280"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.658051" target="_blank">Haaretz reports</a>: <em>“On Monday, the Chief Rabbinate Council, headed by Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau, refused to extend Riskin’s tenure in the post and demanded that he present himself at the council’s next meeting to discuss the issue. […]</em></p>
<p><em>“According to the Chief Rabbinate, the problem is strictly technical: Whereas younger rabbis’ appointments are usually renewed automatically, Riskin is over 75, and all rabbis over 75 are required to submit a written request for reappointment and then appear before the council. Riskin neither submitted a written request nor attended Monday’s council meeting, and therefore, his appointment couldn’t be renewed, it said.”</em></p>
<p>The second paragraph explains the first paragraph. The Chief Rabbinate is following its own protocols and thus they did not “refuse” to extend Rabbi Riskin’s tenure, nor did they “demand” he present himself for a meeting. This is what they are supposed to do under the circumstances.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/01/the-manufactured-controversy-between-the-chief-rabbinate-and-rabbi-riskin/7526-toysoldiers-06/" rel="attachment wp-att-9281"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9281" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7526-toysoldiers-06.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="7526-toysoldiers-06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Still, the request was seen as an admonishment and personal attack on Rabbi Riskin. After all, Rabbi Riskin holds many opinions that are far more liberal than the Rabbinate, so everyone just assumes this is a religiously motivated political attack.</p>
<p>The line in the sand was drawn and shots were fired from both sides of this controversy. Some lined up behind Rabbi Riskin to defend him against “inappropriate” treatment. Others defended the decision of Chief Rabbinate by pointing out how far Rabbi Riskin has veered from the traditional positions of Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>All of this based on virtually nothing! Put your weapons down everyone. There’s nothing to see here, yet.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/NGO-cites-chief-rabbinate-documents-showing-rabbis-rarely-summoned-for-tenure-extensions-404285" target="_blank">Rabbi Seth Farber from ITIM researched the issue</a> that we got any evidence based data. Rabbi Farber&#8217;s research discovered that rabbis are generally rubber stamped even if they are older than 75. Citing public record, Rabbi Farber argues that this is the first time the Rabbinate has made such a request. Thus, the assumption that the Rabbinate was snubbing Rabbi Riskin for ideological reasons was correct.</p>
<p>Fight on!</p>
<p>The Chief Rabbinate responded that all the previous cases were before the tenure of the new chief rabbis, and the new policy is to hold hearings for renewal of older rabbis. Further, the Chief Rabbinate claims that they also gave notice to the chief rabbi of Jerusalem that fitness hearings would be standard operating procedure in the new regime.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe not.</p>
<p>I have a general rule. When presented with a choice about how to explain something that bothers us, and one of the choices is a legitimate justification for the behavior and the other is assigns negative motivations and harmful intent to the behavior, choose the one that sees the act favorably. In other words, we can choose to be hurt by ambiguous behavior or we can choose to rationalize ambiguous behavior. Unless the only reasonable option is that the behavior was done to harm us, we have to choose the benevolent option. That doesn’t excuse ambiguous behavior that hurts us, but it does soften the sting of hateful intentions.</p>
<p>In this story, the Chief Rabbinate’s behavior is plausible and well within reasonable norms. Rabbis in their employ should be of fit mind and health. That’s a good policy. It’s true that creatively connecting the dots, reinterpreting their actions, adding unspoken motivations, and calling them liars will build a story that is insulting and unsettling, but that requires a lot of subjective interpretation and some conspiracy theory. On the other hand, if the hearing is pro-forma and Rabbi Riskin is being treated the same way the Chief Rabbinate will treat everyone else, the story is not disturbing at all. If they want to get rid of Rabbi Riskin, why do it in a profoundly offensive translucent manner? If this is their play to remove Rabbi Riskin, it’s pretty stupid. Since when is the Chief Rabbinate afraid to “own” offensive positions?</p>
<p>Our loud reaction to this story, by supporters on both sides, tells us more about ourselves than about the Chief Rabbinate and Rabbi Riskin. Too many people among the ranks of both sides are little bit too trigger happy. Perhaps it’s some form of religious warfare PTSD and the slightest noise sets us over the edge. It’s as if there are two armies, battle weapons drawn, just waiting for someone to fire, even if it’s inadvertent. We need to settle down. Rest our war machines. Talk to each other. Maybe share a Coke, or something. That always seems to work.</p>
<p>We will all have our answer in a month. The hearing is scheduled for the end of June, so all this hyperventilating seems a bit premature as well. However, even if the Chief Rabbinate discriminates against Rabbi Riskin and rules against him, that only determines whether Rabbi Riskin draws a government salary. That’s all. He can still be the rabbi. He can still be Orthodox. It sends a strong message of intolerance, but we already know the Chief Rabbinate and Rabbi Riskin are on opposite sides of a spectrum where tolerance is tenuous.</p>
<p>Personally, I strongly support Rabbi Riskin’s right to an opinion. I hate the idea that the Chief Rabbinate can effectively play the role of de facto Sanhedrin and establish universal standards of Orthodox Judaism. That is not acceptable to me. I am very hopeful that this will all have been wild speculation by soldiers of the Almighty suffering from PTSD and not the rare occasion where conspiracy theorists can say “just because I am paranoid, doesn’t mean I&#8217;m wrong.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I had the privilege to learn from a great Torah scholar and teacher. Her name is the Honorable Dr. Rabbanit P’nina Neuwirth, and she helped found an organization called Beit Hilllel. The speech was magnificent for a few reasons, starting with the content. I can&#8217;t do it justice here, but it is worth sharing the three minute version of her 30 minute presentation. It’s relevant to another thing I’ve been meaning to write about, so hopefully this essay will spawn a discussion about both.</p>
<p>In Genesis, Adam’s wife is given two names. First she is called Isha, and later she is called Chava. A careful reading of the verses shows that God names her Isha, and Adam names her Chava. Adam only gives her a name after the sin and the resulting punishments. Adam declares her the <em>“em kol chai,&#8221;</em> mother of all life, and therefore she is called Chava. This set of facts is troubling on several accounts. One big question is, why doesn&#8217;t Adam call her Isha? Also, why is he calling her the “mother of all life” after her punishment of difficult childbearing? It seems awfully insensitive.<span id="more-9260"></span></p>
<p>In the commentary Akeidat Yitzchak, Rabbi Yitzchak Arama explains these names as representing two ideals. The name &#8220;Isha&#8221; represents the complete woman: she has both a religious destiny and a maternal destiny. Man and woman are meant to have equal roles as Ish and Isha. The name &#8220;Chava&#8221; only includes the maternal destiny, &#8220;<em>em kol chai.</em>&#8221; <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/05/28/fresh-new-frum-feminism/nausheen-bigstock-feminism-symbol-60217055/" rel="attachment wp-att-9261"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9261" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nausheen-bigstock-Feminism-Symbol-60217055.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="nausheen-bigstock-Feminism-Symbol-60217055" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>After Chava causes Adam to sin, they are both punished. Adam believes he made a mistake about the role of his partner. He regrets trusting her with his spiritual destiny, so he condemns her to a life of only motherhood.</p>
<p>The plan was for man and woman to have equal roles in spiritual and parenting destinies, but Adam made the error of stripping away the spiritual destiny of his wife by calling her Chava. According to Rashi, the prophet Jeremiah predicts that the Messianic age will be identifiable by women courting men as if they are equal.</p>
<p>Rabbanit Neuwirth argues for the dual true destiny of women. Women are not meant to be either spiritual or maternal, but both.  A few centuries ago, it seemed like women may never have the opportunity to achieve their spiritual or religious destiny, but as the Messianic era draws nearer, women are returning to their dual roles, as originally intended.</p>
<p>A very similar Frum Feminist (Wo)Manifesto is the thesis of a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1614653992/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1614653992&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=CXXELODW4OOWQEN3" target="_blank">Circle, Arrow, Spiral: Exploring Gender in Judaism</a> by Miriam Kosman. This is one of the most nuanced books I have ever read by an Ultra-Orthodox author, and it is so intricately packed that unpacking it properly requires that one actually read it.</p>
<p>In essence, Kosman argues that the famous Midrash about the sun and the moon in the primordial days of creation is a metaphor for man and woman. The original plan was for sun and moon to be equal, but the moon was unhappy splitting duties with the sun, so God made the moon smaller. In the days of the Messiah, the moon will again be like a second sun. Similarly, Kosman argues based on a book called “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568713770/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1568713770&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=OSHI6LHVAMTP5P3B">The Moon&#8217;s Lost Light</a>,” man and woman were meant to be equal, but woman sinned, so God made her subservient to man. In the days of the Messiah, woman will begin to return to the intended state of equality and will achieve that equality when the moon is restored to its glory.</p>
<p>Kosman builds an entire concept of gender roles based on this Midrash. That seems a bit tenuous to me because there is no support elsewhere for the idea that the sun/moon Midrash is about gender, but let&#8217;s accept it for now. The book contains a lot of contradiction, and doesn&#8217;t actually answer as many questions as it claims to answer, but it’s a valiant attempt. I definitely recommend it. It is thought provoking and worth a read. The book argues that woman is crawling her way back toward equality, and that’s a good thing, even according to Torah and Chazal. This is virtually the same concept as the Frum Feminism of Rabbanit Neuwirth.</p>
<p>To me, the most important development is the acknowledgement of the reality for Orthodox women. Both Rabbanit Neuwirth and Mrs. Kosman are forthright about the problems with our entrenched gender roles. Until recently, the most common Orthodox approach to this issue has been that the Torah thinks women are better than men, and that’s why men must be so publicly and actively engaged in Jewish observance while women are exempt. This is a nice soundbite, but the blessing of “shelo asani isha” throws a wrench into it.</p>
<p>The New Frum Feminism of Rabbanit Neuwirth and Mrs. Kosman is definitely an improvement. From a darshan&#8217;s perspective, the Modern Midrash of these ideas is awesome. I&#8217;m glad someone acknowledges that women have been traditionally treated as second class citizens, and doesn&#8217;t attempt to whitewash the historical inequalities in Judaism. This can empower Orthodox Jewish women to proactively seek more public roles. However, from a liberal perspective, I find their resignation to the status quo a little troubling. They seem to be saying that full equality is not for us to create, and that we should wait patiently for Messianic times.</p>
<p>My personal approach is similar to this New Frum Feminism, but I take it a little further. Orthodox Jewish gender roles are fifty years behind American gender roles. It&#8217;s the Mad Men era. We are not “there” yet, but we are also not Neanderthals, Ancient Greeks, Victorians, or pre-suffrage Americans. I am hopeful, because in the grand scheme of human civilization, fifty years is an entirely bridgeable gap. I believe it&#8217;s on us to take our community the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Despite our differences, I see Rabbinit Neuwirth as an ally for more progressive Orthodox Judaism, especially for women. Mrs. Kosman is harder to pin down, but I think she too is helpful to the cause. Read their works, teach their ideas, and help restore the proper order to humanity: equality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All across America, fewer young people are choosing to keep the faith in which they were raised. Orthodox Judaism is familiar with this phenomenon. For about two decades, this issue has been at the forefront of our collective consciousness. It&#8217;s safe to say that every American Orthodox Jewish community, including the most insular communities, has seen this happen. I think almost every community has adopted some measures as attempts to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Each community reacts differently. Some have relaxed academic standards, others have encouraged non-conformist schools, and others have retreated inward to protect from the perceived onslaught of the outside world sucking people into a vortex of darkness. For every problem, there are multiple solutions. Every solution can create new problems, but this is life. There is no silver bullet. The best solution might be simply that solutions are being sought.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also learned about trauma, abuse and triggers, poor parenting and dysfunctional relationships, bad education and harmful teachers. Many communities are vaguely aware of some of the factors that can turn a young person away from Judaism. Some communities have even organized seminars to uproot entrenched ideas that can damage our children.<span id="more-9242"></span></p>
<p>Lakewood is a city built around a Yeshiva, Beth Medrash Govoha. It is the fastest growing non-chasidic, charedi community. The numbers are staggering.  The focal point of the city is an institution of passionate <em>avodas Hashem, </em>genuine <em>yiras Shamayim,</em> and<i> </i>steadfast learning of Torah. It&#8217;s the highest common denominator. People in Lakewood are generally not &#8220;frummer&#8221; than the yeshiva. It&#8217;s the gold standard.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/05/19/some-suggestions-for-lakewood-nj/rasaljo1901to1907a/" rel="attachment wp-att-9244"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9244" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Rasaljo1901to1907a.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Rasaljo1901to1907a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>With such growth, more and more people living in Lakewood are not BMG material. They live very frum lives, but the flavor and the values are a little less intense than BMG. Some men wear clothing unacceptable in the yeshiva, like polo shirts, colored oxfords, even jeans. Some women in Lakewood adhere to halachic standards, just not Lakewood standards. These are families that would not be devastated if their children attended university and pursued careers. Their homes have internet access and they use smartphones. Since the leadership of the yeshiva remains the leadership of the town, at times, there&#8217;s a slight disconnect between the wider public and the rabbinic leaders.</p>
<p>One communal issue with differing approaches relates to rebellious teens who are struggling with faith and observance. A group like this hangs out on the Lake Carasaljo boardwalk. These are local kids who live at home, but do not conform to community standards in dress or observance. Some of the neighbors are uncomfortable with the scene, but handle it as best they can. Others, especially those who are more insular, feel that the atmosphere at the lake is a breach of <em>kedushas</em> Shabbos, and an elevation of <em>kedushas</em> Shabbos is necessary to restore balance in the spiritual realm.</p>
<p>This past Shabbos, <a href="http://images.onlysimchas.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2015/05/IMG_0341.jpg" target="_blank">the yeshiva organized a protest</a>. A group of about 200 rabbis and young men walked to the lake dressed in their Shabbos garb. They wanted to bring a feeling of respect for Shabbos back to the lake, so they sang religious hymns as they marched through the hangout. The teens found it amusing and somewhat disturbing. A few videos of the event have been floating around the Internet (NSFVF), and at some point the police arrived to disperse the crowd.</p>
<p>I understand the need to elevate Shabbos with a statement of protest in defense of Shabbos, but this protest is for the benefit of the protestors, not the kids at the lake. I don&#8217;t think anyone really believes the protest will convince anyone to keep Shabbos. The protest is for the Shabbos observers to counterbalance the <em>chillul </em>Shabbos in their city, but there are also negative consequences. I think it&#8217;s likely that this protest will further disenfranchise some of the kids at the lake. It also adds discomfort to the frum people of Lakewood who don&#8217;t agree with this tactic.</p>
<p>More importantly, in Lakewood proper there are no yeshiva day schools or high schools that officially teach a more moderate version of Orthodox Judaism. The only thing that locals are offered is the most insular version of yeshivish Judaism, even if that is not how they practice at home. For a student who is not succeeding in the top tier yeshiva, there is no other option. It seems that this is another area of significant divide between leadership and layperson.</p>
<p>I would like to make a few recommendations. I am not urging massive overhaul or reevaluation of core Lakewood values. I am urging a reevaluation of priorities and efficiency.</p>
<p>Firstly, if you want to engage the teens at the lake, I suggest doing so in their own language. It&#8217;s potentially damaging to march through their hangout area and basically ignore them while singing religious tunes. It feels like they are not being spoken to as people, only being demonstrated against. It would be more effective to find the right people to have some conversations with these kids. Be their friends. Generally, people don&#8217;t provoke or offend their friends. Maybe the kids will be more sensitive to the community if they feel like they are welcome as part of the community. Further, where are these kids going to be if they are not at the lake? It&#8217;s probably better that they are out in public in Lakewood than exiled out of the city on Shabbos with no idea what they&#8217;re doing.</p>
<p>Secondly, it&#8217;s time for an honest discussion about the viability of insularity in a giant community like Lakewood. The hardcore yeshiva people might be able to pull it off, but there are far too many people in the city who don&#8217;t buy into that lifestyle. Enforcing the more insular standard on everyone is basically begging people to rebel. For some, the rebellion is merely shirt color; for others it can be far more egregious. It&#8217;s unhealthy to enforce a lifestyle that makes so many &#8211; even people who diligently follow Halacha &#8211; into rebels. People need to be able to keep their legitimate brand of Judaism without feeling like they are black sheep. Maybe it would be helpful if the rabbinic leadership of the yeshiva community sanctioned a yeshivish non-BMG community with its own leaders and community standards. They would have still strict halachic standards like other yeshivish communities, just less strict in non-halachic norms. Most importantly, a more diverse school system should be established. I have a feeling that would be very helpful.</p>
<p>The Shabbos March is a visceral example of some of the social issues in Lakewood. It is not the actual issue, but perhaps the entire saga could inspire some adaptation and adjustment for the benefit of everyone in Lakewood.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When things are too difficult to comprehend, we have a tendency to focus our attention on a smaller detail that is part of the story. The Baltimore riots and their social environment are incomprehensible to many people. But within the broader story are mini-stories that we do understand. To me, the anecdote that has become the distraction from the Baltimore riots is the story of how one mom, Tory Graham, saw her son joining the rioters so she ran out to pull him away. As she pulled her son away from the mob, a camera captured her passionately yelling at him and striking him with her hands on his upper body and his head.</p>
<p>The public and the media fell in love with her and her story. It wasn&#8217;t long before she was being called #momoftheyear for pulling her son away from the rioters.<span id="more-9212"></span></p>
<p>When #momoftheyear was first being reported, I think it was mostly to great praise. People were proud that she &#8220;saved&#8221; her son from joining the mob. He was about to do something he might regret and she prevented it. That&#8217;s heroic.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/04/30/lessons-we-can-learn-from-momoftheyear/unnamed-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-9213"><img class="alignright wp-image-9213 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=506%2C257" alt="unnamed-3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Later, I heard some more thoughtful and complex ideas in the media and on social media. &#8220;If she was a good mom he wouldn&#8217;t have joined&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/04/30/baltimore-mother-toya-graham-hero/80sxXZEBSwz156H8GfLXMI/story.html">it&#8217;s terrible parenting to beat your child</a>&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/29/why-is-america-celebrating-the-beating-of-a-black-child/">white people only cheer a black mom if she is beating someone</a>.&#8221; There is certainly at least a dash of merit to all these points.  Some are more meritorious than others, but these analyses are far more introspective and insightful than anointing someone #momoftheyear based on a 30 second video.</p>
<p>I think something a little deeper is happening here too. Stories usually operate on multiple planes. One plane of a story includes every possible context that may have a connection to the story. It can go back to the beginning of time and include every event in history. Another plane looks at a story with limited context. Only the super relevant stuff is part of the story.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another plane that ignores all context to an event and includes just the event as it was seen. Clearly, this is unfair to the people in any story because it&#8217;s far too easy to misunderstand or misinterpret events with no context. If I see someone push another person, they are a bad person. When I see the car speeding into the person who got pushed, the pusher becomes a good person. Despite the inherent lack of truthiness to an event without any context, it has independent value as a &#8220;moment.&#8221; The truth of a &#8220;moment&#8221; is not important. A moment can arouse feelings or explain something or ask questions. It exists on a plane that does not operate within the true / false paradigm. It&#8217;s art.</p>
<p>As a &#8220;moment,&#8221; #momoftheyear was powerful, moving, and visceral. It made us feel something, maybe it was a parental connection to the Baltimore riots, and the thing we felt was good. There&#8217;s value in paying attention to the &#8220;moments&#8221; that move us and the things they make us feel. This also might explain our celebration of #momoftheyear and elevating her to hero status. We may have translated the good feelings of that &#8220;moment&#8221; into a modern fête of #momoftheyear.</p>
<p>But as a parenting story, a mom story, I don&#8217;t think it makes an ounce of sense to consider this mom a hero for anything beyond that &#8220;moment.&#8221; We know that it&#8217;s definitely wrong to beat your kids. We have no idea if she is a good mom in general or if her parenting was a factor in her son&#8217;s potential involvement. We also know that black people being beaten by authority is a significant social issue, especially in Baltimore. Therefore, the ensuing discussions of these issues in the context of #momoftheyear are useless at best and juvenile at worst.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s worth deescalating the rhetoric about #momoftheyear (or #worstmomever, if you see it that way) as a person or parent and instead we should focus on what this &#8220;moment&#8221; has brought to the consciousness of our culture. To me, the #momoftheyear &#8220;moment&#8221; was powerful on its own, but it carries with it some very important conversations about more general issues. The conversations have played out in the media and social networks, digital and non-digital. I&#8217;ve been reading and hearing a lot of opinions. Some have been great. Others have been disturbing.</p>
<p>I am appalled by people who still believe it is okay to beat children or teens. The mere thought brings me to tears. Education through fear is a nearsighted and selfish way to parent. Fear does not teach lessons or values. It teaches fear. The worst kind of fear based education is corporal punishment. Inflicting pain on anyone makes me extremely uncomfortable. It must be absolutely necessary to cause pain to another before crossing that line. It is never necessary for a parent to strike a child. Most of the time, hitting children is a way for a parent to vent or find an easy &#8220;solution&#8221; to a challenging problem. It&#8217;s actually pathetic. I cry when I think about children being hit by adults. If you hit your kids, please stop. If you don&#8217;t stop, please stop telling people how great it is to hit your kids.</p>
<p>I am appalled by people who think that a wayward child or teen is a reflection of the parents or their parenting. This is always true, but it is especially true when the waywardness is religious waywardness The best parents in the world have children who stray or act immorally. Children are people too. Ever person has their own struggles and there are no magical ways to parent out of every issue. Further, we don&#8217;t always know what a good parent does or what good parenting looks like. When it comes to religious choices, sometimes the best choices for that person are not religious choices. We will never have enough information to make that judgment about others. Stop making that judgment.</p>
<p>I am appalled by people who think they can make wholesale judgments about people based on a tiny slice of a person&#8217;s life. We have to learn how to give less value to the small sliver we see of people&#8217;s lives in short video clips. The world is changing and our worst moments are going to be playing on phones and larger screens. We can&#8217;t prevent that. But we can determine what we think when we see tiny slices of people&#8217;s lives. My opinion is that we should try to undervalue those &#8220;moments.&#8221; They lack context and cannot be trusted to tell a complete story. They should be treated that way.</p>
<p>If #momoftheyear inspires us to improve in these three areas, maybe she will truly earn her honorific. Perhaps more importantly, we should refocus our collective attention on the more systemic failures that have been exposed by the unrest in Baltimore. Let&#8217;s not forget, that&#8217;s the real story here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kosher Switch has been in development for several years. According to the inventor, the device replaces the standard light switch and through the magic of technology and Jewish law allows Shabbat observant Jews to switch their lights on and off. Last week, the company launched a campaign on Indiegogo to raise funds to satisfy minimum manufacturer requirements and begin production. The promotional video claims that leading rabbinic authorities approve the device for Shabbat use. In response, a proclamation signed by prominent American rabbinic authorities warned residents of Flatbush that the device was not kosher for Shabbat use and it should not be brought into one&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>A lot of the subsequent discussion has been somewhat juvenile. Questions about motive, credibility, and consistency have been raised in all directions and accusations of impropriety have been levied as well. To me, this is all just a distraction from the real issue here: <strong>Is the Kosher Switch Kosher? [Please show your work]</strong></p>
<p>Instead of delving into the religio-legal issues raised by the Kosher Switch, I find far too much of the discourse to be declarative and even in the rare case that arguments are made in favor or against the device, the articles read like persuasive briefs instead of dispassionate legal jurisprudence. I have read everything I could find and would like to present both sides of the issue as I see it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Needless to say, this discussion is for educational purposes only. If you are looking for a psak, ask a posek.</strong></em><span id="more-9185"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Prohibition</strong></p>
<p>I. Flipping a light switch on Shabbat might be a Biblical prohibition, but according to many opinions it might be a rabbinic prohibition.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9190" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/electricity-05.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="electricity-05" data-recalc-dims="1" /> If it is Biblical, one set of principles applies, and if it is rabbinic, another package of principles apply. Activating a circuit is presumed to be prohibited, but as has been noted, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to identify the actual prohibition. Lighting an incandescent bulb is the most likely candidate for Biblical prohibition due to the heating of the coils and the heat that it emits. But we live in a fluorescent world, and I think we can assume that the Kosher Switch is trying to solve a rabbinic problem as opposed to a Biblical problem.</p>
<p>II. The Torah forbids mindful acts of Shabbat desecration. Thus, there are several leniencies that can theoretically mitigate Biblical prohibition. When one performs an action that unwittingly causes a prohibited result it is permissible. This is called davar sh&#8217;eino mitkaven. But the leniency only applies as long as the unintended result was not inevitable, otherwise it is prohibited. This principle is called psik reisha, and the action is Biblically prohibited. However, if the unintended result of the action is undesirable it is called a psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei and it is not Biblically prohibited. There is a dispute among the Medieval commentators whether a psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei is still rabbinically prohibited or if it is permissible.</p>
<p>III. There is a secondary dispute among the late Medieval and Renaissance commentators when a psik reisha only produces a rabbinically prohibited result. Some say it is still prohibited rabbinically, and others say it is completely permissible. Even those who prohibit in these cases may allow psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei. Some prohibit even in such cases, and others only allow under certain conditions.</p>
<p>IV. When it&#8217;s unknown if the psik reisha resulted in a prohibition it is called a safeik psik reisha. One late Renaissance opinion holds this would not even be considered a psik reisha, and is not prohibited at all. One Contemporary authority rules that safeik psik reisha is permissible when the result is rabbinically prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Proximate Cause</strong></p>

<li>Indirectly causing a prohibited result is called grama. The Talmud offers two seemingly contradictory positions on grama. One is permitted to place vessels filled with water in the path of a fire. The fire will be extinguished by the water in the vessels, and extinguishing fire is normally prohibited. The Talmud explains that this is a permissible case of grama. However, the Talmud also prohibits tossing wheat with its chaff into the wind to separate the kernel from the chaff, even though that appears to be a grama as well. Several narrowing definitions of grama have been proposed to reconcile this issue.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>When there is a time lapse between the action and the result it is considered a grama. It will take some time for the water to be released from the vessels but the chaff will be removed from the wheat almost immediately.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is only when the indirect cause is the normal manner in which the result is achieved. Normally, one would not extinguish a fire by placing vessels of water in its path, but one <em>would</em> toss wheat in the air to winnow.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is only when the person completes the indirect act, and an intervening act is still needed to cause the prohibited result. The water is trapped in vessels that are a distance away from the fire, so the fire must travel and burst the vessels.  In the case of the wheat, the wind is <em>already</em> blowing when one throws the wheat in the air.</li>
<li>Or perhaps grama is only when the prohibited result is not inevitable. There is no guarantee that the fire will be extinguished by the water in the vessels but it&#8217;s certain that the wind will remove some chaff from the wheat.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Grama is not a blanket permission. The general consensus is that grama is only allowed in cases of great need. Some Modern and Contemporary authorities hold that grama would also be permissible when the result is not desired.</li>
<li>One Contemporary rabbinic authority holds that oneg Shabbat (pleasure of Shabbat) is considered a great need.   <strong><br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Not Even a Grama</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>The foremost Renaissance halachic authority for Ashkenazi Jewry says one can leave a candle near a door if the wind is not blowing, even if the wind will eventually blow. He also holds that grama is only permissible in cases of financial loss, and since here he makes no such stipulation, it can be assumed that he holds this is not even a case of grama.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is when the other contributing factor causing the prohibition exists. But where the wind is not blowing, the thing that is needed to complete the act does not even exist at the time of human act.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is when the human act is <em>connected</em> to the thing that will complete the prohibited act. The human is only opening a door to let the wind blow. The wind is the thing doing the extinguishing and the act is not connected to the wind.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Kosher Switch</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Basically, two things are happening inside the Kosher Switch. First, there is an emitter and a receiver that complete a circuit. When the emitter and receiver are active, the circuit is complete and the light is on. The second component is a barrier that creates a blockage between emitter and receiver when the switch is flipped.</li>
<li>When the light is on, the emitter and receiver cycle through sleep and active periods and an indicator will tell the user when they are asleep. The user will move the barrier by flipping the switch, and at a random time, the emitter will try to connect to the receiver. If it cannot connect, the circuit will be disrupted and the light will turn off. When the emitter and receiver are sleeping, an indicator tells the user it&#8217;s safe to move the switch. If the barrier is moved, the emitter and receiver will communicate at a random time and will attempt to complete the circuit. Even when the barrier is removed, the emitter and receiver do not automatically connect. They both randomly generate codes that must &#8220;match&#8221; in order to complete the circuit. After each failed attempt, the emitter will try connected again at a random time. If the barrier has not been moved, the emitter will not see the receiver and the light will remain off.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Show Your Work</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Flipping the Kosher Switch does not directly turn the lights on or off.<img class="alignright wp-image-9188 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/KosherSwitch1.jpg?resize=449%2C600" alt="KosherSwitch1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></li>
<li>Assuming it is considered a psik reisha, the result is a rabbinically prohibited act. This is permissible according to some authorities.</li>
<li>Assuming a psik reisha that produces a rabinically prohibited act is still prohibited, the act of flipping the switch might be a safeik psik reisha. This is permissible according to some authorities.</li>
<li>It might be a grama because there is a time lapse between the switch flip and the circuit completing.</li>
<li>It might be a grama because an intervening act, by the emitter and receiver, is needed to complete the circuit.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s possible that it could be a grama because the Kosher Switch is not the normal manner one turns on a light. Maybe.</li>
<li>If the light is considered oneg Shabbat, grama plus a &#8220;great need&#8221; would render the switch permissible according to some.</li>
<li>It might not be a grama at all, because the current is totally dead at the time of the act. Non-grama is certainly permissible.</li>
<li>Or it might not be grama at all because the human act is not connected to the emitter and receiver. The human act only connects to the switch and barrier.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Objections</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Rabbi Rozen says: &#8220;Even if they added to the ‘Grama’ additional apparatuses, and even if there is a one in a thousand chance that the action will not occur, I have received from my rabbis (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and R. Shaul Yisraeli) that this does not change in any way the halakhic status of regular ‘grama’ (just like grama D’grama and other artificial arrangements).&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Rozen says: &#8220;Even if the method of operation is non-active from the point of view of the agent, i.e. because he merely removes the “preventing element,” Rabbi S. Z. Auerbach and others wrote that this remains forbidden and is treated like it was done directly by the person, since the action occurs immediately after the human intervention/action. Even if the result comes only after a delay caused by an additional factor, this is plain grama, which is still not permitted L’chatchila.&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Student argues that the Kosher Switch is only a grama according to some opinions and even a grama is not permissible ab initio.</li>
<li>Rabbi Tzvi Ortner says: &#8220;We must question whether a case can be built for permissibility based on what the Gemara does not say. That is, the fact that the Gemara does not speak of the halacha of something that has not entered the world does not prove that this case is less than a grama. Perhaps this case is deemed a grama too!&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Tzvi Ortner says: &#8220;Even should this logic be sound, one can hardly call the pulses “not in this world,” since the switch is designed for the function to turn on intermittently. It is an absolute certainty that the force will come back into existence, and this is by design. Even if we could find a case of wind that is not “in this world” that is permissible, this is only because the effect is not under man’s control, which thus “distances” his action from the eventual force (see Magen Avraham 328:53). However, the pulses in the Kosher Switch are designed and controlled by man to arrive with continuity, and thus bear no comparison to the case of the wind, which is beyond his control.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Possible Responses</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Okay, but there is precedent for &#8220;not even grama&#8221; under similar circumstances. Not everyone has to agree with what you received from your rabbis.</li>
<li>Right, but this is a switch that is delayed and also dependent on random emitter and receiver contact which could have legal implications according to some precedents. Further, even if it is a grama, it could be combined with oneg Shabbat to establish a &#8220;great need.&#8221;</li>
<li>There is a solid argument, with precedent, to say that it is not even grama. And again, even if it is grama it might be okay.</li>
<li>The Talmud doesn&#8217;t say it, but the foremost Renaissance rabbinic authority seems to hold this way.</li>
<li>Sure, this is possible. But so is the alternative proposed by Kosher Switch proponents. It might be different than the wind, but it might be similar as well.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So there you have it. A legitimate discussion about Kosher Switch from a religio-legal perspective.</p>
<p>It seems like two things might be happening here. It&#8217;s possible that the opponents of the Kosher Switch did not read through the responsa on the Kosher Switch website. All their questions are covered in their materials. But I think there is something deeper happening here as well. I have a feeling that the Kosher Switch proponents are using a different paradigm than the opponents.</p>
<p>The opponents seem to hold that in order for something to be permissible it needs to work according to all established rabbinic authorities. The Kosher Switch certainly does not meet that bar. Kosher Switch proponents hold that in order for something to be prohibited it needs to not work according to all established rabbinic authorities. Unfortunately, both sides seem to believe that their approach is the only correct approach so they do not acknowledge the validity of their opponents.</p>
<p>This represents a huge gap between two acceptable ways to look at halacha. I do think that the idea that we should try to satisfy all halachic precedent has some roots in the Talmud. But the importance and universal emphasis we give to this idea is somewhat a new innovation. It&#8217;s prominent in the Mishna Berura, a 20th century compilation and commentary on one section of the Code of Jewish Law. The Chofetz Chaim seems to have attempted to select and codify the halachic opinions that were most universally held. Today, the idea is very prominent in Brisk and its progeny. The hallmark of this approach is its lack of self confidence and self reliance. We are nervous that we are not doing it right so we try to fulfill as many positions as possible because one of them has got to be right.</p>
<p>We also have a tradition of &#8220;koach d&#8217;hetera adif&#8221; &#8211; the power to permit is great, and the concept of &#8220;limud zechus&#8221; &#8211; trying to find any halachic path to justify questionable behavior. The Aruch HaShulchan, by Rav Yechiel Michel Epstein, an exhaustive restatement of Jewish law written in the late 19th century, is known for its efforts on this side of the halachic coin. Rabbi Epstein tried to be machria and choose a path but he presented a potpourri of acceptable opinions in every section. It seems that this tradition is less prominent in our society. The hallmark of this approach is autonomy and courage. We try to research a topic as best we can, and attempt to forge a personal path that rings true to our genuinely held religious convictions.</p>
<p>I do harbor some concerns that our preference for the former over the latter is having a net negative impact on 21st century Orthodox Judaism. A society that looks for stringencies and looks down upon those with a different approach to Jewish law can become extremely uncomfortable for its non-conformist constituents. Autonomy and self confidence are authentic Torah values too. We ignore them at our peril.</p>
<p>This dispute might be a case study of this dichotomy or I might be completely off the mark, but either way, researching this topic inspired this idea in me. I believe there is a valid halachic path that permits the Shabbos Switch. I also acknowledge that this path will not be universally held. I think that&#8217;s okay. Variety and diversity can be good things. Let&#8217;s try to bring a little more of that back into our world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s Torah portion outlines many of the laws and precepts regarding Kashrut. Specifically, which animals are fit to eat and which animals are prohibited to be eaten. Kashrut is also the subject of one of the more common conversations between a Kashrut observant Jew and anyone else. That conversation goes something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Taste this [non-kosher food].&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No thanks.&#8221;<span id="more-9168"></span><br />
&#8220;You sure? It&#8217;s really good.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ya, really, I&#8217;ll pass.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Just try it!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not kosher.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Kosher?! You keep kosher!? But you seem so normal!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ya, I keep kosher.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But isn&#8217;t that an archaic law that was about being healthy and staying clean in the desert? Nowadays, we know that pig is safe to eat and shellfish are safe to eat. Why would you keep kosher in 2015?!&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point,<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/04/17/why-do-we-keep-kosher/attachment/1024/" rel="attachment wp-att-9169"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9169" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1024.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> just about every Kashrut observant Jew will almost always say the exact same thing:</p>
<p>&#8220;Kashrut has nothing to do with health! That&#8217;s a myth created by people who just don&#8217;t want to eat kosher! Kashrut is about [insert something spiritual or religious or whatever]. Only super liberal Jews and secular Jews think it is about health!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds familiar, right?</p>
<p>The thing is, this is a lie. Sure, there are plenty of reasons one can propose or concoct for keeping kosher. For some people it is discipline, for others it is mindfulness, for others it is spiritual health, and there are many other reasons.</p>
<p>Maimonides says in the Guide (<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp184.htm" target="_blank">3:48</a>, Friedlander Tr):</p>
<p><em>I maintain that the food which is forbidden by the Law is unwholesome. There is nothing among the forbidden kinds of food whose injurious character is doubted, except pork (Lev. xi. 7), and fat (ibid. vii. 23). But also in these cases the doubt is not justified. For pork contains more moisture than necessary [for human food], and too much of superfluous matter. The principal reason why the Law forbids swine&#8217;s flesh is to be found in the circumstance that its habits and its food are very dirty and loathsome. It has already been pointed out how emphatically the Law enjoins the removal of the sight of loathsome objects, even in the field and in the camp; how much more objectionable is such a sight in towns. But if it were allowed to eat swine&#8217;s flesh, the streets and houses would be more dirty than any cesspool, as may be seen at present in the country of the Franks. A saying of our Sages declares: &#8220;The mouth of a swine is as dirty as dung itself&#8221; (B. T. Ber. 25a).</em></p>
<p><em>The fat of the intestines makes us full, interrupts our digestion, and produces cold and thick blood; it is more fit for fuel [than for human food].</em></p>
<p><em>Blood (Lev. xvii. 12), and nebelah, i.e., the flesh of an animal that died of itself (Deut. xiv. 21), are indigestible, and injurious as food; Trefah, an animal in a diseased state (Exod. xxii. 30), is on the way of becoming a nebelah.</em></p>
<p><em>The characteristics given in the Law (Lev. xi., and Deut. xiv.) of the permitted animals, viz., chewing the cud and divided hoofs for cattle, and fins and scales for fish, are in themselves neither the cause of the permission when they are present, nor of the prohibition when they are absent; but merely signs by which the recommended species of animals can be discerned from those that are forbidden.</em></p>
<p>Clearly, Maimonides held that kashrut laws were about health, and he wasn&#8217;t a secular Jew.</p>
<p>What are we to make of this?</p>
<p>The reasons for commandments are flexible. They change with time, place, medical and scientific advances, and personality. This is unavoidable for many reasons. This is a good thing. The laws are firm and cannot be changed, but the social benefits and ideas they are able to teach us change all the time. We can seek &#8211; we should seek! &#8211; and discover the meaning that subjectively resonates with us and we cannot impose subjective meaning on others.</p>
<p>There are no objective reasons for Torah commandments. There is only subjective speculation. These ideas can only enhance our observance of God&#8217;s word and they cannot be a reason to undermine or violate God&#8217;s word. We have to do it, but we can do it for the reason that works for us.</p>
<p>Kashrut is a huge part of observant Judaism today. It can mean so many different things to different people. It is extremely unlikely that kosher food is part of an undiscovered secret healthy diet and the rest of the world is consuming deadly foods every day. Aside from having no scientific or medical basis dietarily speaking, there is just no way anyone would believe that Jews possess any gastronomic advantage over anyone, especially Ashkenazi Jews.</p>
<p>You want to know why people keep kosher? Ask them. Ask yourself. Research the issue and find something that makes sense for you. Not only is there nothing wrong with that, I think that is what we are supposed to do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a couple of months since I received and read an advance copy of “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555977057/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1555977057&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=ZSXWQP3NS2SCMYY6" target="_blank">All Who Go Do Not Return</a>” by Shulem Deen. It is a very well written book. No simple feat for a New Square educated ex-hasid. It stands out in its very uncomplicated way of conveying very complex emotions and situations. That&#8217;s not an easy task for even the most accomplished writers. As a work or literature, All Who Go Do Not Return deserves the precious 7/8 of an inch it will occupy on my bookshelf.</p>
<p>I read the book in two sittings. To me, that’s the sign of a good read. After reading his book, I talked to Shulem about his story and that conversation influenced my opinion of his book.<span id="more-9157"></span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555977057/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1555977057&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=64M7AXBJCTGOJAZL" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-9158"><img class="alignright wp-image-9158 " src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/71fyz-YNj3L.jpg?resize=274%2C411" alt="71fyz-YNj3L" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Like any memoir, the book touches on so many aspects of life, adulthood, parenting, religion, God, and of course Hasidic culture. One theme in the book felt woven through the entire story: Shulem was the family man who lost his family. In fact, Shulem told me that the thing that his friends from New Square could not understand was how Shulem could choose to lose his family. They didn’t expect Shulem to cling to the theology or observance, but they did expect Shulem to keep his family intact.</p>
<p>Family is a recurring theme in &#8220;All Who Go Do Not Return.&#8221; Shulem had a good relationship with his father and maintains a good relationships with other members of this family. Shulem was also determined to make his “almost arranged” marriage work and he did everything he could do to keep his family together. I cried when I read the end of chapter 6. Describing his marriage after the birth of their first child, Shulem writes: “We had created love.”</p>
<p>When described the experience of losing his faith to me, Shulem compared it to being passionately in love and then one morning the person you loved is gone. But they were never really there in the first place, and one cannot grieve for someone that one realizes never existed.</p>
<p>“All Who Go Do Not Return” also provides a somewhat cynical, but seemingly accurate, depiction of New Square life. Shulem came to New Square as an outsider so his perceptions and insights are invaluable. He can discuss the realities of living in New Square as someone who yearned to join the community, successfully integrated into the community, and one who rebelled and eventually left the community. Even as someone who left, Shulem has a refreshingly optimistic view of the progress being made in New Square. It’s easy to be frustrated by injustice and narrow-mindedness, but seeing incremental progress, as Shulem truly does, is quite admirable.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is no real scandal in his story. Some things are outrageous, but they are presented in their context as if they are almost understandable and reasonable. &#8220;All Who Go Do Not Return&#8221; is an incredibly empathetic book, for the most part. We hear about Shulem’s world from the perspective of an insider even when the insider is frustrated and hurt by the community.</p>
<p>The most important contribution of &#8220;All Who Go Do Not Return&#8221; to the “Coming of Age and Then Leaving Orthodox Judaism” sub-genre is that Shulem genuinely wanted to stay. Other widely read books in the same genre described people desperate to leave for whatever reason or people who needed to leave for more fundamental reasons. Shulem wanted to stay. But he was forced out by the vicious combination of his own disbelief and his community’s intolerance. I don’t mean to say that Shulem would have been better off staying or that he should return to observance in some capacity, I mean that at the time of his choice, leaving was a reluctant admission that he could no longer stay. This is so important. After reading books by the likes of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594483337/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1594483337&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=DXSLGSI2V4RIBL57" target="_blank">Auslander</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802723322/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802723322&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=FJ3J4ZHAPL66NIDU" target="_blank">Brown</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187010/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187010&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=LDZJOZRFGOVW6Y36" target="_blank">Feldman</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038553809X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=038553809X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=HHXWZE6KZSNSIEPU" target="_blank">Vincent</a>, (all books I highly recommend) and other anonymous writers online and in print, it is possible to believe that those who go, go because of trauma or extraordinarily unjust circumstances. But Shulem left when he could no longer stay &#8211; despite wanted to stay. That’s different and more common than I think people realize. This, combined with the lack of scandal make &#8220;All Who Go Do Not Return&#8221; different and give it a unique voice in this ever growing genre.</p>
<p>Finally, as someone who has benefited from the Orthodox Jewish blog community as a consumer and contributor, I read the Hasidic Rebel portions of the story with personal interest. One of Shulem’s first blog post as Hasidic Rebel compared New Square, Williamsburg, and Kiryas Joel to Iraq in terms of oppression and suppression. It’s a brilliant comparison, but more profoundly, it was a revolutionary moment in Orthodox Jewish blogging. An insider armed with a great gift for expression, a computer, and an Internet connection had the power to educate and influence anyone in the world. The Everyman&#8217;s opinion could go viral and change everything. That possibility shifted the entire power structure in Orthodox Judaism. Shulem gets much of the credit for that monumental shift. &#8220;All Who Go Do Not Return&#8221; may be Shulem most prolific and complete contribution to date. Trailblazing the Orthodox Jewish blogosphere will likely remain his most important contribution.</p>
<p>Personally, I am grateful for both. I am also grateful for the many hours of conversation online, and by phone, I have enjoyed with Shulem. It is easy to recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1555977057/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1555977057&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=ZSXWQP3NS2SCMYY6" target="_blank">All Who Go Do Not Return</a>. It is a very good book and a very important book. Shulem’s story is also the story of many other Shulems. At the very least, let’s look out for our fellow brothers and sisters who are going through the challenges Shulem encountered. Let&#8217;s hear them when they cry for our help or sympathy. Let&#8217;s do everything in our power to help any of our brothers and sisters who find themselves in the swirling fires of existential turmoil emerge from the flames unscathed and sheltered in our love for each and every Jew.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This coming week (Vayikra) will be my last week as the rabbi of <a href="http://PJCenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach</a>. To send us off, the Shul is planning a community luncheon and we would love for you to join us.</p>
<p>When our landlord gave us 60 days notice, it gave us a chance to reevaluate our lives and we decided it was time to move on.</p>
<p>We part ways with the Shul on excellent terms. It’s been an incredibly life-changing 6.5 years and I will always be grateful for the opportunity to have been the rabbi of such a historic shul and special community. I have learned so much about myself and others, but above all, I have built memories, friendships, and relationships that will be a part of me forever. The time has come to move on and we are very excited about the bigger and better things ahead.</p>
<p>The Orthodox Jewish community really does not have anything like The Shul on the Beach. A traditional Orthodox service that is accessible and can appeal to people from all backgrounds and perspectives. A place without judgment and a place of warmth and comfort. A place of conscious living and personal growth. A place where everyone belongs. I have been asked about bringing “The Beach to Beverlywood“ &#8211; among other places &#8211; and I am eager and excited to accept this challenge.</p>
<p>Thank you to all of who I met at The Shul on the Beach or at our home in Santa Monica. To those of you who hoped to visit or meet at The Shul on the Beach, of course we would love for you to join us the Next Thing. Meanwhile, The Shul on the Internet lives on.</p>
<p>Fittingly, we just completed the Book of *Exodus* with these words:!חזק חזק ונתחזק</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best advertised features of the Purim story, as told in Megilat Esther, is the absence of God’s name. In fact, the story is perfectly viable without God playing any role in the tale. Much like our lives, the presence or absence of God is impossible to prove or disprove. Some people are able to see God’s trademark in everything, while others are incapable of seeing God in any part of their lives.</p>
<p>In book in the Jewish Biblical canon,  God’s conspicuous absence is particularly striking. These are the books of God, yet God is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, God’s absence in Megilat Esther is even more significant than most people realize.<span id="more-9139"></span><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/03/05/rabbis-hid-god-reason/esther-goes-to-the-king-to-plead-for-the-safety-o/" rel="attachment wp-att-9141"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9141" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Esther-goes-to-the-king-to-plead-for-the-safety-o.gif?fit=600%2C600" alt="Esther-goes-to-the-king-to-plead-for-the-safety-o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Esther was a late inclusion in the Biblical canon. The Talmud says it was written by the Anshei Knesset HaGedolah along with a few other late books. Within a few hundred years, another version of Esther crops up in Greek and Hebrew. One later version has additions throughout the text and these additions are footnoted in another later Esther text. All of the additions share one general guiding principle. They all add God into the story.</p>
<p>For example, Mordechai is shown a prophetic vision at the beginning of the narrative, and it comes true at the end of the story. Also, the prayers of Mordechai and Esther are included in some versions. In the non-Tanach version, God plays a starring role in the scene where Esther breaches protocol and sees the king unannounced. Many of the small additions are found in our Midrashic sources.</p>
<p>This means that our Tanach specifically did not include God in the text of the story, and when we had the opportunity to add it back into the text or to infuse a little bit of religion into the story, we rejected that option. It’s not merely that God wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the Megilah. It’s that God was deliberately omitted from Megilat Esther. Why?</p>
<p>The answers to this question are not really different than the answer to the question of why God is simply not mentioned in the text. Those answers still work. But the question changes, and that means there can also be new and different answers.</p>
<p>God may have been <em>reinserted</em> into the text for religious reasons. But not our religion. Christians also see significance in the story of Esther. Some say she was a proto-Mary. Others say that Esther was a proto-Jesus. Some even say that Esther’s bravery preserved the Jewish people and the Davidic line, which allowed their messiah to be born several centuries later. The point is that Christians used the book for very Christian teachings, and that might be a reason some people inserted God into the text.</p>
<p>At that time, the Christian god was very “present” and the Jewish God was very hidden. Thus, it also might be that the Jewish God of the time was a hidden God while the god of the Christians at that time was thought to be more readily accessible. Between a version of Esther with a hidden God and a version with a very active God, the Jewish path is clear. It was a time of great peril for the Jewish people. Giving up hope in the invisible God likely made the very active god of the early Christians and pagans much more attractive. The rabbis wanted to help avoid that kind of thinking, and instead they wanted to train people to see the Hidden God.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense that the rabbis declined to edit God into the text. They specifically wanted to give the hidden God to the Jewish people. This would be their God for the duration of exile. So the rabbis made the somewhat controversial decision to give us this one book starring a Hidden God. The rabbis of the Anshei Knesset HaGedola were right. Our God is the Hidden God. One day, our God will no longer be hidden, but until then, we have Esther.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/the-lighthouse/.premium-1.632217" target="_blank">was a terrible movie</a>, but that won’t stop me from finding some redeeming value in its new interpretation of the Exodus story. I waited for the Torah readings about the Exodus story in our Torah reading cycle to tackle the most thought provoking aspect of the recent film.</p>
<p>The familiar version of the Exodus story includes a litany of harsh punishments levied by God against Pharaoh and the Egyptian people. Their suffering during these plagues is so immense that we have an ancient custom to spill some wine from our of goblets at the Pesach Seder as we recount each plague to demonstrate our sympathy for their pain. Nevertheless, the story is focused on <em>our</em> pain. We eat matzah to recall the bread of affliction that we ate in slavery. We eat maror to relive the bitterness of our servitude. We dip in salt-water to taste the tears of suffering we endured. In our version of the story, we are the good guys, the Egyptians and the Pharaoh are the bad guys, and God is our Secret Weapon.<span id="more-9112"></span></p>
<p>The movie presents a more objective view.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/01/19/why-did-god-punish-all-the-ancient-egyptians/%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%b3/" rel="attachment wp-att-9114"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9114" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/باانس.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> It tells the story with less self-interest than when we tell it, so we are able to see things in the film that we may normally overlook. I believe it’s a huge flaw in its storytelling that viewers of the film empathize more with Ramses II than Moses (see my review linked above), but it also speaks to a greater challenge the movie presents. We get the sense that the Egyptians are also victims of the Pharaoh. They are not innocent parties, but the average citizen can hardly be held accountable to the degree that Joe the Breadmaker must be made to suffer so greatly. In the film, fishermen do not deserve to be eaten by giant crocs. They’ve done nothing wrong. It is excruciating to hear the primal screams of the mothers of the stricken first borns during the final plague. They don’t deserve that either.</p>
<p>The movie is making a decent point. Great suffering and harm must be justified in order to balance the moral scale. How are we to understand Divine collective punishment? It is disconcerting. I thought we were supposed to be the good guys in the Exodus story? Why is our Secret Weapon causing so much unnecessary suffering?! Perhaps more importantly, what are we supposed to think of all this? Is it okay to even ask this question?</p>
<p>There is something that must be done before suggesting answers to this challenge. We need to establish the validity of the question. If you’ve wondered about this, I salute you. This is a question that has to be asked, and the ability to ask this question is a fundamental skill that has infinite value to me. To step back and wonder if the story demands clarification is important and sophisticated. This is not a childish or rebellious question. This is a genuine question that we should all struggle with. Further, the question is sometimes better than the answers available to us.</p>
<p>I can think of four accepted approaches in Orthodox Judaism:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. All of the Egyptians must have deserved it. God does not punish the innocent and if they were punished they must have been guilty. Here you can be creative about their sins. I call this the Ray Lewis approach. <em>“God does not make mistakes.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2. Some Egyptians deserved it and others were collateral damage. God was punishing the leaders and the oppressors within the Egyptian nation. Once shots are fired, innocents will be harmed. I call this the Hiroshima approach.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3. Only the guilty Egyptians actually suffered from the plagues. In other words, the descriptions of the plagues are generalizations that seem to include every Egyptian. The truth is that only a small number of leaders and oppressors were punished, and their experience is described in the Torah. The innocent were not harmed; only a few guilty parties felt the terror of the plagues, and the rest of Egypt watched in horror. I call this the Selective Anecdote Becoming History approach.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Some argue that collective punishment is moral. Handwringing over death to Egyptians is a corrupt symptom of modernity and we need not think twice about innocent victims. There’s no problem here in the first place. I call this the Old-School Morality approach. <em>“Woe to the wicked person. Woe to his neighbor.”</em></p>
<p>It’s also possible that an indirectly related novel idea I posted on Facebook before Parshat Va’era might reduce some of our anxiety about innocent Egyptians dying.</p>

</div>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Finally, I think there might something else worth exploring. The question we are asking is certainly built on modern sensibilities. I don’t think the ancients were bothered by such concerns. (I could be wrong.) Just a few years earlier, the Pharaoh had decreed that all Israelite males be killed for population control purposes. Clearly, we are dealing with a society that is at odds with our views of morality.</p>
<p><em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> superimposed modern morality on an ancient civilization. It’s not a perfect fit, and the act of forcing them to work together creates collateral damage to the narrative. Judging the way God deals with an ancient civilization with objectionable moral standards using our progressive modern standards of morality is worse than someone who only understands English judging Ugaritic poetry. It’s impossible to do, and if one tries, it demonstrates a lack of maturity.</p>
<p>I don’t think we have to think that God would do the same thing as God did in ancient Egypt. God does not conjure supernatural miracles to punish entire peoples anymore. Meanwhile, the world has changed. The way God interacts with the world could be reflective of the way we act toward each other. Thus, it’s not a problem for me if God’s actions toward an ancient civilization do not square with modern moral standards. I wouldn’t expect otherwise.</p>
<p>This is not to say that we should not even think about this sort of question. On the contrary, we must ask these questions and discuss the various options. The inquiry is more important than the conclusion, and should be encouraged. <em>Exodus: Gods and Kings</em> helped me think about the Exodus in a new way. It invited new questions and new questions invite new discussions and new discussion invite new answers.</p>
<p>This is beauty. This is Torah. This is where we experience the beauty of Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/please-g-d-i-dont-want-a-3rd-temple-a-radical-prayer-from-a-humble-servant/" target="_blank">A recent editorial</a>, written in the style of a letter to God, challenged the notion of animal sacrifices in the Third Temple during the Messianic era. A lot of people were understandably upset by the article. I will not refute or rebut the arguments made against the author and his provocative words. I think a discussion about these issues is valuable and I encourage people to have this conversation.</p>
<p>There are two things that I want to say about the controversy.<span id="more-9099"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame that the uproar over the article, its format, its perceived hubris, and its theological basis has eclipsed its substance, because the substance is so important. <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9100" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Brazen-altar.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Brazen-altar" data-recalc-dims="1" />For about 1400 years, animal sacrifice was a daily part of Jewish life. Some animals were eaten by the Temple staff and penitent pilgrims, but most of the animals were completely burnt on the altar. From the time of the construction of the Tabernacle in the desert until the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE Jerusalem, our ancestors sacrificed animals as per the Torah&#8217;s Divine command. The practice was banned outside the Temple and thus we have collectively prayed and yearned for the return of our Temple and ritual sacrifice.</p>
<p>Many of our communal aspirations and prayers were established nearly 2000 years ago in the wake of our Temple&#8217;s destruction. It&#8217;s understandable that rebuilding the Temple and institutionalizing our national Messianic ambitions are prominent themes in our prayers, because that was the dominant feeling of their era. Persecution and the Diaspora experience have reinforced our desire for autonomy, freedom, and redemption. These feelings are also reflected in the prayers that have been added to our service in the centuries that followed our exile.</p>
<p>Animal sacrifice was normal 2000 years ago, and our prayers matched our society. A lot of time has passed since 70 CE. In the meantime, animal sacrifice has gone out of style in the civilized world. There is not a single advanced country where animal sacrifice is part of the daily routine. It survives in a few cults, tribal religions, and indigenous populations. Other than that, it&#8217;s gone. So it would be really weird and quite uncomfortable for many of us to simply resume a long discarded practice that once seemed moral and virtuous and now seems immoral and primitive.</p>
<p>When we ask God to bring the Messiah and the Third Temple and give us the opportunity to offer sacrifices, do we really mean it?</p>
<p>Generally, I have encountered three approaches to this question. 1. God commands it, ergo it must be moral. If you disagree, it&#8217;s a flaw in your faith or character. 2. The world will be so incredibly different in the Messianic era that although it seems weird today, it won&#8217;t seem weird after the Messiah changes everything forever. 3. Something about mysticism involving lots of thumb-dips and fancy terminology.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the truth: We have no idea what is going to happen, but feeling uncomfortable is completely legitimate and reasonable. You <em>should</em> be troubled at the prospect of taking animals and incinerating them for a non-anthropomorphic God&#8217;s pleasure. Indeed, it boggles our minds, and that is okay.</p>
<p>I wish <em>that</em> was the conversation we were having about animal sacrifices right now. What Rav Kook or the Rambam held or would hold is interesting in theory. But I want to talk about actual factual feelings. How do animal sacrifices make you feel?</p>
<p>This leads me to the other aspect of the &#8220;letter&#8221; that is important to me. We have to be okay with acknowledging that animal sacrifice gives many of us the heebie-jeebies. The absence of a satisfactory answer does not obviate the question, and it is far better to have an unanswered question than the appearance of confidence in an answer that is merely a mirage.</p>
<p>The questions raised in this conversation are tough to answer. We know our Holy Torah tells us that God commands animal sacrifices, we know that this is an anathema to 2015 thinking, and we have no reason to think that 2015 thinking about animal sacrifice is immoral or incorrect. Yet the Torah obligates us. It&#8217;s an infinite loop of truths that cannot be easily reconciled. There&#8217;s a temptation to ignore the tugging at our hearts on this issue, and others. But that would not be honest, and it would not give us the opportunity to embrace the struggle of reconciling Torah and modernity.</p>
<p>Too often, we sweep tough questions under the rug. After a while, the pile of confusion under the rug forms a noticeable bump that the rug can&#8217;t hide. If we ask the questions, acknowledge the challenges, and validate the ones raising issues, our rug stays nice and flat. It&#8217;s a comfortable place to sit, or perhaps even fly, as we ponder and contemplate the difficult questions. Let&#8217;s be honest with ourselves. Let&#8217;s be honest with each other. Let&#8217;s be comfortable with questions even without good answers.</p>
<p>Animal sacrifices in the Third Temple? It&#8217;s not the topic to pen a prayer to God for help in understanding. It&#8217;s something for us to respectfully analyze and discuss together. Be present in the struggle. Putting it on God is the easy way out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://hevria.com/elad/confessions-neo-something/" target="_blank">Writing on Hevria</a>, Elad Nehoral discusses evolving as a person and as an Orthodox Jew. I suggest reading the description of his process in his own words.</p>
<p>To me, it sounds like Elad was uncomfortable confining his religious experience to the Chabad worldview, and has started the process of exploring other versions of Orthodox Judaism. His loyalty to Chabad began to feel like disloyalty to himself, and the dissonance ruined everything.</p>
<p>I admire Elad&#8217;s bravery. I see three significantly courageous aspects in this new chapter of Elad&#8217;s story thus far.<span id="more-9087"></span><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/12/29/are-you-a-destinationist-or-a-traveler/landscapes_nature_men_roads_3888x2592_wallpaper_wallpaper_3888x2592_www-wallpaperswa-com/" rel="attachment wp-att-9088"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9088" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/landscapes_nature_men_roads_3888x2592_wallpaper_Wallpaper_3888x2592_www.wallpaperswa.com_.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> First, he was honest with himself. It takes great personal strength to be self-aware. Many people are unhappy, but they don&#8217;t even realize it or understand why. The reason most of us are self-oblivious is because it&#8217;s so scary to confront our inner conflict. We are afraid to face ourselves. It takes courage, and Elad found that courage.</p>
<p>Relief from discomfort does not automatically follow awareness of discomfort. Sometimes we&#8217;re lazy. Other times, we believe we deserve our unhappiness. Mostly, I think we are scared to make changes. We are scared of God, or friends and family, or mentors and teachers, or any other influential force in our life. Our fear paralyzes us. Elad found the strength to make changes, and that is the second area of bravery.</p>
<p>Making personal changes is difficult, but still private. Publicizing one&#8217;s questions and doubts is scary. Telling the world about unconventional changes takes a lot of guts. We love to scrutinize others, and we think we know how to fix everyone&#8217;s issues. So when someone makes their issues public, we may criticize what we see as wrong decisions. If we&#8217;re kind, we may politely applaud the individual who is sharing their struggles, while reassuring ourselves that we there&#8217;s no need for us to change. Opening the door to this kind of scrutiny is extremely brave. Indeed, many have lauded Elad&#8217;s essay, but not everyone. The criticism can be summarized as &#8220;<em>you&#8217;re not doing it right,&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;it works for me so it has to work for you.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Some people thrive in closed systems, and these people just need to find the right system. The lucky ones are born into a system that already works for them, but many are less fortunate and need to search for their place. There are other people who are simply not &#8220;system people.&#8221; These are the seekers. They&#8217;re not looking for a particular system that works for them,  but seeking for purpose of seeking. It&#8217;s about living without the certainty a system provides. It&#8217;s about the journey.</p>
<p>When we encounter seekers, we so badly want to find them their place, but they <em>have</em> no fixed place! Their place is between places. That&#8217;s where they belong. We get so lost in the vicarious search for their place, that we forget to acknowledge that some people are not looking for a place. We don&#8217;t validate them as seekers. We implicitly tell them that the journey is about the destination, and this tells them that their journey is not valid. Doing this kills people. It kills their souls, their thirst, their love, their potential, their everything. It says to them, &#8220;you are not acceptable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somehow we all need to accept that our religious preferences are subjective, and what works for us might be death for him, and vice versa. We get stuck in our institutionalized versions of whatever it is that we do, and reinforce the false paradigm that we must choose from a finite number of prefabricated boxes. We don&#8217;t accept people in the other box, or we insist that there are no problems in our box. Everything about this is wrong. The boxes are all just an illusion created for the Destinationists who demand certainty and rigidity. They can have their boxes and labels and institutions, but they cannot impose those shackles on the Travelers. Yet, this is precisely what has happened, and it is killing us.</p>
<p>Moreover, I think we are <em>supposed</em> to be Travelers and not Destinationists. Indeed, the Torah is a closed system, but within Torah there is almost an infinite number of paths. There is a reason the Talmud says there are seventy facets of Torah: boxes are a man-made booby-trap, not an ideal. The Torah wants us to choose everything we do, not to feel our Judaism wash over us as we lie asleep in the sand. We should be experiencing the Judaism that speaks to us, culling and curating from an infinite combinations of ideas, rituals, expressions, and flavors. This is how the Traveler lives a Jewish life. This is the ideal. This is being awake.</p>
<p>When I see someone escaping the box and beginning a never-ending personal life journey, I see cause for celebration. This is someone who has woken up and is beginning to choose more personally. This gives meaning to everything they do, and destroys the box that has been killing them for as long as they have been inside it.</p>
<p>There is nothing to fear. Each of us has a special, unique voice in the universal chorus of life. When we give our voice to institutionalized versions of Judaism, it is stripped of its individuality. This is a painful personal tragedy. but also a communal one. We need all of our authentic voices to sing in the chorus. In order to facilitate that, every box must have a door. If there is a box without a door, it must be changed. If someone leaves your box, hug them on the way out, and promise to love them no matter where their journey leads.</p>
<p>Leaving the box and talking about it should not require so much bravery. This option must be available to all Travelers. It must be available to every self-aware, awakened person. Destinationists fixate on the specific things that didn&#8217;t work for the Traveler. They try to fix those particular things, or explain them away, but it&#8217;s not about the &#8220;thing&#8221; at all. It&#8217;s about waking up and not wanting to be stuck in the box. Answers and excuses are not only irrelevant, they show a gross misunderstanding of the dynamics at play.</p>
<p>Judaism does not have to hurt. It should not be painful. Judaism does not have to be dark and scary. It should be pleasant. It should be beautiful. It should be meaningful. It should be yours. If you are awake, it&#8217;s all within your grasp. To get there, the first thing you need to do is forget about ever getting there. Then you are ready to become a Traveler. Join us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s finale season on television these days. Writers try to make the finales the most compelling episodes of the season. The best stories drag us into their narratives so deeply that we feel the emotions of the characters and the lines between fiction and reality become blurred. The story may not be true or real, but the emotions the viewer experiences are very true and very real.</p>
<p>This week’s Torah portion feels like the season finale of the Joseph saga. There’s a tendency to lose focus of the Biblical narrative and forget to experience the story. I make sure to tune in to the Joseph epic every year. It&#8217;s my favorite story in the Bible, and the season finale never fails to emotionally engage me. Joseph’s ancient drama of intrigue, fratricide, conspiracy, love, revenge, forgiveness, and reconciliation has been enthralling us for millennia but it has always been an old story about Joseph and his brothers. I can relate to elements of the story, like any other good story, but it’s always been in terms of “Joseph the person who lived in ancient Canaan with a starring role in a very old tale.”<span id="more-9065"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9068" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/untitled-188-of-272.jpeg?fit=600%2C600" alt="untitled (188 of 272)" data-recalc-dims="1" />I think there is a great need for Modern Midrash. Our old Midrashic literature is rich and full of beautiful insights from a world very different than our own. All good Midrash channels the struggles of the Zeitgeist through the lens of the Bible. Modernity has its own unique challenges that demand our attention, and we should scour the Bible for new interpretations and ideas that speak to our contemporary battles.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of Modern Midrash is Eli Schwebel’s heartfelt Ani Yosef from his Hearts Mind album. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/25/music-review-hearts-mind/" target="_blank">Hearts Mind represents a necessary evolution in the Orthodox Jewish music genre</a>. The last few decades have seen almost no musical innovation and have taken a step backwards lyrically. Ani Yosef and the rest of the album reverse that trend. The exquisite music and lyrics do not sound familiar at all in style or substance. In my mind, that is reason enough to celebrate this musical treasure.</p>
<p>More profoundly, Ani Yosef captures the tension of modern religious struggles spectacularly. It zooms out of the dramatic one-time encounter between Joseph and his brothers, turning his personal struggle into a powerful archetype of a spiritual warrior wrestling with faith and experience. We hear something original in this reinterpretation of the story. It speaks to us in a new way.</p>
<p>I discussed this modern spiritual tension with Eli. He said,<em>“Ani Yosef is my attempt at reconciling my struggle with God, my personal emotional and intellectual walls, my rich Jewish heritage, tradition, and culture, and my unfolding consciousness.”</em> The song was written at a time in Eli’s life where the tension of <em>“trying to fuse a deep sense and knowledge of oneness with the education of a very specific way to connect with God”</em> felt overwhelming. The raw emotion of that moment in Eli’s life is the soul of Ani Yosef.</p>
<p>Today, Finkorswim.com proudly presents the exclusive debut of the Ani Yosef Lyric Video. Behind the bold-faced text in the video, a story is told. This is an almost perfect metaphor for all Midrash. The text is in the foreground, but the interpretation is happening in the background. This video tells a new interpretation of the Joseph story. It’s a Midrash Inception, and in a subtle way, it makes the song’s message even more profound.</p>
<p>I asked Eli about this new artistic Midrash that combines music with Torah, and modern life. Eli grew up singing in the home of a famous singer and is the grandson of a Chazan, which gave him an intense love for music. Their music was most often expressing the sentiment of someone outside the self. <em>“You take a verse, add a tune, and voila, there is a connection. This is the first level, the lowest and the safest.”</em> There is a second level too. It is original. It tells the story of a hero outside the self. The singer steps into the shoes of the hero, almost voyeuristically. <em>“Shloima Carlebach is a great example of utilizing stories and verses as an escape from his deep inner brokenness. But he never explicitly expressed his true self. He never let go and shared his broken heart and shattered soul.”</em> There is yet a third level, when the music becomes a true expression of self. This is what we are missing. It is the place where the inner anguish and torment is displayed with complete candor and confidence. <em>“Where is the Orthodox Jewish Johnny Cash? Who is utilizing Jewish tradition, its symbols, or its Torah to say something intimate?”</em></p>
<p>It has become unfashionable in the Orthodox Jewish community to honestly acknowledge religious struggles. Instead, we’ve created a false binary choice. One is either in or out, seemingly arbitrarily. Challenges and personal struggles are not seriously addressed. Ani Yosef hits this tension in the bulls-eye.</p>
<p>Eli was very candid about this problem.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“The reason the frum world is so scared of this expression is because it speaks to what is perceived as the greatest threat to Orthodox Judaism: doubt. Any sort of doubt is considered blasphemous. The mantra is ’never doubt.’ Meaning, you may not doubt. True art and personal expression can focus and connect the entirety of the human experience, including doubt and darkness, to something beyond our personal experience. But specifically there must be a &#8216;from&#8217; to go toward. If we negate and minimize the from, we lose authentic context. If we negate and minimize our truest, deepest thoughts and feelings, we lose the ability to channel or transcend those feelings. We may feel good at a</em> kumzitz,<em> we may dance, but the artist that awakens something deeper toward something higher, is one that is completely whole with their demons and their power when they express their soul artistically. In the eternal words of the great Bob Dylan, ‘Chaos is a friend of mine.’”</em></p>
<p>Indeed, chaos should be a friend of ours. As a society, we&#8217;ve decided that chaos is our enemy. Joseph&#8217;s life was a life of chaos. Beauty and spiritual growth emerge from chaos; we just have to embrace it.</p>
<p>I asked Eli about his inspiration for the song and the video.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Towards the end of his life, my grandfather Joseph Wassner (another Yosef) and I developed a deep bond as we talked about our ideas and our struggles. This song layers the life of Biblical Yosef, imagining what he must have been going through yearning for his fathers love, dealing with the anger towards his brothers, having to deal with his identity shifting as he takes on an entirely new culture, and his ability to still hold on to the core values by which he was raised. That is exactly what I am trying to do as I discover my place in this world, as my grandfather did, as we all do. The story of Yosef is all of our stories!”</em></p>
<p>I agree. We all need to find Yosef in ourselves. We tend to see the forefathers as larger-than-life figures, and it can be impossible to relate to them. They <em>should</em> be viewed as archetypes of our struggles. We are selling ourselves short by idealizing the Bible heroes, because we lose the ability to connect to them in a meaningful way, which is the whole point. Find yourself in the stories. Find yourself in the Joseph story. You’ll discover that it is really true for you: <em>Ani Yosef</em> &#8211; I am Joseph.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>♫ <em>&#8220;It&#8217;s the most awkward time of the year.&#8221;</em> ♫</p>
<p>For Orthodox Jews, and to a lesser extent, non-Orthodox Jews, the &#8220;Holiday Season&#8221; is certainly the most awkward time of the year. Everyone around us is in a super festive mood, lights and colors of the season are everywhere, and everything seems to somehow connect to the Holidays. Drinks at your coffee shop change, the decor in all the stores, all the music, movies or television programming morph into Holiday Season themes. I was at the Third Street Promenade this week and one Holiday tune was blasting in the first store I entered. A few minutes later, the same song started playing in the next store. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/15/tis-the-season-to-be-sparring/" target="_blank">Even Disneyland feels completely different</a>. It&#8217;s unavoidable.</p>
<p>This season makes me somewhat anxious, and I am sure it makes many other people feel uncomfortable.<span id="more-9041"></span></p>
<p>There are three general approaches to dealing with this discomfort.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9045" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/christmas-tree-dreidel-somethingmarissa1.jpg?w=980" alt="christmas-tree-dreidel-somethingmarissa1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Some people embrace the dominant culture and assimilate further into American identity. Others use it as a justification for completely opting out of the dominant culture. They engage with the outside world sparingly, if at all, and avoid the discomfort completely. There&#8217;s also a group of people who do indeed engage with the outside world. They are aware of the Holiday Season. They imbibe in its non-religious flavors, but for the most part, they also are very careful not to allow the outside influences contaminate their religious celebrations this time of year. This group might enjoy a Holiday movie but would never dream of putting lights on the outside of their home in the Holiday spirit.</p>
<p>I think the second and third groups are made up of people with strong Jewish identities and mostly affiliated Jews who are fairly observant. These two groups treat the non-Jewish Holiday Season as somewhat prohibited or a guilty pleasure. Most agree that the outside influences of the Holiday Season don&#8217;t have a seat at the Jewish Holiday table. There are debates and discussions about presents, ridicule for Hanukah Bushes and Hanukah Harry, a complex about the way Chanukah seems a lot like Jewish Christmas, and a value system that discourages anything that &#8220;smells&#8221; non-Jewish.</p>
<p>I think there is a fourth way. <em>We should not be fighting the Holiday Season. We should be leveraging it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Here are the rules:</strong> If it&#8217;s prohibited by Jewish law, don&#8217;t do it. If it is not prohibited by Jewish law, and it enhances your Chanukah experience, you should do it. If it does not enhance your Chanukah experience, but might enhance it for others, or help you cope with Holiday Season angst, do it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s widely considered taboo for Jews to put up Chanukah lights on their homes because it&#8217;s &#8220;not Jewish.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not <em>not</em> Jewish and nothing we do on Chanukah is &#8220;Jewish&#8221; besides the rabbinic obligation to light candles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotum" target="_blank">Dreidel is not Jewish</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_pancake#Polish_tradition" target="_blank">Latkes are not Jewish</a>. Sufganiyot are mostly likely not Jewish (Muslims have celebrated Eid with donuts for centuries and sufganiyot are a variant of the Jewish donuts from Arab countries). Many people consider gifts not Jewish. Plenty of Chanukah stuff is not Jewish. It seems silly to say that we&#8217;ve adopted customs from the outside but now we can&#8217;t anymore. Be honest. Dreidel, latkes, sufganiyot and gifts came from the outside as a consequence of Jewish people assimilating a non-Jewish practice into Chanukah. It&#8217;s been happening for hundreds of years. Somewhere along the way, we decided nothing else from the outside would be kosher. I think this is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>The reason all those foreign rituals were adopted was not because a rabbi-gician performed a spiritual-oscopy and deemed these kosher customs. It happened because people liked the stuff they saw other people doing on their special days and they added those things to Jewish days. It&#8217;s not complicated. More importantly, it was a good decision! Nowadays we refuse to add things from the Zeitgeist to our Judaism, and I think this is hurting us. We should be leveraging the Holiday spirit and its flavors to improve our Jewish experience. There&#8217;s no good reason not to decorate your home for Chanukah. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to showcase <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/10/martha-stewart-judaism/" target="_blank">Martha Stewart Judaism</a>™. A Chanukah home should look at least as festive as a Christmas home. After all, we already call it the Festival of Lights.</p>
<p>I think this is actually one of the secrets of Jewish survival. Instead of assimilating into the outside culture, we&#8217;ve created a system of assimilating the outside culture into Judaism. We take their good ideas and Jewify them. That&#8217;s one way of crafting positive Jewish experiences. The Seder is one example of a non-Jewish experience, Symposium, that we made better and more Jewish. We&#8217;ve done this a million times and we stop doing it at our own peril. This is an integral part of our survival strategy. It would be unwise to jettison it. Every December we should leverage the festive mood, not fight it.</p>
<p>We should not have to choose between prohibition and guilty pleasures. We should embrace the festive season and make Chanukah awesome. Let&#8217;s be totally honest and say that Christmas looks like a lot of fun to the outsider so we thought it would be smart to incorporate some of the spirit into our Chanukah celebration. Same as we&#8217;ve done for generations. Honest. No guilt. Simply a better Chanukah experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Jewish Action published a <a href="http://www.ou.org/jewish_action/12/2014/rekindling-flame-neo-chassidus-brings-inner-light-torah-modern-orthodoxy/" target="_blank">nice report on a phenomenon</a> that is gaining steam in the Modern Orthodox world. The article identifies the movement as Neo-Chassidus and describes it as a path toward connection with God. It stands in contradistinction to other strains of Judaism that are described as dry, cold, and lacking in the deeper joy that Chasiddus has to offer.</p>
<p>To be clear, the Neo-Chassids are embracing the 18th and 19th century versions of Chasidic philosophy and a smidge of practice. They are not converting to contemporary Chassidic sects like Ger, Satmar, Bobov, and Vizhnitz.</p>
<p>This is a great development. Typical Orthodox Judaism artificially constrains people to the customs and philosophy of the sect to which they are born.<span id="more-9030"></span> If you are born a Yekke, you will be a Yekke. If you are born a Hasid, you will be a Hasid.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/12/10/will-the-real-neo-chassids-please-stand-up/v12p066a01/" rel="attachment wp-att-9033"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9033" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/V12p066a01.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="V12p066a01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> If you are born a Litvak, you will be a Litvak. But some people who are born Yekkes would thrive as a Hasid but fail as a Yekke. Some people who are born Litvaks would thrive in a Sephardic environment. It&#8217;s prudent to allow cross-pollination between different versions of Orthodox Judaism. It gives more people a chance to succeed and feel connected to their Judaism. We should definitely encourage people to explore more versions of Orthodox Judaism and allow people the space the find their place along the spectrum of Orthodox Judaism. We should invite people to find the Judaism that speaks most directly to them and allow people to mix and match their Judaism so they can craft a personal experience that feels good and serves their religious needs.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s super awesome that Modern Orthodox kids who are seeking a more spiritual version of Judaism turn to Neo-Chassidus. If that works for them, great. It would be foolish to impose Neo-Chassidus on everyone, but for those who seek it out and find it to be rewarding, the option should be on the table.</p>
<p>While I support the Neo-Chasids, the whole process seems a bit off to me. Chassidus was started as a response to significant social issues within Orthodox Judaism. There was a spiritual malaise across the land. Our laws and rituals had become institutionalized to the point that they had lost their spirit and soul. Judaism became inaccessible to the average person. Something needed to bring passion and purpose to Judaism for everyone. Chassidus answered the call. It spawned enormous contributions to Orthodox Judaism, Torah, and philosophy. These interpretations and innovations addressed the needs of Jews living in Eastern Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. Unfortunately, at some point, these Chasidic expressions of Jewish ecstasy and exultation also became institutionalized. Ironically, organized Chassidic sects are now very similar to the things they were invented to address.</p>
<p>The point is that Chassidus is an answer to a question that was relevant more than a couple hundred years ago. It is not a new answer to new questions and challenges. Some people are inspired by the ideas Chassidus teaches and that&#8217;s perfectly fine. But it seems like a roundabout way of addressing the modern challenges of the Neo-Chassids. Why answer a 2014 question with a 1714 answer? The first Chassids were not satisfied to answer 1714 questions with 1414 answers. That&#8217;s why they created 1714 Chassidus!</p>
<p>So my suggestion is to be more like those first Chassids and less like the 2014 Chassids. Real Neo-Chassidus, in my opinion, is not pantomiming contemporary Chassidus. To me, real Neo-Chassidus proudly adopts a methodology that gifted us with an avant-garde solution to a real problem in 1714. The methodology is the thing we need, not the solutions we crafted using that methodology a few centuries ago.</p>
<p>First, we must identify the issues that challenge 2014 Orthodox Judaism. We have been doing that here and on Facebook while others do the same in a variety of other forums and formats. Then we collaboratively create Jewish experiences that address those challenges. It&#8217;s possible that the answers we come up with will direct us towards institutionalized Chassidus or, perhaps more likely, a deinstitutionalized contemporary Chassidus. But it&#8217;s very possible that our 2014 answers will look and feel and taste different than 1714 answers. Our new answers will look more modern and feel more cosmopolitan and taste more fresh.</p>
<p>Rabbi Norman Lamm writes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592643094/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592643094&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=VRUREVO4SYNITLTK">Torah Umadda</a> that Modern Orthodox Judaism in America is actually a form of Neo-Chassidus. Using the same methodologies that triggered Chassidus, Modern Orthodoxy was crafted to address the challenges of mid-20th century Judaism. I think he&#8217;s right. I also think it&#8217;s time to do it again and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>In light of all this, I propose that the Neo-Chassidus featured in the Jewish Action should be called Retro-Chassidus or Hipster Chassidus. Neo-Chassidus should live up to its name and actually be &#8220;neo.&#8221; Those who are adopting teachings and practices of the 2014 Chassids are not Neo-Chassids. They are Retro or Hipster-Chassids. The group of people who use the methodologies of the first Chassids are the Neo-Chassids. We should be those people. We should engage in this process. We should be the Neo-Chassids. Only then can we be confident that we are properly addressing the needs of the modern American Jew. Only then can we imagine that we might find what the Judaism that we seek. Right now, nothing is more important.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/11/11/rising-from-the-ashes-of-bad-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">I promised an essay on matters of faith in Orthodox Judaism</a>. This is the first of a mini-series (within a series) on faith.</em></p>
<p>To the ancient Greek philosophers and medieval theologians, God&#8217;s existence was taken for granted. There was no debate about whether there was a God. They had two primary areas of dispute: the nature of this God, and the proper way to demonstrate God&#8217;s existence. Thus, we have many interpretations of how God acts and what He wants from man. We also have many arguments demonstrating to Believers that there is a God.</p>
<p>English is a confusing language. For example, take the word &#8220;proof.&#8221; In mathematics, proof A can prove X and therefore X is irrefutable. More often, a proof does not demonstrate objective truth. Usually, a proof is an argument in favor of X and it can be sufficient, insufficient, accepted, rejected, argued against, and teamed up with other proofs for X.</p>
<p>This creates a problem when we moderns discuss the existence of God. Torah literate Jews are accustomed to seeing the word &#8220;proof&#8221; in the context of demonstrating God&#8217;s existence, and there is a tendency to assume  a&#8221;proof&#8221; is objectively determinative. But no God-proofs make an irrefutable point. They were not intended to function that way, and unsurprisingly, neither do they accomplish it.<span id="more-9008"></span></p>
<p>We should stop using the word &#8220;proof&#8221; when we are making arguments in favor of the existence of God. I propose we use the word <em>&#8220;argument&#8221;</em> instead. The proofs for God in Torah literature are <strong>arguments in favor of believing in God</strong>. They are not proofs of irrefutable, objective truth. <em>We believe they are true, but that does not make them mathematically proven.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/12/09/misplaced-faith-in-the-kuzari-principle/887537-110921-house-of-cards1/" rel="attachment wp-att-9011"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9011" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/887537-110921-house-of-cards1.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="887537-110921-house-of-cards[1]" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></em></p>
<p>These days, the most popular &#8220;proof&#8221; for God&#8217;s existence and the Truth of Torah is a version of what is called the Kuzari Principle, derived from The Kuzari by Rav Yehuda HaLevi.  The principle assumes that it is necessarily impossible for a fictional narrative to be widely adopted as historical, divine truth. In the book, this argument is not being used to prove anything about God qua God. It is really about the veracity of the Torah and Judaism, not God.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe Rabbi Yehuda HaLevi intended the modern argument that is made by Orthodox Jews in 2014. The Kuzari Principle is a throw-away line or two hidden in the text. It&#8217;s almost impossible to &#8220;find&#8221; the Kuzari Principle <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Kitab_al_Khazari/Part_One" target="_blank">in The Kuzari</a>! I imagine Rav Yehuda HaLevi would be surprised by the new versions of the Kuzari Principle presented in books like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AFJIUW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001AFJIUW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=DIABLKWXWW4XHEBU">Living Up to the Truth</a>. Further, this argument in The Kuzari is not being made to a true skeptic with modern sensibilities. It is being made to a fictional medieval Believer king whose skepticism is selectively determined by the author of the book. The laundry list of assumptions necessary for the Kuzari Principle to function is long and easily rebutted. One cannot argue that the Kuzari Principle proves the existence of God or the truth of our Torah is irrefutable. This is a certainty.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to write about the Kuzari proof and its flaws and the flaws in its flaws. The Kuzari was attempting to make an argument from logic. He <em>already</em> believed in God. <em>Everyone</em> believed in God. The sole issue on the table was whether Judaism is correct, and the dialogue included the idea that if many people agree about something historical, it&#8217;s almost certainly true. It&#8217;s not a bad argument if you&#8217;re trying to persuade a Believer that Torah is true, but it&#8217;s a terrible argument if you&#8217;re trying to persuade an atheist or agnostic that the Torah is true. It doesn&#8217;t really work. If it does work, it&#8217;s willful blindness or involuntary confirmation bias. Neither are helpful, yet that is precisely what we do. We need to stop making the Kuzari Principle into what it is not.</p>
<p>We should use the Kuzari Principle for what it is, though. It&#8217;s part of a longer conversation about whether it is reasonable for Believers to accept the Torah&#8217;s claims. Beyond that, I think we are doing ourselves a disservice and setting people up for failure.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve witnessed the havoc wrought by misappropriation of the Kuzari Principle. There are plenty of people who base their belief and observance on proofs and are convinced that these proofs are irrefutable. I take no issue with those people. But <em>teaching</em> these proofs as a kiruv tool is destructive. It&#8217;s simple enough to Google dozens of academic level rebuttals of the Kuzari Principle, and the teacher could seem like a gullible fool or a liar. Asking intelligent people to choose between their teachers and the evidence is a recipe for disaster. Eventually people figure it out, and if they have based their belief on a false proof, things fall apart.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Kuzari Principle is dependent on the assumption that people are skeptics. If not, the Kuzari Principle would fall apart because it wouldn&#8217;t be anomalous or noteworthy for a fictional story to be accepted as truth by a large group of gullible people.</p>
<p>To me, this is the greatest lesson of the Kuzari Principle. We are expected to be skeptics. We are presumed to question things that we are told. That&#8217;s the axiom that gets the Kuzari Principle off the ground. So isn&#8217;t it ironic that we use a proof for God and Torah that builds skepticism into its logic but requires suspending disbelief and falls apart under the meager force of the tiniest shred of skepticism? Yes, it is. This was the irony I pointed out when a few dozen of my Facebook friends fell for another hoax.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t about The Kuzari of Rabbi Judah HaLevi. It was about us. It was about our healthy skepticism and lack thereof. <em>I apologize to those who thought I was mocking Rabbi Judah HaLevi or attempting to dismantle the faith of others.</em></p>
<p><strong>There are no proofs that can irrefutably demonstrate that there is a God or that this God wrote the Torah.</strong> Yet, we believe. There are many arguments that can be made to <em>persuade</em> people to believe in God and the truth of the Torah.  I don&#8217;t think the future of Orthodox Judaism will depend on our ability to articulate logical arguments of philosophers and theologians from ancient and medieval history. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/03/why-do-people-leave-orthodox-judaism-why-do-people-stay/" target="_blank">It depends on other things</a>. But, if we <em>are</em> going to teach arguments of Ancient Greeks and medieval rabbis, imams, and priests, we must be honest about their utility and include them in a much broader discussion about faith and God. That discussion must make space for skeptics and skepticism as well.</p>
<p><em>The next essay in this series will further discuss skepticism, faith, and God.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On November 24, 2014, Sony Pictures was attacked by hackers. Attacked is the proper word to describe hacking in this context. The hackers intended to harm Sony financially and instill fear into the hearts of the studio’s executives and employees. Sites like Lifehacker make hacking sound like a cutesy hobby, but it is not cutesy. It is destructive and a form of terrorism.</p>
<p>The victims of the attack feel vulnerable, abused, and angry. Digital burglars stole their personal information and private data. That hurts. Victims deserve our empathy and kindness. The breach itself is enough to cause real pain and suffering, but that is only a small piece of the destruction the hackers have wrought.<span id="more-8991"></span></p>
<p>Every time someone reads a nugget of personal information or consumes media stolen by hackers, the knife is being plunged into their backs again, and again.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/12/04/the-proper-response-to-hacking/cyber-attack-hacker/" rel="attachment wp-att-8992"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8992" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cyber-attack-hacker.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="cyber-attack-hacker" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> The first blow is struck when hackers gain illicit access to private materials. It hurts to be violated. It also hurts that a few anonymous people know things that are supposed to be secret. Blame the hackers for the agony caused by their actual breach and the discomfort they caused by knowing things they should not know.</p>
<p>At that moment, publicly releasing all the confidential information and data has no further inherent negative consequence. That is to say, when hackers leak stolen information, the leak is not the thing that hurts. The thing that hurts is the public imbibing in the leak. If no one would care to taste the forbidden fruit the hackers are dangling in front of us, the victims would suffer no further harm. The leak hurts so much because far too many voyeurs gleefully devour the forbidden fruit. That’s on the voyeurs, not the hackers. That’s not kindness to victims of an attack.</p>
<p>It’s true that the hackers are the thieves. That’s evil. But the rest of us are “in possession of stolen property.” That’s also evil. We understand that viewing child pornography is immoral even though the viewer has not taken the photos or taken advantage of a child. But the demand for depraved images contributes to the market by giving the images value. If no one would look, fewer images would be produced.</p>
<p>Hacking is not the same as child pornography. But the personal violation is similar. No one granted us permission to view these divulged secrets. Hacking would be practically useless if we all agreed to embargo anything that is leaked by the hackers. But we don’t do that. Sadly, there is demand for hacked data. We drive the market. We glorify the hackers and get drunk on illicit access to intimate secrets. Suddenly, we are all Peeping Toms.</p>
<p><strong>I doubt we can figure out a way to stop hackers from hacking. I am hopeful that we can find a way not to look.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a lesson taught very early in the Bible. Upon witnessing the destruction of his world, Noah gets drunk and his sons discover him sprawled naked on the ground. One son stares. Two sons look away and cover their father’s shame. They are praised. The other is cursed. When we are confronted by the shame or nakedness or private information of others, there is only one moral choice. Gawking is a curse. Look away and cover their shame. That’s blessing. It’s what we would want others to do for us.</p>
<p>When hackers steal private information, it’s on us to ignore it. When hackers release pirated movies, it’s on us to go to the theater and pay to see the film. When hackers want to tell us secrets, it’s on us to ignore them. When hackers leak intimate photos of celebrities, it’s on society to look the other way and cover their shame. Our voyeurism is the fuel to the hackers’ fire. If we would just walk away, the fire would burn itself out. When we gawk, we are no longer innocent. We step across the moral line and we become the hackers.</p>
<p>Let’s neuter hacking. Don’t look. Avert your gaze. Respect privacy, especially betrayed privacy. Let’s make our society a place that refuses to drive the hacking market. Let’s care more about the victims of hacking than our prurient curiosity. Let’s not be voyeurs peering luridly into the figurative bedrooms of others as they suffer. Let’s knock on the door, offer our care and concern, and be their security blanket.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">I promised an essay about dealing with negative Jewish experiences.</a> This is it.</em></p>
<p>Orthodox Judaism works for a lot of people. It’s vibrant, exciting, meaningful, and many are proud to live a life committed to Orthodox Judaism. Every version of Orthodox Judaism enjoys this success for the vast majority of its adherents. But every version also has its share of people who have bad experiences. The negative experience could be social, religious, theological, cultural, anything.</p>
<p>Of the people with negative associations towards Orthodoxy, there are two categories. One group will leave, the other will stay. What follows, is not written to convince people to stay. This is an attempt to help people who want to stay, or people who want to help those trying to stay.</p>
<p>I recommend a three part process that has been successful for some people.</p>
<p><span id="more-8968"></span></p>
<p>1. Purge<br />
2. Explore<br />
3. Integrate</p>
<p><strong>It begins with the purge.</strong> The relationship with religious life is heavily influenced by parents and teachers.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/11/11/rising-from-the-ashes-of-bad-orthodox-jewish-experiences/1800184_490114091111077_2051755693_n/" rel="attachment wp-att-8985"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8985" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1800184_490114091111077_2051755693_n.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="1800184_490114091111077_2051755693_n" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> So much so, that many people think they should practice religion <em>for</em> their parents and teachers. The commitment is totally external with zero personal connection. This leads to lax observance. Feelings of guilt, anxiety, and resentment glom onto the cumulative religious memory and begin to cannibalize all other religious associations. Eventually, this person checks out of the religious experience entirely.</p>
<p>This is why it&#8217;s necessary to purge.</p>
<p>Subsequently, if this person does observe the religion, their experience is framed within the existing paradigm shaped by disappointed authority figures. The person feels hypocritical and uncomfortable, exponentially increasing the negativity associated with religion. Even though the commitment to observance is rejected, the worldview of those who taught the person about the commitment lives on.</p>
<p>This is why it&#8217;s necessary to purge.</p>
<p>Everything one knows about religion and tradition is on the table. Observance is not yet back on the table. First, one has to unlearn the philosophy and worldview that is causing the negative associations.</p>
<p>Broad themes that crop up in almost every situation and must be purged, include: <em>Objectivity of religion, inducement by fear, crumbly proofs and arguments, hypocritical teachers or misplaced priorities, actual abuse, and cover-up of abuse.</em> These are all false idols, yet they are an intimate part of Orthodox Judaism for many people. Religion and Judaism work much better without them. Destroy these idols. Slaughter these gods. Break whatever has to be broken.</p>
<p>One way to do this is to consciously and actively acknowledge the destruction these false idols have wrought. The power of acknowledgment is that it ends the internal conflict raging in one&#8217;s heart. It stops the war between one&#8217;s intuition that says those idols are wrong and one&#8217;s memory that is saying these idols are real. Don&#8217;t fight back against the intuition. It was correct all along.  The purge is over when the person gives their instincts permission to be victorious and Judaism can be approached without any baggage.</p>
<p><strong>Next, the person is ready to explore.</strong> A newcomer to any religion must absorb new ideas and experiences on the fly. The mind may contain very loose associations connected to the experience, but they are so loose that the actual experience determines its own meaning. There are no biases or expectations for the experience. It can be anything.</p>
<p>Exploring means sampling religious experiences on their own terms. Instead of <em>hosting</em> the experience, the person should encounter the experience as a <em>visitor</em>, or a <em>tourist</em>. Take in the shapes, sounds, smells, tastes, feelings, thoughts, and connections like a human exploring a new planet. There are myriad ways to participate in rituals and traditions with an almost infinite number or sensory combinations that can craft the experience. The person should try as many as possible. If one was boring or terrible, sack it. Try it a different way later on.</p>
<p>Every experience is a completely voluntary exploration and personal discovery. Slowly, the person develops a taste for what they love, and eventually will be skilled enough to hybridize new personal flavors for their Judaism. This creates a subjective version of Orthodox Judaism that is deeply personal. It feels more like art than science. Interpretation and meaning should not be institutionalized. Religion is supposed to be art, not science.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, integration is possible.</strong> In order to integrate any new experience into one’s life, it has to be worth it. The benefit of following prescriptions or proscriptions has to outweigh the benefit of not adhering to them. A person will not do things only because of obligation or prohibition. The only reason a person will voluntarily participate in religion is because his/her new perspective on the tradition is personal and makes them feel positive things.  Anyone would be eager to increase positive and meaningful experiences into their life. No one else has to know that the person is participating voluntarily. That’s private. To the observer, there is no difference other than the inevitable joy that accompanies great self-discovery.</p>
<p>Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, a beautiful religious experience can emerge from the darkness. It begins with a death of sorts. Death is followed by a slow rebirth and the process of learning how to fly. It culminates with majestic flight that takes the phoenix soaring to the greatest heights.</p>
<p>I have seen this work in the field. We are able to excise the negative experiences from our hearts. We can discover subjective meaning in religion. We have the ability to incorporate positive experiences into our lives.</p>
<p>I am not saying this must be done. I am not arguing that people are obligated to give this process a shot. I am not confident that it works for everyone.</p>
<p>Far too many people want to enjoy Orthodox Judaism but lack the necessary tools and structure to create a personal Judaism. The principles in this essay are just a starting point to developing this powerful skill. There are additions and subtractions that can be made for each individual person. Everything here can be adjusted and adapted. It can be done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an ever-present tension between modernity and tradition, especially for Orthodox Jews in America. American culture places significance on tradition, yet manages to remain optimistic about new ideas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to be a fundamentalist. It&#8217;s easy to say everything new is wrong, or everything old is antiquated and bad. But I don&#8217;t believe that we should be looking for what&#8217;s easier. We should welcome the challenges of reconciling tradition and modernity. There is great beauty in using the new to improve the old, and the old to guide the new, without relying on extremes. <span id="more-8957"></span></p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s elections reminded me that the American system of government was revolutionary in the 18th century, our Constitution a groundbreaking document that charted a new course for politics around the world.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/11/05/judaism-needs-to-bring-back-the-tension-between-old-and-new-ideas/kinderhand-und-seniorenhand-child-hand-and-seniors-hand/" rel="attachment wp-att-8962"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/190846.jpeg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Kinderhand und Seniorenhand / Child hand and senior&#039;s hand" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8962" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> We revere the Constitution, and every law passed since its adoption must conform to a valid interpretation. That sounds a lot like Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The Torah was revolutionary around 2500 BCE. It remains a groundbreaking document that charted a new course for religion and theology around the world. We revere the Torah, and all of Jewish law must be based on valid interpretations. To an Orthodox Jew, some of the political tension between old and new feels familiar.</p>
<p>Thinking about this tension raises an interesting thought experiment. If we were starting a new country today, would we write the exact same constitution? Would Newmerica be the same country as Oldmerica?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve frozen time in 1789 and only allowed 27 changes in 225 years. I can&#8217;t help but think about how many other things have been completely discarded since 1789. What is the worldview that grants specialness to political theory from 1789? The &#8220;new&#8221; argument asks why we even bother holding onto a 225 year old vision.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can&#8217;t rewrite fundamental laws every day or even every year. One aspect of the argument in favor of traditionalism is how impracticable it would be to discard the old laws regularly, but this only works to a point. How long is long enough? Another &#8220;old&#8221; argument is that the laws seem to be working. Further, it could be argued that the Founding Fathers were especially smart and saw things in a unique way that renders their opinions superior to ours. But both of these arguments are incomplete and don&#8217;t fully respond to the issues raised by the &#8220;new&#8221; argument. Orthodox Judaism shares this tension with the United States.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this kind of tension leads to revolution. A revolution exclaims &#8220;the old is terrible and the new is good,&#8221; but an extreme reaction to extreme traditionalism is unlikely to yield balanced results. Presently, this tension is handled by Constitutional amendments and Supreme Court reinterpretation, which are ad hoc solutions. The real question is whether the Constitution reflects the best possible formulation of laws for our country today. Answering that would require a comparison between the Constitution and a comprehensive new effort; I&#8217;m not aware of any such effort. I imagine that some might even consider this heretical sounding notion a form of treason.</p>
<p>The current system of law in the United States is a masterful attempt to balance the need to change things with the need for continuity. It works pretty well, and the most important element to the success of a balanced approach that reveres the tradition and embraces modernity is an internal system checks and balances. Power cannot be reserved for the traditionalists, and it cannot be seized by revolutionaries. Both must coexist for optimal success.</p>
<p>This is part of our problem in Judaism today. We&#8217;ve all retreated to our own corners. In the past, we&#8217;ve had orthodoxies and reformers in Judaism, but we were operating within one system. Judaism evolved, but not too hastily. We melded our healthy skepticism of change with our yearning for relevance and flexibility. Then, about 150 years ago, the modernists and traditionalists stopped talking to each other and they stopped working within the same ecosystem. Orthodox Judaism and Reform Judaism were born. People who leaned toward tradition chose Orthodoxy, while people who leaned toward modernity chose Reform. The internal conversation ended. Orthodox Judaism lost significant progressive voices and seems like it was frozen in the 19th century. Reform Judaism felt little allegiance to the ways of old, and seems like it has no definitive doctrine and structure. We all lost.</p>
<p>Ironically, the future of modern Judaism requires that the &#8220;new&#8221; and the &#8220;old&#8221; go back to the traditional conversation of the past. In truth, tradition and modernity are symbiotic. We need to hear the best arguments from both sides in order to move ahead with a commitment to truth and Torah as we navigate the challenges of modernity. We need to go back to a large community that lives in the tension between the past and the future. That was our secret for centuries, and now it&#8217;s time to bring it back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I hosted a screening of the Noah Movie followed by a discussion about the film. I loved it. We enjoyed great food, great company, and a great overall experience. But that&#8217;s not enough why I loved the event so much. I loved last night because I think the experience addressed a fundamental struggle to American Orthodox (and non-Orthodox) Judaism.</p>
<p>I view the film as a Modern Day Midrash.<span id="more-8927"></span> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/24/its-time-to-write-the-modern-midrash/vlcsnap-2014-03-13-14h40m55s25/" rel="attachment wp-att-8929"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8929" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vlcsnap-2014-03-13-14h40m55s25.png?fit=600%2C600" alt="vlcsnap-2014-03-13-14h40m55s25" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Bible story is very brief and is missing tons of details. The text also invites many questions about the narrative and morality. Torah scholars and teachers have looked at Bible stories through the lens of their time, place, and personality to answer these questions, fill in gaps, and teach lessons based on the text. These interpretations, whether they appear in the Apocrypha, Talmudic literature, or Midrash compilations, are all a form of Midrash.</p>
<p>For most Orthodox Jews today, old Midrashic interpretations are special. They are given almost the same authority as halachic texts from the same era. They are the &#8220;true&#8221; interpretations of the texts. We have “objective” interpretations of the text and they are cobbled together into a loosely canonized version of Midrash. That’s why so many people assume that all Midrash is historically accurate and scientifically correct. We are led to believe that some Midrash is objectively true. Ironically, the authors of the old Midrash and many of the early Bible commentaries were not working under those assumptions. They acknowledged their subjectivity. Yet, today we teach an objective view of Midrashic interpretation.</p>
<p>This is reinforced by classic commentaries like Rashi because they seem to view the old Midrashic interpretations as the only ones that matter. Or rather, the ones they picked became the only ones that matter. Further, Rashi is our most prolific, more popular, and most studied Biblical commentator and he barely says anything of his own. Just about everything he writes, is found in earlier sources. We are implicitly being told that the only interpretations that matter are older than Rashi.</p>
<p>But if you read other commentaries and later Midrash texts you see that it&#8217;s not so simple. Some Medieval commentators argue with oft-quoted Midrashic interpretations for any number of reasons. We also have more recent Midrash collections that add details and lessons that seem to be new. Interestingly, some of these later Midrashic interpretations are granted legitimacy by contemporary Orthodox authorities, but the reason they are accepted is because they are assumed to be old Midrash that was lost or hidden until the later Midrash publicized it. In other words, the idea that a later Midrash was added by a later interpreter without an earlier source is so troubling that these interpretations are reinterpreted as having originated with the old Midrash.</p>
<p>At some point it became unacceptable or uncomfortable to write new Midrash. But I don’t believe this is the correct approach. I think it is hurting us severely in many ways. Old Midrash is bursting with lessons and ideas about morality and spirituality. Those ideas come from a particular time and place. Of course there is beauty and power to these interpretations and we should study them and teach them. But they are somewhat handicapped by their birthday. The intended audience of the Old Midrash might have included us Moderns, but it’s not a perfect fit. Often, the moral challenges or personal struggles in the old Midrash are foreign to us. It’s like an American reading about daily life in the African Bush. We can somewhat relate to it but it’s not our life.</p>
<p>One of the things I proposed a few weeks ago was that we address the spirit of law in Orthodox Judaism. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">We should be writing new Taamei HaMitzvot that speak to us</a>. Another phase of this effort is an attempt to create Modern Midrash. We should be reading the stories of the Bible and thinking about them in a new and fresh way. What does the story say to me, today, with my challenges, and with my struggles? We would never pass our questions and answers off as objective truth. But truth is not objective when it comes to interpretation. Different people can see different things in the same source material. They both can be true interpretations even if they are not both historically true. There is room for subjectivity in all interpretation of literature, art, music, or really anything that is not science or explicit Divine Revelation. Judaism is art, not science.</p>
<p>Darren Aronofsky, the producer of Noah, has <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/31/movie-review-noah-a-very-jewish-retelling/" target="_blank">written a Modern Midrash</a>. Noah asks many of the same questions as the old Midrash and actually provides many of the same answers &#8211; with a twist. He also asks new questions and offers new answers that are often based on old ideas. It’s literally just like a Midrash. Some of his answers and ideas are odd or uncomfortable and that’s okay. He’s giving us a new way to think about an old story that stays true to ideas about the story that are deeply rooted in our tradition. When one watches Noah within this context, it&#8217;s not just a movie, it becomes a 2 hour and 20 minute Torah class. It invites us to think and criticize and discuss and learn about the Noah story from our modern perspective. And it does so spectacularly.</p>
<p>We need more Modern Midrash. I am certain that the struggles of our generation and the issues we face can be addressed by Torah. But we don’t have to look at Torah exclusively through the glasses of our great great great grandparents. We can look at Torah through our own eyes and see things from our own perspective. Like Aronofsky’s Noah, we make no claims of objectivity or historical truth. But the lessons and ideas can be eternal despite acknowledging their subjectivity.</p>
<p>American Orthodox Judaism faces many great challenges. I think Modern Midrash is part of the solution. It is empowering. It gives us credit for being well educated and steeped in Torah. It allows for creativity and expression. It speaks our language. It makes Biblical stories and their interpretations relevant. It will provide great thinkers an opportunity to see answers to our existential and religious questions in Torah. It will be the voice of our contemporary struggles and triumphs. It changes everything. The process and its results will help create new positive Jewish experiences for a new generation.</p>
<p>So join me in this journey. Let’s write the Modern Midrash together. The next few months of Torah readings are Biblical narratives. The soil is lush and fertile. Let’s build something new out of something old. I believe it is our duty and I believe that we will be successful. If we do succeed, I am confident that we will hear the echoes of the Voice that spoke to our forefathers. That Voice will help us discover our own path to a Jewish life that is full of meaning, religiously commitment, and spiritual ecstasy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach was interviewed by <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/09/ultra-orthodox-jews-have-better-sex.html" target="_blank">New York Magazine</a> about his new book “Kosher Lust.” He drops a bombshell right off the bat:</p>
<p><em>Among us religious Jews, sex is a big deal. It’s a religious obligation. In Jewish law, a man has to make his wife orgasm before he does.</em></p>
<p>The interviewer is skeptical. <em>Really?</em></p>
<p>The Rabbi insists. <em>It’s in the Talmud.</em></p>
<p>This week, Rabbi Shmuley cited the interview <a href="http://shmuley.com/2014/10/20/kosher-and-non-kosher-voyeurism/" target="_blank">in an article</a> that weirdly places the blame for Rabbi Freundel’s voyeurism on his wife. Or something like that. Here’s how he restated his position:</p>
<p><em>The rule applies even more to women. I was amazed last week that an orthodox Jewish sex counselor attacked me for an interview I gave on my new book “Kosher Lust” to New York Magazine, reprinted in Britain’s Daily Mail, that said that Jewish law encourages a man to make his wife climax first. This is Judaism’s tacit acknowledgment of a fact that modern science has finally caught up with – that women are much more sexual than men, having more deeply-rooted sexual needs.</em></p>
<p>This passage presents a softer version of the New York Magazine bombshell. It’s no longer a religious obligation for the man to make his wife orgasm before he does &#8211; now it’s encouragement &#8211; but there is a more fundamental problem with the entire premise. It’s <em>not </em>in the Talmud.<span id="more-8910"></span></p>
<p>Undoubtably, the rabbi is referring to a selection from <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.31a" target="_blank">Tractate Niddah 31A</a>.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/22/rabbi-shmuley-thats-talmud-says/674x501_682670_548164_1346314330/" rel="attachment wp-att-8912"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8912" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/674x501_682670_548164_1346314330.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="674x501_682670_548164_1346314330" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> <em>“R. Isaac citing R. Ammi stated: If the woman emits her semen first she bears a male child; if the man emits his semen first she bears a female child; for it is said, If a woman emits semen and bear a man-child.” (Translation: Soncino)</em></p>
<p>The Soncino translation is confusing to the modern reader because women don&#8217;t emit semen.  In the original Hebrew, “emit semen” is <em>“mazra’at,”</em> which is more literally translated as “she seeds.” What does <em>mazra’at</em> mean in practical terms? And why would it affect the gender of the baby?</p>
<p>We find two general paths of interpretation in the commentaries. One is that when the female climaxes first, the child will be a boy. Thus, <em>mazra’at</em> is indeed orgasm. The other possibility is that women actually do emit a substance during intercourse and if the woman’s emission arrives first, the child will be a boy. In this version, <em>mazra’at</em> follows a more literal translation and refers to a female version of sperm.</p>
<p>It sounds completely unscientific to believe that gender is determined this way. In fact, we can demonstrate that both of the translations are absolutely false, but the Talmud and its commentators got these ideas from the science of their day. The two paths of interpretation may reflect a dispute between the Greek philosophers Aristotle, Hippocrates and Galen, who all held that female orgasm was essential to conception in some way. Aristotle believed that the woman had no seed, but the womb was inhospitable to semen before she climaxed. Hippocrates and Galen believed that friction would “heat” the woman, and a seed would be released inside her body when she climaxed. (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=f2d-11Y_u3cC&amp;lpg=PA270&amp;ots=2p77aBKHko&amp;dq=aristotle%20female%20orgasm&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Either way, the Talmud holds that in order to bear a male child, the female must climax first. The background to all of this is purely medical and obviously obsolete.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, the Talmud does not say what Rabbi Shmuley claims it says. Not even close. Rabbi Shmuley is trying to teach a lesson about sexual pleasure within a marriage based on a Talmudic statement, but <em>nowhere</em> in this statement is there an indication of preference regarding which person climaxes first. Armed with the background information, his attempt seems laughable. The Talmud is not giving sex advice. The Talmud is giving information about <em>sex selection</em>. It simply informs the reader that, scientifically speaking, the order of orgasm determines the gender of the child. That’s all. No obligations. No encouragement. None of that.  Since the information is based on a false premise, it follows that any directive would be obsolete as well.</p>
<p>There is one last twist of irony that undermines the rabbi’s broader point and betrays a troubling bias. Rabbi Shmuley paints the obligation to pleasure one’s wife before oneself as an example of Judaism’s sensitivity towards women. However, the only way one could make that inference from the text is with the assumption that male offspring are better than females. Were males truly more desirable, one could argue that when the Talmud reports how to conceive a male child, it is actually instructing the reader to do so. To me, it seems totally incongruous to make a feminist point from a Talmudic statement that is instructing couples in the fine art of producing male children.</p>
<p>In Rabbi Shmuley’s defense, it’s possible that he borrowed this teaching from a <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/23255501" target="_blank">55 year old article written by Rabbi Emanuel Rackman in Tradition</a>. He mentions this idea, citing the Talmud in Niddah 31A as part of his broader thesis in the article.  His version is softer than Rabbi Shmuley’s version, saying that the Talmud is specifically referring to practices that are <em>not</em> laws. Rather, they are natural consequences of principles that are part of the fabric of Jewish life and tradition.</p>
<p>In summary: Rabbi Shmuley waffles on whether it is an obligation or an encouragement. It’s almost certain that the entire purpose of the talmudic statement is to educate couples in gender selection techniques, and <em>not</em> in the secret to happy marriage. The Talmud is agnostic about whether he or she should climax first. That is, unless you are so patriarchal that you deduce the importance of pleasuring one’s wife first in order to have male children.</p>
<p>It’s wrong to advance one’s agenda by misquoting and misunderstanding sections from the Talmud. Fortunately, we don’t need to rely on mangled proof-texts to make Rabbi Shmuly’s point. In any good relationship, both partners are seeking ways to pleasure their counterparts. Whether it’s through intimacy, general kindness and consideration, support, helping significant others achieve personal success, or raising children together, putting the other ahead of the self is a fundamental of Judaism.</p>
<p>The Talmud (and this is actually true) says that a man has an obligation to make his wife happy (Kiddushin 34b). After all, the Torah commands us <em>“Love your neighbor like yourself.”</em> We are commanded to treat others the way we want to be treated. Seems to me, that’s reason enough to take Rabbi Shmuley’s advice. We don’t need advice that locks us into a specific formula; we use our discretion and follow the love in our hearts. A good husband already knows to put his wife first, as a good wife wishes to put her husband first.</p>
<p>Above all, a good relationship needs honesty and trust. Doling out advice based on an untruth &#8211; even decent advice &#8211; is a terrible way to teach people about relationships.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article first appeared in the Jewish Journal.</em></p>
<p>Three groups of Orthodox Jews have made several prominent appearances in the media over the last few weeks: The East Ramapo Central School District was profiled on National Public Radio because Chasidic Jews living in the district have wrested control of a majority vote on the school board even though their children attend private schools. The New York Times Magazine profiled the cycle of poverty and charity in the non-Chasidic ultra-Orthodox (Yeshivish) enclave of Lakewood, N.J. And the news media is covering a scandal involving Barry Freundel, a Modern Orthodox rabbi in Washington, D.C., who was arrested for voyeurism and the shocking allegations that he was filming women in the equivalent of a locker room as they showered and prepared to dunk in a ritual bath.</p>
<p>These three stories expose the underbelly of the three major groups of Orthodox Jews in America: Chasidic, Modern Orthodox and Yeshivish. Stories are interesting when they contradict conventional wisdom, and it is unexpected that Orthodox Jews, who hold themselves up to a higher standard of behavior and conduct, would find their most sordid secrets splattered across the press.</p>
<p>The public feels betrayed. Innocent bystanders and victims within Orthodox Judaism feel betrayed. Orthodox Judaism just doesn’t feel as trustworthy as it should feel. Recent affairs have whittled that trust away. Trust is the foundation of every relationship, and without it, religion is doomed, whether it is fundamentalist or progressive.</p>
<p>Orthodox Judaism needs to earn back the trust of the public. The media and their audience need to continue to believe that it is interesting when Orthodox Jews behave badly. Orthodox Judaism needs to get its groove back. It’s not impossible to regain trust, but it requires intent and effort.<span id="more-8899"></span></p>
<p>One of the greatest gifts of Judaism is <em>teshuvah —</em> literally translated as “return,” and the Jewish word for repentance.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/21/making-things-better-aftermath-scandal/attachment/108003346/" rel="attachment wp-att-8904"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8904" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/108003346.jpg?w=980" alt="108003346" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Failure is inevitable. We are humans, and humans are flawed creatures who make mistakes. Judaism provides an opportunity to turn our errors into acts of goodness through the process of teshuvah. When we repent, we are actually closer to God than we were before we sinned. It’s as if a ribbon connects us to God. Sin cuts the ribbon into two, disconnecting us from God. True repentance ties the two pieces of ribbon together, reconnecting us. But the process of repairing the ribbon makes the ribbon shorter and reduces the distance between the two ends of the ribbon. Teshuvah reattaches us to God and makes us closer than we were before we sinned.</p>
<p>In any good relationship there will be mistakes that disconnect the two parties. These are opportunities for teshuvah. Whenever a relationship needs to be repaired, if it’s done right, the two parties should be closer after the “return” than they were before the relationship was harmed.</p>
<p>Traditionally, there are three steps to teshuvah: Acknowledgement, regret and reform. These are the three elements necessary to repair any broken relationship or any breach of trust. The Orthodox Jewish community must take these three steps to earn back the trust of Orthodox Jews and the general public.</p>
<p>The first step is acknowledgement. For most people, this is the hardest part of the process. We read about uncomfortable tactics and consequences in the situation in Ramapo. Our natural instinct is to argue that the Orthodox there have every right to run the school board. This is true. But that does not acknowledge any of the mistakes made along the way, or the pain experienced by the rest of the community. Also, without any acknowledgement, the public sees us as tone deaf to the issues raised by the status quo. We need to acknowledge that controlling the board has not been without error, and that criticism may be valid and that people have been hurt and harmed along the way. Only then can we express regret over mistakes and commit to making things better.</p>
<p>It’s true that Lakewood is a paradigm of kindness and charity. But implicit in the immense need for charity to support Torah study is that there is an accountability issue inherent in the <em>kollel</em> system. It is a system that perpetuates poverty and discourages financial independence. We need to acknowledge the problems that the system creates and exacerbates. This is obvious to observers, Orthodox Jews and everyone else. Until we acknowledge it, sympathy is harder to muster. Meanwhile, derision and condemnation by critics is harder to rebut. The first step is to acknowledge the problem. Then the process of fixing the systemic problems can be repaired along with the relationship between the kollel community and everyone else.</p>
<p>The <em>mikveh</em> scandal brings two major issues to the fore. Opportunities for women in positions of leadership and communal policy is a constant itch in the Modern Orthodox community. When men in positions of leadership harm women by breaching their privacy, the itch gets a lot worse. It’s hard to imagine that a woman with the kind of authority granted to Rabbi Freundel would have acted similarly. But this is not the first time a male religious authority figure acted inappropriately toward women in his religious role with regard to matters of intimacy. The scandal also challenges the status quo of conversion in Orthodox Judaism, especially when the convert is a woman. This is the second time a very prominent conversion rabbi has sexually exploited conversion candidates. These issues must be acknowledged by the community in order to begin the process of return. Slowly, trust can be earned back through the teshuvah process.</p>
<p>Generally, the pain inflicted by violence or abuse to an individual or a scandal that violates a group is not as damaging as the pain inflicted by the cover-up. The opposite of acknowledgement is the cover-up. Too often we have been doubly stricken by the pain of the act, and then our suffering is compounded by the cover-up.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the responses to the mikveh scandal by Kesher Israel and the Rabbinical Council of America (RCA) have been heartening. There is indeed acknowledgement of the pain they have allowed to occur under their noses. Kesher acted swiftly in removing the rabbi from his pulpit. The RCA already has charted a new path for conversions that includes women acting as ombudspersons as well as a commission of men and women to reform current policies. These are the second and third steps of teshuvah. Clearly, there is regret as well as a commitment to fixing the problems. This gives a reeling public a glimmer of hope that trust can be earned back.</p>
<p>Fred Rogers famously quoted his mother’s comforting words during times of tragedy: “<em>When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me,  “Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.”</em></p>
<p>Look around. You’ll see good people trying to make things better. You’ll see Orthodox Jews who want to earn the trust of the public once again. There are Orthodox Jews who are helpers. Those people deserve your trust.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the “helpers” can replace the people who are harming individual people as well as Orthodox Judaism in general. They can tie that ribbon and bring us all closer to one another. It’s already happening. I can see it. Trust me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article first appeared on The Lighthouse, my Haaretz.com blog.</em></p>
<p>Kesher Israel, a prominent Modern Orthodox synagogue in Washington D.C., is reeling from a terrible scandal. Their rabbi, Barry Freundel, was arrested on charges of voyeurism and it is alleged that he installed a camera in the equivalent of a women’s locker room where he filmed potential converts in varying degrees of undress before their ritual bath. The shockwaves in the aftermath of this scandal reverberate well beyond the District and are being felt across the entire Jewish world.</p>
<p>Generally, rabbinic “scandals” come in one of two varieties.<span id="more-8900"></span> Some scandals merely involve flawed human behavior that is only considered scandalous because of the stature of the rabbinic figure.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/20/our-hands-have-spilled-this-blood/wallpaperpackmortallity37_13/" rel="attachment wp-att-8905"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8905" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/wallpaperpackmortallity37_13.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="wallpaperpackmortallity37_13" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> If a non-rabbi would commit the same acts, there would be no story. In my opinion, these are not scandals. Human beings behaving in a manner consistent with other human beings are not news. After all, rabbis are people too.</p>
<p>Rabbis are often subject to an artificially constructed angelic standard. This is the flip side of the coin that deifies and attributes clairvoyance or miracles to rabbis. Rabbis are viewed as being capable of the supernatural because they live supernatural lives and therefore are not like the rest of us. They are a more perfect kind of person. Under this standard, the public feigns surprise when rabbis share their struggles or flaws with their followers and critics. After all, rabbis are supposed to be above the petty concerns of the masses.</p>
<p>Such a standard is not fair or realistic and we are setting ourselves up for inevitable disappointment. Rabbis should be held to an achievable human standard.</p>
<p>The other kind of scandal — as appears to be the case in Washington — is when a rabbi commits an act that would be destructive or unethical regardless of one’s clergy status. Or alternatively, when a rabbi exploits his position of authority to manipulate or harm others. These scandals are worthy of our outrage.</p>
<p>We should be outraged whenever one person causes direct harm to another, and it is particularly egregious when one uses their position of authority to do so. That is not merely hurtful — it is the very definition of abuse. When a rabbi or any authority figure abuses others, they forfeit their right to lead. Abuse causes deep spiritual and psychological damage and removing an authority figure who acts abusively prevents them from causing more damage in the future. Without power, the abusive rabbi loses access to victims and the potential harm is averted.</p>
<p>When people undergo massive life changes on the scale of converting to Judaism, they are particularly vulnerable. A person who decides to convert is typically working through a very challenging period of their life. Conversion is a very difficult process made even more challenging by its very nature — everything is new, everything is strange. No one converts twice. It’s a first- and last-time experience for every convert. Most importantly, the convert is at the mercy of her sponsoring rabbi and therefore fears upsetting the rabbi and running the risk of ruining the entire conversion process.</p>
<p>This scandal isn’t the first time we’ve heard of a rabbi exploiting his power in the conversion process. In 2009, it was discovered that <a href="http://blogs.forward.com/sisterhood-blog/121600/good-and-bad-sex-with-the-rabbi/">a rabbi was exploiting potential converts for sexual favors</a>. The outrage towards this rabbi was deserved and he was forced out of his position of authority. But as the details of the events at Kesher Israel emerge, it appears that the Orthodox establishment did not learn its lesson five years ago.</p>
<p>If found guilty, Rabbi Freundel will be held responsible for his misdeeds, but we, the Jewish community, would also bear responsibility for allowing this to happen — again.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of a prospective convert is too easy to do and too hard to uncover once it happens. Will we learn our lesson this time — or will we be complicit in another scandal in which a single rabbi is given too much unbridled power?</p>
<p>Significant oversight of rabbis administering conversions that can prevent such abuse must be standard operating practice in the process. When power is granted and that power has been abused in the past, we have a duty to protect any potential future victims. This is true in any situation, but it is especially true when the potential victims of abuse are bravely volunteering to become part of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>The Torah enjoins us not to oppress the convert and also commands us to love the convert. American Orthodox conversion has now been rocked by two massive scandals of rabbis abusing potential converts in the last few years. Clearly we are not doing enough to prevent oppression and demonstrate our love towards converts. That needs to change immediately.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yom Kippur is a confusing day. One of the most fundamental philosophical principles in contemporary Judaism is the concept of elevating the material into spiritual. We don&#8217;t view physical needs and pleasure as problems that need to be fixed, but as opportunities to sanctify the mundane.</p>
<p>This idea is embedded in the Torah, Talmud, and Rishonim.  Even among the many quarrelsome flavors of Orthodox Judaism that have evolved over the last few centuries, it&#8217;s almost universally held. From Rebbe Nachman to Slabodka, from the Baal Shem Tov to Rav Hirsch, from the Vilna Gaon to the Ohr HaChaim, and from the Sfas Emes to the Ramchal, this theme is ever-present. Today, you&#8217;ll hear it in Mir Yeshiva, Yeshiva University, Beth Medrash Govoha, Brisk, Yeshivat Chevron, 770, Gush, and day schools across the world.</p>
<p>So how is it that on the most important day of the Jewish year, we completely ignore our physical needs and desires? It&#8217;s like a day that recalls a long abandoned ascetic form of Judaism. But why? Our Judaism does not believe in this idea of self inflicted pain. Why would we act this way on Yom Kippur?<span id="more-8885"></span></p>
<p>In my opinion, the beauty found in elevating the secular into the sublime is found in its tension.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/03/making-sense-of-yom-kippur/billing-rate-tug-of-war/" rel="attachment wp-att-8893"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8893" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/billing-rate-tug-of-war.jpg?w=980" alt="billing rate tug of war" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> All art is an expression of some sort of tension. The tug-of-war between our base desire for instant physical gratification and our mature one for transcendent pleasures can sometimes be painful.  When we succeed in this struggle and create harmony between the two, it is undoubtedly exquisite.  For example, a Shabbos meal with its delicacies of food combined with a spirited Torah discussion is plainly beautiful.</p>
<p>The balance of financial pursuits and spiritual pursuits can drive a person mad, but when one serves the other, a precious peacefulness drives a person to greatness. The struggle is difficult, but it also manufactures its own reward.</p>
<p>Even in this beautiful wrestling match, one force is the part you want to be and the other is the part you want to improve. We love the physical side of our existence, but we want to identify as the spiritual side. One is the &#8220;real me&#8221; and the other is the &#8220;artificial me.&#8221; The goal is to be the elevated side and bring the rest of yourself up to that level as opposed to pulling the spiritual side down to your physical level.</p>
<p>Sometimes we forget who we really are. We get distracted by material pursuits or sucked into endless quests for pleasure. Our soulful side is neglected. On any given day, a very spiritual person might ignore their spiritual side for hours at a time. Most people ignore it for days, weeks, months, or even years.</p>
<p>Yom Kippur is the one day of the year when we neglect our physical side and remind ourselves who we <em>really</em> are. Sanctifying our world through the tension of our struggle is a way to make more things spiritual all year long.  However, we learn from the asceticism on Yom Kippur that it&#8217;s vital for the spiritual to retain its potency. We must deeply connect to that part of ourselves in order for everything to work. Yom Kippur is our chance to beef up our spiritual prowess and codify our sacred identities. We proclaim that our physical self is not our true identity.</p>
<p>This is why we begin the day with Kol Nidreh. We disavow our oaths. We detach ourselves from the external obligations we have created. Those are not our true duties, and they are external to our identity. We shed those before we begin Yom Kippur so we may approach the day most purely, with no strings attached. It&#8217;s microcosm of the entire day&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Kol Nidreh loudly reminds us that we are not defined by our self imposed duties, but by our true selves. The Yom Kippur experience helps us define our true selves by banishing the physical and glorifying the spiritual. This is why we step so far out of typical Jewish character on Yom Kippur. It&#8217;s a necessary tactic to maintain the integrity of the whole system built on tension. Without tension, the system collapses, but without a day devoted to the transcendent, we risk losing contact with our souls. So we fast. We don&#8217;t eat or drink. We refrain from all worldly pleasures. All of this is done to remind us who we really are. Then repentance becomes easy. Our sins don&#8217;t represent our true selves. We are really our spirits, not our base needs. When we affirm who we really are<em> to ourselves</em>, it becomes easier to regret our sins and commit to doing better.</p>
<p>Yom Kippur is a long day. Some people revel in its rituals and oddities. For others, it can be grueling and depressing. I think if we are aware of how this strange day might sync with this very important structural element of Orthodox Judaism, it might help a little. It may help us direct our hearts and minds to the important task at hand. If you find yourself struggling during the day, freelance it for a bit. Think about who you really want to be and which side of yourself is winning the tug of war. Think about using this one day to power up your spiritual muscles. Show yourself who you really are and then commit to being that person all year long.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will all merit to enjoy a good Yom Kippur experience and a fruitful, successful, beautiful year of engaging in our struggles.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone asked me a question yesterday that cuts to the core of the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/01/the-shabbos-app-yes-it-is-real/" target="_blank">Shabbos App</a> issue. It was something like this: <em>&#8220;If the Shabbos App was halachically permissible, would you use it?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>My answer is that I would not. I like my Shabbat experience the way it is right now. I don&#8217;t particularly want to add smartphones to my Shabbat experience.</p>
<p>That is the real issue here. The halachic question about whether it is permissible or prohibited and why is a fascinating and important discussion, but it&#8217;s relatively obscure and esoteric. Digging into the nitty-gritty halachic nuances is enjoyable for me, but I think we have to look at the big picture and examine the social and communal issues raised by the Shabbos App.</p>
<p>To me, it&#8217;s real simple.<span id="more-8875"></span> No one would have thought of the Shabbos App or the need for the Shabbos App if people were enjoying the break from technology that Shabbat affords.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/02/shabbos-app-tragic-commentary/iber/" rel="attachment wp-att-8876"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8876" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iber.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="iber" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> If we all loved being off our phones for 25 hours, the Shabbos App would be superfluous. No one would want it. No one would care to have it. But that is not the reality.</p>
<p>Many people struggle with observing Shabbat every week. The phone is a private and quiet way to escape Shabbat observance. That&#8217;s one the many allures of the smartphone. It&#8217;s like holding the universe in your hands, and if someone is feeling stifled by Shabbat observance, the world in one&#8217;s hands can feel quite liberating.</p>
<p>I think most people who have smartphones would be quite happy to be able to use them 24/7. It&#8217;s a bit of a challenge to restrict one&#8217;s smartphone usage for 25 hours if one is accustomed to using their device on a constant basis. It&#8217;s not addiction as much as it is a habit. Smartphones have become like appendages to our bodies. They accompany us to the kitchen for recipes and culinary inspiration. They come with us to the dinner table and can be used to research a point of discussion at the table or to share a YouTube video that gives everyone a good laugh. They are part of our Torah study routine with the entire Torah available at the tap of a finger. Calling us addicts completely mischaracterizes the challenge. Our devices are like auxiliary brains. They are part of everything we do during the week.</p>
<p>So when Shabbat arrives, it is certainly a challenge. Some people embrace this challenge. They say that Shabbat is meaningful because they love being free from technology. It&#8217;s still a challenge, but the personal satisfaction and ecstasy of freedom makes it worth meeting the challenge head on. Others just accept the fact that they might be miserable without their devices and slog through Shabbat like zombies. Then there are the people who don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth giving up their smartphones for Shabbat. The pain of abandoning technology for 25 hours is greater than the payoff of keeping Shabbat. Those people have no incentive to turn off their phones for 25 hours. Why should they?</p>
<p>That is a tragic commentary on our Shabbat experience.</p>
<p>One solution might be to allow for a halachic revolution or a slower halachic evolution to a place and time where using smartphones is halachically acceptable. Another might be to figure out methods of minimizing the desecration of Shabbat to the best of our ability. But I prefer a third option.</p>
<p>The best solution is to craft Shabbat experiences that are meaningful to American Orthodox Jews. This can be done in several ways and should be personalized to each individual person. We need Shabbat programming and meals and prayer services and activities that enhance Shabbat. The existing version of Shabbat works for a lot of people. Friday night services with some singing, family dinner that is almost exactly the same every week and in every home, a family game or a book, sleep, wake up 8:30 AM or later, head to shul, pray and listen to a sermon, grab some nosh at kiddush, eat a big lunch that is almost exactly the same every week and in every home, sing some songs, schmooze, take a nap, go for a walk, play with the kids / siblings / friends, wind down in the evening, mincha, seuda shlishit, maariv, havdala, and pizza for melaveh malka. That sounds heavenly to tons of Orthodox Jews. They wouldn&#8217;t trade it for the world. It&#8217;s better than anything you can get on a smartphone.</p>
<p>But many people don&#8217;t like all the stuff or they might like it but not in the way that it&#8217;s currently configured. We can recalibrate. We can add and subtract within the boundaries of halacha. The experience could be more customized and appeal to each person&#8217;s preferences. In particular, we should focus on the benefits of a digital fast in our modern world so that it becomes something we subjectively want to do. We don&#8217;t need a standardized version of Shabbat. If Shabbat feels like a burden, there are ways to change it up so that it becomes a joy. When we love our Shabbat experience, the smartphone loses its appeal. We are tuned into our Shabbat experience. That&#8217;s better than being tuned out of Shabbat and tuned into our smartphones.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious to me that this is the way forward. It&#8217;s what we discussed in the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/08/a-solution-keeping-the-orthodox-orthodox/" target="_blank">essay</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">series</a> a couple weeks ago. There is a version of Shabbat that is needlessly canonized, and it is to our detriment that it is. We have this idea in our heads that the meaning and lessons of Shabbat or other mitzvot are objective. I&#8217;ve heard a ton of comments that sound like <em>&#8220;but Shabbat is about X</em>&#8221; while the other commenter says <em>&#8220;Shabbat is about Y.&#8221;</em> It&#8217;s about what we make it. It&#8217;s subjective. This is not really a debatable point. So let&#8217;s think creatively. We all know the basic Shabbat rules and rituals that must be included in the experience. So let&#8217;s start from the beginning. To borrow a tech metaphor, let&#8217;s reboot. What would a Shabbat experience look like if we started building it right now? And how many other options and versions can we dream up? Let&#8217;s do it. Let&#8217;s try them. Let&#8217;s create our own subjective Shabbat experiences. Let&#8217;s make them really cool and really interesting. Let&#8217;s make our Shabbat better than anything a smartphone can offer. Let&#8217;s make the Shabbos App completely useless.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Shabbos App was introduced to the world this week. A lot of people think it&#8217;s a hoax. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s very, very real.</p>
<p>Several people asked me what I thought about the app and I wanted to speak with someone at the Shabbos App before I wrote anything. I had a nice conversation with one of the people working on the app and feel comfortable writing about the app, their ambitions, and the consequences.</p>
<p>Almost everyone working on the app is Shomer Shabbos. This is not a subversive attempt to ruin Shabbat or pull people away from Orthodox Judaism. Rather, the app is for Orthodox Jews who want to observe Shabbat <em>and</em> use their smartphones. The developers spent considerable time and effort researching halachic reasoning and opinions on the subject. They know what they are doing and what they are up against.<span id="more-8857"></span></p>
<p><em>I am not an expert on these matters.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/01/the-shabbos-app-yes-it-is-real/halfshabbos1-635x355/" rel="attachment wp-att-8858"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8858" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/halfshabbos1-635x355.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="halfshabbos1-635x355" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> I have studied them several times in various forums, so I am familiar with the general principles and arguments. <strong>Do not rely on anything I say here.</strong></em></p>
<p>Briefly, the issue of electricity on Shabbat is not simple. Every Orthodox Jew knows that it&#8217;s prohibited. Many know about the psak of the Chazon Ish who prohibited electricity based on the <em>melacha</em> (Biblically forbidden creative activity) of <em>boneh</em> (building) because activating an electric device involves completing a circuit which is a form of building. Many people also know that this is not considered an accurate description of electricity or boneh by Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. Rabbi Auerbach famously concluded that although there is no particular forbidden labor that precludes use of electricity per se; it is forbidden because that has become the accepted halachic tradition in Orthodox Judaism. At most, this would be a Rabbinic prohibition.</p>
<p>This rule applies to electricity in general. There are electrical devices that can violate possible Biblical prohibitions. Using a microwave might be bishul, or lighting an incandescent bulb might be <em>mav&#8217;ir</em>. Smartphones raise another set of issues which are particular to modern personal electronics. I don&#8217;t think any of these would be Biblical prohibitions either. The greatest obstacle is probably<em> tikun maneh</em> or <em>makeh b&#8217;patish</em>, but these issues have already been handled with regard to electrical appliances that use a Sabbath (really Yom Tov) Mode. Once again, the Shabbos App team is comfortable navigating these areas of halacha. The problems raised by draining battery, writing, lighting the screen, generating sounds, and charging can be circumvented with technological workarounds. The Shabbos App does all this by running in the background of the smartphone and controlling those problem areas in a way that prevents the issues. Apparently, the Android OS is more flexible in this regard and thus presents a more robust solution. But even in Apple iOS, the app is functional and would potentially avoid all violations of Rabbinic prohibitions.</p>
<p>So it is real. And it actually does what they say it does. At least in terms of the technical aspects of halacha, it seems to avoid violating Shabbat prohibitions according to accepted halachic opinions.</p>
<p>The motivations of the Shabbos App team are genuine and holy. There are people who use smartphones on Shabbat right now. The way they use them is more likely to incur serious halachic problems. As a consequence, those who use them often feel very guilty.  Not to say that they shouldn&#8217;t feel this way, but guilt can morph into a form of religious self-loathing that triggers further departures from observance in other areas. This is a terrible result. The Shabbos App might assuage some of that guilt and keep more people in the fold. They might be right about that too. I am also very sympathetic to the emotional needs of people struggling with observance and I can corroborate the guilt slicked journey off the path. I am not expressing an opinion on the importance of this effort, or whether it outweighs considerations in the other direction. But it&#8217;s a valid concern. Further, if it is permissible to use a smartphone in this manner, then maybe they actually should be used.</p>
<p>So far, the objections to the app carry a familiar tune. In essence, the problem with the Shabbos App is that even if it is halachically acceptable, it will ruin the spirit of Shabbat. I am sympathetic to this point of view as well. There is something beautiful about avoiding technology on Shabbat. Recently I advocated using the digital fast concept as a social benefit to keeping Shabbat on this blog. I think it might be worth turning off our devices for Shabbat even if devices were permissible. However, Rabbi Heinemann addressed this concern when similar objections were raised against his Sabbath Mode ovens. His response was that if something is permissible then it can&#8217;t ruin the spirit of Shabbat. There&#8217;s no such thing. He supported his position by noting that when the Aruch HaShulchan or Rabbi Auerbach permitted the use of telephones on Shabbat the spirit of Shabbat was not a concern. Further, when they backtracked and prohibited the use of phones on Shabbat, they did not hang their hats on the spirit of Shabbat. Telephones were prohibited based on halachic concerns, not spirit of Shabbat concerns. When I asked the Shabbos App developer what Shabbat would look like if everyone would be using their smartphones, his answer reflected this sensibility. He said <em>&#8220;Shabbat will look the way Hashem wants it to look!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>What&#8217;s going to happen when the app is released? Almost all Orthodox rabbis will prohibit it. That&#8217;s almost a near certainty. But what will the people do? Most adults will listen to their rabbis. I suspect that younger demographics might consider the Shabbos App. If they do, they will probably need to hide their smartphone use. I can&#8217;t see Orthodox Judaism adopting the app and its halachic implications en masse in the near future. But it is possible that as we become more and more dependent on technology, especially passive technology, there will be a natural movement toward greater leniency. If that does happen, I think we might look back on the Shabbat App and see it as a catalyst for that change. In the meantime, I don&#8217;t expect any significant change in the way Orthodox Jews think about smartphones, but at the very least we will be forced to talk about these issues with more halachic rigor and discussion. That is definitely a good thing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rosh Hashanah is a funny holiday. It’s not funny because of the humorous High Holidays jokes that rabbis tell. The humor of Rosh Hashanah is to be found in its inherent contradictions.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of Rosh Hashanah is that it is our day of judgment, when every person’s fate is determined by G-d. Who will live? Who will die? Who will prosper? Who will experience failure? The days and weeks preceding Rosh Hashanah are filled with awe and reverence. We seek to make amends to anyone we might have hurt or slighted in the past year. It’s a propitious time for introspection and focus on the task at hand, teshuva &#8211; repentance.<span id="more-8847"></span></p>
<p>When the big day finally arrives, it begins with a short evening service followed by a festive dinner at home.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/23/rosh-hashanah-is-the-sweetest-day-of-judgment/s591346629795598172_p788_i1_w1280/" rel="attachment wp-att-8848"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8848" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/s591346629795598172_p788_i1_w1280.jpeg?fit=600%2C600" alt="s591346629795598172_p788_i1_w1280" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> At the Rosh Hashanah evening meal, it is customary to dip apples into honey. Some people serve sweet challah at the meal and dip it into honey. Symbolic foods (pomegranates, fish, fish heads, carrots, among others) are eaten during the meal. Through it all, there seems to be nary a thought of forgiveness or judgment.</p>
<p>The next day, a few hours are spent in prayer in synagogue. While the Rosh Hashanah prayers are a bit longer than usual, they do not express thoughts of repentance. In fact, the focus seems to be on the shofar blasts &#8212; and more shofar blasts. There are a lot of shofar blasts. But still, no crying or begging for mercy.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a walk is taken to a stream or lake where the tashlich prayer is recited. In this symbolic ritual, we ask that our sins be cast off so that we may enter the new year free of sin. Sin and forgiveness are implied in the prayer, but tashlich can hardly be described as the “grunt work” of perfecting oneself or changing one’s character. Certainly our sins are not cast off just because we say tashlich. It is simply a symbolic ritual that reminds us to repent.</p>
<p>Which leads us to the punchline of Rosh Hashanah. How many ways can we distract ourselves from the essence of what happens on Rosh Hashanah?! Apples, honey, fun symbolic foods, shofar, tashlich&#8230;there a host of rituals that don’t help us repent, but rather take our minds off the primary focus of the day!</p>
<p>Since it is the Day of Judgment, Rosh Hashanah could be a really hard day. People don’t really enjoy hard days. We already have Yom Kippur on the calendar as a designated hard day. If Rosh Hashanah were to be celebrated as two more hard days, it could actually take away from the overall High Holidays experience.</p>
<p>That the sages implemented rituals, traditions, and customs for Rosh Hashanah is actually fortunate. While they seem to skirt around the primary focus of the day, these small acts remind us, in a sweet or interesting way, that Rosh Hashanah is a judgment day. The rituals of Rosh Hashanah are intended to appeal to our sense of taste, our appreciation for music &#8211; even rudimentary music like the shofar blast. Rituals such as tashlich, which include a trip outdoors and powerful symbolic gestures, are all ways of arousing our spirits to repent without banging us over the head with the “REPENT OR DIE” anvil.</p>
<p>These special customs of Rosh Hashanah give this supreme day of religious obligation and spiritual accounting a flair of merriment so that we will be more engaged in the day. It’s the old marketing principle that uses association to lure the customers into endorsing or purchasing a product. If it looks good and feels good, it has a better chance in the marketplace. Part of what makes things feel good and look good are the favorable associations we make in our minds.</p>
<p>Rosh Hashanah is eased along by positive associations. We enjoy good food, the shofar evokes a deep and stirring nostalgia inside our souls, and tashlich takes us outside the synagogue. The distractions are not really distractions as much as they are bunting and balloons decorating a banquet hall. They may take the eye off the event for a moment, but overall they contribute to an atmosphere that is flavorful, fun, and festive.</p>
<p>Don’t look at the Rosh Hashanah traditions as separate from the Day of Judgment. Rather, they are the trappings that enhance the Day of Judgment. Enjoy the sweet food. Drink in the sounds of the shofar. Bask in the sunshine during tashlich. These are the rituals that give our holiday its special taste. Make them important. Make them meaningful. Make them a significant part of your Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p>When Rosh Hashanah is regarded as a special time to which we look forward, when we value the day and when we have good feelings about Rosh Hashanah, we are far more likely to put more of our heart and soul into the Day of Judgment, and that will certainly have a positive effect on our verdict.</p>
<p>May we all merit a happy sweet New Year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, the Israeli Rabbinate granted their coveted Rabbinic ordination to several dozen new rabbis. A cousin of mine was among the celebrants and I was very happy for him upon this great achievement. This cousin is an American born charedi learning in Kollel. He kind of defies stereotypical categories &#8211; yes it runs in the family &#8211; but if you saw him, you would assume he was an idealistic charedi who is living a very simple Israeli lifestyle for the sake of Torah study. And that sort of fits.</p>
<p>When I saw photos of the event, I could not help but notice something remarkable that also defies stereotypes.<span id="more-8837"></span> The people celebrating their ordination that day were from every walk of Orthodox Jewish life.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/23/a-remarkable-rainbow-of-rabbis-2/rb1/" rel="attachment wp-att-8838"><img class="alignright wp-image-8838 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rb1.jpg?resize=600%2C375" alt="rb1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> It was uncanny. If you dream up almost any type of Orthodox Judaism, there was a guy from that version of Orthodox Judaism who received semicha that day. Truly, it was as much a celebration of ordination as it was a celebration of the diversity within Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The beauty of a rainbow is found in its vibrant colors. Each color stands out on its own and also bleeds into the next color so that it is impossible to say where one color starts and another ends. But all those colors are just refractions from the same light. That makes it even more beautiful. This ceremony celebrated one light that refracts into many colors and styles too. The light of God, Torah, and Judaism refracted into vibrant Orthodox Jewish communities. It was a beautiful rainbow.</p>
<p>I can think of no message more important and more powerful as we prepare for the High Holidays. Superficially, there are many ways to do Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. The packaging is different but the content is the same. The body may appear to be different, but at the soul level, it is all one. The packaging is flexible and malleable. The soul is eternal.</p>
<p>We approach the Days of Awe with an awesome responsibility for ourselves, our families, and each other. Everyone has different favorite colors. Color preferences are like opinions, everybody has them. But the colors themselves cannot bicker and fight about which is the true light. They are all just a sliver of true light. None are the light on their own and the light needs all of them.</p>
<p>Same goes for us.</p>
<p>Mazel tov to the varied recipients of Rabbinic ordination. Mazel tov to my cousin. Mazel tov to all of us. Their celebration is our celebration too.</p>
<p>Here is a small selection of the many photos from that day illustrating this point in living color. Photo Credits: <a href="http://www.dat.gov.il/rpic" target="_blank">Ministry of Religious Services</a></p>
<p><em>Enjoy the photos and see it for yourself. (Click for maximum enjoyment.)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A slight detour from the important discussion of the previous few essays. This is like a case study. We&#8217;ll get to the next essay soon.</em></p>
<p>Everyone on the Internet with a Jewish grandmother went apple picking yesterday and took photos for Rosh Hashanah. It was impossible not to notice Somehow this has become a tradition that more and more people are doing every year. I love it. It&#8217;s a lovely addition to the High Holiday season.</p>
<p>We always try to do something creative for our Shana Tova cards.<span id="more-8803"></span> It&#8217;s one of our favorite traditions. Some years we have used apples and honey as props.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/22/picking-new-apples-for-rosh-hashanah/day-10/" rel="attachment wp-att-8804"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8804" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Day-10.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Day 10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> But recently we&#8217;ve been using candy in the photos to wish people a sweet new year. The last couple of years we used giant rainbow lollipops. This year we also thought about going apple picking and getting some action shots for the Shana Tova greeting card. So we started Googling for a local apple picking orchard.</p>
<p>Turns out there is nowhere to pick apples in Los Angeles within a two hour drive of our home. We&#8217;re martyrs for a good Rosh Hashanah photo opportunity and apple picking was a good idea for the photo, but we&#8217;re not actually insane so we did not drive four hours round trip to take a few pictures. We used cotton candy instead.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing. Apples don&#8217;t really work for people in Los Angeles. We don&#8217;t have apple orchards here and it&#8217;s not really the season for apples. September is usually our hottest month and the leaves here don&#8217;t change colors at all. The Fall seasonal elements are foreign to Souther California and like winter imagery, we try our best to superimpose them here.</p>
<p>So for us, apples on Rosh Hashanah is an anachronism at worst and an anatopism as best. None of us would be thinking about apples if not for the preexisting relationship between Rosh Hashanah and apples. We do it anyway. It&#8217;s not a bad thing to create nostalgia around things that don&#8217;t really fit into your current social and physical environment, as Orthodox Jews we do it all the time. It&#8217;s part of what creates our personal Jewish experience. For Ashkenazi Jews, the Jewy foods of Eastern Europe are Jewish. But if not for their Jewishness, I question whether people would dream of eating the majority of those foods. They are anachronisms. But we have a strong attachment to them because of nostalgia. Most of the other symbolic Rosh Hashanah foods are even more anachronistic and they certainly are meaningful to us today.</p>
<p>Yet, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ll say what I&#8217;ve been saying again</a>, albeit in a different context, we should feel empowered to create new Orthodox traditions and experiences that match the social and physical milieu of 21st Century America. If the Talmud was being written today, I don&#8217;t think apples would have the same significance in our Talmud as they did 15o0 years ago. Apples held a prominent place in ancient mythology and symbolism. In our world, the word apple is likely more closely associated with technology than fruit. It&#8217;s just a different world. That is not a reason not to enjoy the time honored symbolism of apples and honey. But it might be a reason to think about what symbolic foods we might find meaningful this time of year if we started with a blank slate.</p>
<p>Lollipops and cotton candy, anyone?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quick recap: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/03/why-do-people-leave-orthodox-judaism-why-do-people-stay/" target="_blank">My theory is that belief in God and Torah m&#8217;Sinai is not the primary factor in one&#8217;s choice to join, abandon, or remain in Orthodox Judaism.</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/08/a-solution-keeping-the-orthodox-orthodox/" target="_blank">The primary factor is how one feels about Orthodox Judaism.</a> There is an infinite number of reasons that one might develop positive or negative associations with Orthodox Judaism that include intellectual, emotional, experiential, and spiritual reasons. Therefore, I suggest that the way forward is to refocus our attention from the overemphasis on beliefs in God and Torah m&#8217;Sinai and shift our emphasis to cultivating positive Jewish experiences. We should be giving people the kinds of experiences that make them want to associate with Orthodox Judaism and these experiences should be cleverly crafted and implemented.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this was a bit of an awkward place to pause. The implementation of the theory was open to very broad interpretation and analogies presented in the case for the theory seem to have influenced the kind of suggestions people who agreed with the theory were making. So let me clarify two things that I was not saying before we get to brass tacks.</p>
<p><strong>I was not saying</strong> that people who leave Orthodox Judaism leave because it&#8217;s easy or fun or based purely on emotion. In fact, I have said many times that it is actually really hard to leave and sometimes people stay simply because it&#8217;s too hard to leave. They are miserably stuck. Further, many people discover knowledge that contradicts their religious education and they accept this knowledge as truth. But that&#8217;s not usually enough to push a person out of Orthodox Judaism. What happens next is the key. When their newly discovered knowledge is met with scorn and derision by authority figures, or bad answers are given for good questions, or the person realizes that they have been lied to, or when the internal conflict between two accepted truths is too difficult to navigate, the <em>feeling that ensues</em> because of the new data is enough to push someone out of Orthodox Judaism. So when I say people leave because they don&#8217;t want to stay, I mean that there are many reasons why someone might not want to stay and very often that feeling is sparked by intellectual discovery. Of course there are people who act purely for intellectual reasons. They are the exceptions. I hope this clears things up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>I was also not saying</strong> that Orthodox Judaism needs to be more fun. I was not saying that Orthodox Judaism is just a social club. I was not saying we need more cholent and every Jewish experience should be like NCSY. I was not saying we should simply do a better job marketing Judaism. I was not saying to avoid discussing belief in God and Torah m&#8217;Sinai. I was not saying experiences are the only thing that matters. I <strong>was</strong> saying that we need to emphasize the importance of a positive Orthodox Jewish experience and in this essay I will be explaining what that means to me. I don&#8217;t think this will make Orthodox Judaism work for everyone. But I think there are a significant number of Orthodox Jews who would benefit greatly from this approach and I think the risk in maintaining the status quo is great.</p>
<p>A basic paradigm shift needs to happen in Orthodox Judaism for any of this to make sense, but I think it&#8217;s an obvious truth that has been ignored for too long.</p>
<p><span id="more-8786"></span></p>
<p>Even those who haven&#8217;t ignored it, don&#8217;t articulate it clearly. <strong>At present, we all tend to treat our version of Orthodox Judaism as an objectively good thing. The truth is that it&#8217;s not objective at all. We relate to Orthodox Judaism in a very subjective way.</strong> By definition, institutions like religion must be as objective as possible. But experiences are subjective and no institution works for everyone all the time. Generally, religions consider themselves objective. This is almost unavoidable. But that does not have to mean that the way we practice that religion should be objective. In fact, we already know this is true because there are so many different flavors of Orthodox Judaism. We might do well to have more flavors, but the presence of multiple paths to an accepted truth is enough to demonstrate this point.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/linie-kolory-grafiki-1800x2880/" rel="attachment wp-att-8788"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8788" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Linie-kolory-grafiki-1800x2880.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Linie-kolory-grafiki-1800x2880" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Simply acknowledging this reality will make for more positive Jewish experiences. Not everyone enjoys the same flavor of Judaism. Personally, I don&#8217;t like cholent and Carlebach kumzitz Judaism. That might be fun for some people but it doesn&#8217;t work for me. Some Orthodox Jews think it&#8217;s great fun to run around in circles and call it dancing. That&#8217;s not for everyone. My point here is that because religious experiences are subjective, we need to acknowledge that not everything that we do will resonate with everyone. Even the &#8220;fun&#8221; stuff. We need to allow for new outlets and modes of religious expression. We can&#8217;t just label everything that wasn&#8217;t done in the shtetl as &#8220;goyish&#8221; and prohibit it. Acknowledging that experiences are subjective will force us to go back to the drawing board and craft experiences that work for Americans. &#8220;Kosher&#8221; Jewish music has barely evolved in the last 30 years. Not everyone likes that kind of music. Not everyone likes &#8220;banging on the table at the Shabbos meal&#8221; music. We should be making American sounding music that is inspirational and reflective of our values. Tastes are subjective and in areas of taste and preference we need to be open to new ideas to give more people positive Jewish experiences.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are social pressures to conform to a certain kind of Shabbat meal. Not everyone wants that food every week. Make the food you want to eat. The idea is that if you enjoy your Shabbat meal, you&#8217;re going to have a better religious experience. If you resent your Shabbat meal, it&#8217;s a bad religious experience. Do the things within the letter of the law that make the experience more enjoyable. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/08/09/in-defense-of-kiddush-clubs/" target="_blank">This is why I am in favor (within reason) of kiddush clubs</a>. To paraphrase the Talmud, make the shul experience more enjoyable with permissible activities.</p>
<p>Some men are uncomfortable wearing dress shoes, black dress slacks, white shirts, and a black fedora all the time. Some women want to dress modestly, but with more variation and colors in their wardrobe. If you are miserable wearing the Orthodox uniform, I suggest a new wardrobe. You actually are allowed to dress differently. It&#8217;s permissible. I promise. So don&#8217;t force yourself to conform and be miserable. Do things the way you like to do them and take pride in your own style.</p>
<p>Different Orthodox communities emphasize different ways of observing Judaism. In some communities, there is an emphasis on spirit and soul. Others emphasize Torah study and intellectualism. Yet others focus on <em>chavivut hamitzvot. </em>The <em>mussar </em>movement, <em>chasidut, </em>Carlebach Judaism, Maimonidean Judaism, <em>Yekke</em> style Judaism, and many more are all valid expressions of Orthodox Judaism. Some prefer to focus on <em>emunah </em>and <i>bitachon, </i>others are inspired by halacha, while others love prayer, yet others love mysticism. But rarely do people born into one group experience the style of the other groups. We have to allow for cross pollination and we can&#8217;t try to force others (or even ourselves) into a predetermined version of Orthodox Judaism. We have to find a place for individuals on a subjective basis.</p>
<p>For many people, the negative associations with Orthodox Judaism are based on the educational experience. Clearly, our schools need to be good environments. Our children spend 8-14 hours a day in school. If they are miserable for that much time every day why would they stay in Orthodox Judaism? Recognizing the religious experiences are subjective means that schools are not going to work for everyone. Schools have to be more flexible about allowing families to choose schools for individual children and not by family. Opportunities for religious expression need to be as varied as possible. Students should be given choices. Most of all, when a student isn&#8217;t happy or isn&#8217;t thriving, we can&#8217;t just invalidate that experience and assign blame to the student or the parents or the school. Not everything works for everyone. Struggling students can&#8217;t be told they are the problem. Their struggles need to be acknowledged. Every school should have the same goal. Students should be happy and love their schools. Everything else is commentary. When children and teens are happy in the place they spend so much time, they are having a positive Jewish experience. I know it&#8217;s possible to create an environment of happy students who love school because I&#8217;ve seen it first hand at Ateres Bais Yaakov, my father&#8217;s school in Monsey for girls K-12. I&#8217;ve heard from more than a few parents of Ateres students that their children are legitimately sad when there is no school. That tells me that school is a positive Jewish experience for their children. But it has to be crafted. It doesn&#8217;t happen without a philosophy and plan for execution.</p>
<p>These examples and suggestions are the sort of small <strong>social</strong> changes that I am suggesting. There are others, but I think you can get the basic idea from the examples I&#8217;ve enumerated. Taking into account the importance of experiences, we should focus our attention to this subjectively and provide as many good experiences as we possible can. But there is one very specific suggestion that I want to discuss. It is much more ambitious and much more fundamental to our <strong>religious</strong> experience.</p>
<p>Orthodox Judaism is a highly legalistic religion. Good acts are deemed to be virtuous based on how well one adheres to the law. Going beyond the letter of the law is good because it helps avoid violations of the law. It makes no difference if one feels the spirit of the law or ritual in Orthodox Judaism. If you get it, great. If not, too bad. Halacha rules. Non-Orthodox Judaism attempts, to varying degrees, downplays the importance of the law and emphasizes the spirit of the law. In this model, the emphasis is on how the religion makes one feel and the law is, at most, a suggestion book. There is little attempt to live by the law where it has no spiritual affect on the person.</p>
<p>My ambitious proposal is that <strong>Orthodox Judaism should consider the spirit of the law</strong>. But I don&#8217;t mean to implement the spirit of the law as it is written in our religious tomes going back 2000 years. The spirit of the law is the area of Orthodox Judaism that is most subjective. <em>Taamei HaMitzvot</em> is the most subjective genre with the most creative freedom within the <strong>religious</strong> teachings of Orthodox Judaism.  For example, the Sefer Hachinuch (13th century) explains the lesson of <em>Shemittah</em> as it related to his milieu<em>. </em>He says that it is just like the Sabbath, as it reminds us not to listen to the heretics who say the world is infinite, rather the religious cycles of seven days and seven years, reinforce our fundamental belief that the world had a starting point with Creation. Six hundred years later, R&#8217; Samson Raphael Hirsch (19th century Germany) had a different approach. In his view, <em>Shemittah </em>served to remind mankind that social classes based on wealth are false. Everyone is equal during <em>Shemittah</em>. No one is rich and no one is poor. We are all the same. <em>Shemittah</em> is about equality. Clearly, these interpretations would not make sense in the reverse time or place. The heretics of 19th century Germany didn&#8217;t emphasize that the world was infinite and the 13 century was pretty much the opposite of the Socialism suggested by R&#8217; Hirsch.</p>
<p>Our current approach to <em>Taamei HaMitzvot</em>, and many others, relies on the assumption that Orthodox Judaism is frozen. In many ways it must be frozen. But not in this area. If we want our Mitzvah observance to have meaning that is relevant to us today, <strong>we need to create a version of <em>Taamei HaMitzvot</em> that works for our time and place</strong>. Start from scratch. Some of the older ideas still work very well today. But we can still work on new interpretations that speak to us in our native social language.</p>
<p>Recently, there&#8217;s been a movement toward a &#8220;Digital Sabbath&#8221; where people refrain from engaging in digital communication for 24 hours. Some people tried to connect this effort to our Shabbat. Others found this offensive because our Shabbat can&#8217;t be about a break from digital devices if we&#8217;ve been doing it for 3500 years! But I think there is an honest way to incorporate this lesson into our Shabbat experience. We don&#8217;t do Shabbat because it&#8217;s our Digital Sabbath, but it is a nice side benefit and it might make Shabbat more meaningful for us. It should definitely be part of the experience. It&#8217;s a lesson that speaks to us today. We need more of that kind of thinking.</p>
<p>We also need to refine our messaging for an audience of 4th and 5th generation Americans. It&#8217;s Elul. To most of my peers, Elul was when we observed European rabbis or their proteges writhing in pain with fear etched on their face in anticipation of Judgment Day. I don&#8217;t think it resonated with anyone. But fortunately, growing up in my childhood home, the emphasis was on <em>ani ldodi vdodi li</em> &#8211; &#8220;I am to my Beloved and my Beloved is to me&#8221; and <em>dirshu Hashem b&#8217;himatzo </em>&#8211; &#8220;seek out God when God&#8217;s presence is most profoundly felt.&#8221; Quite a different message. It&#8217;s different in two important ways. One is that the message I received emphasizes love over fear. But even more crucially, the message might connect with an American teenager. Writhing on the floor in pain because of a feeling that few teens actually experience falls flat. The message of love and presence resonated with me and I suspect it&#8217;s more likely to resonate with other American Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>We built American Orthodox Judaism on the principles of the mythical shtetl. It worked well for some and was disastrous for others. But the shtetl is fading from our rearview mirror. Our connection to that time is tenuous and anachronistic. Now it&#8217;s time to start building our own Orthodox Judaism that resonates with modern Americans. It begins with <em>Taamei HaMitzvos </em>that speak to us today and messaging that works for our sensibilities.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by cultivating positive Jewish experiences. Our rituals and messages need to have meaning and that meaning can&#8217;t just be the stuff that worked in Late Antiquity, the Middle Ages, or the shtetl. It&#8217;s not surprising that those social environments produced specific ideas and emotions that don&#8217;t resonate today. We need to try and compose new poetic teachings and modern day flavor to our Mitzvot that make our observance more meaningful today.</p>
<p>This is the way forward. It is our duty to craft this new version of Orthodox Judaism. We can&#8217;t just rely on our past accomplishments and scholarship to carry us forever. It&#8217;s imperative that we cultivate positive Orthodox Jewish experiences and I think the methodology outlined in this essay provides the framework for the social and intellectual adjustments. Now we just need to do it.</p>
<p><em>Next essay will discuss dealing with bad experiences.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/03/why-do-people-leave-orthodox-judaism-why-do-people-stay/" target="_blank">My theory is that most people who leave Orthodox Judaism, leave because they don’t like Orthodox Judaism.</a> They have negative associations with religion and would feel better outside Orthodox Judaism. There are infinite reasons why someone would develop those negative associations, but generally, if someone likes Orthodox Judaism they will stay and if they don’t like it they will leave. Thus, I propose that beliefs are not the determining factor in observance.</p>
<p>I think that if we believe that this is even somewhat true, we have a viable solution at our fingertips.<span id="more-8778"></span></p>
<p>In the 1990’s, a phenomenon of at-risk teens shook the core of the Orthodox Jewish community. Teens were leaving Orthodox Judaism and we had no idea what to do about it. Articles were written, conferences were convened, many yeshivas and Bais Yaakovs reevaluated their programs, and we made addressing this issue a priority.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/08/a-solution-keeping-the-orthodox-orthodox/light-bulbs/" rel="attachment wp-att-8779"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8779" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Presenta-tu-Idea-large.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Light bulbs" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>At the precise moment that this was happening in the Orthodox communities, the exact opposite phenomenon was occurring outside the Orthodox community. Teens and young adults from non-Orthodox backgrounds were becoming observant in a great wave of young Baalei Teshuva. It seemed obvious that it would be worthwhile to examine the kiruv programs that brought people from the non-Orthodox world into our community.</p>
<p>Many people concluded that the Orthodox community should adopt an <em>“emunah and bitachon” hashkafa</em> curriculum to inculcate our youth with the fundamentals of faith. This included Discovery-like seminars that teach purported proofs for Judaism and Torah m’Sinai. Yeshivas and Bais Yaakovs hosted these programs in their schools. The schools that did not bring these seminars to their institutions, still were more aware that belief should be taught. I think it worked pretty well overall. The at-risk epidemic slowed and we are no longer in crisis mode.</p>
<p>Although fewer youth are defecting, a new crisis has emerged. Adults are either leaving or are unhappy or unfulfilled practicing Orthodox Judaism. That’s where we left off in the previous essay.</p>
<p>I think we adopted the wrong part of the kiruv model. It was a good idea, we just applied it incorrectly. Just as Orthodox Jews do not leave based on their beliefs, people don’t join Orthodox Judaism because of their beliefs. They do need to be able to reconcile their beliefs with Orthodox Judaism, but the thing that hooks them is not our unimpeachable system of beliefs. People join Orthodox Judaism <em>because they like it more than their status quo</em>. They like Shabbat. They like the family structure. They like the discipline. They like the kindness. They like the traditions. People become Orthodox because they like being Orthodox.</p>
<p>It’s not just the <em>baal teshuva</em> movement that demonstrates the superiority of experiences over beliefs. The fastest growing religion in America is Mormonism. The religion with the least attractive beliefs is also Mormonism. There are some extremely odd beliefs and quite a few very offensive beliefs in the Mormon faith. No one seems to care. People are joining by the truckload. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/02/10/some-lessons-orthodox-judaism-can-learn-from-mormons/" target="_blank">The reason they are converting to become Mormons is not because of their beautiful beliefs</a>. It’s quite simply because the Mormon experience is positive. People are middle class, they have designated family nights, there is a structure, people are kind, the community is nice, and they have a great looking package. That’s why people convert. This is despite the beliefs, not because of the beliefs.</p>
<p>So what we should have borrowed from the kiruv programs, and the Mormons, is the emphasis on positive Jewish experiences. <strong>People with positive Jewish experiences will want to be Orthodox.</strong> Kiruv organizations craft incredible Jewish experiences. Trips, Shabbatons, Shabbat meals, learning with charismatic teachers, and tons of personal attention and love are the ingredients for kiruv. They also are the clues we need to craft a solution for our struggles.</p>
<p>Advertising a product is not simply an opportunity to tell the public about your product. Most advertisements want to create a positive association between the consumer and the product. That’s why you’ll see good looking people in ads. The good looking people are there to make your brain excited about the advertisement. Your brain connects the excitement about the ad to the product. Now you think nice things about the product. A product might be perfect and still use this kind of advertising. It’s not an indictment of the product in any way to advertise in this manner. It&#8217;s just smart.</p>
<p>Kiruv is advertising. Time and effort is expended on crafting positive experiences so that the product feels good. That’s not to say the experiences are not genuine. They are genuine, but they are specifically designed to be positive experiences The intellectual parts of the kiruv program appeal to the intellect but the real magic is that they also appeal to the senses. It feels good to have the attention of a great teacher. It feels good to talk about important things. It feels good to have your questions validated. So even the studying part of the kiruv program is a positive experience.</p>
<p>This is what Orthodox Judaism must adopt. Everyone needs to have their light bulb turned on. It&#8217;s different things for different people. But at some point, Judaism needs to turn on the light bulb in our hearts and minds. Positive Jewish experiences are the thing that flicks the switch. We must figure out how to craft positive Jewish experiences for ourselves, for our children, for our communities, and for our institutions. At the same time, we need to eliminate the negative experiences as best we can.</p>
<p>It sounds so simple. It also seems impossible. It’s neither. The challenge is to create positive experiences without making it a sideshow. We have to make our actual Jewish experiences into positive experiences. That doesn’t mean we just give out candy whenever people are not enjoying themselves to distract them. I think the way to do this is by shifting our communal focus from knowledge and beliefs to rituals and experiences. Our creative educational energy should be concentrated on experiences. The Torah is a book of experiences. It tells the story of our experiences that brought us to the Promised Land and it instructs us in a cadre of religious experiences. Make those experiences meaningful. Don’t just rely on tradition or inertia to make those experiences meaningful. It doesn’t happen on its own for everyone. But it can happen for anyone under the right conditions.</p>
<p>Our children spend their entire days in school. We take pride in the academic rigor of our schools. Even the schools that don’t study secular studies or only provide a rudimentary secular education take pride in their more rigorous religious instruction. Everyone cares about academics. After all, we assume that schools are educational institutions. So we put a lot of effort into providing our children with the best education possible. My father is fond of saying that schools are primary social institutions. He’s right. You can have the best instruction in the world. If the students are miserable all day and all night because they dislike school, we are are not providing them with positive Jewish associations and experiences. All they are getting is negative experiences. People who have negative experiences can’t be expected to want the thing associated with that negative experiences. They are not going to want to pass on that negativity to their children.</p>
<p>We should be placing at least as much emphasis on the school social experience as we place on the educational experience. It’s more important than book knowledge and harder to make up for after the fact. Students need to feel safe, loved, appreciated, and respected. They need to have friends and they need to enjoy their time in their primary religious institution.</p>
<p>It’s time to craft better school experiences for our children. Institutions are by definition clumsy. They don’t conform to the needs of every student. But we can try. We can make our schools as subjective as possible. We don’t need to churn out scholars as much as we need to cultivate pride, happiness, and joy in the religious experience.</p>
<p>Adults experience so much of their religious lives in synagogue. Some shuls take pride on inclusivity and fraternity in their communities. But many shuls do not care for such non-religious concerns. Shuls are also social institutions. People need to have good experiences at shul. Rabbis and lay people should be crafting shul environments that give people a reason to come back and a reason to bring their children. We can’t just rely on commitment to halacha. That doesn’t necessarily make for a good experience, especially if no one cares to create a positive experience.</p>
<p>Much of the remaining part of our religious lives takes place in our homes. Shabbos and Yom Tov meals, lighting Chanukah candles, the Seder, Purim, and all the rest of our life cycle rituals are not merely opportunities to observe Halacha. These are also Jewish experiences and we should be crafting positive Jewish experiences every chance we get.</p>
<p>This is the way Torah living is supposed to be. <em>“Its paths are pathways of pleasantness.”</em> It is supposed to be enjoyable. Every ritual, tradition, and Mitzvah can have meaning and value to us. We should be working on sharpening the tools that find new and relevant meaning in our ancient religious practices. Interpretations of our Mitzvot have evolved. The Sefer HaChinuch has a different approach than Rav Hirsch. They lived (probably) around 700 years apart. We can find our own <em>taamei hamitzvot</em> that speak to us. In fact, I think we <em>should </em>be doing that very thing. Religion should bring us joy. It can bring us joy if we do it right.</p>
<p>Many synagogues decorate their prayer halls with flowers in honor of the holiday of Shavuot. The idea behind this custom is that Mount Sinai was adorned with flowers when the Torah was given to the Jewish people so we want to reenact that moment during our celebration of the revelation at Sinai. But flowers weren’t the only thing on Mount Sinai during the revelation. There was fire and thunderous noises as well. But we don’t light bonfires and we don’t make raucous noises to reenact that moment. Torah is meant to be beautiful, like flowers. It’s not meant to be scary or threatening, like fire or thunderous noises. That doesn’t mean it’s going to seem beautiful and pleasant to everyone. But we should work hard to make it feel that way.</p>
<p>The Talmud in Sukkah states that when Rabbi Jonathan the son of Uziel would study Torah his learning was so intense that if a bird would fly above him, the bird would burst into flames. Tosafot provide one message of this teaching. When one learns Torah with the joy that is like the joy we experienced when the Torah was given, the fire of Sinai burns. In other words, Torah was given with <i>simcha</i> &#8211; joy, and that is the way it should be lived. When it is lived that way, amazing things happen.</p>
<p>This is how we ensure the future of Orthodox Judaism. Theology is part of Judaism. But it’s not the thing that makes or breaks Judaism. The most important thing is the experience. If we cultivate positive Jewish experiences and actively remove negative experiences, we are making the choice to stay in Orthodox Judaism much easier. Just because we believe that we are <em>obligated</em> to observe Jewish law, does not mean that we should not <em>want</em> to observe Jewish law.</p>
<p>The next essay in this series will discuss some practical examples and suggestions for crafting positive Jewish experiences on an individual, familial, and institutional basis.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most common question I was asked after <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/05/12/groundbreaking-meeting/" target="_blank">The Summit</a> last spring was if I learned anything particularly insightful into the Orthodox Jewish experience to explain why some people stay in Orthodox Judaism and why others leave. People really want to know the answer to this question. I think they think that if they know why people leave, future defections can be prevented or at least minimized. Or maybe it’s just morbid curiosity. I’m not sure.</p>
<p>I promised everyone who asked me that I would write something up eventually. I think this is it.<span id="more-8771"></span></p>
<p>Most religious people I’ve talked to are pretty sure that their religious convictions are correct.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8773" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/admin605344312.jpg?w=980" alt="admin605344312" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Their religion is the truth. They believe in God and whatever version of God’s word they think it true. They think that the reason they follow God’s word is because they know it to be true. After all, who wouldn&#8217;t act upon the truth? But this is mostly an illusion.</p>
<p><strong>People do not do what they do because they think it’s true or right. People do what they do because it’s what they want to do.</strong></p>
<p>Any number of factors affect what people want to do. Intellectual beliefs might be one of the factors, but it grabs a very small piece of the pie chart that completes the picture of this determination. The biggest reason people want to do certain things is because it feels good. It can be the childish kind of feeling good that comes in an instant and disappears even more quickly. It can be a more mature kind of feeling good that requires delaying gratification and yields a longer, more wholesome period of joy and pleasure. It can even be the kind of good feeling that comes from intellectually believing that what one is doing will eventually bring them joy or pleasure. But the real reason people do things is not because they are able to translate their knowledge of the truth into action. That&#8217;s not something people do. At best, knowledge can translate into feelings which might translate into action.</p>
<p>Think about it. Every cigarette smoker knows that smoking is harmful to one’s health. But that knowledge somehow doesn’t translate into feelings or action. Smoking feels better to a smoker than not smoking so the smoker keeps on smoking. You don&#8217;t need to convince the smoker that smoking is harmful. The smoker knows. But there is a disconnect between knowledge and action. It&#8217;s not an easy gap to bridge. In fact, it&#8217;s rare that the gap between intellect and behavior is bridged. But it can be done temporarily.</p>
<p>Same thing with seat belts. It makes no sense to drive without a seat belt. The car is objectively safer to drive while wearing a seat belt. That is the truth. Yet, every day there are people driving without seat belts. Truth does not automatically create behavior that correlates with truth.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that exercise is healthy. For about a year, I worked out every day. I lifted, I stretched, I ran, I ellipticalled, I enjoyed it a little. But I was doing it because I believed it was best for my wellness. That was enough to give me the feeling that pushed me to continue working out. Intellectual awareness was enough to convince me of the payoff. Knowledge translated into action.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/i-dont-want-to-be-right" target="_blank">An article in the New Yorker</a> discussing the science of how we make up our minds, mentioned a study that is right on point. Researchers proved that no amount of educational information could change the mind of an anti-vaccination parent. There was no difference between parents who received data and persuasive materials demonstrating the importance and absolute safety of vaccines. People don’t change their minds based on data. They do what they want to do. What they want to do is usually based on the things that make them feel good. Not on facts and figures.</p>
<p>However, data and information can temporarily induce someone to try something. That’s why I started working out at the gym. I knew it was good for me so I was willing to give it a shot. But I stopped after a little more than a year. Despite the fact that I was seeing results, I just stopped going.</p>
<p>Why did I stop going to the gym? Because I didn’t like it. I didn&#8217;t enjoy it enough to make it worth the effort. The intellectual justification was only able to keep me going for a little while. Eventually I ran out of intellectual motivation and because the activity was not giving me great joy or making me feel particularly good, and it was taking my time and energy, I dropped it. We can&#8217;t rely on the intellectual knowledge that something is true or good or beneficial to induce a desired behavior.</p>
<p>Judaism is like anything else in the world. The same rules apply. Intellectual knowledge and belief could be very important to God or the Orthodox Jewish community or to each individual Jew. But that does not necessarily mean that beliefs actually dictate what we will do with our lives.</p>
<p>I know more than a few atheists who are happily practicing Orthodox Judaism. The do not believe in God or Torah m&#8217;Sinai, yet they are devoutly Orthoprax. They keep Torah and Mitzvot (except the few inchoate Mitzvot) just like anyone else in their communities. I also know true believers who can’t even be in the presence of Orthodox Judaism. These people really believe in God. In fact, some of these people fear God more than most Orthodox Jews. But they just can&#8217;t do Orthodox Judaism.  They sin despite their faith in God.</p>
<p><strong>The thing that determines whether an adult will practice Orthodox Judaism is not what they believe. It is what they feel.</strong></p>
<p>We like to think we are intellectual beings who make choices based on morality, logic, and rationality. But we really don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s much more banal than that. We do what we like. People who associate their Orthodox Judaism with good feelings, want more of those good feelings. They want to live a life that gives them those good feelings. They will practice Orthodox Judaism no matter what they believe. People who had negative experiences as Orthodox Jews and associate their Orthodox Judaism with pain or trauma never want those feelings again. They want to avoid those feelings. These people will not practice Orthodox Judaism no matter what they believe.</p>
<p>The rule, and every rule has exceptions, is that if you enjoy something, you will do it over and over again. People who enjoy Orthodox Judaism will do it over and over again. People who do not enjoy Orthodox Judaism have a few options. They might simply leave. But not everyone leaves. Some have no idea that there is a way to leave. So they don’t leave and are miserable. Others might expend a lot of energy reminding themselves that they intellectually believe the benefits of staying, whether spiritual or practical, outweigh the benefits of leaving. That might work for a while but if it doesn’t become enjoyable, they probably won’t be able to sustain their observance.</p>
<p>I have talked to a lot of people about their Jewish experience. There might be a few outliers, but almost everyone I’ve talked to fits into these neat boxes. People who leave had a negative experience that define their Judaism. People who stay loved their religious experience. The ones who leave want to avoid future pain and trauma. The ones who stay want to have more good experiences.</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s what I learned at The Summit and the months that followed. It&#8217;s an important follow-up point to the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/29/fixing-the-priorities-that-form-our-social-circles/" target="_blank">discussion about treatment of heresy and heretics in the Orthodox Jewish community</a>. It has been argued that heresy is dangerous because the absence to the proper orthodox beliefs will inevitably cause harmful behavior. Or that heresy is dangerous because if one lacks orthodox beliefs, there&#8217;s no reason to be an Orthodox Jew. I think this is demonstrably false. Generally, people do not choose their path in life based on beliefs. Generally, beliefs do not simply induce behavior that correlates with those beliefs. People do what they want to do, no matter their beliefs.</p>
<p>So what do we do now? Is this information simply a way to scratch an itch? To understand people for the sake of understanding them? Or is this the path to an enlightened approach that could make a big difference to the next generation of Orthodox Jews?</p>
<p>I think there is something we can do. Something we must do. The next post will offer a possible solution based upon these findings that works with the social science and is also deeply rooted in the Rabbinic tradition of Orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rabbi Zev Farber asks <em>&#8220;Can Orthodox Education Survive Biblical Criticism?&#8221;</em> in his latest essay on TheTorah.com. <strong>Not everyone cares about Biblical Criticism, but I think there is something raised by this discussion that is vital to the future of Judaism.</strong> The essay provides a path towards answering his initial query in the affirmative. In short, his view is that we have artificially created a false choice between &#8220;every word is from GD&#8221; and &#8220;heresy.&#8221; If you&#8217;re okay with borderline <em>kefira</em>, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s actually <em>kefira</em>, have a look on <a href="http://thetorah.com/can-orthodox-education-survive-biblical-criticism/" target="_blank">TheTorah.com</a>.</p>
<p>Rabbi Farber&#8217;s approach is a paradigmatic shift in how we look at Torah and God. There is little reason to suspect that Haredi Jews would agree with such a shift. In fact, all the examples and proofs of previous shifts and reinterpretations are summarily rejected by the Haredi world.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a chance that Modern Orthodox Judaism could adapt to Rabbi Farber&#8217;s suggestions. But it would almost certainly create a schism separating Haredi and Modern Orthodox groups.</p>
<p><span id="more-8761"></span> This gap would be different than social and religious gaps that already exist because it would hinge on fundamental beliefs.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/29/fixing-the-priorities-that-form-our-social-circles/shotshop_g54-1x/" rel="attachment wp-att-8762"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8762" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Shotshop_g54-1x.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Shotshop_g54-1x" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Haredi Jews would believe that rejection of fundamental X is heresy and Modern Orthodox Jews would not hold of X. The consequences of this kind of disagreement about theology and belief seem to be more severe than the cultural gap that exists today. It would require much more effort to navigate between the two groups should one group believe the other is heretical.</p>
<p>Accepting Rabbi Farber&#8217;s suggestion might help some Modern Orthodox Jews but if adopted by everyone at Yeshiva University and the rest of Modern Orthodoxy, I think Haredi Jews would consider Modern Orthodoxy the same way they consider Conservative and Reform Judaism. That is, unorthodox and &#8220;part of the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some might argue that it doesn&#8217;t matter. Let the chips fall where they may. There might be some merit to this argument but I think it stinks. Klal Yisrael should endeavor to limit sectarianism and divisiveness. A solution that will divide us further is not an option for me.</p>
<p>But I do have a suggestion that might eliminate this serious concern.</p>
<p>Acceptance of Rabbi Farber&#8217;s suggestion will result in a split of communities, but only under the current social contract within the Orthodox Jewish community at large. At present, beliefs and opinions on matters of God, divinity of Torah, and the like are public information and subject to public scrutiny and ridicule. Everyone knows what everyone believes. Or at least we all think we know what everyone believes.</p>
<p>We place so much stock in what we think others believe, that our social circles have room for people with professed beliefs similar to our own who may be degenerates or criminals. Conversely, our social circles do not have room for people with professed beliefs different from our own who may be upstanding citizens of sterling character. To me, this betrays an extreme overemphasis on beliefs. It seems to me that deeds and character should matter more than personal thoughts and opinions that are of no practical consequence. No one is harmed by erroneous or heretical beliefs. Yet, the non-believer is shunned as if his beliefs were contagious and deadly. But the believer who actually harms others is given free reign to continue harming others.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as if we think that the spiritual consequence of believing the wrong thing is worse than the practical consequence of doing the wrong thing. In my opinion, this is an irresponsible misplacement of priorities. It&#8217;s also somewhat loony. Why should I be more afraid of a friendly and safe Christian than a dangerous Orthodox Jew? Why should we fear the religious Reform Jew more than the Orthodox criminal? Yet this is how we draw the borderlines of our social circles. To me, this is the problem.</p>
<p>I think we need to restructure our social circles based on a redrawing of our priorities. We should give approval to people who do good things and act ethically toward others and participate in religious life and rituals, ahead of giving approval to people of like-minded beliefs. Beliefs are merely but one of many factors that contribute to one&#8217;s moral, ethical, and social behavior. But the behavior is what matters. Orthodox beliefs are inconsequential when they do not yield positive results and unorthodox beliefs are equally inconsequential when they do not have a negative affect on one&#8217;s behavior. Therefore, it seems obvious to me that we are building our social circles incorrectly.</p>
<p>If our social choices placed less value on beliefs, there is nothing to fear if some Orthodox Jews adopt Rabbi Farber&#8217;s worldview. It would be ideal if we could be tolerant of beliefs that are different than our own. But we don&#8217;t even need to got that far. All we need to do is <em>not worry</em> about the beliefs of another. Don&#8217;t wonder. Don&#8217;t ask. Don&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t matter enough <em>to you</em> to justify caring.</p>
<p>Of course beliefs matter to the individual. But that&#8217;s between them and themselves and GD. They need to worry about their beliefs. Not you. You certainly do not need to base any meaningful decisions on beliefs. It would be like deciding who you were friends with based on how much <em>kavannah</em> another person has during prayers. Or more crudely, based on whether they prefer vanilla over chocolate. It&#8217;s not really that important to one&#8217;s social interactions. It might play some role, but it&#8217;s not very high on the list of things that make a difference.</p>
<p>So if one person believes Torah m&#8217;Sinai means one thing and another person believes it means another, it&#8217;s not the biggest deal. It certainly should not be important enough for us to ask that question before all others. Or even after all others. Focus on the person&#8217;s character and the way they behave and they way they treat you. All those things matter far more than theology when it comes to social ties and connections.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Orthodox Jewish community, from Modern Orthodox to Uber-Haredi might consider the value in a reconfiguration of social circles to care more about actions than beliefs. We would be reinforcing to ourselves and our children that our priorities are actions, not thoughts. This would incentivize better behavior and more emphasis on cultivating a culture of good behavior and character.</p>
<p>But the greatest benefit of this kind of social graph would be the opportunity to interface with non-Orthodox Jews and non-Jews. We would be able to learn from one another. We would be able to reunite Klal Yisrael. We would be able to help each other fulfill our roles in this world. We would work together instead of fighting one another. We would be living the way the prophets predicted our Messianic utopia. It&#8217;s within our grasp. We just need a bit of reprogramming. But it can be done. For the sake of our future, I think it must be done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thinks that Hamas and ISIS are the same thing. After ISIS beheaded Jim Foley and Hamas beheaded some &#8220;collaborators,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/503262857425719296" target="_blank">Bibi tweeted a photo</a> that showed both groups performing executions. This replaced a tweet with a photo of Foley just before he was decapitated with a photo of an execution by Hamas in 2012 that also said Hamas is ISIS, ISIS is Hamas. <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/503542317718843393" target="_blank">It&#8217;s become like a mantra for Bibi</a> and many supporters of Israel.</p>
<p>The problem is that it&#8217;s just not true.<span id="more-8749"></span></p>
<p>There are certainly reasons to compare the two groups. But there are too many fundamental differences that separate ISIS from Hamas that the comparison between the two is meaningless.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/26/clearly-hamas-is-not-isis/istock-apple-and-orange/" rel="attachment wp-att-8755"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/iStock-apple-and-orange.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="iStock-apple-and-orange" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8755" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> It&#8217;s comparing apples to oranges.</p>
<p>For starters, ISIS literally wants to kill Hamas. In their eyes, Hamas are worse than Israel. ISIS seeks to eliminate &#8220;hypocrites&#8221; &#8211; Muslims who are not sufficiently fundamentalist &#8211; before moving on to non-Muslims. It&#8217;s hard to say mortal enemies are one and the same.</p>
<p>But there is a much more fundamental difference between Hamas and ISIS. Hamas is a terrorist organization that also serves the needs of many people in Gaza. The people of Gaza are directly affected by the actions of Hamas and Hamas acts on their behalf. But not all the people of Gaza are Hamas and not all the people of Gaza approve of Hamas. In any battle against Hamas, Gaza citizens are harmed. It is inevitable. Homes are destroyed, families are broken, children are killed. The blame for these deaths can be attributed, at least in part, to Hamas. But blame is irrelevant. Hamas is a functioning government for hundreds of thousands of people. Almost all of whom are innocent bystanders.</p>
<p>Further, the people of Hamas are all from Gaza. They are fighting a war against their enemy on their border. In their eyes, Israel stole their land. In their eyes, they are fighting back. It&#8217;s a struggle on behalf of their families and neighbors. It&#8217;s their struggle for their own home and their own future. They are local people from Gaza fighting for Gaza. There are women, children, and families that are connected to Hamas militants.</p>
<p>ISIS is more than a terrorist organization. Al Qaeda is a terrorist organization. ISIS is an offshoot of Al Qaeda that doesn&#8217;t simply want to harm the West. ISIS is the state version of Al Qaeda and their intentions are clear. ISIS is now a country that rules according to their super fundamentalist version of Islamic Law. They took these areas by force and enforce their laws by the sword. The citizens of ISIS don&#8217;t really have a choice about whether they want to support ISIS, but more importantly, the IS fighters are not representative of the citizens of these areas. They imposed themselves on the new citizens of ISIS.</p>
<p>IS fighters come from all over the world. The hoodlum who beheaded Jim Foley is apparently from Britain. An American fighting for ISIS was killed today. The spiritual leader of ISIS came from Belgium. The fighters of ISIS are a ragtag group of degenerates who are fighting for glory and adventure. They have no families. Many brought their sons with them to ISIS so that they could be indoctrinated and trained to be fighters as well. But the war and the cause are the only thing that matters. There are no women and small children. In the entire <a href="http://vice.com/video/the-islamic-state-part-1" target="_blank">Vice News ISIS</a> documentary there was literally only one, very brief, shot of a woman in a burqa standing in the background of the frame. IS fighters are not fighting for their families. They are not fighting back against an aggressor. They are a club of men who are wreaking havoc on the region, and they are having a good ol&#8217; time doing it.</p>
<p>So when Bibi says that &#8220;Hamas is ISIS&#8221; and ignores the crucial difference between the two, he is attempting to justify the collateral damage in Gaza by equating the two in a way that is completely unfair. Hamas might behead collaborators with their enemies. Hamas might indiscriminately fire rockets at civilians. These are terrible things to do. No question. But when returning fire on Hamas, there is collateral damage to people under the rule of Hamas. The battlefield is in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The war against ISIS happens on the battlefield. ISIS is trying to capture cities and remove borders. Fighting ISIS in those places won&#8217;t lead to collateral damage at all. There are no families in the trenches with ISIS. But there are families in the trenches in Gaza.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Hamas claims to be interested in making an agreement with Israel. Sometimes they say they will fight Israel to the death, and other times they make agreements with Israel. They are far less ideological in their diplomacy. ISIS won&#8217;t compromise with anyone. They will kill anyone who does not submit to their rule. Hamas kills collaborators, not everyone that is not Hamas. Hamas does not desire to rule the entire earth. They just want Israel. Saying Hamas is ISIS actually betrays a deep misunderstanding of what the IS is all about.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry if this sounds like small difference. But small differences can have really massive consequences. The greatest of these consequences was today&#8217;s news.</p>
<p>A truce was signed today. Hamas agreed to a truce. Is ISIS signing any truces? Clearly, Hamas is not ISIS.</p>
<p><strong>In light of today&#8217;s news, I urge the Israeli Prime Minister to tweet a photo of Hamas shaking on the truce with a caption that says &#8220;Hamas is not ISIS.&#8221;</strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Dear PM <a href="https://twitter.com/netanyahu">@netanyahu</a>, Now that we have a cease fire&#8230; Clearly, Hamas is Not ISIS <a href="http://t.co/GaJlpKTRkc">http://t.co/GaJlpKTRkc</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last six years, I have met a lot of very interesting people who have come to visit the Shul on the Beach. People from dozens of countries, backgrounds, and disciplines have joined us for services at Pacific Jewish Center. One of the joys of my pulpit is meeting many fascinating people.</p>
<p>This week trumped them all.</p>
<p>A nearly blind elderly man, escorted by a 20something young man ambled his way through the entrance to the shul. As per usual, he was greeted warmly by shul members. The elderly man declined a siddur explaining that he couldn’t see anyway.<span id="more-8745"></span></p>
<p>I happened to be near the entrance of the shul at that moment. I make rounds through the shul several times during the service.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/25/one-of-those-moments/sur-harvey-william_052314_539_332_c1/" rel="attachment wp-att-8746"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8746" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/sur-harvey-william_052314_539_332_c1.jpg?w=980" alt="sur-harvey-william_052314_539_332_c1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> This was during the blessing for the sick after the 5th Aliya, so I overhead the man say <em>“Is the rabbi here, Rabbi Eliyahu Fink?”</em> The man who greeting him responded in the affirmative and then noticing me, told the man <em>“and here he is!”</em></p>
<p>I shook the man’s hand, and the man grasped my hand tightly with both of his warm, comforting hands. Looks me in the eye, despite his inability to see me, and says <em>“I came to see you. We are family.”</em></p>
<p>Never seeing this man before and never hearing of any family in Los Angeles, I was a little confused. He must have sensed my hesitation because he said<em> “I’ll tell you later.”</em> Turns out, “later” was immediately because he couldn’t resist telling me the whole story.</p>
<p>My father’s father’s mother’s mother was named Malka. She had a brother named Ahron Yaakov. The man standing in front of me in the back of my shul was Ahron Yaakov’s son. Woah. I was talking to my great-grandmother’s first cousin. My first cousin, three times removed. The nice young man escorting him was his grandson. My father’s third cousin. My third cousin, once removed. Woah.</p>
<p>The pair took seats near the front and sat quietly for the rest of the service.</p>
<p>Before I began my sermon, I welcomed all our guest, as I always do.  I added a special welcome to Mr. William Harvey (Hershkowitz), my great-grandmother’s first cousin. It was emotional for me just to say the words out loud. To converse with a piece of my history and reconnect with family for the first time.</p>
<p>After services, Harvey was the life of the party at kiddush. Everyone wanted to talk to him and he gave the people what they wanted. Turns out, he is Holocaust survivor who lectures on the Holocaust and other important topics at the Museum of Tolerance. William’s mother was living in the United States in the 1880s but returned to Czechoslovakia in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>The Holocaust hit the Hershowitz family when William was 19 years old. Clearly he survived. William story of survival is remarkable and he was showing off a print out of an article chronicling his story published in the Jewish Journal a few months ago. (<a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/survivor/article/survivor_william_harvey" target="_blank">Jewish Journal</a>)</p>
<p>At kiddush, I asked William if we would stick around so we could talk. He said, I waited years to meet you, I can wait a few more minutes. After the crowd had thinned, we finally had some time to catch up on family connections and history. William had maintained a relationship with my great-grandmother, my grandfather (her son) and my grandmother (his wife). He was thrilled to meet me and my sons on this day.</p>
<p>We pledged to meet for coffee and grow our relationship and friendship. I look forward to the opportunity. William is a kind, warm, sweet man. Time spent in his presence is time well spent.</p>
<p>As we parted ways on Shabbos afternoon, William began to cry. I don’t know why he was crying. I started to cry too. I don’t know why I was crying either. But we held each other, our shaking bodies and tear stained cheeks embracing for the first time, feeling like it was the thousandth time.</p>
<p>It was one of those moments. The entire episode had been building to this outpouring of emotion and I will never forget what that felt like.</p>
<p>You meet a lot of great people at The Shul on the Beach. You have a lot of special moments working at The Shul on the Beach. This one topped them all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve encountered two very public suicides in the last couple of weeks.  The death of Robin Williams resonated with millions of people around the world. This week, the <a href="http://t.co/qrPxLLnE2l" target="_blank">death of IDF Lone Soldier Dave Gordon</a> is being considered a suicide.</p>
<p>Understandably, suicide is a very difficult subject. Tensions and emotions tend to run high. You should see some of the emails and messages I’ve received in the wake of my article about Dave. One of the fundamental suicide issues is whether the act of taking one’s life willingly is actually a moral choice made by the deceased or is suicide just the end of a long struggle with one’s mental health and would be more accurately described as succumbing to suicide than guilty of suicide. Another important question for Jews, like friends and family of Dave Gordon, is how Jewish law handles suicide.<span id="more-8733"></span></p>
<p>Suicide is not mentioned in the Talmud explicitly. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/22/impressive-insight-on-suicide-from-the-aruch-hashulchan/heiliger-sand-en-worms-rheinland-pfalz_60b8d35c626f819f09b4cb3d90083826_1000_free/" rel="attachment wp-att-8734"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8734" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/heiliger-sand-en-worms-rheinland-pfalz_60b8d35c626f819f09b4cb3d90083826_1000_free.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="heiliger-sand-en-worms-rheinland-pfalz_60b8d35c626f819f09b4cb3d90083826_1000_free" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Mishnah and its interpretation in the Babylonian Talmud are the black letter law and commentary of Jewish law. If a law is not mentioned in the Mishnah or the Talmud, many authorities consider the law to be a level below Talmudic law.</p>
<p>It is significant that suicide is not explicitly discussed in the Mishnah or Talmud because everyone “knows” that suicide is a grave sin and will bar one’s burial in the Jewish cemetery.</p>
<p>The source of these laws is actually the Beraita in Smachot Chapter 2. The <a href="http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/ערוך_השולחן_יורה_דעה_שמה#.D7.A1.D7.99.D7.9E.D7.9F_.D7.A9.D7.9E.D7.94_.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.90" target="_blank">Aruch HaShulchan</a> summarizes and expands on these laws in Yoreh Deah 345. “We don’t engage with one who intentionally commits suicide” is how the law is stated in Smachot. The Aruch HaShulchan says that Chazal rule that suicide is a grave sin and the deceased loses their share in the World to Come. There is a Tannaitic dispute about whether one may curse one who committed suicide. Rabbi Akiva says we do not bless nor do we curse, presumably because we can’t know the intentions of a person who killed their self. Perhaps they were coerced or afraid of something dire. Therefore we don’t make any assumptions.</p>
<p>Many people assume that we do not shiva for people who take their own lives. This is a dispute among two Medieval Torah giants. Maimonides and Nahmanides disagree about sitting shiva for one committed suicide. Nahmanides permits and Maimonides famously prohibits.</p>
<p>Smachot defines intentional suicide. It’s not one who falls from the top of a tree or rooftop. Rather, suicide requires that the person explicitly state “I am going to the top of this tree or rooftop and then I will jump off and kill myself.” If he follows through, we may assume it was a suicide. But if the deceased was simply found strangled or fallen upon a sword, we do not assume it was a suicide for legal purposes.</p>
<p>The Aruch HaShulchan restates the law. “We learn from here that it is not “intentional suicide” unless the person stated their intent to commit suicide with a particular form of killing and we also saw the person immediately follow through on their word. Anything that does not meet this two part test is not considered suicide by Jewish law because it is possible the person went insane.</p>
<p>In a new subsection, the Aruch HaShulchan expounds further. Basically, if there is any way to explain the death of a possible suicide victim, we use the alternate explanation. Either extreme fear (perhaps paranoia), severe pain, insanity, or maybe the person thinks it’s a mitzvah to avoid all possible sin via suicide, or any other similar explanation because “it truly is a very farfetched thing that a person should take their own life with a clear mind.” He then cites King Saul who “fell on this sword” in our version of <em>Hara-Kiri</em>, lest he be taken by the Philistines. That’s considered “<em>ohness</em>” &#8211; involuntary act &#8211; and all the more so with regard to a child.</p>
<p>The Aruch HaShulchan was completed before the 20th century. I am impressed with Rabbi Epstein’s apparent understanding of some of the mysterious psychology regarding suicide. Nor does he shy away from the subject and pretend that no one ever commits suicide. But in a legal sense, he makes it very clear that with extremely rare exception, no one commits halachic suicide. Therefore none of the benefits accorded to the dead in Jewish law are forfeited, even in a case of what is clearly a suicide. This shows great compassion and empathy.</p>
<p>But perhaps even more impressive is the assumption that suicide is tied to mental illness. In his mind, healthy people don’t commit suicide and people who commit suicide had to have been unhealthy.</p>
<p>Finally, he doesn’t seem concerned that this will open the door for more suicides. He views suicide as something that healthy people would never do, even if it’s discussed. Even more profoundly, he seems to be arguing that from the perspective of Jewish law, suicide is not a moral choice for which one is liable. It’s a moment of insanity that is usually the result of deep depression or other dark feelings that overcome one’s willpower.</p>
<p><em>In the debate about whether suicide is a &#8220;choice,&#8221; it&#8217;s pretty clear that the Aruch HaShulchan held that it is almost never a moral choice.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to talk about suicide. But we need to have the discussion so that we can better understand our brothers and sisters struggling with thoughts of self harm. The Aruch HaShulchan took a fairly progressive position on suicide. HE was not afraid to talk about it or the causes of suicide. That was 125 years. It&#8217;s time to catch up to our past. It&#8217;s time to speak candidly and frankly about these difficult issues. We cannot afford to wait any longer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For a few hours on Tuesday, the Jewish world’s attention was focused on a missing IDF soldier. David Menachem Gordon was reported as missing and Jews around the world were fearful that he had been abducted by terrorists.</p>
<p>David’s body was found. David was dead. He was not abducted by terrorists in Gaza. He was not killed by Hamas terrorists.</p>
<p>But Dave, as he was known to his friends, had been “missing” for years. He had been abducted by a different kind of terrorist in his childhood years. Terrorists in Michigan. Jewish terrorists. These terrorists took Dave’s childhood innocence from him. These terrorists took Dave’s life from him, and after all these years, the pain became too much for Dave to endure.</p>
<p>Dave is a victim of sex abuse in the Orthodox Jewish community. Dave was a victim of abuse and a victim of silence about abuse.<span id="more-8717"></span> He wrote about his ordeals in a stirring, soul baring article on the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-m-gordon/secrets-dont-get-better-with-age-why-im-choosing-leadership-over-secrecy_b_3424110.html" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a> last summer.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/19/dave-gordon-of-blessed-memory/10402584_10202558041536926_5155966355278708257_n/" rel="attachment wp-att-8719"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8719" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10402584_10202558041536926_5155966355278708257_n.jpg?w=980" alt="10402584_10202558041536926_5155966355278708257_n" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Dave agonized over the decision to tell his story. He went back and forth with friends about whether he should publish the article. Like most victims of any sort of abuse, he was afraid of the stigma that surrounds so many survivors of abuse. Eventually he came to realize that “secrets don’t get better with age” and Dave decided to share his story and his pain, hopeful of inspiring others.</p>
<p>In his own words:</p>
<p><em>“The steps leading up to the boy&#8217;s second floor bedroom seem to go on for eternity. He just wants to be alone. He just wants to sleep. As long as he doesn&#8217;t have to consciously face the brutal reality. He wishes he had the courage to stop them, to say no. He is trapped. Unable to disclose his mortifying secret, the boy can only fantasize revenge on those vile men whose twisted lustful current raged through their veins. He couldn&#8217;t escape their eager clutch or their intimidating remarks. The boy was told to be silent. He was always told to be silent. They told him it was immodest to speak up or draw attention to oneself. But what did they know about modesty?</em></p>
<p><em>The boy sits silently in seclusion, sweating as waves of fury and nausea wash over him. He feels paralyzed as the repulsive images of his molestation, rape and sexual manipulation replay over and over in his young mind bringing along fresh doses of shame and horror. He dreams of an escape from his Hell. Bright and creative, the boy naturally finds ways to achieve his goal. But the numbing effects of his chemically induced bliss are only short lived. The poison could never quite fully break the shackles of his trauma. As much as he tried, he could not ignore the scattered scars that sexual abuse left on his Soul.</em></p>
<p><em>Everybody who cares only hurts him more. When they ask him what is wrong it forces him to confront what he so eagerly tries to suppress. Not wanting to be further harmed, the boy isolates. He just wants the horrors to end and secretly wishes to be forgotten forever.</em></p>
<p><em>But the boy is not forgotten. The boy survives. The boy thrives.</em></p>
<p><em>The boy is ME. This is my story.</em></p>
<p><em>I kept my secret for eight years. For eight years I suffered in silence through the horrors of my own personal Hell. I endured close to a decade of rage, tears and ultimately self-destruction. The memories are nauseating, the shame unparalleled.”</em></p>
<p>Living as a victim of sex abuse with few allies and even fewer friends, is a slow way to die. It may eventually take one’s life. It might take one’s life in the spiritual sense, or the religious sense. It might take one’s life by killing any sparks of happiness that have managed to hide under a rock in the survivor’s soul. It might kill the survivors personality and ambition. Sometimes, as it seems in the case of David M. Gordon, sex abuse eventually snuffs out one’s life completely.</p>
<p>We don’t know for certain how Dave’s life ended or why it ended. But friends of Dave’s are pretty sure that he took his own life. Indeed, Dave seemingly predicted his own suicide in his article on the Huffington Post. <em>&#8220;He just wants the horrors to end and secretly wishes to be forgotten forever.”</em></p>
<p>Dave is not the only survivor of sex abuse who has struggled with suicide. It’s a regular part of the pain of an abuse victim. I’ve heard it from more than one person. The feeling that one’s life is worthless or that the secrets are just too much burden to bear, are completely normal for sex abuse victims. When just living life takes so much effort, and that life can feel compromised in so many ways, it can seem like the fight to live is not a battle worth fighting. Dave was far from the only one to feel this way.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, it’s not usually the actual abuse that hurts so much. On more than one occasion, Dave confided in friends, that he often felt more hurt by the willful ignorance of those who were supposed to protect him, than by his abusers. Abuse happens in a finite space and time. It starts. It ends. It hurts. But the pain of being ignored and misunderstood is infinite. It doesn’t end. The pain of hiding and protecting people who hurt their victim. That doesn’t end. That’s what kills people.</p>
<p>Dave joined the IDF to fight a war. We all thought he was fighting a war against the enemies of Israel. But Dave was fighting a much more intense war in his own head. Aharon (Shloimie) Bennet, a friend who grew up with Dave and later reconnected with him through an online group for survivors of abuse, said <em>&#8220;I feel like he died fighting the wrong war.”</em> Another friend and former roommate, Chaim Levin, who is also an activist, told me <em>&#8220;Dave Gordon was a fighter until the end. He died while the State of Israel is at war, but he died fighting his own personal war.”</em></p>
<p>When a soldier is killed in combat, his comrades are inspired to ensure that the death of their fellow soldier was not in vain. Dave was a fighter. He left everything he had on the battlefield. It all ended for Dave while the Jewish people prayed that we find him. It’s almost poetic that the image of Dave that was being shared was a picture of Dave wearing his uniform. There is an image of Dave’s lifeless body being pulled out of a hole where he presumably died. Dave literally went into a hole to die. More poetry for a life of shame and secrets.</p>
<p>Life is a struggle for everyone. One person’s struggle is not the same as another’s. For victims of sex abuse, the struggles are immense. Many successfully engage in their inner battles. They live beautiful, productive lives. The fight their pain every single day. Many others try valiantly, but eventually succomb to the inner demons injected into their souls by violent aggressors.</p>
<p>We can’t control everything. We can’t control every abuser. We can’t control every survivor’s feelings. But we can control how we react to abuse in our communities.</p>
<p>We prayed that we would find David Menachem Gordon alive and unharmed. There was no chance that we would find him unharmed. But there is a chance that we can reduce the harm for others.</p>
<p>We can create safe places for victims to report abuse. We can cooperate with authorities when abuse is suspected. We can hear the stories of victims and let them know that we feel their pain. <a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/29519/2009/03/27/new-york-historic-charedi-newspaper-publishes-for-first-time-editorial-by-rabbi-about-abuse-in-the-frum-community/" target="_blank">Rabbi Pinchus Lipschutz said it best in 2009</a>. <em>&#8220;We realize it wasn’t your fault. We realize you didn’t do anything wrong. We realize that you were singled out for punishment due to no fault of your own. We realize you were taken advantage of. We love you. We care about you. We are here for you. We will listen and we will hear. You are not alone.”</em></p>
<p>That was five years ago. Things are better today than they were in 2009. But we can still do better. Do it for the hundreds of zombie victims who are too shell shocked to speak up. Do it for your friends and family who are victims of abuse. Do it for Jewish children everywhere. Do it for your children. Do it for Dave.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you are a survivor of abuse and are struggling with thoughts of self-harm, please reach out to someone for help. I promise you that you are more loved than you could possibly imagine and there are people who will drop their entire lives to help you get through your periods of darkness. (Call 1-800-273-8255)</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Thank you to Chaim Levin for helping with this post.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I heard about <a href="http://www.seedsofpeace.org" target="_blank">Seeds of Peace</a> a few months ago. Dan Adler was at our home for Shabbat lunch and he asked me if I would be interested in going to visit the camp for a couple of days in the summer. Thrilled at the prospect, I said that whatever, whenever, I would figure out a way to be there.</p>
<p>For weeks, I had been looking forward to observing Seeds of Peace in action and I had high expectations for the experience. I spent a few hours on Monday and Tuesday this week at Seeds of Peace and my expectations were greatly exceeded.<span id="more-8709"></span></p>
<p>Seeds of Peace is an international program that brings teens from the Middle East together for a summer camp experience.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/14/my-small-piece-of-seeds-of-peace/img_8967/" rel="attachment wp-att-8712"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8712" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_8967.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="IMG_8967" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Admission to the program is highly competitive and all the campers are high achievers. Campers self-identify as Israeli (Jewish and Arab), Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian, Afghani, Pakistani, and Indian. Back home, many of these teens live in war zones and many are technically at war with each other. A sprinkling of American teens dot the camp roster. The Americans come to learn about conflict and conflict resolution first hand. Every one of the American campers that I met was impressive. These teens are the cream of the crop.</p>
<p>Ideally, the camp seeks to groom a generation of leaders who will be comfortable articulating the position of their opponents, maintain friendships across enemy lines, and are able to engage in meaningful and respectful dialogue with peers from the other side. For many of the campers, this tantalizing goal is met. But at worst, all the campers learn to be positive influences on their peers, cooperation and discussion skills, a great summer experience, and friends for life from around the world.</p>
<p>The very first Seeds of Peace group sat on the lawn of the White House as President Clinton acknowledged their presence as the most important people in attendance at the signing of the historic (and unfulfilled) Oslo Accords. President Clinton was correct. They were the most important people on the White House lawn that day. Friends with mutual understanding and respect, learned at Seeds of Peace, could be the Rabin and Arafat of their generation. That’s the dream.</p>
<p>The reality is that the dream is alive. It could happen. The program is incredible and I can definitely see how campers with the skills and experiences acquired at Seeds of Peace could grow up to be part of the solution. Campers go through intense dialogue sessions where they are encouraged to voice their feelings, as harsh as they may sound, and others are given the opportunity to respond. These meetings are moderated by highly trained professionals and according to the campers, the results are extremely eye-opening. But Seeds of Peace is not kumbaya and peace pipes. The wounds are ripped open, the pain is excruciating, and there are moments of passionate disagreement. That&#8217;s okay. Peace is not the absence of disagreement or pain. Seeds of Peace is real.</p>
<p>The campus is dotted with art and poetry. It’s all inspirational and it’s all made by the campers. These friendly reminders create a beautiful backdrop for the important work happening all over the campus.</p>

<p>Seeds of Peace is blessed with a superb staff from top to bottom. Every person I met who worked for Seeds of Peace impressed me. They are all confident, kind, smart, compassionate, and strong. They were all really good people.</p>
<p>My first Seeds of Peace experience was in the music room. Campers are divided in three kinds of groups. Sleeping bunks, dialogue groups, and dining groups. This way they get to interact with a variety of campers regularly. A lot of wisdom goes into these groups and the staff works hard to maximize the experience for all campers. In the music room, the group was using ukeleles and drums to work together and make some simple music. I met campers who said they were from Israel, Palestine, India, Afghanistan, America, and England before the session began and that wasn’t even the whole group. As a casual observer, I was impressed with the efforts of the staff in fostering a positive experience for everyone and using the music room as a place to develop much broader skills. The campers learned a few chords on the ukelele, but they also learned cooperation, respecting the choices and tastes of others, leadership techniques, and communication skills.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/14/my-small-piece-of-seeds-of-peace/img_8976/" rel="attachment wp-att-8711"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-8711" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_8976.jpg?resize=391%2C391" alt="IMG_8976" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>One of the purposes of our visit was to bring John-Michael Parker from the band Great Caesar to the camp so he could perform a bit for the campers. At a lineup before dinner, John-Michael say a gorgeous rendition of Hallelujah. With a little help from Jakob Adler (Dan’s 12 year old son), the campers joined the chorus. They all sang it again and again. It was so powerful to hear all these teens singing a very meaningful song together. It was one of the first things I saw at Seeds of Peace, and I was in tears already.</p>
<p><iframe src="//instagram.com/p/rkssWFNR3e/embed/" width="612" height="710" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>After dinner I played kickball with a group mostly made up of campers from Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan. I hit it off with a kid from Kabul. He was great in the field and scored a couple of runs. Kickball with a kid from Kabul. It was surreal. This kid grew up in Kabul. He lived through the intense fighting that we all heard about on the news and here he was in Seeds of Peace. Having a ball.</p>
<p>After evening activities, all the campers gathered in a great hall for short talk from the surviving wife of the founder and a video about the founder of Seed of Peace, John Wallach. The video broke me down even further. I told Ms. Wallach that it would have been worth the trip across the county just to see that video with that audience. It was powerful.</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/27556278?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="615" height="461" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>After the video, John-Michael performed his hit song “Don’t Ask Me Why“ with a little help from his friends Eli and Jakob (mostly Jakob). The campers loved it and I was moved by their spontaneous swaying and clapping. Our night at Seeds of Peace ended with after the performance but it was far from over for the campers. They would engage in a community building activity to create and foster new friendships and relationships.</p>
<p>My mind was racing as we drove back to our hotel. There was so much more to experience at Seeds of Peace. I had a taste and now I wanted more.</p>
<p>We returned to Seeds of Peace the next day for another dose of Seeds of Peace. This time, we joined campers at lunch. I was seated at a table with 6 campers and a few staff members. I finally had the opportunity to actually talk with the campers about camp and their lives back at home.<br />
<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/14/my-small-piece-of-seeds-of-peace/img_9018a/" rel="attachment wp-att-8710"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8710" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_9018a.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="IMG_9018a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Some campers come to Seeds of Peace because they’ve seen how much it changed their friends. Before the summer of 2013, there was a teen from Mumbai who was not very friendly and a bit of a bully. He went on Seeds of Peace and came back a sensitive and kind young man. One of his friends noticed the chance and he decided to apply for Seeds of Peace. If it could change his friend, it could certainly help him too.</p>
<p>One camper simply said he wanted to learn about people on the other side of their conflict. An Afghani camper told me how mad he was at a Pakistani camper in his group on a day that Pakistani fighters crossed into Afghanistan and killed two people over the border. He voiced his feelings in dialogue group and directed them at his Pakistani peer. They worked through it. It was tough. But it worked. It’s not magic or anything. It’s real work by the campers that does it.</p>
<p>Others told me that they came to Seeds of Peace to change the world. They want to begin with their families and their communities and hopefully move on to the entire world. These are the optimistic, ambitious campers. One Israeli teen was waxing poetic about the role of Jewish people in the world and how he came to make world peace. Sounds too easy. Especially at Seeds of Peace, where difficult conversations are moderated and guided.</p>
<p>But it’s not easy. Many of the campers don’t have peacemaking intentions. Some of the campers come just to tell their side of the story. One Palestinian girl was so hopeless about the prospects for peace in her world that she just wanted to tell the Israeli campers how she feels. She’s even trying to resist the natural friendships that are formed through the experience. Her greatest fear is making an Israeli friend and then seeing her friend at a checkpoint in her IDF uniform. It would be too much for her to handle so she is protecting herself by not making friends. I learned a lot about the Palestinian experience from her, more than I am at liberty. I think everyone who loves Israel should talk to people from the West Bank or Gaza and just listen.</p>
<p>My favorite quip of the discussion was when a 15 year old from Pakistan told me that he is going to teach his parents and grandparents not to hate Indians and Afghanis. When I challenged him by asking why they should listen to a 15 year old kid, he was emphatic that he believes that &#8220;age does not matter.&#8221; He was undeterred. So I taught him about the <em>ad hominem</em> fallacy because he’s going to need to pull that card out of his pocket at some point. He was appreciative.</p>
<p>Another thing I learned from talking to the campers is that not all of them actually know about the conflicts in their countries. They know that there is a conflict and they may even know the major players in the conflict. But these are just teenagers. They don’t know all the history and even what they do know lacks a sophisticated understanding of the issues. Seeds of Peace helps them develop the vocabulary and terminology to discuss the problems in their countries. More importantly, it provides a framework for understanding the conflicts through the eyes of their opponents. But above all, it gives campers the opportunity to learn the history and current state of their conflicts.</p>
<p>Talking to the campers was a special treat. I learned a lot. Hopefully the campers thought I had something to offer them as well. I felt very comfortable talking to the campers and I credit them for being so warm and welcoming. I only wish I had more time with them.</p>
<p>As I walked towards the parking lot with Dan, Eli, and Jakob, I felt a sweet sorrow. I didn’t want to leave. I wanted to stay at Seeds of Peace. The camp puts everything I believe about conflict and peace into action. It is planting seeds of peace, not harvesting peace. The seeds may take a long time to germinate and sprout. Not all the seeds will be successes. But something has been planted. It was planted in me just being there for a couple of days. It gets planted in hundreds of teens from around the world year after year. Those seeds are bearing fruit. One man’s dream is coming true.</p>
<p>I have dreams of returning to Seeds of Peace. It would be an honor to spend time at Seeds of Peace next summer, or every summer. Hopefully, I’ll make my way back there. In the meantime, I know there is something incredible happening under the watchful eye of some amazing people at Seeds of Peace. Keep on planting. Peace is coming. There is peace on a small idyllic campus in Maine. The rest of us will get there soon.</p>
<p>Thank you Dan Adler for showing me this beautiful place. Thank you John Wallach for making this beautiful place. Thank you to the staff of Seeds of Peace for a beautiful experience. Thank you Seeds of Peace for being this beautiful place.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s time we had a conversation about mental health. Two weeks ago, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/07/29/in-memory-of-yisroel-polstein/" target="_blank">I lost a dear friend to a toxic combination of severe mental illness and crushing addiction</a>, two very dangerous conditions that compound their severity exponentially. Yesterday the world lost a genius who battled severe depression and addiction until he ended it all with an apparent suicide. Losing Robin Williams was tragic and a bitter pill to swallow. But seeing some  of the reaction in the Orthodox Jewish community to his death coupled with the reaction to the death of Yissy, many of my fears that we are lagging behind in our communal approach to mental health were confirmed.</p>
<p>I am not a mental health expert. But I know that I am not a mental health expert. That&#8217;s why I consult with experts and do my own research to try to understand things beyond my expertise. I spend a lot of rabbinic counseling time working with people who are struggling or even succeeding in their personal battles. Many of these battles are related to mental health. Many others struggle with addiction. (That will be the topic of an upcoming article.) I&#8217;ve learned a lot and I am going to learn a lot more. Most importantly, I&#8217;ve learned that the stereotypes and assumptions in our community need to be addressed.<span id="more-8698"></span></p>
<p>First, the stigma. We dance around mental health because of the stigma we attach to anyone suffering from mental illness.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/12/lets-talk-about-depression-and-mental-health/xdepresyon-tms3-jpg-pagespeed-ic-elwmfqhwtz/" rel="attachment wp-att-8699"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/xdepresyon-tms3.jpg.pagespeed.ic_.ElWmfQhwTZ.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="xdepresyon-tms3.jpg.pagespeed.ic.ElWmfQhwTZ" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8699" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Our communal currency is reputation and our currency pays for marriage prospects, prestige, and influence. Mental health affects one&#8217;s reputation and severely devalues the person who is suffering as well as their family. The price is steep and the incentive to hide or ignore warning signs is great. It&#8217;s a sad irony because dealing with mental health issues as they crop up is much more effective than trying to treat a condition that went undiagnosed for an extended period of time. Further, mental illness does not go away by itself. So we are actually setting ourselves up for greater failure by not dealing with mental illness in its early stages.</p>
<p>More importantly, mental illness can appear out of nowhere at any time. Debilitating diseases or cancer can afflict perfectly healthy people even after decades of perfect health. We don&#8217;t know what life can bring. Someone struggling with their mental health and succeeding is a worthy, if not admirable, potential life partner. Every individual case is different. Stigma makes them all the same. The stigma needs to go away.</p>
<p>Most remarkably, sometimes the absence of stigma can make it easier for those with mental illness to manage their struggles. The stigma makes it harder and the lack of stigma makes it easier.</p>
<p>Second, just because a mental health issue is identified and treated does not mean it will be cured. In fact, mental illness is never cured. It&#8217;s just managed. But we need to be aware that just because we do all the right things and make all the right decisions, mental illness may persevere over our efforts. Not everything can be fixed. Sometimes we do everything right and it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the stigma attached to mental health issues is warranted. Again, every issue is different and every person is different. Stigma makes everyone bad. Not every mental health issue can&#8217;t be managed and the ones that are managed are undeserving of any stigma. Even the the ones that are managed less effectively don&#8217;t deserve stigma. They deserve our attention and sympathy. Stigma makes it easy to relegate them to the trash heap of society.</p>
<p>Third. When we say that mental health issues can be managed, we really mean that the struggle is constant but with proper care the struggles can be overcome. That being said, it takes a lot of will power to overcome those struggles and they do not get easier. Sometimes mental illness can fade in and fade out as well. But the struggle is eternal. Even while dormant, there is a constant threat that the symptoms will return.</p>
<p>It takes tremendous strength to wage war with yourself. Fighting mental illness can feel like destroying your own self. The condition is so much a part of the person that the struggle can seem like a civil war with no winners, only losers.</p>
<p>In particular, depression is very difficult for some people to understand. It can seem like run of the mill melancholy to outsiders. Or wrought by specific circumstances to others. But depression is an illness. It does not allow its victims to simply choose happiness or to just snap out of it. Depression is real. It may or may not be the result of any number of external factors, but no matter the cause, it is a severe malady. Against the victim&#8217;s will, life comes to a screeching halt. It&#8217;s not because the person is sad. The sadness is the symptom of the illness. You can&#8217;t tell a person suffering from clinical depression to &#8220;cheer up&#8221; any more than you can tell a cancer patient to &#8220;heal thyself.&#8221; That&#8217;s not how it works.</p>
<p>We are more comfortable saying that schizophrenia is a real illness. &#8220;That&#8217;s a real mental disorder&#8221; we say. &#8220;Depression was invented by gentile doctors. Torah can make a person happy! Depression is just indicative of a lack of proper <em>simcha shel mitzvah</em>.&#8221; Or something like that. This is dangerously primitive thinking.</p>
<p>Depressed people will contemplate suicide. Often. There are experts who can help. If you know someone who even jokes about suicide, try to get them help. Don&#8217;t do it on your own. Unless you&#8217;re a psychiatrist, it&#8217;s above your pay grade. Suicide is not an option for people who do not struggle with mental illness. It is an option for people suffering from depression. It&#8217;s shocking and scary to learn a loved one is struggling with suicidal thoughts. But it happens. It&#8217;s serious. </p>
<p>The brain is a body part. Happiness is experienced by a healthy, functioning brain. Happiness is not actually in your heart or your soul. It&#8217;s in your brain. If a brain is not functioning properly, it&#8217;s broken, like any other body part. We can see when an arm is broken. We can&#8217;t see germs so until recently we didn&#8217;t acknowledge their existence. But if you look under a microscope you can see germs. Case closed. Depression seems to be unobservable. But depression actually is observable. Brain scans of people suffering from depression are noticeably different in the areas associated with happiness and joy. It&#8217;s there. It&#8217;s real.</p>
<p>Depression can look like a regular case of being sad to an outsider. The outsider might even think that depression and feeling sad are the same thing. This can lead to terrible mistakes in dealing with depression. You can be cheered up if you are sad. Most people who are feeling sad would welcome it. But for someone suffering from depression, the brain does not respond the same way as it does for someone without depression. The outsider might think that the depressed person simply lacks the initiative, or will power, or interest in feeling better. They may think that happiness is a choice. For most people, happiness is a choice. For people with depression, happiness is not a choice. It&#8217;s beyond their reach. It&#8217;s like asking a 7 year old child to dunk a basketball on a 10 foot rim with no help. Not going to happen. Not the child&#8217;s fault. We wouldn&#8217;t ask a child with severe autism to give a public speech. Don&#8217;t ask people with depression to just grin and bear it. That&#8217;s causing more harm than good.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s try to look at depression and other mental health issues through the lens of modern medicine. For people actually struggling with their mental health, let&#8217;s get them the help they need. But always mindful, that we cannot stigmatize those who seek help. Let&#8217;s remember that people who struggle with mental illness, will likely always struggle with mental illness. It&#8217;s a daily battle. No one beats mental illness and just forgets about it. Mental health requires constant vigilance for many people. It&#8217;s a journey that spans a lifetime. Be helpful. Be sensitive. Be aware that your brain probably doesn&#8217;t work the same way their brain works. Ask how you can help. </p>
<p>In this light, it makes little sense to draw lessons from Robin Williams&#8217; suicide unless it&#8217;s a lesson about mental illness. And even then, for those of us fortunate enough not to struggle with mental health, there&#8217;s not much we can learn either. We can appreciate just how great a struggle it can be for many people, regardless of the circumstances of their lives, just to survive the internal war in their own minds. We can learn that talent and humor and genius and money are not real factors when it comes to clinical depression. Indeed, this is an important lesson, but it is limited to our understanding of others. It&#8217;s likely only barely relevant to most of us. But we are far from this level of understanding.</p>
<p>I did a Google search for Jewish articles on depression. One at Ohr.edu spent two paragraphs on clinical depression and twelve paragraphs on normal people who are sad. Aish.com features an article extolling the virtues of self healing one&#8217;s depression by choosing to be happy. I am grateful that it worked for the author, but this is hardy a sane option. Then there is an article by Rabbi Dr. Abraham Twersky from 2010 that covers some of the same points outlined in this article. It&#8217;s a great article. But it&#8217;s very short, and over 4 years old. Other than that article, I think Google betrays our lack of sophistication in this area.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t fix depression and other mental illness. But we can educate our communities on these issues. Next time there&#8217;s a talk on the subject, attend, take notes, ask questions. Bring what you learned back home. Talk about it at your Shabbos table. Let&#8217;s start the conversation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve met a lot of Young Jewish Professionals in Los Angeles. A few months ago I attended a four session, 25 hour seminar that grappled with the issues facing the broader Jewish community and Jewish millennials. There are many issues.</p>
<p>One of the issues is Jewish engagement. Without parents dragging them to Jewish events and without children compelling them to participate, many Jewish millennials experience a severe dip in their Jewish involvement after high school that continues until parenthood. As the the gap between Jewish experiences increases, the odds of future engagement decrease as well.</p>
<p>A major obstacle to Jewish engagement is money. Events and programs cost money. Millennials are famously struggling financially. With only one income and the high cost of living in major cities across the USA, Judaism becomes a luxury that too many millennials simply cannot afford. As a nation, we cannot afford to lose them.<span id="more-8688"></span></p>
<p>A very high percentage of Jews would like to attend High Holiday services. With good reason too. The religious experience, coupled with the social experience and nostalgia make a good case for participation. But in cities like Los Angeles, High Holidays seats are very expensive. There are free or almost free services available. But most of these are kiruv oriented services. The service is provided for free, but there is an implication that the leaders of the service are trying to win people to their version of Judaism. That&#8217;s okay, but not everyone is comfortable in a kiruv environment. Many people want to attend a service that feels familiar and is attended by other people from similar backgrounds who practice a similar version of Judaism.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/10/help-send-jewish-millennials-high-holiday-services/img_8921/" rel="attachment wp-att-8692"><img class="alignright  wp-image-8692" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_8921.jpg?resize=389%2C291" alt="IMG_8921" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>My professional mission is to provide positive Jewish experiences to the maximum number of people possible. I want to help these Young Jewish Professionals. They are from my generation. These are my people. We grew up in the same world. I&#8217;m a millennial rabbi.</p>
<p>My idea is to send Young Jewish Professionals who cannot afford High Holidays tickets to the High Holidays service <em>they want to attend</em>. <strong>The money raised by this campaign will be used to buy High Holidays seats for Jewish Millennials at the synagogue or temple of their choosing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So for my Young Jewish Professionals, here is what I say:</strong> I want everyone to be comfortable this High Holiday seasons. Go where you feel comfortable and I will pay for your seats. If you have no preference, you are invited to The Shul on the Beach where we have a diverse group of people and we do everything we can to make everyone comfortable. Share this campaign so people in your social circle who can help fund this campaign will help us out. If you would like to be a beneficiary of this campaign, please email me a <a href="mailto:rabbifink@gmail.com" target="_blank">rabbifink@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>For everyone else, here is my pitch:</strong> Please buy one extra seat this High Holiday season. But don&#8217;t give the money directly to your synagogue. Make a donation to this campaign and I will make sure it goes to good use. If your seats cost $100, please donate $100. If your seats cost $500, please consider donating $500. You&#8217;ll be helping create positive Jewish experiences for people who need them badly.</p>
<p>As a bonus, your donation will earn you a prize. The more you give, the more you get. Plus, giving charity is the best way to prepare for the High Holiday season.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peace has descended upon southern Israel. The war is over. Finally. Hopefully. No more rockets flying overhead. No more air strikes on Hamas targets. No more artillery battles in urban Gaza neighborhoods. Hopefully, the underground tunnel terror network is impotent by now.</p>
<p>We can all breathe a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The worst time for the public to analyze the cost and benefit of a war is during a war. Emotions are high. Armchair analysts have almost no way of influencing war policy and the analysis is undoubtedly missing key data and driven purely by ideology. But now that it’s over, I think it’s time to ask <em>the</em> question. There is only one question to ask now.</p>
<p><em>Was it worth it?</em></p>
<p><span id="more-8676"></span></p>
<p>The only way to answer this question is to establish the status before the war, then establish the status after the war, and then establish the cost of getting from the former to the latter.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/07/was-the-war-in-gaza-worthwhile/israel-palestinian-gaza-conflict/" rel="attachment wp-att-8678"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8678" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/532217197.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN-GAZA-CONFLICT" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Two months ago, there was relative quiet in the region. A kidnapping and murder in June changed everything. Israel responded, Hamas escalated, and suddenly we were at war. Hundreds of people were killed. Lives have been changed forever. War comes at a great cost. For people like me, who want to avoid that cost unless absolutely necessary, the war became a great internal moral struggle.</p>
<p>All I could think about, was <em>how many Israeli lives were lost in the war? How many innocent Palestinians were lost? </em><em>Are those numbers higher or lower than the number of lives that would have been lost if there had been no war?</em></p>
<p>To me, that is the only thing matters.</p>
<p>It bothered me enough to do some research. From 2005-2007, four Israeli citizens were killed by Hamas terror attacks. During Operation Cast Lead in 2008, Hamas rockets killed three Israeli citizens. In 2011, Hamas militants murdered six Israeli civilians and another was killed following Israel’s immediate response. The subsequent Operation Returning Echo saw zero Israeli civilian casualties. Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012 saw the death of four more Israeli citizens. Three yeshiva students were kidnapped and murdered in June 2014 and three more Israelis were killed during the war.</p>
<p>In all, Hamas or their affiliates have killed 23 innocent Israeli civilians in the last decade. This is an unacceptable number. The only acceptable number is zero.</p>
<p>Israel championed the terror victims admirably. Vowing to neuter Hamas, the IDF has operated in Gaza several times over the last decade. During these incursions, dozens of Israeli soldiers have died. Several thousand Palestinians, innocent and guilty, have been killed.</p>
<p>We return to our initial question. Have we reduced the total number of deaths with these efforts? Or have we increased the total number of deaths? Or is it too uncertain?</p>
<p>Again, I ask this question, because it’s the only question that matters. War is a last resort for Israel and it can only justify war if the fighting will reduce death. Israel calls its army a Defense Force for a reason.</p>
<p>Prior to the discovery of the tunnel terror network, I privately feared that the war was actually causing more death than it was sparing. The status quo didn’t seem so terrible. But the war was taking the lives of far too many soldiers and Palestinian civilians. Their blood is just as red as the rest of us. I didn’t think it was fair for soldiers and innocents in Gaza to die unless their death was part of a cause that was saving the lives of others. Every time a soldier was pronounced dead, I flinched in pain. Every time I heard of the civilian casualties in Gaza, I shuddered.  It didn’t make sense to me.</p>
<p>Then we found the tunnels. The tunnels justify everything. A well-organized terror operation would have killed thousands of innocent Israelis. It’s impossible to think that the extensive tunnel network was simply an elaborate underground system for smuggling goods into Gaza. It was almost certainly part of a plan to kill Israelis. Finding and destroying those tunnels cost us many lives. But it seems very likely that it saved far more lives.</p>
<p>War is terrible. I am extremely uncomfortable with war. The only way for me to reconcile war in my mind is to see the benefits of war outweighing the cost. For much of this conflict I wasn’t sure if the benefits outweighed the cost. Now I am sure.</p>
<p>Rest easy, my fellow doves. The war is over. And it was worth it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This is an expanded version of a section from <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/cover_story/article/the_meaning_of_tisha_bav_in_trying_times_together_we_remember" target="_blank">my cover story in the Jewish Journal</a>.</em></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges of Tisha b&#8217;Av is finding the strength to feel pain that has had thousands of years to heal. For many people, the day ruefully memorializes our fallen temples, but unfortunately, the loss of our temple is no reason to be sad for many of our brethren. Perhaps this explains the dearth of non-Orthodox Tisha b&#8217;Av services. Why mourn for a temple if its absence is not considered a tragedy? Even for devout Jews, who intellectually appreciate the devastation we should feel over the destruction of our temple, turning these thoughts into feelings can be extremely difficult. Knowing why a prescribed emotion is appropriate is a far cry from experiencing the sentiment on demand. <em>“The furthest distance I’ve ever known, is the distance from my head to my heart.”</em></p>
<p>Perhaps it’s wise to aim our attention towards something that more directly touches our hearts. Tisha b&#8217;Av and the destruction of the temples in Jerusalem are not merely about architectural losses or even the loss of sacrifices and temple rituals of splendor. Indeed those are certainly lamentable, but they are so foreign to us that it can feel like trying to feel a mathematic equation. We know that the arithmetic works, but we don’t have any feelings about the numbers. Indeed, there is something far more calamitous, far more personal, far more tender, that occurred when the Second Temple was razed to the ground nearly 2,000 years ago.<span id="more-8663"></span></p>
<p>Our Talmudic Sages teach that the Second Temple was destroyed due to sinat chinam — baseless hatred — between fellow Jews.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/04/human-tragedy-tisha-bav/jerusalem_siege_by_romans_70_ad_1/" rel="attachment wp-att-8665"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8665" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Jerusalem_Siege_by_Romans_70_AD_1.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Jerusalem_Siege_by_Romans_70_AD_1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Typically, this is taken to mean that the Jews of that time, much like Jews of seemingly every time, did not need an excuse for enmity towards each other. There’s nothing fancy about it. They simply hated each other and perpetuated an anti-social environment. Instead of gratuitous kindness and friendship, they exhibited gratuitous divisiveness and acrimony towards each other. For this, the Temple was destroyed. We did not deserve a Temple if we couldn’t even be friends. In a practical sense, how could we expect to work together in the Temple if we hated each other? Even in a halachic sense, how could a priest achieve atonement for another person if he didn’t even care if that other person was forgiven. Caring for one another is a prerequisite to the service in the Temple. To be sure, this is a valuable and important lesson: &#8220;A house divided against itself cannot stand” socially and religiously.</p>
<p>This is an acceptable interpretation and one that has been a cornerstone of the moral lessons of Tisha b’Av for 2000 years. But if we dig a little deeper, it seems the rabbis may have been alluding to a bit of historical context as well. The simple version of the Roman conquest of Jerusalem in 70 C.E. is a story of superior Roman forces overwhelming a puny Jewish army. Our defeat was inevitable. But the siege and subsequent fall of Jerusalem to the Roman legions were far more dramatic and much more tragic. It’s a tale of deceit, betrayal, fratricide, and ego.</p>
<p>The Roman victory was actually unintentionally aided by Jewish rebel factions, whose internal strife paved the way for the enemy’s triumph. For decades, militias of Jewish rebels fought back the Romans with minor victories on the battlefield. There were even some moral victories when we lost, such as the suicide pact at the Battle of Masada. No unified leader emerged and the various rebel groups jockeyed for power, authority, popularity, support, and recruits.</p>
<p>The last stand of the Jews during the Great Revolt took place in Jerusalem. At the time, according to the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, three groups of Jewish zealots occupied the Temple Mount, outer courtyard, and inner courtyard of the temple for strategic purposes. Three groups with a common enemy, but without any unity.</p>
<p>The holy residents of Jerusalem shared their precious city with these extremists who vacillated between genuinely attempting to best the Romans and pillaging their fellow Jews throughout the land of Israel for entertainment and personal gain. While Jerusalem was under siege, a guerrilla civil war raged in the hills of Jerusalem between these rival groups. During this crucial and perilous time, these militias slaughtered each other, sabotaged communal supplies laying waste to Jerusalem and its petrified residents. Eventually, the groups retreated to the Temple Mount. There were attempts to carry on business as usual, but even in those moments, the civil war was transplanted into the Temple. One incident involved rebels in disguise ambushing their rivals while they were pretending to offer sacrifices.</p>
<p>Power struggles and petty personal issues destroyed any chance the rebels may have had for military success. Without supplies, a common strategy, leadership, unity of purpose, or even unity of religious conviction, the siege choked the city of Jerusalem and its inhabitants. The vicious infighting weakened the rebels to the point that they practically handed the Romans the opportunity to burn Jerusalem and its prized temple to the ground. Eventually, the Romans waltzed through the city and ended our Second Temple period with brutality and cruelty.</p>
<p>Sinat chinam might refer to the general social mood of their time, but I think the rabbis intended to remind us that our divisiveness had the utilitarian effect of making us so weak that we could offer the Romans no military resistance. We had wasted it all fighting among ourselves. There’s no greater sinat chinam than sacrificing our fellow Jews for personal gain.</p>
<p>What was the price of our folly? According to Josephus, the Romans slaughtered 1.1 million Jewish souls during the Great Revolt. We also lost our temple.</p>
<p>It’s true, we lost our temple, but the Temple was constructed of stone, marble, and gold. It was a building. But over one million one hundred thousand people were killed during the Churban. These were people with parents and gradnparents, brothers and sisters, and sons and daughters.</p>
<p>Mourning for the temple is sentimental and admirable. It’s a religious act that demands multiple levels of understanding and sophisticated maneuvering of thoughts and feelings. Mourning our fallen Jewish brothers and sisters is essential and imperative. It’s a human act that should be so easy for us to appreciate. We’ve all experienced human tragedy in our lives to some degree.</p>
<p>If mourning the loss of well over a million lives makes Tisha b’Av resonates in our souls, then we should mourn that grave loss. It’s silly to ignore that pain in favor of the mental gymnastics required to properly mourn the loss of our temple. There’s nothing wrong with choosing the tragedy that we can more easily feel. It’s actually a wise choice.</p>
<p>Collectively, we’ve mourned a lot this summer already. We’ve cried for our kidnapped yeshiva students, twice. Once while we thought they were alive and then again when the truth slammed us over the head with its dull, throbbing pain. We’ve cried for fallen IDF soldiers, twice. Once for their safety and then again when we learn of their ultimate sacrifice. We’ve cried for non-military casualties of the war, twice. Once while we prayed for our welfare in Israel and abroad, and then again when lives are lost. It’s also appropriate to mourn for our cousins in Gaza, twice. Once for the regretful loss of non-combatant life in Gaza and then maybe even for militant life that could have been lived differently.</p>
<p>Tears are never far away these days. Tisha b’Av will always be a challenge, but perhaps we can channel what we’ve felt all summer into the next 36 hours. If we can even do a fraction of that, this year’s Tisha b’Av will be a great success. We have an opportunity to encoutner Tisha B’Av in a way many of us have never experienced it.</p>
