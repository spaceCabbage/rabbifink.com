				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life, so that you may live, you and your children.”</em> &#8211; Deuteronomy 30:19</p>
<p>As we near the end of the life and times of Moses, his speech to the Israelites picks up steam and power. One of the most profound statements in the Torah is found near the beginning of this week’s parsha. Moses tells the Israelites that heaven and earth bear witness that Moses has given the Israelites a choice. The ultimate choice. They can choose life or they can choose death. Then in dramatic fashion, the people are then instructed to choose life.<span id="more-7592"></span></p>
<p>Choose life! To life! <em>L’chaim</em>! This is the essence of Judaism. We toast to life. We sing to life. Life is a gift and we choose to use it well. The life we are given is a life of choices. We are instructed to make the choices that are the choices of life. It is so simple, yet so profound. Especially when we consider the religious leanings of the ancients, where death was so integral to their religions, where human sacrifice was normal, the Torah’s charge to choose life bellows loudly with its profundity and its eternal message echoes across the millennia.</p>
<p>This verse is an example of the best of the Bible. Its dramatic overtones staking out the all encompassing issues of the human experience. When our souls feel lost we must always remember to choose life. That is the great compass of Judaism. Find life and go that way. Choose life!<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7593" alt="choices" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/choices-600x449.jpg" /></p>
<p>For all its drama in the Bible, the Talmud brings this verse back down to earth with a shocking thud. Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva have a dispute about just what it means to choose life. Rabbi Yishmael says that “life” refers to a trade or a craft &#8211; the ability to earn a livelihood. We are being instructed to choose a means to make a living. Rabbi Akiva says that life refers to matters of safety and recreation like swimming and boating. Ti him, choosing life means taking care of one’s physical condition and making certain that one is prepared for a physical world that carries with it inherent danger.</p>
<p>These interpretations, while utilitarian and wise, seem to be so impossible to hear in the context of the verse that we are left to wonder if these great rabbi can actually be serious. Moses is building to a crescendo in his speech and he takes a break from the sublime to discuss career options and water sports? The verse was so powerful in its basic meaning, where is the depth and the beauty now?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is yes. Indeed, it is sublime to live a life engaged in the world. That is the climax. That is the greatest life that can be chosen. We are to be active participants in the economic and social structure of our world and to do so ever mindful and aware of G-D and one’s Judaism &#8211; that is life! To choose life is to to live a life. An actual life. A normal, productive, material life. When one lives that life to its fullest and lives one’s Judaism to the fullest we are truly choosing life.</p>
<p>Choosing life does not mean that one should cut their self off from society. Life is to live amongst men and women. But to live this life elevated and infused with spirituality as one lives amongst others &#8211; that is to choose life. There is a place for meditation and reflection or even temporary complete immersion into Torah and purely spiritual pursuits. But <em>u’vacharta b’chaim</em> &#8211; to choose life &#8211; is only when that is firmly welded to material pursuits and responsibility.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yishmael was the same great sage who famously argued with Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. In his statement about the topic of working for a living, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai taught that one should do G-D’s will and their work will be performed by others. Rabbi Yishmael argued that one should work the land and earn a livelihood. His views on this matter are clear. Life is to work.</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiva attached himself to Bar Kochba. He was not satisfied living under the rule of a despotic and anti-Semitic Roman government. He dreamed of autonomy and safety. The idea was to rise up and rebel militarily. With weapons and men at arms. Rabbi Akiva did not rely on his piety or Torah study to protect him or the people. Nor did he assume that his Torah study would be sufficient to restore the land into Jewish hands. Rabbi Akiva supported a physical army in addition to the merits of Torah and Mitzvos.</p>
<p>Choose life means choose to live a life engaged in the world all the while meticulously adhering to G-D’s word and living a life of Torah, Mitzvos and <em>Kiddush Hashem</em>. Indeed, this is a profound statement worthy of placement in the climactic peak of this speech of Moses. It is not just life, it is our way of life.</p>
<p>Speaking to his congregation following the Woodstock Festival in 1969, Rabbi Lamm talked about Hippie culture as compared to Judaism. Hippies believed that life was an opportunity to “live it up.” Love, music, and drugs were pathways to nirvana in their worldview.</p>
<p>To this, Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva respond and say we choose life with work. To live means to earn a livelihood. To live means to be prepared for life’s difficult moments. The truly virtuous life is not the life of shortcuts and temporarily highs. When we choose life we are choosing to live a life of challenges. We meet those challenges with Torah principles along with secular training. When we are able to navigate the difficult moments in our lives, when we can grow from trying times, when we use our gifts and talents to transcend the material world, then we are truly choosing life.</p>
<p>Hippies are passé. Woodstock a distant memory. But contemporary society has adopted so much of that worldview into modern thinking. Freedom and love are enough to give meaning to life and they are enough to truly live. Our response is that to truly find freedom and love we must work to get there. That is how we choose life. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

		<description><![CDATA[“The LORD will establish you for a holy people to Himself, as He has sworn to you; if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in His ways. And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the LORD is called upon you; and they shall be [...]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>“The LORD will establish you for a holy people to Himself, as He has sworn to you; if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in His ways. And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the LORD is called upon you; and they shall be afraid of you.” &#8211; Deuteronomy 28:9-10 </i></p>
<p>Before Moses delivers a litany of curses upon the Israelites he offers some words of hope and blesses the people. In summary, Moses tells the people that if they follow the word of G-D all kinds of good things will happen for them. <i>“You will blessed in the city and you will be blessed in the field.”</i> And so on.<span id="more-7558"></span></p>
<p>The incentive to be good is strong. One of the more powerful verses of blessing describes how we will be perceived by the nations of the world if we are obedient to G-D’s word. The verse tells us that people of the earth will “see G-D’s name upon us” and they will be afraid of us.</p>
<p>What is this fear? Why will the nations fear us? What is this name of G-D that arouses this fear?<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Ki-Savo-2013-Web-Dvar-Torah.pdf"><br />
</a><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7560" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/monumental-tefillin-600x448.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Talmud (Brachos 6a) says that R’ Eliezer teaches us that this “name of G-D” is the <i>Tefillin</i> that is worn upon the head. One has to wonder what R’ Eliezer means with this statement. Does he meant that if we wear our <i>tefillin </i>we will be protected from persecution and ridicule? Are the <i>tefillin</i> a magical talisman? Is it that simple? Is that even possible?</p>
<p>There are photos of great Jewish martyrs during the Holocaust wearing their <i>Tefillin</i>. It seems that the Nazis did not fear our <i>tefillin</i>. What happened? Was it just a matter of us not being worthy of the blessing? Exactly what is R’ Eliezer saying?</p>
<p>Rabbi Lamm explains R’ Eliezer’s statement by observing the context of the Talmudic passage. Immediately after R’ Eliezer says that the “name of G-D” upon us is the <i>tefillin </i>that is worn upon the head, the Talmud wonders about G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i></p>
<p>The Talmud asks: And what is written in G-D’s <i>tefillin</i>? In G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>we would find a verse lauding the Jewish people. “Who is like the Jewish people, one nation upon the earth?” Meaning, our <i>tefillin</i> speak to G-D’s unity as expressed in the four chapters we place inside, accordingly G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>speak to our unity. It’s a symbiotic relationship. We express G-D’s unity and G-D expresses ours.</p>
<p>In a novel twist, Rabbi Lamm proclaims that R’ Eliezer was not actually referring to our <i>tefillin </i>at all! Rather he was referring to G-D’s <i>tefillin!</i> That is the context of the <i>sugya. </i>In other words, when we live the maxim of G-D’s <i>tefillin</i> then the people of the earth will fear us. What is that maxim? That we have unity and that we are a singular nation.</p>
<p>When we are comfortable and confident in our singularity we succeed. R’ Eliezer is teaching us to be strong in our ability to stand on our own. If we can stand strong on our own, we inspire awe from the people of the earth. When we are not vying for approval or desperately trying to assimilate, we are demonstrating to the world the message of G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i> However, if do try to leave our Jewishness at home, or worse in the trash heap of history, the people of the earth will not find anything awesome about the Jewish people.</p>
<p>The idea is that when people are confident in their convictions and believe what they are doing is right, they earn the respect of others. Of course, this only applies when one is also respectful and kind to the others. Acting zealously because we think we are right and everyone else is wrong will undoubtably result in treatment in kind. If we are hateful toward others or act in a manner that breeds hate, we can expect to be treated at least as badly by those others. But there is a way to act in confidence with respect for others. This is exactly what R’ Eliezer was trying to say. When we are doing the right thing, with the confidence of G-D’s <i>tefillin</i> we earn the awe and reverence of others.</p>
<p>This is all on a national level. When the Jewish people as a whole act the way they are supposed to act, and we do so with confidence and pride, we gain the respect of others.</p>
<p>As much as it applies to us as a people, it applies to us as individuals as well. We can see this from the the man who taught us this lesson in the Talmud. It’s not just our confidence as a nation but also confidence as individual people.</p>
<p>R’ Eliezer lived this maxim. He found himself on the opposing side of the rabbis of his generation time and time again. His opinions are disproportionately unpopular. R’ Eliezer is most well known for the incident regarding the <i>tanur shel achnai</i> where his opinion differed from the other sages. But he stood by his convictions even inviting nature itself to testify on his behalf. It did not matter than his colleagues had the numbers. R’ Eliezer believed he was right. Ultimately, none of that mattered as we follow the majority in rabbinic disputes of halacha. Indeed, R’ Eliezer paid a price as he lived out his days in isolation as punishment for not acceding to the rabbis. But R’ Eliezer stood tall and true to his convictions. R’ Eliezer’s strength and confidence shines through this and other episodes in the Talmud. He lived the ideas G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i></p>
<p>As a people we struggle with this. On the one hand we have adapted and adopt from our surroundings over the course of our collective history. There is tension between this chameleon-like attitude toward our environment and our ancient traditions that sometimes put us at odds with our neighbors and their ideas. It requires us to dance around the raindrops sometimes. But we must remember that we believe we have the truth. We must be careful to be respectful and friendly to all who are not members of our group while we stand by our convictions with confidence.</p>
<p>Within Judaism we have subgroups as well. Each is entitled to believe it is doing Judaism the right way. However our confidence in our subgroup cannot allow us lose respect and courtesy to our co-religionists from other subgroups. If we pervert our confidence in our way of life with hate and demonization of others our confidence is mere braggadocio.</p>
<p>We certainly should feel that our way of life is the right way to live. Some subgroups excel at this while other languish in self-loathing. I think the least confident subgroup in Judaism is Modern Orthodoxy. This is not a criticism of the Modern Orthodox theology, rather it is a reflection of a sad reality that too many Modern Orthodox Jews feel second class.</p>
<p>All subgroups should feel confident that they are doing G-D’s will. All subgroups should be respectful of the other subgroups. Modern Orthodoxy should be proud of their way of life. There is no need to constantly defer to other subgroups. Modern Orthodoxy can be vibrant and viable in our world.</p>
<p>When Modern Orthodoxy can live confidently it will flourish. It will find G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>are easily discerned among Modern Orthodox Jews. With the deftness that only Modern Orthodoxy can possess, its people will inspire awe and wonder among the people of the earth, not least of which, the rest of the Jewish people. - <em>Good Shabbos</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angered, and swore, saying: Surely there shall not one of these men, even this evil generation, see the good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers. […] Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying: Thou also shalt not go in either;” &#8211; Deuteronomy 1:34-35, 37</em></p>
<p>Moses spend his final days exhorting the Israelites to follow the word of G-d. In addition to his encouragement, Moses reminds the Israelites of their short history and the events that brought them to this juncture on the banks of the Jordan River about to enter the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>The book begins with a recap of the story of the spies. Moses fills in some of the blanks in the story in this retelling of the tale. The people are reminded that none of the sinners from the incident would be entering the Land of Israel. Interestingly, Moses includes himself in those who would not be entering the Promised Land due to the sin of the spies.<span id="more-7376"></span></p>
<p>The problem is that the Torah tells us in Parshas Chukas that Moses would not enter the Land of Israel because of his sin at Mei Meriva. When Moses was supposed to draw water from a rock by speaking to it he sinned and that is the reason he was banned from the land. It was not because of the spies. What are we to make of these remarks by Moses? Why is he saying he won’t be going to Israel as a punishment for the incident with the spies?<img class="size-medium wp-image-7377 alignright" alt="Moses_Pleading_with_Israel" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Moses_Pleading_with_Israel-437x600.jpg" width="437" height="600" /></p>
<p>Throughout the sojourn in the desert, the Israelites doggedly complained to Moses. They were relentless. If it wasn’t water, it was bread. If it wasn’t bread, it was meat. If it wasn’t meat, it was vegetables. There was always something to complain about. Indeed, the Israelites logged numerous complaints to Moses.</p>
<p>R’ Schwab says that if we look at all the complaints, we notice that they all shared one common thread. The people repeatedly accused Moses of taking them out of Egpyt to die in the desert. They asked time after time “Why have you taken us out of Egypt?”</p>
<p>The essence of this complaint is that Moses was a rebel leader who decided on his own to flee Egypt. The people were blaming Moses for their circumstances. In order for this complaint to make sense the assumption must be that Moses was not following G-d’s word, rather he was doing as he pleased. When he was caught in a bind, the people called him on his supposed recklessness.</p>
<p>During the incident of the spies, the people complained to Moses. They said: And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them: &#8216;Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would we had died in this wilderness! &#8211; Number 14:2</p>
<p>It is the familiar canard. Moses was to blame for their troubles with the spies as well.</p>
<p>This despite the baselessness for their accusation. Moses was acting upon the word of G-d. He had no say in the itinerary. He was as much a passenger on the journey as the rest of the people. But still, he was being blamed. Worse, he was being accused of acting on his own accord and thus he was culpable.</p>
<p>Human nature is such that hearing something over and over again for forty years will inevitably have an impact on the person. It’s impossible for it not to make an impression on the person’s psyche. It’s not quite brainwashing, but it’s a similar principle. When we are told a lie so many times over the course of so many years it begins to wear on us. We start to think that it might even be true. We start to believe the negative publicity.</p>
<p>Maybe Moses heard these accusations so many times over the course of the last 40 years that he started giving them some credence. Their accusation that he did things on his own without the approval of G-d took it’s toll. He started to think that maybe he was doing things on his own.</p>
<p>That is why he hit the rock instead of talking to the rock. Moses made the colossal error of thinking that he was the one doing the decision making and not G-d. Subconsciously, he decided to hit the rock to do it his own way. For this he was punished.</p>
<p>Now, while recounting the story of the spies and the accusation that he was a lone ranger acting without G-d’s approval Moses tells the people how much he was affected by their complaints. He tells the Israelites that their constant complaining had an effect on him and when he hit the rock part of it was because of what the Israelites had been saying to him for all those years.</p>
<p>The reason Moses was punished was because he hit the rock. But maybe the reason he hit the rock was because of the sort of complaints he had been subject to for 40 years. Case in point, the sin of the spies and the accusations and insults which accompanied the incident. Moses was told too many times that he was a renegade leader. Eventually his mind fooled him into believing it, if only for just a millisecond. But the damage was done. Moses hit the rock. Thus Moses mentions that he has been punished and will not be entering the Land of Israel while recounting the story of the spies.</p>
<p>In our lives we hear a lot about ourselves. Our parents and teachers tell us what they think about us. Friends and acquaintances make us aware of their opinions. Bosses and co-workers may express their feelings about us. Spouses and children tell us all that we need to know about ourselves. What they say might be true, it might not be true, but it definitely makes a difference.</p>
<p>We have to place ourselves in situations where we hear the right things about ourselves. Too much praise or too much criticism can make a real impression on our own thoughts about ourselves. Whether it artificially inflates our sense of self-worth, or if it artificially deflates our self-confidence, what other say about us makes a difference. It is wise for us to consider our social environment and analyze how we are being talked about in our daily lives.</p>
<p>Conversely, we have a huge responsibility to think about what we say about others. When it comes to our children, we have so much to say about them. Are we critical? Are we honest about their failings? Do they hear how much we love them? Do they hear how proud we are of their accomplishments? Do they hear a barrage of criticism? Do they get reminded of their shortcomings or negative personality quirks regularly?</p>
<p>We have so much power over what our children think of themselves. It would be wise for us to maximize their feelings of confidence and imbue them with an honesty about rising up to their challenges. What we say about them in person and what they hear us say about them will make a very big difference in the way they think about themselves.</p>
<p>The Jewish people as a whole are routinely discussed in the public arena. They say we are too much or this, or too little of that. We hear Jews being talked about it all the time. We read descriptions of Jewish people or Jewish ideas. Hearing lies over and over will take a toll on our collective psyche. We need to be sure that we do not believe everything we hear about ourselves. We cannot allow negativity dictate our communal mood.</p>
<p>It can be hard to stonewall what we hear about us as a group or as individuals. But being aware of the potential harm in believing our own publicity is the first step in avoiding it.</p>
<p>Above all, we cannot neglect our incredible opportunity to positively shape how others think about themselves. There is no part of our lives that this is more important that how we deal with our children and spouses. Let us use this knowledge to shower those closest to us with love, affection, positivity, and honesty. <em>- Good Shabbos</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Nuremberg_chronicles_f_30r_2.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7279" alt="Nuremberg_chronicles_f_30r_2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Nuremberg_chronicles_f_30r_2-300x215.png" width="300" height="215" /></a>“And he said to them: &#8216;Lodge here this night, and I will bring you back word, as the LORD may speak to me&#8217;; and the princes of Moab abode with Bilaam. And G-D came to Balaam, and said: &#8216;What men are these with you?&#8217; And Bilaam said to G-D: &#8216;Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me…” &#8211; Numbers 22:8-10</em></p>
<p>Balak hires Bilaam to curse the Israelites so that Balak would beat them in battle. In addition to being a sought after sorcerer, Bilaam was a prophet. When we meet Bilaam he consults with G-D about this business opportunity. Their conversation indicates that Bilaam had quite a high level of prophecy and regularly spoke with G-D.</p>
<p>Our Sages explain that Bilaam was a great prophet and he was a necessary piece in G-D’s infinite plan. In order to rebut a possible argument by the Nations of the World that they too would have been as righteous as the Israelites if they had their own prophet as great as Moses, G-D gave them Bilaam.</p>
<p>The problem is that according to many commentaries Bilaam was a terrible person. Following his failed attempt to curse the Israelites he suggested a much less esoteric plan and far more practical. Bilaam advised Balak to send the maidens of Midian to seduce the Israelites. Only a wicked person would concoct such a disgusting plan. But if Bilaam was so evil, why was he the prophet chosen by G-D as the prophet of the Nations of the World? It hardly seems fair. The Nations of the World will simply demand a righteous prophet.</p>
<p>Further, assuming he was a wicked man the rest of the story is quite perplexing. Bilaam is rebuffed by an Angel of G-D and his donkey tries to convince him to reconsider his decision to curse the Israelites. Why is G-D sending Bilaam so many messages and giving him so many opportunities to turn around? Bilaam is a bad guy! Bad guys don’t get this kind of treatment from G-D! They are left to their own choices and they must live with the consequences.<span id="more-7273"></span></p>
<p>It seems that these questions might answer one another.</p>
<p>G-D had high hopes for Bilaam. He was supposed to be a great prophet. He was supposed to be almost as great as Moses. That was the Divine Plan.</p>
<p>Bilaam had all the tools to be just a notch below Moses. He was given incredible talents and abilities. G-D expected Bilaam to use these gifts properly. Bilaam was supposed to teach and inspire the Nations of the World. That was to be his role. Unfortunately he did not.</p>
<p>It’s not a question on G-D why the prophet of the Nations of the World was not a righteous person. It was Bilaam’s own fault. It was his choices that made him the person who he was.</p>
<p>This also explains the rest of the story. G-D was so hopeful, k’vyachol, that Bilaam would prove to be the prophet he was meant to be. The entire purpose of Bilaam’s purpose as a prophet was to be answer to the possible complaint of the Nations of the World that they had prophet like Moses. G-D so badly wished, k’vyachol, that Bilaam would be that prophet. G-D went to great lengths to help Bilaam be that man.</p>
<p>G-D tried to dissuade Bilaam from joining Balak’s emissaries. G-D places an angel of G-D in Bilaam’s path. G-D opened the mouth of a donkey to talk some sense into Bilaam. All these efforts were to preserve Bilaam’s purity in the hope that he could be the prophet the Nations of the World needed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it did not work out the way G-D planned. Bilaam was undeterred and fell into the depths of the spiritual abyss. G-D does not control Bilaam’s righteousness. Only Bilaam can control that. As much as G-D, k’vyachol, would have loved for Bilaam to be like Moses, it was not within G-D’s control to make that happen.</p>
<p>Seeing this sliver of G-D is profoundly inspiring. The Bilaam saga shows us a G-D who is cheering us from the sidelines. Ours is a G-D who so badly wants us to succeed, k’vyachol. G-D was rooting for Bilaam and G-D is rooting for us.</p>
<p>Life presents us with challenges and we can find ourselves frustrated by our failures. We might question whether we can fulfill our mission in life. It can be a lonely world.</p>
<p>The story of how interested G-D was in Bilaam’s success is so reassuring and comforting to us today. G-D wanted Bilaam to vanquish his demons and prevail in his challenges. G-D does the same for us. Like a father rooting for his child at a Little League game, the Bilaam saga tells us that G-D wants us to win and G-D wants us to be heroes in our personal battles.</p>
<p>More than the narrative of the failed curses of Bilaam, we learn from the story something very profound that impacts our relationship with G-D. We see what it means to live in a world with a caring, loving G-D. We see what it means to have a relationship with G-D. It means that we can count on our biggest Fan cheering us on and motivating us to succeed.</p>
<p>Our job description as parents, teachers, and role models is to emulate the way G-D interacts with us. There are people who turn to us for love and support. We must make sure that they know that we are following the lead of G-D and we are permanently in their corner cheering them on. Children especially need to know that we are there for them no matter what. We cannot live their lives for them but they must feel our love and care so that they can meet life’s challenges with the confidence to know that no matter what their parents are their rock to lean upon for strength.</p>
<p>Similarly in our personal relationships, we must cheer for one another. Another person’s success must be viewed as our success. When we stand behind one another and hope for the best for everyone around us, we too are emulating G-D. We also reap the rewards of living in the loving, caring society of our dreams. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/torah_study.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7237" alt="torah_study" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/torah_study-300x223.jpg" width="300" height="223" /></a>“Concerning this it is told in the account of the Wars of the Lord, &#8220;What He gave at the [Sea of] Reeds and the streams of Arnon.” &#8211; Numbers 21:14</i></p>
<p>The Torah connects the miracles at the Sea of Reeds with the miracles at the streams of Arnon. We are very familiar with the splitting of the sea and the drowning of the Egyptians as the waves crashed down upon them. At the streams of Arnon, Amonites and Moabites were waiting for the Israelites and planned to ambush them. G-D saved the Israelites by crushing the soldiers lying in wait with the mountains they were using for cover. The twin peaks merged together destroying the people lying in wait. The verse tell us that these fantastic miracles are recorded in the book of the Wars of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Hebrew words for “what He gave at [the Sea of] Reeds” are “et vahev b’Sufa.” In the Talmud, our Sages ask what <i>drasha </i>we can learn from the words in Psalms (127) “et oyvim b’shaar &#8211; the enemies at the gates?” The Talmud answers in name of R’ Chiya bar Abba that even a father and son or a teacher and student that study Torah in one gateway become enemies when they argue about the Torah and they do not budge from their position until they love one another, as the verse says “et vahev b’Sufa.” Rashi explains that the Talmud is referencing the mention of the book of the Wars of the Lord and is playing on the word vahev which is similar to the word ahava &#8211; love, and is saying that the battles of Torah (the Wars of the Lord) end in love.</p>
<p>R’ Schwab asks the obvious question here. This is a very farfetched <i>drasha.</i> What possible connection could there be between the splitting of the seas, the crushing of potential ambushers by way of mountains, and the intense study of Torah with a partner?<span id="more-7236"></span></p>
<p>We can understand the teaching of the Talmud if we examine the true nature of the miracles being referenced here. There were several miracles at the Sea of Reeds, but the miracle recognized here is the demise of the Egyptians in the raging waters of the sea. The waters split for the sake of the Israelites. It was a necessary measure to save the Israelites from certain death. Once the danger passed there was no longer a need for the miracle and the miraculous forces that were keeping a dry path in the sea stopped holding the waters back. As soon as there was no force splitting the sea, the waters returned to their natural, original position and the Egyptians drowned in the crashing waters.</p>
<p>Similarly, the miracle at Nachal Arnon was the merging of two mountains to crush the enemy. In essence, says R’ Schwab, the two mountains were really one mountain with two peaks. They were supposed to be one mountain but were only two peaks for the sake of giving a path for the Israelites to pass. To crush the would-be ambush all that was required was a suspension of the miracles separating the two peaks. Once the force keeping the mountain in two parts stopped, the mountain naturally crushed the ambush.</p>
<p>When fathers and sons or teachers and students study Torah they become enemies. They take different positions on matters of great importance. They disagree on the correct understanding, message, or interpretation. They argue for their point of view and fight for their position. It looks like there is a legitimate war. But the truth is that this schism is a mirage. Their true status is a state of peace and love. It’s just that through arguing in the Battles of Torah they take positions that are at odds. Love is their natural position.</p>
<p>The Talmud is saying that the same way the waves crashing on the Egyptians and the mountains crushing the ambushers was the previously held unnatural state returning to its natural state, “et vahev b’Sufa” can refer to the natural state of love between opponents in the Battles of the Torah. Even though they appear to be at odds, they are really only temporarily arguing. Their true state is peace, love, and harmony. The <i>drasha </i>is not so farfetched after all.</p>
<p>Never in the history of the Jewish people have so many people had the opportunity to hear so many different perspectives and ideas about Judaism. Hundreds and thousands of years ago, people were exposed only to the small group of people they knew personally. Eventually, books were published with slight variances of tradition and thought but generally speaking, people knew what they knew and they did what they did. Our modern society has opened the floodgates of information. This is a great blessing. We have access to more Torah than we ever had before. But we must now contend with many more competing views of religion in general, Judaism, and Orthodox Judaism. As a group we have a lot of opinions and we are passionate about our ideas.</p>
<p>Sometimes the discussions and disagreements can get heated. After all, it is the Battle of the Torah otherwise known as the Wars of the Lord! There is so much at stake and there is so much to learn and to discuss. We all have opportunities to hear new ideas and learn from others. We also have a chance to share our perspectives and opinions. This is wonderful. But we cannot forget that despite our differences, they are only superficial. Disagreement is not our natural state. Our arguments are only for the sake of Torah and G-D. We must be sure that when our arguments end we find ourselves in our natural state of peace, love, and harmony.</p>
<p>What a poignant thought for our generation. In a world of international discussion and debate via the Internet we can never forget that when our learning is over we leave the conversation with the love of a father to a son. Certainly, in our face to face interactions, Shabbos table discussions, coffee room shmoozing, and of course learning in the Beis Medrash we always remember that it ends in our natural state of love and affection toward each other. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/disunity.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7210" alt="disunity" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/disunity.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>“Put fire therein, and put incense upon them before the Lord tomorrow; and it shall be that the man whom the Lord does choose, he shall be holy; you take too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi.”</em> &#8211; Numbers 16:7</p>
<p>In this week’s parsha, Korach challenges the legitimacy of Moses’ leadership. It was something of a suicide mission as Korach knew that if he was wrong, he would die. But why would Korach risk his life? By all accounts Korach was smart and ambitious, not a fool. What was Korach thinking?</p>
<p>Rashi quotes the Medrash that says that the “you take too much upon yourselves” can be interpreted Midrashically to mean “I have told you about a great thing.” This explains Korach’s folly. Through prophecy, Korach saw a vision that he would have very special descendants and believed that he would be spared in their merit.</p>
<p>This vision emboldened Korach and he proceeded with his rebellion with confidence that he would survive the ordeal. It was Korach’s hubris that did him in. He thought that if his descendants were righteous it gave validity to his mission. In truth, his sons repented before the ground swallowed Korach and his rebels. It was their descendants who Korach saw in his prophecy.</p>
<p>Rabbeinu Chananel says that Korach and his group were Levites. R’ Shteinman points out that this means that the sin of this group was different than the other sins of the Israelites in the desert. Starting with the sin of the Golden Calf, the Levites abstained from sin. The Levites were able to withstand the temptation of sin throughout the sojourn in the desert. Until Korach.</p>
<p>What happened? Why was Korach the Levite susceptible to sin in this instance?<span id="more-7209"></span></p>
<p>R’ Shteinman directs us to a passage in Duties of the Heart to answer this question. A sinner who repents has an advantage over a righteous person who has never sinned. A pure person without sin can become overconfident in his or her ability not to sin. One who never sinned can become so arrogant about not sinning that it could lead one to sin. However, one who sinned and repented is always on the lookout so that one will not sin again. In this respect, the sinner who repented has a leg up on the one who has never sinned.</p>
<p>To illustrate: A righteous person said to a students “If you had never sinned I would be afraid of something worse than sin for your sake.” The students asked “What could be worse than sin?” The teacher replied “Arrogance.”</p>
<p>This explains how Korach could fall despite his Levite heritage. In fact, being a Levite contributed to his susceptibility to this particular sin. This sin was a sin of hubris. Korach thought that his prophetic vision of righteous descendants vindicated his cause. This is pure arrogance. The prophetic vision was ambiguous but Korach’s overconfidence walked him down the path of destruction.</p>
<p>It is true that the Levites resisted sin in the desert. But even they were not immune to the precipitous fall that begins with hubris.</p>
<p>There are two types of sins. One type of sin is a result of overwhelming passion or irreverent apathy. These are the sins we are most well equipped to avoid. We can withstand temptation or we can simply care. But sins that are caused by arrogance are a completely different brand of sin. These are sins that are so much harder to avoid because our arrogance blinds us to the sin and then it is too late.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes. We all fail sometimes. Many of our mistakes or failures are due to poor judgment or apathy. These mistakes are egregious but the problem is fixable. However when we make mistakes because we are arrogant or overconfident, we may not even see our mistakes until they are in our rear view mirror. We don’t even see it coming.</p>
<p>The only thing worse than sin is arrogance.</p>
<p>In our existing and potential relationships we must be so careful not to allow arrogance to blind us. We are at our worst when we feel superior to others. Arrogance makes us judgmental and pushes us to be divisive. We are at our best when we realize that we have so much to learn from everyone around us. Humility makes us see others favorably and pushes us toward unity.</p>
<p>Now we come full circle. Korach was arrogant. This caused him to rebel and create division. The antidote is humility. We will achieve unity when we are able to see the good in others and acknowledge that our differences make us a stronger unit than we would be if we were all the same. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4590176018_086a2de7ab_o.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7149" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4590176018_086a2de7ab_o-300x227.jpg" width="300" height="227" /></a>“And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.” &#8211; Number 14:1</em></p>
<p>Upon hearing the negative report of the spies about the Land of Canaan, the Israelites were forlorn. They believed they would have no chance of conquering the land and so they wept. The Talmud tells us in the name of Rabbi Yochanan that the night they wept was the 9th of Av. God told the Israelites that they cried for no reason on 9th of Av in the desert so God would give them a real reason to cry in the future. It seems that our first and second temples were destroyed on the 9th of Av as retribution for the communal sin of the spies and their slander.</p>
<p>The Book of Lamentations wails over the destruction of the first temple. According to the Talmud it also hints at the reasons for the destruction. Each of the first four chapters of the book forms an acrostic with the first letter of each sentence forming the Hebrew alphabet. In the Hebrew alphabet the letter Ayin precedes the letter Peh. However, the verse in Lamentations chapter 1 beginning with the letter Peh precedes the verse beginning with the letter Ayin. This is because the Peh, which can also refer to the mouth, jumped ahead of the Ayin, which can also refer to the eye. The spies spoke about things that their eyes did not see and so the Peh precedes the Ayin in Lamentations to allude to the sin that caused the destruction of the temple.</p>
<p>There is a problem with this interpretation.<span id="more-7148"></span> The problem is that it seems from the Talmud that the sin of the spies related to saying something with their mouths that they did not see. That’s a very normal way Lashon Hara, evil speech, is spread. But according to the text of the story, the spies merely reported what they actually did see. They saw a land that swallows its inhabitants. They saw giants. They even brought huge fruits as souvenirs. The spies editorialized a bit, yet we would never say that they spoke about what they did not see. How does this teaching of the Talmud fit in with the facts of the story from the text of the Book of Numbers?</p>
<p>Rabbi Shimon Schwab offers a beautiful explanation. R’ Schwab says that people see things the way that they alone see them. In other words, our personality, attitude, feelings, and experience color what our eyes see. Two people can look at the same thing and one can see spiritual beauty and the other can see physical beauty. Or two people can look at the same thing and one can see something ugly and the other can see something beautiful. It’s a matter of perspective and perception.</p>
<p>Take someone who knows nothing about the Jewish people or the history of Israel and show them the Kotel. That person will see rocks. Big rocks. And a wall. But take a person with an appreciation for its holiness and that person will see the grandeur of the Kotel as a place of worship and spirituality. It all depends on the person who is looking.</p>
<p>Similarly, the spies went to the Land of Canaan. They could have seen its inherent spiritual beauty. They could have seen the incredible opportunities for religious life and personal growth present in the land. But their eyes were not tuned into those things. The spies were only able to see the land with material vision. They could only appreciate the physical attributes of the land. They saw death and giants and large produce. They did not see the spiritual value of the land. The spies should have seen the Divine Presence on Mount Moriah. They should have felt the holiness of Hebron. But they did not. Why? Because they were using their eyes that were focused only on material things, not spiritual reality.</p>
<p>This explains why the Peh preceded the Ayin. The mouth spoke what the eyes did not see. The eyes should have seen a land of holiness and spirituality. The mouth spoke what it did not see. The mouth spoke of physical flaws and challenges. The spiritual eyes of the spies were closed and they did not see what they should have seen. This was the cause of their demise.</p>
<p>Every situation in our lives and in the public discourse has at least one way of looking at it. The way one sees something is influenced by their personality, experience, and feelings. Although we may be convinced our way is the correct way there is always another way to look at the same facts and draw different conclusions.</p>
<p>This is an important lesson in a global community. We live in a world where people with varied life experiences and environments, thus we are bound to see the same things through different lenses. Understanding that we can see the same things as another person and arrive at completely different conclusions is necessary in our modern world.</p>
<p>We must take the lesson of the spies and use the right glasses to see things the right way. But we also must understand that when others see things differently than we do, often it is because they are different people with a different pair of glasses. Knowing this, we can take steps to further our understanding and appreciation of others and their ideas bringing us closer to a day of peace among all inhabitants of the earth. Good Shabbos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/action.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5652" title="action" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/action-264x300.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="300" /></a>Parshas Nasso deals with two interesting commandments. The first is the law of Sota. Should a man suspect his wife of an adulterous affair, the Torah provides a miraculous method of ascertaining her innocence or guilt. She was brought to the Temple and was given a special concoction to drink. If she was innocent the waters would taste sweet plus she would be blessed with a child. However, if she was guilty, the waters would taste bitter and cause her body to violently explode in a horrible death.</p>
<p>One could imagine the interest such an event would garner. I am sure many people would be very intrigued by this procedure and throngs of people would attend to see just what would happen with this woman.</p>
<p>Directly following the section that teaches us about the Sota. The Torah tells us about the Nazir. A Nazir was someone who wished to live an ascetic life. He would vow not to become ritually impure, he would abstain from drinking wine and would not cut his hair for a specific period of time. Although the Torah does not promote an ascetic existence, the Torah does allow for this form of spiritual growth via the Nazir experience.</p>
<p>The Talmud wonders why Sota is immediately followed by Nazir in the Torah. Normally there is some connection between juxtaposed sections in the Torah. What is the connection between the Sota and the Nazir? Answers the Talmud: “Kol ha’roeh Sota b’kilkula, yazir atzmo min ha’yayin”. Whomever shall see a Sota in her disgrace (ie when she should abstain from wine as a Nazir.</p>
<p>Typically, this is understood to mean that since infidelity can caused by alcohol abuse. One who sees its ugly end would want to ensure the same result not happen to him. Says the Talmud, the best cure for that is to abstain from alcohol via the vow of the Nazir.<span id="more-5651"></span></p>
<p>This is wonderful advice. However, it seems to be a bit counterintuitive. One who has just witnessed the Sota die a violent, horrific death would be the last person we would think who would commit an act of adultery! What better guard against infidelity could there be than to see the Sota’s demise? Why should a person who has seen this be so concerned with the same happening to them? He would be the last one that we should be concerned with?!</p>
<p>Around the corner from Ner Israel in Baltimore MD there was a sign on the side of the road. The sign had an electronic display of the number of deaths by people not wearing seat belts in their cars. The number kept going up. When people noticed the sign it probably made an impact on them. Before cars incessantly reminded you to fasten your seat beat, plenty of people did not use their seat belts. Did they buckle-up after they saw the sign? Maybe once or twice. But by and large, people did not change their habits after seeing the sign. Why not?</p>
<p>The reason is that just because one sees something that reminds them of the right thing, does not mean that they will change their behavior. Inspiration is fleeting. A sign will give a person reason to pause for a moment. But changing one’s life takes real work; real steps to make that change.</p>
<p>Witnessing a Sota in her disgrace is surely a frightening and powerful experience. But the feelings of inspiration won’t last. If you want them to last you need to take action, do real work, make those first real steps to change. That is why one should abstain from wine via the vow of the Nazir. Doing so makes certain that the true desire one has to avoid a cause for sin will take hold. Inspiration and ideas are not enough to create change. Only action creates change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/chinese_tea.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5593" title="chinese_tea" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/chinese_tea-300x234.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="234" /></a>This week we read the double parsha of Behar and Bechukosai. Behar mostly deals with the laws of Shmita, the Sabbath of the land, and Yovel, the Jubilee celebration every 50 years. The parsha begins with these words:</p>
<p><em>“And God spoke to Moses at mount Sinai, saying: Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you come into the land which I give you, then the you shall keep a sabbath on the land to God.”</em></p>
<p>Rashi quotes a medrash that asks the Talmudic version of “What does that have to do with the price of tea in china?” In this context, the question is “what does the obligation to keep the Shmita have to do with Mount Sinai?” In other words, why does the Torah emphasize that this mitzvah was given at Sinai?</p>
<p>The answer, says the medrash, is to teach us that just as this mitzvah was given at Sinai with all its details, similarly, all the mitzvos given at Sinai were given with all their details. The Torah goes into more detail about the mitzvah of shmita than some of the other mitzvahs. The details of other mitzvahs were given as part of the oral tradition. The verse reminds us that just as all the details of this mitzvah were given at Sinai (in the written Torah) so too all the details of the other mitzvahs were given at Sinai (albeit in the oral Torah).</p>
<p>This answer begs a new, perhaps bigger question.<span id="more-5592"></span> Why did the Torah teach us this lesson in the context of shmita? There are 613 mitzvahs in the Torah. Any of them could have been elucidated in the written Torah and juxtaposed with a superfluous usage of the words Mount Sinai and we would have been able to learn the very same lesson? Is there something unique that we can learn from the fact that the Torah used the mitzvah of shmita to teach us this lesson?</p>
<p>R’ Schwab answers with an important insight.</p>
<p>Many “scholars” have challenged the authenticity of the Torah. They argue that the Torah was written by humans and was not the word of God. They claim that the Torah is just another book, like any other.</p>
<p>Obviously, we vehemently disagree. We adamantly insist that the Torah is Divine. It is the word of God and along with written Scripture, a Divine communication called the oral law taught us all the details of those complicated laws.</p>
<p>Some mitzvahs sound like a man could have thought of them. The civil code is pretty similar to the civil code of many ancient peoples. The prohibitions against murder and theft are reasonable enough that a human could have thought of them on his own.</p>
<p>However the mitzvah of shmita is one of the least likely mitzvahs to have been invented by humans. The law requires that we let the land lie fallow once every seven years. This is a good idea as it gives the land time to regenerate its nutrients. But it is incredibly dumb to force everyone to have their land lie fallow in the same year! Without some sort of Divine Assistance the entire country would starve. A terrible human plan.</p>
<p>No human author would have legislated a law like that. This law in particular, speaks to the Divine authorship of the Torah.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why the Torah uses this specific mitzvah to teach us that the all of the written Torah and the oral tradition have their origins at Sinai and can be attributed to God alone.</p>
<p>Next week we celebrate Shavuos, the day that we received the Torah from the Almighty. I can think of no better lesson the glean from this week’s Torah reading.</p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Tazria-Metzora<br />
Toras HaYoledes</h2>
<p>The study of <em>smichas haparshiyos</em> always reveals fascinating insights into the inner meanings of Torah. Text and context are so vital in shaping the values and mores that are to shape our outlook as well. One significant message is presented by Chazal as we traverse the <em>yesodos</em> of <em>parshas</em> Shimini, read last week, and begin the study of <em>parshas</em> Metzorah this Shabbos. It is a bridge which reminds us of the proper context of our <em>avodas </em>Hashem still today.</p>
<p>Chazal note that <em>parshas</em> Shmini concludes by summing up the laws of <em>kashrus</em> using the phrase, “<em>zos Toras habihama.” </em>Our <em>parsha</em> begins with the renewal of human existence and the birth of children entering the world and the words “<em>zos Toras hayoledes.”</em> The commentaries wonder why the <em>Toras habihama</em> precedes the <em>Toras haadam</em>. Surely, it is people who are the focus of creation. Shouldn’t we study the creation of man and then follow it with the <em>Toras habihama?</em> What is to be understood from the sequence of these <em>psukim</em>?<span id="more-5455"></span></p>
<p>To answer this question, the Midrash introduces the <em>parsha</em> with the <em>posuk</em> from Tehillim (139:4) <em>Achor vakedem tzartani</em> <em>— “</em>backwards and forwards You shaped me<em>.” </em>Says R’ Yishmael bar Tanchum <em>“Achor l’chal hamaasim v’kodem l’chol ha’onshim&#8230;— </em>you are last with regards to your actions (you are the pinnacle of creation), yet you are the first for all of consequences (if you abuse life)<em>.”  </em>The Midrash continues—if you are worthy then all of creation was prepared for you. However if <em>r”l</em> one is unworthy then even the gnat has preceded you in<em> ma’aseh breishis. </em></p>
<p>The message of this lesson is powerful. Of all the creatures of the world, only human kind needs guidance and training to be successful. Beavers need not attend engineering school. Fish do not take swimming lessons and bees are exempt from food chemistry courses. It is only people that need education and coaching to master their destiny and fulfill their role in this world. Our performance is in our own hands. Chazal are reminding us that the sequence of <em>Toras habihama</em> preceding <em>Toras haadam</em> is to deliver context and meaning to our spiritual destiny. If we learn, study and continually grow, then the <em>Toras habihama</em> and indeed, the entire world is the gift which greets us to enjoy a beautiful world filled with all of His bounty. By providing us a world ready with all that we need, Hakadosh Baruch Hu has given each of us all of the tools we could possibly desire to achieve our spiritual destiny. We can rise to the apex of piety and the spiritual nirvana toward which we aspire to soar.  But, if the gift of life and the opportunity to do <em>mitzvos</em> are not taken advantage of, and His bountiful blessings are wasted through our apathy, indifference and self-centered laziness, resulting in sin, then we are truly no different than the insignificant gnat created early on in the six days of creation. In fact we are worse. They, after all, are fulfilling their prescribed role but we, who have free choice, are not doing ours. What a waste.</p>
<p>As we progress through the “count-up” to Shavuos, this lesson is a vital reminder of our personal and national mission as an <em>ohr l’amim</em>. We can only illuminate the world if we are willing to use His gifts to bring <em>kavod</em> and glory to His name through our actions. That is the true purpose of life, to take the <em>Toras habihama</em> and all of the <em>olam hagashmi</em> it symbolizes and sanctify it through the spiritual potential of <em>Toras haadam</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/shamash_drip.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4975" title="shamash_drip" alt="" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/shamash_drip-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>Separation of Church and State is widely regarded as a modern concept. For most of the world this is an accurate assessment. In some places in the world there remains no separation. What I mean by a separation between church and state is that quite simply there are two different and exclusive bodies that legislate religion and politics. Political leadership is vested in one person or group and religious considerations are seen to by a different person or group.</p>
<p>In the United States, I believe separation of church and state is a misnomer. It&#8217;s not that there is a separation as much as the state has no opinion on religion. I think that a truer version of a separation between church and state originated with ancient Judaism.</p>
<p>The law was that the political leadership of the Jewish people flowed through the Davidic family of the tribe of Judah. The religious leaders in ancient Israel were the priests and the Levites who were are members of the tribe of Levi. These two groups were separate. This separation of powers was to ensure that no group had absolute power. It created a balance between political and domestic interests and religious interests. It was a good system and I believe the model for today&#8217;s separation.<span id="more-4974"></span></p>
<p>The story of Chanukah tells the tale of the Hasmonean family rebelling against the oppressive Seleucid-Greeks. This family was a priestly family. They sough to restore honor and holiness to the Temple. They also sought political autonomy from the Seleucid-Greeks.</p>
<p>They won both.</p>
<p>At that moment that they won they should have appointed a Davidic heir to the throne. But they failed to do so. A Hasmonean was anointed king and this began a slow fall from grace for the Hasmoneans. Not one Hasmonean remained after several generations of intermarriage and intra-violence. The Rabbis of the Talmudic era cite their error in taking the throne as the reason for their ultimate colossal failure.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Hasmoneans did not separate church and state. They were the kings and the priests at the same time and carried absolute power. As time has proven time and time again, absolute power corrupts absolutely. The Hasmoneans ended up in the scrap heap of history because of their failure in this regard.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of candles on our Chanukah menorah. There are the candles that we light each light. On the first night we light one and the second night we light two and we continue adding candles for eight night. By lighting these candles we fulfill a religious obligation to light these candles as instituted by the great rabbis of the Mishnah. We light candles and create holiness.</p>
<p>However there is another candle. The shamash is the candle we use to light the nightly candles. It does not factor into the religious nightly lighting. It is a functional candle, not a holy candle. It is a candle whose name, shamash can mean &#8220;caretaker&#8221;. The shamash is the lighter. But it is not the candle of the mitzvah.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the requirement that we use a shamash was a wink from the rabbis of the Mishnah reminding us why the Hasmoneans were such a disaster. They did not separate the political from the religious. The functional and holy were too closely intertwined. The political leaders were from the same family as the religious leaders.</p>
<p>Chanukah remembers their initial success but the lighting of the Chanukah candles reminds us of their ultimate failure. They did not separate church and state. On our Chanukah menorah we do separate church and state. We light holy candles to do a mitzvah. We light those candles with a separate, purely functional candle.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not quite sure how to relate this idea to contemporary Chanukah celebrations and the current state of Jewish affairs. But I am pretty sure there is a message in there that reminds us that sometimes we and our leaders need to hear alternative voices. That a <em>kinas sofrim</em> among Jews is a good thing and helps us fine tune our personal observance. There cannot be just one way, with one leadership, with one set of ideas. There must be multiple voices. There can&#8217;t be absolute power because is absolutely corrupts. Just ask as the shamash.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stack_of_gold_coins.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4785" title="stack_of_gold_coins" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stack_of_gold_coins-300x227.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="227" /></a>The Torah tells us (14:12) that some time after Lot left Avram’s home Lot was captured by the warring kings. They took Lot all his possessions and then they left Sodom.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lot began this week’s Torah portion as a righteous person. He stayed with Avram even as Avram left his homeland. Lot remained at Avram’s side even as Avram made a dangerous trip to Egypt. Avram even considers Lot a brother as he says (13:18) “we are like brothers”. They like brothers – not in blood, rather in righteousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yet, somewhere along the way, Lot got lost. He deviated from the path that was set forth by Avram and the path upon which he had accompanied Avram for all those years. The verse tells us (13:14) that “GD spoke to Avram after Lot parted company from him” and the Medrash Tanchuma explains that GD waited until Lot left the presence of Avram to speak with Avram. In the words of the Medrash: “GD did not want to speak Avram so long as the ‘wicked’ Lot was with Avram”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rav Schwab wonders what happened to Lot? He started on the right path. He was Avram’s “brother”. How did he become someone the Medrash describes as wicked?<span id="more-4784"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rav Schwab suggests that the above quoted verse hints at the answer. &#8220;And they took Lot and his possessions, the nephew of Avram&#8221;. The clause that separates Lot from Avram is “his possessions”. And that is exactly what separated Lot from Avram – his possessions. Lot’s money and his approach to material wealth separated him from Avram physically and spiritually.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When presented with the opportunity to stay with Avram or choose a new life, Lot chose to pursue a new life of materialism. Lot chose the area in ancient Israel that valued money above all else. Lot’s desire for wealth and status bumped him off the path of Avram.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Avram was a wealthy man, but his choices were still guided by morality. Lot made wealth his priority and morality was secondary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In our lives, there are many times when we are given a choice between what will enrich us spiritually and what will enrich us materially. We hope that we can follow the path of Avram and choose life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have so many opportunities to be generous, to give to others, to help out and be like our great grandfather Avram. We cannot allow things like status or money come between us the way it came between Avram and Lot. If we are successful, we will have created the kind of environment that spawned a Yitzchak, Yaakov and nation of Israel and we will see the same kind of result in our homes and communities.</p>

The Torah tells us the underlying reason for the punishments described. (Deut. 28:45, 47)</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">בָאוּ עָלֶיךָ כָּל הַקְּלָלוֹת הָאֵלֶּה, וּרְדָפוּךָ וְהִשִּׂיגוּךָ, עַד, הִשָּׁמְדָך ְוְהִשִּׂיגוּךָ, עַד, הִשָּׁמְדָךְ:  כִּי-לֹא שָׁמַעְתָּ, בְּקוֹל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ&#8211;לִשְׁמֹר מִצְו‍ֹתָיו וְחֻקֹּתָיו, אֲשֶׁר צִוָּךְ</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">.תַּחַת, אֲשֶׁר לֹא-עָבַדְתָּ אֶת-יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ, בְּשִׂמְחָה, וּבְטוּב לֵבָב&#8211;מֵרֹב, כֹּל</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p><em>And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep His commandments and His statutes which He commanded thee.</em></p>
<p><em>Because thou didst not serve the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things.</em></p>
<p>It seems from these verses that our lack of joy while performing mitzvos caused our demise.</p>
<p>The Talmud states (Brachos 6b): Said R’ Chalbo in the name of R’ Huna &#8211; one who partakes in a wedding and does not congratulate the groom violates five mentions of the word “voice”… Said R’ Nachman the son of Yitzchak &#8211; and if he does, what is his reward? It is if he rebuilt one of the dilapidating buildings in Jersualem.</p>
<p>R’ Schwab asks what is the correlation between giving joy to a groom and rebuilding the city of Jerusalem?<span id="more-4622"></span></p>
<p>Looking at the curses in this week’s parsha we can find the correlation. The destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple were the fulfillment of curses enumerated in this week’s parsha. The Torah tells us that our failure to serve GD with joy was the fatal flaw that brought on the curses. We did the mitzvos but we did them with a kvetch. We had no passion for mitzvos. This led to the destruction of the Temple.</p>
<p>The mitzva of bringing joy to a groom is an easy way to fix that fatal flaw. It is literally impossible to perform this mitzva without joy. One cannot bring joy to another without feeling joy. When we bring joy to the groom (and the bride) we are performing a very important mitzva. Helping the bride and groom celebrate their special day is tantamount to repairing the destruction of Jerusalem. Perhaps even more importantly it undoes the very thing that “did us in” in the first place. It trains us to do all of our mitzvos with joy and happiness. We need to pray with joy. We need to give charity with joy. We need to make our kosher conscious decision with joy. We need to study Torah with joy. We need to dance at a wedding with joy. Through this joy we can mend the tear in our hearts and souls that was formed with the destruction of our Temple.</p>
<p>As we approach Rosh Hashana, it is a great opportunity to try our best to improve our mitzva observance. We can use these next couple of weeks to add joy to our mitzvos. We can add a smile to our day. We can infuse our actions with more joy. Done properly, we can rebuild Jerusalem.</p>

<h2>Parshas Achrei Mos – Erev Pesach<br />
Don’t Settle</h2>
<p>This year we are gifted with reading parshas Acharei Mos right before Pesach. One challenge in the parsha beckons our attention as we get ready for our sedarim. Its message is pivotal in striving to reach Pesach perfection.</p>
<p>We are told that Hashem Yisborach too Bnai Yisrael, Kmaasei Eretz Mitzrayimn asher yashavtem ba lo sa’asu….“Do not  do as the people of Egypt where we once dwelled did.” One cannot help but wonder &#8211; why would they (or we)?  With the maror, the bitter taste of servitude still fresh in their mind, with the Matzoh, the lechem oni still fresh on their palate, the gravity and power of the eser makkos freshly witnessed and the miracle of geula having miraculous unfolded in front of their eyes, could they have really consider wanting to be like their captors, the Mitrzrim who had so debasingly enslaved them?  Even now, with the sipur yitzeas mitzrayim experienced at our Seder table annually, do we really need to be admonished to not be like them?<span id="more-4140"></span></p>
<p>The commentaries ponder this very question. The approach of the Kli Yakar is one which is haunting, yet so vital in reaching the zenith of the Seder’s potential. The Kli Yakar takes us back to the conclusion of parshas Vayigash where we are told Vayeishev Yisrael beretz Mitzrayim…Vayeachazu bah. Klal Yisrael “settled-in” to Mitzrayim with gusto. Indeed, he writes, “kol Pasuk zeh bashmas bnei Yisreal…ki Hakadosh Baruch Hu gazar aleihem ki ger yihyeh zarachem, vheima bikshu lihyos toshavim! We were supposed to have been Geirim, strangers, mere visitors in Mitzrayim but instead, we “settled-in.” Says the Kli Yakar, it was Klal Yisrael’s “settling- in” to the Mitzri civilization that was their downfall. Golus begins when we forget where we belong. Geula begins when we realize we don’t belong!</p>
<p>This explains the Kli Yakar is what Hashem is saying to klal Yisrael, Kmaasei Eretz Mitzrayimn asher yashavtem ba lo sa’asu DO NOT repeat the error of “settling-in” to the various societies where you will dwell as you did in Egypt. Indeed, it will only consume you. It will only foster more golus and even greater hester panim.</p>
<p>This mantra is as critical today as ever before. Blessed with much freedom, tolerance and bounty in the malchus shel chessed of America we can begin (hopefully not more so) to really feel at home and “settled-in” here. But as we commence the Seder with our table bedecked in all its regal finery, we must remember the true goal of the seder experience is geula – redemption. And that can can only be achieved if we our committed to ridding ourselves of the golus. The first step in the geula process is remembering the golus is still here. Golus is, despite the superficial appearance, dark, cold and lonely. Clarity of Hashem Yisborach’s reality is hidden. And if we, too, are “settled-in” we are part of the problem. Happily, we can provide the solution by not allowing ourselves to stay “settled-in.” In fact, if we but recognize the golus can ignite our passion for geula. This recognition is the driving force in fulfilling the requirement of chayav Adaam liros atzmo kielu hu yatza mimitzrayim! Yes, by “settling-in” no more and recognizing golus and how it has crept into our lives we can become worthy of being delivered from sivlos Mitzrayim – our tolerance of Egypt as we set our sights on true freedom of Torah and Mitzvos.</p>
<p>Yehi Ratzon, that we alert ourselves to the dangers of being “settled-in.”  In so doing may we merit to fully appreciate the smichas hapssukim – es mishpatay taasu ves chukosai tishmru laleches bahem … v’chay bahem! As we greet Mashiach tzidkeinu bimhara biyamenu amen.</p>

<h2>Parshas Metzorah<br />
The Mishkan Within</h2>
<p>As parshas Metzorah draws to a close we are reminded and warned of the importance of retaining our state of tahara as a people.</p>
<p>Following the myriad halchos of tumah and taharah which fill the parsha, we are told v’hizhartem es Bnei Yisrael mitumasom v’lo yamusu bitumasom bitamam es mishkani asher b’socham. This is a quite a critical posuk as various Tannaim and Amoraim throughout Shas darshan this verse for important halachos l’maasah. The many important halachic drashos derived from this posuk are accompanied by powerful aggadic drashos, as well. One such message is both inspiring and profound.<span id="more-4097"></span></p>
<p>The Sifrei expounds upon the words which conclude the posuk, bitamam es mishkani asher b’socham, and says; R’ Nosson omer: chavivim Yisrael sheb’chol makom shegalu Shechina imahem. Klal Yisrael is indeed special as the Shechina accompanies us when and wherever we go. Hashem’s love for us knows no bounds. This message is vital for our confidence and survival throughout the golus. Our continued existence depends on His love even when we do not fully deserve it. Boruch Hashem, He is with us throughout the trials and tribulations of the long and bitter exile.</p>
<p>But just where is He found?</p>
<p>As we scurry about the Diaspora, dispersed to the four corners of the earth, is there a place to find hope, sanctuary and salvation? Can we truly point to a particular repository of Shechina?</p>
<p>An insight form the Netziv says we can.</p>
<p>The Netziv teaches that at one level we should learn the words of the posuk literally. The phrase bitamam es mishkani asher b’socham, means to say &#8211; “haynu adam atzmo shehu mishkan laShechina!” Each Jew is a resting place for the Shechina in as much as we are a tzelem Elokim. Therefore the Shechina literally rests in us, not just in Eretz Yisrael, but wherever we are. Even b’tamam, when we mess up, Hakadosh Baruch Hu sticks with us. He clings to our neshama keeping the pintele Yid lit in every one of His children.</p>
<p>It is this profound element which makes us so special and dear. But it also carries with it responsibility. We need to be able to draw inspiration from introspection. We must be willing to open our eyes to feel His hashgacha pratis governing our lives and reach for the connection our inner soul naturally seeks with our Creator. If we but reflect upon all His goodness and our spiritual endurance, despite millennia of exile, we can tap into the power of the mishkan within and feel ourselves home to all of His glory. Even more, perhaps the Netziv is telling us that the building of the mikdash begins inside us all. With Pesach just around the corner there is no better time than the present to start.</p>

<h2>Parshas Shemini<br />
Tovim Hashnayim Min Ha’Echad</h2>
<p>The Parsha commences with the celebration of Aharon and his sons as they ascend into the role of Kohanim for the very first time. Prepared, trained and ready to serve, they offer their first sacrifices filled with excitement and pride. While still atop the Mizbeach, The Posuk says vayisa Aharon es yadav — “Aharon Hakohein lifted up his hands to bless Klal Yisrael”. Filled with excitement and joy he turns toward Bnai Yisrael and blesses them with the words of Birchas Kohanim for the very first time. The climax of this monumental moment was to be when a heavenly fire would ignite the Mizbeach to offer an awesome revelation of the Shechina to all. But as Aharon completed the Bracha, all was  silent. Nothing happens.</p>
<p>Rashi explains how Aharon, stunned with disappointment, turned to his brother Moshe and lamented his “unworthiness” to serve. <span id="more-3967"></span>Moshe reassured him and together they approached the Ohel Moed. Inside they offered private prayers. Then, together, the Posuk says, vayeitzu vayivarchu es ha’am — “they went forth and blessed Klal Yisrael”. Immediately the Torah proclaims vayeireh kvod Hashem el kol ha’am— The Shechina was revealed for all to see. What changed to enable the success of this revelation?</p>
<p>&#8216;The Midrash itself provides us a clue. Says the Midrash, this episode is an example of tovim hashnayim min ha’echad — “two are better than one.” It is a reflection of  Heinei mah tov umah naim sheves achim gam yachad. Why?</p>
<p>A fundamental maxim of dedicating the Mishkan, is the knowledge that all Jews are interdependent. A Jew is never alone. Moreover, we can never look at ourselves as being complete. We have to continue to learn and to grow from one another other. When Jews function B’achva there is nothing that cannot be accomplished. This is the underlying message of the Chanukas Hamishkan. Aharon Hakohein was the conduit to provide this vivid reminder for us all. Indeed, we must always remember to not “go it alone”. We can take this lesson with us today as we consecrate the Mikdash Me’at of our home, shul or school. With the new month of geula, Nissan, upon the horizon, our sense of Achva must guide us. The number “one” is reserved for Hashem Yisborach alone. Only with the power of 2 can we fully connect to the Shney Luchos Habrius – and IY”H excel bein adam laMakom ubein adam lachaveiro to build the Beis Hamikdash anew, bimhara biyameinu Amen.</p>

<h2>Purim<br />
A Time To Know</h2>
<p>The notorious antagonist of the Purim saga is none other than the Amalekite, Haman. Chazal wonder, where can we find a hint to the existence of Haman and his nefarious plan to annihilate the Jewish people? They teach us that the phrase in Parshas Bereishis which describes Hashem Yisborach confronting Adam Harishon regarding the sin of eating from the Etz Hada’as, “Hamin haetz asher tzivisicha l’vilti achol mimenu achalta” is a remez to Haman. The word hamin and Haman have identical Hebrew letters. This needs further clarification. What does eating of the Etz Hada’as have to do with the Purim story at all? Moreover, there is an additional Medrash which says that the tree on which Haman was hanged was also the Etz Hada’as. How could the same tree be both the remez to the plot of Haman and be as well, the symbol of his ultimate downfall? To understand this further, we must shed some light on the essence of Amalek and his impact on Klal Yisrael.<span id="more-3932"></span></p>
<p>The Baal Haturim points out that the word Amalek shares the same gematria as the word safek. He teaches us, that it is Amalek who plants the seeds of doubt regarding our emunah, our connection to Hashem, and our responsibilities to behave as an am segula. Haman fostered and capitalized on these doubts by advising King Achashveirosh to invite the Jews to his feast. These doubts which epitomize the power of Amalek to separate us from the Shechina are actually rooted in the very first sin.</p>
<p>Before eating from the Etz Hada’as, Adam and Chava had clarity. They knew Hashem Yisborach. In the utopian world of Gan Eden, they were able to focus totally on the spiritual. Indeed, they never even noticed their own need for clothes. Their physical world was insignificant and they enjoyed the spiritual nirvana that was Gan Eden. However, upon eating from the Etz Hada’as, doubts crossed that reality. They were ashamed. Suddenly, that clarity of spiritual perspective was now clouded with shades of insecurity and disbelief that corrupts are hearts and minds till this very day.</p>
<p>This power to instill doubt, even among the faithful, is the secret weapon used by Amelek in his attempt to destroy the Jewish people and their belief in Hashem. It was Haman’s tool as well. Like his antecedent, Amalek, Haman used its corrupting power rooted in the first sin in Garden of Eden in his attempt to annihilate us all.</p>
<p>What was the response then and what should it be today? While it is true that the eye opening knowledge introduced to the world through the eating of the Etz Hada’as brought about safek, we also know that the only process to eradicate doubt is to acquire knowledge. The megilla tells us,  “v’Mordechai yada es kol asher na’asa-” Mordechai knew what was happening and he used this power of knowledge to eradicate Klal Yisrael’s doubts of their nitzchiyus and their relationship with the Ribbono Shel Olam. True, seventy years of golus had just about passed, but netzach Yisroel lo Yishaker, the geula would come. Klal Yisrael could and would continue their sacred mission as yodei Hashem, making His presence known to all of civilization. The antidote to Amalek, the cure to absorbing the insecurities presented by the Etz Hada’as is to become a stronger yodea, a more knowledgeable Jew. As Klal Yisrael, strengthened their yedia of Hashem and His Torah through tefilla and kabbalas Hatorah as described in the Megilla, they fashioned the weapon that would lead to Haman’s demise.</p>
<p>It is no different today. Purim is a time to know. The more we know, the better we learn and the more we live with the maxim of haphach bah v’haphich bo d’kula ba, the better we can eradicate Amalek and the dispersions he casts up our emunah still today. Yes, Haman was hung on the Etz Hada’as, not the dangerous small bits of knowledge that breed doubt, but the surety of knowledge which yields competence and confidence, a confidence so strong, we can reach the level of ad d’lo yada and still know what’s right and wrong with all our heart and soul.</p>
<p>Chag Purim Sameach</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Parshas Vayikra<br />
Exceeding the Angels</h2>
<p>Vayikrah el Moshe, with Hashem Yisborach calling out to Moshe Rabbeinu, we commence the study of Toras Kohanim. With an expression of chibah, the sefer begins with the avodas hakarbonos, the laws of sacrifice, the embodiment of the mesiras nefesh each Yid should have for his or her own personal avodas Hashem.</p>
<p>Chazal derive many vital yesodos from the very opening of the parsha. They note the verb phrases that commence the parsha (vayikrah el Moshe and daber el Bnei Yisrael) and they point out the obvious; Moshe Rabbeinu was not only spoken to by the Ribbono Shel Olam, but he was expected to speak out and transmit a message to Klal Yisrael. As a result, the Yalkut Shimoni exclaims; “gedolim tzaddikim yoser mimalachei hashareis shehamalachim einom yicholim lishmoah kolo . . . v’hatzadikkim yicholim lishmoah el kolo!” This, explains the Yalkut, is the personification of the posuk, giborei koach oseh d’varo lishmoah b’kol dvaro.</p>
<p>This aggada is difficult to fully comprehend. Could it be that tzaddikim are truly greater than the malachim who live in the upper spiritual realms? Is it not the malachim whom we echo in our proclamation of Kedusha each day? And is it true that the malachim do not hear Hashem Yisborach? How then, are they to follow His commands or transmit to us secrets heard machrei hapargud? What is the lesson Chazal are offering?<span id="more-3897"></span></p>
<p>The answer lies in realizing that that the essence of hearing is not in what one takes in, but in what he puts forth as a result. Malachim can only listen to Hashem Yisborach. With trepidation and awe, they do exactly as He wills. People also hear a message, but it is up to them to react and perform accordingly. Too often, individuals “hear” the message but, sadly, refuse to answer the call. Sometimes it is laziness. Other times, it is inconvenience. Though we may know what spiritual demands and standards are expected, our “humanity” gets in the way. We refuse lishmoah &#8211; to hearken to His will. We carry on no differently than before as we stubbornly neglect the writing written so brightly on the wall.</p>
<p>Tzaddikim, however, not only hear the message, but they respond to its impact. They listen to the summons from on High and rally their heart and soul to make a difference for themselves and the klal. They make the message personal as they create goals and ambitions for self improvement, spiritual advancement and refinement of character in their learning and kiyum hamitzvos. They seek avenues to help others connect spiritually as they inspire gadlus and advance the reality of the Ribbono Shel Olam in all of their endeavors. They heed the call and spread the message. It is a job which only Klal Yisrael can do and the malachim can not. It should be the ultimate by-product of our mesiras nefesh for Torah and all He expects from us. Lishmoah, and as a result, lilmod, ulilameid, lishmor, v’laasos ulikayeim es kol divrei Torasecha b’ahava!</p>
<p>This notion of “getting it” is a fundamental aspect of the avodas hakorbanos. It is not enough to offer an animal on the mizbeiyach. Rather, an emotional sense of this sacrifice being bimokomi &#8211; in place of me, is required for the message of the korban to hit home. The ensuing kaparah is manifest in our changing our lives for the better and learning to make it right for the future. True, the malachim are privileged to enjoy clarity and proximity to kaviyachol, the Ribbonon Shel Olam, by just doing His will. But, they can do no more and no less. However, we must constantly remember, gedolim tzaddikim yoser mimalachei hashareis. We can surpass the angels. Through our power of choice in clearly hearing (and reacting to) His words, doing His will, and making the difference He desires of us, we can, and indeed, exceed them all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/stemple2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3894" title="Second Temple" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/stemple2-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>Vayikra begins with the korbanos (temple sacrifices / offerings). This week’s parsha goes into detail, teaching us how to successfully perform many of the typical korbanos brought in the Mishkan. A korban could be brought for many different reasons. Some were brought automatically each and every day. Others were brought in gratitude. Others were special korbanos for special occasions like holidays.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most perplexing korban to our modern sensibilities is the sin offering. How is it that sending an animal to slaughter can offer forgiveness for sin? Wouldn’t we expect the process of achieving atonement takes more than the death of an animal?</p>
<p>The Talmud in Brachos (17a) may offer a bit of perspective.<span id="more-3892"></span></p>
<p>Now that we have no more korbanos how are we to achieve the level of forgiveness that was previously attained by the sin offering? The Talmud relates that when Rav Sheshes (4th century amora / Talmudic scholar) fasted added a supplication to his Amida (silent prayer recited while standing): “Master of the Universe, You know that when the Temple was standing, if a man sinned he used to bring a sacrifice, and though all that was offered of it was its fat and blood, atonement was made for him. Now I have fasted and my fat and blood have diminished. May it be Your will to consider my fat and blood which have been diminished as if I had offered them before You on the altar, and I should be desirable to You.”</p>
<p>Rav Sheshes is teaching us that the secret of korbanos is that they represent the sinner on the altar. A fast is the best we can do to reenact the feeling of watching something burn in one’s place. That experience must be more moving than a fast. Rav Sheshes pined for the true experience of participating in korbanos. When one brought a korban it was to inspire them. When one saw the blood and fats of the animal that they had brought to the Temple burning on the altar they were to feel as if their blood and fats were vicariously burning on the Altar.</p>
<p>We are left to wonder why someone would bring a korban  at all when they could simply fast!? Further, why is the focus on the blood and fats?</p>
<p>Rav Kook says that there are two primary reasons people sin. One is due to overindulgence in physical or sensual pleasure. The yearning for luxury and getting above the hard realities of existence. These sins are atoned for by the burning of the fats. The second kind of sin is a result of basic need. Some people sin because it seems like they need to. They are poor or hungry. They are under tremendous pressure and sin as a result. These sins are atoned for by the burning of the blood.</p>
<p>When we fast, we relive the humbling experience of seeing the blood and fats burn on the altar. I am sure, that watching it was contributive to one’s strength to withstand temptation. When it occurs in the Temple, there is a precision to the process. Only the blood and fats are burned sending the perfect message to the sinner. However, when we fast, our entire bodies become depleted. It’s not just our blood and fats that are being offered. Fasting can negatively one’s entire body. It weakens us and our ability to perform mitzvos and study Torah. It has side effects that make it a dangerous way to achieve forgiveness. Korbanos are much more efficient.</p>
<p>This idea is powerful in the reverse as well. If we use our “blood and fats” in our performance of mitzvos and Torah study we will avoid the need for korbanos and fasting. Using our passions and pressure to improve our lives and the lives of others is taking the lesson of korbanos to the opposite extreme.</p>
<p>Here at PJC we are committed to passionate Judaism. That is the kind of Judaism that is represented by blood and fats. Let us use Vayikra as a wonderful source of inspiration for activating it.</p>

<h2>Parshas Pikudei<br />
The Mikdash Shel Maalah</h2>
<p>As we conclude sefer Shmos we are provided with a full accounting of the donations to the Mishkan. Moshe Rabbeinu answers the call of his critics who wondered whether or not he was truly an honest leader. A full accounting is provided. (It is a model of economic transparency which Klal Yisrael should still strive for today.)<span id="more-3876"></span></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Moshe Rabbeinu’s din v’cheshbon vis a vis the funds contributed to the Mishkan provide the backdrop of the actual hakomas hamishkan for the very first time. We are being taught that in order for the Mishkan to be a repository for the Shechina the very construction itself must meet the test of financial integrity. What a lesson in and of itself. Chazal, however, draw another fantastic yesod from this context.</p>
<p>The Posuk (40:18) declares vayakem Moshe es hamishkan, Moshe Rabaeinu erected the Mishkan. The Baal Haturim wonders, why is the word HaMishkan presented with the hey hayideah?  He quotes the psikata which teaches that the letter hey of Hamishkan is coming to include the Mikdash shel Maalah. We are being taught that at that same moment that Moshe Rabbeinu erected the Mishkan in this world, Hashem Yisborach commanded the malachim to build the Mishkan Shel Maalah.</p>
<p>Our efforts in this world are rewarded middah kineged middah in the olam ha’emes. What we build down below is established in a mirror universe on high. Indeed the Mishkan Shel Maalah is a reflection of our efforts on this world. KlalYisrael’s collective efforts, devotion and commitment are rewarded not just for us to enjoy in olam hazaeh, rather they create a reality in the Olam haElyon as well. This is not only true of the construction of the Mishkan but it is the mitzius for each and every mitzvah we perform.</p>
<p>There is more. The Psikta a few verses earlier (39:33) expounds on the words vayavi’ooh es hamishkan, they delivered the Mishakan. It states that the hey hayideah in that verse has an additional ribui, according to the Psikta it is to included brias shamayim vaaretz! The powerful message is clear. What we do on this world creates the reality we enjoy on heaven and earth. Do well and mitzvah goreres mitzvah &#8211; we are rewarded with opportunities for more mitzvos with which to earn the schar of Olam Habah as we spread ruchniyus in this world. Of course, r”l, the opposite is also true. Vayaveuh es Hamishkan our personal olam habah is the reflection of the spiritual accomplishments we deliver to the Kisay haKavod following our sojourn in this ephemeral world. We define our world then as well as now.</p>
<p>As we conclude sefer Shmos there is no more important lesson. The creation of these two worlds is in our hands. The backdrop of accountability is now clear. The kiyum of our world and the structure of the olmei olamim is our opportunity and responsibility. What we do matters. It is up to us to build well in this world so that the Ribbono Shel Olam will build for us our personal and communal mikdash of splendor in the world to come. Where we arrive, b’chol maasehem – in all of our journeys, in this world and the next, is ultimately the product of the mitzvos and maasim tovim we do each day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<address><span style="color: #888888;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/line-graph.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3849" title="line graph" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/line-graph-300x166.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="166" /></a>A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayakhel<br />
Tein L’chacham Viyechkam Od</h2>
<p>As we learn of the construction phase of the Mishkan, the Torah describes  the artisans and craftsmen who fashioned the Mishkan as “kol ish chacham lev asher nasan Hashem chachma usivunah baheima—the wise hearted individuals in whom Hashem planted wisdom and understanding.” Chazal associate this posuk with a verse from Mishlei (9:9) tein l’chacham viyechkam od to derive an interesting lesson. The Torah, we know, is teaching us that it was the wise men to whom Hashem gave wisdom and understanding.</p>
<p>Chazal  wonder, The wise are already smart. Why didn’t Hashem give this bonus of extra wisdom to the feeble minded and the untalented? Shouldn’t Hashem give the gift of chachmah and tvunah to those who really need it?<span id="more-3847"></span></p>
<p>They answer with a moshal (adapted to contemporary times). With whom do people invest their assets? With the successful or the unsuccessful businessman? Surely the poor, “wannabe” entrepreneur struggling to make ends meet needs the infusion of capital far more than the very successful Wall Street investment banker. Yet nonetheless, we give our trust, confidence and checkbook to those who we feel have a track record of a solid return on our investment. We want to give our money to those who know how to grow our hard earned dollar. Says the Midrash, the same is true with Divine wisdom. Hashem grants it to those He knows will use it well. Hashem’s chachma and tvunah are only imparted to those in whom He has confidence will generate a healthy return on His investment. Thus only the chachmei lev—those who already demonstrated their intelligent application of wisdom were endowed with more to fashion the Mishkan. The wise were gifted with even more wisdom. These were the individuals who were nosei libom likarvah el hamilacha lasaos osah. They were motivated and had proven themselves to be committed to fulfilling the ratzon Hashem.</p>
<p>This idea of blessing those who have what they need with more of what they already have is not new. This lesson was first taught to us by Yaakov Avinu when he blessed his grandchildren. We are taught that Menashe was the businessman who managed Yosef Hatzadik’s affairs as viceroy to Pharoah. Ephraim, on the other hand was a great talmid chacham who modeled the lesson of his grandfather as an ish tam yosheiv ohalaim. Orech yamim biyiminam ubsimolam osher v’chavod, the right side is the represents the spiritual domain the left the more material. Yosef placed his sons in front of their grandfather so that Menashe would be opposite Yaakov’s right hand. Ephraim stood in front of Yaakov’s left hand. Yosef determined that Ephraim, the talmid chacham, needed help, with his gashmi affairs afterall he was always learnig what did he know of this world. Menashe the businessman needed an extra infusion of ruchniyos to provide him chizuk. Instead however, Yaakov seekeil es yadav, he made his hands “smart.” Indeed he crossed his hands so that his right was on Ephraim and the his left was on Menashe. Yaakov Avinu understood and taught us that we have to maximize the potential we have been given and not try to be something we are not. Ephraim the talmid chacham should shteig even higher. Menashe should have even more success in his business endeavors. As long as one is fulfilling his tafkid he is in good shape. This is a lesson we must constantly remember as we guide and nurture and our own children. They will excel in the areas they are destined to enjoy. We should note those strengths and build on them as Shlomo Hamelechg said &#8211; tein l’chacham viyechkam od.</p>
<p>This is an important reminder for us all.  Hashem has endowed each individual with a unique combination of talents and abilities. They have been invested with us la’sos es kol mileches avodas hakodesh lchal asher tziva Hashem, to perform His will with the special combination of talent and personality that defines our individual uniqueness. His confidence in our ability to earn Him a substantial return on that investment is what defines our challenge for life. If we simply follow the lead of Betzalel, Ahaleiav and their associates we, too, can be crowned as chachmei lev and bring the return His trust in us is intended to yield from all that we do, iy”H.</p>

<h2>Parshas Ki Sisa<br />
Lo Yamush Sefer HaTorah HaZeh MiPicha</h2>
<p>As parents we often wonder if we are “getting it right.” We worry about the future. How will our children grow up? What will their commitment to Torah and Mitzvos be like? Can we assure that the values we treasure so dearly will be transmitted effectively from generation to generation? This week’s Parsha says we can. The formula is profound yet simple.<span id="more-3788"></span></p>
<p>As Moshe Rabbeinu reacts to the sin of the Golden Calf, he negotiates, Kivayachol, with Hashem Yisborach to spare Klal Yisrael from divine retribution. This dialogue takes place “Panim el Panim” in the Ohel Moed—the tent of meeting about which we are told, almost as an aside, “Um’sharso Yehoshua Bin Nun na’ar lo yamish mitoch haohel” -his (Moshe’s) student Yehoshua never moved from the Ohel. Yehoshua&#8217;s devotion to Torah learning and his commitment to serve his Rebbi, Moshe Rabeinu, was his entire preoccupation. It was what defined his ascent to becoming the leader of Bnai Yirael in the future.</p>
<p>The Gemarah associates this pasuk with a similar verse in Sefer Yehoshua where the Navi says: Lo yamush sefer hatorah hazeh mipicha. The Gemara states that this verse is not an obligation, nor a commandment, but rather a blessing. It is, the Navi records, Hashem&#8217;s reward and response for Yehoshua&#8217;s dedication. As Chazal say: Hashem saw (from the words in this week’s parsha) that the Torah was so precious and dear to Yehoshua, that He blessed him, saying: &#8220;If the words of Torah are so precious to you, then I bless you with the assurance of knowing they will never be removed from you.” Moreover, the Navi Yeshaya adds, it is not only a promise to you but a commitment that the Torah will not be withdrawn “Mipicha, u’mipi zaracha  umipi zerah zaracha”  &#8211; not from you, your children or grandchildren.</p>
<p>This is a dramatic reminder for parents. Hashem&#8217;s recognition of what we do for Him is so grand and humbling that it not only benefits  us, but generations to come, as well. Children are blessed to live what they have learned at home. Parents are the most influential teachers. If the words of Torah are precious to us they will IY”H be precious to our children. If we nurture our children with a lifestyle of true Yiddishkeit in our home, that legacy will IY”H extend well beyond our lifetimes.</p>

<h2>Parshas Yisro<br />
Royalty!</h2>
<p>The revelation at Sinai is the quintessential Chinuch experience. On Har Choreiv, Torah was taught to Klal Yisrael for the very first time. The instructor was none other than Hashem Yisborach Himself. There is much we can learn from Matan Torah in terms of the recipe needed for effective instruction. Examining the “Chinuch paradigm” inherent in the experience of Matan Torah we see that it is filled with structured, relevant, individualized content, powerful audio-visual aids, and unique special effects all of which motivated and inspired the active participation of all the talmidim. What a powerful model for teaching and transmitting our mesorah. However, we must look even more closely at the Sinaitic experience for an important ingredient that is sometimes overlooked in our understanding of Matan Torah. It is so relevant today.<span id="more-3665"></span></p>
<p>Before presenting the Aseres Hadibros, Hakadosh Baruch Hu tells Moshe Rabbeinu to stress to Klal Yisrael V’atem ti’hiyu li mamleches kohanim v’goy kadosh, “You, Klal Yisrael, are to be My chosen people and holy nation.” Interestingly, this is Klal Yisrael’s introduction to Matan Torah. As Hashem is about to give us His most precious treasure, the very gift which defines us as a people, it is not the sanctity of Torah, Yesodos of Emunah, nor Mitzvos or even Middos that He emphasizes but rather it is attitude.<br />
We are being shown that in order for the Torah to take root, we have to be aware of our potential. We can be a noble, chosen people. Indeed, we need to know who we are and what we can be! Seeing that it sets the tone for Kabbalas HaTorah, transmitting this awareness must become the highest priority in every educational setting. It is important in every classroom, be it the lessons taught at school or those modeled at home.</p>
<p>We all play a vital role in the development of this positive Torah attitude in our children, be it our own offspring or the tinokos shenishbu we encounter and hope to be mikareiv to our Father in heaven. The tone is set by our attitude toward the Chinuch activities that fill our lives daily (just about everything we do!) From “Parsha Time” at the Shabbos table to the alacrity and enthusiasm placed in Talmud Torah and mitzvah observance in our homes or in the public eye, we are the instructors and what we do matters.</p>
<p>Hakadosh Baruch Hu, kiviyachol, showed us a model at Sinai. When we help our children see themselves as a part of dynasty of kohanim we can hope to have the Siyata D’Shamya to rear them into a goy kadosh – a holy nation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/shutterstock_roller_coaster.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3650" title="shutterstock_roller_coaster" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/shutterstock_roller_coaster-300x155.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="158" /></a>Parshas Beshalach is a roller coaster. Each time the Israelites are saved from a dire situation a new challenge immediately crops up. They escape Egypt. But the Egyptian army is in hot pursuit. The Sea opens for them to cross. But the Egpytians follow. The Egyptians are killed in the crashing waters. But the Israelite have nothing to eat. The entire parsha follows this format.</p>
<p>Beware, it is not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>Some of the Israelites’ problems were in their own minds and were of their own doing. They had a complaining problem. They complained a lot.<span id="more-3647"></span> Before they were saved at the sea, they exclaimed “are there no graves in Egypt that you had to bring us to the desert so that we should die?!” After they were saved they had no water to drink, so they complained. Once their thirst was quenched, they were hungry. They kvetched to Moshe and Aharon, pining for the fleshpots of Egypt. Throughout the parsha there are even more examples of seemingly immature, shortsighted complaints.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most egregious of these complaints found in the Torah was the response of the Israelites to the manna. The manna was food from heaven that tasted delicious. It was truly a perfect food. Somehow the Israelites found fault in the manna as well. Rashi, in the Book of Numbers (11:7) tells us that despite its perfection, the Israelites managed to complain about the manna.</p>
<p>The Midrash mentions an even more absurd complaint lodged by the Israelites. A verse in Psalms (106:7) implies that there were two rebellions just before the sea split. The first rebellion was that no one was willing to trek into the water until the water split following the lead of the leaders of the tribe of Judah.  The second rebellion was when the Israelites complained about the muddy terrain they traversed as they crossed the Sea of Reeds.</p>
<p>They complained that the ground was muddy! It boggles the mind. How could someone whose life is being saved have the audacity to complain about the muddy ground?! Obviously it was muddy! Where water meets earth, there is mud! As they are experiencing the miracle upon which we base our relationship with God, they are complaining that their feet are getting muddy. Incredible! What is the explanation for this?</p>
<p>The Kotzker Rebbe tells us the answer. When the Israelites complained about the bitter water, the Torah tells us: “They came to Marah, but they could not drink the waters of Marah because they [the waters] were bitter, (ki marim hem). Therefore they named it Marah” (15:23). The Kotzker says that the words ki marim hem, “because they were bitter”, may refer to the people and not the water. Rendering the verse, “because the people were bitter”. They were broken from years of slavery and they were bitter. They complained about everything. But their complaints were not because they had legitimate gripes. They did not. They complained because they were bitter and bitter people complain even when they have nothing about which to complain.</p>
<p>Optimism is important. We cannot allow ourselves to “become bitter”. It’s uncomfortable for others around us and it makes it difficult for us to enjoy life. We have so much  for which to be thankful. We need to look at the world though the lens of hope and positivity and not the lens of bitterness.</p>
<p>The Israelites in the desert were rescued from the most difficult of situations. They were slaves whose lives were made so bitter that we remember their bitter lives with maror at our Pesach Seder every year. And then they were saved. We live a charmed life by comparison. Let’s enjoy it. Let’s try to banish bitterness from our lives. If we are positive and optimistic we will live a life we are proud to share with others.</p>

<h2>Parshas B’shalach<br />
“Heavenly Bread”</h2>
<p>After Krias Yam Suf, Hashem Yisborach responds to Klal Yisrael’s complaints for food by delivering them the mon. As a part of the process, He communicates to Moshe Rabbeinu what is to be an eternal lesson. The miracle of the mon was a six day per week experience. Rather than provide a bushel full of food to last for weeks, Hashem instructs v’laktu d’var yom b’yomo — Bnai Yisrael should gather (food) each day. This requirement is necessary, the posuk explains, l’maan annasenu hayeilech b’Torasi im lo — to test Klal Yisrael if they will follow the Torah or not.” Why, we may ask, the need of a test? Secondly, how is it connected to the mon? Finally it seems that this test is measuring emunah, why is it described in terms of hayeilech b’torasi  — following the Torah?<span id="more-3643"></span></p>
<p>The Mifarshim derive a powerful message from here. The most powerful measure of our commitment to Torah is found in our pursuit of parnassah — earning a livelihood. Too often, when it comes to the workplace, people make compromises in the standards Hashem demands from us in the Torah. It is as if they feel r”l that Hashem is unaware. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are reminded v’laktu d’var yom b’yomo lma’aan annasenu We must measure up to earn our keep every day. Even before Matan Torah, netzach Yisrael was being built on this maxim. The mon was distributed by Hashem and collected by the individual daily. Its flavor was determined by the values and taste of the recipient. And the amount of mon  which was delivered and the effort needed to collect it was a reflection of the quality of hayeilech b’Torasi as measured by the mitzvos and maasim tovim performed by the individual the previous day. This reinforced a constant dependence on Hashem. It can help keep us motivated to be ever vigilant in “following the Torah” through our Mitzvah observance, and personification of middos tovos in the work place.</p>
<p>At the revelation at Sinai described in next week’s parsha, Hashem gifted us with the tools needed to reach the loftiest realms of kedusha. Mon, the Heavenly bread, teaches us that through the seemingly mundane earthly process of earning a living we must feel His presence. In so doing we can IY”H merit His presents; brachos of parnassah, life, health and Nachas from our children, ad meah v’esrim shana.</p>

<h2>Parshas Bo<br />
This is it!</h2>
<p>Hachodesh hazeh lachem rosh chadashim. As the birth of Klal Yisrael unfolds, Hashem Yisborach presents us with our first national mitzvah, Kiddush Hachodesh. The Midrashim tell us that the calculations for proclaiming the new month were so complicated that Moshe Rabbeinu found them difficult. Finally, after struggling to comprehend all the astronomical details, Moshe Rabbeinu is provided clarity. Indeed, Chazal teach us that we learn from the word “hazeh” that Hakadosh Baruch Hu Kivayachol pointed to the moon and said to Moshe Rabbeinu “this is the new moon and its position in the sky.”</p>
<p>It is curious that Moshe “struggled” with the technical details of the lunar placement upon the horizon. Is it really more complicated than other complicated halachos?<span id="more-3615"></span> Moreover, it was not Moshe’s only “struggle.” Chazal point to four specific Mitzvos that presented a similar challenge and each is clarified with the expression of zeh—“this” is how it should be. In addition to the mitzvah of Kiddush Hachodesh, the topics are; the the intricate design of the Menorah, the description of the Machatzis Hashekel and the defining traits of a kosher animal. What is the common denominator that links these items? Furthermore, could it really be that these four concepts were so difficult for Moshe Rabbeinu, the one who spoke face to face with Hashem Yisborach? What is the message being taught?</p>
<p>In reality, Moshe was not personally challenged by these four concepts. But as the Rabban Shel Yisrael he was troubled for us and for our future. We know that these four topics represent the greatest challenge to us all, they represent: time, wisdom, gashmiyus and money. We wonder how to use and not abuse them. And we struggle. How to use the gift of time to maximize its potential and our pride in so doing? What to do with the wisdom that one has acquired and where to focus individual strengths and interests toward future growth? In relating to the olam hagashmi we seek to discern how to differentiate between satisfaction and indulgence? Finally, in regard to money, how to establish priorities that will yield the greatest, truest returns?</p>
<p>For each nisayon we are guided with a focused response of “Hazeh,” Hashem delineating the appropriate perspective for us to live by. By Hashem symbolically “pointing” to the new moon (time), the Menora (wisdom), kosher animal’s traits (physical world) and the half shekel (money), He points us away from the spiritual obstacles inherent in each and towards the spiritual pursuits for which we should strive. Then and as now, time is to be sanctified, each hour and minute to be used purposefully in avodas Hashem. Knowledge is to be shared, helping ignite and foster yedias Hashem in others. The physical world is to be harnessed with self-discipline to bring Kedusha to otherwise physical pursuits. And money offers us the opportunity to invest in His work.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge of existence is to successfully blend the pure Neshama we’ve been given with the material traits of humanity. Buffeted by four winds of turmoil our avodah is constantly put to the test. Moshe Rabbeinu is concerned and seeks guidance for his people l’dorei doros. Hashem Yisborah responds “zeh – this” is just what we need.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayechi<br />
Tov Ayin Hu Yivorach</h2>
<p>Shlomo Hamelech proclaims tov ayin hu yivorach, those with a “good eye” are blessed. This verse in Mishlei is closely associated with the Mishna in Avos which teaches us the chosheiuvus of an ayin tova in our avodas Hashem. At a deeper level,  Chazal relate this posuk to Yosef hatzaddik. They teach us that the offspring of Yosef Hatzaddik suffer not from the dreaded impact of the ayin hara. Indeed, this was part of the bracha Yaakov Avinu gave to Yosef’s sons as he proclaimed to them (and for us) v’yidgu l’rov b’kerev haaretz.<span id="more-3489"></span></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Yaakov Avinu chose to repeat this blessing to Yosef as he blessed all of his children just before he died. The pasuk states, ben porat Yosef ben porat alay ayin. Chazal darshan these words, too, as the gift of protection form the ill effects of ayin harah. Duplicate messages in Torah have a purpose. Obviously, being shielded from ayin harah is not meant to be a mere personal bracha for Yosef and his children. Rather it is a defining attribute with which the satano shel Eisav can help his children vanquish their pernicious adversary and ready themselves for the ultimate geula. How so?</p>
<p>The gemara in masechas Brachos expands on this drasha. According to one amora, the reason that Yosef Hatzaddik was protected from the ayin hara was because ayin shelo ratzta lazun memah she’ano sh’lo, ein ayin hara sholetes bo. The eye of that individual (Yosef) who did not want to take and use that which was not his is safeguarded from the impact of the ayin hara. In other words, we learn from Yosef that not taking things from others is enough of a reason to prevent the ill-will of others from creating a negative karma, which would be hurtful to another.</p>
<p>This yesod should not be lost upon us. Each of us is blessed with so much and must appreciate G-d’s blessings, and use them for good. If we covet not the assets of others, we will be blessed with good fortune, as our ayin tova is mirrored by an ayin tova from others. If r”l we take advantage of others and take that which is not ours then we leave porselves vulnerable to tragic consequences. This is a most meaningful and profound message. We must be appreciative of what we have, maximize our gifts and not take advantage of that which is not ours.</p>
<p>At a superficial level we might think this attitude is enough to become a charter member of the “ayin harah-free” family of Yosef Hatzadik.  However, the Zohar offers a deeper yesod which teaches us that the Gemarah in Brachos is only the initial stride in a two step process with which to become a modern day Yosef as it assures that we can create an ayin hara-less society. The Zohar explains that the reason Yosef was blessed with protection from the ayin hara is not because he did not want to benefit from that which was not his, rather it was because he took that which rightfully was his and gave it to others in need. Yosef’s projected his own extraordinary ayin tova on others. He strives to be helpful and supportive of the indigent and needy. He created a safety net for them and their families and as a result of his profound and generous ayin tova he was gifted that the ayin harah of others will not hurt him. Toras haniglah says that to be spared from the ayin hara you merely should not covet the property of others, the Toras hanistar teaches us that to achieve the lofty realm of tov ayin hu yivorach it is not enough to avoid using the assets of others but rather must one give of their own possessions to those in need.</p>
<p>Yosef lived the mantra of the Mishna in Avos that says haomer shli shelach v’shelach shelach chasid. As such, the aying hara had no shlita over him, his ayin tova protected him. And it protects us too. No one should be afraid of giving tzedakah or lending a hand to others out of fear of ayin hahrah. Adirabbah, tov ayin hu yivorach &#8211; the more we reach out with generosity and beneficence the more we are blessed.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Just Visiting</h2>
<p>The drama of the Parsha seems to reach its climax with Yosef’s revelation to his brothers. In reality, however, a message much more profound than the discovery of Yosef’s identity is being conveyed to us for eternity.</p>
<p>The inner lesson of Parshas Vayigash is Bnai Yisrael’s descent into Golus. Golus is not only about location; it is about a mindset. It is not only about where we are now, but where we are heading.</p>
<p>Avraham Avinu was told at the Bris Bein Habisarim, that his grandchildren would be strangers in a strange land. Unfortunately, as the Torah tells us at the end of the Parsha, “Vayeishvu Bnai Yisrael—Bnai Yisrael settled into Egypt”. Not content with being “strangers”, they made Mitzrayim home.<span id="more-3448"></span> They became active citizens of Egypt. Indeed, as the Bnai Yaakov took up residence in the land of Goshen they took it all in. They blended with the prevalent culture and adapted to the mores of Egyptian civilization. As they grew from an immigrant population of a mere seventy households they adopted Egyptian customs and made them their own. Their homes became indistinguishable in some ways from their Egyptian counterparts. They were living the “Egyptian dream”. As a result, Klal Yisrael suffered through the shibud Mitzrayim  (the bondage of Mitzrayim) instead of passing through it with relative ease. Despite the efforts of Yaakov Avinu, who charged Yehuda with the mission of establishing a Yeshiva and a building a Torah communal infrastructure, the Golus came fast and easy. Why? The answer, the Kli Yakar explains, is found in the last posuk of the Parsha where we are told that not only did Klal Yisrael settle into Egypt— vayeiachzu bah!  they took hold of it with gusto.</p>
<p>This is a valuable reminder to us. Chazal tell us that the geula ha’asida, the final redemption, will parallel the Geulas Mitzrayim. We need to work on redefining our status to be sure we conduct ourselves as mere visitors by keeping the current Golus out of our heart and out of our home. Then we and our families will IY”H pass through the Malchus shel Chesed called “America” intact. Indeed, Mashiach awaits us. We need to be ready for his call.</p>

<h2>Parshas Mikeitz</h2>
<h2>The Power of Prayer</h2>
<p>Parshas Mikeitz is chock full of vital yesodos for the ages. From the rags to riches saga of Yosef Hatzadik’s ascent to power as the viceroy of Egypt to the ten tribes search for their long lost brother, inspiring details of Hashgacha Pratis unfold before our eyes. So many deep lessons jump off the pages of our Chumashim that some of the subtle insights can get lost. One such message is found in the dialogue between Yaakov Avinu and Yehuda, as Yehuda implores Yaakov Avinu to entrust his youngest brother, Binyomin, to his care so that they can get food in Egypt.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yaakov Avinu was frightfully worried about what would befall Binyomin.<span id="more-3405"></span> He saw the prospects as alarmingly bleak. Indeed, Yosef was gone and Shimon, if alive, was languishing in a dungeon somewhere in Egypt. Bereft of nevuah, due to his profound sadness, Yaakov felt all alone. He wondered, what promise could the future hold? What could he do to assure that tragedy would not befall his beloved Binyomin? Though Yehuda was persuasive in trying to reassure his father that Binyomin would be safe with him, Yaakov Avinu was not convinced. But with the hunger taking its toll, despite his misgivings, Yaakov reluctantly agrees to allow Binyomin to travel with his brothers to Egypt under Yehuda’s watchful eye. And Yaakov Avinu conceives a plan. He instructs his sons to package the delicacies of Canaan, honey, nuts, spices and almonds, as a gift for the powerful viceroy. He insists that they return the money found in their sacks as soon as they arrive. Perhaps this will appease the ill tempered keeper of the Egyptian storehouse. What else could he do, to be reunited with Shimon and to assure the safe passage of Binyomin to and from Mitzrayim? From where else could he draw strength?</p>
<p>And then it hits him, as it impacts all who find themselves “mimaakim,” at very depths of frustration and despair, He cast his eyes to Shamayim and davens. Indeed, the the Torah tells us that Yaakov blessed his sons, v’Keil Shakkai yiten lachem rachamim – May Hashem Yisborach grant you mercy in the eyes of this feared man you are about to greet. And Yaakov continues, v’shilach lachem es achichem acher v’es Binyomin – may Hashem send you Shimon the other and Binyomin (so that you can return with them to me). It is interesting to note that Chazal teach us that Yaakov prophesized but did not know it. The word acher in the aforementioned posuk is referencing Yosef who is soon to be reunited with his father.</p>
<p>The text and context is profound. When Yosef was sent to seek his brothers, there was no mention of tefilla. Soon thereafter, he is sold. When the brothers embark on a journey to purchase food in Mitzrayim, again there is no mention of prayer, and Shimon is taken hostage. Without G-d in the picture, enriching and safeguarding each step along the way, anything can (and often does) happen. Now with the final blow seemingly so near and Yaakov Avinu at wits end, he davens and everything “just happens” to work out.n</p>
<p>This message should not be lost on us. Without prayer, all is lost. It is tefilla which energizes our dreams and animates our hopes for tomorrow. Davening brings Hashem Yisborach more closely into our lives and gives us the meaning we so yearn for. If we daven, we might even prophesize &#8211; although we don’t know it.  So strong is the power of prayer. But we need not wait till we are desperate to activate its power.</p>
<p>In many ways, it is prayer that is the very essence of our Chanuka celebrations. The Maccabim’s cry of mi laHashem aili was not only a battle call &#8211; it was a tefilla. The lighting of a menorah with enough oil for only one day was not merely an act of re-dedicating and consecrating the Bais Hamikdash, it was heartfelt prayer to our Master on High to renew His profound ahava with His people once again. This is why we emphasize in Al Hanissim thrice daily and in our bentching that the Chanuka holiday is “l’hodos ulihallel” &#8211;  to give thanks and praise – through prayer to the Ribbono Shel Olam. It is He who is the source of all goodness and it He who quests for our tefilos. We can take advantage of this moment so ripe for prayer to bring ourselves closer to the Ribbono Shel Olam and with His help, may we merit shiyamelu  mishalos libeinu l’tova! Chag Urim Sameach!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #888888;"><em>A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Vayeshev</h2>
<h2>Tzadik v’Tov Lo</h2>
<p>The fascinating saga of mechiras Yosef is filled with lessons for the ages. Yaakov Avinu taught Yosef, the “satano shel Eisav,” all that he learned in Yeshivas Shem v’Eiver. In so doing, he defined for him, and for us, a model of what we are to value and how we are to survive the long bitter golus. As such, each experience provides us eternal lessons to bring the moment of geula one day closer. One interesting insight is developed by the Netziv as he delves in to the puzzling decision of Yaakov Avinu to send Yosef to look for his brothers. Yaakov knew that the brothers were not fond of Yosef. Yosef knew this as well. Nevertheless, as Yaakov calls on Yosef to travel to Shechem, Yosef responds, “hineini.” What was Yaakov thinking? Did he not realize the sakanah of the journey? Could not someone else have been sent? Why was he not afraid for Yosef’s safety?<span id="more-3359"></span></p>
<p>The Netziv explains that Yaakov Avinu knew full well that this mission was fraught with danger. In fact, he was even reticent to send a servant as a messenger, lest he be attacked along the way. However, Yosef was a tzadik. Yaakov Avinu knew that as a righteous individual, Yosef Hatzadik, would be worthy of elevated hashgacha pratis against all forms of non-human danger. This was evidenced by Yosef’s survival in the deep pit filled with snakes and scorpions that would not harm his holy being. Moreover, the risk of human interference in Yosef’s hashgacha pratis (see Orach Chayim Hakadosh 37:21) was also not of concern to Yaakov Avinu. He knew that Yosef hatzadik would be blessed with complete and total individual attention and protection from the guiding hand of the Ribbono Shel Olam because he was not only a tzadik &#8211; he was a tzadik gamur! As such he would be worthy of the bracha of “tzadik v’tov lo”. Not even the hand of a baal bechirah would be able to harm him.</p>
<p>So what is the distinguishing difference between the tzadik and the tzadik gamur? According to the Netziv, the tzadik gamur is not only a giant in piety and Torah scholarship; he is also a master of gemillas chassadim! The tzadik gamur is, as the Netziv expounds in parshas Noach, (Harchev Davar 6:9 *1) “tov laShamayim v’tov labrios!” It is only the individual who is a master of both who is blessed with the extraordinary hashgacha pratis for which we all strive to be worthy.</p>
<p>So confident was Yaakov Avinu in his belief that Yosef was a tzadik gamur that his anguish in seemingly losing him was compounded. Yaakov cried, “tarof taraf Yosef”. He was doubly shocked at what happened to Yosef. How could it be that Yosef was tarof spiritually, bein adam laMakom and taraf physically, bein adam lachaveiro? What went wrong, he sobbed, that such a tragic fate would befall his precious Yosef? He wondered what happened to Yosef’s righteousness that should have shielded him from danger? And this he mourned each day until they were reunited.</p>
<p>This is a powerful message of which we must be vigilantly mindful. Klal Yisrael is desperately in need of extraordinary hashgacha pratis. To be worthy as a klal, each Jew must aspire to refine his character as a tzadik gamur; being a tzadik alone is not enough. Indeed, greatness in Hashem Yisborach’s eyes is all-encompassing. We must strive for excellence in each domain, bein adam laMakom and bein adam lachaveiro. In that zechus may we merit seeing the day when we transcend mei’afeila l’ora bimhara biyameinu.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Hope_s_Helping_Hand.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3308" title="hand reaching" src="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Hope_s_Helping_Hand-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>This dvar Torah also appears in the <a href="http://www.ouwestcoast.org/parshainsights.html" target="_blank">West Coast OU Parsha Insights</a>.</p>
<p>Parshas Vayishlach begins as Yaakov prepares for an epic encounter with Esav from whom he bought the birthright and snatched the Avrahamic tradition. The psukim tell us that Yaakov devised a three-part plan to survive the meeting with an enraged Esav. Yaakov sends gifts, offers a prayer to G-d and divides his camp into two. In the night, Yaakov takes his family across the Yabov waterway. The verse (32:23) tells us that he took his 2 wives and 11 eleven children over the Yabok.</p>
<p>Rashi wonders why only 11 children crossed the Yabok. Including Dina, Yaakov has 12 children. Rashi quotes the Midrash: “And where was Dina? She was locked in a box so that Esav should not see her. For this, Yaakov was punished. Since he withheld Dina from meeting Esav and perhaps influencing him to repent, Dina fell in the hands of Shechem.”<span id="more-3307"></span></p>
<p>Rav Yaakov Weinberg Of Blessed Memory used this Midrash to emphasize how far one must go to reach out to a brother. Yaakov was wrong for hiding Dina from his brother Esav and he should have at least given Esav the opportunity to repent for the sake of marrying Dina. For failing to give Esav a chance, Yaakov was punished. The lesson is profound. Esav was out for vengeance; he wanted to kill Yaakov. Still, Yaakov should have kept his cool and been optimistic for his brother’s success.</p>
<p>Yaakov is criticized for not wanting to influence Esav in a positive way through marriage. What about Leah? A famous Midrash tells us that Leah cried because she did not want to marry Esav. (This is not universal, Onkeles says her eyes were beautiful.) Shouldn’t Leah have welcomed the opportunity to help Esav turn his life around? The Sifsei Chachamim asks a similar question.</p>
<p>Perhaps the verse alludes to this criticism when the Torah relates the story of Dina and Shechem. The verse says “Vatetze Dina bas Leah”, Dina the daughter of Leah went out. Rashi wonders why she is called Dina the daughter of Leah and not Dina the daughter of Yaakov. Rashi quotes the well-known Midrash and says that Dina learned how to be a “yatzanis”, one who “goes out” from her mother Leah.</p>
<p>Maybe the Torah is also alluding to Leah’s failure to marry Esav. The incident served as Divine retribution for Yaakov hiding Dina in a box in an effort to avoid Esav. He should have been open to the opportunity to spur a transformation in Esav. He was not. He was punished. Leah too, was not open to that opportunity. According to the Midrash she bawled because she did not want to marry Esav. Vatezte Dina bas Leah, Dina the daughter of Leah went out. Leah is not off the hook. Yaakov and Leah both made the same kind of error and the result was Shechem defiling Dina.</p>
<p>How far are we supposed to go when we reach out to others? Very far. Here at The Shul on the Beach we don’t need to go very far. Just look around. Just look outside. Just think about your neighbors.</p>
<p>We all have opportunities to influence others. We can influence by teaching or simply by example. If we avoid those opportunities we may be doing a disservice to our brothers and sisters who look to us for guidance and we may be doing a disservice to ourselves as well.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayeitzei</h2>
<h2>Vayishma Yaakov!</h2>
<p>After more than 20 years in Lavan’s home, Yaakov Avinu overhears his cousins, (Lavan’s children) speaking despairingly of him. We are told “Vayar Yaakov es pnei Lavan v’henei ainenu emanu imo kismol shilshom” &#8211; and Yaakov saw that Lavan’s face wasn’t the same as it was the day before. What was it that Yaakov saw? In truth, upon learning of his true standing in the house of Lavan, Yaakov introspected. He reexamined his relationship with his uncle and realized it was one sided. He reassessed his life in Golus away from Eretz Yisrael and away from his parents. He realized he didn’t really belong. Something was amiss. Hashem Yisborach had not spoken with him for over twenty years. It was time for a change.<span id="more-3283"></span></p>
<p>Comes the next Posuk: “Vayomer Hashem El Yaakov Shuv El Eretz Avosecha Ul’moladtecha” &#8211; Hashem says to Yaakov, “Return to the land of your fathers and your birthright”. What happened? Why is it that Hashem Yisborach finally speaks to Yaakov Avinu again, in the very next posuk?</p>
<p>The answer is obvious and insightful. Until Yaakov Avinu recognized that something was wrong, Hakadosh Boruch Hu could not help him make it right. Once Yaakov understood the realities of raising his children in Golus he longed for his true home in Eretz Yisroel. He was then blessed with Geulah, as Hashem spoke to him and directed his return.</p>
<p>This maxim is true in both Ruchniyus and Gashmiyus. The first step to correcting any problem is recognizing it. Once one identifies the issues, steps can be taken to go and improve. Indeed, in dealing with the challenges of rearing our children, educating them for success and building their self-esteem we must take honest stock of their strengths and weaknesses. Then we must look at ourselves and the environment we provide to nurture these goals. If we are honest in our assessment, we can create a game plan for advancement and our children will IY”H thrive.</p>
<p>As soon as Yaakov Avinu realized the risk of further remaining in the Golus of Lavan’s home, he was blessed to merit redemption with his return to Eretz Yisroel. “Maasei Avos Siman LaBanim”: May we, too, be blessed to sense the urgency and danger of our long Golus and our need to reconnect spiritually so that we may strive to merit the brachos of Geulah, bimahara biyameinu, amen.</p>

<h2>Parshas Toldos</h2>
<h2>The Gift of Golus</h2>
<p>One cannot help but be fascinated with the entire episode of Yitzchok Avinu and the brachos intended for Eisav which are surreptitiously taken by Yaakov Avinu. Chazal darshan every nuance of the parsha for yesodos so vital for us today. Chazal wonder (as do we), what was it that Yitzchok Avinu actually intended? What was Rivka’s viewpoint? And what is the lasting lesson?<span id="more-3251"></span></p>
<p>There are many interesting approaches and lessons to be learnt. One insight is derived from an enigmatic Midrash Rabbah which scrutinizes the original instructions given to Eisav. Yitzchok Avinu asks his eldest son, “Sah na keilecha telyicha vkashtecha vtzei hasadeh vtzudah li tzayid – Lift up your gear, your bow and arrow and go out to the field to hunt your prey.” Why is the method of the hunt so important to Yitzchok? Why didn’t Yitzchok Avinu simply request Eisav to bring him dinner? After all, Eisav is the expert hunter.</p>
<p>Chazal explain that a powerful message was being alluded to in Yitzchok’s request of Eisav. We are taught that the eve of this all important Bracha ceremony was leil Pesach and the directives of the posuk symbolically represent the four galuyos. Bavel, Madai, Yavan and Edom. Yitzchok Avinu knew good and well just what Eisav was all about. He wanted to help him. He intended to give him the tools to achieve a complete and total teshuva, the opportunity for spiritual redemption. Similarly, the four goluyos are intended to provide a forced and focused tikun to enable Klal Yisrael to reconnect to the Aibeshter after they err.</p>
<p>We can almost hear Yitzchok Avinu speaking to Eisav with all of his passion, as he implores him. Eisav you have sinned, but you can grow from your mistakes. You can trek from golus to geula if you but seek it as your objective. Stalk the prey of Torah, Tefilla (lasuach basadeh) and teshuva and you can connect to the Ribbon Shel Olam like your brother, Yaakov, the ish tam yoshev ohalim. Sah na keilecha, lift up, elevate and spiritualize your kochos hanfesh, for you have talents that are gifted to you alone. You, too, can be successful and inspire others to do the same. Eisav, this time, as you hunt, leave your special hunting jacket at home. Do not take the easy way out. Go forth through the golus, seek and pursue the emes, you will be rewarded with geula. It is Pesach eve. Is there a moment more ripe for redemption? My dear Eisav, remember, Hashem helps everyone who desires to escape Mitzrayim and their own “mietzarim,” the limitations that bind them to an olam hazehdikeh life. Go forth Eisav, and bring me matamim, the delicacies of a holy lifestyle, of gashmiyus infused and transformed to ruchniyus,  ba’avur tivrechacha nafshi biterem amus so that I may bless you before it too late. Then I can proclaim and you will be worthy of v’iyitein Licha Elokim – Hashem should bless you with all of His, brachos in both Olam Hazeh and Olam Habah!</p>
<p>Rivka Imeinu overhears Yitzchok’s impassioned plea. She realizes that Yaakov, too, desperately needs such a bracha. Not for himself but for us. Sadly, she knows that there will be times when Klal Yisrael will r”l stray. They would need the gift of golus and geula, the power of teshuva to brighten their future. Without it all would be lost. With it, Klal Yisrael would be blessed for eternity.<br />
Rivka readies Yaakov for his masquerade. Dressed up as Eisav, Yaakov quickly arrives with the delicacies prepared by his mother. Yitzchok grows suspicious almost immediately and says mah zeh miharta limtzo b’ni – Eisav my son, how did you accomplish your avodah so quickly?! Is teshuva so easy to achieve? His concern was rapidly allayed as Yaakov responds Ki hikrah Hashem Elokecha – I was gifted Siyata Dishmaya, Hashem Yisborach heard my cry. Indeed we know – pischu li pesach kichudo shel machat vani eftach lach pesach kipischo shel ulom! Yitzchok was satisfied. Indeed, the young man him before was accompanied by the aroma of Gan Eden. The gift of Teshuva, of growth through golus and geula, was now ready to be bestowed upon his son who needed it the most. But thanks to Rivka, it was not Eisav. Instead, it was Yaakov Avinu who in turn gifted to us that precious legacy so that we should be worthy of His blessings.</p>
<p>Yehi Ratzon that we be zocheh to grow from this long golus to the euphoria and clarity of geula. Let us vanquish Eisav and this golus through the koach Hateshuva. V’alu moshi’im b’har Tzion lishpot es har Eisav v’haysa Hashem hamlucha. bimahra biyameinu Amen.</p>

<h2>Parshas Chayei Sara</h2>
<h2>“Vayigdol”</h2>
<p>As Eliezer Eved Avraham introduces himself to Rivka’s father and brother, he speaks of his mission to find a wife for Yitzchok Avinu. He tells them, “Va’Hashem Beirach es Adonee Meod Vayigdol” &#8211; that Hashem had blessed Avraham with much and he has become great.” Indeed, Eliezer reports that Avraham Avinu has become wealthy and achieved much fame and fortune. However, the words of the Posuk seem slightly redundant. Wouldn’t it be enough to say that, “Va’Hashem Beirach es Adonee Meod”—Hashem has blessed Avraham with much.</p>
<p>What is the word “Vayigdol” coming to add to the lavish description of wealth and riches described in the Posuk? The answer given offers a powerful lesson.<span id="more-3176"></span></p>
<p>It is true that Avraham had become quite wealthy. All of Hashem’s bountiful blessings had been bestowed upon him, but that was only part of the message Eliezer wanted to convey. The vital element of Avraham’s legacy is found in the “Vayigdal”—and he became and is still becoming greater. The message Eliezer was transmitting about his master to all of us was that Avraham Avinu never stopped growing! Even after the Akeida and his ten nisyonos, despite the passing of his beloved wife Sarah Imeinu, and after having amassed world-wide fame and fortune, Avraham Avinu sought and found new opportunities and venues to use the gifts presented to him by Hakadosh Baruch Hu to be Mikadesh Shem Shamayim.</p>
<p>This is the quintessential essence of our Jewishness—to emulate Avraham Avinu, to constantly grow spiritually. To continually climb the ladder of gedulah , one rung at a time. To recognize that all the gifts Hashem has bestowed upon us are merely tools for avodas Hashem and hisgalus HaShechina. When we live life with the mantra of “Vayigdol”- constant growth, we are worthy of our distinction as children of Avraham Avinu and can confidently call upon the Ribbono Shel Olam as the Magen Avraham, to give us His continued blessings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<address><span style="color: #888888;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/budget.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3018" title="Budget Rental Truck Tips" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/budget-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="170" /></a>A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov in Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah “Thought”) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayera</h2>
<h2>Reaching Out and Growing Forth</h2>
<p>Immediately following the destruction of Sdom and Lot’s escape to the mountain where he fathered Amon and Moav, the Torah tells us that Avraham Avinu moved to a new home. “Vayisa Misham Avraham Artza Hanegev Vayeishev Bein Kadesh Uvvein Shur… &#8211;  He traveled to the Negev and pitched his tent between Kadesh and Shur.” The Mifarshim are intrigued by this seemingly unnecessary information. What is the lesson therein?<span id="more-3122"></span></p>
<p>Rashi explains the motivation for Avraham’s move. We know that Avraham opened his home to all passersby. He introduced his guests to hakoras Hashem Yisborach through his outstanding hachnasas orchim. After the destruction of Sdom and the surrounding cities, tourism to the former great metropolis of Sdom ceased. Avraham’s house was no longer on a main thoroughfare. Not wanting to be passive, when the opportunity for Mitzvos slowed, Avraham changed location. If mitzvos were not coming his way he made sure to go their way! This is a vital message for us all. We should never become complacent. We must constantly strive to run after mitzvos, even if it may be difficult.</p>
<p>There is more. Rashi adds a davar acher,  a second insight, even more powerful than the first. He explains that Avraham moved in order to distance himself from Lot, who had developed a notorious reputation for immorality. Avraham did not want to be known as a part of Lot’s circle. A mere association with him could negatively impact both Avraham’s personal and familial Ruchniyus as well as his ability to positively influence others. Therefore, despite the challenge, Avraham moved.</p>
<p>Rashi’s dual message has practical implications for each of us. When making choices regarding career, community, home and friendships we must constantly consider these two aspects of our life. How can we best perform and reach out spiritually? Are we running toward mitzvos? Are we set up to make a difference by being Mikadesh Shem Shamayim, being a Torah role model for others? At the same time, we must be vigilant in safeguarding our own ruchniyus and the spiritual mores of our children. Reaching out to others while growing and safeguarding ourselves is the formula for success in Avodas Hashem and emulating Avraham Avinu each and every day.</p>

<h2>Avram&#8217;s Journey</h2>
<h2>Lech Lecha 2009</h2>
<p>The Torah begins the story of our forefather Avraham in this week’s parsha. Thus begins the story of the Jewish people. The first Jew begins his journey in Lech Lecha and that journey defines us for all time. We still feel the effects of that journey. The better we can understand and appreciate that journey, the better we can understand and appreciate ourselves and our personal journey.</p>
<p>God commands Avram (not yet named Avraham) to go. “Lech Lecha” means to go. If we analyze the Torah’s words there is more than meets the eye. The Torah says that GD commands Avram: “Go from your land, from your birthplace and from your father’s home.” If all the Torah wanted us to know was that Hashem had commanded Avram to leave or to go, it would have been sufficient to say “lech” or “tzei” – go.<span id="more-3101"></span> Further, the entire section that mentions leaving his land, birthplace and home is superfluous. And it is in the wrong order! First one leaves one’s home, then one’s birthplace or city, and only then does one leave his land or country.</p>
<p>R’ Hirsch says that the word lech comes from the word halach. And that word is related to Chelek, divided and chalak which means smooth, a surface to which nothing adheres. So halach means to go but it connotes separation as well. Sometimes one can separate for the purpose of going to another place, but in this case, the separating was lecha – for Avram’s self.</p>
<p>Avram is separating from three things: Eretz / country, moledes / hometown, and bayis / home. R’ Hirsch says that these three things form the foundation for one’s personality and true essence. Eretz, the country or nationality with all its moral implications. Eretz is like eres – married.  Eres also means cradle. In comparison to  shamayim (heaven) which is sham (over there), the land, our country gives us our cradle in which we learn our morality. Our land gives us national characteristics and the tremendous power of participation in a nation.</p>
<p>Moledes, birthplace, gives us civic position and independence Even narrower is the bayis, the home where we find our individuality and we grow as unique people.</p>
<p>These Hebrew words make it clear that the Torah values the worth of one’s home and homeland. The Torah is not belittling these concepts by asking Avram to isolate from them. Rather, the Torah is telling us the value of these realms and the greatness of the isolation GD demanded from Avram.</p>
<p>In fact, these demands place Avram in direct conflict with the strongest ideals of his era. Centralism was the prevalent tendency of his age. The feared monarch Nimrod, from whom Avram was running, led the Tower of Babel campaign. That campaign was marked by the slogan of “naaseh lanu shem” – we can make ourselves a name. The tower was to represent the community in general for the glory of mankind. This tendency begot an erroneous conception of a majority which has sway in every direction and every case. And eventually, what is honored by the majority ipso facto becomes the thing that is honored by everybody.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that the majority opinion should be well represented in the community and it should represent that which is highest and holiest by everybody. And in Judaism we would expect the same. Still at the very start of the Jewish journey we are taught: Lech Lecha, go for yourself. Stand on your own, separated from the crowd. No one should limit him or herself to the majority. You cannot be only as honest as everybody else, or as moral as everybody else. We must rise above the majority.</p>
<p>Each person is responsible to GD for himself and if necessary to be alone with GD if he can find no partners with whom to worship. This is what GD demanded from Avram at the start of his journey and the start of our collective journey. The beautiful insights into Hebrew language show us how important eretz, molad and bayis are to us and lech lecha tells us that they are only trumped by the bond that attaches us to GD.</p>
<p>There are always those who say that Judaism should be current and up to date with modern ideals. There are some modern ideals that are consistent with Torah; perhaps social conventions caused them to be ignored until they became prevalent in a modern world. We should and must celebrate those ideals. But, Avram’s first stand was not in accordance with the ancient cultures with whom he lived. While the whole world sought every effort to establish themselves; as civilizations became more complex, Avram was giving up his citizenship and his homeland. He protested the idol worship of the other nations. He separated from it all.</p>
<p>Avram was appointed the first Jew, but he had to prove himself first. He had to prove that he could rise up above the fray and be separate. Avram showed us by example.</p>
<p>Our country, our city, our homes all represent inertia. When we revert to the comfort of habits, customs, and thoughts that we are accustomed to, we are relying too heavily on our cradle that we were raised in. We often fail to move forward because of fear or doubt. Hashem tells Avram, Lech Lecha, do what is right. Do what you know you must do to ensure that you will be separate, that you will be elevated and above the customs and traditions into which you were born.</p>
<p>The lesson of lech lecha is that we must act with conviction and that we must act with a trust and hope for future. Avram could have been reluctant to leave all that he left behind. After all one’s country, hometown and home cane be good values, our core values in fact. But sometimes we need to rise above our complacency and elevate ourselves to heights that can only come when we act with the conviction of lech lecha and we make a substantial break from our inertia and instead act in a way that will bond even more strongly with our families, our neighborhoods, our homelands and above all with GD</p>
<p>In our lives we are called upon to make that same choice so many times. What are my priorities? What is the deciding factor in my decisions?</p>
<p>Avram was also faced with tough choices. How did he respond? What was GD’s call to him? Choose GD, above all. Choose spirituality and Torah above all.</p>
<p>Lech Lecha tells us that our homeland, our city and our homes are all important. They all have tremendous value, but ultimately the choice that is right is the choice that will bind us closest to GD. The choice that brings us the greatest spiritual growth and opportunity to sanctify the name of GD is the right choice. That is the call of Lech Lecha.</p>

<h2>Parshas Lech Lecha</h2>
<h2>Self Improvement</h2>
<p>Parshas Lech Lecha is filled with the lessons of the Jewish experience past, present and future. Each nuance of the parsha is emblazoned with yet another yesod of maassei avos siman labanim and the gift of netzach Yisrael. Moreover, the unique relationship and destiny Klal Yisrael has with Eretz Yisrael is entwined with almost every narrative of this week’s parsha as the first chapter in our legacy of a people is recorded for eternity. No less than four times does Hashem Yisborach promise, commit and reassure Avraham Avinu that Eretz Yisrael is to be his and his children’s forever. Ultimately, Bris Milah solidifies the covenant that the Eibeshter executes with Avraham Avinu and Am Yisrael – Eretz Yisrael is ours forever.</p>
<p>The relationship between the gift of Eretz Yisrael and the covenent of Bris Milah is curious. What is the quid pro quo? <span id="more-3100"></span>A fascinating Sifrei in Parshas Devarim provides an incredible insight.</p>
<p>The Sifrei explains that Hashem Yisborach gave Eretz Yisrael to Avraham (and to Yitzchok and Yaakov) in “as is” condition. The message &#8211; the land of Eretz Yisrael will be what you make of it. The Avos understood this and each of them made improvements to upgrade, embellish and enhance the holy land and our relationship to it. They not only improved the land, they made it personal -Avraham by planting an eishel, Yitzchok as he planted meah shearim and Yaakov when by purchasing Shechem. In so doing they validated the trust Hashem Yisborach placed in them. They not only took what Hashem Yisborach gifted to them, they made it better! This aspect of maasei avos siman labanim is vital for us all. Indeed life is given to us in an “as is” condition – it is up to us to make the necessary improvements through tikkun hamiddos, limud haTorah and maasim tovim.</p>
<p>This too is the essence of the mitzvah of Bris Mila. The Gemara recounts how the Roman general Turnus Rufus once taunted Rabbi Akiva and queried, “What is greater the accomplishments of man or of G-d?” Rabbi Akiva responded, “Man’s accomplishments are superior.” The emperor mocked Rabbi Akiva and pointed to the beauty of nature, the magnificent sky above the horizon, asking, “Can man do this?” Whereupon Rabbi Akiva responded with sheaves of wheat and delicious cakes alongside loaves of bread and retorted “who made the bread and the pastries  – is it not the power of human creativity?” Such is the analogy to Bris Milah, to Eretz Yisrael and even to our everyday life.  Each of us is created in the image of Hashem. We arrive in an “as is” condition and it is up to each individual to perfect himself or herself. We are born with so much opportunity and unbelievable potential but it is up to us actualize it. We must develop ourselves to serve Hashem as He intends. With blood, sweat and tears we can do what it takes to make a difference, to serve as a light to all nations and reveal the hidden truths of Hashem Yisborach’s glory for all to see.</p>
<p>This lesson of self-improvement is part and parcel of the maasei avos siman labanim defined in our parsha. It sets the tone for defining Jewish destiny, and creating a home and family environment with which to rear children into adulthood. Let us make each day better than the last. It is a sacred mission we must live to the fullest.</p>

<h2><span><span>Parshas</span> Noach</span></h2>
<h2>ROYGBIV</h2>
<p><span>As the <span>Ramban</span> points out, the world was blessed during the seven days of creation with the phenomena of the rainbow, a magnificent display of color. We can even see “mini-rainbows” as we spray water in the air on a bright sunny day. Indeed, the beautiful spectrum of light is refracted through the prismatic effect of moisture in the sky. We must wonder: why was the rainbow selected by <span>Hashem</span> <span>Yisborach</span> as the symbol of His “<span>bris</span>” to never again destroy the entire world through a catastrophic flood? What is the <span>middah</span> <span>kineged</span> <span>middah</span> connection between the flood and the <span>keshes</span> and what unique qualities can we learn from this inter-relationship.</span><span id="more-2918"></span></p>
<p><span>Our <span>Chachamim</span> point out that the ultimate flaw of the <span>dor</span> <span>hamabul</span> was their selfishness; their total disregard for their fellow man. <span>Chamas</span>, petty theft, was the straw that broke the camel’s back in a generation exhibiting every form of moral decay. Indeed, they looked at the world as a place with no limits or boundaries. An opportunity to do “what I want, when I want and with whom.” They no longer saw or respected the significance of the individual or the community. They had no sense of private property, personal or communal responsibility. They lost touch with their essence of having been created b’<span>tzelem</span> <span>Elokim</span> and no longer viewed their Creator as involved in daily events. They were hopelessly lost, except for Noach. The worst aspects of human nature had consumed them.</span></p>
<p><span> Enter the rainbow. The pure, unblemished sun’s white light which warms and sustains our entire world is a seemingly boundless and unlimited source of energy. However, as it is refracted through the misty lens of the clouds we can see that the gift of light from <span>Hashem</span> is not a lack of color but a combination of it all. Through the prism we see individual bands of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet maintaining their discipline in place. Yes, the rainbow carries a unique message. Each color of the <span>keshes</span> symbolizes to us the importance and discipline of the individual performing his unique role while working together with others to combine into one. As Jews we are especially conscious of the unique individual roles we play in creating the totality of <span>Klal</span> <span>Yisrael</span>. We are men, women and children, who play different roles in the <span>klal</span> as do our <span>Kohanim</span>, Levi’<span>im</span> and <span>Yisraelim</span>. Only by maintaining our roles and adhering to boundaries do we truly create a seemingly seamless light force. <span>Mitzvos</span> are the same. Each has its own unique spiritual hue and color. When combined by the totality of Am <span>Yisrael</span>, they form the spectacular luminance of the <span>ohr</span> <span>haganuz</span> which awaits us l’<span>asid</span> <span>lavo</span>.</span></p>
<p>The dor hamabul thought that they would enlighten their lives by modeling the sun and its apparently boundless state of matter. They too lived life without limits.</p>
<p>They were dreadfully wrong.</p>
<p><span><span>Hashem</span> teaches us through the rainbow that just the opposite is true. Torah demands structure and discipline.  It is only within the limits and boundaries of <span>Halacha</span> that our defined mission is actualized. Through our personal and communal <span>avoda</span> we create the essence of <span>Klal</span> <span>Yisrael</span> as an <span>ohr</span> la’<span>amim</span>, a spectacular light to all nations. And in so doing, we can generate that most brilliant light which <span>Hashem</span> <span>Yisborach</span> has stored away for our future. May we be <span>zocheh</span> to bask in its rays <span>bimharah</span> <span>biyameinu</span>. </span></p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Korach</h2>
<h2>Personal Responsibility</h2>
<p>Parshas Korach is famous for its tale of strife, conflict and ambition as the leadership of Klal Yisrael is called into question by Korach and his minions. Corrupted by jealousy they fatally err in questioning the authority of Moshe and Aharon. They are forever known as baalei machlokes – dangerous fomenters of dissent whose ego and pride literally removed them from this world and the next! Ultimately they find themselves swallowed alive to declare forever Moshe emes v’Toraso emes.</p>
<p>Though the machlokes and downfall of Korach is the primary feature of the parsha there are many other iyunim to be studied. One interesting issue to explore is found in the details of pidyon haben reviewed again<span id="more-2550"></span> as a part of the parsha’s summary of the matnos Kehuna unto which Aharon and the Kohanim are entitled.</p>
<p>The Torah reminds that (18:16) pidyon haben is accomplished through the transfer of five shekalim to the Kohein. This somewhat rare mitzvah is always a delight to behold. Interestingly there is a machlokes Rishonim whether or not one can fulfill the mitzvah of pidyon haben with a shaliach. L’chora it is not a mitzvas haguf. So why, then, are there Rishonim who exclude using an agent for mitzvas pidyon haben. After-all one can even marry using a shaliach. Why is using an agent not a viable option for pidyon haben?</p>
<p>Naturally, there is much &#8220;reid&#8221; on the subject. However there is a mehalach based on aggadah which is worthwhile exploring and taking a lesson from.</p>
<p>The Medrash Hagadol states that one of the taamim for the mitzvah of Pidyan Haben is that it is to provide a tikkun and a kapporah to Klal Yisrael for mechiras Yosef by his brothers. As such the answer to our quandary is simple. Since forgiveness and atonement are involved, one’s personal engagement is necessary.  kaporrah cannot be accomplished by someone else. When one hurts another (even if he thinks he is right as was the case with the brothers) it is he who has to say he is sorry, an emissary is not enough. Moreover, the responsibility for that tikkun is personal.</p>
<p>This vital message is sometime lost in the day to day rigors of life. We tend to treat people as commodities or objects. We can even forget that others have feelings too! This aspect of pidyon haben reminds us to stop and take our actions, responsibilities and other people seriously. It admonishes us to watch what we say and do and be concerned with its long-term impact.</p>
<p>When it comes to our bein adam lachaveiro we must be responsible, sensitive and caring. That responsibility cannot be doled out to a representative it must be personal.  It is so worth our time!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/33_15_15-fire-flame-texture_web.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2544" title="fire" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/33_15_15-fire-flame-texture_web-300x179.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="179" /></a>This week we read the story of Korach and his rebellion. The rebels were unhappy with the distribution of power in the Israelite camp and made their voices heard.</p>
<p>Technically, Korach and his followers were mored b&#8217;malchus, they rebelled against the defacto king of the Jewish people in the desert, Moshe. They attempted to undermine Moshe and the system of Kohanim and Leviim as it was implemented in the Mishkan and religious life of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>The roots of their sins are many and the opinions run the gamut of social and religious ills.<br />
<span id="more-2543"></span></p>
<p>God tells Moshe to test the veracity of the rebels by offering incense. A fire comes and consumes the rebels against the Kohen and Levi system. Just before the fire comes, God instructs Moshe and Ahron to separate themselves from the midst of the rebels. It appears that in order for God to succesfully smite the rebels, Moshe and Ahron need to get out of the way.</p>
<p>The Ramban is troubled by this detail. God can certainly save Moshe and Ahron from death even if they are right in the middle of the rebels! Why must they separate.</p>
<p>Reb Tzadok from Lublin writes that even when one sees that they have Divine assistance in their actions it does not mean that God has &#8220;signed off&#8221; on their actions. One could see or even experience God&#8217;s help and yet be doing the wrong thing. This is because God responds to mesiras nefesh, behavior that indicates one&#8217;s willingness to sacrifice their time, personal pleasure and even their life, for a cause. Remarkably, God&#8217;s response is not limited to causes that are &#8220;right&#8221;.</p>
<p>Korach had an altruistic motive. According to Reb Tzadok, Korach was ahead of his time. He was living in a world where each person&#8217;s kedusha was limited. But he wanted to be living in a future time, where everyone would have equal kedusha. He wanted it so badly, he knew he was going to die for his cause. He was willing to do whatever it takes. That was mesiras nefesh. His cause was flawed, but he still had mesiras nefesh.</p>
<p>God tells Moshe and Ahron to separate from Korach&#8217;s rebellion because Korach&#8217;s mesiras nefesh was recognized by God and could have cause the demise of Moshe and Ahron had they stayed intermingled with Korach and his rebels.</p>
<p>I find this to be a profound message in two ways. First, sometime it seems to us like the &#8220;universe&#8221; is helping us along, or God is giving us direct assistance, and we think that we must be on the right track. &#8220;Not so fast&#8221;, says Reb Tzadok. God gives assistance to those who are moser nefesh. Not necessarily those who are right. Second, the importance of mesiras nefesh in our avodas Hashem. It is worth noting that a Jewish life is going to be different than a secular life. When we do whatever it takes and we sacrifice time, status, money, pleasure all in deference to Judaism we are tapping into the great power of mesiras nefesh and hopefully it will bring us Divine assistance in our lives.</p>

<h2>Parshas Shelach</h2>
<h2>Dvar Hashem Baza</h2>
<p>Parshas Shlach Lecha is filled with lessons for eternity. Nestled in between the chet hameraglim and parshas tzizis is a fascinating phrase with significant halachic impact. The Torah tells us that an individual who transgresses the aveirah of avodah zarah intentionally is chayav kares. The reason given is ki dvar Hashem baza, the idolator has disgraced the word of Hashem.</p>
<p>The Gemara in Meseches Sanhedrin (99a) darshens many halachos from this phrase. One drasha is so extraordinary it seems not to go with the rest, <span id="more-2516"></span>which mostly deal with the classic definition of chilul Hashem and the rejection of Torah. This astonishing limud is taught by Rabbi Mayer who explains, “How do we define the concept of dvar Hashem baza?” It is one who is lomaid Torah v’aino melamdo, an individual that learns Torah and doesn’t teach it!</p>
<p>Understood literally, Rabbi Mayer proffers a frightening statement, because most members of Klal Yisroel are not professional pedagogues. Could it really be true that the overwhelming majority of Klal Yisroel who are not engaged in the chinuch profession are considered to have transgressed ki dvar Hashem baza? How are we to understand this statement?</p>
<p>Obviously, the words of Rabbi Mayer must go beyond the literal meaning of teaching others Torah in a classroom setting. Taken more deeply, the words of Rabbi Mayer scream out to us a message, which we can all take to heart.</p>
<p>We know that at Matan Torah, Klal Yisroel was designated as an ohr l’amim, a light to all nations. We are supposed to be a beacon of emunah and bitachon in the Ribbono Shel Olam. Even non-Jews should be able to develop an affinity for Hashem Yisborach as a result of their interactions with Klal Yisroel. We are not merely called the Chosen People, rather we are expected to act the part. Within Klal Yisroel, it is no different. In our homes, in the workplace, in shul, and every place in between, we are all representatives of Hakadosh Baruch Hu. Each of us is a role model as to how a Torah Jew should behave. Whether in business dealings, interpersonal relationships, or our passion for mitzvos, everything we do is an example for others. Rabbi Mayer teaches us that a person who has learned Torah and doesn’t teach it by the way he lives and acts, is one of whom it is said ki dvar Hashem baza, he has despised the words of Hakadosh Baruch Hu. Torah is not merely meant for intellectual stimulation or emotional satisfaction, it is meant to live by. And as we live it, we teach it.</p>
<p>Indeed, every one of us is a rebbe/morah to our children, our friends, our neighbors, and the community at large. It is an opportunity and responsibility not to be missed or taken for granted!</p>

<h2>Parsha Beha&#8217;aloscha</h2>
<h2>Nisunim Nisunim</h2>
<p>For three weeks we have been learning of the uniqueness, responsibility and leadership expected from the tribe of Yaakov and Leah’s third son, shevet Levi. The Rambam explains their role in his famous words which conclude hilchos shmitta v’yoveil and teaches us that shevet Levi is huvdal la’avod es Hashem l’sharso . . . as cheil Hashem. Moreover, the Rambam continues not only is shevet Levi so designated but any Yid, who wishes to devote his life to the total service of the Ribbono Shel Olam, is considered an honorary member of shevet Levi as well.</p>
<p>While parshiyos Bamidbar and Naso introduced us to the Levites role and their special tasks of the nosei haMishkan, Bahaaloscha defines their ascent to distinction.<span id="more-2498"></span> Though a Levi is accorded the rights to maaser and the second aliya by virtue of his birth it is only as a result of the ceremony described at the beginning of this week’s parsha that their role is defined for eternity. It is a ritual worth studying. First they were purified. Indeed the prerequisite quality of leadership is tahara. Corruption has no place at the helm and must be eradicated from the start. Next is a korban. Personal sacrifice and selflessness for the Ribbono Shel Olam and for the klal is the mantra of every Levite’s life. Ultimately the final act of consecration is hanafah – the waving of each Levi as if he were the arbah minim. This protocol directs the Levi to focus his spiritual energies on each and every one of the six sides – north, east, west, south, top and bottom of our three dimensional world. Finally, he is ready for the task ahead. This entire ceremony leads up to shevet Levi’s Torah ordained role. Not just to be the distinctive spiritual shevet of Klal Yisrael but to be nisunim nisunim mitoch Bnei Yisrael.</p>
<p>Rashi quotes Chazal and explains that the phrase nisunim nisunim means nisunim l’masah nisunmin lashir, selected for burdens and selected for song. What defines a Levi? It is his ability to carry the spiritual load of Am Yisrael and to do it with song. To manage responsibility with joy! This defines the quintessential role of the Levi and is a model for us all. Ivdu es Hashem b’simcha is not just a catch phrase. It is to be a way of life.</p>
<p>The Netziv notes that the hanafah portion of the ceremony is done twice. Once before and once after the korban, Why? The first hanafah was to wave their hearts towards the darchei Hashem the second was to focus their mind to Yedias Hashem. These two ingredients heart and mind, feelings and intellect are critical for the Levi to achieve his mission. One cannot reach the madreiga of  nisunuin nisunim without them. First is a feeling heart corresponding to nisunim limasah. Indeed, it is the nisinas halev, the love we have for the Ribbono Shel Olam that helps one tolerate the ol mitzvos. Nevertheless, with all the heart in the world, it will remain a burden, which risks being cast aside, unless there is also an intellectual understanding of the important job being done. One needs limud, and yideas haTorah to enable the song of simcha to burst forth. True joy is not found in emotion alone. It must be combined with deep and penetrating knowledge. This is a valuable message to heed. In many ways we all carry the distinct banner of “shevet Levi” as His beacons of Torah living. We must strive to be nisunim nisunim &#8211; responsible and happy in the great role we have been gifted.</p>

<p>This week we read Parshas Beha&#8217;aloshca. Aside from being the most difficult parsha to transliterate a bit of trivia is present. The famous verse &#8220;Vayihi b&#8217;nsoa ha&#8217;aron&#8221; is found in the parsha and in the sefer Torah (and most Chumashim) it is surrounded by an upside down letter nun. One upside down nun before the verse and one upside down nun is after the verse. This strange phenomena needs some explanation.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like in a Sefer Torah:<span id="more-2486"></span></p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-5423" href="http://finkorswim.com/?attachment_id=5423"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5423" src="http://www.frumsatire.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/nunhafucha.jpg" alt="" width="462" height="108" /></a></p>
<p>The Talmud in Shabbos (116a) explains that the verse does not belong here. It is out of place. It really belongs when the Israelite camps made their first journey in parshas Bamidbar however it is in our parsha instead. The reason it is found here is to separate between two negative stories.</p>
<p>The rishonim are all bothered by this reasoning. There is nothing negative that directly precedes the upside down nuns! What does the gemara mean?</p>
<p>The negative story that follows the upside down nun is fairly obvious. In fact there are two negative stories taht occur back to back following the upside down nun. First there were the misoninim who were consumed in a heavenly fire and then the next set of complainers were not happy with the steady diet mon, they wanted a variety of food. The Ramban quotes the gemara that says that the negative story that precedes the upside nun is the verse that says &#8220;vayisu mehar sinai&#8221; (and they left Mt. Sinai). The Ramban explains that byb saying they &#8220;left&#8221; it connotes the feeling a child has when school is over. They slam their books closed pack up their backpacks and run out the door before they can get a new assignment. Similarly, Klal Yisrael did not want any more mitzvos so they &#8220;got out of Dodge&#8221; as quickly as they could. Clearly, this reflects a very negative attitude among the Jewish people. Therefore, the chumash interrupts the narrative to break up the fleeing of Mt. Sinai and the negative stories of the misoninim and the mon complainers.</p>
<p>But why? Who cares if there are 3 consecutive negative stories?</p>
<p>The Ramban says that we break up the narrative so that there is no chazaka or status quo of negativity. In Torah law there is a concept of muchzakos. Applied here, when one acts a certain way 3 consecutive times, <em>that</em> type of behavior becomes the default. We don&#8217;t want the default to be negative behavior. Therefore the Torah interrupts the negative behavior with vayihi b&#8217;nsoah.</p>
<p>I think that this is important. Behaviors can become second nature. My great great grandfather, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elyah_Lopian" target="_blank">Reb Elya Lopian</a> taught that sometimes second nature is <em>harder</em> to change than our real nature. Once we &#8220;learn&#8221; a behavior it becomes so natural that it is more difficult to break away from that behavior than it is to change our natural behavior. Habit can be a toxic thing. The Torah reminds us here that negative behavior is bound to occur. We just cannot make a habit out of negative behavior.</p>
<p>There is also a great comfort in knowing that just as our negative behavior can become second nature, our positive behavior can as well. When we string together 3 consecutive acts of good behavior, those good behaviors can also become habits. Those are really good habits. It can be hard to try to adopt a new behavior or characteristic into our lives, but if we can pull it off just 3 times in a row, we can make it a habit and it will become second nature to be great.</p>

<p><em><strong><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Census-Bureau-298x300.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2461" title="Census-Bureau" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Census-Bureau-298x300.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="210" /></a>Cross-posted to <a href="http://wp.me/pigUY-1lL" target="_blank">Frumsatire.net</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p><em> </em>The fourth book in the 5 books of Moses will be read in Shul this week. Each of these 5 books has 2 operative names. The first parsha of each book gives them their standard name. These names are Breishis, Shmos, Vayikra, Bamidbar and Devarim.</p>
<p>There is another set of names that we find in Chazal as well as in the King James version of the Bible. The Ramban and other rishonim find meaning in this second set of names. Breishis is Sefer Hayetzira or Genesis, Shmos is Sefer Hageulah or Exodus, Vayikra is Toras Kohanim or Leviticus, Devarim is Mishna Torah or Deuteronomy. <span id="more-2458"></span>Those names are really obvious choices for the stories they tell. Breishis deals with the Torah&#8217;s version of the birth of the universe and the birth of the Abrahamic family. Shmos deals with the story of the exodus from Egpyt as well as the necessary components for a Jewish life: Torah and a Temple. Vayikra deals with all the laws that pertain to Kohanim and Leviim. Devarim is a lot of review (plus some new stuff) by Moshe so it&#8217;s name reflects the &#8220;duo&#8221;ness of its content.</p>
<p>Bamidbar is called Chumash Hapekudim or Numbers. It seems strange to call a book by an event that happens in the book twice. Especially when that event seems to be very administrative in nature. The 2010 census was important but is it important enough that we would call 2010 &#8220;The Year of the Census&#8221;?! I wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>What could be the meaning behind calling the 4th book, the Book of Numbers?</p>
<p>The Netziv, as are many others, is bothered by this question. In his introduction to Sefer Bamidbar the Netziv supplies us with a clue as to what the message of Sefer Bamidbar could be. The book is a book of transition. It begins with the Jewish people who left Egypt and would never see the land of Israel and concludes with a new crop of Jews who would enter the land of Israel. In fact, there is actually a section of Bamidbar that Chazal call a book unto itself. The verse of &#8220;Vayihi Binsoa&#8221; is its &#8220;own book&#8221;. By splitting Bamidbar, in essence this makes Bamidbar into 3 books.</p>
<p>The first part of the book is when the Jewish people are counted in reference to their flags and their place in the camp. The formation of the Jewish camp was like a chariot for the Mishkan and the divine presence within. This counting was of the Jews living in the desert and their way of serving God. However the second counting in Pinchas follows the death and plagues that struck the Jewish people for their participation in the sin of spies, the division of Korach and the immorality with the women of Midyan. This was a new generation who would enter the land of Israel and the second census was to determine the division of the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>Viewed in this light, Bamidbar is a book that tells the story from one counting to the next. These are not incidental censuses. These countings go to the heart of the journey through the desert. This book is truly a Book of Numbers that begins and ends with countings that are representative of sweeping change within the Jewish people.</p>
<p>The Dor Deya (those who saw the Splitting of the Sea and the Revelation at Sinai) with their miraculous existence would never see the Land of Israel and the physical existence of waging war and tilling the land for food. Bamidbar tells the story of how we changed from a people living a spiritual existence to a people living a physical existence a trying to infuse that physical existence with spirituality.</p>
<p>In life we often pass milestones or go through transitional periods. These times can be great opportunities to make changes or grow as a person. I think the Book of Numbers is a great reminder of this important and relevant lesson.</p>
