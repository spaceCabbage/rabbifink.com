				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wouldn&#8217;t quite call it a trend, but a growing number of women and girls in the Orthodox Jewish community are interested in wearing tefillin publicly. Two Modern Orthodox schools have made public statements that indicate they will allow, not encourage or discourage, their students to wear tefillin.</p>
<p>This has generated a lot of discussion, mostly negative, from within the Orthodox Jewish community. Some of the JewsNews sites have reported this bit of news in a very negative way. Some, to the very liberal side of Orthodox Judaism have embraced the decision.<span id="more-8076"></span></p>
<p>The halachic background is not overly complex. Technically, tefillin should fall into the same category as all other time bound mitzvos. Lulav, Shofar, Sukkah, and daily prayer are also time bound mitzvos and are voluntary for women. The conclusion in the Talmud exempts women from tefillin. Some rishonim explicitly permit tefillin for women. Some explicitly prohibit it. The Rema famously discourages it. That is, he does not prohibit it, he just advises against it. Some of the Achronim explain why it would be prohibited or advised against. <a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tefillin_barbie.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8077" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tefillin_barbie.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Some people are assuming their intentions are less than perfect. That&#8217;s complete conjecture and not something worth discussing. But I think the halachic arguments are important. I also think that working out whether it&#8217;s permitted or prohibited is vital. But I think it&#8217;s misplaced in the context of the current issue. The discussion right now should not be whether it&#8217;s good policy or against our best interests to allow women to wear tefillin.</p>
<p>Instead, the discussion should be whether we <em>tolerate</em> women who want to wear tefillin in Orthodox Judaism. In other words, even if I disagree with their decision, is this something worth the cost of declarations and opinions that cast these women and these institutions in a negative light?</p>
<p>We already disagree on plenty of things and we can get along just fine. Some eat kitniyos on Pesach, others do not. Some use the eruv, some do not. Some open soda cans on Shabbos, others do not. Some visit rebbes and ask for blessings, others do not. Some go to Uman, others do not. Some say Kabbalas Shabbos, others do not. Some do Yom Kippur Katan, others do not. Some do every segula, some do none. There are literally hundreds of things that already divide us in practice. Yet we are capable of carrying on as a group. I don&#8217;t see why a few women putting on tefillin should be such a drastic decision that it means more than eating in the Sukkah on Shmini Atzeres vs. not eating in the Sukkah on Shmini Atzeres.</p>
<p>In other words, what are the stakes here? And why are they being presented as so great? What is going to happen if a few women wear tefillin? What&#8217;s the dire consequence that we must avoid at all costs?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see it. I think those who don&#8217;t want women to wear tefillin should just not wear tefillin or even teach their daughters that they don&#8217;t think they should wear tefillin. But I don&#8217;t see how doing a mitzvah can make someone unorthodox.</p>
<p>If an opponent of women wearing tefillin found out his daughter started wearing tefillin, would the daughter be disowned? I can&#8217;t imagine. So why are we disowning other daughters?</p>
<p>The opposition must identify something objectively wrong that will happen if we <em>tolerate </em>a few women wearing tefillin. Or even if we <em>tolerate </em>many women wearing tefillin. Until they&#8217;ve done so, I don&#8217;t think we can allow this difference to divide us. We&#8217;ve been able to avoid completely breaking apart over a million other things. I don&#8217;t accept that this particular issue is so vital that it must break us up now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/world/middleeast/plan-to-resolve-western-wall-prayer-controversy.html?_r=1&amp;"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6923" alt="ISRAEL-articleLarge" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ISRAEL-articleLarge.jpg?resize=300%2C200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>All hail Natan Sharansky, peacemaker. We hope.</p>
<p>The world has become witnesses to a very public and somewhat embarrassing battle over the Kotel. Although instead of the familiar disagreements between Palestinians and Israelis, this scuffle pitted Jew against Jew.</p>
<p>The Kotel is maintained by orthodox Jews who would like to preserve an atmosphere that is similar to orthodox synagogues and everything that entails. Many find attempts by women to lead small prayer services offensive. The women prayer services are often led by Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall. Hoffman has been arrested several times for leading such services and for the severe offense of wearing a particular kind of tallit.</p>
<p>The conflict was escalating and becoming more and more ugly with each passing arrest. More orthodox Jews cast aspersion toward Hoffman and more liberal minding Jews stood behind her.</p>
<p>The Forward first reported a breakthrough in negotiations headed by Natan Sharansky. The NY Times spoke with Sharansky and describes the plan:<span id="more-6922"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mr. Sharansky’s proposal involves expanding and improving the areas accessible for prayer at the wall to include the southern section known as Robinson’s Arch which, under his plan, would be open for Jews wishing to pray in a less Orthodox, more egalitarian style 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The main prayer section, which is now divided into men’s and women’s sections, would remain the domain of more traditional worshippers.</p>
<p>Sounds good to me!</p>
<p>Sharansky has close to ties to my family and my shul. My great uncle was responsible for his release from Soviet prison (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Greenwald#Natan_Sharansky" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) and Sharansky&#8217;s daughter married a young man who grew up in my shul. His father, <strong>Alan Danziger</strong>, is the president of Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>Alan told me that Sharansky was charged with coming up with a solution and he (jokingly) asked my advice. I suggested a three section Kotel (men, women, egalitarian) with each group getting use of the best area in the northenmost corner of the Kotel once in a while. I also thought it wise to have non-orthodox Jews participate in the administration of the Kotel.</p>
<p>So I am very pleased with the proposal. It&#8217;s not exactly what I suggested, but close enough. I really hope all parties will agree. The NY Times reports that Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall are not completely satisfied with the plan <em>&#8220;but we will compromise. You don’t always have to be right, you have to be smart, and compromise is a sign of maturity and understanding what’s at stake here.”</em></p>
<p>Compromise is good. Let&#8217;s hope everyone will be willing to accept this proposal.</p>
<p>Some have argued that people who are not comfortable with the current orthodox arrangements at the Kotel are few in number and they are too few to matter. I think this is ludicrous. Perhaps if more people were made to feel comfortable at our Holiest place, more people who are not orthodox sympathetic would come to the Kotel to pray and be inspired.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that is a good result.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Haredi-Secular.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6127" title="Haredi-Secular" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Haredi-Secular.jpg?resize=300%2C160" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This week&#8217;s Time Magazine features a cover story on Jerusalem. Although, it is not an article about the BBC pretending that Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel, nor is it an article about East Jerusalem Arabs trying to attain Israeli citizenship. The article is about the cultural war and the turf war between secular Jews and ultra-orthodox / charedi Jews in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The focus of the article is on one &#8220;mixed&#8221; neighborhood where the charedi presence has significantly increased as the secular presence has decreased. Although the article is talking about a few individuals, the behavior described in the article can best be described as juvenile. Both sides have their villains, and in their attempt to gain control over the neighborhood both sides play pranks, vandalize, intimidate, and in general refuse to communicate.<span id="more-6124"></span></p>
<p>Sure, the article makes some technical mistakes and some incorrect assumptions, but I don&#8217;t really care about that. What I do care about is how the sad truth that in today&#8217;s society some Jews can&#8217;t figure out how to get along with each other unless the other person is just like them. That story is a story being repeated over and over again in many communities around the world.</p>
<p>Our schools and shuls are becoming more and more monolithic, our attitude toward the outside is becoming less and less tolerant, and what we are willing to do and sacrifice is becoming greater and greater for the sake of insularity. I find this trend disturbing on many levels. But the situation in Israel demonstrates to a certain degree the logical conclusion to this cycle.</p>
<p>It is a very sad state of affairs when we cannot even live happily amongst Jews. I don&#8217;t excuse the secular guerrilla warfare exposed in Time Magazine such as cutting eruv wires or slapping nude posters on synagogue walls. That is disgraceful behavior. But I also don&#8217;t excuse bullying people out of their homes or enforcing tznius standards on non-religious people.</p>
<p>If all the energy that is being used to outsmart and outwit the other side was used to figuring out how to live together, all the problems would certainly be solved. But it&#8217;s not even an option anymore. The baseline standard is to live apart from one another. I find this very sad.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that Time Magazine is a particularly good venue for this discussion, but it is a discussion that must take place. Is the goal to have a city like Jerusalem completely charedi? Is that what we are striving for? Is that what God wants from us? Will that city be a place that we can all be proud of? Is it moral to impose our religious standards on others?</p>
<p>Honestly, I can&#8217;t answer those questions with any sense of certainty. But those who are answering those questions with certainty, and are trying take control of Jerusalem or any other place in a similar situation, need to have satisfactory answers to those questions. If there is anything that this long dark exile has taught us, it is that being a minority can be very difficult. Especially when the ruling class has ideological differences with the minority. But have we only learned how to be an oppressive majority? Or are we capable of running a free, open society where orthodox Judaism can thrive alongside other ways of life?</p>
<p>I fear that the orthodox Jews who want to create orthodox Jewish cities are struggling with this. We know how to survive very well when others are in charge. Can we meet the challenge of autonomy without creating the same problems for others that we suffered throughout this exile?</p>
<p>I understand that the fear of charedi rule is mostly a fear of extremists. But the extremists are no longer so extreme. The basic standards of life in the charedi world may have been considered extreme 40 or 50 years ago. But now they are standards. Clearly, things are moving in a certain direction. The voice of moderation needs to be heard and the extremists must be silenced. If we do that, we have a chance at creating a united Jerusalem and other other towns, villages and cities as well, that are dominantly charedi but welcoming to all.</p>
<p>If we fail, I can foresee a time where non-charedim, like regular American orthodox Jews, won&#8217;t be welcome in our holiest of places because of our more moderate standards. Imagine waiting 2000 years to return to Jerusalem, only to be denied by our own brothers (and sisters). That would be a tragedy that we must avert.</p>
<p>Thank you Time Magazine for starting the conversation.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about visiting Israel is the diversity of Jewish people, practices and customs. In particular, the Kotel is a special place for so many Jewish people and even non-Jewish people. I always marvel at the beauty of the stones and all the people there to soak in their glory.</p>
<p>The only shul that I know of that rivals the Kotel in diversity is the <a href="pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Shul on the Beach</a> where I am the rabbi. It really is remarkable. It is not quite the diversity of the Kotel, but Pacific Jewish Center is probably a slightly distant second.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some people who do not value diversity. Some people desire uniformity in action, thought and dress. The latest victim of this attitude was chronicled in a recent AP article.</p>
<p>The Israeli rabbinate has proclaimed that the Ethiopian Jewish community religious leaders, called kessoch, no longer be recognized by the State of Israel. The control over who is recognized as a legitimate spiritual leader in Israel is in the hands of the Rabbinate.<span id="more-5067"></span></p>
<p>At this point, most, if not all of the kessoch have abandoned their traditional dress and now conform to the standard of Ashkenazik rabbis who wear dark suits, white shirts and black hats. Traditionally, the kessoch worse turbans and clothing that is appropriate for a community with roots in North Africa.</p>
<p>Some of their customs were already abandoned when they emigrated to Israel. These were customs that varied greatly from the practiced version of orthodox Judaism in Israel. But now, they are being forced to completely assimilate into the dominant version of Judaism in Israel.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of whether or not the Ethiopian Jews are legitimate. The working assumption is that they have converted if necessary and are now full-fledged Jews. The issue is that once they are Jews, they are not being permitted to have official rabbis who hail from their communities. These communities were self regulated and ruled for hundreds and hundreds of years. Now, they are being forced to give that up.</p>
<p>I find it sad and ironic the Jews are forcing assimilation on other Jews.</p>

<p><span>Over <span>Pesach</span>, the NY Times featured a front page article about <span>Kiryas</span> Joel, the <span>Satmar</span> enclave in Upstate New York. See: </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/nyregion/kiryas-joel-a-village-with-the-numbers-not-the-image-of-the-poorest-place.html?scp=1&amp;sq=kiryas%20joel&amp;st=cse" target="_blank"><span><span>Kiryas</span> Joel, N.Y., Lands Distinction as Nation&#8217;s Poorest Place</span></a>.</p>
<p><span>It received minimal attention on the blogs because of its timing. Had it been during a peak blogging season I am sure it would have been the talk of the town. As it was, the article raised some very important issues about <span>Kiryas</span> Joel, welfare in <span>Chassidus</span>, welfare in general and <span>Chassidus</span> in general.</span></p>
<p><span>First, the facts. The poorest place in America with a population of more than 10,000 is <span>Kiryas</span> Joel. KJ is a community that is exclusively <span>chassidic</span> and overwhelmingly <span>Satmar</span>. The second poorest place is a distance speck in the rear view mirror statistically. KJ claims a nearly 70% poverty rate and the second poorest place, Athens Ohio has a 56% poverty rate. The distance between the two is astronomical.</span><span id="more-4200"></span></p>
<p>However, KJ is more like suburbia than a typical poverty stricken neighborhood. Nice late model cars are parked in front of upscale stores, women push nice new strollers and there is virtually no street crime. The more affluent members of the community help their poorer neighbors out with free loans and charity. No one goes hungry. The funds are funneled through the religious leadership of the community as are almost all communal matters.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the generosity is admirable. The sense of trust and connection between members of the community is special and should be commended.</p>
<p><span>On the other hand, some of the ex-<span>chasids</span> in <span>Unchosen</span> see it differently. It is their belief that the leadership of KJ and similar enclaves purposely keep their communities poor. The leadership uses it as a way of asserting their control over the community. People who are uneducated, making little money and with little transferable skills make for good zombie soldiers.</span></p>
<p>The leadership of the community maintains control over the services for the community so if you want a bite of the apple you need to walk the walk. Not only are financial benefits tied to good standing in the eyes of the leadership of the community, but their opinion of you will determine many other social benefits that are bestowed upon members of the community in good standing. Good recommendations for potential spouses requires their approval as well.</p>
<p>One is not permitted to question the system, the leaders or the ideals. The leaders set the rules and there is no room for question or dissent. One opinion, one set of rules, one way of life period.</p>
<p>I believe this kind of leadership is fascist. This is not democracy. It is a dictatorship. It is a communist regime. It is a stark reminder that absolute power, absolutely corrupts.</p>
<p>Oppressing people so that they will be obedient is downright evil. Requiring them to live by an arbitrary set of rules and regulations and cutting them off if they don&#8217;t is a travesty.</p>
<p>If these allegations are true, the leadership of these communities is responsible and reprehensible. That is the worst case scenario. The best case scenario is that the leadership does not realize that this is the result of their choices. But that makes the situation no less dire.</p>
<p><span>For most people living in these communities there is no way out. They rely on their neighbors and friends for everything and they are severely limited in their ability to earn a living outside the community. They speak <span>english</span> as a second language and have below high school level educations.</span></p>
<p><span>The sad irony is that chassidus was created to give everyone an opportunity to connect with the spiritual and religious. It was the everyman Judaism. Today , in some places, [and let me be clear, this is about specific isolated enclaves,] it has been relegated to a cult of blind adherence to leaders who inherited their positions from their fathers or pay the price. This is not what chassidus was supposed to be.</span></p>
<p><span>That is something even a non-<span>chasid</span> like me can get upset by.</span></p>
<p><em>(Tomorrow this will be discussed in the context of the recent arson incident in New Square)</em></p>

<p>This week we got back on track and started Chapter 9.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this was one of the best Mesillas Yesharim classes to date. The Ramchal was so insightful and I shared an insight of my own which I think is very poignant. It all goes back to Adam and Eve being ousted from the Garden of Eden.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Last week we talked about the Healthcare plan that was ratified by the house the night before.

This week we got back on track and started Chapter 9.

In my opinion, this was one of the best Mesillas Yesharim classes to date. The Ramchal was so insightful and I shared an insight of my own which I think is very poignant. It all goes back to Adam and Eve being ousted from the Garden of Eden.

<p>What was short on time was long on content. The end of the Seventh Chapter of Mesillas Yesharim contains what I find to be the most profound insight in the entire text.</p>
<p>We all are familiar with the common idea that if &#8220;one doesn&#8217;t feel &#8216;it'&#8221; we don&#8217;t feel comfortable acting that in way. We even call people who act in a way not consonant with their feelings hypocrites. The Ramchal has a completely different perspective and I strongly recommend listening to today&#8217;s class.</p>

<p>However, we got no further in the text of Mesillas Yesharim this week.</p>
<p>Instead we had a truly invigorating discussion ab0ut &#8220;seriousness&#8221;. It is tough for us to relate to this section Mesilas Yesharim. We are allowed to make jokes, frivoility is not ALWAYS bad, so how can we bring this section down to earth and make is relevant?</p>
<p>One example that I cited for a moment as we began class was the way observant Jews typically dress. Have you ever wondered why observant Jews dress conservatively for the most part or wear &#8220;black and white&#8221;?</p>
<p>Much of what we talk about was related to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/" target="_blank">this post</a>, as well as these <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/13/clothes-in-the-nba/" target="_blank">posts</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/05/clothing-round-up/" target="_blank">this post</a> as well.</p>

<p>Ramchal gives us 3 things to avoid. We began the first of these today.</p>
<p>During the class we had 3 really great discussion.</p>
<p>Our first discussion was about the distance from our heads to our hearts and Tefillin.</p>
<p>The second discussion was about working for a living. The Torah approach is that one should earn a living to take care of our material needs and set aside time for Torah study to take care of our spiritual needs.</p>
<p>We ended with a lengthy discussion about absolute truth. Our Rabbis teach us that one can only become righteous and moral if they study Torah. What is the meaning behind this? Why is intellectual information a prerequisite for moral growth?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we began the 4th Chapter of Messilas Yesharim.</p>
<p>The 4th Chapter deals with the method by which we can acquire the very useful characteristic of Zehirus (watchfulness). The fist step in the process is study of Torah. By studying sections of Torah that deal with inspiration and motivation we can give ourselves a much needed boost. This is in addition to the inspiration which comes standard with any Torah study. Ramchal first talks about the type of person who has already acquired much Torah and cares desperately about living his life the fullest. He needs little motivation to be vigilant in his Zehirus &#8211; he already cares passionately about using his time well. This serves as his inspiration. It is the fear of not succeeding that drives him.</p>
<p>Next week we will learn about Ramchal&#8217;s method advice for those of us still lacking in the Torah study department.</p>
<p>We enjoyed a nice discussion about the fear of failure as well.</p>

Ramchal first talks about the type of person who has already acquired much Torah and cares desperately about living his life the fullest. He needs little motivation to be vigilant in his Zehirus - he already cares passionately about using his time well. This serves as his inspiration. It is the fear of not succeeding that drives him.

Next week we will learn about Ramchal&#039;s method advice for those of us still lacking in the Torah study department.

We enjoyed a nice discussion about the fear of failure as well.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we completed the 3rd chapter of Messilas Yesharim.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous of Ramchal&#8217;s ideas is present in this week&#8217; section. I won&#8217;t ruin it for you so you will need to check it out for yourself&#8230;</p>
<p>As we completed the section we talked about practical applications of &#8220;Zehirus&#8221; and in what ares we need watchfulness. We are not rehabilitating murders, thieves and rapists in our class so where is the moral struggle for which we need watchfulness? As a group we discussed following our intellect over our instinct and areas where that may be helpful.</p>
<p>We also briefly mentioned the idea that when we make good choices they can become instinctive as well &#8211; but that is an acquired instinct resulting from our good choices. The bad instinct is the &#8220;child&#8221; within us that is selfish and is reminiscent of animal instinct.</p>
<p>What we are learning about is how to stop the child instinct from controlling us. Then we make good choices which in turn become instinctual&#8230; And that is a good thing!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well it has been one month for me on the blogging trail. I must say, I quite like it. I like the idea of expressing myself to an infinite (sometimes reluctant) audience. If the world stops being interesting to me then the blog posts will probably end.
