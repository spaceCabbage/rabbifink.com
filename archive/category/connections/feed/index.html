				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prayer is something so basic to all faiths and religions. Jewish ideas of prayer are decidedly different from other cultures. It is very important to learn about the Jewish approach to prayer.</p>
<p>I began the class by announcing that this was a topic I longed to discuss for a very long time. I finally felt that the time was right.</p>
<p>We asked all the basic questions about prayer. We asked some advanced questions about prayer.</p>
<p>Using ideas from Rabbi Chaim Volozhin and others we pieced together a rational approach to prayer that made sense to us.</p>
<p>It was a very exciting class with outstanding participation and a very alert listening audience.</p>
<p>I really recommend giving this class a listen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The third and final class in a very exciting series concluded our preparations for Shavuos.</p>
<p>Catch up by listening to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/05/structure-and-philosophy-of-torah-connections-5409/" target="_blank">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/12/structure-and-philosophy-of-torah-2-connections-5409/" target="_blank">Part 2</a>.</p>
<p>Today we sought to resolve the burning question we began our series with. Why is Talmud study the focus of Torah scholarship? Why do Yeshiva students spend the bulk of their time studying Talmud? Why is Talmud our connection to the Oral Law transmission?</p>
<p>Those questions plus much more are covered in this week&#8217;s class.</p>

<p>This week <a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php" target="_blank">Connections</a> was the second of a series of classes about the history, philosophy, structure and benefits to Torah study.</p>
<p>In preparation for Shavuos, when the Jewish people accepted the Torah, this was the perfect time for the series.</p>
<p>Tonight we did a quick review of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/05/structure-and-philosophy-of-torah-connections-5409/" target="_blank">last week</a>, though <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/05/structure-and-philosophy-of-torah-connections-5409/" target="_blank">listening online</a> would be a better option.

<p>Our journey this week took us from the writing of the <a href="http://www.torah.org/learning/basics/primer/torah/mishna.html" target="_blank">Mishna</a> through the the beginnings of the formation of the Talmud.</p>
<p>There was a great discussion about &#8220;machlokes&#8221; and the differing opinions among <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=59&amp;letter=T" target="_blank">Tanaic and Amoraic</a> literature.</p>

<p>For many people Israel serves as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East, for others it is a Jewish homeland where no Jew will be denied access, for others it holds tremendous historical value, there are others who cherish its spiritual significance and there are yet others who pine for the elevated Torah study of the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>Our goal was to find the meaning of the Land of Israel and its connection to the Jewish people from the Torah. We went to the source to find why there is an intrinsic connection between the Jewish people and the land of Israel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week at Connections we talk about clothes. Apparently clothes have been on my mind a lot. If you have been reading the blog you may have noticed that the recent posts all had to do with clothes. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/" target="_blank">I commented on the espn.com article </a>about wearing pants while playing basketball and then <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/" target="_blank">I commented on the President&#8217;s dress code</a>. While I was preparing for the Torah learning portion of <a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php" target="_blank">Connections</a> this week I was drawn to <a href="http://www.beingjewish.com/mitzvos/tzitzis.html" target="_blank">Tzitzis</a>.</p>
<p>We talked about clothing and the Torah&#8217;s associations with clothing. From Adam to Joseph to Saul we find a lot of negativity surrounding their clothing. What do I mean? Well you will have to listen to find out&#8230;</p>
<p>We learned about the numbers 6, 7 and 8 in Judaism and eventually we got to Tzitzis. We learned how Tzitzis can help us avoid the danger zone associated with clothing. There was an in depth treatment of how Tzitzis are made and what their construction requirements teach us.</p>
<p>We also talked about the difference between the Nazi form of Anti-Semitism and the Ancient Greek form of Anti-Semitism. The Ancient Greeks wanted us <em>to be like them</em> and forget Torah. The Nazis wanted us destroyed <em>because we not</em> like them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nowhere is the statement &#8220;you are what you eat&#8221; more true than in Judaism.</p>
<p>Our topic tonight was the dietary laws of the Torah. Tonight we dispelled many of the myths about kosher. We discussed the origins of the English word Kosher and contrasted that to the Hebrew word for Kosher.</p>
<p>Kosher is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest" target="_blank">survival of the fittest</a>. The fittest food for human consumption. Fit in the sense that it is good for your soul. Soul Food.</p>
<p>We got pretty deep into understanding why food is so important in Judaism and how some of the dietary rules help us avoid &#8220;danger zones&#8221;.</p>
<p>The discussion ranged from <a href="http://www.boardgames.com/chutandlad.html" target="_blank">chutes and ladders </a>to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sciatica" target="_blank">sciatica</a>. (no kidding)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well it has been one month for me on the blogging trail. I must say, I quite like it.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had such a nice program tonight. The event was sponsored by Elizabeth Liber as she moves to New York to attend <a href="http://www.yu.edu/stern/" target="_blank">Stern College</a>. Thank you for your sponsorship and we will miss you!</p>
<p>Our topic tonight was Inspiration. Much of our discussion was rooted in R&#8217; Akiva Tatz&#8217;s distillation of some very profound ideas. The main idea revolves around the numbers one, two and three. Listen to the class to find out just what that means! We learned more about the secrets behind the splitting of the sea, why food spoils, how to make a marriage work and &#8220;coping&#8221; with the load of our daily lives. There was some really great input from the attendees including some science, geometry and philosophical thoughts.</p>
<p>All in all the class was exciting, the questions were thought provoking and everyone in attendance had a really nice time. It makes the preparation and delivery worth the effort when the attendees are so engaging and positive.</p>
<p>I hope you will <a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php" target="_blank">join us next Monday night for our next &#8220;Connections&#8221;</a> we would love to see you there!<a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php" target="_blank"><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Liss did a tremendous job organizing and preparing the annual PJC Chanukah Party.</p>
<p>The kids and adults had a great time and we all thank Jeff for a job well done.</p>
<p>Tonight was a Connections night and I was on the program and I had to compete with the magician upstairs&#8230;</p>
<p>The question posed was as follows. The more significant miracle of Chanukah is the victory of the Maccabees over the Greeks in the physical and spiritual war in which they found themselves. There was another miracle of a small jug of oil lasting 8 days instead of 1 day. Why is the mitzvah of Chanukah to light candles connected to the miracle of the oil which is less important than the war? Why don&#8217;t we commemorate the war with a mitzvah? Secondly, why was a miracle of oil necessary? God does not just show off His abilities to perform miracles, there must a reason why the oil needed to last until new pure oil was available&#8230; What was so important about the oil burning for 8 days?</p>
<p>By the end of the talk we had answered those questions and touched on some relevant topics. Including the special qualities of fire and how to win a moral war in a spiritual wasteland.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

The kids and adults had a great time and we all thank Jeff for a job well done.

Tonight was a Connections night and I was on the program and I had to compete with the magician upstairs...

The question posed was as follows. The more significant miracle of Chanukah is the victory of the Maccabees over the Greeks in the physical and spiritual war in which they found themselves. There was another miracle of a small jug of oil lasting 8 days instead of 1 day. Why is the mitzvah of Chanukah to light candles connected to the miracle of the oil which is less important than the war? Why don&#039;t we commemorate the war with a mitzvah?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was sent this link by PJC member Judd Magilnick.</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell is a great writer and has had a great influence on my thinking. Perhaps the greatest secular influence on me of all! I have not yet had a chance to read his new book &#8220;Outliers&#8221; however I have read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/opinion/16brooks.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=gladwell&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">this NY Times OP-ED piece.</a></p>
<p>I am not necessarily agreeing with the writer&#8217;s assessment of Gladwell&#8217;s position rather I am commenting on the writer&#8217;s position in relationship to &#8220;Perfection&#8221;.</p>
<p>The astute will notice that this is exactly the point we made in our &#8220;Perfections&#8221; discussion. Success in not predetermined, it is our hands and our task to be vigilantly improving ourselves. Of course there are elements that are outside of our control such as location of birth, IQ, default personality traits etc. but none of those can stand in the face of our will to succeed!</p>
<p>I guess Malcolm Gladwell (in the writer&#8217;s view) and Rabbi Akiva will have to just agree to disagree&#8230;</p>
