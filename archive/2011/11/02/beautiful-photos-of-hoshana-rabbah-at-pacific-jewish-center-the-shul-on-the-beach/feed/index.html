		<description><![CDATA[Susan Barnes said, &quot;In my experience, women show up when they feel they are truly welcome.&quot;

With due respect, Rabbi, I cannot help but feel that the practice of your synagogue has established a vicious circle, and I hope that you and your congregation will reconsider.  Seeing the photos of the men in the Hoshanot procession walking right through the women&#039;s section made me feel that a woman&#039;s presence anywhere in the sanctuary on that day would be regarded as an intrusion.  I agree with Susan, and would not feel welcome to attend a Hoshana Rabbah service in your synagogue.

In addition, there&#039;s another problem that you might wish to consider.  Several years ago, an Orthodox female colleague of mine told me that she no longer goes to Simchat Torah services because, now that she&#039;s no longer living at home and is still unmarried, there would be no one for her to watch.  I think that Hoshana Rabbah can pose a similar challenge for traditional women.  After all, if a woman doesn&#039;t have her own lulav and etrog and/or can&#039;t participate in a Hoshanot procession, she might feel that she might just as well stay home and davven bi-y&#039;chidut/pray alone.  In my opinion, if you don&#039;t encourage the women to buy their own lulavim and etrogim, you are passively encouraging them to do things the way they&#039;ve always been done.  While the women with young children might find attending Shacharit/Morning Service on Hoshana Rabbah a bit challenging, you might find that women who don&#039;t have children or whose children have &quot;grown and flown&quot; would be happy to attend such an interesting and unusual service if they felt that they were truly participating and not simply getting in the way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for stopping by and commenting.

I do not encourage the men or the women. People do as they please.
If there was enough interest we would discuss the pros and cons and make a decision with the people involved.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I got it from &quot;It was an interesting time to take pictures but hardly a “typical day” in the life of an orthodox Jew.&quot; - Looks like I misread it. Sorry about that.

I wonder why none of the women showed up. Maybe that&#039;s something you would want to explore. In my experience, women show up when they feel they are truly welcome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am curious to know whether the women of your congregation are encouraged to acquire their own lulav and etrog sets, and whether, if women were present, a Torah scroll would be passed to their side of the mechitzah so that they could do the hoshanot circles in the women&#039;s section.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No this is not a typical day for an orthodox Jew. I don&#039;t know where you got that from.

And women were invited. None showed up.

It&#039;s not nice to make snap judgments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is supposed to be a typical day in the life of an Orthodox Jew? Maybe it&#039;s a typical holiday for Orthodox male Jews in the synagogue. Judging by the pictures, it looks like there is no such thing as an Orthodox Jewish woman. Once again, the women have been rendered invisible.]]></description>
