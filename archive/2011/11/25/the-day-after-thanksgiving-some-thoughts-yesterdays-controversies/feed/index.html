		<description><![CDATA[Halal Turkeys: It&#039;s about time we all started thinking clearly about our relationships with Muslims, especially outside the Middle East. It&#039;s probably true that most Muslims in Western countries harbor some degree of opposition to Israel and/or hostility to Jews. The right thing to do about that is to fight back by challenging any anti-Israel or antisemitic messages and not by trying to make a special case that Muslims are not entitled to the same rights as everyone else in a Western society.


Leaving aside the moral issue (and I think you would need much more pressing reasons to suspend civil liberties like freedom of contract than the fact that you don&#039;t like Muslims) it&#039;s crazy for one minority (Jews) to attempt to undermine the rights of another minority (Muslims). Were we to succeed we would be opening the door to potential persecution on ourselves.]]></description>
