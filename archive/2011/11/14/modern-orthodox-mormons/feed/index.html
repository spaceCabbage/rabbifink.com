		<description><![CDATA[FYI - I am LDS, and I have many non-Mormon friends whom I love every bit as much as my Mormon friends. And, for the record, I do not try to convert them....... &quot;By their fruits shall ye know them...&quot;. My friends (of all faiths) know what kind of person I am. If they have questions, they freely ask, and I answer. I do not pressure my friends to be like me. I love them for who they are, and they feel the same about me. Please understand, i am not trying to be a snob, but I hope you will understand that not all Mormons &quot;try to convert&quot; their friends.                                                                                                                              Have a wonderful day !!!!!

		<description><![CDATA[Firstly, Mormons do consider themselves to be Christians. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day-Saints is the official label. Secondly, Mormons are much more mainstream than Orthodox Jews. Yes, they wear &quot;garments&quot; if they have gone through the temple, but that is perhaps 80% of Mormons, not all. And not drinking is the goal, but as most Mormons know, it is only the goal, like abstinence of sex before marriage is the goal. It is hardly a given. What&#039;s very different is Jews do not try to convert people, in fact they are hesitant to allow conversions whereas Mormons are constantly on the make, trying to convert others. What is very similar is they are separate from mainstream emotionally. Non-Mormons are the &quot;other&quot; and are not sought in friendship or society unless needed or required. If a Mormon befriends a non-Mormon, you can be sure they are trying to convert them, eventually. But yes, the overall gist of your article is accurate, there is an &quot;otherness&quot; to both religions and an old-fashioned quality to their everyday living.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interestingly, in Mormon areas of the US, the word &quot;Gentile&quot; has historically meant a non-Mormon.  There are also &quot;Jack Mormons,&quot; which is the Mormon equivalent of Reform, and &quot;Molly Mormons,&quot; which is the Mormon equivalent of a Haredi woman.  Interestingly, there have been several articles about former Utah Governor and Presidential candidate Jon Huntsman, viewing him as a Jack Mormon or &quot;Reform Mormon&quot; and suggesting why  less religious Jews may be comfortable with him: http://forward.com/articles/143534/   http://www.getreligion.org/2011/08/is-jon-huntsman-a-jack-mormon/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I joined the Mormon church 37 year ago at age 24. Before that time, I was quite worldly. Today, I work for Hewlett Packard and see no problem fitting into society. Certain social activities may be an acception. For example, I tend to avoid activities where people are wearing immodest clothes, drinking large amounts of alchohol, using crude language or watching movies that are beneath my standards.

Other than obvious things such as not drinking, smoking, swearing, etc., I feel like I fit into society better than many. In many ways, the Mormon church is on the cutting edge of society. The church promotes education, good careers, family life as equals between men and women, being involved in governent and the community and a balanced life of service and wholesome recreational activities. The church is down on family abuse and unhealthy practices. The church is a mix of modernity mixed with down home traditional values. 

Having grown up in a heavily protestant culture (I have ministers in my family), Mormonism feels like the cutting edge of religion. The leaders of the Mormon church from the bottom to the top are not folks with religious degrees. They were called out of society. Many of the top leaders were called out of lucrative positions to serve the rest of their lives in the church where there is no paid clergy. The quorum of the 12 apostles includes a state supremene court judge, a famous sergeon, a prominant physicist, 2 college presidents, and some leaders in industry.

The church uses  practical and professional practices to take the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world. To me, it is the cadillac of Christinity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not drinking alcohol is not a big deal these days. I rarely drink alcohol (because, for the most part, I don&#039;t like it). I don&#039;t get any flak about it, and nobody has ever asked me if it is for religious reasons. I think it helps that people are more aware of alcoholism, so if someone doesn&#039;t drink, they may assume the person is in recovery, and they don&#039;t make a big deal out of it.]]></description>
