		<description><![CDATA[Do you want real answers? Ok. Here we go.

&#062;&#062;Is it true that the Talmud calls Jesus a son of a whore and states that he is in hell boiling alive in a vat of human excrement?
Unclear. The Talmud does speak of a certain apostate who was the son of a whore, and who might be boiling alive in excrement, but even Jewish authorities don&#039;t agree about who it was. The passage may refer to Jesus, but there are serious problems with the claim. Its really ambiguous. See here: http://talmud.faithweb.com/articles/jesusnarr.html

&#062;&#062;Is it true that according to the talmud it is acceptable to have intercourse with a 4 year old girl because the virginity will grow back?

No, that&#039;s not what the Talmud says. See here for the actual passage, and the intended meaning. http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/three.html

Any other questions? ]]></description>

I ask you this rabbi because you make repeated reference to &quot;his God&quot; which implies that you worship a different God, one whose true identity and nature is pretty obvious given the filth contained in &quot;your&quot; talmud. ]]></description>

Are you kidding? If someone put up a public Muslim religious display, you can bet there will be plenty of criticism from the right!]]></description>

And I am religious and not on the right. So what does that make me?

Find me a secular on the right...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi, please, a little common sense &#038; wisdom  and less with the intellectualism. I&#039;m not saying every liberal is anti-christian. I am saying when there is anti-christian sentiment, or offense is taken by anything as subtle as a christmas tree, it tends to be greater from the left. Just like the left tends to be the ones objecting to Judaism in Israel. In any country, leftism tends to rid itself of the shackles of its religion. It&#039;s a competing value system. There is a wonderful book by Eliezer Berkowitz  where in one chapter he discusses the left ridding itself of the &quot;Christian ethos&quot; of sexuality of the 60s. (just as an example that came into my head). 

You want to say the right is all religious? Fine. So then I will say, the left is all secular. Fine? Hence the rift.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, thank you for taking the time to post this Rabbi. Great topic!

Is there any difference between the way Tim Tebow publicly expresses his religious convictions (Christian) and Sandy Koufax (Jewish) expressing his?  Sandy refused to play in game one of the World Series, due to Yom Kippur in 1965? I&#039;m sure a lot of fans would have rather he pitched the game and thanked G-d for every strikeout.

I would actually say today&#039;s society is less tolerable of Christianity, more so than any other religion. It has become taboo in most respects to publicly share or express Christian beliefs. To say, Merry Xmas to anyone is now a federal offense. In today&#039;s America, I would argue, we find find ourselves at the other end of the spectrum. A place where it&#039;s acceptable to openly criticize Christianity and it is in no way regarded as off limits.  

If a Muslim athlete refuses to take part in the National Anthem prior to sporting events, it is not acceptable to question the motives. I have much more concern over this than I do with TT thanking Jesus for blessing him with uncommon athletic ability. 

As a Jew myself, I understand that this country was founded on Christian beliefs and theology. I&#039;m fine with that. This country gave my people a place to go when there was nowhere else to go. Thankfully the founding fathers (I&#039;m sure Christian in belief) were wonderful enough to create a country where all are accepted and viewed as equals. Perhaps we ought to acknowledge this kindness &#038; accept thier beliefs, without question or biased. Hasnt that played a big role in what has made this country great? I thank G-d this is a country of G-d fearing men &#038; women, Christian or otherwise, that came to the rescue of our people in a time of need. These people have stood by us ever since. And they have done so in a lot of primarily because their Christian beliefs. 

I guess what I&#039;m trying to say is, I&#039;m pro-Christian. If they refuse to believe man came from monkeys or wish to believe Jesus was born on December 25th and died for thier sins... Fine by me. Feel free have to praise Jesus all you want with every touchdown Timmy T!!!

If anything, Tebow&#039;s a great role model for the youth and we need that right now. He walks the walk and talks the talk... That&#039;s a rare and beautiful quality in this world.

G-d bless Tebow :-)]]></description>

I hope he&#039;s asking God to help him play the best he can and to keep him and his teammates uninjured, rather than asking God to &quot;make&quot; his team win. Does it have an impact? Probably not, except for perhaps some internal psychic impact in some people.]]></description>
