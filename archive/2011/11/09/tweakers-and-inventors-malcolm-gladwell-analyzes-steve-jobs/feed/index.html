		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t say you are. I said you are &quot;on your way&quot;.  If it wasn&#039;t G-d&#039;s idea/belief/words why should we keep to them.  I am pointing out the danger in what you are saying.  You may not intend it but you are saying it.  I do think form reading your posts you do believe that some of the Torah was borrowed.  That being said, all you need is a some more negative influence from the culture you seem to want to be accepted by and you will come to allow a prohibition.  You are heading in a really dangerous direction, which I am sure you disagree with me about, but you need to stop yourself and do some introspection.  Look at where you came from, what your goals were as an eved hashem and ask  yourself if you are on the right track.   I am sure you will tell me something about me being better or self righteous or something along those lines so that what I am saying here shouldn&#039;t be taken to heart.  That is your choice not to think about what I am saying.  As a blogger I have read said all he is trying to do is get people to think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You keep on stating that G-d borrowed ideas form other sources and that not everything in Torah is original.  You claim the Rambam says such a thing about karbonos based on the culture of the time.  I would love to see the entire text of the Rambam where he says this. However the Rambam is to be interpreted, you are well on your way to writing off a prohibition because it was based on some culture at the time the Torah was given.  Why not allow gay marriage?  At the time the Torah was given the culture was anti gay.  Today&#039;s society is very accepting of it.  And for that matter ban karbonos, society today is not pro it and it is not expected of us.  It is even frowned upon by PETA and the likes.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have no idea where this conversation went in your mind. Here is how I understood it. 
EF: Sacrifices were borrowed from pagan tribes and tweaked by GD in the Torah for the Jewish people. 
CTS: 1) You are saying that GD didn&#039;t write the Torah!? 2) How can that be if the Torah preceded the world? 
EF: 1) GD did tell Moshe what to write in the Torah. I never said otherwise. 2) Gaonim and rishonim did not take statement about the Torah preceding the world literally. 
CTS: Please cite the sources.
EF: Sources provided.
CTS: Holding that ideas were borrowed from outside the Torah is &quot;reformed at best&quot;. 
EF: The Rambam held that way. I have no problem holding like the Rambam even if it by your definition of orthodox I am not orthodox. 
CTS: [Reiterated that I am a kofer]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have not said that they said anything unorthodox.  You have a habit of construing words to mean something different.  None of the sources you quoted state that G-d borrowed an idea from elsewhere.  G-d created all and nothing the Torah writes nor the ideas behind it are unoriginal. So, no G-d did not tweak anything.  The belief that G-d tweaked someone else&#039;s idea is unorthodox at best, kefira at worst.  
I don&#039;t have anything to ask mechila for, you might for trying to construe my word as attacking them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So you are saying that not everything in the Torah is original? I am sure the Rambam did not mean that, in light of the Torah predating creation.  You are clearly saying that not everything in the Torah is G-d&#039;s words, but someone else&#039;s that G-d borrowed. ]]></description>
