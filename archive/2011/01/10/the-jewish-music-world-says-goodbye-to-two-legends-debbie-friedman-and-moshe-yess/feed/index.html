		<description><![CDATA[I have never heard of Moshe Yess, but given what you say about Debbie&#039;s music and that her havdalah became part of your life, I will learn about Moshe Yess, since you obviously have a feel for modern Jewish music.  There were a number of events celebrating Debbie&#039;s life and music, but the one the moved me the most (and had the best quality recording for internet viewing, which probably had a lot to do with how moved I was, is at the website of Central Synagogue in Manhattan:  http://www.centralsynagogue.org/index.php/community_programs/of_note/remembering_debbie_friedman_zl/

It is well worth watching, despite whatever tears come your way.  You are right, of course, that those who leave so much behind will endure forever, and that will comfort the rest of us, particularly when her mishberach comes to mind.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Like you, I never heard of Debbie Friedman when I was growing up, and only sparsely since. I will definitely check out her music. And again, like you, I definitely heard of Moshe Yess. I was a huge Megama fan and remember meeting Shalom Levine through a family member. I haven&#039;t heard Moshe&#039;s music in years, but remember it very fondly. It was unique. Nothing else in the Jewish music world has had that style. He will be missed.

And Moshe made us laugh
And Moshe made us sing
And Moshe made us music every night

		<description><![CDATA[Like you, I never heard of Debbie Friedman yet I am sure that her influence will be forever enduring. However, I am shocked by the passing of Moshe Yess. He is one of my favorite Jewish Music personalties. Loved his tones and style of his music and singing. I was ever so displeased when his voice did not surface on the Journey&#039;s IV album. My son is obsessed with Dr. Middos and my favorite songs (the only ones I am not already sick of) are the ones sung by Moshe Yess. I was also a big fan of Shlock Rock which if I remember correctly (its been some time since I have listened to that album) was a Moshe Yess production. May his family be comforted amongst the mourners of Zion. ]]></description>
