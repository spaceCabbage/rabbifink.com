		<description><![CDATA[I read this quite a while ago, so I don&#039;t remember enough of the specifics to comment very intelligently, but I do remember that I disliked it.  I just couldn&#039;t get over the negative feelings brought up by the conversion to Christianity, and by her deep religious feeling as a Christian.  It wasn&#039;t so much that I blamed her for becoming a good Christian - obviously her childhood in her Jewish family had been horrible. But it struck me as terribly sad and depressing  that there was nothing left for her in Judaism besides the memories of her abusive father.  (Again, not something that was her fault, but still sad.)  I couldn&#039;t find anything inspiring about her life after she left Judaism  - it was just depressing that this was the only option she saw.
And the reason I can&#039;t go back and check the specifics is that the book depressed me so much it was one of the few books I&#039;ve read that I ever sold to a used bookstore.  I just didn&#039;t want it around.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved the book.  As a Jew, it was something hard to read about the things that drove her away and the obvious devotion to Christianity, but it&#039;s a lesson in the importance of love and acceptance.  Rachel/Ruth&#039;s mother was her bond with Judaism, and her father was the force driving her out.  When her mother died, so did her attachment to Judaism.
