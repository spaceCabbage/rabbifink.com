		<description><![CDATA[Karma is a much more intricate concept than even LeBron James is aware.  The common misconception of Karma is that there is a direct correspondence between your actions now and your fate.  This is a gross oversimplification.

Here is the basic breakdown.  Karma is the big picture, usually portrayed as a giant wheel.  In each incarnation, you have a certain Dharma (duty) you must fulfill.  What your Dharma is depends on your position on the wheel.  To sum it up, if you fulfill your Dharma, then when you die, you move forward; if you don&#039;t fulfill your Dharma, you move backwards.  Thus the caste system in India: they believe that if you are born of a lower class, it&#039;s because of Karma, so there is no mobility of classes there.  

Of course, I&#039;m grossly oversimplifying it.  Each of the different religions has its unique twist on this.  To some, the ultimate goal is enlightenment (Makhsha), to some it&#039;s breaking free (Nirvana).  But the important thing is that the soul is in constant communion, and that in the Karmic system, you may very well be repenting for sins that previous incarnations committed.  Of course, the Mickey Mouse definition that is constantly thrown around hardly ever takes this into account.  And hey, it made for an interesting plot device in &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot; when Earl heard that great sage Carson Daly claim that he&#039;s as successful as he is because of Good Karma, and decided to start being good to people so he could be like Carson Daly.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[no i wouldnt care b/c he plays basketball. and basketball is a game for ppl with ADD. its dumb. i havent watched a full game in years and probably wont ever again....

he has redeeming qualities as he is a skilled player of a game that some ppl watch (lord only knows why). but the fact is this tweet was obviously aimed at gilbert and no one else. i think thats clear and i dont even follow basketball...

but im happy he came here, it helps our local economy...]]></description>
