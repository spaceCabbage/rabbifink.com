		<description><![CDATA[Mosque Protests


 


Ms. Young asserts that the protests against the Ground Zero
mosque were ‘rife with vitriol toward all of Islam.’  She sites as the principal example of this
vitriol the fact that such conservative luminaries as Newt Gingrich and Rush
Limbaugh compared the Ground Zero mosque to the construction of ‘a Ku Klux Klan memorial at Gettysburg, a Japanese cultural center
at Pearl Harbor, or a Nazi sign next to the Holocaust Museum; each analogy
equating mainstream Muslims with murderous aggressors.’


 


A simpler explanation suggests itself.  The point of the comparisons was not to
equate all Muslims with murderous aggressors but to suggest that building the
Ground Zero mosque would demonstrate a similar example of insultingly bad taste
and breathtaking insensitivity as supporting a Japanese cultural center at Pearl Harbor. 


 


Critics who compare opposition to the mosque as equating
Muslims with murderous aggressors do have a point, however.  Imagine the reaction to a group of Reform
Jews desirous to build a Synagogue near the site of the massacre committed by
Baruch Goldstein.  Would anyone
continence their claim to be promoting religious coexistence in an open,
trusting and non-judgmental environment? 
Would anyone take seriously the defense that liberal Jews share as much
of the ideology of radical religious Zionism as Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf shares
with Al Quaeda?  Of course not.  Decency involves developing some sensitivity
to emotional reality and not simply making trite and meaningless
distinctions.  Good grief.       


 


 


Shariah Law


 


The Conservative’s concern with Shariah law is not with its
religious expression but with its political aspirations.  Ms. Young is correct to note the structural similarities
between Halacha and Sharia but she is misguided in the assumption that the
latter is objectionable merely as a codification of religious practice.  It is Shariah’s relationship to an
expansionist and totalitarian political ideology and its capacity to give
formalized expression to Jihad that raises Western concerns.


 


It is organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood that are at
the center of the debate over Shariah and political coercion. This
organization, tastefully outfitted in Western attire and conversant with the
language of political accommodation will prove seductive to individuals eager
to find political moderation in a region characterized by despotism, cruelty
and misogyny.  Resisting such seductions
will not be made easier by an inability to see Shariah as an expression of political
will rather than as an authority for religious custom.


 


The Myth of the
Muslim Monolith 


 


Ms. Young argues that it is Ilamophobics like Robert Spencer
and Michelle Malkin who are, along with Muslim extremists, create an obstacle
to reform and help undermine the spirit of tolerance necessary to Muslim
assimilation.  This comes perilously
close to the failed policy of political correctness that is plaguing Europe and implies both that Muslims are too sensitive to
respond rationally to religious criticism and that the absence of criticism
will help moderate the existing Jihadist subculture. Such ideas are not
evidence of a healthy culture confident in its assimilatory ability but rather
suggest a culture insecure in affirming its own values.  


 


The real problem is not the harsh criticism of Robert
Spencer but the unconscionable ignoring by the mainstream media of such Islamic
reformers as Dr. Hedieh Mirahmadi, Tarek Faah and Dr. Zuhdi Jasser.  These courageous individuals are in the
vanguard of Islamic moderates upholding the supremacy of Western political
values and are eloquent advocates for the distinction between political and
spiritual Islam.  That CAIR (an
organization that combines the worst of Jimmy Hoffa’s Teamsters with the best
of European high fashion) receives far more media attention then articulate
proponents of Islamic reform is another depressing reminder that among media
elites, devaluing the West is a sure ticket to professional advancement.      ]]></description>
