		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The investigation has shown clear errors on behalf of the frum community in repeated failures to see warning signs.&quot;  this was your reply.  Secondly, although I cannot cite the source, because it was on the radio, wcbs 880 quoted the police commissioner in response to people coming out and saying that there were other attempts that there were none.  That does not mean there were no warning signs.  There are always warning signs, it is a matter if we catch them.  Most of the time, we look back and say, &quot;oh, that was a warning sign&quot;.  It is like that with illnesses, marriages that fall apart, etc... We can always look back and kick ourselves for allowing something to happen by saying we should have caught it.  Your approach does just that by looking at the reasons for why it could have happened.  Instead we must head the wake up call and leave the debating on how or why it happened to those who are not interested in becoming more astute to our communities&#039; problems.
Our communities are structured as insular because we are fighting incredible forces that are drowning our people.  This is not putting our heads in the sand, it is a form of protection. It is a dangerous trade you are asking for, and a losing one at that.  But your stance is that orthodoxy benefited from reform, so it is not a far cry to say that orthodoxy will benefit form embracing the immoral culture (although I believe you agree this is quite different).  It is too dangerous to ask that we open our culture, rahter we must learn to fight the dangers we already have in our midst.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Claims of attempts by the murderer to pick up kids have been discredited.&lt;/i&gt;

No they haven&#039;t. http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/07/17/ny-man-charged-with-murder-boy-reportedly-had-history-strange-behavior/

I did not say there was &quot;clear error&quot;. I said that in a community where there is a long history of victimhood and evil is assumed to come from the &quot;outside&quot;, warning signs can be missed.

I did not blame.

Your last sentence is exactly what I said just explained why we may not realize it sometimes and how, perhaps, if we change the way our communities are structured, warning signs won&#039;t be missed in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Claims of attempts by the murderer to pick up kids have been discredited.  I am not saying there weren&#039;t warning signs at all, but there were none that would have alerted something of this nature.  The investigation did not show any clear signs of error on behalf of the frum community.  You call yourself an optimist yet you are focusing on many perceived ills of the frum community.  As an optimist you should be seeing the 90% full and good of the frum community not the 10% you perceive as having caused and/or permitted this to occur.  There is no need nor reason to blame, the takeaway is that our communities suffer from the same ills and we must wake up and deal with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reb Yisrael, thanks for stopping by.

The investigation has shown clear errors on behalf of the frum community in repeated failures to see warning signs.
No one made any accusations of criminal negligence.

I did not criticize Torah centers of the Jewish people. In fact I even provided a reasonable explanation for the current situation as it exists in the New York area. But it does exist and it is the cause of many social problems including an environment that may have contributed to this murder.

I believe modifying our general approach and lifestyle is a form of teshuva.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi-
I disagree with your takeaway from this episode. 
I assume there will be an investigation. At this point we should not be blaming people for ignoring &quot;warning signs.&quot; Nor should we be indulging in historical or sociological explanations for an &quot;anti-Semitism paranoia&quot; in support of unfounded accusations of criminal negligence.
This much is clear. The murderer is mentally ill and this tragedy is thus a &quot;natural disaster.&quot; According to the Rambam our response should be to do Teshuva, not criticize the Torah centers of the Jewish people.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still a little too raw to look for any good to come from this.

But if this is a teachable moment, one where the community can examine its behavior, and how to better protect itself and its children, well and good. I don&#039;t know. I was very upset by Shmuley Boteach&#039;s article on this, where he seems to be having trouble distinguishing between protecting children from &#039;corrupting social influences&#039; and protecting them from psychopathic killers.

But right now, I&#039;m not sure we really have all the information on what happened and what led up to this...and many an insular community has missed the killer in their midst before. I&#039;m not sure this is something that can be fully protected against, ever.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent response to an incomprehensible tragedy, Rabbi.  I worry, though, that the insular communities will, as a result of this, become even more reclusive, not only spurning the &quot;outside&quot; world but, as you allude, those in their midst who are not on the exact derech they seek.  Must every male there wear a white shirt?  Of course--but now not only the blue-shirt-wearers, but anyone earning the adjective &quot;creepy&quot; will likely draw suspicion.
Thank you for your blog, Rabbi. You are astute and articulate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;This is what I referred to when I wrote that there is a silver lining in dark cloud.&lt;/i&gt;

There is no good that can come out of such a senseless murder of a child (or of anyone). Sorry, no silver lining here. There&#039;s a reason Chazal said that killing a person is like killing the world.  
 
In fact, maybe more new evil will come out of this. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if Boro Park (and other places) starts to ostracize (I mean more than they already do) single men over age 30 especially if they are a little &quot;weird&quot;, nebachs, or just simply march to the beat of a different drummer. They could be entirely harmless having never harmed a person in their life, and not having the capability to maliciously harm another person, yet they may all be tarred with the same brush. Meanwhile, as usual, the Rebbe (with wife+7 kids) that molests will be reported to the nearest Gadol who will sweep it under the rug so the community &quot;doesn&#039;t look bad&quot; (bad for shidduchim, communal power brokers, etc).  
 
I&#039;m not going to bless evil things. I won&#039;t even bless any possible good that can come from evil things because that good should have been done without the evil thing occurring. And I surely won&#039;t bless anything about this particular evil thing. If our overly insular community repairs itself, maybe I&#039;ll bless the result, but I wouldn&#039;t deign to connect this evil act (in any way as good) with that positive action.]]></description>
