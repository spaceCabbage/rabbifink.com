		<description><![CDATA[What is really strange about this most horrifying story, something along the lines of jeffrey dommer, is that it was plastered all over the news until the murderer was found ???  What has happened to the story since????    Does it have anything to do with the fact that it was a jewish man within the community ????   I thought it was a hate crime when first reported.  Lessons could be learned here for everyone and it should be reported because being part of a religious community doesn&#039;t make one immune to this type of horrific crime and coverups will only create a false sense of security and easy prey for the most maniacal humans.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is not really reasonable. Shas and rishonim are clear one way. A rabbi should know that. And be presenting that. No more no less. you seem inept. I may email you offline sometime or may not. I am not sure. this whole thing is bizzarre. But your inablility to make clear points or address things with more than &quot;see your reading comprehension is of neener neener,&quot; like a child bespeaks your immaturity. Perhpas you will come of age sometime. Regarding the R. Miller approach, none of your inseciruty with authenticjudiasm and his lunacy should have anything to do with this. The fact that you are not at all in line with anyone who would be considered part of &quot;mainstream orthodox judiasm,&quot; is te reason you don&#039;t like the Rav Miller &quot;brand.&quot; you are at best modern orthodox, and in my opinion Reform. Today you disagree with the Rabbis of the talmud on the issue of women, and claim they are wrong. Tomorrow it will be something else - i think redefining &quot;mishkivei Isha,&quot; and you will say &quot;the rabbis of the talmud were wrong when they said that homosexuality was abhorrent. they thoguh it was, and that is understandable. but we know better. and the verse does not really indicate what they think.&quot; after all, you are not some sort of wacky conservative like your predecessor Lapin - no you are a liberal. a wonderous Obama-like vision of left-wing ness. This all seems to me the direction that you are going. And people that can not see this are truly blind.

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re really asking me to go and recruit the people who like me? Seriously?

Email me offline and I will give you some email addresses.

R&#039; AM was a great man. I don&#039;t have a problem with him. But his students have taken his approach and turned it into a brand of kanaus that is &quot;darchei noam&quot;.

As to your point, I disagree. The straightforward halacha is not-applicable when living amongst non-Jews, it is equally not relevant in determining attitudes. When the situation changes (ie Moshiach) my feelings will need to adjust.

But you see this is a reasonable disagreement. Not one borne out of ignorance, or ineptitude.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[how can you distinguish between theroy and practice? we are talking about feelings. in my world, it is a regrettable fact that a Jew has to help a non-Jew due to eiva. thats what the talmud and halacha say. it means that really we would not. and that tells us what we should think. we should think that though we ideally wouldnt do this, we must since otherwise it will cause eiva. isnt that straightfroward. I have lived in israel for years. But come on. Its a real place too. We are having children and granchildren here, going to dentists, having operations, making and losing money dealing with gentiles. please.  be serious. when talking aobut what one hsould think, shouldnt we look to the sources, rather than ignore them with a &quot;i look only at the 1/2 of the rambam that talks about practice&quot; and then in the next breath say &quot;so then i was wondering...&quot; about the very thing that you ignored? such silliness. i wonder if there are many people who really learn from you. I would be fascinated to hear a couple of them back you up here. people who could say, &quot;Rabib Fink is a Rabbi who teaches me torah and helps me connect to Hashem. He is knowledgeable and caring and intellectually honest.&quot; You seem like none of that to me. And finally - what is your problem with Rav Miller Zt&quot;l?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So in your (imaginary) world Jewish doctors don&#039;t treat non-Jews? Please.

Look, your IP address has you in Israel. You may not be aware of what America is like, but we live amongst non-Jews and your worldview just doesn&#039;t work here.

Further, your entire premise is flawed. There is eiva, there is darkei shalom. In practice one should save a non-Jew. So I focus on the practice not the theory.

I am certainly AWARE of the &quot;R&#039; Avigdor Miller brand of Judaism&quot;. I CHOOSE not to embrace it.

Also, I post a weekly shiur on this site. (I have been a bit lax lately, so I am a few weeks behind.) You are welcome to listen to those if it is Torah that you seek.

And I don&#039;t usually finish preparing my divrei Torah for Shabbos until Friday afternoon so it seems superfluous to post them at that late hour when it is shabbos already in every other Jewish community in the world.

If you&#039;d like, you can ask my shul members to say them over or I can email you the roshei teivos.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Can you explain how on earth kadima got brought up by the way? the mishna that thalks about the order to save people &quot;haish kodem lisha&quot; never mentions a gentile. that is a totoalyl differnt sction. its never permissible to save a gentile if not for eiva. where the heck did you get kadima from? [there are an overwhelming amount of sources that tell us not to care about the gentile. You know that. You must know how the rishonim write about he doctor who helped a gentiel woman give birth (yashar kochacha sheeata marbeh zaro shel amalek.) after all, it is brought by the nosei kelim on the tur and shulchan aruch, which you are quite knowledgable in. (sic) give us all a break. there are tens of sources, all readily available in the basic mussar sfarim, as well as in shas to tell us that we do not really care all that much about those people as compared to a Jewish soul. that a &quot;rabbi&quot; could be caught not knowing this sort of basic Jewish theology is devastating. A teacher of mine, Rabbi Avigdor Miller would say, when an ambulance would intterupt his shiur with it&#039;s siren, &quot;Hashem if that is a member of our nation, please grant him a speedy recovery.&quot; To know notihng about all this is sad. You certainly know about pop culture, television, movies, and all sorts of things other than Torah. It saddens me. I wonder what your father thinks bout all this. and why he does not defend you on the blogs ever, though he surely reads them. THat his material appears herein (honestly the only attempt at Torah in the las couple years on this blog at all) makes me think that he agrees with what you are doing. I know him. But that he could be party to this makes me sad.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[aaargh. you questioned whether it was ok to care more about a jewish tragedy than a goyish one. i tell you that it is an obligation to care about a Jew. And that you would not even be allowed, ever to prevent that from happening to a goyish person, except for eiva - which means the fear that they will wipe us out in a pogrom. and you answer with kadima, which was not really even mentioned in my comment? and then you just say &quot;you didnt read well.&quot; well, Rabbi - YOU did not read well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[you wrote &quot; At first I was disturbed. Do we care more about some poor Chasidish kids from Williamsburg than anyone else? Is this tragedy worse to us because they are Jewish? Aren’t we outraged when non-Jews do not care about Jewish tragedy as much as non-Jewish tragedy? Even if we are allowed to care more about a Jewish tragedy should we try and mask our feelings to be more politically correct? This has been gnawing at me for a little while now. Should we care more about a Jewish tragedy than a non-Jewish tragedy? Is this a good attitude? Could this bother non-Jews and provoke anti-semitism?
Or, perhaps it is normal for us to care more about our Jewish brethren. Maybe, we should feel more compassion for our fellow Jews. After all, it is a rule of Jewish law that we are responsible for one another. &quot; You ask questions that Jewish theology is clear about. We do not save the lives of Gentiles except for Eiva. Hashem values 1 Jew more than an entire nation of gentiles (see for example kli yakar to haazinu - yatzev gevulot amim). Hashem cares more about this one Jewish child than any goy in the world. That is the Talmud&#039;s take on this. If a Jew is drowning, and a goy is drowning, one must save the Jew, and let the goy drown. This is not cause of &quot;Jews are responsible.&quot; it is because it&#039;s forbidden to save the life of a gentile. I don&#039;t nesesarrily think that this is the first thing to present to people, though it is in talmud, rambam etc. But I do think that asking &quot;should we care more about Jews,&quot; as a question rather than a rhetorical one is wrong for a Rabbi. Its not what Torah judiasm teaches. Even if you could twist and turn and make religious christians into ger toshav - which is not simple, but some do, it still makes athiests, or anyone who has ever violated any of the 7 mitzvot at least once into this sort of Gentile. and a ger toshav is sure not a jew, or treated like one. We just save his life from drowning. mitzvah lihachyoto. Thats it. We give him the non kosher meat. no more. do you not see how taking the fact that a JEw is rightly more concerned with his fellow Jews plight, (for he would not ahve been permitted to save the life of that gentile  in that very plight if not for eiva) and questioning it is a terrible perversion of Torah.  do you actually need a lesson in the soruces about how one must love Jews, and the value of their blood in comparison to others? its not ok. it bothers me. I don&#039;t comment that much, as you see, since you never manage to see anyone elses view at all. But hopefully, others can see you for the fraud that you are.]]></description>
