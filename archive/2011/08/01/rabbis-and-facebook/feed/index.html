		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the advice.

Of the several hundred people who read this post, the 2 dozen who &quot;liked&quot; it on Facebook,several who tweeted it on Twitter, you were the only 2 who took any issue with it. It&#039;s a bit presumptuous to say &quot;it&#039;s all lost on the public&quot;. Don&#039;t you think?

I will try harder to be less emotional. But I don&#039;t mind admitted that I have an agenda. Of course I do. Everyone does. And if I didn&#039;t why would I be blogging?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eliyahu- Whether you are right or wrong is now irrelevant. Look at what comments your post caused. No one cares any more about the content of your post, the conversation has solely become about your biases and respectfulness (and according to Choosetoswim, your maturity level! LOL!). 
But either way, he has an amazing point, and that is you are a brilliant fellow with much insights to offer, and yet it&#039;s all lost on the public when you let your emotions and biases shine through your posts, instead of debating things logically and open-mindedly. Why dont you try presenting your opinions without making it so obvious you have a chip on your shoulder, and i can promise you they will be more widely accepted. 
Just a piece of constructive criticism from a friend and relative who cares!

		<description><![CDATA[You have made a mountain of a molehill. This post is mild. It is not blatantly or in your face disrespectful. If you read between the lines you can see it. I don&#039;t agree with you that this post is somehow responsible for &quot;hate&quot;. There is no hate in this post. There is no hate in any of my posts. Your assertions are hyperbole at best, distortions at worst. The issue I took in this post has nothing to do with charedism. It is about making Judaism &quot;one size fits all&quot; as the conversation about Favebook and rabbis tried to do. I call that dumb. I see no reason for you or anyone else to defend it. Gedolim don&#039;t think the world is one size fits all. You are defending the indefensible. And for what? We both agree that making a rule about Facebook for all rabbis is dumb. So why criticize me for saying what you agree with? It makes no sense. And my disrespect? It is not towards real leaders. It is to the small group of rabbis, none of them leaders or gedolim of any sort who held a dumb conference. This is what you are so worried about? Please.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[People respond more to how something is said far more than they respond to what is being said.  Whether or not your point is correct is debatable (though on this one you were mistaken in your premise for the post) but that has nothing to with your tone.  You ask that people only debate your points, but you are not willing to remove your agenda hidden  (poorly at that) within your posts.  Try posting something without any bias and see the reactions.  You seem to be more interested in your agenda than any truth your are seeking in debating.  Ask someone who&#039;s guidance you seek and trust if tone matters.  I am sure, unless they are of your kin (i.e. an agenda against orthodox Jews), you will be told to be respectful.  Knowing you personally though I am not surprised that you treat those your against with such disrespect it is an immaturity you always had and have not outgrown.  It is sad to see.  I am sure you will get calls to ban me for such a comment, but I do not mean this as an attack, I mean it as constructive criticism.  You can gain a lot form being more respectful in your posts, especially of something which you care deeply about.  The tone only furthers the hate, and it is necessary to stem that as much as possible.  As a rabbi with a public blog, and in a community such as yours, duty calls on you to teach love and tolerance even of those with whom you disagree. No matter how strongly you oppose them.  Tisha B&#039;av is almost upon, it behooves us to be as united as possible.  We do not need anymore baseless hatred, and your harsh condescension is only creating more.]]></description>

My point was, and continues to be, you don&#039;t like tone, fine. That&#039;s not an argument against what I have said. If you have an argument against what I have said, I encourage you to make. I enjoy debate as do you. But to fight over respectfulness and tone is not productive.

That being said, I do apologize if my tone is offensive to you. I care passionately about Judaism and I am pained over what I see happening. I also see that sometimes my passion can distract from the message by allowing people to dismiss or focus on tone.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are correct that i dont necessarily ascribe to the direction extreme right Orthodoxy is taking. But i am hugely respectful of it and those who lead it. And i dont feel the need to publicly express my intolerance of their ways. I get the feeling that you feel more obligated to defend African Americans, Hispanics, gays and lesbians, than you do your fellow Jews, for whom you seem to have nothing but spewing vitriolic hatred. 
And yes, you do have a &quot;tone&quot; problem, that needs to be toned down! Condescension is not just in the ears of the beholder- if you meant to be condescending, which you make very clear that you do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@google-5a34304cd25ec220865c964c8f78ac04:disqus : Why are you so aghast? I don&#039;t pledge blind allegiance to the stream of orthodox Judaism to the extreme right. And neither do you. Neither does anyone who reads this blog or for that matter, any blog, as blogs and the Internet are forbidden.
Condescension is in the eye of the beholder. Indeed, I do take issue with the direction of orthodox Judaism. I make no claims to the contrary. Some posts on this blog are a way for me to express equally valid orthodox Jewish positions that are marginalized due to the shift to the right in orthodox Judaism. You, who I happen to know personally, are 10 times more likely to appreciate the version of orthodoxy expressed in this blog than the extremism you seem to be defending. I know, you probably agree with me, you just don&#039;t like the tone. But again, tone is in the ear of the beholder. The issue I take is with an extreme position that has crept into the mainstream. 

Finally, this point was made earlier and I will make it again for your benefit: Tolerance does not mean tolerating intolerance. Tolerance does not mean I need to also include racists, Nazis, terrorists and pedophiles. It means that I accept that any person has the right and should think, practice and promote the lifestyle of their choosing. However if that lifestyle is intolerant of others and is so narrow so as to exclude perfectly good and innocent people, I do not, nee, should not tolerate that. And neither should you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I did not say you cannot allow your emotions to be involved I said you should not.  By speaking through your emotions you overshadow any validity to your post.  All you show is your immaturity when discussing something you disagree with.  Try removing your emotions and discussing your issues from a strictly intellectual perspective.  You will gain a lot more form it.

Additionally, as a rabbi you have to be able to remove yourself when discussing anything.  Once you become partial you nullify everything, no matter how slight it is.  

As to your point about intolerance.  Why have you decided that they are intolerant?  You are stereotyping.  Do you not consider yourself a right wing orthodox Jew?  Would you say you are intolerant as well because you are one of them?  It is the same as any other community, a few radicals give the whole a bad name.  Chris Rock, the comedian has a routine on this. You should see/ listen to it.  It is quite enlightening.  I will not post it since it may be offensive to some people, but if you email me I will be glad to send it to you. Oh and by the way tolerance means accepting that other people can have a differing view than you, whether or not you view it as intolerant and close minded.]]></description>

There is no reason I should not allow my emotions to be involved. Life is full of emotions. Blogs are no different.

As to your last point. Tolerance and tolerant people are absolutely permitted to be intolerant of intolerance. I accept that right wing orthodoxy is a valid stream of Judaism.

		<description><![CDATA[Speaking of reading the article I think  you need to read it again, a bit more carefully.

Firstly, nowhere does it say that Facebook is a not allowed for any rabbi.

Secondly, your comment about the wife using in the rabbi&#039;s place is completely misleading.  The rabbi who says the wife should monitor the account said it as a practical solution.  The rabbi need not see ever status change and other posting that the congregants post because it is nonsense.  It is useless for him to see it and as a result the rabbi offered the solution that the wife monitor it and tell the rabbi what is going on, presumably as a filter form the nonsense.  Not a bad idea considering the rabbi is usually busy doing other, more important things, and need not waste time on Facebook.  

Thirdly, the overall tone of the article is that Facebook is acceptable, but needs some supervision or guidance about its use.

Aside from your misunderstanding of the article, I take issue with your condescending attitude toward orthodox Judaism.  Every time there is any sort of guidance given on any topic you attack screaming about &quot;conformity Judaism&quot;.  You are so narrow, and closed minded that you view everything in a &quot;this is the only way&quot; light.  Your view is the  &quot;only way&quot;, that is why you can say &quot;it is so stupid it makes my brain hurt&quot;.  Whether you agree or not your emotions should not be involved.   Your response above does not address the disrespect you show toward right wing orthodoxy.  Open your mind and start practicing your liberal preaching of acceptance, accept everyone even those who you disagree with.]]></description>

1) No gedolim spoke to this issue. Why you start talking about gedolim is beyond me.

2) The &quot;stupid&quot; part was a bunch of run of the mill rabbis trying to establish ANY standard for ALL rabbis. The one who said ALL RABBIS SHOULD be on Facebook is just as dumb as the ALL RABBIS SHOULD NOT be on Facebook opinion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I appreciate your comments. But your comments are off the mark.

Movies and television are also not prohibited. There are plenty of movies and Jewish television programming that are kosher and endorsed by gedolim. The medium is not prohibited. The content may be prohibited. But that&#039;s because the content is not controlled by the viewer. Facebook is entirely controlled by the user.

You also don&#039;t understand my remarks about it being so stupid it hurts my brain. That some would not want to be on the Internet or Facebook is entirely understandable. But to think that all rabbis are similar enough with similar enough situations and circumstances to think that one ruling for everyone makes an ounce of sense is incredibly stupid. As I wrote there are many kinds of rabbis, communities, needs and expectations. No one rule could apply to all of them. Ever. Thinking a rule could apply to all of them is stupid. Yes.

Your comments about my not be willing to accept others opinions is also off the mark. Certainly for some rabbis, Facebook is inappropriate. But THAT IS NOT WHAT SOME RABBIS AT THE CONFERENCE SAID. They said it is prohibited for all rabbis. Always. And stay calm. No gedolim were quoted in this article. It was a group of orthodox rabbis. Not gedolim. Did you read the linked article?!

The fact that you read this blog post the way you did shows me you did not read the post carefully nor did you read the linked article. Next time, look before you leap. Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Isn&#039;t television also a medium? Movies in a theater?
Theoretically you can broadcast Torah shiurim on television and make a massive Kiddush Hashem and be mikarev the whole world!!! So how come almost every Rosh Yeshiva and Rav in Lakewood NJ signed the petition forbidding televisions in homes? (i am not saying I agree or disagree with this policy. I personally dont follow such a ruling, but have the respect to not call rules i dont understand which are made by Gedolim &quot;so incredibly stupid, it hurts my brain&quot;).

Also, how could they forbid a medium? You claim a medium is not positive or negative, it just IS!

Rabbi Fink, you have to understand that there are going to be things in life you dont understand and dont agree with. You cannot continue to make a mass public protest about the unbelievable stupidities of Jewish leaders and Gedolim every time they say something just because you dont understand or agree! Or at least tone it down- sometimes your emotional expressions are downright disrespectful and lack the maturity and willingness to respect other people&#039;s opinions (e.g. &quot;so incredibly stupid, it hurts my brain&quot;! Come on, what is that?). 

Gedolim can and will forbid mediums. You and I might not understand or agree, but with their heightened spiritual sensitivity, they have the right to lead us and inform us that certain mediums, even though they do have POTENTIALLY redeeming qualities, are too dangerous to the spiritual development of a Jew. And did you ever think that they might (justifiably so), also hold Rabbis to a higher standard, and pasken that such a spiritually dangerous medium, though it may have some great positive uses,  are not appropriate for a Rabbi to publicly utilize? Any Rabbi! Maybe its because Rabbis using it gives it a subconcious stamp of approval to others who will not use it in the proper way. I dont know. I&#039;m just saying neither do you. Thus I beg you to please be a little bit more open minded in your sharp, seemingly closed-minded critique. ]]></description>
