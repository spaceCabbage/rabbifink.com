		<description><![CDATA[Personally, I think #2 is the most fitting.

I agree with Azi regarding #3. There is a probem with textual variants, then we ignore the issue by just skipping right over it to halacha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is what we have today what God gave to Israel in the desert? No way. 
Does that bother me? No way.

Does the existence of this very essay lend itself to acknowledging that there may be a problem? Yes. 
What&#039;s the problem? The strain of thought that it has to be the same letter for letter. 
Does option (3) answer this problem? No. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Meaning, it is a non-issue. Congratulations. (By the way, these days, this is my personal approach.)&quot;

This isn&#039;t an approach, it&#039;s ignoring the problem. Perhaps what you meant is that 1 + 2 = 3

		<description><![CDATA[1) [This is not my personal position but this is my understanding of it.] Let&#039;s assume that God would not orchestrate the development of the Torah in way that would circumvent the very rules stated within the Torah, IE these laws are forever.

2) Not mysterious. But it is quite different than the modern view of the Rambam&#039;s 8th.

3) Meaning, it is a non-issue. Congratulations. (By the way, these days, this is my personal approach.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An officer of the Torah-True Police Force will be over shortly. Be prepared to hand in your yarmulka and to have your circumcision revered. 

---
Regarding your three suggestions: (1) I don&#039;t know what that means, why stop at textual discrepancies, perhaps Mordechai Kaplan&#039;s inventions were apart of the Grand Plan as well. (2) You make it sound like there&#039;s something mysterious about this, when it really should be expected. (3) This answer doesn&#039;t even attempt to address the problem, it&#039;s just skirting around the issue. ]]></description>
