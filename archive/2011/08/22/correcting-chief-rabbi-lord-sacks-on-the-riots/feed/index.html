		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Further, there are many wonderful societies not based on Jude0-Christian values where, I know this is going to sound shocking, there are not violent riots.
Indeed, like in Japan after the earthquake. But they still respect those value system and use it. It still is honored. In Britain, they are dispensing with where their values are coming from and thus creating a void. And like you said, they are bored and selfish. So yes, they will riot with the excuses that it&#039;s the economy. But it&#039;s not the economy making them riot....it&#039;s their lack of values.Â 

&#062;Honesty and peace are universal good values. There is no reason to make this a religious issue.

Sure their good values...but where are they going to come from? Some sort of system is required to teach it to them ESPECIALLY when their own interests are on the line. I think making this into a religious issue is perfect. Of course this does not mean that all religious people are good and secular people are bad. Of course not. But simply looking at Britain (or all western europe perhaps), Â one can ask if them becoming more secular has been more positive or more negative.Â 

&#062;Perhaps most bothersome to me about the article is that similar hooligans in the USA who are gang members certainly express themselves as religious.

I can call myself a billionaire....it doesn&#039;t make a billionaire.Â ]]></description>
