		<description><![CDATA[So you don&#039;t think people should see more that one side of an issue?

Do you know how many people have been burned by kiruv types hiding flaws? Misrepresenting Judaism as a monolith (which it&#039;s not)? Being lied to and then finding out they were lied to? 
Truth, honesty and breadth of Jewishness and tolerance for different approaches to Judaism is my preferred way of reaching out to Jews, orthodox and otherwise. 
I understand you feel differently but it is about time you &quot;get&quot; that this is a valid approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Or I do understand you and since I am opposed to a lot of it I must not understand you. 

 I have noticed that the people who constantly disagree with you are not around to comment for very long.  This can be for a couple of reasons. 1) You ban them because they don&#039;t understand you, your approach . . . And you have a hard time with that so they eventually get banned for whatever justification you find. 2) They get tired of trying to rationally discuss and debate something with someone who will never agree with his detractors, solely because they are his detractors. (you can&#039;t agree to me, but when the same thing was said by someone else you eventually agreed with him)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am saying, exposing people to vitriolic hatred of a sect of Judaism will not help bring them closer to Judaism.  I did not say they do not think critically, they do, but now they have a new or reinforced view to think about.  

Is this your justification for anything negative resulting from your posts?  It isn&#039;t your fault because the readers thought critically about it and reached a decision, completely uninfluenced by your words.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What positive, other than exposing impressionable minds to anti-chareidi propaganda, is there in this post.  While it is OK to question how they reach their decisions, there is no gain in publicizing them.  What you consistently fail to see is that people take issue not with your stance, but with the fact that a rabbi of a shul, dedicated to teaching jews about their heritage (your secular translation of kiruv) constantly preaches anti religious propaganda.  Realize that you are more interested in bringing people into the anti chareidi camp than the fold of orthodox jewry (your primary reason for having moved out to CA in the first place).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;First and foremost, any unanimous decision regarding a capital case was discarded. 
I never quite understood this, other than the fact that they really did not want to execute someone. I mean, what is the difference if it&#039;s a capital case or civil infraction? Either the the evidence is there, or it&#039;s not. Why should the fact that it&#039;s a capital case shape how the evidence has influenced the judges?]]></description>
