		<description><![CDATA[In these critical times, when nations are challenging one another and violence is increasing in an unbelievable manner, the Jews have the power to bring about peace in the entire world.
In order that the entire world should be orderly, it is essential that each and every one of the &quot;seventy nations&quot; should be influenced so that they will work on settling the world through spreading the Seven Mitzvos  &amp; influencing the nations to keep their mitzvos,  in order to assist our task of making the world into a dwelling place for G-d, and help bring about the arrival of Moshiach. Every individual must do everything possible to hasten his coming. In order to bring awareness of these Seven Mitzvos to the world I have recently created a blog for this sole purpose
