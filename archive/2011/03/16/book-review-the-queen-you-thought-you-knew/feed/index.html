		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,
The fact of the matter is that Rabbi Fohrman is looking at the text at face value. You cant bring into a Torah text theories about green Vashtis with a tail or a Malach pushed Haman on the couch. most of the Chazal opinion on the matters of Purim are just as speculative and at times wishfull thinking.  Read Jacob Hoschanders &quot;The Book of Esther in the Light of History&quot; to appreciate the fact for example that there was a province of Persia called AGAG and that is where Haman probably hailed from and all attempts to link him to King Agag of Shauls time is just midrashic wishfull thinking.
  Rabbi Forhman has taken the &quot;what do we see if we approach the Megilla at face value&quot; approach and he succeeds in being very convincing in a story that Chazals often fantastical interpetations would have you think the Megillah nothing more then a fairy tale.
Be Well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From what I&#039;ve read, the book may make use of academic scholarship and methods, but it is not academic in any meaningful sense (not that there&#039;s anything wrong with that). Unfortunately, in the yeshiva world, &quot;academic&quot; is often a synonym for &quot;peshat.&quot;
Regarding hte novelty, I think you&#039;ll find that a similar approach to the Megilla, particularly the discovery of counter-readings and intertextual allusions, was taken by Rabbi Dr. Yonatan Grossman: http://vbm-torah.org/ester.html
Of course, R. Grossman is largely unknown in America.
