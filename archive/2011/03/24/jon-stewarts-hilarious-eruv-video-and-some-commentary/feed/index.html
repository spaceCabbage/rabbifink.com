		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, it seemed like you were confusing the two in your first paragraph. And it&#039;s useful for anybody reading this to know the difference. And it&#039;s useful for us to not confuse the terms in our discussion.

I won&#039;t push it, but I am saying that an eruv is a legal fiction. Tzurat hapetach isn&#039;t a legal fiction, per se, but it&#039;s utilization to enclose a whole city without any real walls is a legal fiction. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know the difference. I see now what you are saying. You aren&#039;t saying (as I thought) that an eruv is a legal fiction. Rather the utilization of tzuros hapesach as walls is the legal fiction. Sorry for misunderstanding. So to amend my point, it matters not what was intended by the rabbis when they considered a tzuras hapesach a wall. What matters is that it is considered a wall and that wall can technically enclose an entire city making it one big chatzer (like a walled city).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A loophole allows a law to be circumvented, in a way that wasn&#039;t anticipated when the law was written. So if the law of not carrying was written before the eruv concept was created, and if the law about tying a string over a gate wider than 10 ammot was not intended to allow an evruv, then I&#039;d say an eruv is taking advantage of a loophole in the original law. So the intent is the issue. The fact that it works doesn&#039;t stop it from being a loophole - loopholes work; that&#039;s why they exist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eruv chatzerot and tzurat hapetach (&quot;eruv&quot;) are not the same thing. 

Eruv chatzerot is for people in a yard to be able to carry. The way they do it is with the legal fiction of all eating together. All residents contribute to the meal (we usually use matzo, because it lasts a long time and doesn&#039;t go treyfe on pesach). Then they are allowed to carry from house to house. This is in addition to the requirement of the yard being enclosed.

Tzurat hapetach is if you have an enclosed area, but there is an opening of more than ten amot. Then can put two poles upright and one pole across on top of them to close the opening. This was then utilized on a broader scale for cities and non-enclosed villages. The original tzurat hapetach was only intended to close an opening in a wall. Nobody intended for the whole wall to consist of openings. No wall consists of all gates. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure, the Rabbis didn&#039;t intend for a modern day eruv the size of a city but they did intend for the home within a chatzer to be joined. Is their intent the issue here? Or is the issue whether it works? And whether it is technically a loophole?

And I am 100% maskim that there are those who shun eruvin in general. That is their prerogative, but aren&#039;t we discussing those who do use eruvin?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It seems unlikely that when the rabbis proposed that tying a string over a gate wider than 10 amot, they intended for the modern-day eruv to exist. Indeed, no lesser authority than the Rambam rules that our use of this concept doesn&#039;t work because the open space is greater than the filled-in space in the &quot;wall,&quot; rendering it not a wall (פרוץ מרובה על העומד).

No rule is created. Rather, preexisting rules are used in ways that nobody intended them to be used. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In responding to Susan, I used her own words, &quot;redefined&quot; to disagree.

Your point is taken, but I use the term legal fiction in the way it is used in American Law, that is, a rule CREATED to avoid a legal issue. Here, no rule has been created. All that is being done, is using the existing rules to enable a prohibited activity. I think that makes sense. You?

And thank you for the nitpicking clarification. It is useful to the conversation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[E. Fink, you don&#039;t seem to understand what a legal fiction is. Nobody is disputing the definition of a private domain with regards to halacha (except for many Rishonim and modern Jews who don&#039;t hold by tzurot hapetach). Rabbis (not uncontraversially) used the concept of a tzurat hapetach to enable Jews to carry once they were no longer living in enclosed cities. You are, however, right that it wasn&#039;t redefined. That would be a poor legal fiction, which must rely on preexisting concepts in a new, creative way.

Also note that if you rent private space in your home, it is not clear that you don&#039;t need an ERUV, in the technical and not vernacular sense, in order to carry from one to the next. Apartment buildings that are all inhabited by Jews do need an eruv, according to SA Orach Chaim 370. But that&#039;s just me being nitpicky with your words. Sorry for that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If halacha defined a private space in that manner in order to allow the eruv concept to work, it&#039;s still a loophole being exploited by redefining the meaning of  a private domain.

The point is, people aren&#039;t supposed to carry stuff outside their home (or homestead) on Shabbat, and an eruv exists in order to create a technicality to allow people to carry stuff other places.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again, this is incorrect. You are mixing your understanding of english terms and applying them to halacha.

In halacha a private domain is defined as a an area that is united by a wall and a common area / item. This is required for an eruv to work for a commnity as I mentioned in the post.

The factors you mention, such as permission to enter are not relevant to the issue of whether it is a halachic wall and whether it joins the domains into one. (To illustrate: If you rent private space in my home, we do not need an eruv to carry from one to the next).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this notion that an eruv is a halachic wall consisting of a series of halachic gates.

If I understand correctly, all this derives from the interdiction to leave our &quot;dwelling&quot; on shabbat.  In the recent Coen Brothers&#039; film &quot;True Grit,&quot;  Jeff Bridges lays a rope around himself when he lies down to go to sleep in the wilderness.  No one says why, although the impression is that it is to keep snakes from crawling on him when he sleeps - something that becomes a significant issue at the end of the film.  In effect, by doing so he is creating a dwelling.  It shows how a rope can be a wall (or a gate).  And when Matt Damon says, &quot;Hey, what about me?&quot; it raises the issue of  community.  They have eaten together, but not joined their walls.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is a loophole. To put up a wire and claim it&#039;s all one private area is a legal fiction. I am free to go anywhere in my own private home. I am free to go anywhere in the public domain. But I am not free to go anywhere in a private space that belongs to someone other than me.

When you put up an eruv around a neighborhod including my house, you are claiming you have just made the neighborhood into one big private space. But it is not one big private space, according to US law or the sensibilities of many of the people living there. Even with the eruv including my house, other people who live within the eruv do not have the right to enter my house without my permission, nor do I have the right to enter their house within the same eruc without their permission.

Thus, saying it&#039;s one big private space is a fiction.

By the way, I support both the eruv in New York and the proposed one in LA, because it doesn&#039;t hurt anyone else. I&#039;m just agreeing with the Daily Show that it is, indeed, a loophole.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not a symbolic wall, nor is it a halachic wall. It&#039;s a halachic series of gates. The technical term is tzurat hapetach. 

It&#039;s also very clearly a legal fiction, which doesn&#039;t make it illegitimate. But calling it a &quot;loophole&quot; isn&#039;t really so off, and that&#039;s coming from someone who is completely shomer shabbos, (obviously) including hotza&#039;a. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Quote: All in all, I would say that Stewart&#039;s mocking of the eruv as a loophole meaningfully captures public perceptions of various aspects of rabbinic Judaism.

Having seen eruv fights in neighboring towns, I couldn&#039;t understand why those leading the fight against didn&#039;t see the eruvim that way. Maybe they&#039;ll see the clip and understand now. To the non-observant, a loophole. To those who observe, something to enhance our Shabbosim.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the Daily Show staff actually grasped the halachic legal logic of an eruv and still chose to ridicule it. That is what they do. They specialize in exposing the disjuncture between a system&#039;s internal logic and the commonsense of the rest of us. You laid out the halachic rationale, which depends on legal constructs which are not intuitively obvious. Of course, for an orthodox Jew, the legal construct is real, because the consequences are real. If the eruv breaks, your Sabbath can be seriously altered. But for others the concept contradicts their understanding of the ordinary definition of public and private areas. Why should a non-orthodox Jew find the eruv a meaningful way of saying their main thoroughfare is now part of cojoined private property. For all purposes of secular law, it is public property. The very effort to make the eruv less intrusive to the secular public undermines the claim that it is real. To the unbigoted secular  public an eruv is a silly thing that Jews do. Hoping for appreciation of its logic and rationality is hoping for too much. Legal constructs are perceived as real when their consequences are manifest in practical terms. Eruv is a very hard sell.

		<description><![CDATA[If the wall is symbolic, why do we need the physical wall, i.e. the string itself?  Why wouldn&#039;t the act of joining the communities - the sharing of the bread in some cases, for instance - not be sufficient to create the symbolic wall?]]></description>
