		<description><![CDATA[There is a reason there is more than one channel to watch. See something you don&#039;t want to see, turn the channel. Same with the internet. There is a reason there is an X at the top of ever page in your browser. Censorship has become an increasingly difficult concept to swallow. Just because someone doesn&#039;t want to see something doesn&#039;t mean the person next to them doesn&#039;t want to see it. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not a &quot;fan&quot; of censorship either. But there are different ads shown during children;s cartoons than CSI. The Super Bowl is more like those children&#039;s cartoons than CSI. All I am saying is it should not be treated like an adults only program.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not a fan of censorship and I don&#039;t view the Superbowl as a kids activity. That is not to say that some won&#039;t watch. I started watching more than 30 years ago so clearly I was a child. But while I am not a fan of introducing anything/everything to our kids I don&#039;t think that we can hide the world either.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that it is not hypocritical because they are censoring the message not the medium.

Personally I could do without the barely dressed women and innuendo, but that is not being censored at all. I am happy that AT LEAST they are censoring MESSAGES that are inappropriate for children. Affairs and Jesus both.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But my point isn&#039;t what you and I find innocuous, it&#039;s what the people doing the censorship find objectionable based on their world-view. And whether there is any hypocrisy evident in their choices of what to censor and what not to censor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Go Daddy is different because the product is completely innocuous.

Ain&#039;t nothing wrong with a little beer.

And yes, the FF button was invented for people like you and I. Good job.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What about the sexy GoDaddy ads? They seem to allow those every year.

And how about those beer ads for the kiddies to see?

My kids know nothing about ads having grown up on TiVo. A few months ago, they were at my in-laws apartment and were watching TV, the minute a commercial came on, they all asked &quot;where is the fast forward button?&quot; :-)]]></description>
