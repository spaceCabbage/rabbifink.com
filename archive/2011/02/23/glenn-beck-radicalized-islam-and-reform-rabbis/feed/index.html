		<description><![CDATA[You wrote:&quot;Because if not for Reform Judaism, almost all secular Jews would completely lose their connection to Judaism.&quot;

I&#039;m not certain that&#039;s universally valid. I know many heloni (non-observant Jews) in Israel who light Shabat candles, recite the blessing on the hallah, and celebrate the ragalim. They may drive on Shabat, light fires (many still smoke), watch tv (in the &quot;old days&quot; tv from Lebanon, Jordan, &#038; Cyprus), and they may roundly criticize the political and mercenary rabbinute, but they DO have a strong connection to both Judaism and to Israel - albeit perhaps more to Israel than Judaism. North Africans tend to look at Jews as less observant than me/more observant than me/like me; O/C/R and other designations are useless in context of observance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink:

Seriously get a grip. Stop trying to avoid the issues by talking about &quot;witch hunting,&quot; &quot;paranoia,&quot; and &quot;McCarthyism.&quot; 

You really are not fooling anyone.

Instead of admitting you made multiple serious errors, you try to tear down the person who merely stated arguments backed up by scriptual texts.

As of yet, you have been unable to produce one text or makor in the Rishonim or Achronim that supports your radical statements.

You obviously realized that you were unable to defend or support your views, so you had to tweet for somone else to offer a weak response in your place.

The fact that you can&#039;t answer on your own is very revealing.

But perhaps you wish to redeeem yourself? Cite a Rishon who Achron who supports your view (an disagrees with the sources that have already been cited, that consider you views to be prohibited according to the Torah), or offer a retraction.

Or of course, you could continue with your snide childish insults.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just for the record, (because it appears that Rabbi Fink prefers to insult commentors on his site, rather than honestly responding to factual questions, with factual answers) the following is from Rabbi Fink&#039;s Twitter postings today (which could be found when you click his profile link that appear on every comment he posts):

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier Rabbi Fink wrote:

&quot;Enough with the name calling. If you want to debate, fine. No more insults please.&quot; 

Now Rabbi Fink writes:

&quot;...you would be a great witch hunter..you come off as condescending, presumptuous, arrogant, bombastic and above all annoying...&quot;

Your tactic of repeatedly insulting an individual instead of responding to the clear facts and sources that are presented is self-defining.  

Thus far, there have been 166 comments on this site. You, the Rabbi, and write of the initial post, was unable to cite even 1 source in response to the multiple citations presented by a group of intellectually honest individuals. 

Why would you recklessly attack and villify individuals who&#039;s only interest is to have an open, intelligent, and honest debate?]]></description>

Answer it honestly and maybe I will answer your question.

As an aside, you would be a great witch hunter. All you do is imagine incediary ideas, fabricate ideas based on those imaginary ideas, make accusations, divert attention to whatever smidgen of inconsistency you think you have found. Honestly, you come off as condescending, presumptuous, arrogant, bombastic and above all annoying. I&#039;m just about done with you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;You still haven&#039;t addressed why you think the Reform Rabbis are apikorsim (and not in class of &quot;tinok shenishba&quot;, for example).&quot;

Reform Rabbis publicly deny fundamental principles of Judaism (as explained above), which are prerequisites for one to be called a Torah Jew, as opposed to a Kofer/apikoris.

&quot;But I will admit that I am not so learned and much of this is over my head. For example, I&#039;ve never seen anything (or at least don&#039;t recall seeing anything) by Rabbeinu Yona until you mentioned him above.&quot;

I am humbled by your honesty. I hope that you will retain your wonderful trait of seeking Torah knowledge and not allow it to be impacted by the shocking not-accepted views expressed by the author of this website.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is not meant as an analogy in any way whatsoever, it&#039;s just to paint how crazy your question above is:
If a guy was in jail for murdering an innocent child, publicly worshipping a can of dung, and being m&#039;anes a married woman, and he discovered a cure for cancer- would you praise him?

He has a din of a Rasha, and he commited transgressions that he is obligated to die, before preforming them. 

As you recognize that one must be ready to be killed before publicly denying Torah M&#039;Sinai. As the Reform Rabbis publicly do.

I think the main problem is that you are not really bothered by kefirah. You don&#039;t really recognize that one who is a kofer has a din of &quot;ein lo chelek l&#039;olam habah.&quot;

Otherwise you wouldn&#039;t be able to laud and praise them (and speak of their &quot;importance for the future of Judaism&quot;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Additional context for source material against your position. I&#039;m still waiting to hear a Rishon (or Achron) who says that you are allowed to praise kofrim. I am still amazed by the fact that you are unashamed to say that you publicly argue with one of the Gedolei Rishonim (the Rabeinu Yona), based on what you consider a hashmatus HaRambam.:

&quot;191. One may come to praise the wicked through simplemindedness. For the simpleton says that it is good to praise, whether the praise be deserved or not. And, unknowingly, he praises the dead; for our Sages have said that the wicked are considered dead in their lifetime (Berachot 18b). They are accounted shades in their lifetime, and are called &quot;dead,&quot; as it is said, &quot;But the dead know not anything&quot; (Ecclesiastes 9: 5). And this unintentional sin is accounted intentional; for the master will not love that servant who loves his foes and befriends those who are distant from him. Reason should render this evident. And it is said, &quot;But as for the fools, they carry away shame&quot; (Proverbs 3: 35). This has been previously explained.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(Not disabled. There is a limit to replies because otherwise the thread gets too physically narrow for comments.)

And I am not flip flopping. I have maintained the same opinion for over a week now. It&#039;s not my fault that somehow the cognitive abilities of the commenters seems to be severely limited.

My position is and always has been:

Denial of TMS is apikorsus.
RJ is by definition apikorsus.
Most RJ are not apikorsim.
There&#039;s nothing wrong with praising apikorsim for laudable acts or positions.
I am now aware of a RY to the contrary, I don&#039;t believe this is a mainstream opinion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am replying to your most recent comment here because you seem to have disabled the reply option to your post. I apologize but I am now quite confused as to the coherence of your last few statements so please clarify how all of the following are consistent with one another. If you feel I am taking things out context please explain how as an alternative to just saying so:

First, you acknowledged that your previous statements are untenable according to Rabeinu Yona--a Rishon--stating that we pasken like the Rambam (we won&#039;t get into whether the Rambam would also hold it is assur to praise kofrim at this moment).

Then, after apparently realizing that it is not such a good thing to be at odds with a Rishon while being unable to find a Rishon in support of your position, you retreated to a position where you stated that you are not &quot;convinced&quot; that reform rabbis are kofrim. I understood that to mean that in the even you WERE convinced that reform rabbis were kofrim then you would agree that your position is assur, hence my original post.

You responded by that by saying taking a position directly on point addressed by Rabeinu Yonah as being assur.

It seems you have now retreated to your middleground where you seem to acknowledge that disavowing torah m&#039;sinai IS kefirah AND believing such a thing is a hallmark of kfirah YET you are stating that a reform rabbi who holds such beliefs may not be learned enough to understand that he in fact holds heretical beliefs.

If this is correct, then aside from being a huge flip-flop, it is also not only contrary to Rabeinu Yona, you are implicitly arguing on Reb Chaim&#039;s famous understanding of Rambam in Hilchos Daos (&quot;Nebech an apikoris iz oichet an apikoris&quot;)

		<description><![CDATA[Why the deflection? The RABEINU YONA is not just &quot;[dis]approv[ing] of them&quot; he is addressing PRECISELY what you speak of--namely, praising kofrim. Should I now take you latest statement ie. &quot;I agree that RY may not approve of them. But I maintain it is permissible to seek the good in anyone. Even kofrim.&quot; as your agreement that reform rabbis are indeed kofrim? (hint: they disavow torah m&#039;sinai)

		<description><![CDATA[So you are doing another 180, regarding something you stated just four hours ago?

I wrote:

&quot;Well, in conclusion (for accuracy sake, everyone is directed to read the full context of the discussion above):

1) The Torah, the Written and Oral Law has never changed since the Jews received it on Sinai, and never will change in the future.

2) Torah Jews (aka: Orthodox Jews) are commanded to believe the above principle, and those who don&#039;t are considered kofrim.

3) Reform Jews don not believe the above principle.&quot;

And Rabbi Fink responded:

&quot;1) It has. Sorry.

2) We are commanded to TREAT the Written and Oral Torah as unchanged.

3) This is correct.

4) No.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) Rabbi Fink (who understands and states that Reform Rabbis are Kofrim) states:

&quot;Reform Rabbis are learned, spiritual leaders and teachers who are important for the future of Judaism&quot;

&quot;Reform Judaism challenged Rav Hirsch and the Chasam Sofer to sharpen their hashkafos and approach to Judaism..It’s a mild form of kinas sofrim.&quot;



2) After Rabbi Fink is shown the Sha&#039;arei Tshuva 3:189 who writes that even praising for his positive traits and deeds while ignoring his evil traits and deeds is not permitted, and that the Rabbeinu Yaona finds support for this in the verse in Mishlei (28:4) which states that those who desert the Torah are the ones who praise a Rasha, Rabbi Fink states the following:

&quot;There is nothing wrong with praising specific things about an apikores.&quot;

And:

&quot;Do you follow the entire Sefer HaYirah? Same Rabbeinu Yonah. I&#039;m guessing not.&quot;]]></description>
