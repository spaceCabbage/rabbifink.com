		<description><![CDATA[&gt;They provide contraception to millions of women who would have no other way of getting it. That&#039;s a good thing. And something the SCOTUS has held is a fundamental right.

I understand its their right, but why isn&#039;t it their right to seek it out privately and not federally funded. How does one go from a woman not being able to afford (or get) contraception = tax payers needing to subsidize it? How do these things even get declared to be a fundamental right? Which...I would say getting your OWN IS, but being entitled to free one isn&#039;t.

Regarding Nascar, I guess in a country with a volunteer army, its this sort of marketing that needs to exist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The argument for NASCAR is that they get a lot of recruits from there. (Did you hear about the Congresswoman from MN who got a horrible, racist, disgusting fax because she wanted to cut NASCAR&#039;s funding? http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/02/after-taking-on-nascar-dem-rep-is-threatened-document.php?ref=fpb ) Me personally? I agree with you completely. This is all ridiculous and makes me angry and frustrated.

And, just to put this into perspective, you know the funding PP receives per year? Per YEAR? That will buy a bit under 4 hours of war. :) Yeah. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Serandez: There a few things in play here.

1) the military does not NEED to recruit, their numbers are higher than ever. (something to do with the economy, I am sure).

2) The post was really about what happened on ONE DAY in Congress. They talked extensively about lowering the budget to justify hacking PP and then turned around and approved a NASCAR sponsorship. It is obviously double-speak. 

3) There is a reason PP should be Federally funded. It provides a huge service to the tax payers by provided confidential, legal care for prevention of unwanted pregnancy and legal termination of pregnancy. This is precisely the kind of programs the Federal government DOES fund. They are not deceptive. They provide contraception to millions of women who would have no other way of getting it. That&#039;s a good thing. And something the SCOTUS has held is a fundamental right.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really, given the vast military budget, the money spent on Super Bowl ads &amp; NASCAR sponsorship is chump change. Then again, compared to the vast military budget, the amount of federal funding for Planned Parenthood was also chump change: $75 million/year, which is less than what it costs to fund 4 hours of war in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan. 

Economics aside, I agree with Rabbi Eliyahu that the symbolic politics here stinks. No doubt the Super Bowl &amp; NASCAR audiences are a good demographic for the Marines. But do the Marines really need these vehicles to reach their target, given all the other recruiting resources already at their disposal? No doubt my opposition to the ongoing wars colors my perspective here.  But these expenditures seem like a needless extravagence at a time of calls for austerity.

As for Planned Parenthood, I would add that this organization does much more than perform abortions -- which are, as Rabbi Eliyahu notes, a legal medical procedure. They provide a full array of reproductive health services, for women &amp; men. It is simply untrue that they push abortion over other alternatives. &quot;Live Action,&quot; a right-wing propaganda outfit, are simply not a reliable source of information on this or any other subject. 

Again, I will make my own bias clear: In the past, I have been a volunteer at Planned Parenthood. I support the organization &amp; its mission of enabling all women to make safe, informed, &amp; private decisions about their reproduction. I believe the relatively modest financial support theyy received from the federal government was a good investment in public health.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A NASCAR ad is likely a wise place for the military to be advertising, so that makes sense, as does advertising during the Super Bowl. Hitting a huge demographic of eligible males in one impressive swoop is exactly what you&#039;d want out of your advertising. And defense is certainly an area which all parties agree should be paid for by taxpayers. 

Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood was also being criticized for numerous actions uncovered by Live Action, as clearly noted by the rep. who pushed the bill. The name of the organization is also incredibly deceiving, as they strongly push abortion over carrying a child to term. This is certainly not an organization that should be supported by taxpayer money - even if one agrees with the platform, there&#039;s no reason it should be federally funded.]]></description>
