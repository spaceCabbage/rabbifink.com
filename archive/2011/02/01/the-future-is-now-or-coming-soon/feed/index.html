		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink declares the fact that terrorism is caused by arabs not having access to the internet:
&quot;Until recently, Gazans and West Bank Palestinians have heard one voice. A voice that told them in categorical terms that their life would be better under autonomous rule by Hamas or the PLO. Palestinians believed them. It created fanatics, fascists and suicide bombers. But people can only be told a lie so long as there is no evidence to the contrary.
If someone tells you that the world is flat you know he is lying because you have information that shows him to be lying. Information is king. Therefore, I have contended that my generation (Generation Y) is the information generation. My generation does not accept lies or legends at face value. We know there is a way to learn on our own to unmask lies passed off as facts or legends passed off as history. We are the Wikipedia generation. We know that the information is available and we are willing to find it ourselves.&quot;

Good going Rabbi Fink:
&quot;In 2002 alone, some 189 Israelis were massacred in 53 terror attacks. As the fence kept expanding, hostilities declined, until in 2009 they stood at zero. So these are the numbers. &quot;

And today we see when Israel removes fences and barricades, the Arabs resort to their old behaviour:

		<description><![CDATA[Fickle:
kÂ·le/ËˆfikÉ™l/
Adjective: Changing frequently, esp. as regards one&#039;s loyalties, interests, or affection. 

Not sure what the contradiction or change is between &quot;enjoying a chance to read an individual&#039;s impressions,&quot; but that it being &quot;not necessary&quot; if the individual feels the need to make strange conditions in exchange for hearing their thoughts...

Regardless, the word &quot;fickle&quot; seems out of place :)]]></description>

Put a voting poll on you homepage asking the following question:

In theory, which type of outcome would you prefer to see in the &quot;new&quot; Egypt:

a) A country run by a dictatorship regime, where there is no democracy, but it is not a source of bloodshed or terrorism.

b) A country run by a democratic government, where there is democracy, but it is a source of bloodshed and terrorism.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;2) They haven&#039;t blown anybody up in a long time. And young Gazans are not buying into Hamas either anymore. &quot;

I guess you don&#039;t use you Internet access to see that the decrease in attacks (not attempts) have been due to Israel&#039;s change in policy, no longer allowing the Arabs to have complete freedom of entering and leaving cities at will. Before Sharon tore into the PA and re-enforced a level of Israeli military control, the Arabs were using their freedom of movement (along with their access to the Internet) to murder Jews on an almost monthly basis.

The (not so) funny thing is, the terrorists have been known to use the Internet (that you think is their key to understanding the West) to plot 9/11 and many of the other global massacres they carried out.

I have a math formula which I would like to ask if you agree with:

A) Everytime more freedom and rights are given to Muslim extremists, they carry out more murders and massacres. 

+

B) Everytime less freedom and rights are given to Muslim extremists, they carry out less murderes and massacres. 

=

C) Don&#039;t hand Muslim extremists more freedom and rights, and innocent lives will thus be saved.

Unless, you really don&#039;t mind that innocent people are being butchered, as long as it&#039;s being done by individuals who live in a &quot;democracy.&quot; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) Close. The main point is that with increased, unfiltered communication people will demand freedom.

2) They haven&#039;t blown anybody up in a long time. And young Gazans are not buying into Hamas either anymore. See the link in the post to the Gaza Manifesto.

3) No. I think it was a last ditch effort to show their fundamentalist brethren that the West was wrong.

4) Don&#039;t oversimplify it and don&#039;t misstate the facts. I have Jewish friends who have been to Dubai many times.

5) I think there are fundamentalists who believe that, but Muslims who live in the West with tolerance of others feel no differently about the &quot;end of times&quot; than their Jewish and Christian counterparts.]]></description>

<p>5) I think there are fundamentalists who believe that, but Muslims who live in the West with tolerance of others feel no differently about the &#8220;end of times&#8221; than their Jewish and Christian counterparts.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand what you mean by &quot;true democracy,&quot; as opposed to &quot;not true democracy&quot;.

By defintion it&#039;s either an open vote, democratic society. Or it&#039;s not. As far as I am aware, there is no such thing as &quot;partial democracy.&quot; 

Please enlighten me if you know otherwise (and please don&#039;t compare murduring innocent people, to the civil rights movement).

		<description><![CDATA[1) So your thesis is that the reason why every Islamic country in history was bent on destroying the open society and culture of the Western World, was because they didn&#039;t have Internet access to see how Democracy thrives? 

2) Do you think Hamas (who&#039;s members living in Israel have full access to the Internet) blows up innocent Jewish Women and Children because they don&#039;t realize that living peacfully will be more profitable?

3) Do you think that the 9/11 hijackers murdured thousands of innocent people, because they didn&#039;t have Wi-Fi at home? 

4) Do you think that Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and most other Musilm countries do not even allow Jews to enter their countries- because they don&#039;t have Internet access?

5) Do you recognize that the vast majority of the Muslim world embraces the desire to conquer and replace the Western World, with their own non-democratic beliefs? That they don&#039;t view Islamic dominance as oppression?

		<description><![CDATA[1) I would think that an educated person like yourself would be able to see the analogy without drawing ridiculous conclusions. Forgive me.

2) I have read of this Shah you speak of. I am sure you know that the Iranian revolution occurred BEFORE the Internet. That is a big difference and again, is the POINT of this blog post.

3) I am simply saying that revolutions take time to get it right.

You might want to tone down the rhetoric too. It doesn&#039;t really contribute to the conversation.]]></description>

2) Your whole thesis is that the &quot;change&quot; is positive, and for that reason you are optimistic. The problem is that every established national/international evaluation written regarding the current &quot;changes&quot; point in the direction of more chaos and bloodshed than ever before.
Are you really such an &quot;optimist&quot; that you are ready to support the evil killers and neo-hitler leaders &quot;change&quot; the balance of power, just because they are doing it in a democratic fashion?]]></description>

Second of all, I think you missed a few things.

1) I did not compare blood thirsty terrorists to rabbis. I compared protestors in Egypt to orthodox Jews that are approximately 35 and under who will not relinquish their access to the Internet despite bans from rabbis.

2) I think the self imposition of dictatorships is ending. That was my entire point. The generation of Arabs with access to the Internet and who sees Western civilization wants a freedom that is not yet present in the middle east. They want change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Leah, your analysis is spot on -- the biggest problem with most Americans is that they cannot understand that their culture is just that -- their cultural worldview -- and that many other peoples in the world really, really don&#039;t share their ideas and values. I can&#039;t comment on Arab communities in the US because I have been an Israeli citizen for almost 20 years but I am well acquainted with Arab culture and thought here in the middle east. 

When Arabs scream that they want freedom, they really do -- freedom to attack Israel and destroy Jews and practice Islam to the best of their knowledge and not be beholden to the west or to the Israel that they hate. Arabs/Moslems don&#039;t mean define the word freedom in the same way that Americans do and only someone who is either very naive or very foolish will not listen to the meaning behind the words of the common Egyptian. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To clarify:

Their halachic authority was never binding. I do not mean to say that the Rabbis had no authority. They had authority but as far as halachic practice goes, each person was always permitted to decide the law as they understood it.

And as far as communities like New Square and Lakewood, it is completely voluntary to live there and to care what others say about you.

In any case, that is entirely my point! The system of rabbinic control can only succeed if they also control information and reactions. That is ending. Slowly, but ending.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;The authority of rabbis was never binding except in a rabbinic court or perhaps via an uncontested responsa. It is a folly of this generationâ€™s leadership (or its handlers) that asserted this unilateral power. It never existed and yes, with information this imagined power will disappear.

That is completely, thoroughly untrue. In premodernity the rabbis had legal authority to administer the Jews; not only that, all Jews had to comply unless they converted to Christianity or Islam, or moved to a place without rabbis, which meant without other Jews.

If you mean that recently, in the past 200 or 100 years the authority was voluntary, this is true, but only until a point. Let&#039;s say you live in New Square today. You play by the rules or you leave, but that could mean losing your entire family and all your friends. Not such a free choice, is it? And to a lesser extent this applies even to freer frum societies like Lakewood. Conform or lose your moorings. So although rabbinic authority has no force of law, and although people do push borders and flout it, it *does* exist - and it sure as heck did exist.]]></description>

<p>If you mean that recently, in the past 200 or 100 years the authority was voluntary, this is true, but only until a point. Let&#8217;s say you live in New Square today. You play by the rules or you leave, but that could mean losing your entire family and all your friends. Not such a free choice, is it? And to a lesser extent this applies even to freer frum societies like Lakewood. Conform or lose your moorings. So although rabbinic authority has no force of law, and although people do push borders and flout it, it *does* exist &#8211; and it sure as heck did exist.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[How do you define &quot;glaring&quot;? If you use any measure that includes &quot;the people&quot;, then it is nowhere near the most glaring. Measures like numbers killed, general standard of living, oppression, internecine conflict, government corruption, inability to get ahead despite better education, ferocity of warfare, etc.

But I agree that information and freedom are the keys to the solution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Leah - &lt;i&gt;Their values are very different from yours and &lt;b&gt;the lifestyle of Arab communities in the US is case in point.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;m not sure what you are saying about Arab-Americans. Their community is much like the Jewish-American community of the early/mid 20&#039;th century. Relatively new immigrants, working very hard, starting small businesses, living in enclaves, and ensuring that their children get professional educations (so they don&#039;t have to work as hard as their parents). I daresay that their grandchildren, after wide exposure to the world at large, will also go OTD (&quot;off the derech&quot;) at some rate just as Jewish-Americans are experiencing today.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, but I disagree. The Tunisia revolt brought in an even more radical Islamist government. The Lebanese overthrew a fairly liberal government in favor of Hezbollah. 

Your premises is based on an erroneous idea that people in Arab countries believe in the same values as you do and crave Western culture. They don&#039;t. Their values are very different from yours and the lifestyle of Arab communities in the US is case in point. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good post, too bad most of the conversation took place on FB instead of here on the blog.

I have a critique, however, about the structure. You start your introduction with &quot;the conflict in the middle east&quot; and with a hopeful statement that it will be resolved soon. I share that hope. But then you go on with a discussion about Gaza, Hamas, Fatah for a few paragraphs. That could lead one to erroneously conclude that &quot;&lt;b&gt;the&lt;/b&gt; conflict in the Middle East&quot; is between the Arabs and Israel, but that isn&#039;t true. There are many conflicts in the Middle East (and beyond, yet still in the general area), almost always with Muslims on one side, the other, or both. And your conclusion that freedom is the antidote to those conflicts is spot-on! So let&#039;s hope that Islam, the kind of Islam that is practiced in much of the Middle East, can become compatible with freedom as quickly as possible.]]></description>
