		<description><![CDATA[you are missing my legal distinction (which isnt surprising).

in your &quot;R U Kidding&quot; example, that would be forcible rape.

the baby is not a punishment at all. but to those who would get free abortions instead its a deterrent.  And ill have you know that my views are all delivered up front and my wife of half a dozen years is perfectly fine with my point of view (and agrees).  As I hope my two daughters will as well... (but thanks for your snark/concern and thinly veiled ad hominem attack, its speaks volumes as to who you are and your intellectual capacity)

(whats being muddled here is that people are led to think that this means Abortion for rape is illegal.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  All it means is that tax payers, like you and me, dont have to foot the bill. (i think its an abuse of constitutional authority generally anyway, commerce clause be damned, but thats a discussion for a different time)

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;To say, &quot;u want to have sex at 14? guess what, u get pregnant, ur on your own.&quot; is just fine with me. will it make kids think twice b/c they wont be able to just walk into an abortion clinic and &quot;get rid&quot; of a baby? &quot;

 R U Kidding?!!!  Many children who have sex-do NOT become pregnant by other fourteen year olds. They are, more often than not, abused by a much older man...hence it is rape.

and PS. A baby is not a punishment for being the victim of a crime!!!! (There is so much more to address, but I don&#039;t have time for a disertation.) Do all women a favor and announce this stand to every woman you come into contact with-she deverves to know up front.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are very wrong about this. Incentives work to get the STATES to do what the FEDS want. EG speed limits. It has no effect on civilians.

And worse, there is no behavior that needs correcting other than for sickos to STOP RAPING people. If you are so concerned about incentivizing somebody you should incentivize rapists to STOP RAPING people forcibly or not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[no, they changed it b/c idiots on the left made it seem like republicans like rape.  its all marketing.

Do you think drinking age of 21 is a good thing? the only reason all states have it is so that they can get fed funding for road work (just like speed limits, Montana just caved and instituted them couple years back) the feds use monetary funding incentives ALL THE TIME to encourage what they think is good behavior.  To say, &quot;u want to have sex at 14? guess what, u get pregnant, ur on your own.&quot; is just fine with me. will it make kids think twice b/c they wont be able to just walk into an abortion clinic and &quot;get rid&quot; of a baby? Maybe, and thats good enough for me.

The ONLY downside to the legislation (and this is why i think it was really removed) is that you would have MORE rape convictions since more women/girls would allege forcible rape to get the free abortion and would result in more criminal prosecutions of innocent men/boys....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is no encouragement for better behavior here. It&#039;s twisted to even say that.

And you are beating an absolutely dead horse! The morons who wrote this bill with the word forcibly CHANGED it! Even they agree it was idiotic!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dani:

You are mistaken here. No one cares who the Feds &quot;like&quot;. However, when the Feds define something as serious as rape with a limiting definition it creates precedent for other statutes that may follow it to use the same definition. That would be bad. So you&#039;re right that it would have zero impact on current legislation, but it could have serious ramifications for FUTURE legislation.

And I can&#039;t believe you think that the way someone dresses impacts whether or not they will be raped. That&#039;s a gross statement and is simply wrong. Rapists rape whomever they choose regardless of how they are dressed. Women is burqas get raped all the time!

		<description><![CDATA[I dont know why EVERYONE got so mad about the forcible rape thing.  Forcible Rape would be defined to exclude &quot;date rape&quot; and statutory rape.  not when a woman is attacked in an alley and &quot;dosent resist&quot;.  it doesnt mean you &quot;like&quot; these kinds of rape, it just means fed funds cant be used to pay for it.  

lets say that there was a federal fund to pay for auto accident victims. but there was a clause that said that people who had a BAC of above .05 are not covered.  even though that is BELOW the standard in MANY states for legally intoxicated i dont think it means that the feds would LIKE ppl who are killed or maimed if they drank 1 beer and were a sleeping passenger in the car.  what it says is &quot;you want the fed funds, DONT DRINK and get into a car.&quot;  it is encouraging  specific behavior with a potential &quot;reward&quot;.  If you took Con Law 1, you know the feds do this ALL the time.

Maybe this forcible rape legislation was a way to send a message to youngters (and their parents) to &quot;NOT dress like a slut if you are 14&quot;, or &quot;DONT have sex in middle school with someone who is in college&quot;, or &quot;DONT go to a frat party and drink like a fish&quot;, or &quot;DONT hang out certain types of ppl&quot;, etc...

I dont have a problem with the legislation, as it would have had ZERO impact on existing legislation...]]></description>
