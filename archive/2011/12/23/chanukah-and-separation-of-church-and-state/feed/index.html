		<description><![CDATA[I disagree.  Judaism
does not separate between Church and State. Like Sunni Islam, it distinguishes the
Priest’s authority from the King’s but its legal system is derived entirely
from scripture. 


 


America&#039;s separation of  Church and State is an extension of a legal system derived not from
revelation but largely from an 18th century understanding of natural
law and natural rights. This offers the obvious advantage of denying religion
direct access to the mechanisms of State power; not only because of its
corrupting influences on both religion and the State because of the inevitable and devastating
consequences of religious coercion.


 


Unlike the West, however, Judaism does not create a distinction between religion and society; a distinction that denudes society of a
common identity rooted in traditional  moral and cultural references (see Richard
John Nehaus’ The Naked Public Square) and is largely responsible for the
conflict of values that informs much of contemporary life.

I think anyway you cut it, there is no way you can use ancient Judaism as a model for the seperation. At the least, it is no different than the medievel model.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;I think that a truer version of a separation between church and state originated with ancient Judaism.
What ancient Israel had was something like every European nation had during the medievel ages. There was a King, but there was a Pope controlling the afairs of the religion. Yet nobody would state that this was a separation of powers.

Also, if you read Nach, you can see, the king had ABSOLUTE power. ]]></description>
