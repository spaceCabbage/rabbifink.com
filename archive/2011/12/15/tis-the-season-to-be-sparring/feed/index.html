		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;
This was not our holiday. We were guests. It was uncomfortable.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

Yes.  You are a guest.  You live in a country where the majority religion and culture are different than your own.  That is how you are supposed to feel.

When American Jews want to practice milah, shechitah, erect an eruv, or put their children in Jewish schools; who is supportive, and who is opposed?

The devout Christians rally in support of the Jews.  The devout Atheists promulgate lies and deception to stop the Jews.

No one is forcing you to watch any Christmas parades.  No one requires you to pray in a church, or even to sing non-religious songs like Jingle Bells and Frosty the Snowman.

Just remember who our friends are when choosing sides of the War on Christmas.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whhhhyyyyyy???!!!

Because you feel offended. Hence, the narcissism. 

Trust me, I understand your logic of them not wanting to celebrate publicly. That I get. It&#039;s your core premise to how you get to that logic that I am talking about:

You taking offense. 

I am simply starting from the other side of the spectrum. I simply say to myself  that this is by far a largly Christian nation. That this holiday is sort of their &quot;staple&quot; holiday. That it means a lot to them. That public displays have a greater benefit to maintaining a somewhat faithful and traditional nation, therefore, all those are more important than MY personal feelings at this time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;First of all, it&#039;s not narcissism when a religious Jew is uncomfortable around Christian celebrations. It&#039;s normal. 
Uncomfortable, is quite different than feeling things should be taken down because it hurts your feelings. So this has nothing to do with you being a religious jew. It has more to do with a growing value stream (mostly from secular left) that take offense easily—especially with anything Christian— that you seem to be swept in.


&#062;Second of all, I can put my discomfort aside. And I do. But I can relate to people who don&#039;t feel they should have to. 
LOL. You put it aside because legally you can&#039;t just go up to the float and tear off the decorations. But even you admitted that things like this should not be tolerated.

&#062;Third of all, why do Christians need to have their celebrations and displays in public for 20% of the calendar year? Why can&#039;t they just celebrate in Church and at home? Why does it need to be in public? 
Why can&#039;t it be public? It&#039;s a largely Christian country. It&#039;s almost inevitable that an important holiday for them would sweep the nation, including in a public way. 


&#062;Fourth of all, in what way does Christmas add to the character of this nation? Unless by &#039;character&#039; you mean &#039;credit card debt&quot;?

The same way any holiday (including Jewish ones) add to the character of a nation. It helps preserve values, a common identity. Reminds the nation of perhaps something greater than their everyday life.

		<description><![CDATA[It is inclusive. The fact that you feel uncomfortable is your problem, not theirs. Maybe we should get rid of any festivities that might make others feel uncomfortable. 

It&#039;s what I said, there is some narcissism at play, even if a tinge. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[And yet, there is irony in everything here. I may be digging into this too much, but, in this post you claim offense at Christmas symbols that you feel are overwhelming you. How much abhorrence you would feel if they DID actually show religious symbols, I can only guess. In general, it is typically people of tradition and faith that want to keep this symbols and maintain a society of religious devotion. That a society built on faith is better than a secular society. Yet, on Dovbear&#039;s post on the death of Christopher Hitchens, — a man that despised any organized faith and belief in God — you say that you &quot;miss him already.&quot; This, all coming from a rabbi.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;But I do believe that public religious and symbolic displays that are Christmas and Christian-centric are not inclusive

Why does everything have to be inclusive??? Why are people so easily offended? That everything under the sun has to make you comfortable is rather childish. I mean, the very fact at getting offended by Christmas is as ridiculous as Arabs getting offended by Chanukah decorations in Israel. There has to be some sort of narcissism in play. I took my kids to Candy Cane lane in the Valley with the lights. They loved it. I loved it. I appreciate that this country is largely Christian and that not everything has to revolve around &quot;me&quot; and my feelings. I am actually happy, that OTHER&#039;S are happy and feel festive. 

This is the one time a year that make the atheists look bad. To purposely put &quot;anti-messages&quot; in a time when so many families bringing their children, look to these symblols of joy and inspiration, and to destroy it, is just so morally wrong in my opinion. They simply want to screw people and be &quot;davkanicks&quot;]]></description>
