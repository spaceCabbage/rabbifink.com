		<description><![CDATA[There is simply no evidence to suggest that a significant
number of Jews successfully combined Hellenism and Torah into a worldview at
once universalist and pious.  The Rabbis
deemphasized the contribution of the Hasmoniam to the Chanukah story not
because the latter was incapable of reconciling themselves to modernity but
because the religious authorities did not want to risk linking Torah observance
with militant and mercenary nationalism.


 


Likewise, your suggestion that the Talmud’s favorable opinion
of the Greek language, a prevailing familiarity with the natural sciences and
Yehudah HaNasi’s friendship with Antoninus, all point to a religious
sensibility comfortably integrated with modernity. Nothing could be further
from the truth. 


 


While it is true that tractate Megillah (9a) speaks
favorably of the Greek language, a clear distinction is made in tractate Sotah
(49b) between Greek language and Greek wisdom. 
This distinction is elaborated on in Bava Kamma (82b) where it is
reported that the Rabbis cursed any man who tought his son Greek wisdom.  In further discussion (83a), it is reported
in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel that ‘a thousand young men were in the
household of my father.  Five hundred
studied Torah and five hundred studied Greek wisdom.’  The discrepancy is resolved by acknowledging
that Rabban Gamliel’s household was different as its members were close to the
Roman monarchy, necessitating their familiarity with Greek wisdom.  This also explains R’ Yehudah HaNasi’s
intimacy with the same subject – it was a consequence of political necessity
and not intrinsic to Torah values.  The
same can be said for the Rabbi’s knowledge of mathematics and the natural
sciences. Absent such knowledge, many basic institutions of Jewish life, the
calendar, to site one obvious example, would be impossible.


 


If further evidence is wanting that the Rabbis wrote the
Hasmoneans out of the Chanukah story not because they lacked a spirit of
modernity but because they represented an uncompromisingly brutal and
reactionary spirit within Judaism, it can be found in the educational system
that pious Jews established from the end of the second century BCE.  The Greek gymnasia (the forerunner to the
modern university) was replaced with a network of religious institutions whose curriculum
rejected any secular influence in favor of a syllabus devoted entirely to
religious study.  


 


While typical of your style, your presentation was original,
succinct and refreshingly lacking in sentimental appeal, I felt your remarks
were intended to provoke rather then instruct. 
It that regard, you succeeded splendidly.     ]]></description>
