		<description><![CDATA[I think the point of saying the &quot;palestinians&quot; are a made up people is that they don&#039;t have any claim to the land they want. I agree with you that all countries are theoretically &quot;made up&quot; before they become a sovereign nation but the point is that the &quot;palestinians&quot; should go take land from Jordan not from Israel!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The distinction is important, because it determines the starting point for peace negotiations.

If there had been a native people called the Palestinians, and then invading Europeans showed up and destroyed the Palestinian culture, and replaced it with their own - then the proper starting point for negotiations is that the original Palestinians deserve all of the land, and anything less than that is a magnanimous gesture on their part.

If, however, there was a concerted effort among Arab leaders to destroy the Jewish people, as they tried to REclaim their ancestral homeland - and when their military efforts to anhiliate the Jews failed, they launched a war of taqiyya by inventing a native people called &quot;Palestinian&quot;, who were actually Arabs from various Arab lands perpetrated this fraud to arouse world sympathy for these Jew-killing terrorists...

If that is what really happened, then the proper starting point for negotiations is that the Arab squatters get nothing; and any concession (say, an Arab nation in Gaza only) is a gracious effort on the part of the Jews who miraculously survived several attempts at genocide at the hands of the Arabs.

Gingrich has the courage to let the world know that the second scenario is the truth.  G-d bless him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very nice article. I completely agree with Rabbi Fink. This whole debate seems very irrelevant. We (Israel) have to deal with the disputed territories and the people living there, and whether you call them Palestinians or Arabs living in Eretz Israel or whatever, I don&#039;t see what difference it makes to finding a solution. Personally, I&#039;m against a Palestinian state, but not because there is or is not a Palestinian people, but rather, because I believe such a state would endanger the state of Israel, and would not be a viable state. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The comments reminded me of a tech blog post that made the rounds. The blogger was arguing that your average programmer was awful. As part of his argument, he posted a relatively simple problem and said 50% or more of his interviewees couldn&#039;t solve it. 90% of the comments revolved around the best way to solve the problem.

So many of your comments (including on Facebook) are &quot;Invented!&quot;/&quot;Not Invented!&quot;... you would think people read the blog post they&#039;re commenting on before commenting.

I completely agree by the way: Newt&#039;s comment also did exactly what it was supposed to: Curry favor with those who (want to) think the Palestinians are invented. I&#039;m going to guess there&#039;s plenty of those who live in Iowa.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes - by a people who was there at the time it was invented and claimed to be part of it as it was being invented. Which is completely different than claiming a nation existed after in fact it did not exist, as Gingrich says clearly. Here&#039;s his actual statement: 


&quot;Remember, there was no Palestine as a state. It was part of the Ottoman Empire. We have invented the Palestinian people, who are in fact Arabs and are historically part of the Arab people, and they had the chance to go many places.&quot;
&quot;For a variety of political reasons,&quot; Gingrich continued, &quot;we have sustained this war against Israel now since the 1940s, and I think it&#039;s tragic.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The implication is clearly that Palestinians should stop whining and go away. That&#039;s exactly Gingrich meant. 
I am arguing that Gingrich should not have implied that simply because they are, in his eyes, invented. As everyone is invented. 
Is this so complicated?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wait, what&#039;s the implication? I thought u just said that his comment was no different than saying American are invented? See, u even know what the meaning of his statement is. In fact, it was SO meaningful that a the comment, made on some rinky dink tv channel (sorry Steven I.) made it to the nationally televised TV debate on a major broadcast network. 

It means something, and it means something HUGE. It is very different, and you already know that. Stop being so silly.

(and while there may be no contraction here, there most certainly won&#039;t be expansion, see Palestinian bid for statehood failure at UN)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So let me get this straight, Newt&#039;s comment is silly b/c it&#039;s not saying anything really since all people&#039;s are &quot;invented&quot;, is that it? If that&#039;s the case, and his comments really aren&#039;t saying anything more than Palestine ms are &quot;invented&quot; just like Americans, then why the huge backlash from the palestinans? Clearly they understood the nuance you failed to grasp.

I&#039;ll put it really simplified terms. In the NHL you have the original 6 teams. They carry some historical heritage, mistique, tradition, and majesty. Now the league expands and new expansion teams are created which have no tradition, history, or mistique. Years go by and it time for the league to contract. U think the NHL is going to rid of the Rangers? bruins? Etc.? Or are they going to jettison Atlanta or Phoenix? But why? They aree all just invented teams? 

(you can make the appropriate NBA analogy, I just don&#039;t know enough about the NBA to make it fit as I still thought the supersonics were a team as I stopped watching back in the Shawn kemp days)]]></description>

British colonies which existed as such and in which the people within it chose to rebel together against the current government, and ultimately went to war and founded their own government.
