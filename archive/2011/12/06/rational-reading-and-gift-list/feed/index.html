		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I don&#039;t think R&#039; Lampel would necessarily approve of the conclusions I drew from his book.  Online, he seems pretty conservative.  But the sources he brings admit of more liberal readings than he uses them for.  


But the Rambam allows for Oral Torah minimalism - there&#039;s no real need to accept more than the 37 listed Halachot Lemoshe Misinai as being necessarily part of the Divine Oral Torah.  We assume that other material, e.g. some universally-agreed Hilchot Shabbat, and meat/milk, etc., must be Divine in origin, but Chazal still found drashot for most of them, so they don&#039;t necessarily have to be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[might I suggest Rambam&#039;s intro to the Mishnah commentary?  I don;t know which translation is best, I struggled through the Hebrew.  It, plus R&#039; Zvi Lampel&#039;s &quot;The Dynamics of &lt;strike&gt;an asteroid&lt;/strike&gt; Dispute&quot;, convinced me that a Divine-originated Oral Torah was plausible, despite the 3300-year telephone game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t agree with that assessment. Many of the sources are just examples of not taking the 13 ikkerim as literally and seriously as we take them now. Further, it is still important to know that the 13 ikkerim are not as universal as we think. That is a good thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree with your endorsement of &quot;The Limits of Orthodox Theology&quot;. As many reviews of the book pointed out, it essentially disproves its own thesis, demonstrating that it is indeed true that nearly all of the authorities whose names we would recognize did agree with the substance of Maimonides&#039; 13 principles. Many of the &quot;sources&quot; suggesting otherwise are written by obscure scholars who are only known for the fact that they believed something contrary to the 13 principles.]]></description>
