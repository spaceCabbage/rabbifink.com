		<description><![CDATA[I would be happy to lead a discussion on this topic. Y.U. 
needs someone to facilitate a conversion regarding having loyalty to Y.U.  and 
creating a safe forum for students to discuss issues of concern. Y.U. is a 
fantastic school and I have spent most of my life there as either a student or 
teacher. I am greatly disturbed by the bad press this article has created. No 
other institution can match torah umadah which is communicated at Y.U. Let us 
graduates and students have pride in our fantastic place of Torah learning .

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder whether they would have had the same reaction if the  Beacon article had been about how the author committed Lashon Hara on her blog.

I remember a news article from the 1980s where the local Orthodox rabbi was commenting on the first gay Reform rabbi in town.  He made special mention of the fact that the gay rabbi was committing acts for which capital punishment was the penalty prescribed by Torah, and that was part of the reason why he had problems with gay rabbis.  Meanwhile this same Orthodox rabbi was perfectly happy to serve on communal committees (I.e. Jewish family services, etc.) with Reform Rabbis, even female reform rabbis who routinely violated Shabbos, at least violated it according too the understanding of the Orthodox rabbi.

The problem here is that Jewish tradition is totally, completely, and absolutely irrational about the code sexual behavior.  There may be good reasons to discourage total sexual promiscuity, but why the freak out when people slip?  I&#039;m sure that the folks who smoke on Shabbos, or are ba&#039;alei lashon hara don&#039;t wallow in the same shame that some heterosexual person endures because they happen to have consensual sex with someone who is permitted to them, but they just hap[pen not to be married.  And forget about the poor gay folks, they are made to feel like dirt if they commit the act, but people who violate many other halachot go on their merry way with little sense of shame at all.  After all, as it&#039;s pointed out in tefilla zaka, it is impossible to observe everything all the time.

I have come to the conclusion, after much life experience, that the Torah&#039;s code of sexual behavior didn&#039;t come from God, it came straight out of the tortured minds of a bunch of Bronze Age neurotics who had some really serious issues about their own sexuality.]]></description>

We accept lots of students who don&#039;t have the Torah U&#039;Maddah philosophy because they are to the right but still want an undergraduate education (or think they do, or have parents who think they should), or because they are from less observant backgrounds and want to try a more observant lifestyle (or have parents who think they should).

I don&#039;t think this was handled well -- by anyone. The article is not the kind of thing that belonged in a frum publication; I&#039;m surprised the editors accepted it. But the administration guaranteed a massive amount of publicity by doing something that looked like &quot;censorship&quot; even though it absolutely has the right to police what student organizations it funds are doing. I haven&#039;t seen so much publicity for YU in the national media in the ten years I&#039;ve been there. Is this really the kind of publicity we want? How about all the students learning huge amounts of Torah and taking it on the road to teach others? How about the students who traveled to Maryland last year to protest in support of a woman who is an agunah? How about all the students who do chesed projects all over, including helping to staff a free medical clinic in the Bronx? How about all the medical research that could save lives? I could go on and on!

		<description><![CDATA[@facebook-6013153:disqus Of course there isn&#039;t any personal honor code at YU. It&#039;s a Jewish college, and Jews already have a honor code. If these kids got to age 19 and they need their college to tell them how to live as Jews, we have a problem. And this by the way, is the very problem in Chraredi Judaism. Meaning the Chardei rabbis dont trust their their own education system accomplished anything and therefore they need chumrot on top of chumrot. YU may have faith in students or not, but it really doesn&#039;t need to anyway. 

And by the way, this essay could have been written by a member of any other yeshiva on this planet, not just YU.

Also, last years story about the BYU basketball player who was suspended from the team for premarital sex.

		<description><![CDATA[Well said.  Unfortunately, the way many of the commentators framed the issue, it became a contest between Torah values and American/Western/Constitutional values.  If the question is framed that way, there can only be one answer - at least if YU want&#039;s to keep that &quot;Y.&quot;  Perhaps it would have been more productive to take the triumph of the Torah value - tznius, nivul peh, arayos, what have you - as a given, and then debate whether the article did in fact breech any inviolable Torah barriers.  Within the context of that discussion it would have been also useful to distinguish between (1) the message of the article, (2) the way that message was expressed, (3) the Beacon&#039;s decision to relay that message through this medium (as apposed to the far more objective and intellectual way another student argued for franker discussion about real sexual issues in a previous edition of the Beacon), (4) the fact that the article was not placed to express a message at all, but as a creative writing piece.

Framed this way, the issue becomes a halachic question, or at least a Torah-policy question, that could perhaps have been answered by YU&#039;s Torah authorities in a sympathetic, understanding, and nuanced way.  (I hope for too much, I&#039;m sure).

In the end, the fact that the discussion was largely not premised on the absolute triumph of Torah values, but instead entertained the possibility that Free Speech in a university should control, is troubling and really raises the question about where YU is as a Torah Umadda (or any other Torah-and-something) institution.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your thoughts.

I went simplistic partially because the Kiddush Hashem / Chillul Hashem analysis is uber-simplistic and fallacious in my opinion. 
I also disagree with your comparison to BYU. I was planning on doing a post about an incident there before this incident at YU. I then considered combining the two. Perhaps soon I will get to the BYU post. 
My lack of first hand information about YU, the Rav and his version of Torah U&#039;Mada precludes me from forming a real opinion on the questions you raise. Although, if I could, I would.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I went to YU for a year (1999/2000), the episode seems rather reflective of my experience. I used to say at the time that 80% of the student body didn&#039;t want to be there: 40% would rather be at Columbia, and another 40% would rather be at NIRC. The combined 80% didn&#039;t really buy into Torah U&#039;Mada, and rather view it as some sort of compromise. 

A similar situation happened during my year: A gay student ran for a student council position (I believe VP): He had two opponents who were on the frummer side of things. During the week before the election, rabbanim in shiur encouraged students to not vote for &quot;people whose values didn&#039;t reflect the school&quot;, and one of the two opponents was basically forced to drop out to not split the vote. In the end, he did not win, but refused to make a stink out of it. He said he liked the school, and knew that media attention would reflect poorly on YU.

Viewing the Beacon story in a simple what&#039;s positive/negative is rather simplistic: It cuts to the core problems of the YU: A fundamental gap between the school&#039;s philosophy and (portions of) the student body. This sort of thing would never happen in say BYU: Students buy in to Mormonism, make their pledges, keep their pledges, or they leave. Contrast that with YU where you won&#039;t have a hard time finding students who don&#039;t really buy into Torah, perhaps fewer who don&#039;t buy into Mada, and very very few students who buy into the Soleveichik Torah/Mada enhance each other philosophy.

Perhaps you should address how/why YU came to have such a gap, whether it&#039;s a problem, and how should they go moving forward.]]></description>
