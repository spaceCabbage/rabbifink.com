		<description><![CDATA[Actually, the presenter of the conference created a museum in Boro Park and it is full of artifacts that relate to the words and their meanings in the Torah, and Gemorah etc. That includes artifacts from many of the situations the Yehudim found themselves in. In Egypt, Roman occupation, animals, etc. You can imagine what that entails. Many Gedolim have visited the museum, as well as many Jews of Brooklyn and elsewhere. 

Billing it as an archaeology conference was a bit misleading and may alarm the more extreme elements of  charedim, as it may cause some to envision the archaeology of Eretz Yisrael and then compare it to the Torah. The presenter begins with the Items enumerated in the Torah itself and seeks out the archaeological item and displays it with the relative pasuk.. It really is fascinating. His purpose is to create a closer understanding of between the physicality and the words that students are learning. I.e., the Chashmonaim minted coins. On parchment it is a statement, but to actually see such a coin with the words engraved thereon, that might have just learned elicits quite another intellectual and realistic picture, not to validate,but to bring alive.

However, the way you write about it sounds like the audience is an archaeological find themselves, being exposed to modernity...&quot; finally&quot;. The Torah has no end, it is a deep well, from which to drink.]]></description>
