		<description><![CDATA[BS addressed most of the point I would have made.

I think you are confusing criticism with bias. One of the greatest anti-NYT lies is that a criticism is tantamount to bias. I find this offensive.

And your last paragraph tells me you don&#039;t read this blog often. If you did, I doubt you would say I am &quot;closed minded&quot; to party lines.

Finally, you challenge me to highlight the NYT? How about you read it...? :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My argument is not that their substance is anti Israel (like I said Friedman is right on a lot of points) it is their form that gives it away. Name calling, such as Friedman&#039;s referral to Israel as inbred, I agree is certainly the easy way out of an intelligent debate. Nobody said anything about being right wing or that their agenda is right either. Does the average person who reads the Times walk away feeling positive towards Israel, a true American ally, or negative?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The NYT shares the agenda of Ehud Barak, Tzipi Livni, Shimon Peres etc. That doesn&#039;t make then anti Israel. You don&#039;t have to be a right winger to be a &quot;great American&quot; and you don&#039;t have to be a right winger to be pro Israel. You&#039;re point about Thomas Friedman shows your own bias. He is the furthest thing from ant Israel. He has a viewpoint that 45 years of settlements has hurt the chances for peace, not helped them. It&#039;s hard to argue with that but even if you do, his positions are reasoned policy positions, not &quot;anti Israel&quot; positions. Name calling is the easy way out of an intelligent debate.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You says you read the New York Times yet you say you don&#039;t see the anti-Israel bias...are you sure you are reading the New York Times? Their anti-Israel sentiment is clear. Whether it&#039;s their refusal to refer to suicide bombers as terrorists or hiding terrorist attacks on page 13 while putting Israeli &quot;invasions&quot; into Palestinian territory on the front page, their agenda is clear. How about columnists such as Thomas Friedman, who I happen to think is brilliant and love reading his articles, refer to Israel as &quot;inbred&quot;. Though he may be an excellent writer and is right on a lot of the points he makes, his disdain for Israel is evident in his writing. He only reluctantly recognizes Israel as an ally. We can even go as far back as WW II and the Times&#039; refusal to print any stories about the holocaust. This is only the tip of the iceberg. The Times over the Years is replete with example of their anti-israel bias. 
I think that you suffer from something many Jews, especially more liberal Jews, suffer from. In an attempt to be an &quot;open minded&quot; person many Jews bend over backwards to try and block out anti-semitism or anti Israel bias in a feeble attempt to argue that it does not exist or that it is not as rampant as reality suggests. These &quot;open minded&quot; Jews are just as closed minded as people like Sean Hannity and Ruth Bader-Ginsburg who strictly adhere to their own party lines and are great examples of the close minded individuals of the far right and the far left. So take a deep breath, clear your mind, straighten yourself up and read the paper again today, tomorrow, the day after, highlight what you think is pro-Israel and what you think is anti-Israel then make a true non-biased decision of the NY Times&#039; feelings on Israel. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You can apply your last line to any rational sect in the world.  I would like to see sources when you make blanket statements like these.   Judaism has a tradition - I just don&#039;t know all (most) of it.  ]]></description>
