		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re being unfair to the Karaites.  They have plenty of Oral Torah which they live by religiously.  Nowhere in the Tanach does it say to go to a house of worship, take off your shoes, and bow to the ground in prayer twice daily.  Nowhere does it say that one is required to fast on the 10th of Av.  It doesn&#039;t say how to slaughter meat - yet Karaites do all of these things.

It&#039;s completely impossible to live any kind of coherent religious practice following only what is written in the Tanach.  Either you follow the existing mesorah or you make up your own along the way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s interesting you brought this up. I really respect this woman, because those evangelicals can be nuts. I just had a &quot;conversation&quot; with an Evangelical Christian blogger on a certain site who was so hard-line, closeminded and paranoid, I thought I was on Imamother. 
It was actually worse- it&#039;s the first site I ever got banned from. She called me a troll, which is weird, because I ended up on her site by her liking one of my posts. I got banned within a couple of days. Might be because I&#039;m a joo. 
Just looked up the site. It&#039;s called &quot;Fellowship of the minds&quot;. Didn&#039;t they call that Groupthink in 1984?...]]></description>
