		<description><![CDATA[Personally I never really saw much problem with the bracha. It acknowledges a simple fact that women have it worse off than men (then and now). Not that men are somehow inherently better than women simply by virtue of being men, but due to unfortunate realities of sexism.


Similarly, I often am grateful for the fact that I am white. Not because I am a racist of any sort, but simply because in the Western world it is usually a pretty nice advantage (for instance, I am pretty unlikely to be shot to death if I get into an altercation with law enforcement).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; Eli, I didn&#039;t realize u had such Yichus (R&#039; Elya fantastically genius and helpful Lev Eliyahu is one of the few mainstays on shabbos afternoon from my yeshiva days)! Guess you have the backing (like R Elazar Ben Azarya) to be a leader and stand up against some of the torah highjackers threatening judaism today. keep it up!

		<description><![CDATA[Ich mein:

The blessing is offensive whether one is a feminist or not. And being a feminist can&#039;t possibly be grounds for exclusion from orthodoxy. That is insane.

What has been detrimental about what you call the feminist agenda?

As to Rabbi Tendler&#039;s opinion, while I value his opinion and consider him a rebbe and mentor of mine, I don&#039;t think that his opinion would be dispositive. That being said, I am sure RT would say something like &quot;people shouldn&#039;t be so sensitive&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nonsense, Professor.  We can change as much as we want - as long as it involves ADDING things to Jewish practice and making a halachic lifestyle MORE burdensome (especially if the burden falls largely on others); its when you try to take things away and reduce the degree of halachic  regulation that you become a reformer. *Tongue in cheek*]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the bracha has been properly defended as thanking Hashem for the additional mitzvos.  I think the better question is, why don&#039;t women have a bracha thanking Hashem for the special responsibilities that they are given?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; Fink,
I agree that Rabbi Shafran could have used better arguments than just attacking Kanefsky and claiming that nothing ever changes.  I think Rabbi Shafran&#039;s real problem is his objection to the feminist movement, and the fact that Kanefsky appears to be endorsing and even promoting the feminist agenda.  As such, I agree that Kanefsky should be tossed from the Orthodox rabbinate, having personally observed the detrimental effect that the feminist movement has had on the frum world.
As a fellow Mechinas Ner Yisrael bochur (who only lasted one year there), I must ask, what do you think Rabbi Tendler would say about this?

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad Rabbi Shafran has informed me that nothing in Judaism can change. He has just patured me from much of pesukei d&#039;zimra and tachanun, almost the entirety of selichot, most of the yomim noraim service, all the minhagim specific to simchat torah, and kabalat Shabat, as all are post-Chazal innovations that render the people who introduced them non-Orthodox. I will be able to spend a lot less time in shul now. ]]></description>
