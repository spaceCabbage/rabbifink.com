		<description><![CDATA[Morty,

I didn&#039;t hear any criticism of Rubashkin in this article. Rather, it seems to be introspection as to why we feel the emotional need to defend one person more than another. People make mistakes and it is true that it is not our place to judge them. However, in the traditions of the Ba&#039;alei Mussar, introspection regarding the motivation of our actions, either as individuals or as a community, is always important... particularly before Rosh Hashana.Eliyahu,

It continues to amaze me how our Jewish brethren are becoming more and more affected by American society and its inability to remove oneself from a situation emotionally in order to assess it intellectually.... All the attributes associated with Chochma - ro&#039;eh es hanolad, lomeid mikol adam, et al - are becoming fewer and farther between. :(

Kesiva V&#039;Chasima Tova to all!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes. I did write that the sentence is egregious. I invite you to read that post. It is linked in the intro to this one. 
The point of this post is to demonstrate a systematic, deliberate attempt to defraud the bank. This stands in contrast to the frum news reports that Ruashkin is innocent. 
Land of the free? HA! Did you know that over 1% of Americans are incarcerated at this very moment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Overstating invoices that allowed him to increase his loan by 12 million dollars, a loan that he probably fully intended to fully repay is a crime, that is all that was proven. It is not a crime that deserves more than a couples years, MAX. And the Iowa prosecutors, I believe, conspired with the judge to put him away as long as they can, I don&#039;t know why.

I also don&#039;t know why there are rational people not supporting Rubashkin. 27 years is not just overboard, it is hair-raising. It is hard to fathom that this can happen in America - the land of the free.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Leave it. Your opinion is completely off course. Actually the real community support started around the time of his arrest, before then he had no support at all except from family and friends. What really got his support going, was when the judge denied him bail because of the law of return, that&#039;s when sympathies really started changing in favor of Rubashkin. It then grew as the prosecutors became more and more overzealous and the judge more unfair, and a Chareidi newspaper very much sympathized with Rubashkin and reported it. It further grew when he was outrageously sentenced to 27 years!! If you would only open your eyes, you would realize how right they are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I made my kitchen kosher when Rubashkin was a minor player in the kosher meat biz.  Before that, I went out of my way to buy kosher hot dogs, etc. because they were of superior quality.  My Mom used to serve Empire Turkeys for holidays and such, even though she, too, didn&#039;t have a strictly kosher kitchen.  Then Rubashkin came in and rolled over the other kosher meat producers the way Wal-Mart rolled over local retail.  And what I found when I sampled their product was that it was dreck.  Oscar Meyer makes better quality hot dogs.  The meat is tough and gristly.  And the difference in prices isn&#039;t really all that much.  I&#039;ve gone back to using a local butcher who buys locally slaughtered meat.  Sure, it&#039;s more expensive, but even so, the cost of meat is a very small part of my food budget, and the better quality is worth it.  After all, food is something I put in my body, why should I eat dreck?

There&#039;s another factor you didn&#039;t mention, and that&#039;s the book &quot;Postville, a Clash of Cultures&quot; by a non-Orthodox Jewish guy from Iowa who went to Postville, tried to connect to the community as a way to reconnect to his Jewish roots, and, in the end, wrote a warts and all account of the way the Hasidim were turning the place upside down.  I guess one could consider it one of the most spectacular failure of Habad kiruv ever documented.  Because most frum people are so emotionally invested in kiruv (my observation), I think the book caused some reflexive unconscious support for Rubashkin at being dissed by the infidel apikoris who missed his opportunity to become frum. 

To this day, I avoid eating Rubashkins, or whatever they call it now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[PETA has been the foe of jews for years.  remember when they ran to condemn the PLO for using donkeys to carry explosives to kills jews.  yea, lets not condemn them for killing innocents, lets focus on the poor donkey.  Idiots.

I think this is the first time that there was a high profile (really no one outside of Iowa or the jewish community knows who rubashkin is, so i use the term loosely) case that impacts all of us since we have all bought meat from there.  Kosher meat is already expensive and shuttering the plant or bankrupting it will only increase already (illegally?) inflated prices.

in addition, i think it can, with all honesty be said, that rubashkin received a less than fair trial, given the procedural and evidentiary rulings of the trial court.  I think he would have received a sentence of 7-14 years barring those errors at trial.

the fraud was extensive, and the punishment harsh, but the fact that it impacts all of us and we feel it more (more than the dozens of welfare fraudsters in monsey who were arrested over the last few years) makes ppl get emotional about it.

MY OPINION.]]></description>
