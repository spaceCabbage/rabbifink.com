		<description><![CDATA[I think Rafi raises an interesting point. There are certainly young men and women raised Orthodox 
who try this experiment in reverse, particularly on college campuses. But they typically try out secular Judaism, rather than Reform. Many find their prior observance to be rote and lacking meaning. Faced with the enticements of what a full campus life offers when there are no religious restrictions or obligations,
they abandon Orthodoxy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve done it.  I was fully observant within the context of Reform Judaism.  Friday night services were a lot of fun.  The guitar led singing, the spiritually uplifting melodies of Debbie Friedman, a&quot;h, were fantastic.  

Of course, they looked at me like I was mentally ill when I wouldn&#039;t hug women, as everyone hugged each other and wished each other Shabbat Shalom afterwards.  They winced at the idea that I would not eat the food at the &quot;oneg&quot;, since it was not prepared under kosher supervision.  They were stunned to silence when someone offered me a ride, and I had to decline, and explain that I was walking the three miles to my home.

It was a very uncomfortable situation, I tried doing it for many months, and finally I simply gave up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How is this even possible?

A Reform Jew can&#039;t learn all of the blessings, learn how to pray a full prayer service, learn how to keep kosher at home, how to fully keep shabbat etc - all in one week.

It&#039;s an interesting premise, but I don&#039;t accept that she actually lived as a frum Jew for a week.  It just isn&#039;t possible.

Even if she would have hired a &quot;minder&quot; of sorts, saying &quot;now do this, now wear that, now eat this, say this, repeat after me, &quot; etc - that&#039;s not observance!

It takes several months, if not years, for a non-frum Jew to learn how to live a frum life, and to unlearn everything that Reform has taught them about practical observance.

I believe that she &lt;i&gt;thinks&lt;/i&gt; she was frum for a week, but I highly doubt that she really was.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;She didn’t profess to believe in the 13 Fundamentals of Faith. She has 
not accepted “Torah M’Sinai”. And yet, it has worked. She has enjoyed 
it. She has learned from it. It has changed her life.&quot;

Did it really work?  At the end of the week, she went back to being a Reform Jew.

By the way, I&#039;d be more interested to read about an Orthodox Jew who tries out being Reform for a week.  (That is possible, as Reform Judaism teaches that one can observe whatever one finds meaningful, so one could be fully Orthodox-style observant within the context of Reform Judaism.)  Than maybe, the bashing from both sides will diminish ]]></description>
