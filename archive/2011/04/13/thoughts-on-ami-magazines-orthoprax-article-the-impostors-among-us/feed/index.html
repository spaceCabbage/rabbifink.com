		<description><![CDATA[@efink:disqus  I agree with your  analysis of the witch hunt atmosphere that exists. It&#039;s made so apparent by all the steps the author takes to distance himself from the evil orthopraxers, like saying &#039;I have nothing in common with this witch&#039; at the end. By even bringing up the issue, even to knock it, he sees himself as suspect. 


However, your analysis is lacking a major point. You say, &quot;There are people who are skeptics. It is their nature.&quot; That leaves it at a very superficial level. I think Dr. Sorotzkin has a much more informed take in his article &quot;On the role of parents&quot; drsorotzkin.com/role_of_parents.html. Some people see Judaism as comfort food, like Rav Moshe Weinberger of Aish kodesh here: youtube.com/watch?v=uKl9oOqDKZQ To people like this, speaking about the truth or untruth of Judaism is very theoretical. He likes it, and he wants to stay. 


To other people, Judaism is another form of oppression, foisted on them by their parents and authority to manipulate them. Fear/hatred of authority is what makes many people skeptics. Regardless of the &quot;truth&quot;, if they were forced to do it, they are resistant. 


In the end, I believe that logic has little to do with 99% of people&#039;s choice to accept or reject a particular faith. I wrote apost on this a while back here: jewishdepression.blogspot.com/2010/11/13-thanksgiving.html

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree. This suggests we aren&#039;t allowed to change our mind, since we must make up our mind. On the contrary, practicing even while in a &quot;crisis&quot; of faith shows a strong commitment to the religion and to the community, and a faith in the system even if this faith lacks belief. While I&#039;m sure that some have &quot;made up their minds&quot; and simply just don&#039;t believe, for most people it is more complicated than that, and may vary day-by-day.

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,

I&#039;ve never followed your blog before, but I caught this piece, and I thought it was one of the most beautifully elucidated articles that I&#039;ve read in some time.

I think that, if more people read your post here instead of that dreck in &quot;AMI Magazine&quot;, we might have lot more people who felt accepted in the Orthodox Jewish community, instead of being pushed away. Or, at least, felt more comfortable about their faith and how to approach Judaism, whichever movement they might choose to follow.

As a bit of a &quot;reject&quot; from the frum community, I feel deep disappointment over the failure of the Orthodox community to come to grips with its internal issues, especially in regard to those who are confused about emunah and observance. I hope that one day, people like the author of the AMI article might realize that: many of these &quot;heretics&quot; are lost and alone, and many of them wish that they could believe. And it hurts.

Kudos.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If a person believes in living an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle, without admitting that Hashem exists, fine.  To each his own.  I think that was Mordechai Kaplan&#039;s idea originally.

However, if that person does not share his views openly, and continues to pass himself off as a believer, then he is a fraud.  

If a frum woman is marrying such a man, on condition that he believes in Hashem, then the marriage is void, according to halacha.

The question is, is that an implied condition when two frum-looking, frum-acting people get married?  I would say yes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your comments are appreciated but betray a deep misunderstanding of Judaism and Orthoprax Jews. Not everyone who doesn&#039;t believe in God is a hedonist. I know that sounds crazy, but really it&#039;s true. Atheists have morals and sometimes, believe it or not, believers ARE hedonists and DO NOT have morals. Crazy right?

Also, belief in God is on aspect of a very detailed and beautiful lifestyle. One can enjoy it, believe in its importance and still not believe in God.

They are only frauds because people like you call them frauds and couch Judaism and morality in terms that may or may not be as clearly defined as you think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I personally don&#039;t care how many people want to leave frumkeit.  Those coming and those going tend to balance each other out.  I&#039;m much more interested in quality of people than quantity.


I just wish that these people from frum homes would have the guts to actually leave.  Deny thy father, refuse thy name.  Become another John Smith in atheist America.  I respect individuals who have enough backbone to follow their convictions and switch societies, as well as clothing.

I can only describe these Orthoprax types as pathetic.  I&#039;m glad that the article called these people what they are - frauds.  They must be exposed.  Then, they can make an honest choice between the hard path of tshuvah or the easy road to hedonism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I posted this comment on dovbear as well, but then realized the post originated here. 
 
I rather liked this insightful look into the issues facing orthoprax (what an awful name. Sounds like a villain from captain planet) Jews. Clearly, the definitions of Jewish identity continue to stretch in many direction. But I can also understand the problems people have with people who practice orthodox judaism, yet fail to believe in many of its fundamental tennets.  
 
Personally, I could never adhere to a system of rituals and commandments when I wasn&#039;t even relatively confident in their origin. Of course, every religion has components of faith, occasionally blind, but if one is unable to make these leaps, partaking in the physical components seems to be at least moderately dishonest, intellectually. What is seems these people need to do is reevaluate what they believe in and allow their actions to follow those thoughts. The reasons people avoid this range from ignorance to apathy to fear to societal pressure, but none of them are really an adequate excuse for avoiding the simple mature act of making up your mind.  
 
Great post. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

		<description><![CDATA[Hide the women and children!  The Orthoprax are here!

If this &quot;scare&quot; piece is what passes for journalism in our frum communities, then we shouldn&#039;t be in that business at all.

Anyone who can use the sentence &quot;adults who are duplicitous, heretical infiltrators within the ranks of our communities&quot; to describe these people is so ridiculously clueless that it made it very hard to read the remainder of the article.  He makes them sound like a foreign &quot;fifth column&quot; or sleeper agents, who invade our communities waiting for the right time to strike.  Ummm, no.

These folks are our brothers, sisters, cousins, parents, friends, classmates - people who have grown up alongside us, gone to school with us, learned as we did, etc.  Why not be more concerned with WHY they believe the way they do, than with calling them names (disturbed, sick, emotionally unstable, etc.)?  Most professionals in the psychology field would disagree with these pronouncements, I believe.

Does &quot;outing&quot; them and/or kicking them out of the community help them more than, say, helping them work through what they believe and why, and helping try to steer them back to emunah?  If the only help you can offer them is to say &quot;You need to have emunah, and if you don&#039;t, then you&#039;re a kofer&quot; is no help at all - in fact, that attitude is more than likely a major reason why they are in their current states.  If Eli showed up at my door to take out my daughter, I&#039;d like to think that the values and beliefs that have been instilled in my daughter would cause her to try and help him, rather than slam the door in his face.  

Also, Orthopraxy has been around for a while - a lot longer than the Internet has.  So the Internet is an easy scapegoat here - yes, the Internet makes it easier, but the REAL cause of Orthopraxy is a combination of INFORMATION and A FAILURE ON THE PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES LEADERS OF KNOWING HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION.  Specifically, information from the outside world that the insularity of Chareidi communities keep out.  And then, the response of community leaders to debase, defrock and ban, rather than outreach, teach and accept.

That is MY Yahadut; I can see what THEIRS is...]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hide the women and children!  The Orthoprax are here!</p>
<p>If this &#8220;scare&#8221; piece is what passes for journalism in our frum communities, then we shouldn&#8217;t be in that business at all.</p>
<p>Anyone who can use the sentence &#8220;adults who are duplicitous, heretical infiltrators within the ranks of our communities&#8221; to describe these people is so ridiculously clueless that it made it very hard to read the remainder of the article.  He makes them sound like a foreign &#8220;fifth column&#8221; or sleeper agents, who invade our communities waiting for the right time to strike.  Ummm, no.</p>
<p>These folks are our brothers, sisters, cousins, parents, friends, classmates &#8211; people who have grown up alongside us, gone to school with us, learned as we did, etc.  Why not be more concerned with WHY they believe the way they do, than with calling them names (disturbed, sick, emotionally unstable, etc.)?  Most professionals in the psychology field would disagree with these pronouncements, I believe.</p>
<p>Does &#8220;outing&#8221; them and/or kicking them out of the community help them more than, say, helping them work through what they believe and why, and helping try to steer them back to emunah?  If the only help you can offer them is to say &#8220;You need to have emunah, and if you don&#8217;t, then you&#8217;re a kofer&#8221; is no help at all &#8211; in fact, that attitude is more than likely a major reason why they are in their current states.  If Eli showed up at my door to take out my daughter, I&#8217;d like to think that the values and beliefs that have been instilled in my daughter would cause her to try and help him, rather than slam the door in his face.  </p>
<p>Also, Orthopraxy has been around for a while &#8211; a lot longer than the Internet has.  So the Internet is an easy scapegoat here &#8211; yes, the Internet makes it easier, but the REAL cause of Orthopraxy is a combination of INFORMATION and A FAILURE ON THE PART OF OUR COMMUNITIES LEADERS OF KNOWING HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION.  Specifically, information from the outside world that the insularity of Chareidi communities keep out.  And then, the response of community leaders to debase, defrock and ban, rather than outreach, teach and accept.</p>
<p>That is MY Yahadut; I can see what THEIRS is&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Kol HaKavod. Beautifully written. There were 2 main things that attracted me to Orthodox to begin with: 1) the ability to ask questions; and 2) the lack of stress on emunah. As a Jew who grew up in a Christian household, being told regularly to &#039;just have faith&#039; was a complete turn-off. Obviously, if it were that easy, I would have done it. Emunah, IMO, does not come from not asking questions, but from pushing the limits of what you know and what is acceptable. It is a shame that now that I&#039;ve been observant for 15+ years my questions are no longer tolerated by many in the community. Thank G-d these were not the people I first met when I was becoming baalah teshuvah!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good essay R. Fink. 

&quot;Instead, I think, the solution should be an expanded, more liberal interpretation of Torah M’Sinai and God.&quot; - I think that they rely on the more fanciful explanations to begin with in order to catch you.  Grade school rebbeim only teach the most elaborate magical explanation they can find; kids who love Harry Potter will also fall in love with Jacob&#039;s neck that turns to marble. 

&quot;That is the abundance of mysticism within our community.&quot; - Today, I don&#039;t think  you can question all the mystical attributes associated with Hassidic Rabbis without being thought of as a Heretic. A concept that was invented two centuries ago, that a  Hassidic Rabbi can look at you and know your sins, can affect the outcome of certain events out of his control, etc... is now dogma, even amongst non Hassidic Jews. You have Lithuanian style Jews tripping over themselves to look at some rebbes face and shake his hand, or to have the rebbe read their palms. (FYI, RYP of YFR has often spoken about the problem  of modern mysticism, as you may know.)

&quot;The article suggests that the Internet is to blame for orthopraxy.&quot; - What 80 years ago was blamed on books and pamphlets is now blamed on another form of writing, a computer screen. There isnt anything special about the internet, other than ease of access, which I suppose can make  it &quot;worse&quot; for these people, but the concept of people finding information isn&#039;t a new concept. It&#039;s an easy scapegoat; people have been doing what has been happening for millennia probably, sometimes by word of mouth, or books, but it&#039;s the internet&#039;s fault? Nobody questioned belief&#039;s or found new ideas before 1993?

In the end, I suspect that the only people the leaders care about are those who are found in Lakewood style communities. Those communities evolved out of the existing system so it isn&#039;t to be changed. What people in other areas do or think isn&#039;t of concern because &#039;they&#039;re already living false lives, etc..&#039; I&#039;m sure you know that mentality. 

The whole yeshiva system is based on that concept, sacrifice the thousands for the few. Allow thousands of young  men and women be wholly unprepared for their lives in order to get maybe three or four out of a class into Beis Medrash Gavoah.]]></description>
