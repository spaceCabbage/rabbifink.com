		<description><![CDATA[Dennis Prager is a well educated and an influenced speaker. I&#039;ve being learning English from radio personalities like him, Michael Jackson, a S. African ABC talk show man, Michael Medved and others.  Dennis also is a source of a history of Israel - since I came from  USSR where there was a limited chance to learn such things. What bothers me in Prager that is his political bias, which I found to be unappropriated for a thinker. I often find that his self-centered personality is a big turn away. He does not pay the same respect and attention to people of a different from his political views. I like my Rabbi view - &quot; When we live among like-minded people it is easy to forget that there are lots of folks who are different from us&quot;. That is what I&#039;ve been having in mind dealing with all kinds of people. Before I project on them my thoughts and beliefs I carefully learn about them, and never impose on anybody - including my kids - my belief, learning from my long life that the choice should be made in each person&#039;s head and heart. I don&#039;t judge Prager for him changing his political orientation, but he is  now extremely untorelent to the democrats. Thinkers should have respect for all people. I would finish with a thought of my Rabbi:
 &quot;I also believe it is important not to conflate political ideology and religious beliefs. There are plenty of left wing people who are religious and plenty of right wing people whose religious beliefs are flimsy or clearly erroneous. Politics and religion are meant to be two separate things. That’s the way the Torah system was in ancient Israel. The priests and the monarchs were from different families. And that’s the way it should be in America as well&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;That&#039;s what happens when you occasionally daven in black-hatter shuls and read Orthodox blogs (or at least the Orthodox commenters on DovBear.)&quot;

I should be fair here. My dissatisfaction is not entirely due to the antics of the Orthodox.  I get plenty frustrated at the mishugass I see in my own community.  It&#039;s enough to make a guy ditch it all, buy a couple hundred acres in some desolate out of the way area, and put up a fortified bunker and do the survivalist thing.

		<description><![CDATA[Prager is an intellectual lightweight.  I&#039;m surprised you waste your time giving him the time of day.

His main fallacy is conflating a belief in God with a belief in a particular religious system. His complaint seems to be about a lack of &quot;godliness&quot; (whatever that is) in people who go to the university.  This is, of course, the exact opposite of my life experience.  When I was attending college, I was quite religious, I even thought about becoming Orthodox.  I suspect this may have been a way to assert my Jewish identity in the face of being in a diverse college community where Jews were a smaller minority than they had been in my high school.  Now, after of 30 years of living in an Orthodox neighborhood, being very active in my Conservative shul, and seeing what my fellow Jews are up to, I&#039;m ready to ditch it all, get an apartment in Greenwich Village or San Fransisco, or Paris, or something and be mostly secular.  That&#039;s what happens when you occasionally daven in black-hatter shuls and read Orthodox blogs (or at least the Orthodox commenters on DovBear.)

  I can&#039;t be an atheist, because it&#039;s impossible to prove a negative.   That doesn&#039;t mean that I have to believe in the truth claims of Orthodox Judaism, though.  Of course, I can&#039;t prove that Orthodox Judaism is false, either, but I have enough evidence to suggest to me that the truth claims of its theology are very unlikely to be true.  Which means that unless I get some sort of other material or psychic benefit from participating in the Orthodox community, why should I bother?  (By the way, the same applies to Conservative and Reform Judaism as well.) I participate in a religious community because of the fellowship, the rituals provide me some grounding and peace of mind, and the ethical principals (most of which are shared with other religious faiths) provide a better life for all.  God plays no part in this, except at a theoretical level.  When God talks to me, I suppose I&#039;ll listen.  When a rabbi talks, I might listen, but skeptically.  And this is only right.  Surely rabbis, even gedolim and even chazal, don&#039;t presume to be God.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; E. Fink - &lt;i&gt;Judaism was willing to evolve with society.&lt;/i&gt;

More than that, much more than that. Judaism was at &lt;b&gt;the forefront&lt;/b&gt; of that evolution of society. It&#039;s no accident that so many of the liberal thinkers of this world are Jewish or draw upon ideas first created by Jews. Even today when a liberal society is already entrenched, Jews are still among the most vocal proponents of liberalism.

Shabbat Shalom all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi HH!

Interesting. I did not know that about him. However, I would guess that people like to define their own agenda, rather than be told they have one and what it is. It is conceivable for someone to be described as having a secularist agenda by someone else, while completely disagreeing and being truthful about it. I find that ideological opponents rarely agree about what the other is up to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even if this is your last post on this topic, I hope you return or at the very least continue correspondence via email or Facebook (if you are on there...).

There must be a misunderstanding because I mostly agree with the quoted text. What I refer to as moral truths of Islam or orthodox Judaism I simply mean the way they are practiced and have evolved to today. We can all agree with that. Also, I don&#039;t claim to have any unadulterated version of Judaism and that anyone must obey mine, I merely point out that my version is compatible with traditional Jewish sources. That is the position of orthodox Judaism.

When I say the prophets were prophets I mean that they claim to be prophets whereas today&#039;s theodists claims to be preachers or teachers because no one would believe they are prophets and because they serve a different function. Prophets brought the word of God to the people. Today&#039;s theodists interpret ACTS of God to give THEIR view of the message.

The Talmud says (in a couple place) that Prophecy died and God hides Himself from clear view. Ruach HaKodesh can&#039;t be prophecy. Rambam&#039;s view works for me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As regards suicide bombings: I&#039;ve attempted to argue otherwise, but I tend to think that the purpose of suicide bombings is more for the bombing, with the suicide part as in unwanted side effect. (Yes, the martyrdom aspect is glorified but nonetheless.) In any case, it&#039;s become a moot point given that suicide bombing has waned (presumably as attempts became less successful) to be replaced by improvised explosive devices and kassam rockets in Iraq and Israel respectively. (This may support the original point.)

You make pretty broad statements about &quot;moral truths of Islam&quot; and &quot;Orthodox Judaism&quot; in your response, so I&#039;m going to copy-and-paste something I wrote elsewhere, which addresses what I perceive as the fallacy of such statements:

&quot;Every once in a while an Orthodox Jew will appear on Wikipedia and attempt to rewrite history to favor only his view point. Everything from the Sadducees to Reform Judaism will be characterized as the bastard sons of a “true Judaism” that is constant from Moses to Auerbach. It doesn’t take much thought to recognize the fallacy in his argument. The Judaism of Bnei Brak bears no resemblance to the worship of the Second Temple in Judea. The editor may argue that the changes and innovations introduced by his predecessors were somehow more legitimate than those of Anon ben David and Solomon Schechter, by why should this concern anyone who doesn’t share that perspective? Surely Moses, Jesus and Mohammed would recognize none of the religious group that exist today, and why should they? Today’s religions are simply not theirs. 

	Judaism, Christianity and Islam have changed immeasurably in the millennia over which each has evolved. Judaism saw the emergence of a Mishna, a Gemara, a Mishna Torah, a Shulhan Aruch, legal manual piled upon legal manual, a neo-platonic theology and Kabbalistic mysticism, Hasidism, the Reform Movement, the United Synagogue, change after change. Christianity saw a Council of Nicaea, a split between Eastern and Roman Orthodoxies, an Anglican church, a Reformation, a thousand splits into a thousand movements each viewing itself as the true Christianity. Islam saw the Hadiths, the Sunni-Shia split, and generations of Fiqh. Even the religion of Joseph Smith Jr. quickly became the religion of Brigham Young which became a movement of Latter Day Saints that Smith could never recognize. And so the words of Akiva, Ali, Pious and Young should have no meaning to us today. These men have no voice except the voice transmitted by men who call themselves their successors. Should it matter to me if Pious said smash and Ali said Hug if the “sons of Pious” say hug and the “disciples of Ali” say kill? I will not convince a Ger Hasid that his Rebbe misunderstood Akiva, and so it is his Rebbe’s religion that should concern me. And I may hope that the Rebbe is a peaceful man so I might call Ger Hasidism a “religion of peace.”

In the end it shouldn’t matter to the outsider if the Bible or Koran says “Thou shalt surely eradicate the memory of Amalek from beneath the heavens” as long the later, authoritative sources declared that “You shall NOT kill Amalek. Forget about it.” We should recognize the sources that really govern people’s actions, often personified in Imams and Rabbis and their close groups of colleagues and teachers. We gain nothing from generalizations about “Islam,” and recognizing the plethora of worldviews that fuel countless individuals will surely serve us well.&quot;
(/quote)

Notwithstanding the obvious point that Khamenei unthinkingly modifies his religion because he&#039;s xenophobic, and Fink because he&#039;s a moralist, a true disciple of any religious leader will tend to believe that he follows the true word of God. And by they will have to recognize that a tradition that they view as their predecessor held that killing Amalekites is a virtue, not a sin. And hence, they must posit that their religious morality is not beholden to the standard Western view of morality. And then if they happen to be the true disciples of Kahane, they must be stopped, but a liberal Christian saying &quot;the Word of the Bible is Love&quot; just isn&#039;t going to do it. And why should it? 


&quot;The prophets of any given religion were prophets.&quot; That&#039;s a pretty broad statement (I&#039;d like to go to your synagogue). However, I can&#039;t adduce much support for it, or the idea that God disappeared on any given given date. Certainly, Jewish traditions seem to recognize the hand of God in events well after the disappearance of prophecy (or even Ruach Ha-Kodesh, which is slang for prophecy). 

(Probably my last post, I really didn&#039;t mean to spend the day commenting on blogs.)]]></description>

Judaism saw the emergence of a Mishna, a Gemara, a Mishna Torah, a Shulhan Aruch, legal manual piled upon legal manual, a neo-platonic theology and Kabbalistic mysticism, Hasidism, the Reform Movement, the United Synagogue, change after change. Christianity saw a Council of Nicaea, a split between Eastern and Roman Orthodoxies, an Anglican church, a Reformation, a thousand splits into a thousand movements each viewing itself as the true Christianity. Islam saw the Hadiths, the Sunni-Shia split, and generations of Fiqh. Even the religion of Joseph Smith Jr. quickly became the religion of Brigham Young which became a movement of Latter Day Saints that Smith could never recognize. And so the words of Akiva, Ali, Pious and Young should have no meaning to us today. These men have no voice except the voice transmitted by men who call themselves their successors. Should it matter to me if Pious said smash and Ali said Hug if the “sons of Pious” say hug and the “disciples of Ali” say kill? I will not convince a Ger Hasid that his Rebbe misunderstood Akiva, and so it is his Rebbe’s religion that should concern me. And I may hope that the Rebbe is a peaceful man so I might call Ger Hasidism a “religion of peace.”</p>
<p>In the end it shouldn’t matter to the outsider if the Bible or Koran says “Thou shalt surely eradicate the memory of Amalek from beneath the heavens” as long the later, authoritative sources declared that “You shall NOT kill Amalek. Forget about it.” We should recognize the sources that really govern people’s actions, often personified in Imams and Rabbis and their close groups of colleagues and teachers. We gain nothing from generalizations about “Islam,” and recognizing the plethora of worldviews that fuel countless individuals will surely serve us well.&#8221;<br />

<p>Notwithstanding the obvious point that Khamenei unthinkingly modifies his religion because he&#8217;s xenophobic, and Fink because he&#8217;s a moralist, a true disciple of any religious leader will tend to believe that he follows the true word of God. And by they will have to recognize that a tradition that they view as their predecessor held that killing Amalekites is a virtue, not a sin. And hence, they must posit that their religious morality is not beholden to the standard Western view of morality. And then if they happen to be the true disciples of Kahane, they must be stopped, but a liberal Christian saying &#8220;the Word of the Bible is Love&#8221; just isn&#8217;t going to do it. And why should it? </p>
<p>&#8220;The prophets of any given religion were prophets.&#8221; That&#8217;s a pretty broad statement (I&#8217;d like to go to your synagogue). However, I can&#8217;t adduce much support for it, or the idea that God disappeared on any given given date. Certainly, Jewish traditions seem to recognize the hand of God in events well after the disappearance of prophecy (or even Ruach Ha-Kodesh, which is slang for prophecy). </p>

		<description><![CDATA[As regards suicide bombings: I&#039;ve attempted to argue otherwise, but I tend to think that the purpose of suicide bombings is more for the bombing, with the suicide part as in unwanted side effect. (Yes, the martyrdom aspect is glorified but nonetheless.) In any case, it&#039;s become a moot point given that suicide bombing has waned (presumably as attempts became less successful) to be replaced by improvised explosive devices and kassam rockets in Iraq and Israel respectively. (This may support the original point.)

You make pretty broad statements about &quot;moral truths of Islam&quot; and &quot;Orthodox Judaism&quot; in your response, so I&#039;m going to copy-and-paste something I wrote elsewhere, which addresses what I perceive as the fallacy of such statements:

&quot;Every once in a while an Orthodox Jew will appear on Wikipedia and attempt to rewrite history to favor only his view point. Everything from the Sadducees to Reform Judaism will be characterized as the bastard sons of a “true Judaism” that is constant from Moses to Auerbach. It doesn’t take much thought to recognize the fallacy in his argument. The Judaism of Bnei Brak bears no resemblance to the worship of the Second Temple in Judea. The editor may argue that the changes and innovations introduced by his predecessors were somehow more legitimate than those of Anon ben David and Solomon Schechter, by why should this concern anyone who doesn’t share that perspective? Surely Moses, Jesus and Mohammed would recognize none of the religious group that exist today, and why should they? Today’s religions are simply not theirs.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for reading and writing such thoughtful commentary.

Regarding Islam and fundamentalism as compared with Orthodox Judaism:

Cowardice - I think it is cowardly to make a point (kill people) and not live to face the music. So I was referring to suicide bombers, the MO of fundamentalist Islam in the 21 Century.

Islam in general - I think that Islam is divided. I think many use their religion for a (to borrow your term) non-self-contained purpose. Politics. Power. Hatred. Those are not the self-contained moral truths of Islam. So I am hesitant to completely write off Islam as a religion that by default produces crazy people who kill for religion.

Jewish religious killings - The fact that we have not practiced those laws for two millenia is not a factor to be ignored. Judaism was willing to evolve with society. And thus we find ourselves at a place that OJ does not endores killing for religion&#039;s sake.

Regarding Theodicy:

The prophets of any given religion were prophets. Today there are no prophets, just people who fancy themselves prophets or people who act as if they are. Man can know the will of God. It was communicated to Man. But at no point do we see God explaining to Man the way He works. Attempting to ascribe our ideas of why God ACTS is the point I take issue with.

Again, thank you for your comments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A very well-reasoned and well-articulated article. I&#039;d like to address two arguments that do not relate directly to the articles main thesis, but are very interesting nonetheless.

Quote: &#039;I am not sure if the tepid response is to blame as much as the acts of cowardice and violence made in the name of God by radical Muslims. When people see the level of atrocity capable in the name of God, I believe, it is a turn off. Though I don’t know how much we need to have an “untepid” response as much as we need to reinforce the idea of our versions of God do not allow for such militant violence.&#039;

Aside from the obvious note that &quot;cowardice&quot; (OED: &quot;want of courage to face danger&quot;) is not particularly apropos, I think this statement ignores an important point. Many religious systems, and very arguably* &quot;Orthodox Judaism&quot; among them, claim to be morally self-contained. I think this makes intuitive sense. I have difficulty enough arguing for the existence of any single moral system (the is-ought problem) that I&#039;d be hesitant to multiply my problems by claiming that there is a God driven morality in addition to an independent kind. In this light, the actions of fundamentalists appear consistent and correct, within their moral system. (Read &quot;within their equally justified moral system,&quot; assuming that basic morality must always be an axiom within its own system.) I see no difficulty with recognizing that they are acting in accordance with their beliefs while insisting that they all be locked up, for the good of society.

Should Orthodoxy &quot;reinforce the idea of our versions of God do not allow for such militant violence?&quot; Certainly the religion upon which it is based did allow for such violence, in the cases of religious wars and the slaughter of Amalek, or Ir Hanidachat and the many religious violations punished by death. Perhaps, given the extent to which Orthodox Judaism clings to its old traditions, it should emphasize that it represents an &quot;authentic self-contained system&quot;, in contrast to other &quot;watered-down&quot; religions and denominations. Naturally this would be a &quot;turn off&quot; to a good humanist, but perhaps Orthodox Judaism shouldn&#039;t be tailoring its message to humanists.

This brings me to my next objection:
Quote: &quot;Theodicy has been a blunt tool for polemicists for ages and I think most people are uncomfortable with the idea that a man can know what God “intends” when disaster strikes. Pastors and rabbis are guilty of this and Prager is wrong when he says that the right wing elements of religions are better equipped to dealing with disaster than the more liberal sides. I don’t think either side is better equipped than the other. There are morons on both sides. Strident admonishments from televangelists about the wrath of God striking Haiti or Japan can’t be the solution that Prager is suggesting “works”. So I don’t quite know where he is going with this point.&quot;

Every monotheistic religion is predicated upon a simple claim: Man *can* know the will of God. Without that claim, no one would claim to &quot;practice&quot; a religion, he would claim to know that God exists, a piece of information no more relevant to his life than the Czech word for watermelon. Moses, Jesus, Mohammed and Joseph Smith Jr. all claimed to know God&#039;s will very well, and to see it not merely in his words but in his actions. This pushes many of their followers to make one very dubious claim, that God can violate the perceived rules of nature. But once they&#039;ve made that claim, is it worthwhile to throw it out to avoid seeming like the televangelists? Consider that now they have to jump through another hoop, and claim that God has gone from being administrator of the universe (clearly reflecting almost all early religious beliefs) to merely its creator. They must reject all prayer for God help, or create convoluted explanations for how they serve a different goal than their contents imply. 

Even once they&#039;ve jumped through these hoops, religious revisionists still face a problem. They still need to learn the will of God to remain religious rather than simply Deists. Are they better off learning God&#039;s will from a tsunami thousands of years ago or from a typo? The concept of an immanent God gives relevance to people&#039;s lives and transforms religion from people talking towards a wall to real, personal interactions, with perceptible effect upon human lives. Humility may prompt a shift towards a less personal God, but I&#039;m not convinced that it makes religion more appealing or, (presumably more importantly for the average religious person) that it solves any of the conundrums that religion must deal with in the first place.

(Note: This should in no way imply that picketing funerals, blaming someone for their loss, or any of the other garbage people engage in, is acceptable. Some measure of common sense, combined with recognition of the fairly universal rule in all moral systems that you don&#039;t cause people unnecessary anguish (&quot;al tehiye scumbag&quot;), should be enough to prevent these kinds of actions. Providence doesn&#039;t have to imply being a jerk.)

*There is quite a bit in Jewish tradition to argue to sides of this point, I&#039;ve merely skimmed the surface. I merely wanted to respond to the latent assumption in the paragraph, that all forms of Islam must adhere to some established morality, and that Orthodox Judaism obviously does so.]]></description>
