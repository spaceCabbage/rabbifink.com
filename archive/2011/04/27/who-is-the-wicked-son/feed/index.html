		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve seen the wicked son portrayed simply as a teen-aged boy (forgot which haggadah).  Wise son was an adult, simple son a school-aged child, and son who did not know how to ask, an infant. Does that qualify?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Think about it. He is &quot;wise&quot; not righteous. Being smart or wise is nice but it&#039;s not perfection.

Another point: we give each son the answer that helps them best. We give the wise son an answer that reflects the irrationality of a specific law. It&#039;s to teach him a lesson. Not everything has a reason. Sometimes we just do. (Sometimes...) ;) Needed a reason to do everything is a flaw too.]]></description>
