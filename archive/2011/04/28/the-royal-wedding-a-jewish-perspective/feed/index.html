		<description><![CDATA[My father was a close advisor of the last Latvian President and I was learning in the Netiv Aryeh (old city) when she came to the kotel. I came down to meet the president and it felt nice being recieved so warmly. As I turned around I saw the entire yeshiva watching from the porch and I saw my rebbe, Rav Hizkiahu Nebenzahl (chief rabbi of the Old City) standing and watching. It was very uncommon to see him just standing there not doing anything watching &quot;the scene&quot; in the kotel plaza so I asked him why he was standing there and he answered half jokingly half serious whats written above about going out to see kings.]]></description>
