		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;The doctrines of the religions tell you what it is and how to fix it.&lt;/i&gt;

I don&#039;t think so. Nowhere are there clear directions written down how to diagnose the problem and how to treat it. It seems to be something completely arbitrary and left up to the &quot;power brokers&quot; (or holy men as some like to call them). In the middle ages, for example, Christianity used it to keep people in line, all they had to do was accuse someone of being a witch or being possessed, and they could almost summarily execute them. Today not so much, but there is still the threat of shunning, etc.

Shabbat Shalom and Chodesh Tov to all.]]></description>

How exactly do you tell the difference?
