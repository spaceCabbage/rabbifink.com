		<description><![CDATA[It doesn&#039;t matter the source - halacha is one package.  Now that the shomrei mitzvot of the Diaspora have accepted two-day yom tov, that is the obligation.  

Once you start picking and choosing which universally held halachot to keep and which to disregard, you are no longer serving Hashem.  

It&#039;s not that every single rabbinic enactment was given at Mount Sinai, but the process by which the enactments were made was given at sinai, along with the written and oral law.

It&#039;s a bit Skinnerian, but the rabbanim who enacted second day yom tov used a logical process to arrive at that conclusion.  That process was given to them by their teachers, who received it from their teachers, etc etc.  who received it from Moses who received it from Hashem.

Halacha is one package.  Accept its validity or don&#039;t, but to cherry pick from it when it suits you is an invalid approach.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Choosetoswim - &lt;i&gt; That would mean anything new we come up with was given to Moshe.&lt;/i&gt;

Anything? Do you really mean &lt;b&gt;anything&lt;/b&gt;?

So, for example, the Rebbe being Mashiach despite being niftar years ago was given to us by Moshe?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it was passed down through the generations.  What I am saying is that what we consider to be part of the Torah was taught to Moshe.  I saw from the Gaon a explanation of the words &quot;v&#039;sen chelkeinu b&#039;torsecha&quot; that we are asking for our specific lot in the torah that was given to Moshe.  That would mean anything new we come up with was given to Moshe.  My issue was with second day is from &quot;humans&quot;.  The connotation is that it is some sort of lesser not necessary to abide by law.

		<description><![CDATA[It is intentional and it is not childish.

Please find me a source that claims that mitzvos m&#039;drabanan were given to Moshe at Sinai. 
What you are proposing borders on the absurd. For 1500 years the greatest rabbis of the generation knew Purim would be enacted one day and they were just waiting for it to happen?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@efink:disqus I hope you are not doing this intentionally because it is quite childish. 

No, they did not.  It was enacted later.  Again, what was taught to Moshe was all of the oral torah.  Are mitzvos d&#039;raban excluded from torah shel bal peh?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you misunderstood.  All of the torah was given to Moshe including all of the oral torah and all the rabbis enacted and taught.  It&#039;s one of the 13 principles of faith of the rambam.  This is fundamental if we are to believe in any of the oral torah.  If you dont believe in this then you can write off anything that is not black and white written in the written torah.  Thus, whatever human made you want to call it it is not actually human made.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Based on LO ADU ROSH, Tishrei 1 can not be on Sunday, Wednesday or Friday. Thus, the only possible safek is between Monday and Tuesday. Thus, if Elul 30 is on Shabbos, that day must be Rosh Hashanah. If it is on Sunday, then Monday must be Rosh Hashanah. 
The Gemara on Sukkos 54b, says that according to the Rabbanan, the first day of Sukkos (and therefore Rosh Hashanah) could not be a Friday. Thus this rule applied at the time of the Mikdash. 
Rosh Hashanah 20a explained the reason as due to either burial or vegetables which also meant Yom Kippur couldn&#039;t be on Friday.  Thus, RH also couldn&#039;t be on Wednesday. 
When Sunday was excluded is not as clear (however, it could not have been after the calendar was fixed). There is some mention of this in Sukkah. 
Finally, Elul was rarely full.

To summarize, by the time the calendar was fixed, there rarely was a safek (except for Mon/Tuesday). Were the people outside of Eretz Yisroel, holding one or two days?

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;With all due respect, Rabbi, does not the speed of communication in this day and age render the second day of observance unnecessary? Even if we were to rely upon witnesses once again and not upon the scientifically set calendar, we would be able to obtain the information from the court within a matter of minutes (or hours if they were especially lazy) or, at the most, if the new moon occurred on Shabbos, a day later. Since the second day has never been observed in Israel, I find it difficult to understand why there is merit to observing a second day in the Diaspora with the advent of this technology. &lt;/i&gt;

A fair point. My contention is that even WITH that technology, the rabbis of the Talmud were wise to enact a practice that would guarantee that we would have the lessons of the new moon for posterity. It is an important lesson that they managed to keep in our observance.

&lt;i&gt;The only consistent alternative, at least as I see it, would be to suggest that all observers, regardless of their locale, observe for two days. In doing so, the entire Jewish population would have these powerful metaphorical reminders that you suggest. Put otherwise: why should only the Jews of the Diaspora be reminded of these important lessons? How will Jews in Israel get the same reminders? If those reminders are good enough for the Jews of Israel, why aren&#039;t they good enough for the Jews of the Diaspora?&lt;/i&gt;

This was asked above. See #2 in the comment before yours.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why don&#039;t feel like skipping the first day of yom tov?

If you accept that Hashem runs the universe, determines your income, and that the only viable method of changing Hashem&#039;s decree is Repentance, Prayer, and Charity - then you aren&#039;t losing anything by taking off Yom Tov 2.

If you don&#039;t accept it, then stop wasting your time with sabbaths and holidays, you&#039;re living a lie.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree with Mark. I don&#039;t see the second day per say as a reminder of what you say here:

&quot;By keeping the 2nd day we remind ourselves of the important lessons of the moon and the important lessons of human beings establishing the new month. &quot;

Whatever lesson you were referring here, I don&#039;t see what the second day gives that the first day did not. Rabbi Hirsh&#039;s explanation is a real nice one, but I don&#039;t see it determinative on a second day, let alone a temple existing.

On a personal basis, I see the positive and negative of a second day. We are in galut. A second day is an ever present reminder for us never to feel too comfortable. Galut SHOULD feel uncomfortable. In our time, where Jews have so much freedom, it is easy to forget that we are in galut. I believe this serves as a reminder. [IIRC, I think the Rav said this]

On the other hand, I work for a company that pays me by the hour. I don&#039;t show up, I don&#039;t get paid. This holiday season is financially difficult for us. When I check the account, I sometimes feel like skipping out on the second day and getting to work so I don&#039;t get further into debt.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Sorry, but I don&#039;t buy it. It is the 1st day that reminds us of the lesson and is the day that was &quot;chosen&quot; by humans based upon seeing the new moon. The 2nd day is simply the day that happens to follow the 1st day and nothing at all of its own reminds us of anything.&lt;/i&gt;

I think you misunderstood. The first day only works in the times of the Temple when they actually used the witnesses to establish the dates. But now we don&#039;t so without the 2nd day to remind us of the issue it would be forgotten.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;By keeping the 2nd day we remind ourselves of the important lessons of the moon and the important lessons of human beings establishing the new month.&lt;/i&gt;

Sorry, but I don&#039;t buy it. It is the &lt;b&gt;1st day&lt;/b&gt; that reminds us of the lesson and is the day that was &quot;chosen&quot; by humans based upon seeing the new moon. The 2nd day is simply the day that happens to follow the 1st day and nothing at all of its own reminds us of anything.

&lt;i&gt;But the outlying territories would not hear about the precise date of the new month for up to 2 weeks.&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;ve never truly understood this part (I know eidim, sanhedrin, etc) ... why didn&#039;t they simply look up and see the moon from where they were?]]></description>
