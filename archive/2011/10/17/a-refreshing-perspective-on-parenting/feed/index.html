		<description><![CDATA[Excellent point.  Often Jewish parents have difficulty expressing unconditional love or sometimes even feeling it.  This has a lot to do with the way they experience religion and their relationship with G-d and with themselves.  G-d&#039;s love is often experienced as conditional.   For some reason, probably due to the trauma of two thousand years of exile, people focus on Yom Kippur, for example, on all the need to repent from sin so as not to be punished.  The basic point of the day, that we are being cleansed and forgiven and making up with G-d and with our fellow Jews is overlooked.  It is meant to be a day full of love and joy, not only of love and awe.  And G-d&#039;s parenting, while it pushes us sometimes as much as a tiger mom to be the best, is deep down pure unadulterated love and joy.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The article was very touching.  When I read it, I could not help but think of the Jewish children, now young adults, who are rejected (to one degree or another) by their parents simply for loving someone of the &quot;wrong&quot; religion or for being born with the &quot;wrong&quot; sexuality. ]]></description>

Depersonalizing the issue for a moment, there is a Tiger Mom mentality out there, whether it is exactly Chua&#039;s methodology or not, it still needs a balance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had a similar impression of Chua&#039;s parenting from the articles and reviews, but then I read her book and I loved it. Her parenting style changed over the course of the book as she reacted to events in her life, like death and illness in her family. By the end of the book, her parenting might still be considered strict by some standards, but she loosened up in many ways and put more emphasis on love and relationships. ]]></description>
