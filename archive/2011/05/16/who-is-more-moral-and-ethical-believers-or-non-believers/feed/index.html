		<description><![CDATA[ I agree with part of what you say.

I don&#039;t think it is a metaphysical, inner daat or anything like that. It is much more simple. The world has been &quot;tainted&quot; (in a good way) by believers. The morality has been set on some Divine standard. Any subsequent moral standard is based on Divine Law. Even if it deviates, it still begins with the Divine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used off-the-derech (NOT Orthoprax) as a specific example above, but the point is valid with regard to all atheists who behave in a &quot;moral&quot; or &quot;ethical&quot; way.

It is illogical to denounce the Bible as fiction, and continue to follow many biblical principles.  The conclusion that I have reached is that these atheists really do have a connection with G-d, even if they choose not to admit it to themselves.

Anytime I hear an atheist excuse his moral behavior with &quot;it&#039;s just the right thing to do&quot;, I know that he has just experienced shecheenah.  He might be so inundated with atheistic messages that he can&#039;t verbalize that inner knowing (daat) as a connection to Hashem - but that&#039;s what it is.
You claim that &lt;i&gt; &quot;...there is no difference between the ethical behavior of atheists and believers&quot;&lt;/i&gt;  I&#039;m explaining why that is so.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;The rhetoric often claims that non-believers prefer not to believe to give them license to act immorally.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

I would phrase this differently.

Those who claim not to believe in G-d, and yet continue to act according to Biblical morality most of the time
(even when not bound to do so by secular law), are lying to themselves.  

They obviously recognize that there is a Creator.  

They simply fool themselves into thinking otherwise, so as to justify a few practices that are either
socially convenient or for which they have an overwhelming physical desire.

If there is no (seemingly) insurmountable obstacle, such as social pressure or great physical desire, 
the &quot;moral atheist&quot; will follow G-d&#039;s laws, even when there is gain to be had from violation.

In the specific case of religiously educated Jews, this is why a Jewish &quot;atheist&quot; will often 
refrain from improper (but legal) business practices.    He will likely do large favors for others, and give good amounts of charity (even though it causes him a loss of time and resources).

 In fact, this &quot;atheist&quot; will fulfill EVEN MORE of the commandments that he doesn&#039;t have a strong societal or physical desire  to break! 

 All of this is illogical.  If there is no G-d, then just follow secular law.  &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; are definitions given to actions by the  Torah.    If the Torah is work of fiction, then the labels of &quot;good&quot; on charity and &quot;evil&quot; on taking revenge are fictional as well.

Since we find that the vast majority of self-avowed Jewish atheists continue to follow many mitzvot, we must conclude that they secretly still  know and understand that &quot;Hashem Hu Elo-heem&quot;.
