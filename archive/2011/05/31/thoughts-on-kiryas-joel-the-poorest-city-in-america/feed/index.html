		<description><![CDATA[Typical cult. They cannot see a world beyond their extreme limitations. Rape of women is very much seen in same way as Arabs. The woman is always the slut and I am referring specifically to the Nechemya Weberman’s  rape case. 
Weberman, an unlicensed counselor in the Satmar hasidic community, was convicted of repeatedly and regularly sexually abusing the girl beginning when she was 12-years-old and continuing until she was 16. He is serving a 50-year sentence in state prison. Satmar community rallied around him, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for his defense and labeling his victim a “whore,” a “prostitute” and a “slut.” Now Weberman can be someone&#039;s slut in jail.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[growing up in KJ all my life all i can say is... you got it right, but wrong in a way, 
its mostly the same in all chasiduss should it be williamsburg or in any big chasidus in borough park, same goes for monsey, and in Israel,
this all issue to see from the outside is difficult and completely out of touch,cus you have to live it to understand what is going trough there minds,
KJ may be more controlled in a way as you mentioned as its isolated and stands out, and it all goes to SATMER.
the rea;; issue is the system itself and goes back to post WW2 education and extreme leadership, the people running the show dont even know what wrong they do or why innocent victims suffer   from their rules and enforced regulations??? you should be like everyone else.. no? why cant you??
but time will change as generations change i have lived trough lots of changes in the past 25-30 years.

in any way thanks for the article! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt; it’s neither fascist nor communist, and certainly can’t be both&lt;/i&gt;

That&#039;s the best part. It is both. Communist because they &quot;tax&quot; the more wealthy and give it to the poor keeping everyone on equal ground financially. Fascist because whatever the leadership says becomes the truth. See? It is both!

Your last two points are great. Thanks for your thoughts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; This kind of leadership is fascist. This is not democracy. It is a dictatorship. It is a communist regime.
 
Sorry to be pedantic, but it’s neither fascist nor communist, and certainly can’t be both. What it is is totalitarian. (Communism is a leftist economic theory, while fascism is a right-wing political ideology that Mussolini famously described as being, “whatever I say it is.”)
 
&#062; Requiring them to live by an arbitrary set of rules and regulations and cutting them off if they don’t is a travesty.
 
I agree, but the Chassidic leadership didn’t come up with it themselves. Putting someone in cherem for not following community standards has a long and hallowed tradition.
 
&#062; The sad irony is that chassidus was created to give everyone an opportunity to connect with the spiritual and religious.
 
Another irony is that Chassidus was the first modern reform movement. It recast Judaism as being about a mystical mission and connection to God. Yet Chassidus today is on the right wing of Orthodoxy, a sect that formed in opposition of the Reform movement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whether or not democracy is the most fair form of government, majoritarian decision-making is the proper halachic form of government.  The Rishonim wrote numerous Shailos and Teshuvos on this issue, and while they differed in detail and their understandings of what institutions majoritarian government implies, they almost universally held that majoritarian control of communal laws (takkanos and gezeiros), and of local leadership is a must.   

I will, God-willing, complete a law review article on the subject in the near future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;This kind of leadership is fascist. This is not democracy. It is a 
dictatorship. It is a communist regime. It is a stark reminder that 
absolute power, absolutely corrupts.

Oppressing people so that they will be obedient is downright evil. 
Requiring them to live by an arbitrary set of rules and regulations and 
cutting them off if they don’t is a travesty.&quot;

Fascist? Dictatorship? Communist regime? Really? Are we getting carried away here with gross and dramatic epithets that have no bearing on the issues? What does &#039;democracy&#039; have anything to do with a religious community and religious authority? (And why do people in America always invoke that word as the purist model for everything decent and fair?)

Rest assured, if people did not have their reasons for following that particular way of life, they wouldn&#039;t. We are not talking about nefarious cult leaders that enforce their mal-intent on mindless sheep. Please be reasonable. If you&#039;d like to level a critique against a way of life where people seem to be suffering unnecessarily, please stay on point.
Also, it is possible to leave. The human spirit is always capable of rising to freedom and self-actualization, and I suspect the &#039;victims&#039; here are quite complicit. It sounds to me like you have made some sort of vague comparison between what goes on in an oppressive  Muslim fundamentalist society and a community of needy  people that have made themselves  totally dependent because of their backwards priorities. Have you spoken to anyone from KJ or visited  there before you wrote your piece? ]]></description>
