		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Mission accomplished&quot; ?!?

That&#039;s an odd turn of phrase, made famous by GW Bush. It was an expression of his enthusiasm for launching an unprovoked war of aggression that has left far more innocent people dead than Osama Bin Laden could ever dream of, not to mention tearing an entire country to pieces and spreading incalculable human misery. 

If Bin Laden deserves to be shot in the head and dumped in the ocean without trial, please tell me what a monster like Bush deserves, in your estimation. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The angry tone is incidental, and to quote someone great &quot;tone shmone&quot;. It is how I have read through his responses to comments, he never replies to the substance of the comment, he merely tries to discredit the poster.  It is all a game to him, an intellectually dishonest game at that. I am merely pointing that out.  Sorry if that makes you think I am angry.  It is the worst when someone posts a blog and can&#039;t take the criticism and just discredits anyone who tries.  It&#039;s an epidemic amongst blogger I might add.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really!? 
&quot;But I don’t think it is a reason to rejoice. If someone must die for their actions it cannot be with glee that we carry out that task. “Binfol oyvecha al tismach. Do not rejoice at the fall of your enemy.”&quot; 
You used the passuk as your words, it can&#039;t get much clearer.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He did not write anything similar to you.  He brought an entire array of sources and explanations and tried to explain HOW we should respond, not responding and then finding the source to justify it.  In the end he said we should rejoice.  Do not take this as if I am in agreement, but I did not rejoice, only because it logically made no sense to me.  It will not undo the harm done.  I personally know a child of a victim of 9-11 and she did not start celebrating his death. I am guessing because it won&#039;t bring her parent back. I do question myself if I should be joyous.  R&#039; Hoffman&#039;s article articulates my conflicting thoughts on this.  

He does not anywhere in the article come out and say do not be joyous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Firstly, i would like to apologize for undervaluing your greatness.  I am sure you ARE an excellent attorney, but we need not discuss that you took the time to let everyone know.  Sorry for not taking the time to research every aspect of  your life.

Secondly, I will repeat your logic back to you and you explain where I missed the boat. &quot;you are unfit to interpret agadeta and midrash. as such, none of your points are valid&quot;.  You, without knowing anything about me have deemed me unfit.  How can you be so sure? Because I don&#039;t choose to follow how the ben yehoyada or margoliot hayam choose to explain something?  I am not saying my word is truth,  but the post came across as stating that the passuk perfectly describes the situation.  He would have done justice top at least take the time and explain how although a basic definition given is such he has an alternate reading with some real basis.  Our feelings are not supposed to guide how we interpret the Torah, the Torah is our guide.  I have no issue with his disagreement, but at no point did he validly address my comments.  every response was to some nuanced little point that was at most a distant aside form the actual comment. As are yours.  I do not need to follow the margoliot hayam, you said so yourself, that is the basis for your argument.  Every is entitled to their own opinion.  Have an opinion, that is fine.  Just back it up and respond intelligently to a comment.  Don&#039;t respond with an attack.

As for my original posting that started with the name calling.  I just wanted to get an interesting response.  A friend forwarded this post to me and fed me a little background about  his responses. But that is neither here nor there.  It really was just a bet to see how long till I get banned.  I am already a little troll in Finks eyes, I guess when I reach ogre status he&#039;ll ban me.  I must be valid to some degree if he needs to tweet to the world that someone has a response to someone who opposed his position on something. 

I never meant he was your mentor I took the same guess you did about mine, although I knew I was wrong I did it for the entertainment of your response.  It worked.

Lastly, although my username is filled standoffnish I chose it to iterate the irony of the blog&#039;s name.  If you need me to explain that to you I can.  Feel free to respond. Btw, I don&#039;t have contact information because I just created the account and haven&#039;t taken the time to edit my profile.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ok just a few corrections:

1. not i &quot;would make an outstanding attorney&quot; rather, &quot;AM an outstanding attorney&quot;. 

2. My logic isnt difficult to understand, but i guess ill try and use smaller words.  You claim that Fink (and sorry i dont use your title, i just figure that gadol mraban shemo at this point) misuses a pasuk. You back that up by admittedly citing an agadeta.  Therefore, you feel that can be only one explanation and application of said pasuk based solely on that appearance in the agadeta.  I responded that you should really educate yourself more on how and when both agadeta and midrash are to be used and employed.  A good start would be to learn the margoliot hayam and ben yehoyada.  (unless you have reviewed them adequately in the intervening time period, i dont see a reason we should be having a discussion.)

3. Fink is not my mentor. in fact we have never met.  i have casually read his blog posts and have discussed halachik issues and hashkafic issue with him on various online formats.  (we have also exchange some legal opinions and articles but thats neither here nor there.)  calling him my mentor only more fully illustrates your abilities.  I can very much accept another&#039;s viewpoint.  YOU sir, cannot.  you have decided that the agadeta you have cited is the be all and END all and MUST reject and call out Fink for his alleged misuse thereof.  it is YOU sir, who must look in the mirror and point the accusatory finger at YOURSELF for this point. in fact you attempt, poorly i might add, to accuse me of intolerance and then go ahead and claim you have no problem with fink&#039;s post, only to point out you have a problem with it.  you are a ball of contradictions my friend.  (See also Meshech Chochma Shemot 12, 15 generally)

4.  like i said, review the two sources i cited above (at the very least, there are many more you should review afterwards) and then get back to me on application of pesukim.

5. I dont need to give you approbation and you surely dont need me to give it to you.  your sarcasm is SO over the top that it doesnt even read well.  you should try less hard, its unbecoming.

6.  feel free to contact me off this blog if you want to address me further.  unlike you, i have left my contact info in my login, i can be reached on twitter @daniopp.  the fact that your login smacks of such standoffishness destroys your credibility from the word jump.  i hate to guess but ill do it anyway, you remind me of a shepherd without any sheep. a rabbi with no pulpit. in other words, a man who fancies himself something but really isnt.  after all, a shepherd without sheep is just a lonely man lost in the field left talking to himself, trying to convince others that he isnt.  its sad to watch.

now i may be wrong on the last part. and i can accept that. but i have a feeling im not that far off...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent reply.  You have deemed me unfit therefore I am discredited and  anything I say is invalid.  Excellent logic.  You would be an outstanding attorney, just like Fink.  You don&#039;t need to answer a real question just claim the person behind it is wrong and all falls by the wayside.  Proof is unnecessary, Daniopp has made a statement, it is the penultimate truth.  Sorry, your logic defies me. 

Just because I do not foolow the same line of reasoning as yours does not mean I am wrong.  As with your mentor (Fink, you are rabid defender of his, and also allowed to resort to name calling in his defense) you cannot accept another&#039;s view point.  I had no problem with his post, I had a problem with his misuse of a passuk, one the gemorrah, that just so happens to be in the middle of agadah, tells us does not apply to rishoim.  There is a distinction between agadah and what passsukim apply to.  It is not a definition of a passuk, its an application.  But I am wrong on this too, you have declared so.  Please let me know when I am allowed to have an opinion, I really want your approbation. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[you are unfit to interpret agadeta and midrash.  as such, none of your points are valid.  also &quot;defending his mentor&quot;, as you claim you are doing and want Fink to admit that he doesnt follow his mentor, etc. (blah blah blah), unless his mentor has asked you to do so, you are violating the honor of your shared (thats just a guess) mentor.  (See Kabed et avicha, etc.).

dont profess to be the knight in shining armor when it appears you are nothing more than a burlap-sacked mud-slinger...

like i said before, first review some margoliot hayam and ben yehoyada and then you can go on to criticize others usage and explanation of pesukim.  just b/c the gemara explains it one way doesnt make it torah misinai, but enough of my trying to educate you, try reading some of it inside and if will be helpful.  unfortunately for you, i dont think they come in english yet,  but im sure Fink would be happy to translate them for you so you can understand them better...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) Tsk tsk on the name calling. It is punishable with banishment from this community.

2) Had you read carefully enough you would have realized that there were two concerns at all times.  The incorrect reading of the passuk, resulting in misplaced emotions, and a constant posting of blogs that do not represent his mentor.

3) Please explain the disservice.  All I did was post what the author of the blogs knows inside, that he is not following his mentor.  I only asked that he doesn&#039;t treat us as fools, and be an honest person.  Unfortunately, I, in my naivety, thought people are generally honest.  Follow a conversation before you post a comment with no content in it. 

4) You still haven&#039;t gotten to the substance.

5) Nowhere did I proclaim anything to be gospel truth.  Unfortunately, too many people twist the Torah how they see fit, not twisting themselves to fit the Torah.  One is called an eved hashem because they need to work to follow in His path.  ]]></description>

And for the record, don&#039;t go off spouting agadeta from the gerama as gospel truth.

		<description><![CDATA[Wow! That is a truly intellectually honest response.  I feel sorry for your followers, you apparently don&#039;t have the decency or respect for them to be honest.  If you have a response they deserve to hear it, if you don&#039;t they deserve to hear that too.  All I am asking is for you to be honest.  Is that an unrealistic request?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) I did not profess to be a tzaddik, and certainly not one greater than you.

2) You chose a pasuk that you should not have.  Mishlei is there to guide us, not to be used to describe our feelings.

3) You keep going back to the name calling.  Move on.  You choose one word in a post and respond to that.  I am not using the guise of holier than thou, I am simply stating that you are not a student of your mentor.  You have issue with this and are not honest enough with yourself to say that you have strayed from his path.  You can choose your path I have non problem with that.  The Gemora at the end of Taanis 31a says, &quot;At the end of time all the tzadikim will sit in a circle and point to Hashem&quot;.  A circle has no head the same way one approach is not better than another, as long as you are pointing to Hashem.  You can choose your path, but do not profess that it is your mentors. You are not following his path and his name should not be associated with it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) You&#039;re a bigger tzaddik than me. Mazel tov. 

2) I have heard this possuk too. It doesn&#039;t describe my emotions. Sorry. 

3) Um no. Most people know how to have a conversation without name calling. I am happy to have a discussion about anything in the world. I don&#039;t allow ad hominem attacks. So stop or be banned.  Your choice. And I&#039;m not angry at all. Just disappointed that you use a holier than thou approach to insult me under the guise of tzidkus. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) We usually try to fit our feelings within th confines of the Torah not vice versa.  My comprehension is guided as such so I could not understand.  When my &quot;feelings&quot; do not conform to the Torah I work to banish them from my heart.  That is an oved Hashem.

2)B&#039;oved Rashayim Rinah.  Mishlei 11:10

3)  Is this how you answer anyone who strongly disagrees with you.  If i would remove the name calling your response would stay the same.  You&#039;re angry at the attack on your beliefs and that someone tried exposing the truth about your relationship with your mentor.  If you truly cared for him you would disassociate yourself from him.  You are only about yourself as you always have been.  This will never change.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) the words absolutely pertain to my emotions. If you can&#039;t see that it foes to your lack of reading comprehension. 

2) You&#039;re such a holy tzaddik. You only call people names to anonymously protect others. Wow. I bet you would never be able to make your point without calling me names. Baruch Hashem you came to the rescue and called me names. Otherwise we all would have missed your point.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) I am not sure where i went astray in my comprehension.  You used a pasuk that did not pertain to your emotions.  I never said it was halacha, but we generally do not disagree with the words of the Talmud.

2) As for the personal attack, I am just defending your mentor.  He does not know the extent of your writings, and the only reason is because he is being protected from the pain brought on when he hears about it.  You can ban me, i care not.  It will save me time and pain.  I take it personally when a great rabbi&#039;s name is used to promote one&#039;s beliefs that certainly do not come from him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) I don&#039;t profess to be a knowledgable rabbi. I&#039;m just someone trying to be an oved Hashem. 

2) Your reading comprehension needs some work. I simply expressed my feelings in this post. There is no halacha, no morality, no issur v&#039;heter. Just raw emotion. The passuk in Mishlei evokes my feelings. It is not a declaration of law. 

3) Last chance. One more personal attack and you are banned. I have NO PROBLEM with discussion or criticism. But name calling is not allowed. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Fink, your are an ignoramus. You profess to be a knowledgeable rabbi, yet you don&#039;t even know the most basic definition of the pasuk you quoted.  The Gemmorah in Megillah 16a, explains the pasuk as pertaining to Jews only. Mordechai kicked Haman as he climbed on his back to get on the horse, and in response to Haman&#039;s quoting of this pasuk, he said it applies only to the B&#039;nei Yisroel.  I am sure that your metor would certainly agree with you on this, as well your other ignorant blogs you post.  Why don&#039;t you send him a few of them, I am sure his joy would be greater than the world&#039;s today when he sees your words of wisdom, you profess to have gleaned from him.]]></description>
