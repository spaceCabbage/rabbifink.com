		<description><![CDATA[ It isn&#039;t analogous to the case we are discussing at all.  The triangle k is not adding anything to halacha, HZ is trying to add to halacha.  There is plenty of motive behind HZ, I am not saying that there is anything wrong with the idea of an ethical stamp of approval.  Quite the contrary it would be a nice thing, but keep it at just that, don&#039;t add it as a kosher symbol at all, and apply it across the board.  There are thousands of companies engaged in many illegal practices don&#039;t pick out the OJ&#039;s.  They are trying to make a mockery of us, and nothing more.  If they were really about ethics let them join with some vegan organization.  Take it for what it is. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Choosetoswim, I know it isn&#039;t glatt, just like quite a bit of meat sold in Israel. And that&#039;s fine for Ashkenazy OJ&#039;s, but what about Sefardi OJ&#039;s? Why are you not concerned that Sefardi OJ&#039;s are being &quot;led to believe&quot; that their meat is kosher? It&#039;s an analogous case to the case we are discussing.

Shabbat Shalom all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The trinagle K on meat is kosher its just not glatt.  He is not looking to sell it to the orthodox Jew its for the uninformed Jew who will buy a kosher product if its convenient.  You can ask the rabbi yourself.  You may not agree with this approach, I for one don&#039;t because many people make a mistake about the hashgacha but that doesn&#039;t render the food not kosher.  He is trying to do a commendable thing it just comes at the expense of some unassuming OJ.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your so cute with your responses, you should try comedy.

You love denying your intentions by claiming tone means nothings, but you know tone means everything.  Try it on your wife see if your tone makes a difference, I sure she won&#039;t mind how you talk to her.  She probably knows that if you speak to her in an angry tone that you are really being gentile because tones mean nothing.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@yahoo-M5TFA2LNGNXLLMLJJ6GVEK23BQ:disqus , What happens? Well, first of all, let&#039;s decide what to do if it actually happens. Second of all, if it does happen, we will treat it the same way as we treat other questionable or invalid hashgachot (or things that could be construed as a hashgacha). What happens when you see a &quot;K&quot; on products today? What happens when you see a &quot;triangle-K&quot; on meat products today?

As an aside, as far as I know, they&#039;ve yet to put the label on anything. And this is after a few years of a lot of talking. Maybe the whole thing will die out before anything gets accomplished anyway. Who knows, this could be one of those left-leaning feel good things that certain folks like to talk up a storm about, but in the end accomplish little to nothing that effects any meaningful change (or any change at all in some cases).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where do you get your facts from? 

&quot;Also, most other industries are not dominated by Jewish businesses as much as the kosher food industry.&quot;

Really?  The food industry is probably represented by the least Jews compared to other industries.  Most kosher products are produced as &quot;incidently&quot; kosher, an industry a term used to describe a product that happens to be produced kosher but only to expand their market, not because they are Jewish and want to produce kosher and then sell to everyone outside the kosher market.  Most of these items are produced by non-Jewish companies, i.e. Pepsi Coke Nabisco or any other large food company.  Jewish produced items are most often produced exclusively for the Jews not the non-Jewish market. Jewish companies are not found all across America, they are sold to exclusive Jewish supermarkets or supermarkets in highly Jewish areas.

I would also like to add that you have no basis for your claim that the AI does not know what HZ is about.  You have merely decided so and therefore you need not address the concerns of the statement.  Forget for a moment that you know exactly what is in the minds of those in AI and respond to the concerns of the statement substantiated by fact not conjecture.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@yahoo-M5TFA2LNGNXLLMLJJ6GVEK23BQ:disqus  The hechsher tzedek is CLEARLY only going to be placed on product that ALREADY have a kosher sign on them. This is clear and underscores how the hechsher tzedek is in no way intended to replace existing kashrus. I can&#039;t say it enough times until it gets into everyone&#039;s head. Agudath Israel completely MISSED THE BOAT. They have no idea what HT is supposed to be and therefore they made their statement. I don&#039;t need to address their statement when it is based on incorrect information.

AI preys on uneducated Jews as much as MT. AI tells people what to think about things even when they are obviously wrong.

They call themselves the gold standard because in addition to having a hechser on the food, there is a hechsher on the business.

I believe it applies to food because there is a large secular movement that is makpid to only eat food that is wholesome in every sense of the word. I am aware that most frum people don&#039;t care about that kind of thing, but it is understandable that people do not want to eat food that is not made ethically. Also, most other industries are not dominated by Jewish businesses as much as the kosher food industry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@willbe:twitter  - &lt;i&gt;This &quot;Magen Tzedek&quot; stamp preys on uneducated Jews, reinforces false 
assumptions about kashrut, and will lead many Jews to believe that they 
are eating kosher food, when the food itself might not be kosher.&lt;/i&gt;


But the Magen Tzedek will only appear alongside a regular (ingredients, preparations, etc) hashgacha
, so why will the food be non-kosher?

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,

You link to the press release, but don&#039;t answer Agudath Israel&#039;s main concerns.

- If &quot;Magen Tzedek&quot; is interested in certifying ethical businesses, why does this mark only appear on food?  

- If they aren&#039;t trying to redefine kashrut, why do they call themselves &quot;the gold standard of kashrut&quot;?

So many uneducated Jews already think that kashrut has to do with health, cleanliness, or ethics.  None of this is true.

Jews are obligated in the laws of kashrut because G-d said so.  It&#039;s a chok.  (V&#039;lo yaavor).

This &quot;Magen Tzedek&quot; stamp preys on uneducated Jews, reinforces false assumptions about kashrut, and will lead many Jews to believe that they are eating kosher food, when the food itself might not be kosher.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;if anyone is ignorant its the people who dont consider  R Dovid to be important bc he wears a straw hat in the summer.  i hope you dont agree with them. &quot;

Let not your heart be troubled ( I do not agree with them). That said, you  premise--that he&#039;s not widely considered the biggest (or one of the biggest) posek in America--is deeply flawed and evidences what I suspected before--ie, that you have a very limited and rigid view of the yeshiva world. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ of course its not scientific evidence, whats your point? I simply told you i
 asked three random people, all of whom recognized that statement as 
being outside the mainstream. whats so hard to comprehend. 





Either way, i dont need to bother with any other proofs other than the 
fact that rabbi brown said to shut off the cameras before he said the 
story. He wouldn&#039;t ask for cameras to be shut off to say Moshe Kibel 
Torah M&#039;Sinai, he asked them to be shut off bc what he was about to say 
was controvertial aka outside the mainstream. 





as far as i an concerned that proof is the death blow, in think our 
argument abt it is over, rabbi browns acctions in the video support my 
claim, case closed, (and fyi, if you really cared abt the truth instead 
of just being a cintrairian you would have asked to see the video, 
something i offered t send you)





Ani mavin - and you&#039;re just simply wrong.  that is not a mainstream 
opinion, I really dont know your backround but i can really tell that it
 is you who has little knowledge of the yeshiva  world. I know 
everything, all the gossip and in-fights and disagreements between all 
the roshey yeshiva.

I am shocked.

I never said that all those Gedolim&#039;s opinions are the same or that they need to be in order to be great. My POINT was that if R Chaim&#039;s opinion ARE consistent with that of two most prominent Moetzes members than your premise--that R Brown&#039;s comment was out od the mainstream &quot;agudah&quot; circle is not accurate. Atah Maivin? With that in mind--what say you? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ i dont think anyones opinion needs to be consistent  with other people&#039;s opinions. Was R chaim great? yes. Is R Shmuel great? Yes. Do they have different opinions on certain matter of course they do!  You&#039;d have to be a fool to think that R Shmuel and R Dovis are just carbon copies of another person. 

Was Rav Kook a great man, Yes (as per the claim of R Shlomo Zalman Aurbach), were some of the gedolim who didnt agree with him great? Yes. did they share opinions on everything? no. 

Ok, R Joffen was unknown and the reason was because he wasnt they type of guy to be busy putting his signiture on kol kores. I think you;re nitpicking, I would say the even the avarage Lakewood guy never head of him, R Avrom Joffen most have, but R YC? i dont htink so. 

As an aside, i just asked to other people in my office, if rabbi XYZ said the following.......what camp to you think he came from? one said &quot;he must be a leftist&quot; the other said &quot;proabaly young israel&quot;

that&#039;s three for three. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So in conclusion--you think that R&#039; Chaim&#039;s outlook is inconsistent with those held by people like Rav Shmuel Kaminetzky and Rav Dovid Feinstein?

As to Rav Jofen, under appreciated and unknown are two different things. You draw a conclusion of his being unknown based on that he was under-appreciated. I disagree. I think he was widely known as a gaon olam, an iluy atzum, and an emisdike tzadik. Perhaps we swim in different waters. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ and a second thing, yes r joffen was unknown in the yeshive world, that was exactly rabbi browns point in the the shmuze you somehow heard, he said that R yaacov wasnt valued by the yeshiva world, as proven by the poor attendance at this funeral, bc he didnt sign kol kores, etc...

exact;y what that means, is that he was unknown, 

and again this is two issues ive spoken abt re rabbi brown, and in both i am only telling you his words. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ there are sociological differences between R chaim who was in Shanghai and R Malkiel (or any other) rabbi born and raised in NY. Many gedolim, pre the war were against zionism and after the holocaust changed their minds, R Yosef Eliyahu Henkin is one example. 

that R chaim would make that statement, and yes, i am completely aware of his views, is understandable as per his backround and life experiences. A rabbi who is apart of the new world Yeshiva world would not share those opinions. 

Do the aguda rabbis hate IDF soldiers of course not, they arent a part of the eda, but they view, and this is part of their official position that we dont like israel but we will deal with it since it is here. to go so far as to say that the IDF get all the schar for limud torah is above and beyond their official position. 

the only other person who is a contemp. rabbi who is very pro embracing israel is R Aaron Yehuda Leib Sheinamn, that is what they yureshalmies go arounf defacing his pictures on wall sign in mea shearim and leave aloce all teh other pics even though the other rabbis approve of voting, his approval of voting is different. 

i think the fact that the jerusalemites rip his picture and not r elyashiv, two people who ie seen togeteher at a voting rally, proves that their seeminlgy similar opinion is still different from each other. so here to, when rabbi browns statement is far beyond what anyone  else would say. 

AND MY LAST PROOF, is from the actual video which i can send to you, right before Rebbi begins this story he said to shut off the cameras, NO PLEASE TELL ME WHY HE WOULDNT WANT THAT RECORDED. the reason is because it is &quot;controversial&quot; for somone in his position and camp to express such views. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;dont mix issues, i didnt tell you i was in BMG as my credentials, you said i had limited yeshiva world knowledge, and i obviously dont &quot; 
Not what I intended; apologies if that is how it sounded. 
You were using the rabbi&#039;s comments as proof that he was outside the mainstream. I challenged that as I do not believe that they are. 
I do not know R&#039; Malkiel well enough to say definittively. I do know that is shittas are not necessarily representative of  &quot;Lakewood&quot; as people commonly refer to it, nor is he always representative of the majority of the Moetzes, nor Agudah policy. 
Could you see R&#039; Chaim as saying the same thing as Rabbi Brown? How about RYCJ? Would that not support my premise and undermine yours?]]></description>

Yes, you accused me of calling rabbi brown a zionist when i clearly had not. 

no, you never provided any facts at all, all you said, was yes they are in the mainstream and i said now they are not and you said yes they are. then i pulled in a third person who agreed with me, so if anyone even attempted to provide a drop of proof their claims it was ONLY me. 

You really think for one second that R Malkiel Kotler would say those words? are you out of your mind?

		<description><![CDATA[@Choosetoswim:disqus, ego? Are you nuts? It would be so much easier for R&#039; Fink to simply not say anything on these kinds of topics and stick to the regular dvar Torah, and tame news reports. Do you think his discussions about these things make his life easier? No way. Also, do you think the investment of time to maintain a blog is easy? It isn&#039;t, it takes quite a lot of time, especially for bloggers that interact with their commenters. The only, or at least main, reason these things are discussed is because R&#039; Fink believes that the discussion improves the Jewish world. And I largely agree.

And in general, bloggers have to promote their blog if they want people to read and comment. That includes tweeting notices about new posts, tweeting about &quot;hot&quot; discussions going on (like 100 comments, etc), and it includes other folks (like me) tweeting links to the post. Look below and you will see that 5 or 6 people also tweeted links to this post. Are you going to claim that those people also did that due to ego? It&#039;s amazing to me that a purported &quot;believer&quot; can&#039;t believe that others believe as well, though perhaps differently on certain issues.

As far as why use a blog rather than some other method, it&#039;s entirely obvious. On a blog hundreds or thousands of people from all walks of life and from all sorts of places can hear and discuss, in shul in front of the congregation only 100 people can hear, and some might not be paying attention (or aren&#039;t interested). On the blog everyone is interested because they specifically chose to put it on their screen and read it and perhaps a few comment as well. Most importantly, the blog allows for an open and clean conversation that flow relatively well. That can&#039;t happen anywhere else.]]></description>

Ok, now you&#039;re getting me a little concerned about your lucidity.  I NEVER expressed a problem with what you said he said. On the contrary, my point was that those statements are NOT outside the mainstream. I then repeatedly challenged you to provide facts indicating the contrary. You still have not. This has nothing to do with being a nogeah bedover, it has to do with knowledge. If I am suggesting that your thinking that such comments are outside the mainstream/non-Agudist are based on your lack of information, then why should I think that your friend is any different? I am impressed  that you learned in Mir and BMG. Now some substantive facts please?]]></description>

pot calling the kettle black

&quot;limited knowledge of the yeshiva world at large.&quot;

you dont know anything about me, I learned in the Mir in israel and in Lakewood BMG, but again, i dont know anything about you or why you think your opinion has any value. 

again with the facts, i told you what he said, YOU dont like what he said, so you keep trying to deny it, but sorry buddy, he said it and you have to deal with it. 

and yes, getting someone who doesnt know rabbi brown, and i didnt even say a name , agreeing that the opinion is a mizrachi opinion , is a pretty relialble argument as to what i was saying. someone who isnt a nogea bedover (you) is not a good source, since you clearly dont like the idea that rabbi brown shares an opinion with people outside his capm. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Woah there cowboy, slowdown.  
First of all, there is a difference between &quot;owning&quot; something and sayin the torah &quot;belongs&quot; to them--which was what you originally said. That said, the fact that you &quot;tested this out with a freind&quot; is hardly a proof of anything, especially when I raised suspicion that your opinions are rooted in your limited knowledge of the yeshiva world at large. Asking a friend does not dispell that. Provideing facts to the contrary about relevant rabbis and/or rosh yeshivas would. 

I dont&#039;t have any &quot;credentials&quot;. This is not about me. Stick to the substance. Let&#039;s talk facts and not get into a ya-hu nuh-uh kind of thing. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ ok, thank god , now where getting somewhere, 

the idea that a secular idf soldier who most likely never studied a word of Torah in his or her life, still &#039;owns&#039; all the Torah of all the people learning torah in Eretz Israel, is a mizrachi/religious zionist opinion. 

i DO have factual information, i provided you with a quote from rabbi brown, i told you his words. Let me guess you still dont believe Obama was born in the USa even though he let out his B cert. 

i just tested this out with a friend, i told him the quote and asked what kind of a rabbi would say that, his reponse was probably a YU musmach, its a mizrachi type opinion (his words)

anyway, i am a student of rabbi brown, you know what my face looks like. at lease tell me what your credentials are to even comment on what he does or doesn think?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is the only one you have because you created for your own ego.  You never were a person of substance who would go out there and do what needs to be done, unless you saw some great benefit for yourself.  If you were after the truth you would seek the reasons behind their  decision, not vehemently attack their approach. But this really about self promotion and you get none of that by trying to do things where no one can see.

This just proves my point &quot;100 comments: http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/04/agudath-israel-misses-the-boat-on-magen-tzedek/&quot;. That is from your twitter account.  If it was about the truth you would not care about how many comments you have reached.  Oh and by the way most of these comments have nothing to do with the topic, they are about other issues that are irrelevant to the original post.  But we do not need to be truly honest only enough to fool everyone.]]></description>
