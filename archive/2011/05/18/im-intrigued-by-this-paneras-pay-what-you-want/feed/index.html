		<description><![CDATA[I once read an article about a restaurant like this in Jerusalem.  It looks and feels like a typical Jerusalem casual dining restaurant.  The only difference is, there are no prices listed on the menu.  All employees (including wait staff) are volunteers; all of the food is donated.  There is a large donation box (a.k.a pushke) as you exit the eatery, with a sign asking for donations.  

In this case, it provided an opportunity for those who are hungry to receive charity with dignity.  At the same time, the food was good enough to attract paying customers as well.  They (as in the Panera restaurant) intentionally paid more than what their meal would have cost in a regular restaurant.

It sounds like an amazing concept.  If I knew of such an establishment nearby, I would prefer to eat there, and to voluntarily pay a few dollars more for my food, knowing that it would help feed someone who might not otherwise eat a real meal that day.]]></description>
