		<description><![CDATA[&gt;&gt;DovBear - the fact that E Fink associates with you is itself a massive blemish on him. you are a colossal imbicile. you are not a scholar, thinker or talmudist. you are a blogger. Get over it. Those of us who know anything about Torah consider you to be a fool. That is why we pay no attention to your assertion that &quot;it&#039;s ok to argue with the talmud.&quot; Get lost please. if i wanted your drivel, I would check your site. [I am fast growing to feel that this site is similar enough to yours to warrant my ignoring it entirely as well. we shall see]

Dear GJ (or is it ES?) 

I notice you lack the ability to provide any meaningful response to what I wrote. In short you are a fool, and here are the reasons:

(1) You don&#039;t know what infirmity means;
(2) You think the Gemarah ruled the women can&#039;t learn Torah, when it facts its one man d&#039;amar, quoted by the mishna
(3) You think its forbidden to disagree with this man d&#039;amar even though the Mishna itse;f quotes two other tannas who disagreed with it
(4) You think its forbidden to disagree with the Gemarah even though the list of rishonim, achronim, and contemporary Orhtodox Rabbis who disagreed with the Gemarah on matters large and small is long enough to fill a library.  If you&#039;re even a slightly serious person you&#039;ll review the list, and modify your erroneous view.

When I pointed this out earlier, all you were able to do in reply was attack my reputation, and be insulting. I&#039;ve repeated my arguments against your point of view in the hopes that you will either confess that you were wrong, or mount a serious and intelligent response. I doubt you will do either, as you seem quite dim, and quite arrogant about your dimness, but I remain optimistic. ]]></description>

forget the opinions of later Rabbis, what do your observations tell you? are women less intelligent than men? do women not have the sort of intelligence needed to be educated in the talmud? 

I imagine, that if you don&#039;t live in a basement or at least get out once in a while you must answer that woman can be  just as educated and are indeed just as intelligent as men are. They successfully play every part in society that men do. 

Dont hide behind the Talmud to cover your misogynistic and sexist opinions. What do you say? What does using your won brain and thinking abilities tell you? 

women study every sort of topic out there, they are in every feild of study, business, academia. No one needs to argue with the Talmud, or what you think the Talmud says. Realty does a well enough job for us. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[GJ, you are so stupid, and so misinformed, it takes away my breath.

First, look up the meaning of the word infirmity before you spout. E-fink used it correctly. Here&#039;s the dictionary:
in·fir·mi·ty/inˈfərmitē/Noun: Physical or mental weakness. Second, the gemarah did say that women were too stupid to learn Talmud, or rather one man d&#039;amar said this, namely Rabbi Eliezer. But two others disagreed with him on the spot. So how can you claim that we can&#039;t disagree with the Gemarah, when the Mishna itself quotes two people who disagreed with Rabbi Eliezer?  In fact, the first opinion the Mishna cites is ben Azzai who says a father is OBLIGATED to teach his daughter gemarah.Third, and finally, its perfectly ok to disagree with the gemarah, and doing so does not make you a &quot;conservative Rabbi&quot;. Plenty of Orthodox Rabbis say its fine to disagree with the Gemarah, though some, but not all of them, limit this permission to specific circumstances.Here&#039;s my post on women learning Gemarah: http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2007/06/bad-news-for-bruriah.html and http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2006/10/mrs-mysogynist.html

		<description><![CDATA[they never premitted the study of Gemara or mishna for women. Only written with the commentaries of Rashi and Ramban etc. since we are not Karaites and there is no other option, [along with halacha which they were always responsible to study -see Magen Avraham to Hil. talmud torah] that is something that Rambam paskens &quot;lichatchila one should not teach a girl,&quot; but was ruled that bidieved, other reasons made it important to teach it. This was all in keeping with the halacha. none of it was based upon &quot;nah, now the gemara is no longer right, since this was unfair.&quot; your claims are that the gemara was based upon something that is unfair, and not true. do you think that women were stupid then or something? infirm of mind? or just that the rabbis were mislead? Can you answer this? you have claimed that you understand the gemara and rambam to be saying that most women are weak and infirm of mind. is that true? was it true then? or were they wrong. The chofetz chaim made rulings that never negated the gemara but were rather his sincerest attempt at applying the talmud, based upon his mastery of it, to the situation. It does not at all appear that you are doing so. You on you own decided what is &quot;fair,&quot; and that thoguh we are mevarech on the things that appear rah, we neverthless go on feeling that &quot;life is unfair,&quot; rather than learning the lesson that everything is meted out from above, and we must bless on all of it, for it is all blessing-worthy. Please clarify - do you think that the women in the time of the talmud were too stupid and infirm and weak of mind (for that is how you somehow translated &quot;daatan michuvanot lihitlamed&quot;) to be taught just as te boys were from a young age, or do you tihnk that they were merely &quot;believed to be&quot; that way, but the Rabbis were wrong about that. This is were it appears that you diverge from the talmud in the way that the conservatives do, and the Chofetz Chaim did not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[infirm minds?! That is absurd. Rambam, that you cited, said that women do no have the sort of intelligence to be educated in the talmud. Oral law. for they bring the Torah in to words of foolishness according to the impoverished intellects. This was not about some infirmity. Come on. Be honest. You can disagree with the talmud, which u seem to do. So did the great conservative Rabbis of our time. Most of us out here have grown to see you as the fraud that you are. I dont&#039; know you, but I have known your father for many years. Does he feel as you do on this topic regarding women&#039;s roles? He is an educator - does he feel that there needs to be a major shift in how we raise bnos yisrael? Is there a reason why he only posts divrei Torah, but never comments on the blog not matter how far you stray from Traditional Torah Values?]]></description>

Oral law. for they bring the Torah in to words of foolishness according to the impoverished intellects. This was not about some infirmity. Come on. Be honest. You can disagree with the talmud, which u seem to do. So did the great conservative Rabbis of our time. Most of us out here have grown to see you as the fraud that you are. I dont&#8217; know you, but I have known your father for many years. Does he feel as you do on this topic regarding women&#8217;s roles? He is an educator &#8211; does he feel that there needs to be a major shift in how we raise bnos yisrael? Is there a reason why he only posts divrei Torah, but never comments on the blog not matter how far you stray from Traditional Torah Values?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; I welcome the Lakewood model as an option. I believe it is unsustainable as a whole and misapplied in many instances. That is not related to the issue of whether it is an acceptable model for some.

&gt; I said &quot;not surprising&quot;. I did not say &quot;what do you expect&quot;. And I it was a play on two types of backwards. (I can&#039;t believe I need to spell this out for you.) One is their backwards mentality regarding progress and modernity and now it has manifested in a second way, meaning they are dealing with real issues of dissent in a backwards way, d&#039;hynu, focusing on their &quot;reputation&quot; instead of their issues.

&gt; I don&#039;t agree that the Talmud has a set approach to women. Further, if, as was commonly held at the time, women were believed to be infirm or too frail to study Torah, there is no chiyuv to keep that mistakenly held belief today. And as evidenced by clear piskei halacha in the last century, we have already deviated from the norms and standards of Europe with regard to teaching women Torah. So you are being disingenuous by invoking the &quot;talmudic&quot; standard of women and Torah when that has already been discarded everywhere in the Torah world.

&gt; No. I learned that the appropriate bracha is kshem shemvarchim al hatov kach mevarchim al harah. There is rah. It can be harsh and unfair. It is not fair that I cannot be a kohen or a levi. It is not fair that I cannot do the mitzvos that only were able to be performed in the times of the mikdash. There is no fairness in any of our circumstances.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding
the kollel &quot;backwards&quot; lifestlyle, you wrote &quot; I have no problem with it. I welcome it. &quot;


Yet you recently wrote that you do not think
it can be taken seriously, and has to be rethought (i am pretty certain that
you were stronger about it. but am not looking back at that essay at the
moment)


Regarding when you called New Square backwards
- after talking about a despicable act there, you said &quot;What else would
you expect from a backwards place.&quot; that seems to be using the word
backward to mean what it ususally means, &quot;less civilized, less caring,
barbaric...&quot; that is the usage of the word in contemprary parlance, and
that is how you used it. that is not something they would readily agree to.









To compare a change in lakewood of people
learning and working which is not against the rabbis of the talmud (even Rambam
who didn;t like people taking from charity was fine with wives supporting
husbands - and even he was a complete daas yachid) to saying that the
talmudic/torah approach to men and women should be changed is a seriously
different statement. don&#039;t you see that? 


 


As a believer in God, it is absolutely fair
when a person is born with less money, or less intelligent. Perhaps we do not
always understand that, but we are not allowed to talk that way. You must have
learned this in Rabbinic school when reading the liturgy surrounding death that
we recite. Dayan HaEmet, etc. Is that not right?

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;I would say that right and wrong are your only department. What is right and wrong it what we turn to spirituality and out spiritual leaders for.&lt;/i&gt;

I view my role differently. I educate and inspire. Matters of right and wrong are mostly predetermined. If there is a grey are or an area that I believe needs change I can voice my opinion and support it with reasoning and sources. But declarations of right and wrong? No.

&lt;i&gt;It seems to me that &quot;this is unfair&quot; means &quot;this is wrong,&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

Well then YOU would be wrong. Were you born into a billionaire family? The other guy was? Is that fair? No. Is it wrong? No. Were you born as smart as Einstein? Is that fair? No. Is it wrong? No.

&lt;i&gt;Sideswipes at Lakewood&lt;/i&gt;

Touchy touchy. I did not take an swipes, sideways or otherwise. I was merely stating a fact. The fact remains, women&#039;s roles have changed based on time and place. I used Lakewood as an example. Yaffa Eliach notwithstanding, Lakewood&#039;s current gender roles are a departure from prior gender roles in Lakewood the shtetl from which it arose. I have no problem with it. I welcome it. I just wish that others would be so welcoming of other shifts in gender roles.

&lt;i&gt; similar to New Square which you used that epithet about&lt;/i&gt;

Funny how you call it an epithet and they take it as a compliment. Their entire society is openly built on turning back the clock. The readily admit it. It&#039;s not even a controversial statement.

&lt;i&gt;defend an attack on the Rabbi&#039;s of the Talmud&lt;/i&gt;

I must have missed where that happened. I did not see an attack or a defense. But I am not as adept at reading between the lines to see some hidden evil meaning in my words than you.

&lt;i&gt;shame on you&lt;/i&gt;

The self righteousness of the anonymous Internet commenter will never cease to amuse me. I have nothing to be ashamed of. It is not your approval I seek.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[wrong? not my department.as a Rabbi, I would say that right and wrong are your only department. What is right and wrong it what we turn to spirituality and out spiritual leaders for.
It seems to me that &quot;this is unfair&quot; means &quot;this is wrong,&quot; when coming from a person who is telling us how the world should be, which is what Rabbi&#039;s are meant to be doing, and what you do often on this site.
It should also be noted that Yaffa Eliach in her The Once Was a World, which is a chronicle of the city of Eishyshok in pre-war Europe for close to a thousand years (!) writes that the men did not speak tha language of the country while the women did, for the men all learned and the wives worked to support them. This lasted, she writes until the Haskala. She claims this was the norm in many places across Europe. The woman would mind the stores, and the men would study most of/all of the day. Historically, Rav Yosef Karo in his Kesef Mishna (Laws of Torah Study) also claims that in the times of Hillel, there were tens of thousands who were being supported by the community to learn Torah full time. Sideswipes at Lakewood (a place that you clearly think is somewhat backwards - it&#039;s quite similar to New Square which you used that epithet about) are out of place in a comment where you defend an attack on the Rabbi&#039;s of the Talmud, and the taditional Orthdox approach to men and women. shame on you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Are you saying that the traditional talmidic/halachik attitude is wrong? When you say it is unfair, that is what it sounds like.&lt;/i&gt;
Wrong? Not my department. Unfair? Yes. But as I am sure your parents told you when you were a child, &quot;life isn&#039;t fair&quot;.

&lt;i&gt;Do you think that things should be changed, and that all along, women really should have had different roles?&lt;/i&gt;

I do think things should be adjusted. I also think they ARE being adjusted. Women&#039;s roles have changed several times based on time and location throughout history. In fact, in Lakewood they just changed in the last two decades from raising children in the home to working to support husbands.

&lt;i&gt;I imagine you would say that black people should have been treated equally, and that that was wrong. Itchemeyer compares this to how the Rabbis of the talmud and codes treated women. You seem to agree. I find that surprising. Do you?&lt;/i&gt;

You are drawing too many inferences. Black people were enslaved, bought, sold, killed, lynched, marginalized in every single possible way and fought for 60 years just to be treated as humans. To insinuate that women&#039;s liberation is even in the same category is insulting in my opinion.

The comparison is only being made to demonstrate how to effect change. V&#039;hamayvin yavin.]]></description>

Wrong? Not my department. Unfair? Yes. But as I am sure your parents told you when you were a child, &#8220;life isn&#8217;t fair&#8221;.</p>
<p><i>Do you think that things should be changed, and that all along, women really should have had different roles?</i></p>
<p>I do think things should be adjusted. I also think they ARE being adjusted. Women&#8217;s roles have changed several times based on time and location throughout history. In fact, in Lakewood they just changed in the last two decades from raising children in the home to working to support husbands.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Does the fact that  &#039;inherently, separate was not equal&#039; give you any questions about women&#039;s status in the torah? I know it does for me. If only a certain group of people (men) are divinely mandated into power, for whatever reason, they are not forced to consider the welfare of  the powerless group (this was solved in America through integration).  More than that, a woman&#039;s eidus isn&#039;t even valid! I have no problem accepting that nashin daatun kalos hein was true in ancient times. However, the system becomes inherently unfair when you put women&#039;s rights at the mercy of men.

Sorry for throwing this in here, you just hit a nerve because I was thinking about this whole separate but equal thing over yontif.]]></description>
