		<description><![CDATA[Since the 1960s, the left has had an uneasy relationship with sports whose participants are a thinly veiled abstraction of the warrior class and whose ethos lauding the salutary benefits of competition, the sanctioning of aggression and an uncompromising standard of excellence have been largely seen as impediments by the ruling elites who find in such activity an obstacle to the cultivation of individual self esteem and a culture of mutual affirmation and collective empathy. 
 
The connection of sports to crime has a pedigree stretching back as far as the Whig Party’s concern that sports, just then finding democratic expression in this country largely among the immigrant and Catholic working class communities, was an invitation to public vice and loose morals.  As recently as two decades ago, NOW issued the results of a fraudulent study claiming a higher incidents of violence against woman on Super Bowl Sunday. In all of these cases, including the article to which I am responding, the real issue is one not of the negative social impact of sports but the connection of virtue to character.
 
The left’s contribution to evolving notions of the masculine ideal has been to substitute masculine virtue for an androgynous appeal which accounts for the inability of the feminist movement to articulate any desirable qualities traditionally associated with feminism.  Uncivilized males, disproportionately the product families raised by single mothers, have found their natural and primitive expression in the tribal social structure of inner city gangs while among the middle and upper classes, the phenomenon of the perpetual adolescent male has become a permanent fixture of the contemporary culture. 
 
Crime is a result of bad values and a civilization that has lost sight of the connection of virtue to character must contend with its consequences.  Some blame may accrue to sport’s transition from play to entertainment and a fascination with spectacle at the expense of religion but issues such as this article raises simple confuse the perceived influences of vice with an absence of virtue while ignoring the more interesting question of whether virtue may have been degraded by the trivialization of athletics?   ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[just look at baseball or hockey and see if the police blotter for those sports comes close.  i would bet not.

or why are we just looking at sports. lets take all the employees of goldman sachs. or ernst &amp; young, or KPMG, etc...

these players are paid millions of dollars and now want even more and then a spokesman for the players (someone who has is own dubious criminal past) comes out and says, if there isnt football its going to be bad since it will cause more crime since fans will be upset, or have more free time on sundays, or whatever other nonsensical reason.  

the truth is the NFL should stand for the Nothing but Felons League.  dont go around warning other about crime rates until you bring your own down.  as it stands now, when you talk crime and NFL the only thing most ppl think about is the Players who commit those crimes and get away with it...]]></description>
