		<description><![CDATA[You point is well taken. The Talmud ultimately chooses based on a variety of factors and truth may or may not be the only factor. The difference is that the opinions in the Talmud are rooted in a pursuit of truth and NOT in the pursuit of being right. Whereas in secular law and in general arguments, it could be argued that reason for the argument is win as opposed to finding some truth.

In the judicial system truth is never the goal. The goal is who has made a better argument to support their position. IE who has won. The &quot;proof&quot; is that the standards for a jury to decide a case are not based on truth but rather their level of being convinced by the evidence. IE who has won...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not certain that the Talmud doesn&#039;t function according to your characterization of the law. In many cases, it seems the Talmud is concerned with implementing law as a policy, based as much as possible on the truth, but ultimately relying on a series of requirements for proof, just like in a legal case. Rav X&#039;s statement has a source in Scripture or in a Beraisa, but Rav Y&#039;s does not, or Rav Y&#039;s Scriptural proof is co-opted by Rav X for a different purpose, and the Sages like that usage more, because if better fulfills some other requirement, or makes a for a more cogent argument according to common reason, etc.


The search for truth is out there, and of course formal standards and common sense creep into any search for truth, but the legal system generally does conform to some sort of &quot;show&quot; where the arbiters must judge how well a case is made, usually according to some accepted conditions for proof or rationale established by precedent.]]></description>
