		<description><![CDATA[&#062;I agree that minors should not be playing those games. But I do not think that the government’s job is make those decisions
That wasn&#039;t what the law said was it??? It&#039;s that a minor can&#039;t BUY a game. A parent can still buy it for them no?]]></description>
