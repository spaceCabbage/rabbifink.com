		<description><![CDATA[While the numbers may beÂ exaggeratedÂ the issue is a real issue. Â Teens today are not being given the feelings of being a Jew. Â Most teens only here their parents complain about how hard it is to be Jewish. Â Who can blame them, why would anyone want to live a burdensome life filled with rules and laws they cannot violate. Â I once heard a shuir from R&#039; Dovid Orlofsky in which he told over the following story (I heard this over ten years ago, but it is more true than ever). Â When speaking for a group of modern OJ teens one Friday night he presented the crowd with a theoretical option. Â A remote with two buttons on it. Push button A and everything remains the same, you wake up the next morning you are Jewish and nothing changed. Â Push button B and you wake up the next morning and you are not Jewish and never were. Â He speculated that 75% or more would choose button B. Â One teen raised his hand and said &quot;Rabbi you got it all wrong, everyone of us would push B&quot;. Â 
The teen stated what everyone of those kids thought Judaism is a burden. Â Why should they want it. Â This stems from the parents lack of faith and feeling for their religion. Â Children need to be instilled with the desire to be Jewish, they have to hear how great it is to be Jewish. Â Parents are the main providers of the &quot;mesorah&quot; of what it means to live and breath yiddishkeit. Â The schools can only help, they cannotÂ ingrainÂ this in every child, you may have the exception of a child turned on by his rebbe, but that is not the norm. Â As role models, parents must watch their every word and move when it comes to religion too. Â Just like a partne won&#039;t use foul language as no to teach their kids, they cannot speak negatively of Judaism either.
I once heard from a rebbe of mine that R&#039; Moshe Feinstein said the reason children were going off the derech were because parents would say &quot;is shver tzu zein a yid - it is hard to be a Jew&quot;.Â ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve sat in coffee shops and watched two people, each with their own laptop open in front of them, instant message to one another back and forth. Â At a recent social event I watched the teenage daughter of a friend sit for one hour straight pounding away with her thumbs at her tiny keyboard. Â I&#039;ve had friends who have done job interviews tell him how they&#039;ve had job seekers say &quot;excuse me&quot; halfway through an interview and then pull out their cellphone to respond to a text they&#039;d just received.
No, they&#039;re not exclusively limited to that kind of communication but it is as much a part of their day as talking to real people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[
I saw the article, and I also thought that the numbers were greatly exaggerated. Â I also agree that experimentation and rebellion is normal for that age group, and doesn&#039;t necessarily signal a major crisis in frumkeit.

I know that in our community , keeping shabbat is not only normal, it&#039;s &quot;cool&quot;. Â Teens want to rebel from their parents, and simultaneously want to conform to their peers. Â If they have a peer group which validates shabbat observance as &quot;the cool choice&quot;, then they will be more likely to continue doing so. Â Even better, they will do so out of their own choosing, not Â because of parental insistence.

I&#039;m certainly no expert, but it seems to me that our youth groups play a key role in establishing shabbat (and indeed kashrut, tzniut, etc.) as the &quot;in thing&quot; to do. Â Perhaps if more synagogues started or expanded their teen programming, and committed significant resources to staff and program these groups, that we would not see such troubling (and frankly, embarrassing) articles appear.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s true. Electronic devices (not light bulbs) are hard to pin down as far as a halachic prohibition.

Unfortunately, even R&#039; Shlomo Zalman Aurbach who disproved pretty  much all the theories to prohibit maintains that despite no tangible halachic prohibition, they remain prohibited on Shabbos.

In eyes of man it is a big deal. They are rebelling and we, as halachically observant Jews should stand firm that cell phones are prohibited on Shabbos.

When they get to the great courtroom in sky they and we will find out for sure...

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Perhaps many of these kids are texting simply because they don&#039;t know how to socialize any other way.&lt;/i&gt;

Garnel, they socialize in many ways, texting is just one of the ways. It&#039;s silly to make such absolute statements that don&#039;t even pass the common-sense test. I mean, seriously, have you ever observed a group of teens? There&#039;s chatter all the time.
People used to talk, and that was the only method of communication, then they started to write letters. But writing letters didn&#039;t supplant talking entirely, it just joined talking as an additional method of communication. Same with the telegraph, the telephone, email, etc. Now texting has joined our methods of communicating with one another. It is just one more method of communication, but it doesn&#039;t completely supplant former methods of communication.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is that during the week most people don&#039;t actually speak to one another anymore. Â They instant message or twitter or update their Facebook status or they text. Â Suddenly comes Shabbos and people have no idea what to do next. Â How do you expect a generation raised in front of a video screen to understand what it&#039;s like to walk in the park or toss a ball around for real instead of with a controller?
