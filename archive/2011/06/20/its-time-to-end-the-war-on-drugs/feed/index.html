		<description><![CDATA[In cities and in rural areas, almost all &quot;beat&quot; cops used to be neighborhood cops. They didn&#039;t necessarily come from that neighborhood, but very often they did. But they were assigned to a neighborhood for the long-term. That meant that they walked around the neighborhood most days, it also meant that they knew many of the neighborhood folks, and they knew who to &quot;keep an eye on&quot;. For example, they knew which teens were &quot;troublemakers&quot; and could keep tabs on them and even warn them off when the cop thought it might be likely they would be attracted to something new and interesting where they could make trouble. In rural areas, cops were neighborhood cops by default due to the small population and small local police forces.

Neighborhood cops are pretty much a thing of the past. I think for various reasons, one, the hierarchy and need to advance in rank and responsibility by most (better educated) cops (today). Two, cops get bored with single-neighborhood (certain ones obviously) work and want to move on every few years. Three, cops get burned out with single neighborhood (certain other ones obviously) work and want to move on. There are many different police agencies available nowadays and cops often move to different agencies early in the careers, perhaps from local PD to county sheriff dept, or to state police (part of the general phenomenon of increased mobility by employees in the USA). Some even (rarely) move on to the FBI or other national law enforcement organizations (sometimes after earning a law degree). Finally, many retire as early as possible and then move to private security companies. It&#039;s not like the 50&#039;s when a cop spent 30 or 40 years in a single neighborhood.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Plenty join. They are moved to other neighborhoods.

Being from the neighborhood means understanding the needs of the community.

All police work is decided based on a priority list. There is selective enforcement and engagement.

I think you ? button is broken. When you press it once, like 6 or 7 ?s come out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Sure, is it possible, that the stigma will be relaxed somewhat because the activity is legal? Sure, I suppose. But how much, alreay?
I think a lot more than we expect...but I hope you are correct.

&#062;I think you said above that you believe the decriminalization of adultery or something has contributed to laxer standards of public decency, and I would disagree, but that&#039;s not even relevant here.

No, I argued against R&#039; Fink that initially said things around us do not create negative impressions on people. My example was an overly sexualized society caused by the media (in all its manifestations). It wasn&#039;t against adultry per say, but I did mention the billboard of ashleymadison.com. For there to even be a public billboard like just shows the digression. But this was mostly an argument that things around us affect us. That&#039;s all. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;That&#039;s not how it goes. Cops decide which corners and blocks to do their arrests. They can get great stats in a rough part of town. But the people who live a few blocks away would rather they focus on people speeding down their residential street and are happy to let the rough part of town beat up themselves.

Huh? Are you saying the cops should not focus on the rough spots????

&#062;I mean where they address community concerns.


Yes, they do that. I don&#039;t know how often, but they do that. I have a friend in the LAPD and in the sheriff. Part of their great efforts is to be connected to those areas. Do you ever talk to PD&#039;s?

&#062;Cops from the neighborhood that know the people in the neighborhood. As it is, cops in bad neighborhoods are all from the &quot;outside&quot; which creates an adversarial dynamic.


1) How many people from those neighborhoods are joiing the forces??? 2) After reqruitment, you are placed depending where the force needs the most help. 3) I am not sure what a cop from that neighborhood is going to do differently. Is he supposed to turn a blind eye? ALL COPS, are supposed to follow the law and rules of engagement. Your comment that somehow only a person from that &#039;hood&#039; can properly police is an insult to anyone that actually puts their lives on the line in those dangerous areas. It&#039;s also insulting to the people that actually live there. You don&#039;t think they can do their part in the adversarial dynamic? Are they some lesser people that can only relate to a &#039; brother from their hood?&#039; It reminds of when people complain about Israel antagonizing the Palestinians into attacking Israel. And I always thought that was such an insult to the Palestinians that somehow, we can&#039;t expect from  NOT to attack like some bulldog the same way we expect from others. Should only rich white police officers patrol beverly hills, since they can better relate to them there too????]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;They ruin their lives, and ruin the lives of those around them. I believe them to be a people (in general) that simply care about their selfish need for instant gratification of altering their minds. These are all character traits. I think character traits are important in people. I have YET to meet anyone that taking hard drugs has improved their lives and their character. For now, all I know of are those that have destroyed their lives.

Ah, but precisely! All these negative and harmful effects will continue to exist once drugs are legalized. Doing drugs will still make you a halfwit, or a loser, or signal that you likely have poor credit. The stigma remains! Sure, is it possible, that the stigma will be relaxed somewhat because the activity is legal? Sure, I suppose. But how much, alreay? Doing drugs then will be just as stupid and self-defeating as doing drugs today.

I think you said above that you believe the decriminalization of adultery or something has contributed to laxer standards of public decency, and I would disagree, but that&#039;s not even relevant here. Adultery is immoral, but not really against an adulterers interest. Unless a shotgun gets involved, adultery is good, clean fun. But poisoning one&#039;s self has readily cognizable consequences, which dissuade people much more effectively than the law. There&#039;s no real reason for that calculus to change. The stigma will stick, by and large.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Well, we&#039;re not without our influence. We supply most of their demand. If we make drugs illegal, it stands to reason less Mexicans will be murdered by the drug trade. Would you prefer that more Mexicans die, so that we can preserve our virtue? 


Yes, we help influence them. Yes, they should have seen this coming years and years ago what with their corupt law enforcement and their incompetence. But to fix Mexico&#039;s problems, I am to introduce something legal what I believe to be wrong into this country now?

&#062;Here is where I want you to dig deeper. In what sense can you not depend on it? Do you think that pilots will fly jumbo jets while high (ha ha pun!)? Will the president be hopped up on acid while negotiating on the White House  jumbotron with supervillains? Will people drive intoxicated? Will teachers sell drugs to their classes? 


There is no digging deeper Vox. It&#039;s axiomatic. Why do MOST parents not want their kids around other people do drugs? It isn&#039;t because they are afraid the other person might drive high or because they are afraid they might grow up to be a high president.  I consider people that dope on drugs to be lesser in their quality. They ruin their lives, and ruin the lives of those around them. I believe them to be a people (in general) that simply care about their selfish need for instant gratification of altering their minds. These are all character traits. I think character traits are important in people. I have YET to meet anyone that taking hard drugs has improved their lives and their character.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Mutual goals. 
Cops are there to protect those people that want to lead a law abiding life. What other mutual goal is there?

&#062;Community meetings. 

They already do that.

&#062;Local cops.

What does that mean? 

&#062;Less arrests. I could go on...

Change the laws...less arrests. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HH - &lt;i&gt;Would I care if I knew someone smoked? Would I care if someone drank? Would I care if someone took PCP?&lt;/i&gt;

I don&#039;t care about any of these ... until they affect me or my loved ones.

I don&#039;t care if someone smokes ... unless they do it one table over from where I am sitting eating dinner.
I don&#039;t care if someone drinks ... unless they get in the car and hurt or kill someone afterward.
I don&#039;t care if someone uses PCP ... unless they rob me to get the money to buy it, or drive, etc while high on it.

That&#039;s a very disingenuous response. You know well that the bulk of the problems in Mexico are due to the insatiable demand we have here in the USA for illegal drugs &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; the fact that we are willing to pay premium prices for it. It has less to do with internal Mexican policies about drugs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HH - &lt;i&gt;That is basically an argument not to imprison anyone then. Hence my point: Someone that was found snorking coke at a party....should he spend time in jail????&lt;/i&gt;

Nope. It&#039;s an argument to imprison those who commit crimes. Crimes that affect others adversely, or crimes that involve ill-gotten gains. Even if certain drugs are legalized, if a guy decides to sell them outside the law (not licensed, impure or adulterated in a way that isn&#039;t legal, in an unsafe manner, to a minor, etc) then he should be imprisoned for those crimes. Just as a shopkeeper that sells booze to minors would be prosecuted.]]></description>

Really? So why do so many people drink and then operate a motor vehicle and thereby kill 20 or 30 thousand people a year?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HH - &lt;i&gt;Proof of what? You have proof the sentencing structure does not work for drug use. You have proof that a lot of money is used for the war on drugs. You don&#039;t have proof of what might happen if hard drugs are legalized. You don&#039;t  have proof of how much money the government will eventually put up (and you know it WILL happen, because the people are going to demand the government get involved) for medical costs and further addiction prevention. You are getting rid of one problem, but lets not be naive here....we will just be inheriting another problem. One can argue one problem is preferable to another. But proof? How much proof can you have to something that has not been done yet and the affect it will have on society.&lt;/i&gt;

The proof is that drugs have been illegal for a while now. Since they became illegal, and since drug crime has be prosecuted more vigorously, there is more and more violence and crime related to drugs. The proof is that there are 2 million people behind bars. Furthermore, we &lt;b&gt;ALREADY&lt;/b&gt; have plenty of people doing drugs, we already have plenty of government spending, mostly on incarceration and the legal process, and some on treatment. Obviously there is no proof regarding what might happen in the future; That&#039;s impossible!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HH - &lt;i&gt;How many kids out there are selling a one time $5 crack deal vs. larger kids making hundreds and hundreds of dollars in crack deals?&lt;/i&gt;

The vast majority earn VERY little. Research has shown that they probably earn less than minimum wage. See here for more information - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UGC2nLnaes

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;I can&#039;t stop Mexico deciding to make drugs legal in Mexico. Well, we&#039;re not without our influence. We supply most of their demand. If we make drugs illegal, it stands to reason less Mexicans will be murdered by the drug trade. Would you prefer that more Mexicans die, so that we can preserve our virtue? 

(Of course, the Mexicans should probably legalize it too!)

&#062;A society that enjoys taking mind warping drugs freely (hypothetically) is not a society I believe you can depend on.

Here is where I want you to dig deeper. In what sense can you not depend on it? Do you think that pilots will fly jumbo jets while high (ha ha pun!)? Will the president be hopped up on acid while negotiating on the White House  jumbotron with supervillains? Will people drive intoxicated? Will teachers sell drugs to their classes? 

Why would any of this stuff happen? What exactly, are you afraid of?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Shouldn&#039;t people actually dying in Mexico outweigh the &quot;diminshing of &#039;virtue&#039;&quot; in this country

I can&#039;t stop Mexico deciding to make drugs legal in Mexico. 

&#062;Whats is the terrible thing you are foreseeing if the stigma of drug use diminishes, exactly?
I am not sure how to exactly respond to this. Either drugs are bad or they are good...or they are neutral and it all depends on the whim of the people at the moment. I personally do not see the later being the case. A society that enjoys taking mind warping drugs freely (hypothetically) is not a society I believe you can depend on. Not a society I believe you would want to raise your kids in. Not a wholesome society. Not a healthy one. Are these concept vague? Ya, ok. Perhaps. But nonetheless, I believe it to do be true. Feel free to pigeon hole everything I said here till I simply throw in the white towel. [I think at least on this, R&#039; Fink can back me up :P]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;But the fact that it is scary that there are murderous gangs in Mexico, does not negate what I feel will be the diminishing of virtue in THIS country with hard drugs being legal. Everyone knows murder is wrong...but after a couple of generations, will this society still feel drugs are a vice like we think of it today? 

I don&#039;t really get this line of reasoning at all. Shouldn&#039;t people actually dying in Mexico outweigh the &quot;diminshing of &#039;virtue&#039;&quot; in this country? What is this virtue you speak of, anyway? It just sounds like a very vague sort of concern. You don&#039;t want to legalize drugs, because then people will use them. If people use them, then they won&#039;t look so bad. And so? Whats is the terrible thing you are foreseeing if the stigma of drug use diminishes, exactly? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Really? You think the kid that sells $5 of crack should be imprisoned automatically? Please realize that jails are &quot;college&quot; for criminals, and prisons are &quot;graduate school&quot;. Just a few months inside hardens you as a criminal, a few years and it&#039;s generally irreversible.
You are asking me for VERY specific circumstances. That is up for legislatures to decide HOW MUCH crack sold is merit for prison. Even the Netherlands imprisons illegal drug selling. How many kids out there are selling a one time $5 crack deal vs. larger kids making hundreds and hundreds of dollars in crack deals?

&#062;A feeling??? We have proof that making them illegal is pretty darn bad. Doesn&#039;t proof trump feeling at least in the decision-making process?

Proof of what? You have proof the sentencing structure does not work for drug use. You have proof that a lot of money is used for the war on drugs. You don&#039;t have proof of what might happen if hard drugs are legalized. You don&#039;t  have proof of how much money the government will eventually put up (and you know it WILL happen, because the people are going to demand the government get involved) for medical costs and further addiction prevention. You are getting rid of one problem, but lets not be naive here....we will just be inheriting another problem. One can argue one problem is preferable to another. But proof? How much proof can you have to something that has not been done yet and the affect it will have on society. 

&#062;So do you also support making alcohol and smoking illegal? 

Not at all. I think there is rather a hysteria on the left to second-hand smoke. People can drink and smoke without getting mind- $#k

&#062;Again, it&#039;s too late at that point. They are career criminals by then. And even shorter sentences encourage further crime.

That is basically an argument not to imprison anyone then. Hence my point: Someone that was found snorking coke at a party....should he spend time in jail????

		<description><![CDATA[HH - &lt;i&gt;Sellers should be imprisoned. Simple enough. &lt;/i&gt;

Really? You think the kid that sells $5 of crack should be imprisoned automatically? Please realize that jails are &quot;college&quot; for criminals, and prisons are &quot;graduate school&quot;. Just a few months inside hardens you as a criminal, a few years and it&#039;s generally irreversible.

&lt;i&gt;Could be. I have a feeling that legalizing hard drugs would be much worse that drinking and smoking.&lt;/i&gt;

A feeling??? We have &lt;b&gt;proof&lt;/b&gt; that making them illegal is pretty darn bad. Doesn&#039;t proof trump feeling at least in the decision-making process?

Also, you qualifying the statement. What exactly do you mean by &quot;hard drugs&quot;? As mentioned earlier, pot use is already close to decriminalized (in terms of actually being sentenced).

&lt;i&gt;IMO, I think society at large will be victims of having LSD, Crack, Speed publicly and easily accessible, plastered on billboards, bartender serving it to you along with your tequila and in homes with children.  &lt;/i&gt;

So do you also support making alcohol and smoking illegal?

&lt;i&gt;See what people are sitting decades in prisons for and see if the punishment is really fitting the crime.&lt;/i&gt;

Again, it&#039;s too late at that point. They are career criminals by then. And even shorter sentences encourage further crime.]]></description>

<p>Again, it&#8217;s too late at that point. They are career criminals by then. And even shorter sentences encourage further crime.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Already done to a great extent. Probably 30 or 40 million people have smoked pot and the vast majority of them have never been to prison. What about the kid that uses crack once in a while? What about a &quot;runner&quot;? What about the kid that delivers it for 5 bucks? What about the lookout on the corner that gets $20 a day?
Sellers should be imprisoned. Simple enough. 

&#062;I don&#039;t know, but it is quite likely that society will look upon it as a vice just as they look upon smoking and drinking as vices today. Heck, we even call them &quot;sin&quot; taxes nowadays! :-)

Could be. I have a feeling that legalizing hard drugs would be much worse that drinking and smoking.

&#062;Nope, not &quot;anything&quot;, just those things that are &quot;victimless&quot;.

IMO, I think society at large will be victims of having LSD, Crack, Speed publicly and easily accessible, plastered on billboards, bartender serving it to you along with your tequila and in homes with children.  

&#062;Please elaborate.

Nothing to elaborate on. See what people are sitting decades in prisons for and see if the punishment is really fitting the crime. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;More scary than a whole generation (actually two almost three already) of inner city youth growing up with complete disdain for the cops and by extension just about any authority (other than the local drug heavy)?

This comment needs to be researched some more. I don&#039;t know how much of an extant it is true...and if it is...for what reasons. I went to an LAPD orientation and one of the things that was talked about was how much better things have gotten in many of the minority communities and how they work to keep it that way. One of the big problems was the rampart scandal that was not solely centered around drugs. Fake drug arrests was not the reason people grew suspicious of the cops after that scandal. 

There are bad people in these communities that by their nature are going to have disdain for the police. There are gangs and pimps on the streets.

So the argument that people are going to have disdain for authority is not an argument in of itself to legalize hard drugs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; E. Fink - &lt;i&gt;It is oversimplifying it. But it is almost entirely accurate.&lt;/i&gt;
But mostly &quot;accurate&quot; due to socioeconomic status (which correlates well with skin shade).

&lt;i&gt;Your version of the drug policy is wrong. A more accurate version is: If the neighborhood has a lot of crime, people who have drugs on them will be arrested.&lt;/i&gt; 
Yes. That&#039;s a good way to put it. And it proves the point you are making in the post. We &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; care about the crime, not so much about the drugs.
&lt;i&gt;You are quite misinformed if you think most drug arrests are about burglary, assault or robbery. That is not the case. Not at all. If you rob or assault someone you will be charged with those crimes, not drug charges.&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;m sorry I wasn&#039;t more clear in my previous comment. I KNOW that most drug arrests are purely about drugs, but mainly (as you say above) in places where it is typical for the money used to purchase those drugs to have come from criminal activity.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;More scary than having 2 million people in prison getting an excellent education about how to be hard criminals and large numbers about to be released into society due to massive state budget deficits?
I made it quite clear that the sentencing system needs to be reformed. Someone that has smoked pot does not need to sit in prison

&#062;More scary than a whole neighboring county almost being taken over by drug cartels?

That&#039;s also scary, of course. But the fact that it is scary that there are murderous gangs in Mexico, does not negate what I feel will be the diminishing of virtue in THIS country with hard drugs being legal. Everyone knows murder is wrong...but after a couple of generations, will this society still feel drugs are a vice like we think of it today? Which battle will be easier to wage? I realize this is more of a meta explanation, but I feel it is also important. 

&#062;More scary than a whole generation (actually two almost three already) of inner city youth growing up with complete disdain for the cops and by extension just about any authority (other than the local drug heavy)?

Well great. Let&#039;s just make anything legal in order for people not to have disdain for the police. Putting drugs aside, people will naturally have disdain for any authority figure that tells them what they are doing is wrong. 

&#062;More scary than lack of reasonable and timely access to justice due to our court systems clogged up with drug crime?

See my first comment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; E. Fink - &lt;i&gt;If they were caucasion they had nothing to worry about...&lt;/i&gt;

That&#039;s way oversimplifying it. It mostly depend son socioeconomic level. The poor caucasians in Appalachia (and elsewhere) are treated similarly.

Basically (obviously not entirely, but more or less), the policy boils down to:
* If you have money and you buy drugs with it, use it in a mostly responsible manner (i.e. don&#039;t cause harm to others), we won&#039;t vigorously pursue you.
* If you don&#039;t have money, you burgle stuff or bash people on the head to rob them to get money for drugs, we will vigorously pursue you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Regarding the casinos, it&#039;s my understanding, at least from the Godfather, that moving into legal gambling was part of their plan to go legit! ;)

How well did that go? :)

&#062;Regarding the alcohol comparison, I&#039;m not sure what you want. I&#039;m guessing you think that hard drugs should at least be as regulated as alcohol? That&#039;s fine with me, because I think the relevant concern the state should have is the damage done to others. Insofar as public intoxication is a menace to the public, it should be prohibited. 

&#062;If a bar wants to sell hard drugs, let them do just that - I just hope they have the necessary insurance. I see very little public policy reason to support a liquor license regime - licenses are, almost by definition, little more than artificial barriers to entry put in place by incumbents. 

&#062;If we think being able to enjoy narcotics in a public place is dangerous to others, then forbid it. I just want to see those findings.

&#062;I don&#039;t have a problem, in principle, with crack being advertised. Give them all the restrictions you give to marketing alcohol and tobacco to children.

Exactly. That&#039;s my point. It would be contrary to what R&#039; Fink suggested that it would stay only within the confines of ones home. And personally, all these things that you agreed with me, scary me for it to become a reality. 


PS- Why is sometimes I see a &quot;reply&quot; button, and sometimes I don&#039;t?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Regarding the mob, if organized crime wants to, it&#039;s free to invest its resources in the labradoodle market. It just wouldn&#039;t be very lucrative, because labradoodles can be traded (relatively) freely. Curse you American Kennel Club! The mob used to control alcohol, but with the demise of prohibition that is no longer the case, unless they&#039;re much more sophisiticated than previously thought. Organized crime thrives on a black market, where wronged consumers have no leverage or legal recourse, because contracts are unenforceable, and where any of the conduct involved is illegal, so the effective &quot;law&quot; is set by the cartel, which has little disincentive to resort to correspondingly extrajudicial remedies to enforce its rights. I&#039;m not arguing that Mexican drug cartels will disappear overnight, or that we can end organized crime in one fell swoop, but this would be a huge blow. Regarding the casinos, it&#039;s my understanding, at least from the Godfather, that moving into legal gambling was part of their plan to go legit! ;)

Regarding the alcohol comparison, I&#039;m not sure what you want. I&#039;m guessing you think that hard drugs should at least be as regulated as alcohol? That&#039;s fine with me, because I think the relevant concern the state should have is the damage done to others. Insofar as public intoxication is a menace to the public, it should be prohibited. 

If a bar wants to sell hard drugs, let them do just that - I just hope they have the necessary insurance. I see very little public policy reason to support a liquor license regime - licenses are, almost by definition, little more than artificial barriers to entry put in place by incumbents. 

If we think being able to enjoy narcotics in a public place is dangerous to others, then forbid it. I just want to see those findings.

I don&#039;t have a problem, in principle, with crack being advertised. Give them all the restrictions you give to marketing alcohol and tobacco to children.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have time to read all the comments right now, but after a quick perusal, it looks like there are some excellent ones.

But arguing about what might happen if drugs are legalized seems to me to be besides the point. That&#039;s because we &lt;b&gt;already know&lt;/b&gt; what will happen if they are not legal and it isn&#039;t good. The facts are that most people who want drugs find a way to acquire them, and that huge illegal enterprises have grown around drugs. Furthermore, these illegal enterprises cause all sorts of secondary (murder, intimidation, etc) and tertiary (petty theft to get $ for next hit) crimes as they operate their businesses.

We &lt;b&gt;KNOW&lt;/b&gt; that our current policy doesn&#039;t work at all. We have 2 million people imprisoned, mostly based on drug charges (or secondary or tertiary crimes related to drugs). That&#039;s a heck of lot more than any other western country in the world. And most of those other countries seem to do just fine without locking up anyone using or selling drugs. Not just fine, but they appear to have lower crime rates than we do.

So it&#039;s time to try a different policy. Let&#039;s see if it works better for us. And there is precedent, we outlawed alcohol for a while, and then determined that it didn&#039;t work very well, so changed our laws and made it legal again with reasonable regulation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So two things:

1) I don&#039;t believe any of the large cartels in Columbia and Mexico are going to go down without a fight. The mob still controlled all of vegas when alcohol and gambling were perfectly legal. I believe they will evolve. 
2) If alcohol is used as a comparison to drugs, well then, why on earth would it be regulated ONLY to the home as R&#039; Fink suggests? Alcohol is certainly not regulated only the privacy of the home. The only thing that is regulated is public intoxication. Meaning, there is no reason that if hard drugs are legalized, you won&#039;t see &quot;Happy Hours&quot; at bars or night clubs selling LSD. In the same way a restaurant applies for an alcohol license, why shouldn&#039;t they be able to apply for a hard drug license where they can sell Speed to anyone over 21? If Alcohol (and even cigarettes) are allowed advertising rights on billboards for example...what rational is there for outlawing Crack to be advertised?

Mind you, I am very libertarian when it comes to Nanny State issues. I am against chocking (no pun intended) anti-cigaratte laws. But when it comes to hard drugs, I personally set a line. I believe there should be a distinction between hard drugs and soft drugs. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, okay, on one level, I would agree with you, obviously, that the sentencing regime is ridiculous, and if possible, it should be drastically reduced, but I don&#039;t see that bill passing any Congress in this dimension, for much the same reason that no legislature will take up the cause of the cruelly and unusually stored/packaged/punished inmates in the California penal system (or pretty much every American penal system). I understand I&#039;m probably delusional, but I think for reform to happen, it has to be more of the complete 180 of what we&#039;re doing now. It has to be packaged as a sort of libertarian/populist thing; we seem to be on one of those kicks at the moment. Or, if compromise is in the future, better we start with me and compromise around your position, then start from you and compromise somewhere else.

But substantively, I would argue that government should largely get out of the drug game. I&#039;m not a libertarian by any means, but this is the classic case of government trying and trying and spending and spending on a solution to a problem, and literally making it worse. I&#039;m just not sure what the point is in attempting to continue this farce - in any guise. I know you want there to be a social stigma attached to the use of drugs, but I think the coercion of the state should not really be used for that purpose - it&#039;s a mighty heavy cudgel, and I&#039;m not sure it&#039;s either necessary or desirable. 

We know drugs are bad for people, just like alcohol and tobacco is bad for people. If someone really doesn&#039;t care about killing himself slowly but pleasurably with drugs, let him do drugs. What do I care? It&#039;s not my job to punish morons so I can feel morally superior. The coercive power of the state is a great and terrible (and expensive!) thing, and shouldn&#039;t be wasted on finger-wagging. It should be used to protect people from the dangerous behavior of others, not themselves. I&#039;m perfectly happy with a regime that criminalizes and punishes driving under the influence of these things, or makes it a crime to sell them near schools - in these cases the potential for harm to non-consenting others is clear. But people should die, so I can have society make a statement to my kids? Mexico and Colombia should sink into the sea rather than me doing my job as a parent? That seems like overkill. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[    It takes courage to oppose drug prohibition, when many people still equate ending prohibition with being &quot;for&quot; drug use. I have long felt that the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; was a failed policy, having read Dr. Thomas Szasz&#039;s views over 25 years ago.  Unfortunately, few people want to go on the record for fear of being seen as being &quot;soft on drugs.&quot; The laws of economics being what they are, trying to constrict the supply of drugs only enriches the profits of drug dealers. Meanwhile, law-abiding citizens are deprived of access to cold medicine.  As the NRA would say about guns, drugs don&#039;t kill people; people who use drugs kill people.  A rational approach to drugs goes after the demand for drugs, which is what religion is supposed to do, rather than the supply of drugs, which only seems to cause more problems.

    To quote Dr. Szasz on this issue:  If the grown son of a devoutly religious Jewish father has a ham sandwich for lunch, the father cannot use the police power of American society to impose his moral views on his son.  But if the grown son of a devoutly alcoholic father has heroin for lunch, the father can, indeed, use the police power of American society to impose his moral views on his son.  Moreover, the penalty that the father could legally visit on his son might exceed the penalty that would be imposed on his son for killing his mother.  It is that moral calculus--refracted through our present differential treatment of those who literally abuse others by killing, maiming, and robbing them against those who ... abuse themselves by using illicit chemicals--which reveals which reveals the depravity into which our preoccupation with drugs and drug controls has led us.

   To be sure, as others have commented, ending drug prohibition is not without some risk.  We would need to sustain and even enhance the social stigma against recreational drug use, especially hard drugs.  But we all know what doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is.  Time to try something different, and at least debate this respectfully and openly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good comment Vox, but from what I am understanding, is that your problem (as well as R&#039; Fink&#039;s basic problem) is not that its illegal....but the punishment vetted out is too extreme for a drug use. Like I said before, I don&#039;t think someone should be sitting in prison for smoking some joints. What can be done is reforming the sentencing, and not necessarily making hard drugs perfectly legal. ]]></description>
