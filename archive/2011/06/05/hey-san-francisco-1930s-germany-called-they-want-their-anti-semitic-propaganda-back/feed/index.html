		<description><![CDATA[All of these comments make one believe that there is nothing more to Judaism than a worship of circumcision. Circumcision, unfortunately has become a graven image, which is worshiped in place of G-d. Worship of circumcision is a clear violation of the Second Commandment.

It is quite sad to realize that Judaism has nothing to offer but worship of circumcision, so any attempt to ban circumcision puts Judaism in danger of total elimination.

Perhaps it is for this reason that Judaism maintains special religious officials called mohels, whose only function is to cut physiologically functional body parts off of baby boys. Such an action is monstrous by any objective evaluation. Surely that is the reason that the comic depicted a so-called &quot;Monster Mohel.&quot;

One might think it is time for Judaism to clean up its act and to commence protection of the human rights of its sons.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with your first three paragraphs.

The problem with your fourth paragraph is that it devalues religious practice from obligation to ritual. Perhaps I &quot;over spoke&quot; by saying that anti-circumcision means religion is silly or backwards. In truth, it just means that religion is not to taken seriously as a value system. Believe me, I completely understand that position for a person who is not religious. The imposition of that position is what turns that position into an anti-religion position in my opinion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to agree that the comic misrepresents and derides Jews, making it indeed anti-Semitic. As someone who is deeply concerned about the ethical implications of circumcision, I also feel that it trivializes the much more nuanced aspects of this cultural and religious practice.

In my experience, the vast majority of the &quot;intactivist&quot; community is NOT motivated by any kind of general negativity or lack of respect for Jews. It is made up of, in large part, by individuals who became aware of this issue through their own parenthood, men who object to having undergone the surgery, and, as you probably know, there are many Jews involved. The bulk of the personal frustration is aimed at the perceived lack of ethical responsibility on the part of the medical profession, and lack of fair representation in media and other formal channels.

Like you suggested, I believe this imagery to be the product of one person&#039;s fantasy run amok, and my hope is that the leadership behind the SF legislation will take a strong stand to distance itself from the comic and its creator. Mr. Hess should issue a formal apology, retract the comic, and perhaps resign from any leadership roles he may hold within the lobbying effort.

As far as yours and Rabbi Alderstein&#039;s assertion that, the genital-integrity rights argument fundamentally invalidates religious belief, I strongly disagree. Furthermore, I don&#039;t believe that very many people take this position. The conflict arises not from the idea that all or any religious precepts are &quot;silly&quot;, &quot;backwards&quot;, or &quot;ridiculous&quot;, but from the moral and ethical objection to imposing those beliefs onto a third person, in a way that endangers him and also prevents him from consensual participation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I condemn Foreskin Man. I do not support the San Francisco and Santa Monica ballot initiatives, mainly because they are silly grandstanding that will accomplish nothing.

Above you wrote as follows: &quot;...the battle against circumcision is in essence a battle against religion.
 I don’t agree with every word of Rabbi Adlerstein’s essays but the fact
 remains that the reason Intactivists exist is because they believe 
religion is a myth. They believe that following the precepts of the 
Torah, New Testament, Quran or any other religious text that claims to 
be the word of God is backwards and ridiculous. By extension, any 
religious practice based on the words of these religious texts is 
similar to taking instruction from a fairy tale...&quot;

Rabbi, you are sadly mistaken. Intactivism in San Francisco and Santa Monica may have a strong secular and New Age flavor. And there is no reason for ritual circumcision to find favor with atheists, agnostics, and neopagans. But many intactivists around North America are committed Christians, and some are even frum Jews. The brunt of the indignation felt by these disparate intactivists are the millions of circumcisions performed on gentile boys within 48 hours of their birth. These circumcisions are often performed simply because parents fear that if they do not have it done, a son will be bullied by other boys and be rejected as a sexual partner by women when he becomes an adult. There is also a widespread unspoken fear that a natural penis is evidence that its owner was born to poor and uneducated parents.

While Christ did not speak to circumcision, it is a blunt truth that the author of Acts did, as did Saul of Tarsus, the rabbi&#039;s son better know as Paul. And they firmly denied that circumcision can have any religious or moral significance. In this respect, Christianity and Bahai stand firmly apart from the two other Abrahamic faiths, Judaism and Islam. The Koran, BTW, is utterly silent about any obligation to circumcise, and a handful of Moslems have begun highlighting that fact.

Many Jewish family lines outside of North America and Israel no longer circumcise, but also do not put that fact in the public domain.

		<description><![CDATA[The tacit, and often explicit, assumption of many favoring the 
outlawing of infant circumcision is that the procedure reduces the 
quality of the sex life of the child when he becomes an adult.  Of 
course, none of the men participating in this conversation have offered a
 personal before/after comparison.  Most circumcised American men were 
circumcised as infants, and cannot report on sexual experience with a 
foreskin present.  Similarly, uncircumcised men cannot report on sexual 
experience without a foreskin.  Wild claims, and quoting of medical 
society political positions (which are quite different from clinical 
research!) are no substitute for properly controlled clinical trials.


Fortunately, such clinical trials exist.  In the last few years, 
there have been campaigns to circumcise consenting adult men in Africa 
to reduce the risk of AIDS.  At least one of the trials did a before/after comparison of sexual satisfaction for the men undergoing circumcision.  All the men entering the clinical trial were sexually active. The trial randomly assigned about 2700 men to either 
be circumcised immediately, or after two years of observation.  So–and 
this is important–both groups consisted entirely of men who consented to
 circumcision for themselves.  That removes the bias that might have 
occurred were the groups composed of men with different attitudes toward
 circumcision.  


The researchers asked the study participants to rate sexual function 
and satisfaction at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after randomization. 
 For the circumcision and control groups, respectively, rates of any 
reported sexual dysfunction decreased from 24% and 26% at baseline 
to 6.2% and 5.8% at month 24. Changes over time were not associated with
 circumcision status. Compared to before they were circumcised, 64% of
 circumcised men reported their penis was “much more sensitive,” and 
55% rated their ease of reaching orgasm as “much more” at month 24.  
The researchers concluded that adult male circumcision was not

If the question of infant circumcision were a strictly rational argument, this lack of evidence of 
the main harmed alleged to be a consequence of circumcision would 
quickly drain the passion from it.  Then proponents and opponents of 
infant circumcision would have to compare the small benefits of the 
procedure (reduced risk of HIV, reduced risk of penile cancer, reduced 
risk of urinary tract infection, eliminated risk of phimosis and 
paraphimosis) with the small risks of the procedure (small risk of 
infection, small risk of bleeding, small duration of pain-related 
behavior).  A rational discussion would end up pretty much where society
 is now:  the evidence doesn’t point strongly either way, so it should 
be up to the parents to decide.  The passion and inflammatory language 
(“mutilation” “amputation” “blood ritual”) reveal that this is not a 
rational argument about an elective procedure; people don’t feel this 
strongly about ear-piercing of little girls.  Rather this argument has 
become the vehicle through which passions, angers, and unresolved 
conflicts concerning religion, sexuality, and parental authority are 
expressed.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tacit, and often explicit, assumption of many favoring the<br />
outlawing of infant circumcision is that the procedure reduces the<br />
quality of the sex life of the child when he becomes an adult.  Of<br />
course, none of the men participating in this conversation have offered a<br />
 personal before/after comparison.  Most circumcised American men were<br />
circumcised as infants, and cannot report on sexual experience with a<br />
foreskin present.  Similarly, uncircumcised men cannot report on sexual<br />
experience without a foreskin.  Wild claims, and quoting of medical<br />
society political positions (which are quite different from clinical<br />
research!) are no substitute for properly controlled clinical trials.</p>
<p>Fortunately, such clinical trials exist.  In the last few years,<br />
there have been campaigns to circumcise consenting adult men in Africa<br />
to reduce the risk of AIDS.  At least one of the trials did a before/after comparison of sexual satisfaction for the men undergoing circumcision.  All the men entering the clinical trial were sexually active. The trial randomly assigned about 2700 men to either<br />
be circumcised immediately, or after two years of observation.  So–and<br />
this is important–both groups consisted entirely of men who consented to<br />
 circumcision for themselves.  That removes the bias that might have<br />
occurred were the groups composed of men with different attitudes toward<br />
 circumcision.  </p>
<p>The researchers asked the study participants to rate sexual function<br />
and satisfaction at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after randomization.<br />
 For the circumcision and control groups, respectively, rates of any<br />
reported sexual dysfunction decreased from 24% and 26% at baseline<br />
to 6.2% and 5.8% at month 24. Changes over time were not associated with<br />
 circumcision status. Compared to before they were circumcised, 64% of<br />
 circumcised men reported their penis was “much more sensitive,” and<br />
55% rated their ease of reaching orgasm as “much more” at month 24.<br />
The researchers concluded that adult male circumcision was not<br />
associated with sexual dysfunction. Circumcised men reported increased<br />
penile sensitivity and enhanced ease of reaching orgasm. </p>
