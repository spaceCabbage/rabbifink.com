		<description><![CDATA[Women once had positions of power. I was with a archaeology class in northern Israel, where I was touring a second temple synagogue when the teacher pointed out the part of the mosiac the declared the leader of the congregation a wealthy women he explained that her position was something like a modern day rabbi. Which shocked much of the flass he pointed out another synagogue in now modern day Syria that had similar mosiac. He held the position that separating men and women as jews currently do is a roman tradition we picked up from idol worshipping women hating homocentric roman friends. The first temple, and the temple under the hasmoneons had no separate womens court, only a peoples court where men and women worshiped together equally. It was herod, educated in rome that built the first Jewish structure that separated men and women. Before him and even for some time after him, women worshiped equally to men and held community positions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The fly in the ointment is heterodoxy. Look over the history of halacha and you seen constant slow but progressive evolution in response to social changes and new norms.  All this ends with the rise of the Reformers in Germany and the backlash by the Chasam Sofer.  Now any change is problematic because there is a risk, from the Chareidi side, of having the Reformers say &quot;Aha!  We made that change already, so this means we&#039;ve been right all along!&quot;
It like why in politics no one in the government ever acts on any good suggestions that the opposition makes.  Same thing here: change means the Reform are right and we can never admit that!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you would have read the article you might have learned more about the subject than you could have possibly gleaned by zipping though it in a daf yomi cycle. As I wrote in the post, the article proves that it is within the confines of accepted orthodox halacha for women to become highly educated in matters of Torah and take positions of authority and religious leadership. It is wrong for you to &quot;call me out&quot; as you have when I am merely asserting an well established halachic position which you would know if you would, you know, ACTUALLY READ the article.

I don&#039;t know you DovBear is and I don&#039;t care. But yes, plenty of people ask me about the dissenters on this blog and they may venture guesses as to who they are. So there you go.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The only reason that the &quot;Gay orthodox Rabbi&quot; is wrong is because the oral Torah tells us how to interpret that verse of mishkvei isha. It is not open to interpretation since the Rabbis of the talmud said otherwise. Frankly - i am speaking aobut what you have written, not Hakira, and i have made no comment about that publication. to say that i am not educated is silly. I am a learned Jew, I have been through several daf yomi cycles, (this is my 3rd that I will complete) and have spent a large portion of my life studying Torah. Not reading a specific Hakira article hardly make me unlearned on a topic. I don&#039;t care about that article. Im talking about your posts. 

As for me saying that &quot;many of us are thinking this,&quot; i only know that from the people who i have spoken to. I fail to see how your &quot;many of us think we know who you are&quot; is any more defensible. And who is us? do you actually have a group of people who you sit around with trying to figure out who your anonymous commenters are? Tell me who Dov Bear is, and then i will tell you who I am. what the hel*?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did you even bother reading the article in Hakirah? No precedent? Arguing with the rabbis? Educate yourself before you make statements like those.

There are no &quot;next steps&quot;. Every issue is an issue unto itself.

Do you realize how disingenuous you are being by comparing one man d&#039;amar in a mishna to a PASSUK IN THE TORAH?!

Finally, you have to realize that when an anonymous (supposedly at least, a few people think we know who you are) says &quot;this is what a great many of us are thinking&quot; you have absolutely zero credibility. For now, your questions and ideas are (somewhat) interesting to discuss, but invoking the opinions of a &quot;great many&quot; anonymous people is absolutely meaningless to me. You might as well tell me that you spoke to GD Himself and He agrees with you too...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,
If you are willing to disagree with halacha and Rabbi&#039;s of the tlamud on something like this, with no precedent, I fail to see why the next stpe is not your supporting same sex marriage. After all, you can  surely call it &quot;not fair,&quot; isn;t that right? And you can also read the verse about &quot;as one lies with a woman&quot; differently than the rabbis of the talmud. Why not? why can&#039;t readers of your blog just take that same next logical step, even if you don&#039;t? why can&#039;t they say &quot;its perfectly understandable that at that time, rabbis would think this. but now things are different!&quot; why not? please clarify this. you have to udnerstand that this is what a great many of us are thinking. Dov Bear, feel free to pipe in on this one too if you have any insights (not! This question is directed to Rabbi Fink,)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you realize I am perfectly capable of  giving the Cohen blessing from the pulpit????? But yet, I am not allowed. Is that an injustice???

I think the problem is, the left has nearly successfully equated &quot;equality of outcome with justice.&quot; Justice is about law treating everyone as equal. Not favoring one side over the other. 

This is simply not the same in religion (or any other private club) when there are other rules and rituals at play. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do Orthodox women want to be &quot;liberated&quot; ?  Do they want to obligate themselves to go to a minyan three times a day for prayer?  Must we burden them with tzitzit and tefillin?  There is a very good reason why women are exempt from time-bound positive laws - it&#039;s very very hard to raise children and run a household if you need to be concerned about making it to minchah on time!

That said - Orthodox women are already free to choose their own lives.  They can marry if they wish, but they are not obligated to do so.  They can (and do) receive advanced degrees from fine universities, and work in all sectors.  An Orthodox woman can make her own choices, make her own money, live her own life - all within halacha.

It seems that the liberal Jews are much more concerned about frum female &quot;liberation&quot; than are the frum females.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m very mesupak on this. It will certainly be interesting to look back on in 50 years (I&#039;ll be looking forward to your post then;)).
We have an American post-1960&#039;s attitude that&#039;s causing some friction. I wonder if it&#039;s enough to cause change though. Enough women are following the mainstream path that dissenters are cast aside. The issue is the same with everything that cant be legally changed. Evolution discussions, going to college, this is no different.
Even in the secular world, there was a survey done (I forget where) that most women dont rise as high in the corporate ladder as men because they aren&#039;t as committed to &#039;just business&#039;. They want kids as well. 

This might not be a problem there for the women that do want to go into business because there&#039;s space to do it if you want to. In the frum world though, there&#039;s one rule. The rabbonim make the rules, and everybody sticks with the tzibbur or is outside. This may be necessary to keep the religion intact, but it doesn&#039;t allow for individualized halachos. 
The upshot is that even if some women start to learn and argue halacha, the establishment is not going to take them seriously. In fact, there have always been yechidos who have been bona fide talmidei chachamim, and they&#039;ve made no dent.

The only difference we have today is the modern orthodox movement. They are walking a tightrope, but if they can create places for women to learn and get involved in a rabbinically monitored environment, and keep publishing good stuff, while not openly saying they&#039;re trying to change anything, the mainstream frum world will take notice and start the gears of change moving. ]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m very mesupak on this. It will certainly be interesting to look back on in 50 years (I&#8217;ll be looking forward to your post then;)).<br />
We have an American post-1960&#8217;s attitude that&#8217;s causing some friction. I wonder if it&#8217;s enough to cause change though. Enough women are following the mainstream path that dissenters are cast aside. The issue is the same with everything that cant be legally changed. Evolution discussions, going to college, this is no different.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Like so many things in this world, I think this issue demonstrates a beautiful natural harmony that inheres in God&#039;s world.  Female talmidei chachamim and poskim will only have halachic legitimacy is they come to be accepted by the Jewish community.  They will only come to be accepted if they - the sincere ones acting l&#039;sheim shamayim - sit quietly, study, write, and grow into Torah scholars within their own 4 amos, without pushing this development on the klal.  It will be those who conduct themselves with true tznius who will pave the way for the gradual acceptence of female Torah leadership.  The ones that act brazenly, that try to push change on the klal from above instead of allowing it to develop from below will find themselves marginalized and deletimized.  It is the women that should be leaders who will pave the way for leadership, while those who are demogogues in disguise will never gain acceptance as legitimate leaders in the halachic community.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;The photo is fair. It&#039;s about men unjustly dictating what women are or are not allowed do, despite their capabilities.  It is men, not God, refusing to let women take full leadership roles in Judaism.
If its a matter of justice (as DB would say) what difference would it be if God said so? It would still be unjust. Point is, this is not an issue of justice. That is why the picture does not fit. In my opinion, it actually diminishes what women back then were actually fighting for. ]]></description>
