		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for responding, but I find the above offensive. Basically, it&#039;s the kind of sexism that I&#039;ve seen all over the orthodox community. And of course orthodox Judaism will never fully accept a non-observant lifestyle. That life does not exist within Tanach or the Mishna because all Judaic texts operate under the assumption that Judaism is undoubtedly, unquestionably correct. Therefore, a life outside of the bounds of halacha is automatically disapproved of.

However, I find it mildly hilarious the way that all modern Judeo-Christian people have been talking their way out of Leviticus, talking their way out of anything that requires a stoning or burning at the stake, and yet cannot accept a life that doesn&#039;t abide by the rules of the Torah. Orthodox Jews don&#039;t even abide by the rules of the Torah! I guess to me, it feels like a black hat calling the kettle black.

My dad reads your blog and struggles with his observance of Orthodox Judaism. He linked me to this article because he found it interesting. Here&#039;s a man who has sacrificed his life to supporting his chronically ill ex-wife and her two children, splitting his salary with her and for many years serving as her caretaker, and he thinks he bad seats in Olam Habah. How dare the Jewish community think that because they don&#039;t use electricity once a week they are automatically equal or greater than him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, welcome and thanks for commenting.

I don&#039;t think I said what you think I said.

What I said (and what I meant) was that of all the personality types, the most difficult personality to conform to orthodox Judaism (especially for women) is the artsy type. And I stand by that.

Yes, many other types leave as well. All I meant is that other types will likely have an easier time finding a sense of fulfillment in orthodox Judaism.

As far as condoning goes. (See: http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/condone) I think individuals, families, and friends should be as supportive as possible to those who are no longer observant. However, I don&#039;t think or expect that institutionally orthodox Judaism can fully approve of a non-observant lifestyle.



Thanks for stopping by. Come around again...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it is extremely condescending and inaccurate to say that most people who break from the (Orthodox) Jewish faith are &quot;artsy,&quot; creative types. It&#039;s only one step up from saying that all people who break from Judaism are &quot;unruly, rebellious types.&quot; 


There are plenty of other &quot;kinds&quot; of Jews who could easily make the same decisions as a non-observant &quot;artsy&quot; Jew. A Jew who falls in love with science and suddenly questions the ability of the Torah to explain the basic phenomena of the universe. A Jew who discovers philosophy and finds the existence of God highly unlikely. A Jew who wants to marry a non-jew and questions why the Torah forbids her not to for the (eerie) purpose of &quot;preserving the race.&quot;


The kids who leave Judaism are the same as the kids that leave Catholicism, Hinduism, Islam, etc. They&#039;re all people who have risen about religious dogma and found an alternative truth. The only difference between non-practicing Jews and other people who abandon their religion is that Judaism encourages curiosity and questioning. It almost seems that HaShem gave his chosen people the very means with which to abandon his commandments by embedding these traits in their collective identity.


Sincerely,
A Non-Practicing &quot;Artsy&quot; Jewish Girl]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the film is well done.and I think your comments are on target.On  a series note the joke about &quot;i am one of 8- not a bad statistic&quot; made me very sad because no matter how many children you have ( we  have 9) each is a precious gem .
.. on a sillier but real note, when I was in High School and not yet observant, I recall that I didn&#039;t want to date the Conservative  Rabbi&#039;s daughter only because I thought it would be weird and disrespectful to kiss the daughter of a Rabbi ( i am not sure if this turned out to be my loss orher  loss... ha ha) but Yes.. being the child of a Rabbi or public figure can be daunting.]]></description>

Eliyahu, our alma matter&#039;s namesake had a son who was an artist is the Village. I can email you details if interested at all. Another great american leader had twin granddaughters who arent orthodox.

		<description><![CDATA[In my travels I&#039;ve met or learned of Rabbi&#039;s children or grandchildren who have decided that Orthodoxy is not the life they want. (there is nothing I hate more than the expression &quot;off the derech&quot; it is so condescending and strips the individual of his or her right to live a life chosen, based on any myriad of reasons.) Most prominently perhaps was a descendant of r Aron kotler, although when I knew him he wasnt completely there yet. The rabbi of my youthhood shul&#039;s daughter was not Orthodox (and the granddaughter of a famouse Orthodox leader) and I recall her husband being in shul and getting an Aliya one shabbos and he could barely get the hebrew words out. Needless to say the Rabbi was terribly embarrassed  but I think it is commendable that he didnt disown them but they were apparently still apart of the family.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mesmerizing film. It has aesthetic value no lesser, than religious. So much of simple beauty. All  Rabbis/fathers love their doughters, and that is a backbone of the mutual respect, regardless wether the daughters exit the faith or not. Confronting fathers, daughters tasting themselves for a hidden power to question absoluts of the ortodox Judaism. But isn&#039;t Tora teaching us to think differently? One of the daughters says: &quot;Nobody ever told me whether God exists over and above society&#039;s need for him&quot;. When children(particulary daughters) at their face question their fathers - they seek to exibit their own uniqness. At the end one of the daughters wonders:&quot;I like to imagine that. after we die and become only our souls. that I&#039;ll meet my Dad and we&#039;ll have only &quot;Daddyness between us&quot; without strain, without embarassement, and with just the most essential feelings between us. I&#039;rather have my father accepted me as I am instead of trying to keep me in a framework, that i don&#039;t waqnt to be in&quot;. Needless to say that this fim is made by a women - Racheli Wasserman. Sons have different way to confront theirb fathers life, faith and power.
Very beautiful and wise work. Thanks Rabbi Fink for teasing us so masterfully.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my mind the bigger issue is a child&#039;s access to their father.  When the father is a prominent Rav the father is preoccupied with communal needs and has less time to devote to the children.   Ruth Katz tells her husband when discussing God in the sushi restaurant &quot;I wanted to hear that from him, not from you&quot;, she saying she didn&#039;t have time (or perhaps feel comfortable) to discuss these issues with her father. All three expressed a similar sentiment.  When the father is a Rav and the daughter becomes non-observant the separation between them is stark, but this is a problem all fathers in a modern hectic world have.  Children will rebel against their parents if they grow up unhappy, and every child will be unhappy if they feel they don&#039;t get the attention they need.  


Thanks for passing along, a very poignant and personal film.  ]]></description>
