		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Of course the ideal is that marriage is a lifelong commitment but the Torah acknowledges the possibility that circumstances change and that people are imperfect. That&#039;s why divorce is as much an institution as marriage is.


Isn&#039;t that what Joseph said? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How can you publicly and &quot;openly&quot; condemn a rabbi for making very ordinary points and portray him as inferior to a woman who&#039;s patently incapable of speaking with any modicum of decency, particularly when several of your points bespeak naiveté, narrow-mindedness, and are, at best, a matter of opinion?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A misrepresentation of the genuine Torah approach? I am bothered that you make this assertion SO forcefully and authoritatively when in fact it is completely wrong. Of course the ideal is that marriage is a lifelong commitment but the Torah acknowledges the possibility that circumstances change and that people are imperfect. That&#039;s why divorce is as much an institution as marriage is. Seriously Joseph, read a book or study some Gemarah before you make such erroneous assertions about Judaism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So
 Rabbi Fink, &quot;marriage isn&#039;t permanent&quot;? Hmmm. Ideally, it should be. If
 things go wrong, then there is an option of divorce, but to state that 
relationships and marriage are not permanent is a misrepresentation of 
the genuine Torah approach. They should be permanent and only can be if 
one treats the entire subject with the sensitivity to boundaries that is
 so crucial to successful relationships.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;God does not even require women to get married or have children in the Torah. Why does Rabbi Rosenblatt?


God? I think you mean rabbinic legal hoolahooping doesn&#039;t require it. Personally, that is irrelevant. Nobody says to their daughters &quot;You know, God doesn&#039;t require you to get married, so it&#039;s not really a big deal&quot;


Personally, I can&#039;t stand Sarah Silverman. Her crudeness speaks a lot about her. But, the video was about voting. Nothing more. I would like to give the rabbi a little more benefit of the doubt that he simply mean&#039;t that Sarah would be better served finding something a little more meaningful in life than what she does for a living. But it didn&#039;t need to be attached to this video.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If I may be cynical here (and if I&#039;ve got one thing from reading Orthodox media over the past years, it&#039;s taught me to be cynical), I think the thought (or non) behind this article is pretty clear:
1) Sara Silverman has committed the cardinal sin in today&#039;s right-wing Orthodox sensibility:  She is a Democrat and, even though her video is ostensibly about registering regardless of party, she CLEARLY wants to assure votes for Obama. She must be stopped!!!

2) This has absolutely nothing to do with Sara Silverman i any way shape or form.  Rabbi Rosenblatt wants to write a screed promoting the typical &quot;traditional family values&quot; that is so often flogged in this media, and Sara Silverman is a convenient celebrity whipping girl for his use.

This was not an open letter to Sara Silverman.  This was an open letter to the readers of The Jewish Press reiterating old saws about the role of a woman and her &quot;real&quot; desires and needs, and wrapping it in a package of &quot;look how superior we are to those seculars and their Democrat-voting ways!&quot; He had no intention of it ever being viewed by anyone outside the four walls of the readership of The Jewish Press, and the fact that his letter to Sara Silverman might actually have been read by Sara Silverman likely mortified him!

No great loss.  May he continue to be mortified until he eventually shuts up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You state: The funny thing about this is that the Torah does not celebrate monogamy. That was the rabbis. God has no problem with multiple spouses. Yet, clearly God has a problem with multiple Gods. It seems that the prototype does not match the production model. Oops.

My Response: Actually the prototype fits perfectly. 
1. Women can only have one husband. Men can have many wives but we have chosen to have only one on our own accord.
2. People can only believe in The One G-d. G-d can have many people but He has chosen us on His own accord.
--Also, might I add, that if this world is &quot;Feminine&quot; and God is Masculine, then the same rule of &quot;One Spouse&quot; to the female would also apply

		<description><![CDATA[This appears to be somewhat of a pattern for Rabbi Rosenblatt http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0212/letter_to_deborah_feldman.php3#.UH2r9BIr3xY

&quot;It is the alleged window into the
 Chasidic bedroom that made your book sensational.  And that is because 
there is so little about sex in the secular world that is private, 
dignified and feminine anymore.  It is all so public, aggressive and 
masculine.  When a woman is provocative she is not feminine but 
masculine, having traded relationship for sex.  Perhaps the last 
frontier of feminine dignity is in the religious bedroom.  And you 
besmirched the most wonderful, intimate experiences of a community by 
presenting your husband&#039;s non-performance and your emotional trauma as 
the norm.&quot; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here here!


Because of that article in last weeks&#039; Jewish Mess, I decided to view the YouTube video myself. I honestly didn&#039;t see anything wrong with it, nor did I see any &quot;biblical&quot; references.


I honestly wonder what Rabbi Rosenblatt&#039;s motives were in writing that letter, though I assume it was moreso to promote his own self-image as an act of Gaavah than anything else. In the process, he made himself look like a complete moron in the eyes of those that actually watched the video.


The fact that Sarah Silverman is a potty-mouth that chose to delay marriage to a point where it might be too late right now is a completely different, sadder issue that merits its own forum.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with pretty much everything you wrote, except your call for an apology. I don&#039;t think he needs to apologize any more than I think she needs to wash her mouth out with soap. He is making a judgment of her, with which you obviously (and I also) disagree. But, as he does not know her, which makes his letter ludicrous, I do not believe he said anything for which to apologize. I think it would just be best to let the entire matter rest. Your criticism is apt. The end. Also, you have a typo - &quot;archaic attitude...that somehow things&quot;. Should that be &quot;thinks&quot;?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My question:  Why can&#039;t Rabbi Rosenblatt address his comments to someone who actually cares?  Sarah for sure does not.  Congratulations Rabbi Rosenblatt, you just made an honest to GD fool of yourself.   ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right. I mean, to borrow a phrase from Daniel J. Solomon, how &quot;medieval&quot; is it to tell someone who suffers from depression that if they have a child they will magically be cured? And who is going to take responsibility for the child when the mother is crippled due to her depression? Can she drop off the baby at the Rosenblatts?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sarah Silverman is brutally honest and very, very self-aware. The choice to not have children must have been agonizing, perhaps as difficult as her depression itself. She should get all of the credit in the world for facing herself and doing what she feels is the right thing to do, against all of the built-in social (and, perhaps, biological) pressures that she knew would go along with the choice she made.


Rabbi Rosenblatt, perhaps, has never dealt with depression, never had to face postpartum depression, never had to deal with how depression might affect his ability to provide a baby with the love and nurturing it deserves, and never had to deal with the terrible prospect of bringing a life into the world, ostensibly to love it, and yet forcing it to deal with all of the above.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps this is a great time for Rabbis in particular to stop using the &#039;Open Letter&#039;. Pundits use it to great effect, because their job is to be seen as not caring about anything besides their views...

&#039;An Open Letter to Sarah Silverman: Dear Sarah...&quot; effectively translates to &quot;Attention all people who dislike Sarah Silverman, let me invoke her more-popular name in order to get attention...&quot;. A pundit can say such a thing, because publicly humiliating or bashing someone is part of their job. Nobody really minds. People expect better from religious leaders, as they should.]]></description>
