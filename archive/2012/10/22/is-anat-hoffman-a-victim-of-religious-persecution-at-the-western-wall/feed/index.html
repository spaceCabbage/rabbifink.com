		<description><![CDATA[The question of how the t&#039;shuva (halachic response) is to be implemented is critical, and a critical piece of Torah that seems often missed.  As R&#039; Fink observes, there is a difference between a t&#039;shuva/halacha/obligation specifically directed to an individual/organization and a t&#039;shuva regarding enforcement of a halacha by the community.  It seems that many people assume that the community and its individuals have a right and obligation to enforce halacha upon the community AND outside the community.  Maybe, that is a frequently incorrect assumption.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am blessed to live near Jerusalem, and frequently visit the Kotel.  

On many occasions  I have seen women wearing tallitot and / or tefillin on the women&#039;s side of the wall.  No one bothers them.  No one really cares.

So why does Ms. Hoffman seem to have a knack for getting clapped in irons?

Because that&#039;s exactly where she wants to be.  In cuffs, in the spotlight, screaming against G-d and His Holy law.

Any particular woman can bring whatever siddur, and whatever prayeraphernalia she wants to bring, to the kotel.  It only becomes a problem, of both local ordinance and halacha, when a group does something to triumphantly proclaim that they are right, and Torah is wrong.

Moreover, this isn&#039;t only a women&#039;s issue.

If a group of Reform men dressed in blouses and skirts to show solidarity with the &quot;transgender&quot; community.....if a bunch of people started an African drum circle......if Ju-Bus showed up and placed a giant statue of Buddha in the middle of the kotel plaza......all of these things interrupt the Kotel experience for the millions of visitors that go there annually.



Women can pray privately however they want to, at the kotel.  They simply can&#039;t make a spectacle of themselves, and ruin the experience for everyone else.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To all those caught up on the WoW&#039;s intent vs. R. Moshe&#039;s qualification - you are confusing cause and effect.

If the initial law had been (correctly) halachically decided to allow women to perform these mitzvot, then there would be no politics in doing so. One could assume that the average woman going to perform the mitzvot with a pure motive.


By taking away their right to do so, you have placed them in a Catch-22. By definition they have to be protesting the establishment and making a statement in order to get the rights that Halacha (should have) originally granted them. 


If the law were changed tomorrow to allow women to perform all of these mitzvot and nobody gave it a second thought, then by definition everyone would be doing them with a pure motive and the qualification would not matter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first time a woman showed up at the Kotel with a tallis or a sefer torah or t&#039;fillin, was she protesting?  Or, was she finding a way to serve G-d in a m&#039;hadrin (beautiful) way or inspirational way, according to sense of serving G-d?

Did she know  that this was unusual.  Yes.  Did she know that a bunch of men would flip out.  Probably.

After the men flipped out and she returned again, maybe part of her intent was &quot;protest&quot;, and maybe that protest was FOR G-d, FOR Torah, FOR Jews (and not just of the male gender) along with her original intent to serve G-d.

When the Jews killed Romans, was that &quot;protest&quot;?  Depends on whose perspective you look from.  Are women Jews, too?  Maybe, from their point of view, they are not &quot;protesting&quot;, they are just painfully dealing with a bunch men with inferiority complexes and an exaggerated estimation of their service to G-d and their understanding of Torah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. As I understand the halacha, mitzvot require kavana (proper intent).  That mitzvot are allowed to be done without kavana, as with most people&#039;s davoning, etc, is a &quot;kula&quot; (leniency) or bidieved (not the preferred way, OK after the fact) (leniency is probably a more appropriate term in this case).  All the reasons that I have ever heard from OJ rabbis in the US or Israel for present day people being able to do mitzvot boils down to: if it were not allowed, no one would be doing mitzvot.  So, the WOW people seem to be right in the meaty part of OJ behavior looking at it this way.

2. &quot;Legal and social recognition of their right, as women, to wear&quot; and participate in Jewish ritual and other activities that are permitted is a positive manifestation of G-d&#039;s will in this World.  This IS being closer to G-d.  Who are you to decide these things?  Who is anybody?  These activities are less controversial (except among a bunch of power hungry, violent people) than the activities and justifications of a bunch of power hungry, ingenuine, often violent people (read OJ sympathizers.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t generally follow your blog so it could be that you&#039;ve already mentioned this in a different post, but I am curious to hear your thoughts about the following. Would you consider &quot;Wow&#039;s&quot; services to be halachically prohibited under the law of kol isha - assuming that they are leining the Torah out loud and from the pictures in the article singing and dancing. Also Isn&#039;t kol isha at an army event one thing, and kol isha in a place where people are trying to daven another?
Looking forward to your response]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think that&#039;s true of Anat Hoffman, who is a political activist, first and foremost.  I&#039;ve read her piece in Huffpo  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anat-hoffman/arrested-for-praying-at-western-wall_b_1987099.html and an interview with her:  http://reformjudaismmag.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=1414

		<description><![CDATA[OK, re-reading the post, I see what you&#039;re saying - your analysis of the law is independent of WOW. Fair enough. And if I can match it up with a previous comment, you want to use R. Moshe conceptually permitting something as evidence of permissibility. Also fair. So while it may not be required to reference the condition, it would be helpful, especially since it is relevant to the cause at hand.

		<description><![CDATA[OK, but enough examples exist. But R. Moshe&#039;s qualification seems crucial, especially considering this context. I appreciate the fact that he&#039;s saying conceptually there is clearly a basis for permissibility; that is not insignificant. However, this isn&#039;t abstract. His qualification is quite relevant here, and I&#039;d argue you deliberately left it out because it hurts your premise.


In other words:

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OK, but enough examples exist. But R. Moshe&#8217;s qualification seems crucial, especially considering this context. I appreciate the fact that he&#8217;s saying conceptually there is clearly a basis for permissibility; that is not insignificant. However, this isn&#8217;t abstract. His qualification is quite relevant here, and I&#8217;d argue you deliberately left it out because it hurts your premise.</p>
<p>In other words:<br />

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s fair, but leaving it out is a misrepresentation, especially considering what you&#039;re trying to do with it. To say &quot;Rav Moshe permits it&quot; when he set specific criteria for when it is permitted is deliberately misleading. It would be like someone supporting a Jew convicted of fraud by stating, &quot;Well, Jewish law permits lying.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well you must love American tort law then! :)


I understand what you&#039;re saying, and I was only referring to the place of R. Moshe&#039;s psak in this discussion. His psak clearly states that intent is critical, thus it is a misrepresentation to imply that R. Moshe would condone WOW&#039;s mission.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d never actually read the R. Moshe Teshuva until now; thank you for pointing to the source. Having read the Teshuva, I think you are misrepresenting R. Moshe&#039;s psak. Saying that &quot;Feinstein writes that women are welcome to do these mitzvahs&quot; is not telling the whole story. He qualifies it, and makes it clear that their intent is a crucial component. In fact, he says if &quot;she is motivated by her grievance with God and His Torah, her deed is not to be considered a mitzvah at all, but on the contrary, a forbidden action.&quot; (Translation taken from here.) I don&#039;t claim to judge WotW&#039;s intentions, but you mention that they themselves claim their  “mission is to achieve the social and legal recognition of [their] right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray, and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall.” That reads as wanting to secure rights, not be closer to God. I&#039;m not saying there isn&#039;t something to be said for that, but this wouldn&#039;t be recognized as legal under Jewish law according to R. Moshe.]]></description>
