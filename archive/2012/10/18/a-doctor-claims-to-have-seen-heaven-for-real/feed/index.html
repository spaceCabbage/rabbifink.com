When in my twenties I overdid nitrous oxide..and blacked out...in the blacked out state I &#039;left&#039; my body and ascended to the outer edge of the atmosphere. Then I was in the blackness of space, saw stars and planets. I felt at peace. I also noticed that I was floating arms outstretched like on a cross. I noticed an intelligence far out in space, and it was communicating with me . It was mental communication, and its &#039;voice&#039; sounded like a million voices in one, and beautiful. It said I am safe and was there any questions I had. So I asked  why is there war, disease, death. Instantaneously I received answers that made perfect sense. then it said &#039;you are going back, its not your time&#039;. So I then descended back into my body and woke up. And couldnt remember the answers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You could always check YouTube.  There was a bit of a craze a couple years back of Israelis reporting their own neaar-death visions of heaven.  Unsurprisingly, they tended to fit right in with the descriptions given by whichever charismatic healing Rabbi with which the particular seer associated his teshuva.

The brain being out of service for some time doesn&#039;t make him dead. So yes, he came back. Doesn&#039;t mean the brain was working. BTW, all this is coming from the little knowledge of a graphic designer. Graphic designer, brain surgeon................close enough :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;What&#039;s your explanation? Do you believe the doctor that Jesus really is waiting for you on the other side?


Obviously the groups that taking up a few years to research this are slightly open to the idea that conscienceness is independent of the brain, since they themselves are saying you can&#039;t have dreams and hallucinations if the brain is flat-lined. Or else you can&#039;t run objective analysis. In order to do these experiments, you have to start with certain proven fundamentals. Now, perhaps, there is a slim slim chance that the brain keeps dreaming when it is flat lined. There is also the slim slim possibility that carbon dating is all nonsense and our entire dating method has been wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Hallucination is a result of brain activity, even minor activity.&lt;/i&gt;


This is probably correct. And in this case there were two periods of activity - one, while he was entering the come, and two, while he was exiting the coma. And hallucinations/dreams that &quot;feel&quot; like hours/days/weeks/months/years all take place in very short periods of time in the brain. Furthermore, not only were these two periods of regular activity, they were probably some form of traumatic activity, and that might stimulate more hallucinogenic/dream activity.

And I agree, science will not discover that the world is flat, nor will it discover a &quot;firmament&quot;. That&#039;s over with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course, but science isn&#039;t going to discover the world is flat. Hallucination is a result of brain activity, even minor activity. How can there be hallucination if the brain is flat lined? One of the ways organizations are testing if, for example, out of body experiences are real is testing brain activity. Meaning there is an objective way to find if these things are real or not. Tesyaa, sounds like the charedim who can&#039;t even entertain the thought that it might be real and therefore reasons something every scientist says is impossible. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;The obvious answer is that medical science doesn&#039;t know everything, and maybe it&#039;s quite possible to dream or hallucinate even when the brain appears inactive.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;So, this article is an affront to orthodox Judaism and all non-Christians.&quot; 


 Oh, don&#039;t be so overdramatic. 


 This guy had some kind of dream, and now he feels closer to G-d.  Good for him. 


 Obviously it doesn&#039;t change my understanding of &quot;Olam HaEmet&quot; 


 However, as you point out, there are many concepts that we Shomrei Mitzvot do agree with the Christians.


One very fundamental concept that we share is:   (Rabbi Fink&#039;s words)


 &quot;...consciousness is independent of brain activity and when we die our consciousness lives on in a perfect world.&quot; 


 There is a soul.  It is independent from the body.  The body is born, grows, ages, and dies.  


The soul is Eternal. 


 I&#039;m not making any comment on the way in which the good doctor &quot;proves&quot; this, scientifically.  


I&#039;m simply pointing out that, sans Tinker Bell and fluffy clouds, we do recognize that the consciousness, the soul, ascends to a realm outside of physicality, once a human body ceases to function.]]></description>

<p> There is a soul.  It is independent from the body.  The body is born, grows, ages, and dies.  </p>
<p>The soul is Eternal. </p>
<p> I&#8217;m not making any comment on the way in which the good doctor &#8220;proves&#8221; this, scientifically.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m simply pointing out that, sans Tinker Bell and fluffy clouds, we do recognize that the consciousness, the soul, ascends to a realm outside of physicality, once a human body ceases to function.</p>

Christians believe in this as well. Seems their belief of judgement is harsher than ours. I don&#039;t see a real a conflict in what he says vs what orthodox Judaism believes. Colloquially, when we say Heaven, we mean that place that we are allowed in after being judged worthy. OJ believe in that heaven being good. THAT is what the Dr. claimed he tapped into. The Good. 


Personally, I am more interested at why Newsweek decided to run this story. Was it really cover worthy? It almost seems like they purposely decided to pick the oddest story of an after-life dafka to show how stupid &quot;faith&quot; is.]]></description>
