		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Depends how you look at it. Were neanderthals wiped out on purpose? Or did they simply die out while the more evolved homo sapien live on?&lt;/i&gt;


Aha!!!! If God controls the [natural] event of a flood that wiped out most of humanity, then God also controls the [natural] events that wiped out the Neanderthals. Logically consistent argument :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why would the theodicy of the flood be of more concern than any other biblical story, dictum, or post-biblical occurrence?

God wiped out the first born of Egypt, presumably even if they were infants, when he freed us. 

Then there&#039;s the seven nations and Amalek that were to be wiped out with their children.  

Throughout history there have been various plagues, natural disasters, and evil regimes that wiped out people including children.

There&#039;s no &quot;good&quot; theodicy, but those who are religious accept G-d anyway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s another &quot;main issue&quot; you can add into the idea of a recent global flood, and that&#039;s science.   There are all sorts of problems from how did he fit all the animals given the number of species we are aware of today, to how they stored enough food, to whether such a boat could have built from wood.

However, I like the simple questions a child who frequents a zoo could ask like:  How did the Kangaroos get back to Australia?  (Even if you&#039;re willing to buy into all the explanations of how before the flood all the land was still one continent, you&#039;re still stuck with all these animals stranded on top of a mountain now, many who can&#039;t climb, etc. )   I think you&#039;re forced today to explain it as something other than a global flood covering Mt. Everest - even to children.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand your analogy. Just as the scientists are the creators of a new strand of beings, it supposedly gives them the right just like God had the right to wipe out the generation of the flood. So, again, since it never really happened, I guess the lesson is it discusses how all of humanity became evil. There are no innocents in the story. 


The difficulty is with those that believe that it actually happened. Do they really believe that everyone including the children were evil? How would God not distinguish between the good and the bad.


The lesson of the story is not about trees, but about the forest. God demands moral integrity from his creation: man.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two-part comment:
(a) I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s controversial (or worse) about the concept of current/past events already being known to b&#039;nei Yisrael when hQbH dictated to Moshe Rabbeinu precisely how and what to record.  Just as another (besides the above-noted flood narrative/history) example: the speech(es) that Moshe Rabbeinu made/gave to b&#039;nei Yisrael the month before he passed on are incorporated into Seifer D&#039;varim, not necessarily as Moshe actually said them but yes necessarily as hQbH had Moshe record them (and one consequence is the question of whether Moshe actually recorded his own death or, instead, Y&#039;hoshua recorded those eight verses).
(b) I don&#039;t see what you quoted R&#039;Hertz as writing about the flood &quot;story&quot; to necessarily be saying &quot;that the Torah incorporates legends that were part of Jacob’s family lore in a specific way and in turn they become Torah&quot;; I do see that quote as saying that b&#039;nei Yisrael had their own version of the &quot;story&quot; even though they knew of other versions.  Perhaps your inference is based on &quot;it...became an assertion&quot;? in which case see my first point :).  Thanks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, I really appreciate you tackling this issue because it is one that many Orthodox Rabbi&#039;s wouldn&#039;t touch with a ten foot pole. This post is a smaller microcosm for one my biggest problems with Orthodoxy-that the Torah is literally true and that everything in it is historically accurate. Whenever I read the Parsha, the first question I always ask myself is &quot;Did this really happen/ Is there scientific evidence to back this up/how likely is it that this event actually occurred?&quot; and the answer is almost always no.  It is difficult for me to understand how someone can push all of that aside and tell me that their &quot;faith&quot; is the reason they&#039;re able to believe that the Torah literally happened when we have no sufficient scientific evidence to back this claim up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;In other words, the story of flood need not be taken as a literal 
narrative that was told to Moses by God in a vacuum. Rather, the Jewish 
people knew this story, it carried a valuable lesson, and God

I&#039;m not sure I understand why you&#039;ve set this up as two mutually exclusive options. Why can&#039;t Hashem have told over an already-known story to Moshe in His own words? Isn&#039;t that what we assume to be the case for the stories of the Avos? Was, for example, &lt;i&gt;Akeidas Yitzchok&lt;/i&gt; only revealed once it appeared in the Torah? I would have assumed that many, if not most, if not all of Klal Yisroel had already heard of it by the time they were at Sinai.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; there
is much evidence for a flood at some prehistoric time. This explains why
almost every single ancient civilization has a flood story.


 


There’s also that
most ancient settlements (and many modern ones, too) were located  near large bodies of water, which inevitably
flooded every now and then. (New Orleans floods every sixty years or so.) Each
time a town flooded, some elder would no doubt recount the even worse flood of
his childhood – magnified through his then-childish- eyes. Then that story
would be retold the next time, magnified through time and the childish memories
of those who heard it… give it a few centuries, and the legendary great flood
covered the whole world and wiped out everything.


 


There’s also the
Mesopotamian legend of the king who rode out a flood on a barge full of
animals, and the theory about the Black Sea pouring through Bosporus and wiping
out all of the civilizations that had been located on what’s now the sea floor.


 


&gt; In
contrast, the Babylonian tale tells the story of quarreling Gods who deceive
one another and mankind.


 


And
who try to wipe out humanity because we’re too noisy.


 


&gt; I
can’t be certain, but this sounds to me like a borderline controversial
statement. It sounds like he is saying that the Torah incorporates legends that
were part of Jacob’s family lore in a specific way and in turn they become
Torah. 


 


That’s not borderline controversial. In the
yeshivish world, that’s kefirah, at least in the colloquial sense. 


 


Most frum (charedi?) people aren’t even aware
that the ancient myths exist, and when told, most often the reaction is to
assume that the myths are independent sources that are confirming the
historicity of events described in Tanach. The notion that the Chumash incorporates
 myths that were in circulation in the
ANE wouldn’t even occur to them.]]></description>
