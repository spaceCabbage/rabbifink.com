		<description><![CDATA[When I was pregnant, I felt closer to God than at any time before our since. I felt like a partner in creation. I ate right, exercised, saw the doctor, read about the process, rested, attended childbirth classes, etc, but I certainly had nothing to do with pouring the organs in the right place our choosing just the right neshama for my little one. That was God.

Since the time of Adam and Eve, God has allowed women to work with men to create pregnancies, but God and women have been longer term partners in the creation of full humans.

Modern doctors can create pregnancies through a variety of methods, and people have always had different ways to create families, but pregnancy is a special connection between a woman and God.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;When there is a uncertainty and doubt, the mind seeks to establish some control over the situation. Thus superstitions emerge. &lt;/i&gt;

Personally, I have found that as I have consciously moved away from using supersitious (religious) practices to cope with uncertainty and doubt, I am able to deal with things better, not worse.  Thre&#039;s a flip side of being beholden to superstition, which is guilt and self-blame when things do not go as one hopes and prays they will.

I feel much more emotionally healthy, even though I am aware that I am no more in control than before.]]></description>
