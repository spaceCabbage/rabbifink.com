		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d like to raise another controversial issue that might help clarify this argument: organ donations and transplants. As I think most people are aware, there are many poskim that do not recognize brain death as death. Therefore, Jews following these poskim are not permitted to donate organs upon brain death - which I believe makes organ donation impossible under most of not all circumstances. Yet, at least some of these poskim do allow a Jew to accept an organ donation even if brain death were the criteria used to enable the transplant. If an insurance program paid for organ donations based on brain death, would this be considered an attack on freedom of religion because it would be forcing employers to participate in a program that might encourage murder, according to halahca? Or would this be acceptable, because its providing for lives to be saved in a halachicly acceptable manner (from the point of view of the organ recipient)? My point in bringing this example is that once we start lobbying for religiously-based exceptions to health insurance programs, we&#039;re treading in some very complex territory. I don&#039;t think any government health insurance law could really address every religiously based reservation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;What fantasy world do you live in that the government doesn&#039;t impose on you? Do you have a driver&#039;s license? Do you follow zoning laws? Do you beat your children? Do you steal? Do you think these are NOT government impositions?! The government makes millions of impositions. I only need to protests the impositions that are offensive. THIS ONE IS NOT OFFENSIVE.


OH PHULEASE. Im strickly talking about government mandating the private citizen to buy something. If women want birth control, let them pay for it. Nobody is stopping them. Did I give any hint that I am against government enforcing law and order and the common protection of its citizenry? For crying out loud.

And if you don&#039;t find it offensive. Great for you. Then buy it for your employees. But let other organizations buy, or not buy what they want.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Pay for insurance thats provides it for free as opposed to with a co-pay.
1) Are there any insurances out there that DO NOT cover birth control?
2) Which insurance are they using now? Are they using a policy that does not cover birth control
3) I can understand if now they are forced to pay extra, specifically for the cause of birth control.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I imagine the Catholic church is large enough that in some places they may have been able to negotiate a customized plan to suit their needs although I don&#039;t really know.   However, I do understand why creating special protections for something they find abhorrent and in contradiction to their religious values is wrong.   

Vaccinations are also beneficial and cost saving to society but they are not free. 
Generic conception pills, without coverage, run about $30/month.  Is it terrible that an employee of the Catholic church pay $360 a year out of pocket for their pills?   For those who can&#039;t afford the $360, there already is gov&#039;t health care plans all tax payers pay for that will give it to them for nothing.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Yes. Insane to say that subsidizing BC is perfectly fine but giving it for free is an assault on religion. That is insane.
Most insurance companies offer birth control with prescription. There is nothing the Church can do about that. (plus you don&#039;t even know the plan the Church uses. It may not even cover, so who knows) But that is different than saying the organization is SPECIFICALLY paying for that specific product on top now. 

Clearly, the government is mandating something different here than has been the case till now. Instead of calling them insane, why don&#039;t you take your own medicine, and show a little more tolerance, and compassion, and actually ASK them, instead of name calling. There is obviously something here that you are missing. But its easier to simply call them names......because they are catholics]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Because they are BOTH an imposition by the government. You are looking at this in the micro, where you SHOULD be looking at it at the macro. If anything, if anything, I can understand government getting more involving in making brit milah since you ARE freaking mutilating a child here. 

And how is it so hard for YOU to understand that a religious organization finds birth control abhorrent. And now, they are forced to fund that abhorrence. Its IRRELEVENT if they specifically use it. They are FORCED to pay for it. I would never want my money going to something I find to be immoral. This isn&#039;t complicated Fink. 

Lets give you micro example for you to understand better. I once bought something non-kosher accidentally. I wanted to get rid of it somehow and someone, Jewish, wanted it. I told her that I could not give it to her. She got incensed that I was imposing my orthodoxy on her. But I&#039;m not. She, on her own, can do whatever she wants. But I don&#039;t have to actively give her something that I find morally wrong.

Yes, this is getting ridiculous already.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One more thing:

Do the religious groups also oppose insurance plans that subsidize birth control and it costs the user $10 instead of full price? Or do they only oppose FREE birth control? Because all insurance with prescription plans cover BC. Do the insurance plans at these religious places not cover BC at all?!

What is going on here!?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why is it so for you to see the difference between BANNING a religious activity that has not been shown to harm anyone and requiring companies that are run by religious people to provide insurance which provides birth control to people who use it?!


They have nothing to do with each other. I am getting tired of talking about this. Seriously. It&#039;s getting ridiculous already.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Um, for the sheer value of Liberty perhaps? That this entire country is founded on the principle of checks and balances and not giving too much power to the centralized government in fear (or as you call it, being paranoid) that they will end up deciding too much and imposing on the private citizens. LOL, paranoia!!!! The core principles of our legal system was founded on paranoia. 

Why not simply leave religious institutions alone? Why force them to pay for a moral wrong? Are women so entitled to free contraception that you have to minimize the liberty of another group for that end goal?What people like you don&#039;t realize is that power, and liberty lost don&#039;t happen overnight. It drips slowly and slowly. (It&#039;s what Thomas Sowell calls &quot;first stage thinking&quot;). Right now, our lovely county passed a law that you are fined $1000 for throwing a frisbee or football on our beaches. Do you think that sort of &quot;chutzpah&quot; to pass such laws would possibly exist if the state hadn&#039;t passed other laws, like absurd non-smoking laws? Or trans fat laws? You stop the state in the beginning, before they can get to this level of chutzpah. Because once they are on a roll, its very hard to stop them. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem with this view is that it enters extremely dangerous territory. It is impossible for the government to accommodate all religious views.

		<description><![CDATA[a) wow
b) I know this is one of those dividers between the right and the left, where the left likes to call anything they want for a free a &quot;public health issue.&quot; Nevertheless, the fact that it is for public health does not mean someone else should pay for it, let alone an organization that is dimatrically opposed to it. 
c)  Well, I think its jim dandy that you personally don&#039;t mind paying for it. If you are up for it, send a check, but would you side with OU if ever the government tried to impose something we were so opposed to? Either euthanasia or anything else we considered immoral. 
d) what is to stop Jews from using such services? It&#039;s not like you can dictate that the insurance only pays for non-Jews. 
e) again, I am just a little.....bewildered by you. We all are entitled to our beliefs an opinions ofcourse. But you carry on some sort of mantle of  &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; yet you would have no problem paying for a service that covered euthanasia? The fact that hypothetically it may be legally, does not make it moral. And I am equally bewildered that you think, by you NOT wanting to pay for it, (and letting others buy it themselves if they wish) it would be YOU that is imposing your values on others, rather than the government, out of nowhere, now demanding something out of you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps, (in a hypothetical scenerio) it would be the same as asking the OU to pay for insurance that would also provide free euthanasia. That particular service, that their money is going to, is an affront to their religion. Come on rabbi, you are being a little obtuse here, I think. 

You, as an orthodox rabbi, just think of any scenerio that deeply offends your religion, and then the government saying you must put in the money for that service. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If anything, you are all against a religions utopian supremacy, but have no problem with governmental views on a utopian supremacy. I&#039;m not saying the catholic belief should dictate birth control be flat out illegal in the U.S. But I also don&#039;t want governmental belief being imposed on an organization that clearly does not believe in it. The government is not &quot;accommodating&quot; anything here, since it is the government being active here, wanted to create something new and impose it on others. If anything you are asking the catholics to accommodate the government. So then I find it a little odd, that you are finding something odd in OJ organizations siding with the catholic church in this issue. ]]></description>

But to answer your question at least, the catholic church is comprised of....catholic citizens and government telling them they need to supply something (X) in which case they don&#039;t believe in (X). Now, rightfully, not every employee of catholic organizations are catholics, but you are still asking that organization to do something they don&#039;t believe in.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;  Choice three requires that costs be lowered. One useful tool in keeping health care costs down is to provide free birth control. This is a mathematical fact. It sounds crude and unkind. But it is true. Unwanted pregnancies are bound to happen in a free society and even if we all agree that there is it amoral to engage in activities that can create an unwanted pregnancy that doesn’t change the fact that they still occur. Providing birth control to everyone helps alleviate this burden. 

That is the math.&lt;/i&gt;

I like math! Apparently 99% (98% for Catholics) of couples use birth control today. Can you show us the math regarding how many fewer unwanted babies will be born if the law forces insurance to pay for it?
In my opinion, this is an almost purely political issue. Why? Because nobody has proposed a law to force insurance coverage to include immunizations, and immunization has as high, or perhaps higher, social benefit as birth control has.

Unfortunately, election years tend to bring out the politics of nearly every decision.]]></description>
