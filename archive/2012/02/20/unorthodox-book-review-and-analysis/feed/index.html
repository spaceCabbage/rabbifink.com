		<description><![CDATA[The biggest &quot;sin&quot; in the book is that the state and city governments allow the Hasidic communities to not only police themselves but to blatantly break the law.  The biggest example of this is education.  Feldman never compares her educational experience with that of the boys. Obviously she doesnt know what their experience was because boys and girls don&#039;t talk and she had no siblings.  But in NY state, all children must attend school until the age of 16, and there are a minimum of classes required and tests to be passed.  Why are the Hasidic communities allowed to avoid most secular classes? Where is the Regents Exams?  Why are they allowed to continue to not educate girls compared to boys? Every teenager in the state could sue based on what is required of them and not of the Hasidics.  The answer is obvious: if you educate your children, they will know they have choices in this world and the establishment leaders of the Orthodox communities do no offer choice]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nobody is saying that it was a chillul hashem that she left the community, rather the fact that she has to publicize every aspect of the negative facts of ultra orthodox lifestyle. She groups all ultra orthodox ppl in one lump making us all look like were a bunch of ignorant people. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;She probably would have been fine in a more moderate form of orthodox Judaism.&quot; Really? Mother turns out to be a lesbian and father is mentally ill and she would have done fine in a more moderate form of Judaism? I&#039;d say no matter what she would have been in for a long tough ride. Perhaps what you meant to say was she MAY have had a better fighting chance in a more moderate form of Judaism. &quot;Would have been fine&quot; is really not a fair statement to make. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry but i dont get one thing about what you claim the topic is the possibility to cover up murder. If it is as you said isnt it farfetched to pick up just one story that she heard from her bro in law that he decided its a murder cover up?? i think the topic of coverup takes much more that this. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will start by saying I did not read the book, nor after reading this review and the article in the NY Post, have any interest in reading it.  
There is clearly a motive here and it is not about exposing the truth.  For starters the title.  Why place the word &quot;scandalous&quot; in the title, if your motive is truth.  Truth sells itself and is stronger than anything else one can create.  It will be the last man standing when all the dust has settled.  Placing &quot;scandalous&quot; in the title bespeaks a need to attract attention and gives a reader a negative feeling from the beginning.  The need to portray the negative form the outset creates an unbalanced biased approach to the content of the book.  As if to say everything in this book will make you see how bad chassidic judaism is.  True or not the need to create the bias decries any claim of balanced unbiased portrayals of truth.
Reading the NYP article I got the feeliong she wanted to make quick money.  The article portrayed her as one who never had and was angry about it.  It appeared more as &quot;I am going to capitalize on this&quot; rather than a book about her experience and an interest of exposing some of the truthful dangers in the community she grew up.  Additionally any NY&#039;er knows the general content of the NYP is hardly newsworthy and they sell the paper based on their gossip sections more than anything.  That no other paper chose to interview her, is itself evidence to interest in controversy.

The review was nice and well balanced.  THe greater issue the book bespeaks, unfortunately is not one that will be solved on any blog.  Community leaders of each chassidic sect must address it themselves and hope they can fix it before we lose many more to secularism.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with you, however Deborah made it seem as though her grandfather had a temper.   She also did say what her issues were in her marriage:  Her husband&#039;s apathy, submissiveness to his mother, withdrawal from emotion; aside from the aggressive emotion he displayed with his son during toilet training.  He also seemed immature and naieve compared to her.  It seemed they argued most about his mother and sister.  It also seemed she was just not that interested in him from the beginning.  But that could also be because of her sexual suppression issues related to growing up in a very restrictive environment and it could also be because of her sexual assault which she claims to have. She also still seems angry in general.  I do agree with you though.  I lived in Monsey for a while, and I would have liked to know more about her life there.  I do agree that had she been brought up in a more open family she would have been happier.  However, she did state on her blog that she prefers not to play the &quot;what if&quot; game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As someone who used to follow her (now defunct)blog hasidic feminist, I&#039;m not sure the &quot;murder&quot; is the only thing fictionalized.  That is where this breaks down for me.  As more and more people come forward claiming to be old friends and family who say things like, most of her education was obtained in public school, that her grandparents were quite liberal, that her husband shaved his beard and payos, that they dated for months ect.  It becomes harder and harder to find the truth.  
I think most of the hatred, especially coming from those who claim to have known her, or who used to follow(often in horror) her blog(where the murder story was adamantly defended by her as absolute truth) is that they feel she is making a fictionalized horror story and peddling it as a real life account of the Orthodox/Haredi/Hassidic world.  
That things that she had admitted were fictionalized/dramatized for effect on her blog, made it into the book unaltered, I think further throws up red flags in the minds of many.  It does in mine.  I wouldn&#039;t mind an honest account of a hassidic rebel&#039;s story.  However one that has been fictionalized and dramatized for effect, that bothers me very much.  When the line between truth and fiction gets blurred one must wonder what, if anything can be believed.  Also it begs the question of motive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree. I personally think this book is a chillul Hashem, but I think the same about when it&#039;s frum people making themselves known for the wrong reason.

I know, desecration is. But it was the wrong word to use in that context. Okay, I agree. But I presume that in her writing of it, she&#039;s portraying the good as negatives, in addition to exposing the underbelly. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why?

Because of what I wrote. When it is a &#039;frum&#039; person they explain how it is anti-Semitism or not really a CH for whatever reason. But here without even reading the book it is called a CH. Is that not the very definition of hypocrisy? 
Two:

Betrayal is not the definition of CH. Further, I am speaking broadly, that if things in our community are considered &quot;true&quot; and &quot;good&quot; and &quot;moral&quot; and &quot;better&quot; then how can &quot;exposing&quot; those things be called a CH. Rather, by calling it a CH it indicates that the community is ashamed of the truth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good, balanced review. Thank you. I don&#039;t quite get what you&#039;re saying about chillul Hashem. Because there are people who cheat and steal, that means this book isn&#039;t a chillul Hashem? A chillul Hashem is when G-d&#039;s name is desecrated. If one person reads this book (or any of the hoopla surrounding it) and says &quot;How can the Chosen People behave this way&quot; or &quot;Jews are so elitist and condescending&quot; or whatever, it&#039;s a chillul Hashem, EVEN if it&#039;s true!]]></description>

If one person reads this book (or any of the hoopla surrounding it) and says &#8220;How can the Chosen People behave this way&#8221; or &#8220;Jews are so elitist and condescending&#8221; or whatever, it&#8217;s a chillul Hashem, EVEN if it&#8217;s true!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is that many different types of communities are necessary for the different kinds of people, but kids can&#039;t choose their community.  If parents prefer a more insular community and a particular child in the family doesn&#039;t fit in, that child is going to have a hard time. But a community that&#039;s right for that child may be wrong for another child in the family, or for the parents. It&#039;s easy to say that communities shouldn&#039;t be monolithic so that the non-conformists can be comfortable, but then what are the kids who are most comfortable in a more monolithic community supposed to do? (I&#039;m not talking about accepting others for who they are, which should be done everywhere.) I don&#039;t have a solution.]]></description>

I can&#039;t think of a single Satmar, for example, that has engaged with the world in a way that the world can understand what Satmar really is. Not even one. Same for Skver, Bobov, etc.

Chabad is the utter exception, but I don&#039;t consider Chabad to be in the same class as Chassidim, they are in a class of their own.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice review Rabbi Fink. 

1) You list every problem that she mentioned and continued that its not a scandal. You may be right that it doesn&#039;t  reach TMZ levels but its definitely half way there in presenting a community as guilty of these things when they claims to be the very opposite.  So scandalous: maybe not, but newsworthy: absolutely. 

2) Your point about the different levels of openness in the community and that one would have worked for her is a great point. I&#039;ve always thought that Chassidim who leave the fold would do well to move to an MO community instead of exiting stage right. The reason they dont, I think, is that they are brought up thinking MO arent good Jews, so why even bother, if you will be Modern Orthodox you might as well be secular. The same way you or I, if we wanted a lighter life wouldn&#039;t move to Reform, since we were raised to think it isn&#039;t authentically Halachic and hence a waste of time.  

3) Ýour last point about the hypocrisy of the critics claiming Chillul Hashem is amazing. Great point! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good, balanced review. The problem that I see with the book is that what is supposed to be a portrayal of someone who grows up in a &quot;broken home&quot; so to speak, becomes a portrayal of your standard Chasid. It&#039;s true that it&#039;s not &quot;an indictment of the entire chasidic community&quot;, but not every reader of the book is equipped to make this distinction between the &quot;bad, dumb&quot; guys and the normal guys.

Either way, as someone who grew up and still lives in this insular community Feldman grew up in, I can attest to the fact that most of what she says is quite accurate. I cannot conceive a murder being covered up, but then again, neither can I conceive an abuse being covered up.  ]]></description>
