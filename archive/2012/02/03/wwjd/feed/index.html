		<description><![CDATA[ But when you say, &quot;Political policy should be based on reasoning that is free from religious influence,&quot; you&#039;re saying that religious values are unacceptable motivations for public policy. Do you simply mean that Christian/Muslim/Buddhist arguments won&#039;t convince you? I doubt Obama&#039;s comment was meant to convince you. It was meant to convince Christians. And if a politician is truly motivated by the values of a particular religion (as opposed to currying favor among religious voters), I want to know it, because it says something about what other policies he/she might advocate. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This has nothing to do with the 1st Amendment. It has to do with how much weight I place in the values of other religions. I don&#039;t find other religious values persuasive. Acknowledging that God is part of a decision means nothing. Jihadists, Crusaders and Inquisitors all base their acts on God as well. For that matter, so do charedi extremists. It means nothing that they invoke God.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink - why do you want America&#039;s leaders to make decisions as if G-d does not exist?  

As an Orthodox Rabbi, I certainly hope that you recognize G-d&#039;s existence, and take it into account when making your own decisions.

The 1st Amendment prohibits the USA from making an official religion, and guarantees the people free exercise of their own religions.  

Nowhere does it say that religious values can&#039;t be used to influence public policy.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think HH&#039;s point is that the hypothetical war would be launched because of the general population&#039;s desire not to let evil spread in the world. You don&#039;t have to be a Christian to agree with that. You can say, &quot;OK, that&#039;s his reason for not wanting evil to spread, but I share his desire to curb evil despite not sharing his religious beliefs.&quot; Our religious beliefs mold our values, and our values mold our political orientation. If you ban all religious motivations, you&#039;re essentially banning all religious people from politics and government. If you allow religious motivations but ban statements thereof, you&#039;re simply encouraging politicians to be less than fully honest. 

I agree that &quot;Taxes should be raised because of Christian principles&quot; is an inappropriate argument, but I see nothing wrong with a politician saying that HIS motivation for raising taxes is Christian. It just isn&#039;t an effective argument for convincing YOU. He&#039;ll have to come up with a different argument if he wants YOUR support. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Tachles: If someone adds a &quot;religious&quot; reasons for their policy, I don&#039;t care, as long as it is a policy that has a secular/civil purpose. 

So 1) No, to a politician saying &quot; I believe we have to launch this war because Jesus would want that and we have to show those people the true religion&quot; 2) Yes to a politician that would say &quot;We have to go to this war because thousands are dying and we have to capture this tyrant. It is what any good christian would do based on everything we have been taught about not letting evil spread in this world and defiling it.&quot;There is a difference. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t talk to me like a fool rabbi. My point, and my only point has been where it comes from. And as long as the justification can carry a viable civil and secular purpose, I simply don&#039;t care, nor do I need to get offended if they ALSO mention a diety. Are you offended when a politician says abortion is an afront to God? (not Jesus, but God)? Does that mean that politician can NEVER vote against abortion?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;What I am saying is that if a policy is worthwhile it should be justified independent of religious beliefs.
DUH!! That is what I said. I am merely saying they are not mutually exclusive. Where the hell did I say it was necessary? I&#039;m saying if you DO have a policy that does come from a strong religious devotion (ANY religion) it needs to have secular reasoning to it as well. Once again, for the billionth time, I bring up murder. So if I was to say, I am against murder because of my religious devotion you would automatically discard that? So he Obama is welcome to bring his faith into the discussion since he is talking about taxes, which has a secular component to it as well. Or, we should be careful about the delicate blossoms that might get offended.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand that principle very well. But it&#039;s irrelevant. If a religion provides a good idea, the idea should be able to stand on its own without resorting to appealing to the authority of the religion. So if Jesus said something that is a universal good, it should be self evident. There is no need to say &quot;it&#039;s good BECAUSE it comes from Jesus&quot; simply because I don&#039;t need to believe that something is good just because it came from Jesus.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No. I am rejecting your premise that it is necessary to inject religion into policy making. It just happens that your current religious beliefs match with the current version of Christianity. But as I pointed out, there are religious beliefs that are not compatible with your beliefs. I chose an extreme example to make my point but there are plenty of things that even you, Mr. Republican Orthodox Jew disagree with Christians about.

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Revenge? To tax them? To make them slaves? To assert your military might? Ethnic rivalry? Racism? There are plenty of reasons.
Fine. Fair enough. So lets just run with your assertion on Islamic Jihad. Each one of them can be cross referenced whether its constitutional or not. Can you make slaves in America? Nope. Can you tax them simply because they are of a different religion than you are? Nope. Also, all those reasons only serve the benefit of THAT religion and that&#039;s all. It clearly is meant to discriminate against other people. Seriously rabbi, people&#039;s values don&#039;t come out of some void. There are religious values that have only religious purposes to it, and there are religious values that can also have secular purposes to it. How is this so hard to understand?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You misunderstood (or simply did not read the whole comment).

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Political policy should be based on reasoning that is free from religious influence.
So, I agreed with everything except with this. I don&#039;t believe they are mutually exclusive. Whether you are on the right or left, both have certain core values. Those values emanate from somewhere (call it religion or humanism or social darwinsism, whatever). There were those fighters for emancipation that used religion as their push (as well as those pro-slavery). As long as that influence can be reasoned, I see no issue from where that value came from. &quot;I believe murder is wrong because God said so&quot; But clearly, there is reason behind that as well. ]]></description>
