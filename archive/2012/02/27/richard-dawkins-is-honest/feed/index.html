		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to interject here.  I just want to say (as a shtark Atheist myself) that I find your beliefs a lot more &quot;dangerous&quot; than Rabbi Fink&#039;s.  Yes, I, one who has turned away from frumkeit, find myself siding with an Orthodox Rabbi on an issue.  Now doesn&#039;t that say something about which belief resounds more?  

Although I choose not to believe myself, I still have the utmost respect for Rabbi Fink, for not only being honest about the parameters of his beliefs, but also for being a real mentsch about it.  I have tried proving that God exists for a good deal of my life.  There are those who base their beliefs on &quot;proof&quot;.  But in the end, it is faith that backs these proofs.  For no proof is completely infallible.  Even the solidest or scientific principles are only true based on the assumptions being true.  And if you disagree with me, I suggest you pick up any textbook on Formal Logic and read the first chapter again.  Then, look over the chapter on Truth Tables.  And if you still disagree with this, then we have little else to talk about. Rabbi Fink is honest enough to admit that whatever logical rationale there may (or may not) be for frumkeit, his beliefs are based on faith.  And he is a man who loves what he teaches, loves his fellow man, and it emanates even over this very impersonal digital media.  And again, I reiterate, even a calloused OTD such as myself can read his blog and enjoy what he writes, though I may not agree with some of the pragmatics.  I might be the oddest choice of a person to defend him.  But still, I find those who try to reduce religion to something logical a lot more dangerous than ones who honestly base it on faith!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not impossible, but harder.  Remember, in Logic, a Modus Tolendo Tolens is a stronger argument than a Modus Ponendo Ponens.  This is because for a Modus Ponendo to be true, it has to be true in all cases; find one exception, and the Modus Ponendo is wrong.  A Modus Tolendo, however, is correct so long as there&#039;s even one case where it works!  I believe it was Einstein who said that no amount of tests can prove him right, but all it takes is one test to prove him wrong.

So yeah, you can throw all the &quot;proofs&quot; for God&#039;s existence out there.  They are only as veritable as the reader allows them to be.  In the end, &quot;faith&quot; is the strongest form of proof out there.  To the skeptic, the burden of proof is one the faithful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good post.  I think your probably right, Richard Dawkins is just being honest.  I&#039;m a believing Jew, but I don&#039;t begrudge anyone who doesn&#039;t believe in the existence of God or is simply unsure about such beliefs.  However, my issue with those like Dawkins is that they consider any type of religious belief to be superstitious, evil nonsense that stupid people mistakenly believe.  In that, Dawkins proves himself to be just as narrow minded, dogmatic, and intolerant as any religious fanatic.  But, he is honest...  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again, I think your premise is flawed. God made a communication with mankind and gave us the Torah. That is why we keep it. Not because it can be proved to be truth. One has nothing to do with the other. It&#039;s true that I cannot disprove another belief, but I can show it is less reasonable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If no one can prove it then I would not be wrong for saying it isn&#039;t the truth.  How can one be punished for doing wrong when the validity of that wrong, i.e. that it is the word of God, cannot be proven.
I am not necessarily saying it can be proven, though I believe it can, but there is a major flaw in preaching that you should believe base on substantial reasoning.  If you cannot prove it, you cannot disprove any view that chooses not to believe. 
Again, I am not attacking your personal beliefs, although I may have come across that way. I apologize for that. I am engaging in debate to point out an inherent danger in preaching such a belief.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It CAN be true and it CAN be false.  Without a proof there is no way to know which way is correct.  You cannot fault someone for saying &quot;I find this lifestyle too restrictive, I cannot prove its true and therefore don&#039;t want to follow it.&quot;
Preaching about a great lifestyle and how you feel connection is all nice.  What if that persons doesn&#039;t feel a connection, or finds the connection and niceties in Christianity or Buddhism or some other religion. Why is that any different?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Something can be true without proof. I don&#039;t understand why you insist otherwise. I have only provided an out for someone like yourself who feels there must be proof. 
I am telling you what I tell anyone who asks me the same question as you did. I cannot prove anything. I preach that Judaism is a beautiful life and  the Torah contains infinite wisdom. It seems to me that this is truth. I invite you to study Torah, experience Judaism and decide if you think it is a life worth pursuing and ultimately whether you believe it is true. 
It is worth noting that the Torah itself does not attempt to persuade the Jewish people that God exists using logic and proofs. It is experiential. We perceived God based on our experiences with God. Upon this experience all of Judaism is built. Our great grandparents experienced God. They lived it and taught it to us and it was included in the Torah to give us a taste of that experience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What are you talking about?

Look, do you think there is a proof for the existence of God? I&#039;d love to hear it. In my experience, there is no such thing as proving the existence of God. 
I have explained that I don&#039;t require proof for religious beliefs. Rather I believe based on many factors that there is a God and that he gave the Torah to the Jewish people. I cannot prive it. I can explain why it is a reasonable belief. In fact, I believe it is more reasonable than the alternatives. 
Your assertion that unless one can prove Judaism one is orthoprax is ludicrous. No one has successfully proved the truth of Judaism or the existence of God with the vigor required by academic research. So I guess every Jew is orthoprax.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So if there is no proof that God exists then why believe in a religion that is completely dependent on that belief.  If you cannot prove that God exists you have completely undermined all beliefs of Judaism.  Why then are you a rabbi of an orthodox shul?  Why be Jewish why not Christian or Islamic or Buddhist?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem is when people say that our inability to prove scientifically that God exists is proof that He doesn&#039;t exist. Of course, you could just as easily say that our inability to prove scientifically that God doesn&#039;t exist is proof that He does exist. 

Then there are the people who think that unless we have proof of God&#039;s existence, we have no reason to assume He exists and act accordingly. But we are constantly acting on the basis of less than 100% certainty. We can&#039;t be sure our food isn&#039;t poisoned, we can&#039;t be sure we won&#039;t be electrocuted next time we turn on a light, we can&#039;t be sure our doctors are giving us good advice. The question is whether God&#039;s existence is likely, not whether it is certain.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Really? Go ahead. Try me.
Let&#039;s go back and read what you said:

&quot;rather because it is impossible to prove God exists and it is not necessary&quot;

I am saying, that you have them wrong. They are not saying proof of God is impossible. They are saying there isn&#039;t any. These are two different things. Lehefech, they are always challenging us to supply them with it. Fact of the matter, if God tomorrow caused the entire oceans to turn red, and a voice from heaven commanding pigs to fly, that would be proof of His existence. The point is, they are actually looking for supernatural proofs to back up our supernatural claim. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;
If he is being honest, we should be honest as well.&quot;

I&#039;m not really sure what you&#039;re getting at with that last sentence. Do you mean Jews (religious) should be honest that they don&#039;t know for certain that God exists, or just a general call for reasonableness in honesty in all matters. 

I hope its not the latter, since that would be really Charedi territory in which the working premise is that atheists, or non Jews are generally liars or cheats and look how we found at lease one redeeming quality.......and now we have to match and beat them.

If its the former, ok that a good idea but good look with that. ]]></description>
