		<description><![CDATA[ &quot;Children like this are increasingly rare in our pop-culture-adoring, screen-addicted world.&quot;
Her reasoning that you quote for being fond of Orthodox Jews is poor. There are plenty of Orthodox kids who do sit in front of the TV all day. Every little pisher I see has their own iPhone or iPod. To make it seem that Orthodox Jewish kids have a monopoly on reading, imagination or recreation is ludicrous. I would argue that religion doesn&#039;t play a major role in whether these kids turn out okay or not - rather its the parenting and education they receive. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;We should be teaching our children that our lifestyle is beautiful on its own. Even without magical rewards or special prizes in the next world.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;
Our lifestyle is beautiful on its own.  So is the lifestyle of the Mormons; and they get to drive and use electronics on Saturday, eat whatever they want, can marry whomever they want (following a quick and easy conversion), and aren&#039;t required to live in very expensive urban areas in order to practice their faith.

If the only reason to be an Orthodox Jew is our beautiful lifestyle, I might as well become a Mormon.  Similar beautiful lifestyle, without all of the cumbersome rules.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is funny. When we were kids we were &quot;tormented&quot; by the fact that we had no T. Everyday the kids in school would discuss the T shows and we felt so dum not knowing about that stuff, but my father was adamant there would be no TV in our home. Of course today I puke at the mere thought of TV and can&#039;t be thankful enough to my dad. My kids go to a more black hat school, so they don&#039;t have that problem...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi, greetings.  I am an atheist and am, in fact, not Jewish, but hold the values and lifestyle of my Orthodox Jewish neighbors here in metropolitan Baltimore in very high regard.  Without over-idealizing, I must confess that the Orthodox Jewish community and social norms are a tonic and vaccine against many of the social ills that burden modern life.  Alas, my mother is just too good a cook for me to convert ;-)  All the best to you and your congregation, Bruce Godfrey, Attorney at Law, Owings Mills (Baltimore), Maryland.]]></description>
