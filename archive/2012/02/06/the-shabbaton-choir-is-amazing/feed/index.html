		<description><![CDATA[My point is that the piece is part of an old, yet vibrant Jewish musical tradition. It&#039;s not Carlebach or Chassidic-pop, both of which are much newer, but it is just as authentic and original.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Ein Kehokeinu is a modern cantorial classic. It was composed by Talmon and was made especially famous in the Great Synagogue of Jerusalem by Naftali Hershtik with his son Netanel (now at The Hampton Synagogue) as child soloist. Rabbi Rosenfeld was a chorister at the Great Synagogue and much of the GS sound is in the Shabbaton experience. Many more of their pieces were composed by Stephen Glass, now the musical director of Shaarei Hashamayaim in Montreal, another great bastion of cantorial/choral music.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, sounds like you enjoy choral music.  I grew up in a k&#039;hillah (KAJ/&quot;Breuer&#039;s&quot; of Washington Heights, NYC) which had and still has a [maile] choir which sings during the davening (and on special occasions).  Some of the compositions they sung/sing can be heard at the site of a k&#039;hillah based in Ramot, Y&#039;rushalayim (http://kayj.org/nusach/nusach.html ; I&#039;m not sure if any are recorded with a choir, but the Ein Keilokeinu ones, the 1st and 3rd of which I recognize from my youth, are not).  I know KAYJ has released some choral compositions on CD -- perhaps someone would be interested in contacting them for details.  I don&#039;t know where else these compositions may be available on the Internet -- perhaps at the Dartmouth Jewish Sound Archive (http://djsa.dartmouth.edu/)?]]></description>
