		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t feel your remarks merit a response but so that no one will think I agree with you in anyway... here it is.   

Removing a law from the Torah is not permitted under any circumstance.  However, that does not mean that there aren&#039;t ways to be able to solve societal problems presented by them.   For example the Torah permits multiple wives, over 1000 years ago it was accepted as prohibited in the Ashkenzic world and today is nearly universally accepted among all Jews that they can only have one wife.

To solve the Agunah problem, chazal permitted sending emissaries of the court to beat the daylights out of the husband until he stated that the get was being delivered of his own free will.  Do we call that coercion?   No, we call it showing him the light, that he really wants to do the right thing, so at the time he submits, he&#039;s truly doing it of his free will.  (even as he stands there beaten to a bloody pulp).    If law enforcement officers in your local municipality used this technique to obtain a confession - and explained that the accused was really acting of his own free will once his evil inclination was subdued - would you give them a pass?   Would you expect any rational, thinking person to accept the validity of such a confession?   Of course not.  But, when chazal says it works, we accept it.   Their &quot;brilliance&quot; in offering this as an acceptable way of obtaining a get, through some &quot;creative&quot; logic was accepted because it solved a problem that needed solving. 

Today, if you try to implement chzal&#039;s remedy you&#039;re going to create and chillul hashem and rightfully end up in jail.  In the USA we do not permit any group to take the law into their own hands like that or before you know it we&#039;ll be justifying Islamic &quot;honor&quot; killings.

So, it&#039;s time for some new creative thinking.  Just like chazal expanded the definition of what &quot;free will&quot; meant in their day, so too we must look to see where we can use either secular law or stretch the limits of halacha in our day to solve this problem.   I think the Conservative movement gets credit with being the first in North America to tackle the problem with the inclusion of &quot;The Lieberman Clause&quot; about 60 years ago.  There seems to be evidence that Rabbi Soleveitchik agreed that this was halachic, but the Orthodox community never agreed to incorporate it.   The RCA, some thirty years later came up with a pre-nup agreement that hasn&#039;t seen widespread use.   Finally about 6 years ago the RCA passed a resolution that &quot;no rabbi should officiate at a wedding where a proper prenuptial agreement on get has not been executed&quot;.  Look to any movement within Orthodoxy to the right of the RCA, and you don&#039;t find solutions. 

A pre-nup is hardly a radical change.  T&#039;naim were an early pre-nup of a different kind.   It&#039;s not like they even have to entertain more radical ideas like Kedushim with Tnai, Annulment by Bait Din, or anything that stretches tradition and might truly be deemed as &quot;chadash&quot;.   So, 60 years after the Conservative movement demonstrated that they were willing to tackle this problem, the Orthodox community still has no answer that&#039;s applied with any kind of consistency and regularity.

Why?   Why don&#039;t rabbi&#039;s today have the gonads to demand even the most feeble steps such as a pre-nup be taken to solve one of our major problems today?   Why do the so-called &quot;Gedolim&quot; on the right opine about all sorts of problems facing Judaism from the Internet to the LWMO positions but have not done anything to solve Agunot?

		<description><![CDATA[I think the Torah commandments that exist but have no bearing on life today like genocide and slavery, pale in comparison to those that still affect us today.   Perhaps Judaism&#039;s most &quot;Abhorrent Belief&quot; in our day is women&#039;s disadvantaged position in the halachic framework, and I am not talking about getting an aliya or some other synagogue ritual.  The immutable fact that the Torah tells us
וְכָתַב לָהּ סֵפֶר כְּרִיתֻת וְנָתַן בְּיָדָהּ, וְשִׁלְּחָהּ מִבֵּיתוֹ.
A Jewish divorce requires the MAN to grant it to her [of his free will].
He then sends her from HIS house.   So, in our day we continue to be plagues by the problem of agunot, chained women, and even in cases where the women is able to receive her divorce, it is often at the expense of submitting to her husbands extortion.      The fact that we have not been able to come up with a uniform approach of effectively overcoming this 21st century aberration in our day is a chillul hashem. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice post.  There is one point I disagree with.  Your definition of an abhorrent belief.  Just because someone is offended shouldn&#039;t make it abhorrent.  To an outsider it may look offensive, but his lack of understanding may be the reason he finds it offensive.  For example, giving a child medicine.  An outsider sees a kid kicking and screaming as we try to get that horrible tasting medication down his throat without him gagging, choking, and throwing up the entire dose.  The outsider may think we are crazy and abusive to our child and is offended by such abuse, but really we are helping the child and there is nothing offensive in that action.  I think a more proper definition may be, a belief that is intended to be antagonistic i.e. baptizing the dead, or a belief that is offensive and has no rational, moral, or logical explanation (more like a superstition).  ]]></description>
