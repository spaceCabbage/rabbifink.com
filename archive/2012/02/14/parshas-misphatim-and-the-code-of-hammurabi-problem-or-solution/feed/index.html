		<description><![CDATA[I just want to say that one good explanation for this midrashic/aggadic statement is that the knowledge contained in the Torah is embedded in the creation.  Meaning, it is possible through the study of creation to acquire the essential knowledge found in the Torah.  Our ancestor Avraham accomplished this, and indeed Rambam makes it evident that mitzvot are designed to help man achieve his perfection, something that can be done without Torah but which is extremely difficult.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Then I guess the entirely made up notion that the Penteteuch was written before creation -- which makes no sense to begin with -- must be tossed.  Who would have ever accepted it to begin with?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) I believe Bible critics claim that individual sections of the text existed before the second Temple period, and someone merely pieced the whole thing together around then. The Hammurabi findings do not contradict that assertions.

2) The similarities between Mishpatim and the Code of Hammurabi does not bode well for the opinion that the entire Torah was written before creation. It&#039;s fair to say that a Divine being deliberately &#039;borrowed&#039; from an existing code of law that people would have been familiar with in order to highlight contrasts, but it&#039;s just awkward to argue that the exact wording of the Code of Hammurabi was curtailed by the Creator such that the Torah, which was determined before everything, would sound similar to it. I don&#039;t think anyone posits a level of Divine control that&#039;s so specific. We believe in free will.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is one of the best posts I&#039;ve seen on any blog in a long time. I completely agree with your approach - if Torah is truth, what we can be possibly fear from science and scholarship? Of course, we should approach science and scholarship with healthy skepticism, but skepticism is far different from blanket rejection. I read a different explanation of the &quot;problem&quot; with Hammurabi&#039;s Code recently on a different blog - this explanation was that Avraham Avinu knew Torah, as some Midrashim indicate, and taught these laws to Hammurabi - a very unsatisfying explanation, since it completely ignores the moral &quot;improvement&quot; that your post brings out. Hammurabi didn&#039;t need Avraham to teach the idea of law, but we needed God to bring us the ethical component that transforms Torah from simply a legal code to a spiritual system that goes way beyond providing merely a convenient and utilitarian way of running a society. Shabbat Shalom.]]></description>
