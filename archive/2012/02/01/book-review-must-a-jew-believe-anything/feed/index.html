		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t believe this is the actual reason there is no interaction. Kellner does. I disagree. I think that even with approval from rabbis, no orthodox family would want to expose their family to the &quot;other side&quot;. Think about it. Most RWOJs don&#039;t interact with Modern Orthodox families either. And there is no rabbinic edict prohibiting that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The reason there is little interaction between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews has very little to do with halacha.&quot;

Really?    See the text of the psak (March 1, 1956) of 11 prominent roshei yeshiva placing a ban on joining the Synagogue Council of America and the New York Board of Rabbis as well as any other groups which are composed of Reform and Conservative Rabbis:

&quot;Conservative and Reform clergy are guilty of heresy, because they deny the truth of the WrittenTorah and the origin from Sinai of the Oral Torah. Therefore, participation in the SynagogueCouncil of America and the New York Board of Rabbis, both by individual Orthodox rabbis andby representatives of Orthodox groups, is forbidden. (Bunim 1989, 231)&quot; http://books.google.com/books?id=WaObe1cRLc0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+fire+in+his+soul&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sGkrT-TNH8K02gXQwsTyDg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20fire%20in%20his%20soul&amp;f=false]]></description>

If we were to judge importance by time spent on an issue pigul and eiruv would be very high on any list. In addition to the Mishna and Talmud re beliefs  the siddur is  an important work of chazal and the siddur is a very important book of  &quot;faith or beliefs&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read both &#039;Must a Jew Believe Anything&#039; and &#039;Maimonides Confrontation with Mysticism&#039;, and I&#039;ve always felt the title of the former should indicate the stress on &#039;believe&#039; and not how one would naturally read it with the stress on &#039;anything&#039;.

I don&#039;t really have much to say about the books, other than I wish more people would read them. Primarily because I wish more people knew and realized that much of what they identify as basic Judaism, assuming its been this exact was forever, is really nothing more than an accident of history.  

BTW, dont know if you used the oxford comma somewhere here, but you didnt at this point: &quot;metaphysics, mysticism and Zohar-centric Kabbalah&quot;]]></description>
