		<description><![CDATA[No, I have actual examples of people with balls surviving over people without balls. My grandmother, her aunt, and one of her sisters literally sneaked out of a ring of Nazis at the train station in Graz, Austria. They went under the arms of Nazis and sneaked under the train cars and hid on the other side for a while, then during the commotion of loading and beatings, they sneaked away into the nearby treed area, then hid there until the Nazis left the area (after the trains began their journey to the concentration camp). From there they walked through a few countries ending up a few months/years later in the hills of Italy where they his for the duration of the war.


Why do you doubt that smarter people and people with more courage than others survived over those who were more docile and sheep-like?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My pet theory is they hate us because we killed [all] their gods. By inventing/popularizing monotheism. That is the initial cause of the hatred, later it became ingrained among many people (all Christians for example), and even later among Muslims. They&#039;ve been slaughtering us throughout history (more about that later).



After all that, I think there is also hatred because despite all the slaughter, despite the casual discrimination, and despite all the institutionalized discrimination, Jews tend to survive even under the worst of conditions. And, worse, Jews tend to thrive under good conditions. For example, in the USA, Jews have a higher average level of education, and a much higher average income (about twice as much as the overall average income according to most recent reports). So there is jealousy, now add that jealousy to historical ingrained &quot;otherness&quot;,  and you get more hatred.


Ironically, it is possible that Jews excel precisely &lt;i&gt;because&lt;/i&gt; of the periodic slaughter, in which presumably the less fit (from a Darwinian standpoint) are more likely to be slaughtered, while the more fit (smarter, quicker, craftier, etc) are less likely to be slaughtered, and thus live on to promulgate their &quot;fitter&quot; genes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I commented on Rabbi Slifkin&#039;s blog questioning whether irrational antisemitism implies a divine cause.  Certainly, the scale of the Holocaust is often counterintuitively invoked as &quot;proof&quot; of God&#039;s love for Israel (I never understood that one, despite hearing numerous explanations).


It&#039;s innumerate to assume that no nation could be so hated without a supernatural cause.  There are many nations, and history is very long.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that for more conventional traditionalists (i.e. most of the Charedi world) one not need struggle to find supernatural phenomena to take pride in Jewish exceptionalism, since that Jewish exceptionalism is strongly present in every aspect of hashkafa.

Ironically, someone like Rabbi Slifkin, who works to provide a rational bent, is thus left with less of a sense of that chosen-ess pervading every part of his philosophy and thus grabs onto it where he can.

This is in no way a criticism of R Slifkin himself. I think his approach is in keeping with certain streams of thought in Jewish tradition. But I agree with you.



Interestingly, anti-Semitism is the very phenomenon that may have caused and strengthened the Jewish desire to assert exceptionalism in the first place.]]></description>
