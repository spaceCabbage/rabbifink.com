		<description><![CDATA[With respect rabbi, this is about an interpretation of specific commandments.  Reform doesn&#039;t just say &quot;ignore the Torah&quot;.  Rather, they read each commandment, look at it in a historical context, look into the words of the text, and try to apply it to a modern world.


So, if Orthodox Judaism claims that the interpretation of theology or practice have never changed, I can understand their aversion to accepting more evolved interpretations to practice Judaism in today&#039;s world,


But if you now say that you recognize that both theology and practice do indeed evolve, why shackle yourself to older, more rigid interpretations, that bar you from eating with other people, marrying outsiders, and thus having a greater influence as an &quot;or la goyim&quot; ?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You seem to have misunderstood what the post was about. The issue was what version of monotheism did our ancestors practice. It&#039;s an issue of interpretation of the Torah and how and if that interpretation has changed at all. But all agree that Judaism requires monotheism. The issue you are raising is not about interpretation of monotheism or of a specific commandment. It is an issue of whether the commandments are binding. On that all orthodox Jews have always agreed and will always agree - they are. I hope this clarifies your confusion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If &quot;everything is still evolving&quot;, as you agreed to above, then the commandments can&#039;t be &quot;unchanged and unchangeable&quot;


Since we&#039;ve evolved to the point of being able to cook pork without getting trichinosis, and since the Torah says that the reason Jews can&#039;t eat pig is because it is &quot;unclean&quot; - well, now it is clean.  


I&#039;m rereading what I just typed, and I honestly don&#039;t want to seem like I&#039;m attacking you.  I really want to understand what you are claiming.  An Orthodox Rabbi agrees to the statement &quot;everything is still evolving&quot;, and then adds &quot;it has always been that way&quot;


So, Reform Judaism has continued the evolution.  Why won&#039;t you join them, and rid yourself of the strictures of a bygone era?  Haven&#039;t we evolved past that all of that?]]></description>

The Torah is very clear about the obligations of man. If one doesn&#039;t keep the mitzvos, one is not keeping the Covenant. Sect is not really relevant. The only consideration is adherence to Torah and Mitzvos. Those are basically unchanged and unchangeable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[but if it has always been this way, then G-d won&#039;t be upset with you, me, or any other Jew, for practicing the evolution of Judaism called Reform, instead of the evolution of Judaism called Orthodox.


Is that what you believe?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, i don&#039;t have time to crack the books right now, so I have been winging it.
Let me just suggest that you identify a significant sample of occassions where you believe that the term Apikorus has been competently used, and then see how well each instance of its use fits my definition (or how often its implication in each instance can be reduced to my definition). 
Let me know what you come up with.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i am very curious to see the sources you rely on and to understand your thought process, but I&#039;m skeptical of your definitions as they stand now, without any proof.

I also want to be clear that I&#039;m not trying to say that you do not have any opinions and/or sources to rely on. I am simply saying that Rabbi Fink&#039;s positions should be considered as traditionally Orthodox as yours are.

For this point  I again urge you to read the books i listed in the post above.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A Mumar is someone who has a policy of violating or neglecting any commandment.

A Kofer is someone who denies a fundamental of Divinity. (e.g. God&#039;s existence, mastery, omnipotence, oneness, attentiveness so-to-speak, etc.)

An Apikorus can conceivably keep all Mitzvos and believe in all fundamentals of Divinity. So and Apikorus is distinguished from a Kofer or a Mumar.

An Apikorus is what you see when you look in the mirror. Just kidding. An Apikorus is someone who finds inspiration in positing imaginary limits on things which are incalculably greater than himself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey snowbird- I understand your reservations about Rabbi Fink&#039;s positions, so I&#039;m giving you a link to a post with some recommended reading regarding the issue of what kefira actually is. I think you will find that these books will enhance your accusations of heresy in the future, because you will have some knowledge with which to back yourself up.
On a note of achdus, i too like swimming.

		<description><![CDATA[E Fink, I think that you have clearly displayed your Apikorus credentials and are now irrelevant to Orthodoxy. You will assert that this is not Apikorsus, and it is a shame that you truly have evolved to belive that. You are embroiled to be able to identify your folly - while your great-grandmother&#039;s coloured maid would be able to instantly discern it.
To think that I almost prayed at your Shul on the Beach! (I decided to go swimming instead.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, you misunderstood me. It seems that from the evidence (and the Torah) we see Judaism was in fact monolatry and only later evolved to be monotheistic. I am simply questioning the logical conclusion of Schiffman&#039;s analysis. That We are the ones that defined Hashem and Judaism and not the other way around. But he wouldn&#039;t accept that. It makes no sense to agree with Schiffman (as R&#039; Fink did) and still maintain an orthodox hashkafa. That they answer to this is: &quot;Maybe God allowed for belief in other gods&quot; just sounds wishy-washy]]></description>
