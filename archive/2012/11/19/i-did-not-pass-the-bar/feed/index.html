		<description><![CDATA[This very minor exchange between us -- brief and minor -- already has given me greater insight into you.  I now better understand how you could have written the post you posted. The exchange is valuable.  Thank you. 


Let&#039;s try it this way.  I have posted my thoughts at: http://www.rabbidov.com/cuttingthegrass.htm   


It is fascinating that the same Pacific Jewish Center once was renowned as the shul where Rav Daniel Lapin was moreh d&#039;asra, and later where Rav Benjamin Geiger was rav.  Fascinating.  


Be well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would feel as upset as I would feel if an American bomb flattened one of the German 60% in Dresden who did not vote for Hitler.

This is a war going on.  There is a dead woman who was visiting Israel to mourn another dead woman and her dead husband, murdered four years earlier by Jew-hating Islamists who murdered them in India.  There is a war going on.  This is not &quot;Blazing Saddles,&quot; where the new sherriff, Sherriff Bart, hand-delivers a bomb to Mongo.  If Israel has intelligence that a murderer is in a car, or that murderers are storing or launching weapons from a hospital or school or apartment building, then Israel needs to excise the threat to its population.  If, while conducting its operations, Israel inadvertently kills unintended targets, that collateral damage is unavoidable.  Not only is there no other country in the world that fights with the same degree of heightened sensitivities, ethics, and morals as Israel.  There also is no other country in the world that is as aware as Israel that every non-combatant&#039;s death will be amplified by the enemy into a media circus.

		<description><![CDATA[Looks like California has a pretty consistent pass rate of only 42% over the years, if that&#039;s any consolation.

 http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2012/05/22/bar-exam-passage-rate-almost-unchanged.html
 
 (I presume) that if you looked more closely at that number, full time students make up the great majority of those passes, folks who had lots more study time under their belt that a practicing rabbi could not afford.

So what do you plan to do - if anything - with a law degree?
