		<description><![CDATA[To be dan l&#039;kaf zchus, maybe these organizations have done it in the past, and the non-profit exclusion is a new rule that they didn&#039;t realize was added. I couldn&#039;t find a copy of last year&#039;s rules on the AMEX website, but found the following on a website promoting last year&#039;s SBS:

Eligible small business merchants are independently owned small businesses located in the United States that accept the American Express Card. Purchases made at large or national chain stores, at franchised business locations and at government agencies are not eligible. Prepaid, Corporate Cards and ExpressPay transactions are not eligible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. I don&#039;t understand. Looking at the Facebook post, it seemed there was some lack of clarity about which rules were correct. Why are you looking at the rules for the advertising program?

2. I think there&#039;s another relevant category of organization administrators: Those that didn&#039;t ask AmEx but asked other organizations. I would assume that there are some who fit into that category. If they &quot;researched&quot; the promotion by discussing it with other administrators, and thus determined they were eligible, I think we can give them some leeway.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1) u should note that these &quot;donations&quot; are not tax deductible, so those who chose to do this are kinda shooting themselves in the foot (as my wife notes, to the extent $25 is a shot in the foot) and not getting as much bang for the buck as if they used the money for something they need (groceries etc.) and then gave a donation separately. not just moral, but common sense. 

2) Amex reps are told to make every customer happy no matter what. i forgot to use my $25 credit on saturday so i sent them a message. and they immediately just credited my account for $25 anyway! and many others got even more credit for forgetting to shop small (just google it). Amex is really customer friendly, but top level people there probably feel as a policy that charities should not be included.]]></description>
