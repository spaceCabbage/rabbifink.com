		<description><![CDATA[I was trying to say that .... most places in Florida don&#039;t have specific zoning laws against basements, but nevertheless, most developers are smart enough to not build them. I&#039;ve only seen one development around here where the developer advertised &quot;basement included&quot; for some of their models (and even those were probably half basements).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agree 100%.  But there&#039;s such a thing as common sense too.  Even if zoning allows you to do something stupid, you don&#039;t have to do it.  Don&#039;t people say they don&#039;t want the government to make decisions for them?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Building a basement on a barrier island is just plain stupid. But it&#039;s what happens when zoning is subject more to politics than to sense and science. Here on the Florida peninsula, there are hardly any basements at all, even in flood plain X zones! (and, trust me, we have plenty of political meddling in zoning laws, but some things are just plain old obvious).]]></description>

Naturally folks in that situation deserve massive amounts of help, but perhaps they will rethink their living situation once the shock of the storm is over.]]></description>
