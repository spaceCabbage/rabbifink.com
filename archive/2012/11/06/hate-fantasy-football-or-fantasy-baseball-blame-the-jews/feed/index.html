		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Sports are about athletic ability, skill, and strategy.&quot;

That may be what *playing* sports is about, and certainly there is similar appeal to the viewer/follower. But obviously there is more to it for the viewer/follower as well. I&#039;m sure you take in box scores, quote statistics, etc. So do FF players, they just turn it into a game (that also involves skill and strategy). Not everyone&#039;s cup of tea, sure, but &quot;hate&quot; seems a bit much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yawn-Fink at it again...I think looking at sports from an idealistic perspective is just silly. There is a term called &quot;lighten up&quot;. Sports is about entertainment, about having fun, about the ego (why else would you have a team), it&#039;s about competition and feeling like your team won. So why shouldn&#039;t that extend to fantasy football. I have never met someone who takes every minute of life scruptiously at a football game. By definition it is not meant to be over analyzed. Rabbi Fink, have a beer and relax...]]></description>
