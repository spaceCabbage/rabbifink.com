		<description><![CDATA[I guess Fink thinks that people of certain races (The Blue with Pink Stripe Race) are &quot;All&quot; needing special treatment and handling. Like they can&#039;t make it without special assistance. Like people who are handicapped. I have no problem with the handicapped getting to cut the line at airport security because I realize they physically cannot wait like the rest of us. They are &quot;special&quot; and should be treated as such. Standards are lowered for them. 

Is he saying that certain races/ethnicities of people are &quot;special&quot;? That they can&#039;t handle the world? They need affirmative action and special treatment because otherwise they are not smart enough? 

That&#039;s what it sounds like... comparing race to people in wheelchairs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a difference in regards to the the orphan and the person from the victim of racism.

*How often are these people screaming &quot;racism&quot; actually been victims themselves? Most are responding to a cultural or political mindset, rather than their own personal history. The orphan lost their parent themselves. They are the ones who have to live the rest of their lives without a parent.

No one being helped by affirmative action today went through slavery or the civil war. The applicants for college/grad school today did not even go through the days of separate sinks or public bathrooms. They were never in segregated schools. There might have been a time/place for it, but not in 2012.

That&#039;s the difference. 

Also, if you look at history- many many groups have been victims of racism in one form or the other. Just in America alone.... we have the: Irish Need Not Apply. The Japanese Internment Camps in WW2. Yellow Peril (Chinese and Japanese). Also look into the history of the Italians in America. 
Any benefits for them 50 or 100 years later?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a white person, I am not offended by the use of my race. I am, however, offended that people of ANY race who claim &quot;racism&quot; (at any time) feel it is ok and proper to label other people by their race. MLK said what? That we should judge people by the content of their character but not by the color of their skin???
I was talking with a non-white coworker about the election last Tuesday and she said &quot;Oh, I would never vote for a white guy&quot;. When I quoted for her MLK she kind of balked. &quot;Uh....but I still don&#039;t care. I won&#039;t vote for a white guy&quot;. She could provide no reasoning for her choice of president other than the color of their skin. 
I don&#039;t care if the candidate is black, white, or purple with green stripes. It is their character and what they stand for that makes me want/not want to vote for them. I don&#039;t even know the race of over half the people I voted for/against. The ones I do know- most of them made a big deal over it at some point in the election (or their previous term in office). 
Why must race be an issue?? In 2012 we should not even consider it. We are all humans. We (those voting) are all Americans. 

But remember, a wise person once said: Black people can never be called racist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Are you the same guy who moans and groans when people in wheel chairs get preferential treatment and can sit while they wait on line?!

Mamash dafuk. Your a rabbi, yet i sense a lack of wisdom. How about comparing apples to apples and not apples to Cadillacs. What does preferential treatment have to do with this? We recognize out of sympathy that someone on a wheel chair may require that sort of treatment. Are you saying blacks for example, require some special treatment to reverse the racism (and that we should be sympathetic to that preferential treatment as we sympathize with people on wheel chairs?) 

I believe it is quite irrelevant what a people went through in the past. As you would agree past persecutions of Jews does not give license to current anti-goy comments.

&gt;There are different standards for different kinds of people.



Exactly. I hold everyone to the same standards.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you so dense that you can&#039;t distinguish between common experiences of different people?!


I mean, when a WASP gets a deal, no one will take offense if you say he is cheap or frugal. But Jews get offended when they are called cheap. That is normal. Stereotypes and persecution play into how words are interpreted. There is nothing hypocritical or unfair about it.


Are you the same guy who moans and groans when people in wheel chairs get preferential treatment and can sit while they wait on line?! Or do you complain when people are nice to little children with but poor Holy Hyrax, nobody wants to play with you...?!


There are different standards for different kinds of people. Get over it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sigh. If according to Liberals, race is a sensitive issue in whatever manifestation it takes, than there is NO difference to its disgust if the &quot;elite&quot; class is doing it, or now, if the table is turned and the &quot;victim&quot; is doing it. It&#039;s either Right, or its Wrong.

If you want to use your orphan analogy than use it to its full extent. Clearly, its wrong to make fun of an orphan for his status. But that does NOT in any remote way make it right for the orphan to say&quot; Look, I have been a victim, now its my turn to give it to those kids with parents&quot;.

Tell me, do you say the same thing about Jews that look down on Goys? When some goy mocks a Jew, it is wrong, but when a jew does it, do you say &quot;look, one side has been persecuted, and the other was not?&quot; Or would you say, &quot;Yes, Jews have been persecuted, and there is still some anti-semitism. But that doesn&#039;t give license for reverse bigotry.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Honestly, I have no idea what you are saying. If you think race means nothing you should not care that the tumblr is called whitepeople... If you do care, you are being over-sensitive. Of course there is a double standard. One group has been victims of racism and one group has not. The same way you treat an orphan differently than a child with parents. OHHH!! DOUBLE STANDARD! ZOMG!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;I just find it hilarious when white people want the &quot;benefits&quot; of over-sensitivity.

You&#039;re not listening. I am not offended. Mark isn&#039;t offended. We are offended by the double standard coming from the side that is supposedly anti-racism yet continue to put race into everything and don&#039;t realize the double standard they are created. You really don&#039;t think the continue use of &quot;oh poor white people&quot; &quot;rich poor white people&quot; has no affect on the people, let alone on the younger generation that looks at this sort of crap? Do white liberals have such self hatred that they can&#039;t see this?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;As a white person, are you offended by the Tumblr?



I think one should be offended by the double standard and the constant need to throw race into everything. Was he just making an observation that there are more white people mourning? Fine. If its  JUST that, than there is no reason &quot;blackpeoplemourningobama&quot; should be offensive, since it is just stating an observation....that the vast majority of blacks voted for Obama. Thats all. Just an observation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;I made no such implication.&lt;/i&gt;

You kinda did. You said &quot;Maybe it has to do with the fact that non-whites are not too broken up about Romney losing&quot;. The real facts are that some non-whites were broken up and some were not. If the word &quot;some&quot; were included before &quot;non-white&quot;, it would be accurate and non-assuming of certain behaviors based on race.

&lt;i&gt;The facts are that 88% of Romney&#039;s voters were white.&lt;/i&gt;



This statement logically doesn&#039;t support your first sentence*. I&#039;m surprised that a trained attorney would make such a mistake :-)


* If, for example, 88% of all voters were white, it would lend no support at all. And even if less than 88% of all voters are white, it doesn&#039;t lend support to your earlier statement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Now, it SHOULDN&#039;T be that way.

Right. There isn&#039;t a &quot;but&quot; after that.

It&#039;s utterly disgusting that whitepeoplemourning is something that we can mentally spin that it is OK. Hey, the point of the post was to move forward. Ech. its just horrendous how identity politics is involved with everything in Liberal discourse.

&gt;But unfortunately we are not there yet.

Of course not. Thanks to Left-wing identity politics to consistently inculcate a generation that they are still victims. With this in mind, it will never go away and you will always find excuses for &#039;white people&#039; being accepted but not &#039;black people,&#039; without every thinking that this hashkafa IS affecting the next generation in how they perceive white people. I think like self hating Jews exist , there are a lot of self-hating white people (mostly Liberals) out there that find this to be OK (um, for now) in a way to help their self esteem for past wrongs.

		<description><![CDATA[You know, I really don&#039;t get it.

The reason it is not politically correct to categorize black people by their color is because they were persecuted, enslaved, killed, marginalized, feared, and hated simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Classifying people as &quot;black&quot; has a very negative connotation.



Now, it SHOULDN&#039;T be that way. But its our (non-blacks) fault that it is that way. The appropriate response is to avoid using language that might be offensive to black people.


The way it SHOULD be is that one SHOULD be able to categorize people by color without insinuating anything negative. It IS that way with white people.


So we should be striving to be able to do the same for other colors because that would indicate that we are past the horrors of racisms. But unfortunately we are not there yet. But that doesn&#039;t mean that where it is not a negative stereotype, one shouldn&#039;t use the appropriate word - white.


You make it sound like you are jealous as a poor white guy who has to put up with people categorizing you in a negative way because you are white. You know what? Go through generations of slavery and lynchings, maybe then you will have the right to be insulted by a generalization like &quot;white people&quot;. It&#039;s like an abled person wishing they had a wheal-chair.


As it stands now &quot;white people&quot; is not code and can&#039;t be code for any persecuted class. Black people is. That&#039;s the difference.
