		<description><![CDATA[One of (the main?) reasons for the chumra of kitniyot is that due to crop rotations practices in Europe (starting at the end of the Middle Ages) inevitably some wheat stalks would grow among the legume crops and anyone who bought legumes in a store in those days was bound to find some wheat among them (and if you cooked a bunch of beans it was likely to have some chametz). 


In other words it is possible that people only became likely to mix-up kitniyot with chametz starting 700-600 years ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Are there negative consequences to teaching children mythical beliefs that are known to be false? &lt;/i&gt;

 IMO yes, but I don&#039;t think Santa Claus necessarily falls under that categorization, since there&#039;s no religious dogma that mandates belief in Santa Claus.   In Judaism, I think there are negative consequences from presenting as fact midrashim that strain credulity.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great Post!   

I&#039;ve been saying this to my friends for a few years now  (never knew where and when the idea came from) but I have been calling it the &quot;Santa Clausation&quot; of Eliyahu. 

I think the next question to ask is:  Are there negative consequences to teaching children mythical beliefs that are known to be false?   When the Christian child learns there is no Santa, does it call into question the authenticity of other religious teachings?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s funny. I didn&#039;t think Elijah visited all of our homes for the seder.

		<description><![CDATA[600 years ago was 1412 during which John II of 
Castile declared the Valladolid laws effective that restricted the social rights of 
Jews. Among many other 
restrictions the laws forced Jews to wear distinctive clothes and denied them 
administrative positions. 

I therefor posit, that Elijah did begin to visit homes each year begining in the 15th century to make them feel better due to the persecution that had just begun and would of course end in the inquisition and expulsion. ]]></description>
