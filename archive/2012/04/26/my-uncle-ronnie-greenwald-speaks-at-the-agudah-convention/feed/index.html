		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t decide what I think about this. On the one hand, I commend him for standing up and saying his piece, even when it&#039;s not exactly the party line. He is blunt and honest, which is great. I&#039;m proud to be related :-).

On the other hand, it bothers me that he - like many others in the religious world - conflates the &quot;kids at risk&quot; issue with religious defection. What exactly does he mean when he says &quot;challenged&quot;? Is that synonymous with the general definition of &quot;kids at risk&quot; (e.g., http://nyyouthatrisk.org/) or does that mean kids who do not accept orthodox Judaism? Or both?

The two are completely distinct issues. Yes, they often overlap, but they don&#039;t have to. And while I recognize the need for (and support) the work he&#039;s doing for kids at risk, I do not care much for kiruv. 

I think that many in the orthodox world try to pretend that no one leaves orthodoxy unless they are unstable, mentally ill, on drugs, or stupid. This is patently false, and it bothers me. I believe it is simply a way of convincing themselves and their children that there is no good reason to leave. After all, if what you have is obviously so much better, anyone who disagrees must have some serious issues.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An amazing and timely speech. 

Unfortunately it is marred by your cynical introduction, especially the following 2 lines: &quot;The rabbis in leadership positions needed to hear this speech more than anyone else. Maybe you can send them the youtube clip to watch on their shmutz phones.&quot;

Does your negativity and cynism have to be injected into every one of your posts??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for the shout out :) For some reason that I cannot comprehend, he is not the featured speaker at everyone of these events! Why not go to the people in the field who have the experience? Daas Torah only works if you have knowledge of the matter. At least consult with them!!! ]]></description>
