		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve flown through Frankfort. I did find it creepy because the airport workers were so rude and cold and the waiting area was silent, you could hear a pin drop. Strange for an American. I was scared to do anything obviously Jewish. As an aside, I find it amazing that you didn&#039;t lose a single family member in the Holocaust. Both my parents are named after family members killed in the camps....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been to Frankfurt airport (and Frankfurt city) many times and it never felt particularly creepy. Sure I am aware that the very earth of the place is drenched in Jewish blood, but that is usually just a fleeting feeling at best. You say that you can understand how the irrational belief of avoiding German products could be passed to some people from great-grandparent to grandparent or to parents, and sometimes even further. Can you also understand how the irrational belief of Jew hatred could be passed to some people from German great-grandparents, grandparents, etc?

I also buy German products when their value (price/performance) is superior. For example, the Germans make the best knives in the world, so my kitchen knives are Henckels brand (the ones made in Germany, of course, not the inferior ones made in Spain or China).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rabbi,
Much passes from parent to child in terms of ideology, so I would not consider one&#039;s distaste for the german people as a whole irrational.  It took super duper hatred to be OK with what they did, and the german people as a whole kept on living.  So to say that none of that hatred was passed from one generation to the next is actually more irrational than to say it did.
