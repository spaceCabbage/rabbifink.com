		<description><![CDATA[So the average frum woman doesn&#039;t have a tough time with men as their yetzer hara? Are you for real? Have you seen what&#039;s been going on with teenagers, male AND female? Do you think its permissible for women to watch questionable movies/TV? They&#039;ve got a pretty darn strong yetzer hora. Shmiras Eynayim is as strict a commandment for women as it is for men, and for good reason. Give me a break. 

While perhaps Rabbi Fink was harsh in his descriptions, you aren&#039;t helping matters very much. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re blog is very nicely designed. I wish you much success. 
I understand your concern about &quot;excluding women&quot;, but if one were to give the issue a second thought they might realize that eventhough the issue is (as you said) about positive chinuch, one has to be wise and respectuful of whom they are teaching. You can probably appreciate that appropriate public inteaction between genders is a sentitive situation in our community, but desensitation for those who might be viewed as exhibiting oversensitivity is not (in my opinion) achieved by overwhelming people with an uncontrollable situation.
I beleive that one who seeks to teach in such circumstances has a lot to learn.
Good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot; 1) Please show me the signatures.&quot; Why do you want to see the signatures? Even if i would show them to you I have faith in you from what ive seen you write that youd twist your way out of that too in some fashion where everyone else- except you would realize what your all about. like you  might even say &quot; Please tell me why I should believe they are not forged.&quot; See, how did i know? Then if i were to prove that they werent forged the next thing youd probably say was: Who said they werent forced? So its obviously pointless. you said something stupid and your gonna say even stupider things to try and fix the first stupid thing. You and Shmuly Boteach.
Fact is you lied and said no one besides R&#039; Solomon is behind this based on the fact that you decided that all the signatures are forged ( and G.W. Bush blew up the twin towers himself). 
BTW rabonim have been having meeting about this for months. Hundreds of rabonim and gedolim. I suppose your probably gonna claim all the pictures of those meetings are forged too.
If everyone has a bias, which by the way is haskaficly against the torah, (but what do you care) I suppose you dont trust U.S. state and federal judges. and how about therapists. they&#039;re all biased, no? why should any couple go for counseling after all hes biased?
Bkitzur E your a piece of cake. Your a knock out with half my brain tied behind my back. you make shmuly look like a genius. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eliyahu, pardon me saying this but before you write things you should do at least a little research lest you make a fool out of yourself. 1.  I have seen at least 100 rabonim sign letters supporting this asifa. actually im having a hard time finding one rabbi that didnt sign. 2 there is no charge to go to the asifa. the only charge that they have is to attend the expo before the asifa. 3. Its great to hear the unbiased opinion about the issue from no one else then a blogger. Cant you a least admit that your opinion is biased? or are you too twisted for that too. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; One day you will be shown how wrong you were.
And it won&#039;t be pretty.
 
 
I used to live across the street from a church. The church van had a warning emblazoned across its side: “Accept Jesus or you’ll suffer in Hell.” 
 
I’m always fascinated by how all religions operate the same way. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ BGoldy, it seems you are missing a big point here.
The organizers still don&#039;t have a lineup of speakers. They don&#039;t even know yet what language the speeches would be in!
In other words, there are two issues here:
1) The goal of the Asifa (which everyone agrees with - keeping kids in the fold and off of bad web sites)
2) How it is done: (So far has been shown to be very ad-hoc, disorganized and not thought through)
See, when the Agudah does something on a large scale, a month before it is done, they have transcripts of each and every speech, they know exactly what will be said, since it will be said in their name.
The organizers of the Asifa do not yet know who the speakers will even be. Therefore, they can&#039;t possibly know what will actually be said.
The Gedolim who signed on, signed on because of the ultimate goal. None of them disagree with the goal of keeping kids off of porn, and neither does Rabbi Fink. 
However, they are not endorsing the actual proceedings, because they don&#039;t know what will actually be said and done!
What is Rabbi Fink is pointing out are the flaws of how it is being done.
Given the fact that they don&#039;t yet know what will be said, how can you say &quot;The Gedolim&quot; are behind the proceedings, when they don&#039;t know what they are endorsing?]]></description>

Rabbi Tendler, ztl, your rebbe, according to you, would be horrified if he saw what you wrote here.

I guess you are part of the anti-Gedolim crowd.

You have no other reason to trash them here in your post.

I tried.

You are too stubborn.

One day you will be shown how wrong you were.

And it won&#039;t be pretty.

I hope you make wiser decisions in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mayer - &lt;i&gt;I do not know, but I surmise that the reason for excluding women was to try to get the Chassidic community to attend. You are probably aware that many Chassidic communities have taken upon themselves extra chumros in regarding the seperation of the sexes. It is unlikely that there would be widespread attendance by Satmar chassidim if the event would have both men and women. &lt;/i&gt;

Are Chassidim coming to the siyum hashas (that is admitting women)?]]></description>

These are bold, brazen and harsh criticizing statements against daas torah. 

I want to pose a question for you- Who do you think you are? Just because you carry the label &quot;Rabbi&quot; gives you a right to bash R&#039; Mattisyahu, B&#039;Rabim????? How could you question real daas torah?

So far, the only person, let alone legitimate Rabbi, to publicly oppose this event is YOU, &quot;Rabbi&quot; Fink. You are a small, small human being. Very small. 

HOW DARE YOU RIGHT SUCH A POST???? OK, so while NIRC BOY, ESQ. above is a fiction (I wrote that post), it is a very real occurrence. No, I haven&#039;t known you for a long time, and I do not have 4 kids. We never shared a Rebbe, and I am not an Esq. But at least I have some Seichel. We all know the dangers of the internet, and how it ruins marriages and lives. We all know that the average frum guy, married or not, has dirty thoughts and has a harder time with the yetzer hara (nashim) than women. That should answer your question. Now remove your post. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow - Its good you aren&#039;t into hyperbole. &quot;There are a million and one things to complain about regarding the Ichud HaKehilos Asifa at Citifield.&quot; How about you enlighten us with just the first hundred thousand problems you have with it. 

I do not know, but I surmise that the reason for excluding women was to try to get the Chassidic community to attend. You are probably aware that many Chassidic communities have taken upon themselves extra chumros in regarding the seperation of the sexes. It is unlikely that there would be widespread attendance by Satmar chassidim if the event would have both men and women. If the goal of the Asifah is to generate a broad consensus of societal inteolerance to unfiltered internet access, then excluding a significant orthodox ideological movement would be unhelpful to say the least. However, excluding women could still result in the desired outcome of families deciding not to TOLERATE unfiltered internet. The husbands could discuss the Asifah with their spouses and perhaps they would come to a unified position on where they draw draw the line on internet access in their home. Do kids get cellphones? If so, at what age -  with data or without? Do the parents have accountability software? Can the children have Facebook pages. Do they block or allow streaming video sites such as youtube? There are a multitude of decisions that every parent and single adult has to make regarding responsible use of the internet. Having an Asifah with a broad ideological base can help communities come up with their own standards. 

I think it is helpful when talking about communal standards to use a real world example. Lets talk about mechitzahs. There is a very wide range of communal standards regarding the use and design of these. I am not talking about halachah - but rather what is considered normative within a certain community. Some shuls have  have a shoulder height divider  some have total seperation. Some communities will have a mechiztah by a vort or lchaim. Some will have men and women on opposite sides of a table, some in separate rooms and some have no division whatsoever. Some will divide families during shabbos meals at a sheva brachos and others will not. 

When one joins a particular community one will usually adopt the norms of the community. If all your friends and neighbors have a divider by a simcha, you would probably have one too. 

I think part of the purpose of the Asifa is to get communities thinking and talking about having a standard? Do I let my child play at a home of his classmate if I know they have unfiltered internet, or if he has his own laptop, DS, WiiI etc with unfiltered access. If every child in the class has an email address, is it appropriate for your 10 year old child to have their own? What will we as a community tolerate? Do we have a collective standard - do we try to say that we are an Am Kodosh and we deal with technology in a responsible manner. Isn&#039;t one way  to start a meaningful and broad based conversation about where we make our stand against the universally recognized danger of the internet to have a very public and heavily advertised event? (Look at how much conversation and debate the event has fostered even before it has taken place) 

I wholeheartedly agree that a one size fits all solution is inappropriate. Obviously a community like Satamar, where strict segregation of the sexes is the socially accepted norm will have a desire for very strict guidelines. And a community where people watch tv or movies will have a different view of what guidelines would suit them best (probably not a white list filter such as yeshiva net. ) Howeve, I dare say that few communities have given this enough thought to foster a meaningful social statement of internet limits. (Of course no Jewish community would tolerate pornography - but what guidelines does the community find acceptable?) 

Forget the taboo keywords &quot;assur&quot;, &quot;takuna&quot; etc.. What statement do we tell our friends, family , community and world regarding where we stand and what actions and sacrifices we are willing to take to protect our children and ourselves.

I don&#039;t understand why you are embarrassed to know me nor do I think anyone should be ashamed of me.

		<description><![CDATA[Eliyahu, I&#039;ve known you for a very long time- but now I am embarrassed for knowing you.  This post is a disgrace. Yes, Rebbe would be ashamed of you. And he should be. This gathering is not to forbid ANYTHING. It is to recognize that internet is here to stay and, therefore, it is something that must be dealt with. I watch porn. I do. I am married, 4 kids, I learn, have fun with my friends, chill, laugh, joke, shtieg, daven, klap al cheit......but the dangers are so real. SO REAL. And it is not only me. It is a large % of yiddishe yarai shamayim who are swept into the abyss of this horrific spiritual holocaust. I can&#039;t tell you how ashamed I am of myself. I daven to Hashem to help me be koveish my yetzer. This is not who I am. I don&#039;t want to be doing this. This asifa is most fitting for MEN ONLY. For it is the men of our Dor who are at risk. You should be ashamed of yourself. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Come one Eliyahu. The way you wrote this is PUBLIC bizayon for all the Gedolim who do support it. You are saying the project lacks leadership and vision, etc.

You vs. Rav Salamon and all the other Gedolim who support it. In public?Your Rebbe, Rav Tendler, ztl, who you wrote so lovingly about some months ago, would be embarrassed that one of his talmidim wrote this.If all you wanted to do was ask a question, why blog it?  Who are you trying to reach with your question?Call up Rav Salamon and ask him if you have this question.What is the true, sincere, leshem Shamayim purpose of what you wrote?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, Eliyahu, let&#039;s see what you have done with this post.

You publicly critcized and ridiculed Gedolei Yisrael.

Not exactly a mitzvah to put it mildly.

Whatever questions you have, I am 100% sure that Rav Matisyahu Salomon, one of the major supporters and leaders can answer them.

You are very wrong for posting this and you gain nothing by being so cynical except to be a &#039;hero&#039; to all the anti-Gedolim people out there.
