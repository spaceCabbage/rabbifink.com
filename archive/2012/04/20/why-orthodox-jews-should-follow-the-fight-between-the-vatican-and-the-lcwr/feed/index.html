		<description><![CDATA[Why do you say, &quot;We don&#039;t know and it doesn&#039;t really matter&quot; regarding the underlying motives? If it is simply a political alliance, alliances can change. If there is a concerted effort to institutionalize the Vatican&#039;s position on birth control on Orthodox Jews, that is a bigger issue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That seems in my opinion to be disingenuous as well. So because government already interferes we should just have the door wide open for them and let them come in as they please? But then again, we had this conversation and we know where we stand. ]]></description>
