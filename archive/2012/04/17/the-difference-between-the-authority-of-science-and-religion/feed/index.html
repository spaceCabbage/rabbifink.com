Also, there&#039;s a quote that I can&#039;t find that goes something like &quot;Any intelligent life that evolves on any planet will automatically have the astounding fact that the planet is perfectly suited to their evolution&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you want to see evidence (not proof) of the truth of Judaism, read &quot;Living Up to the Truth,&quot; by Rabbi Dr. Dovid Gottlieb at http://ohr.edu/992.

Yes, you should insist on some evidence before believing that something exists, but you don&#039;t need 100% proof. 

As for your last paragraph, think of it this way: Assume that only one planet in the universe is home to life forms (I have no idea if it is or not). Wherever that planet might be, in whatever galaxy, it would be hard to imagine that it could be special enough to be worth putting life on. Every planet is a backwater planet; every galaxy is unremarkable. But life does exist here, and that makes it a remarkable place. And perhaps God takes an interest in other parts of the universe as well and has always done so. Would that make His existence any more palatable to you? Why should a divine being set a universe in motion if He isn&#039;t going to take any interest in it afterwards? That deist approach sounds a lot less logical to me. Would you bake a cake and then walk off and ignore it for all eternity?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[
Summary because this got long: You don&#039;t have to prove that something doesn&#039;t exist, the burden of proof is on the person making an assertion. It&#039;s why (ideally, though sadly not always) you are innocent until proven guilty in American courts: the prosecution must proove that you committed a crime, and not you having to proove that you didn&#039;t. 

I contend, then, that the evidence that God exists only appears that way because you have a previous knowledge of God. 

You think that Zeus is a ridiculous concept, because we know where lightning comes from...there&#039;s no need for a god of lightning when we know it&#039;s from a sudden transfer of charge between the clouds/ground. 



If you went into a remote village of people who have never had any exposure to modern religions, you may find they worship tree gods or what have you. And you&#039;d think them silly for doing so. What makes their gods silly and your &quot;real&quot;? I suppose you could take the angle that &quot;it&#039;s really all just the same god&quot; in which case I&#039;d be more willing to go along with that. 

To say that atheists need proof that God doesn&#039;t exist is like telling me I have to PROOVE to you that there&#039;s not an invisible unicorn standing next to me that only I can see, and it&#039;s kisses can cure cancer and AIDS. I could insist all I wanted that my unicorn exists. I could go to a cancer ward and some people there would recover and I&#039;d say it&#039;s becauseÂ my unicorn kissed them, and that that&#039;s evidence that he exists, but you&#039;d never believe me. 

You&#039;ve confused the null hypothesis, which would state that to prove something against what is the default position. You really can&#039;t PROOVE something doesn&#039;t exist, which is why it&#039;s nearly always the default state. 

If you want to get into strict philosophical semantics, of course it&#039;s POSSIBLE that God exists, and you&#039;d have to find a really dense atheist to not admit that. I don&#039;t think there are too many gnostic atheists who will claim that they KNOW beyond any doubt that god does not exists...because that gnosticism is just as arrogant as a theist claiming that they have absolute knowledge that god DOES exist.

My bottom line is that a kid raised completely apart from religion will not develop anything remotely like religion as it exists today, but they&#039;ll notice that balls drop and the sun comes up and goes down. He&#039;ll invent reasons why those happen, and maybe it&#039;s a giant man in the sky pulling the sun across on a chariot. 

It&#039;s like Bill O&#039;Reily...he said &quot;the sun comes up, the sun goes down. The tide comes in, the tide goes out. You can&#039;t explain that!&quot;...when clearly we can explain both of those. 


Just to kinda of give more insight into my perspective, I was raised Jewish, and I still consider myself Jewish. However, I don&#039;t really put any stock into religion anymore, though I am very protective of my Jewish heritage and culture. I would suggest to someone that the universe may have been set in motion by a divine being, but I don&#039;t believe that an infinitely powerful being that controls the entire universe spent a bunch of time ordering around a tiny fraction of the population of a backwater planet in an unremarkable galaxy during the blink of an eye on universal time-scales. There are a lot of good morals and ethics to be learned from the Torah, but Rabbi Hillel summed them up quite well while standing on one foot, and that teachings doesn&#039;t require that you have faith that it matters what you eat or if you cut your beard.

		<description><![CDATA[I think you&#039;re missing Stanley Fish&#039;s point. As I understand it, he was saying that science is handicapped by being necessarily based on unprovable assumptions and theories, and that we have to recognize that. Obviously, we all rely on science (as a religious friend of mine once said, &quot;I believe in science. I take elevators&quot;). But bear in mind that until Einstein, certain scientific &quot;laws&quot; were believed to be always true. They were also testable and verifiable -- but not accurate under certain conditions. 

Several &quot;sciences,&quot; especially the &quot;historical&quot; ones (e.g., cosmology and paleontology -- significantly, the ones that religious people often have a problem with), are based strongly on speculation rather than proof. There is no way to prove scientifically what happened at the beginning of the universe. What physicists are trying to do is to prove what might have happened based on a re-creation of the supposed conditions at the time. But those conditions are themselves unprovable and certainly what might have resulted from them is unprovable. All that can be done is to show what might have happened. 

Yes, many believers consider the text of the Torah to be proof of religious truths. Obviously, this won&#039;t convince anyone who doesn&#039;t already believe in the Torah. I think one big problem is the Christian emphasis on blind faith and personal feelings of salvation. People therefore assume that Judaism, too, is based on blind faith, whereas actually it has a much more solid foundation. There is evidence that God exists. Not proof, but evidence. And there is no evidence that God doesn&#039;t exist. The most atheists can do is come up with ways things could have happened without God. That certainly doesn&#039;t prove anything. The world could exist without me, too, but as far as I know I exist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you drop a ball on the earth at sea level, it will accelerate downward toward the centre of the earth at 9.8m/s^2. Every time. We don&#039;t totally understand exactly how gravity works, but we&#039;ve found that there are certain things that are true about it and are testable and repeatable. 
Â 
There&#039;s a quote, I think by Feynman, that very roughly paraphrased, goes like &quot;Scientists love uncertainty, and love mysteries, because if they solved everything then there&#039;d be nothing left to do&quot;. It&#039;s unlikely that you will ever find a serious scientist that doesn&#039;t allow for uncertainty. Statistics was invented to show that for a given set of data, you&#039;re only certain within a specific percentage. Scientists use words like &quot;suggest&quot; and &quot;correlate.&quot; It&#039;s only when the local station starts reporting about it that suddenly &quot;scientists PROVE such-and-such.&quot;
Â 

Compare that to Religion, where I can&#039;t think of a single repeatable experiment you could do, other than that shuls will ask for donations at the high holidays, which corresponds to the days when they have to move the walls back to make room for the congregation that they don&#039;t see the other 362 days of the year. Yet many believers will tell you point blank that God exists, with their only evidence being that the Torah tells them so.
