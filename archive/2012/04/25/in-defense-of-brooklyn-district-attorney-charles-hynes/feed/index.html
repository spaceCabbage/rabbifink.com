		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, I generally enjoy your writings, but I strongly disagree with this piece.  Your theory in defense of the DA is presumptuous, and not based on the facts on the ground.  Unfortunately, it is very often that names of victims are revealed and spread within the community regardless of the DA making the defendants public or not.  This is often done by the protectors of the accused offender in an effort to intimidate the victims.  To the victims and their families in this situation, it is (most of the time) extremely important that the offenders be publicized, because at the very least, this gives them some security and comfort that people are aware of the ongoing legal procedures (which can take years), and that the offender is known publicly as a possible danger to children.  The DA not releasing the accused offender&#039;s name only makes it easier for the people that are blackmailing and threatening the victim, giving them the power to release the information within the community at their discretion -which leaves the victims even more powerless than they already are in a corrupt system.  With this policy, Charles Hynes is in fact protecting the offenders, and not the victims of abuse. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Brooklyn D.A. is not a one-man legislature.  Statutory law gets made by the two houses of the democratically elected NYS Legislature in Albany - the 150 member Assembly, and the 62 member Senate.  A bill gets passed, and the Governor signs it, or vetoes.  The D.A.&#039;s thin basis for not disclosing the names of arrested orthodox sex crime defendants is NY Civil Rights Law section 50-b(1) which states as follows:  

&quot;§  50-b.  Right  of  privacy;  victims  of  sex  offenses  or offenses  involving the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus. 1.  The  identity  of  any  victim  of  a  sex offense, as defined in article one
  hundred thirty or section 255.25, 255.26 or 255.27 of the penal law,  or
  of   an   offense  involving  the  alleged  transmission  of  the  human
  immunodeficiency  virus,  shall  be  confidential.  No  report,   paper,
  picture,  photograph,  court  file or other documents, in the custody or
  possession of any public officer or employee, which  identifies  such  a
  victim  shall  be  made  available for public inspection. No such public
  officer or employee shall disclose any portion  of  any  police  report,
  court  file,  or  other  document, which tends to identify such a victim
  except as provided in subdivision two of this section.&quot;This statute is utterly silent about keeping the names of arrested defendants confidential.  The D.A. has no legal authority to add language to the statute that does not exist, nor to give the statute a meaning that was never remotely contemplated by the state legislature when this law, then a bill, was first proposed, debated, passed, andsigned into law by the Governor.  Additionally, not one commentator has pointed to any other D.A., in our nation, that has ever acted in a similar fashion.  This Brooklyn D.A. has, thus, usurped normal democratic powers reserved for the legislature and the voters.Rabbi Fink, you may feel that the Brooklyn D.A. is right, notwithstanding that he and other D.A.s can begin to withhold the names of other sex crime defendants who originate from other religious and ethnic communities, notwithstanding no legal basis to do so.  The difficulty with your point of view is that it is totally non-democratic and authoritarian, and that is one of the underlying reasons why our community has this sex abuse problem in the first place.  ]]></description>

But it &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; put the community on notice to keep an eye on the guy and to raise the level of protection they provide to the typical victim population.

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; E Fink - &lt;i&gt;Huh? I agree simply because I know that releasing the names will harm the victims further.&lt;/i&gt;

And NOT releasing the names will probably create new victims. Which choice is worse?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you basing your opinion against Hynes solely on the Kolko case?   From what I recall and not withstanding &quot;reporting&quot; in the Jewish Week, the case against Kolko and the testimony against him was weak (not saying he didnt do it, I think he did all of it and more, just dont think the case was in the bag for the DA), and he basically walked as a settlement.  Regardless, even so it doesnt even imply Hynes is in the bag for Chassish/Yeshivish (plus there&#039;s no real connection between the 2 groups $ wise).  Maybe accused molesters walk all the time in Brooklyn, I don&#039;t know but I don&#039;t think you do either.  

I&#039;m still not sure I necessarily understand the correlation of naming the accused leading to naming the victims, even in tight knit communities.  If god-forbid this happened to my child when I could have known about the predator I dont think I would take that very well.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One thing about the community. It seems to me that a rape is actually the lesser of two evils, if the other evil is open public discussion on rape or sex.
Many people in Monsey did end up hearing about the Bais Rochel girl who was raped in the story above, only after the second incident on that path.
I felt infuriated when a police officer told me that the night before the rape, there was a meeting between police officers and Rabbonim, in which the Rabbnim were urged to warn girls to stop using the path.
It seems consistent throughout, the recurring theme is no matter what happens, we must avoid the Chilul Hashem that negative publicity would bring.
It does seem unfortunately accurate to say that publicity would stop victims from coming forward.
If no Chilul Hahsem would result from an abused child coming forward, their parents would be more likely to support them in coming forward and telling their story.
If the names would be released, there are many within the community who would sacrifice justice for their children in the name of &quot;the community&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Philo - &lt;i&gt;The community probably meted out their own brand of justice.&lt;/i&gt;

I have to wonder though. Maybe they didn&#039;t mete out justice and instead quietly moved him to a different unsuspecting community and just &quot;hoped&quot; it wouldn&#039;t happen again.

What kind of justice are you imagining that they meted out?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course they do. No parent wants to have such a horrific thing happen to one&#039;s child.

But the community leaders also desperately want to protect the community&#039;s reputation. And they see arrest by the police and the attendant publicity as being some sort of chillul Hashem. And people in Chassidish communities are used to obeying their leaders.

I doubt that the alleged rapist in this case got off scot-free. The community probably meted out their own brand of justice.

I&#039;m not excusing the community in any way - it&#039;s a sick and diseased system. I&#039;m just explaing what I think is going on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;&quot;
Fix the community and justice will follow&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

The community won&#039;t be fixed internally. The legal system needs to bear down and only in response to pressure will the community be changed.

I don&#039;t know whether this decision was correct or not. It&#039;s very hard to judge given Hynes&#039; past history.  But certainly more needs to be done. With the names kept secret, how is there accountability on whether the DA&#039;s office is actually prosecuting these cases seriously?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your analysis would have more merit in a vacuum. But this is far from Hynes&#039; first instance of protecting the Chassidish or Yshivish communities.

		<description><![CDATA[you are right on with this one. Unfortunately, Very often, in &quot;the 
community&quot;, the more publicity to a &quot;situation&quot;, the more it is 
squashed.
True Story:
A girl in Monsey was raped because certain 
&quot;power brokers&quot; decided that frum girls should not be exposed to the 
word &quot;rape&quot;,  so the decision was made to not publicize an attempted 
rape that took place in the shortcut in the woods behind Pathmark.
The very next day, a Chassidishe girl was raped on the shortcut.
But...
 the story gets even better. Between the time the family called the 
police and the police got there, the &quot;leaders&quot; of the community were 
called (by the family), and they compelled the girl to give the police a
 false description of the rapist. While the police were looking for a 
Hispanic man in a baseball cap and blue jacket, the Chasidishe rapist 
was whisked off to Florida.
As an aside, another tremendous Chilul 
Hashem was caused when Chaveirm saw a Hispanic man that fit the 
discription and made a &quot;citizens arrest&quot; on a completely innocent man.
A Ramapo Police officer, who was a client of mine, complained &quot;How can we protect you from rape if you won&#039;t let us?&quot; ]]></description>
