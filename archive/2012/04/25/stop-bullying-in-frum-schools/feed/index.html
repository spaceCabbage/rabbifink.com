		<description><![CDATA[Great point. I think that there is a difference between the way girls and boys are bullied. Boys are more physically abused and more explicitly verbally abused. It is a lot easier to see it and a lot easier to prevent. Girls bullying in orthodox schools is more surreptitious and therefore harder to monitor and prevent. It also seems less damaging (even though it is probably more damaging in reality) so it will be focused on a bit less. 
But I agree, and hopefully this program will be implemented in girls schools as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s more than being called short.  The child is made to feel insignificant because of his size.  I know, I was once that small boy.  Your comment is quite insensitive.  I do not doubt that this boy will contemplate suicide at one point if this pattern continues.  I have had more than one short boy confide in me that at some point in high school the pain was too great that they contemplated suicide.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank G_d that my son was willing to go to high school after being bullied for 7 years in a heder in Lakewood.  The school there finally did something after this kid attacked one of the Rebbeim.  They sent a great message to my son; If your father is a Rabbi, and your parents pay full tuition up front, you can pick on anybody you want, except the Rebbeim.  If you are on scholarship, we won&#039;t do anything for you!

It is unfortunate, but the Yeshivish Yeshivas lag behind the MO Yeshivas with regards to anti-bullying!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice video. I hope it works.

Bullying truly is a problem in yeshivot (and probably in all schools). It was a problem 40 years ago and it&#039;s still a problem today.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Several schools have excellent policies in place (such as http://www.bethtfiloh.com/ and http://www.halb.org/).  I know because I&#039;ve researched it our own school.  Still waiting to for them to be trailblazers in Chicago.

This is super important issue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looks good to me. 

My quibble is in regards to discipline. So some kid is called short and feels bad. Then what? Is all bullying equal? I don&#039;t think so. ]]></description>
