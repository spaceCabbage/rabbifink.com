		<description><![CDATA[Why do you think it will be of less interest than Amish in the City or any of a hundred + reality shows that aired, of every conceivable topic? 


It seems like many people on various comments thread have been reacting (hoping) this way: &quot;No one will care.&quot; No, I don&#039;t think anyone will, just like no one cared about most reality shows which did air - but air they did and air they do. Why is this premise any less compelling?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s probably safe to assume that whether it be a Reality Show Or a Docudrama, some of said drama will be manufactured. If you read my comments above, I&#039;m not aginst this show, I will likely watch it, but its never 100% real. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the compliments. I mean it. And thanks for stopping by and commenting.

When a show is being promoted as reality show then I can assume that is what it will be. If it is a docudrama then it should be promoted that way!

I didn&#039;t assume it will be like the garbage that is usually associated with reality TV, I simply said that reality TV is a lazy way to tell a story and it rarely comes out as good as the stars think it will.

I can only write what I feel. If the show turns all these assumptions on its head, I will be happy to write about it success. Good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All right, Fink. Sometimes you talk nonsense.

I read your blog occasionally (not an endorsement, just a fact) and I mostly enjoy it. You&#039;re civil, and about as open-minded as I can expect from a frum Jew.

But to pile all reality television together and label them all &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;train wreck television&quot; goes to show how little reality TV you watch. Of course there&#039;s &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; and &quot;The Real Housewives of Botox County&quot;, but there are also docu-dramas like &quot;Intervention&quot; on A&#038;E and &quot;Circus&quot; on PBS. Yes, there&#039;s a reality show on PBS.

You further went on to assume that our show will be like &quot;Keeping Up With The Kard&#039;ASS&#039;ians&quot; and the like, and that is something you simply don&#039;t know.

You are more thoughtful usually. I&#039;m just surprised.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;
their new ex-hasid community&lt;/i&gt;

Is there really such a thing as an &quot;ex-hasid community&quot;? What makes them a community? Do they live in the same place? Do they share the same beliefs? I think they aren&#039;t a community, I think they are just a group of people with one thing in common, being ex-Chassidim.  Some remain in the NY metro area, some move away. Some remain orthodox, some become secular (and the rare few join another flavor of Judaism). Some publicize their story, most do not. Some maintain ties to their old life, some do not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[there is nothing redeemable about about Snooki, we&#039;re just there to watch her have sex (yuck) and get drunk (yuck). 

Pearlperry is there to grow as a person and discover what we all know already. I think if they do it right, it can be an &quot;inspirational&quot; type show like on lifetime or something, not an MTV madhouse. ]]></description>

Still I dont think you&#039;re right :)

The general public would love to see how people escaped a cult and are adjusting or not to the real world. they are heros, no matter how bad they seem. in the view of the masses they are doing the right thing. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;  I can only assume that the stars of this show have never seen reality TV shows &lt;/b&gt; 

I dont think this is right. Twersky (i think the son of the skver rebbe in brooklyn) is a TV consultant, its safe to assume he owns a TV. and as far as Palperry and Shauli Gross go, they arent living in Lakewood anymore, Im certain they are familiar with TV as well. 

&lt;b&gt;I can only see how this show will only harm them and their new ex-hasid community. &lt;/b&gt;

Harm Them: ok, maybe. 

Their ex community: I dont think they care, and they&#039;d likely be happy about that. ]]></description>
