		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Lastly, some people consider social media an inherent “danger of the Internet.” This is a fallacy. Learn how to use the tools properly and it can be a wonderful and positive use of the Internet.&quot;

I used to use Facebook like once a month until I saw that filthy images displayed in the ads are unavoidable and even people on the friend list can post disgusting images on your &quot;wall&quot; or what-have-you... in any case it popped up on my screen. What are you going to do, use FB w/o images turned on? Please. I&#039;ve deleted my account. As should we all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Non-sense! if they want to educate the lay people they should send a booklet and accompanying DVD in the mail (MUCH CHEAPER) to explain what internet is and how one can protect themselves and the family from the bad part of it. They can also create a Internet Gemach to help people out with advise and filter installation.
This whole stadium thing and the thousands of dollars that is being wasted is just a scheme of political and marketing propaganda and is of zero value to solutions and helping individuals.Why does the word &quot;Call of Gedolim&quot; make me want to vomit? I&#039;ll tell you becuase its usually used ONLY in negative events to FIGHT something, can we stop fighting always something else and start serving Hashem????! Its not the &quot;Gedolim&quot; who are leading the public, its the &quot;Ketanim&quot; who are misleading the gedolim and the public, our society will go down in the gutter if the  &quot;Gedolim&quot; continue to be led by those &quot;Ketanim&quot;, its time for Torah to rule, not people of calculations and and honor grabbers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I heard that R&#039; Chaim Epstein and R&#039; Shmuel Kamenetsky are listed as signatories. I also heard that they never signed it. 
I heard from a charedi rov today that he does not know a single rov or baal habos who thinks this asifa is a good idea. That includes the people who supposedly signed it. 
Some rabbonim even hold it is mutar to forge a signature for a &quot;good purpose&quot;. See: http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2012/01/20/of-fault-lines-and-forgery/

		<description><![CDATA[You dug deep to try and prove the supposed chilul Hashem which there wasn&#039;t at Huffington.

 The asifa will be a Kiddush Hashem and a gathering for tefila. No reason for anyone to be against it.BTW, unlike you, I don&#039;t do the waste of time called facebook. Email is plenty enough for me.I almost never do the comments discussion thing either but did here to try and help you and your ruchniyus but in the end I failed in that due to your stubborness.]]></description>

To some, the availability to read video game reviews on the Internet is bad enough, almost on par with pornography.

		<description><![CDATA[Eliyahu, your haskafos are so messed up. You caused any chilul Hashem if there is any. You brought up the issue of no women publicly and went against the Gedolim. I see from all your comments you really did not do teshuva so I was wrong with what I thought about you this morning.
How can you write this against the Gedolim? &quot;t&#039;s far from perfect and it&#039;s unfair for you to say that the organizers are all sincere and the critics are all insincere.&quot;
Gedolim=sincere.
Critics have no reason to criticize any asifa that is l&#039;&#039;shem Shamayim and can only help. Thus, critics=insincere.
I wish Rabbi Tendler, ztl, were alive so he could yell at you and set you straight.
All I can say about how messed up you are right now is a big nebach.

We can never advance as a nation with all the disputes among us.

Be grateful that a few individuals are funding this is event and putting a big effort into making it work. So far it&#039;s the only plan we&#039;ve got. So stop whining and fussing about minor details and get on board.

		<description><![CDATA[True. I&#039;d recommend Puppy Linux, though, if you&#039;re trying to run off a flash drive. You can set it up with persistent state and all, and the drive needn&#039;t be all that large.


Point is, trying to fight with your kids is, more often than not, going to end in you losing. Unless you&#039;re a super-geek, expect your kids to be better at this than you are. Decide what it is that you consider wrong, and try to teach your kids to appreciate that. If you can&#039;t do that, you might want to rethink what it is you consider wrong.

I still don&#039;t quite understand what the dangers of the internet are. Porn? Kefira? Neither of those things strike me as all that bad. Obviously, children should be taught basic safety tips, like not meeting strangers in person, etc. After that, what&#039;s so bad?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But if these people will only learn in this convoluted manner, so be it!  

Come on. This is absurd, and you know it. I&#039;m going to assume that the people behind this thing are not stupid people. If they were interested in educated non-technical people about how to use the internet in a safe manner and how to protect against the &quot;bad&quot; things on the internet, they wouldn&#039;t be doing it this way. 

The reason they&#039;re doing this is because their goal is not education, and you know it. Their goal is to make a powerful statement, one of fire and brimstone.

And as you said in your post, it misses the mark. They&#039;re addressing the symptom, not the problem.

		<description><![CDATA[From my comments to R. Fink&#039;s Facebook share:

&quot;So develop a handbook and guidelines, and pay some of the many, many frum computer technicians out there to run local classes to teach charedim how to use the internet effectively and safely; they could even teach them about various beneficial sites and uses while showing them how to avoid the dangerous/bad ones. Hmmmmm, teach people in an actual educational setting and give many people some parnassa while your at it, at far less cost, with far less meaningless fanfare, and far more effectively, and for men and women, too! What an idea. &quot;

And:

&quot;Sorry, R. Fink, this will be the rare occasion where I have to strongly disagree with you take (though I understand your position, and think its a reasonable one). Needing to do something is no excuse for doing something stupid, wasteful, and ineffective that merely perpetuates many of the ill that have led to the chareidi internet issue in the first place - the notion that a dais of gedolim can declare to the rest of us without any indication that they understand that which they are regulating. They did this once and banned the internet, and it failed; instead of correcting the process, they are just changing the position, with no reason to believe that the new position is any more in touch with reality or more nuanced and effective than the old discredited view.&quot; ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is sincere.

I have been assured that the gathering is simply to help people protect their families from porn. Do I think it needs to be at Citifield? No. Excluding women? No.
