We have communities who do that. Notably, the Jewish Press readership does that.

I haven‚Äôt heard any claims that their marriages are better, that they
 have a higher marriage rate, that they have more successful dating, or

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi,
There&#039;s no gentle way to say this, so I&#039;ll just say it.¬† Women and men have different standards when it comes to finding a mate.¬† Men who have their choice of partners, as should be obvious, prefer youth and beauty.¬† Women who have their choice of partners prefer a man with high status.

If some men are designated as &quot;top&quot; or otherwise high status men, and they know they have their pick of women, they will almost always choose women who are the youngest and the prettiest.¬† That&#039;s just how men are.¬† Women who are so pretty as to have their choice of men will almost always choose the men with the highest status.¬† It&#039;s called &quot;hypergamy.&quot;¬† It&#039;s not nice, but it&#039;s real.¬† You can say it&#039;s a manifestation of the yetzer horah.¬† I wouldn&#039;t disagree.¬† (Of course, if you&#039;re going to condemn men for their type of hypergamy, THEN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, CONDEMN THE WOMEN AS WELL FOR THEIR VERSION).¬† I&#039;m sick and tired of hearing men being blamed for being shallow when, women&#039;s hypergamy is just as shallow.

Maybe the problem, when it comes down to it is designating some boys as high status.¬† This makes them more likely to be picky.¬† (The girls know exactly who&#039;s high status just by looking at one another).

Anyway, I see no solution.¬† Maybe Halberstam&#039;s solution is awful.¬† I rarely see a 19 year old woman who&#039;s genuinely ugly, and to say that so many of our 19 year old women are ugly that it&#039;s causing a &quot;shidduch crisis&quot; is obscene.¬† I do notice young people gaining weight.¬† This is not primarily due to gluttony and sloth.¬† It&#039;s due to bad advice about diet.¬† (See the movie Fat Head for more details http://www.imdb.com/video/hulu/vi230135833/¬† )

Now, I&#039;ve been an advocate for low-carbohydrate diets for some time now.¬† I advocate it for general health (I can supply references that it&#039;s a healthier diet to back up my point).¬† Anyway, I say we make our young people healthier by encouraging them to restrict their carbohydrate intake.¬† And as a side benefit, many will lose weight and become more attractive.¬† It might not be nice to say that weight loss can make a person more attractive, but, well you have to deal with the reality of the human system of sexual attraction.¬† It&#039;s just there.¬† Why make things more difficult?

That solution is not a magic bullet.¬† But hey, it might help somebody.]]></description>

There&#8217;s no gentle way to say this, so I&#8217;ll just say it.¬† Women and men have different standards when it comes to finding a mate.¬† Men who have their choice of partners, as should be obvious, prefer youth and beauty.¬† Women who have their choice of partners prefer a man with high status.</p>
<p>If some men are designated as &#8220;top&#8221; or otherwise high status men, and they know they have their pick of women, they will almost always choose women who are the youngest and the prettiest.¬† That&#8217;s just how men are.¬† Women who are so pretty as to have their choice of men will almost always choose the men with the highest status.¬† It&#8217;s called &#8220;hypergamy.&#8221;¬† It&#8217;s not nice, but it&#8217;s real.¬† You can say it&#8217;s a manifestation of the yetzer horah.¬† I wouldn&#8217;t disagree.¬† (Of course, if you&#8217;re going to condemn men for their type of hypergamy, THEN FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, CONDEMN THE WOMEN AS WELL FOR THEIR VERSION).¬† I&#8217;m sick and tired of hearing men being blamed for being shallow when, women&#8217;s hypergamy is just as shallow.</p>
<p>Maybe the problem, when it comes down to it is designating some boys as high status.¬† This makes them more likely to be picky.¬† (The girls know exactly who&#8217;s high status just by looking at one another).</p>
<p>Anyway, I see no solution.¬† Maybe Halberstam&#8217;s solution is awful.¬† I rarely see a 19 year old woman who&#8217;s genuinely ugly, and to say that so many of our 19 year old women are ugly that it&#8217;s causing a &#8220;shidduch crisis&#8221; is obscene.¬† I do notice young people gaining weight.¬† This is not primarily due to gluttony and sloth.¬† It&#8217;s due to bad advice about diet.¬† (See the movie Fat Head for more details <a href="http://www.imdb.com/video/hulu/vi230135833/¬†" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/video/hulu/vi230135833/¬†</a> )</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;ve been an advocate for low-carbohydrate diets for some time now.¬† I advocate it for general health (I can supply references that it&#8217;s a healthier diet to back up my point).¬† Anyway, I say we make our young people healthier by encouraging them to restrict their carbohydrate intake.¬† And as a side benefit, many will lose weight and become more attractive.¬† It might not be nice to say that weight loss can make a person more attractive, but, well you have to deal with the reality of the human system of sexual attraction.¬† It&#8217;s just there.¬† Why make things more difficult?</p>
<p>That solution is not a magic bullet.¬† But hey, it might help somebody.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Why do we have to argue about¬† which system is best? Why should it be either/or? Sure, the system works for most people. But are the others expendable? Which is more important: the system or the people? If each individual is important, then there have to be options for the ones this system doesn&#039;t work for. The shidduch system may be the most efficient, so I wouldn&#039;t throw it out, but other ways of meeting have to be allowed so that the minority can also get married and have families. 

On the other hand, I don&#039;t think the emphasis on looks and thinness would be obviated if young people met naturally. Eating disorders are not an invention of frum society. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Your numbers are off. Regardless, it is a crisis. You don&#039;t have to take my word for it.&lt;/i&gt;

Perhaps. So what are the numbers? Are more than 10% remaining unmarried?

And it&#039;s not a matter of &quot;word&quot;, it&#039;s a matter of quantifying the problem before tossing away the entire system and replacing it with another system that may or may not work better. And that may or may not have¬†unforeseen¬†consequences and costs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; E Fink - &lt;i&gt;Undeniably, there is a crisis.&lt;/i&gt;

Any evidence for this assertion? Seems to me that 90+% get married using shidduch system. Do you think that the number would be greater than that with the system you are proposing?

However, I do support the system you are proposing, but for different reasons.

guest - &lt;i&gt;Who will be the one to decide they are appropriately &quot;mature&quot;.&lt;/i&gt;

The way it works is that the people themselves decide. They begin mingling once they are mature enough to do so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am curious. what does it say when an OTDer like me got married to an intelligent, good looking man on his way toward career success while dating him in jeans and just enough makeup to cover come acne? Granted I had no weight to lose so I had that going for me but still, not like my nose is a button one. There is no doubt I have a catch and all I had to alter about my appearance was the zit thing.  If the frum world is supposed to be a spiritual one where did these guys get the ideas they have in the first place about what women should look like? No jean skirts now? The women are not getting the same messages as the men about appearance in the shidduch world when in the broader world women are certainly interested in men&#039;s appearances in almost the same way men are about women&#039;s looks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[great article. Interestingly, your description of the guys&#039; &quot;corruption&quot; resonates with descriptions I heard from single girl ¬†friends here in the Israeli modern orthodox community. Though they mingle freely with eligible men in social or religious events, many of the men are extremely callous, never pursuing the girls beyond the first conversation, always expecting a &#039;better catch&#039; to show up, spoiled by the supply and demand conditioning the scene. which of course makes one wonder if it is really the shiduchim system failing....or something far more basic and general in our society, in our different¬†expectations¬†from the two sexes, in the ways we value girls and boys. I would be interested to hear your take on those deeper issues. Are they even solvable?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think the flaw in your reasoning is that the guys figure they can always wait for the next batch of 19-year-olds. I&#039;m not saying age is the only reason for the shidduch crisis. And the system does ultimately work for most people. I&#039;m actually less concerned with the 19-year-olds than with the minority who it doesn&#039;t work for at any age -- the people who will never find anyone if they have to decide (and be decided about) in a high-pressure meeting in a hotel lobby. There are lots of people who have to get to know someone without pressure, in a slow process, and that is not an option in shidduchish circles. So those people are left single, even though they&#039;re actually very nice, capable, normal people who make a perfectly good impression on the people around them. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sadly, there are worse things going on behind the scenes. ¬†Parents of daughters are now expected to contribute up to $50k per year to their daughter and potential son-in-law if the daughter wants to marry a learner, or even a boy from a top yeshiva. ¬†I know a father who was told by a Rosh that since his daughter didn&#039;t have a profession (wasn&#039;t it just yesterday that we were being warned against sending our girls to university?) that he and his wife would have to agree to support a prospective son-in-law indefinitely (in the range of $25-50k per year) in order for his daughter to date a boy from his yeshiva.
How is a young man ever supposed to view his wife as a Ashes Chayil if her family has to pay for her to be married to him?!¬†
The Torah gives marriage to the man. As the brilliant book &quot;The River, the Kettle and the Bird&quot; points out man needs marriage in order to grow close to Hashem. ¬†Women do not need marriage (or a bris) and are therefore considered complete. ¬†Man is incomplete without marriage. ¬†Therefore, points out the Rav, it is the man who is to make the effort to make the marriage work--for his own spiritual growth and development.
What is going on with shidduchim now is undermining the very purpose of marriage and sabotaging
another generation of young men. ¬†That this is being supported by prominent U.S. Roshs is heart-breaking.
