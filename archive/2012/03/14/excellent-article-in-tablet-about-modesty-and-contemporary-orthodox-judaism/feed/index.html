		<description><![CDATA[I found your blog thanks to Heshy...I also live in LA but in the valley. This article is what I felt in many ashkenazi orthodox communities, which made me gravitate towards Chabad. I was able to become more frum through Chabad and the community&#039;s open-mindedness and the fact that they don&#039;t scold me when I wear a hat that doesn&#039;t cover all of my hair. Not to say all the ashkenazim are critical and all chabadniks are good, but it is what I found in my experience.

As a woman who studies halacha, Torah, and Talmud (OMG, scandalous, I know), when people are critical of my observance, it turns me off. I grew up as a staunch conservative Jew but became more observant and realized that wasn&#039;t the way. It was hard trying to be observant where the only observant Jews would be critical of my observance! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ Is it even a lapse? Only if the pants are really forbidden by halacha. Some loose pants are more modest than some skirts. So is it perhaps not a lapse but a statement made while remaining within halacha? Sounds to me like she&#039;s making a statement to people that she can&#039;t handle their rules anymore while telling God that she&#039;s still loyal to His rules. 

The quickest way to send her off the derech would be to tell her that she&#039;s already there. ]]></description>

But it’s not an OJ thing, it’s a human thing. We need fast and dirty ways to determine whose part of our group. We can see at a glance what a person is wearing, we notice which places he frequents. We don’t usually ask people for their business records so that we can determine if their honest.

		<description><![CDATA[Avital&#039;s article is well written, and sadly accurate; and your comments resonate within me. The only issue I have with this post and with many other posts on this blog, is that I agree with the majority of the views expressed in them. This is no fun. The good news is that there is plenty to read elsewhere on the internet for a healthy dose of increased  blood pressure and heart rate. Joking aside, I really enjoy reading your thoughtful words. Thanks. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062; To say that clothes make the man more than honesty is symptom of a very sick society.
 
Not really. Who is considered part of the club of Orthodoxy (and the subgroups therin) has nothing to do with keeping halacha per se. It’s about social identifiers. If someone exhibits the identifiers that say he is part of a community – dress, involvement in the community, going to the right shuls and schools, etc. – then he is. That he’s dishonest doesn’t make him non-Orthodox, it just makes him a member of the club who’s not living up to club standards. 
 
Changing what you wear is changing something that identifies you as a member of the club.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a modern orthodox (married) woman who wears skirts and pants. Some people would look at me and think that I&#039;m &quot;off the derech&quot; but frankly, my &quot;derech&quot; isn&#039;t coming to or from 19th century Poland. Yeshivish dress is still dressing like goyim, just from 200 years ago. I would choose to dress like Sara Emeinu over Polish nobility, which was one influence for my (now removed) nose piercing. For me, that was a statement; it said &quot;Rivka and the holy women who donated their gold to the mishkan all had nose piercings. I&#039;m not emulating shtetl life. I&#039;m emulating our emahot.&quot; So put me in Cherem. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So if a woman wears pants once (or even occasionally), she is off the derech. And that&#039;s because &quot;they are neither halachically or socially acceptable&quot;.

Therefore, the Spinka Rebbe is also off the derech. That&#039;s because cheating and stealing is &quot;neither halachically or socially acceptable&quot;. And he used to not cheat and steal and then one day decided to do so.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As far as your post, I liked your last paragraph, but I completely disagree with you about that off the derech woman. Wearing pants is forbidden. If she chose to make a public statement that she is going to wear something which is widely accepted to be forbidden in the Orthodox world, then she&#039;s not just saying &quot;oh I woke up this morning and the pants looked inviting.&quot; She knew exactly what she was doing. Of  course it says something. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In my opinion, Avital&#039;s article is a mixed bag. Some of her themes, that modesty must be modest, the tznius inflation (as you call it), the neuroticism, are very valid. But some of it is bothersome. Her friend didn&#039;t ask what denier tights the shidduch prospect wore. Her friend wanted to know if she wore anything...because that&#039;s halachic territory, and that matters. She is now a Modern Orthodox woman, which plays by different rules and that&#039;s fine. But that&#039;s the thing: she&#039;s playing by different rules. Sure there are plenty of problems, but the solution doesn&#039;t necessarily require moving to the left. And her solution is not applicable to the right.]]></description>
