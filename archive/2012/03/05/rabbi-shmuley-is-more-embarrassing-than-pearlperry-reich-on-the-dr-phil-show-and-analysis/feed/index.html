		<description><![CDATA[Its alot more  than different wave lengths here! Regardless,  when one has children u  can&#039;t  just  decide,   u don&#039;t  like   your  religious. life , its too. much for u etc....that is completely selfish,  there  are  others involved, u  have a responsibility as.a parent!  what women or men  like Pearl Reich  do is irresponsible for a start !   She  is  living  with  her boyfriend, how can u  call  that  observant?! She dresses  like a shikse, a woman  could wear pants and still look modest.  Whether one wants to  lv  orthodox Judaism or all of it? Don&#039;t  bring  your  kids  down with  it  to  try  to &#039;legitimize&#039; your excuses! to &#039;prove &#039; u are a good.parent, u want  your children,u  are NOT . A good  parent  doesn&#039;t  do  this..
 I  have  no  doubt  these  kids  will  grow up   cofused and  kids  at  risk. I  speak  from experience   with  an  ex  spouse  like  this,  even  worse. Thankfully. he  didn&#039;t  hv  much  to  do  with my children when  they were younger,  however ,  they  still  encountered problems in their teens as a direct  result of  his  actions amd. behavior. If one  thinks  that  their  kids  will not  be tremendously harmed   by  such  actions,  they  are GROSSLY MISTAKEN !!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are many Jewish actors and models, ranging from totally secular to Orthodox (Mayim Bialik). It  should not be considered a problem for a Jewish woman to be an actress and/or model. Otherwise, what do you propose those born with these talents do--just pretend they don&#039;t have them? Forcing someone to deny their talents and gifts causes nothing but trauma and grief. There is a long and proud history of Jewish theater and involvement in the performing arts. Don&#039;t these talents come from God? As an actress, singer, and writer, I would rather be dead than be denied the chance to express these parts of myself. Think of the tremendous agony it would cause young women (and men) if they had to essentially kill a part of themselves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the real issue is that Shmuley Boteach is running fro congress, and how is he going to be able to save face as the ultra orthodox jew with the beard and have respect from his colleagues in congress if they think ultra orthodox is wacked out. When the american public hears romney is a Mormon, the first thing they think of is polygamy. He&#039;s run a campaign for over a year of just plain ordinary people going about their life and then saying &quot;I&#039;m mormon&quot; so that the american public isn&#039;t frightened by that religious stream. Boteach has the same problem. Where do you think he intends to get money for his campaign.... not necessarily in the orthodox Jewish world.  Its says alot about Shmuley -- what sort of congressman will he make? Will he just lie and cover up to fit the times, to go with the flow, to protect his own job? IS he willing to be controversial at times other than only when it suits him, i.e. selling more books? Did he do all in his power to enable Perry maintain custody? He, of all people knows a campaign needs money and so does a custody battle. Perry is now saying she doesnt have the money to continue her battle after the beit din an lawyers sucked close to $60,000 already. And she still is before a trial-- which will cost tens of more. Shmuley knows what divorce is about-- all the women in his immediate family (other than his own kids) are divorced. Why doesnt Shmuley at least help Perry get a decent job so she can support herself?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[rabbi fink your as modern orthodox as can be believed 
you dont understand chassidic dating stop acting like you do
do jews around the world a tova and meet chassidic girls and guys before there
weddings youll see that there not as stupid as you think 
youll see there not forced into anything 
and that they like the lifestyle and dating that there parnets set up for them, and 100% are not forced into it im speaking as a married man with about 250 chassidic friends who I have spoken to about this and they all not brainwashed but free thinkers say they like what was step up in the society
It takes an outsider to really spread lies and crazy cases where half information is given to write the things you wrote.

Does that invalidate chassidic dateing and marriage no!
 Peoples  community&#039;s have the right to date marry the way they want to, you as a person have the option to get out. And you Pearl are wrong for committing to marry and bring up children, then leaving that lifestyle.Shes basically not orthodox at all, right after this whole marriage goes bad magically shes not orthodox  pieces of this puzzle dont add upif you want to attack the ultra orthodox world, because your no longer religious at all that should be considered an attack]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hate the way Rabbi Shmuley tries to placate Ms. Reich by watering down &amp; distorting our religion.

To paraphrase: &quot;I don&#039;t care if you wear pants, just be a good mom to your kids.&quot;
&quot;No problem for a Jewish woman to be a model &amp; actress&quot; - I will give him the benefit of the doubt that he didn&#039;t actually see the lewd photos of herself posted online (I unfortunately did.)
&quot;Judaism encourages a woman to advance in her professional career, I have 6 daughters and hope they maximize their potential&quot; - really now, you would have no problem if your daughter decides to be a swimsuit model??

Shame on him for kissing up to her and kudos to the very visibly modern-Orthodox fellow in the audience for standing up for the truth and pointing out the double standard this troubled soul of a woman is trying to rationalize as normal.  May G-d protect her kids from her and bring a wave of repentance in all our hearts.]]></description>

&#8220;Judaism encourages a woman to advance in her professional career, I have 6 daughters and hope they maximize their potential&#8221; &#8211; really now, you would have no problem if your daughter decides to be a swimsuit model??</p>
<p>Shame on him for kissing up to her and kudos to the very visibly modern-Orthodox fellow in the audience for standing up for the truth and pointing out the double standard this troubled soul of a woman is trying to rationalize as normal.  May G-d protect her kids from her and bring a wave of repentance in all our hearts.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[So lets see. You rip Shmuelys’ book even though you admit you havn’t even read it. You praise Pearl even though you admit “I don’t know any of the details of Ms. Reich’s life or her situation.”
Here’s what you don’t grasp sitting thousands of miles away. It is alleged that Reich’s lifestyle is a complete horror show.  Forget the religious aspect. That’s the tip of the iceberg. The completely impartial court report recommended she not get custody. Do you realize how rare that is? Not joint custody. No custody. Why do you think that happened? They felt she was a completely unfit mother, and it had nothing to do with her lack of respect for religion. It had EVERYTHING to do with her current lifestyle, or which you know zero. I’m constantly amazed at people like you that print out their opinions online without even having a modicom of facts at their disposal. Do yourself a favor. Find out the real story before you post nonsense.
Thanks for playing!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In the general society, 50% of all marriages end up on the rocks. Most of the people on Dr. Phil&#039;s show or shows like his are not Orthodox or Ultra-Orthodox.
Falling in love before marriage does not result in happier, more stable or longer term relationships. While it is true that the first five years of &quot;shidduch type&quot; marriages are more difficult, the long term prognosis for &quot;arranged marriages&quot; or &quot;arranged dates&quot; are actually overall happier and more stable.
That is not to say that there is not a trouble in the Haredi community; there certainly is -but troubled relationships run across the board - that is why self-help books &amp; programs are skyrocketing.

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; does he care so much to establish how it is or is not in orthodox Judaism? Because his book is predicated on a make -believe version of Jewish marriage.
 
I got the impression that he was doing damage control for the frum community. But maybe you’re right, and it was more base than that. Maybe he was just trying to protect his book sales.
 
&gt; Rabbi Shmuley also lies in front of the entire world.
 
Yeah, almost everything he said was a lie.
 
&gt; as if Rabbi Shmuley never heard of the insular communities of Williamsburg, New Square, Kiryas Joel, or the less insular but still similar communities of Boro Park and Lakewood.
 
Not to mention Crown Heights. Isn’t he a Lubavitcher?
 
Another fun moment was at the beginning of the show when Rabbi Shmuley accused the other guests of being anti-Semitic. Apparently in his world, any criticism of a Jewish community is anti-Semitic.]]></description>

Did you read the recent pieces in the Israeli media on Ger chasidus? &lt;/i&gt;

Yes, I read it. They&#039;ve gone around the bend already.&lt;i&gt;So how do I know that Reich&#039;s life was so awful and she&#039;s just not playing to stereotype to get an advantage in court?&lt;/i&gt;There is no way to know if she is playing for court or not, but no doubt at least part of what she is doing is playing for the court. But that isn&#039;t what matters. What matters is what the judge thinks and if you look objectively at Chassidism in general, it shares a number of traits* with traditional cults. And if the judge agrees, by all rights, he should remove the children from the confines of the cult as soon as possible.* Look at this list (it&#039;s a list that appears in similar form in numerous places, I just picked this one because it&#039;s numbered) - http://www.prem-rawat-talk.org/forum/uploads/CultCharacteristics.htmMost Chassidic sects have 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 14 strongly. And 3, 10, and 12 moderately.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excellent points about RShmuelie...what made it even worse was that he embarrased the South African fellow that earnestly called her out for being a model when in fact this fellow actually had the guts to tell it like it is. What R Shmuelie did was be &#039;megaleh panim shel Torah shelo kihalacha&#039; which is very, very serious. That said, Ms. Reich and her boyfriend were incredibly disingenous as well... I live in Monsey and know people that know both of them and they are far from being Orthodox in any shape or form....Lastly I think that you go a bit too far...I think that most people in the system are hhappy...based on what I know and they are some changes that have occurred..She&#039;s def from the most extreme ranks that don&#039;t allow any choice...Her boyfriend by the way comes from a terible background...father was a drug addict..and thats not the worst of it]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely agree.  Did you read the recent pieces in the Israeli media on Ger chasidus?  Scary stuff.
However, just because some Chasidim are like this does not mean that all Chasidim are like this.  I know a Gerrer couple, for example, who are completely unlike the stereotypes the media reports on.  So how do I know that Reich&#039;s life was so awful and she&#039;s just not playing to stereotype to get an advantage in court?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow you really missed the boat on this one. R&#039; Shmuly is much smarter than you think he is. He had one agenda on going on that show (OK I&#039;ll grant he had a secondary agenda of self-promotion) which was to stress that while this is a terrible situation, it is not as wide-spread as pearl or her boyfriend would have the world believe (boyfriend actually mentioned hundreds of thousands of people like him which is patently and facially absurd). Nor is this situation, while sad, an intended outcome of members of the ultra-orthodox community. That is what he stressed and he was emphasizing that this is not the way in orthodox jewry not to promote his book, but to explain to the world that the orthodox community at large does not practice in this way, nor do they approve of this practice. 
Give the man a little credit. He did a pretty good job.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ Deemer,
I married a 19 year old.  We waited to have kids.  I&#039;m saying that as full disclosure.  But that said, I can easily see how a year or two can turn into ten.  It&#039;s just so easy without kids.  Kids are just such a hassle...

I don&#039;t know if opening that door is going to, on balance, benefit the community.  Now, my individual case was a success.  We waited.  Now we have three beautiful kids, and one kid who&#039;s sort of funny looking (I&#039;m kidding about that, but we do have four kids).  Anyway, when you take the aggregate statistics, I just wonder what would happen if that suggestion became policy.  I have little doubt that trips to the fertility clinic would increase.  After all, that&#039;s what happens with thirtysomething secular people who wait to have kids.  Why should orthodox who wait to have kids have any different results?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read your article  and i see your point ...i am sort of in this situation, i am chasidish ultra orthodox, i got married at 19 and have 2 kids with a guy i am not satisfied.. its been 4 years since im married, if i look back i defintly see changes on him and feel better..and you do need lots of help. but wait now think a bit holy , hashem wants something from us,we should fix each others and work out our midos, take someone that is not so good and make him good, take a person you didnt love and start loving him, once you accomplish some of this it feels great!         ( im not talking from ppl that actually hate and didnt want each others at all from Begining, i mean that if it was only my choice i just would  not choose him )
 im not here to say that ppl should be forced to get married young, but i can say that its good to be married young and you should encourage it, getting married young makes you mature, getting married young makes you love the one you got its all about being a good person and willing to work out things.. its an amazing avoida .

another point it is false that all ppl dont know anything about outside world, maybe some.
I knew everything before i got engaged i  was fully ready, thanks to my parents who never hid anything from me and always prepared me for the future..
 all i can say is that parents take the responability of these rebellious kids, if a kid is open with her parents and knows whats going on she wont agree to get married when she doesnt want, its her or her family problem and not orthodox Judaism. period!

		<description><![CDATA[I watched the show and know the modern-Orthodox man in question, who is upset because he said that his response/replies were heavily edited on the show.

In general, though, this woman is behaving as if no one has difficult divorces and custody battles except for her, and it&#039;s all Judaism&#039;s fault.  Her ex is fighting her over their different lifestyles, as if no one who isn&#039;t Jewish ever battled their ex in court for having different viewpoints in bringing up their children.  

High-conflict marriages end in high-conflict divorces.  End of.  By ridding herself of some of the anger, she will present a better face to the court and will be heavily favored towards custody rights, she will spare her children some unnecessary grief in an already bitter battle, and she will find that her life seems fuller.

I thought their advice was spot on.  Ranting and raving about how the world has it in for you, and how your parents and family and friends are to blame for everything might be correct, but it doesn&#039;t let you move on.  And it certainly screws up your kids in an already awful situation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ Karen, 
I didn&#039;t see the episode.  I barely know who the players are (except for Shmuley).

Anyway, about the advice &quot;Get rid of the anger.&quot;

I fully accept that this may be the worst advice in the history of advice.

But it also might be the best way to make the best of a bad situation.  Maybe her life has been made bad by having too many kids, getting married too young, etc.  All of that probably stinks.  But what can she do about it?  Leave her husband and family?  Leave her husband and take the kids?  Turn to drugs or alcohol?  Make a big stink in her community about how unjust it is?  Some combination of all of the above?

Suffice it to say that all of these courses of action have drawbacks.  Some of them have major, life changing and dangerous drawbacks.

I cannot say how the future would be for anybody, no matter how well I knew them, as they choose which way to turn on the forks of life&#039;s road.  Maybe &quot;getting rid of her anger&quot; and accepting things the way they are offers the best chance of long term contentment with the least risk of making things worse.

Then again, maybe not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ I wonder what the effects of that would be in the long term?  Female fertility tends to fall a lot more quickly than people would guess.  A woman&#039;s fertility drops by about half by the time she&#039;s 27.  I bet a policy like that would have a lot of unintended consequences.]]></description>
