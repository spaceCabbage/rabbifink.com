		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t go for all the numbers you provided because every couple and situation is different. My general guidelines would be as follows:

1. Don&#039;t start dating until you&#039;re ready.
2. Don&#039;t get engaged until you&#039;re ready.
3. Don&#039;t get engaged to anyone you don&#039;t like.

Seems obvious but there is SO much pressure and hysteria out there. Parents and rebbeim should not be pushing their charges into anything.

		<description><![CDATA[hi my name is chaya nechama and I&#039;m askanazie. I like your comments a lot. I&#039;m just wondering how much education men from these Chasidic groups get in general in how to treat a wife. I&#039;ve seen several cases now where the men treat their wives really badly, mostly just by disregarding her, and using her almost like a servant but not showing her that he finds her delightful. I&#039;ve seen this be terribly painful for a woman to not see her goodness in his eyes, to not feel that he likes her all that much. It&#039;s terribly lonely and feels like a rejection. Women need to feel loved and we are willing to do all the other things, the laundry, the dishes, the endless chores, the food that miraculously appears in front of you at a Seuda... the cleaning for Pesach, caring lovingly for the children.... I love doing all those things IF I am loved. If Im not loved, all I can think is what am I doing this for?
My friend is now intertaining the idea of divorce and she&#039;s talked to me a lot about the reasons which essentially come down to this: she says, &quot;I just don&#039;t think he likes me all that much.&quot; She works so hard, she tries to be a good person, and I love her, but she&#039;s lonely in her marriage. And I just think it&#039;s such a waste. I&#039;m not trying to generalize, and maybe it&#039;s that some guys don&#039;t think this is important. Her husband treats her like she&#039;s not all that important to him. There should be some way for women dating to be able to determine if the guy will be able to provide the emotional connection that all women crave and need. Women need to be found delightful to their husbands just like children need to feel that they delight their parents. Huge emotional scars that never heal happen when they don&#039;t get this.  I hope its ok that I wrote this, I don&#039;t mean to offend anyone, but it seems like such an obvious thing and so easy to give and yet so hard for some people. And getting into a marriage with such a person would almost definitely end either in divorce or a scarred for life woman and children...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think my second point - and i apologize if it wasn&#039;t clear - was that in my opinion R&#039; Broyde would disagree with your characterization of Bateini Dinim &amp; the Beit Din of America in particular. I think we (purposefully ambiguous) have to create a dichotomy that distinguishes between those batei dinim which have experts on such sensitive and often politicized topics and those who don&#039;t. I think we both essentially agree on that. Please correct me if I am misunderstanding you. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With all do respect Rabbi, I don&#039;t understand why you think that the rabbi&#039;s don&#039;t understand the complexities of those situations. To clarify a bit: I am not saying that all Batei Dinim are qualified, but that some -  and I would put the Beit Din of America in that category - are qualified (and not under-qualified). From someone who has read many of the works of R&#039; Michael Broyde, I think he understands the exact complexities that you say Rabbi&#039;s don&#039;t understand. I believe I heard from R&#039; Broyde (although i don&#039;t want to be quoted on it) that in cases with such complexities, Rabbi&#039;s who are also lawyers are always on the beit din for that exact reason. If the Batei dinim were so out of touch, there arbitration&#039;s wouldn&#039;t hold up in secular court. Batei Dinim are given their legitimacy from the fact that their awards can be collected if brought in front of a secular court.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Correct, I misquoted, but my point is the same. The words &#039;discuss intimacy&#039; are very vague. When was the last time you sat down with your wife to &#039;discuss intimacy&#039;? not your average discussion for the married couple, all the more so for two people who have never been intimate before.

The focus should be on ensuring both were educated by qualified teachers who stress the meotional and physical needs, not only the halachah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the burack - &lt;i&gt;
violating negiyah that early will lead to a lifetime of lack of control during niddah&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;will lead&quot;?!!!??? Since a large percentage of frum youngsters have violated negiyah, you&#039;re basically saying that a large percentage of frum couples violate niddah. This is NOT a fact, you are wrong and need to rethink this issue.

Hint: It is far easier to control oneself when having regular sexual activity (regular meaning a few weeks every month) than after a lifetime of no sexual activity at all, and 5 to 10 years of that after sexual maturity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some assumptions you have made are inaccurate:
Your definition of Chasidic dating is wrong. Couples can meet as many times as they want. In fact, it is well known that Ms. Reich dated her husband as many as 10 times before they married (in spite of her claims to the contrary). I wonder if you based this on what she said in the interview?There are numerous girls, even within the secular world, who get married before 19. I know some myself.If people find each other compatible from the outset, there are some serious tznius issues with dating simply for the sake of dating. So, to decide that a couple must date for a month and no fewer than 10 times is quite unnecessary.

That the couple should meet the night before the wedding is out of place according to halacha. As a Rabbi I am surprised you even mention this option.

With regard to family planning, children a precious gift from Hashem. Even when one hopes to receive a gift from a human being, lehavdil, it would be odd to say to the benefactor: &quot;Presently, I am not interested in receiving your gift. When I will be ready to change my mind - I&#039;ll let you know.&quot; I was married for 5 years before we had children. When children are born, the woman changes alot and the dynamics are entirely different. It&#039;s better to learn communication and love in a setting that will continue for the rest of your life, ie when children arrive.

Your other ideas are very good. I strongly believe that neither spouse should be the spiritual advisor. But I do believe that both husband and wife should have a spiritual role model of their own with whom they discuss their yiddishkeit, this is paramount as when one is slipping, one often needs a hand to be helped up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What percentage of yeshivish couples ends up in a bad divorce or bitter custody battle? I&#039;m saying what I would like, as a yeshivish woman. For the most part, the yeshivish couples I know have gotten engaged when they were happy with each other and liked each other and were excited about a future together. Why wait to get married? My primary reason for liking short engagements is more because I have been told and have seen that couples just end up getting nervous. Engagement is hard enough as it is. No reason to prolong it.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The get should not be withheld at all&quot;.  Unless I&#039;m missing something about withholding a get being encouraged by leaders or Rabbonim that statement seems a little strange.  Isn&#039;t it generally a weapon (mis)used by a husband even iver the objection of the Rabbonim?  All the changes in the world won&#039;t stop spiteful and angry men.  

That being said I like your direction, and that small incremental steps, approved and encouraged by Chasidish/Charedi leaders is the only way.  The questions is do they recognize that there&#039;s a problem.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think social dating is the answer. Perhaps a more liberal attitude towards boys and girls at a Shabbos table or the kiddush in shul is in order. 
Birth control is less assur than it was when you asked. Things are changing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting that you do not address the pre-dating age.  To go form never talking to women, they are assur, sexual creatures, must be covered up, cant look at them, to instant fun and exciting conversation is not viable.  In my view.  Also, to expect some of these guys to wait 3 months before closing the deal is unrealistic.  The main reason he is getting married is to do the deed and procreate,  he may burst before three months is up.  Also, birth control is assur.  Only one with a specific heter for their particular situation can receive one.

I remember asking my (ner israel trained rav) for a heter for BC.....i was 30, wife was 28,,,,,we had 5 kids...he said no.  So i ignored him and never asked again.]]></description>
