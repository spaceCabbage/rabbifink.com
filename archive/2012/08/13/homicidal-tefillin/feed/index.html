		<description><![CDATA[You do realize that you are arguing with a Sofer about how his job is done right?  Rapidograph pens and other nifty fountain pens, in including the etsofermaher(
http://www.ole.co.il/etsofermahir.html) are in use by sofrim all the time.
As far as the ink penetrating the ink, all good sofer&#039;s ink does.  The Mishnah Berurah, that you cite(actually the M&quot;B 32:8 not 32:3) if read in it&#039;s entirety goes on to state that.  The same with the Kol Yaakov 32:11 and 32:12.  Minhag sofrim according to the Kesset HaSofer and the Kol Yaakov is to use ink that will remain and not be easily erased.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Write, a metal quill. I thought that a pen in the classical sense was different, even a fountain pen. I remember being told of a Rishon (forget who) that wrote a Sefer Torah using a piece of metal, but this was criticized because metal essentially can scratch through the parchment.


As far as the ink goes, one of the criteria is that it&#039;s easily erasable/fixable, this is in the MB on Shulchan Aruch Siman 32:3. If the Klaf absorbs the ink that&#039;s bad as it can never be fixed then, hence kuma or kankantom not being  allowed to be used by themselves, but only when mixed with ash (ash makes the ink when dried more brittle and easier to scrape off when a fix is needed).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeriat Shlomo(it&#039;s a text I have readily at hand) 4:32 
מעיקר הדין מותר לכתוב בקולמוס ברזל
My translation, &quot;According to the essential halakha it is permissible to write with a metal pen.&quot;  
Then dropping down to his moreh mekomot: Darkhei Moshe EH&quot;E 125:102, Rema Sh&quot;A EH&quot;E 125:4, Other&#039;s say it as well.  

As far as the ink, Kol Yaakov on Sh&quot;A O&quot;C 32:4.  Kesset HaSofer 3:1, I don&#039;t remember where exactly it is in the Mishnah Berura, Yeriat Shlomo 3:1.  So long as it is black and made from ingrediants that are completely kosher it is technically kosher.

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I received my Tefillin in E.Y. from Baalei Yiras Shamayim, and from the little I understand about Safrus, using a fountain pen is not Halachically permissible as it doesn&#039;t &quot;move&quot; when the wind blows. A reed when it grows does that and Chofetz Chaim states that a feather also blows, which is the case.

Where is it Halachically permissable to use a fountain pen? Also, what other opinions are there besides the gallnut juice mixture of 3 ingredients as specified in the MB?

I think that in this case, it may moreso be chalked up to &quot;wear and tear&quot; after 15 years. Then again, maybe I am being a bit naive.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The thickness of the ink really has nothing to do with it.  I know that is the myth passed around the water cooler but really it&#039;s just not the case.  
It really comes down to the quality of workmanship that goes into the scribal process.  You probably think that your Tefillin were written by some guy bent over a table using a feather(or preferably a reed) and an ink well.  
Where the truth of the matter is, unless you specified that specifically in your order that is most likely not the case.  
They were most probably written with a fountain pen, and since iron gall ink plays havoc on a fountain pen because of its corrosive(and thus penetrative) abilities, they have used an ink that is not halakhically preferable(though still meeting the most basic levels of kashrut).  Resulting in your letters cracking.
See a guy with a feather will need 2.5-3hrs to write a single mezzuzah, a guy with a reed 3-4hrs.  Break out one of these nifty rapidograph pens, and you are down to 1.5hrs..
Since safrut is mostly a volume business... The number of sofrim who use traditional, and honestly better, methods of writing are dwindling.  You still pay top dollar for an inferior product.
The same is true as to why you will get Tefillin or Mezzuzot with letters touching.  Even though it is halakhically preferable to have them checked by at least two people other than the sofer, and preferably three, that costs money.  When the competitive starting price for a set of Mehudar Tefillin Gassot is $500, klaf costs $10, Batim cost between about $300, then each person checking those parshiot costs $40, if I go through three of them, that&#039;s $120.  Leaving the sofer assuming he&#039;s writing with a feather, a measely $70 for 20+hrs of labor.  That averages to $3.5 an hr.  Who do you know that wants to work for that.   So they scimp.  Hey look there is a lenient opinion that says I don&#039;t need to have anyone but me check it... well that saves me $120... That gives the sofer an immediate hrly pay raise of $6/hr.  Throw in using a fountain pen to cut down on writing time, and you get the problems you had with your Tefillin and a decently paid sofer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark that is the primary cause of cracks.  The ink should penetrate the klaf, so technically the letter shouldn&#039;t be able to crack, if the ink was made al pi halakha.  When you erase a letter you actually have to remove a layer of the klaf, depending on the quality of the ink(and the self confidence of the sofer) that could be anything from a few microns all the way to nearly the entire width of the klaf.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sometimes we look at pain as a punishment, and many times it is, but especially when the &#039;punishment&#039; seems out of proportion to the particular &#039;crime&#039; we are associating it with, it helps to remember that Hashem is Merciful and kind. To feel that, it helps to remind ourselves that there is more to our existence than this world alone, and what is painful now can help us be better off later.
(To apply it here: maybe it&#039;s better for the father to suffer such a tragedy, which will ultimately save him from going his whole life without doing the mitzva of Tefilin.
It&#039;s a small piece of the puzzle, plus there&#039;s still the question of why the children deserved it)
To ascribe sadistic intentions to Hashem, as it seems some of the comments did, is a sad mistake (see scripture).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Note: When a series of tragedies befell my family last year, we had my Tefillin and our 8 Mezuzahs checked. The result? 3 out of 8 mezuzahs had problems and from my Tefillin, 4 out of the 5 parchments had problems. Thankfully everything was fixable, but still.


While Tefillin don&#039;t have magical powers per se, it&#039;s still very important to have them checked as wearing Tefillin that are Pasul prevents one from properly fulfilling the Mitzvah of Tefillin, which nonetheless leads to Divine punishment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Barukh HaShem.

And that these punishements were, as the holy books said, solely coming back on the sofer.  I am so happy to know, being a sofer, that my unsuspecting clients, and not me, are responsible for my sins.

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; So it seems incongruous
that a missing word in the tefillin would have such a drastic effect if it was
an error when if one violated the Shabbos by mistake one would only need to
bring a sacrifice!


 


You are misunderstanding the metaphysics
of those who tell stories like this one. The sons dying wasn’t a punishment for
having pasul tefilin. It’s just that the way the world works is that what’s
written in your tefillin (or mezuzah) affects the world. So if the word “bni”
is missing from one’s tefillin, likewise his sons will be missing from his
life. It’s not a punishment, it’s a metzius.


 


&gt; Additionally, what kind
of God kills children because of scribal errors?


 


What kind of God kills
children because they drink bleach, with no idea of what it is? Again, it’s not
a punishment. It’s just how it works.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Granted, you will find many stories throughout Jewish lore about the protective powers of tzitzit.


I never implied that whoever disseminated that story was not motivated by profit, rather that the fact that such stories circulate does not mean &quot;charedim worship a sick and sadistic god&quot;.


In judiasm it is quite common to seek symbolism everywhere, as we find in much of the drash of the torah.


My point was not the removal of an evil decree rather the prevention of one.


Protection should definitely not be a motivator in mitzva observance even if the fact that it works would not be debatible]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Firstly, what a horrific way to explain away and minimize a family&#039;s tragedy. Your piece is very well stated.For clarification&#039;s sake, the word would be &#039;bonay&#039; not &#039;bni&#039;.I wanted to add that it is not unheard of for there to be mistakes even to this level of omission.I was working at a Shabbaton several years ago and during kriyas hatorah in the morning, the ba&#039;al koreh found a word to be missing halfway through the parasha. (I might add that the torah was less than a year old and I was present at a previous Shabbaton when it was completed and dedicated - just to point out that this was the first time the parasha a read from and not a situation where the error had gone unnoticed for years.)Much the same way we trust a shochet when he feels cow&#039;s lungs and tells us it&#039;s kosher, we&#039;re supposed to trust the sofer who closes our tefillin, that to his knowledge, everything was prepared properly. That is why we don&#039;t need to check our tefillin unless we have reason to believe they have been damaged (eg they were left out in the rain). I&#039;ve heard opinions that the same applies to mezuza. We&#039;re only required to regularly check those that are on the exterior of a home and thus more prone to damage due to exposure to the elements.
Sure, nowadays we have software that double checks for mistakes, but the tefillin under discussion were purchased nearly 20 years ago, when mistakes were still wholly chalked up to human error. Is the advent of new technology reason to start rushing to recheck everything? Presumably, these programs are capable of error themselves.
To offer a more extreme example, during the year when my friends and I were becoming bar mitzva, we were relayed a story by our Rebbe, I believe he told it as a message to how important it is to never miss a day of putting on tefillin. (I may not recall it perfectly, but this is how I remember it.) After a death in the family, he had come into possession of a pair of tefillin and had a desire to have them checked. Upon opening the batim, the sofer found that instead of the required parshiyos, they were stuffed with meaningless paper or comic strips. Now, the original owner had never missed a day of wearing this pair. Can we really say he was never yotze the mitzva of tefillin in his life because of a particular sofer&#039;s &#039;honest mistake&#039;? He never had any reason to think that his tefillin were anything less than perfect and as you mentioned he would still get all the s&#039;khar for his intent and in being meticulous about the mitzva.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Teffilin and Mezuzah hebejeebie, superstitious &quot;connection&quot; to reality is essential to core belief in a higher power in general and the jewish belief that we, as humans, have limited power and control. It is also directly related to other things such as the belief that a &quot;holy&quot; man with a long, white beard can say a few words out of his mouth and somehow those words will come to fruition because he muttered them (aka a brocha).

It is also directly related to other things such as the belief that a &#8220;holy&#8221; man with a long, white beard can say a few words out of his mouth and somehow those words will come to fruition because he muttered them (aka a brocha).<br />

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;but mezuzah, tefillin by virtue of their consistency should logically have more protective power&lt;/i&gt;

By your logic, I understand the mezuzah which is fixed 24/7, but tefillin?   What about tzitzit (especially talit katan), tefillah, daily learning, etc.?   Tefillin aren&#039;t worn on Shabbat and Yom Tov, and for the most people, only worn for a relatively short duration.  My examples certainly offer more consistency.   

Oh wait...  you wouldn&#039;t find an &quot;insightful&quot; scribal error in tzitzit so it&#039;s no fun.  Trying to darshen a message from incorrectly tied knots doesn&#039;t work so well. 

TESHUVA, TEFILLAH, TZEDAKAH - They are the three that we have a tradition can remove an evil decree.   Each require a person to make a commitment, to improve themselves, improve how they relate to G-d, and improve what they do to help their fellow man - and if all done right we hope will improve klal yisroel.    

Wearing computer checked Tefillin as protection?  That&#039;s people looking for an easy buck, and for their customers - an easy way out of actually doing something real to help themselves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The idea that mezuza has protective powers is found in Kabbalistic sources even if not found (according to Dr. Gordon, except for a minority opinion) in the Talmud and midrashic sources. Since it is found in the Zohar, those who believe in the Zohar&#039;s bar-Yochaic authorship and attribute to it as much weight (if not more so) than the Talmud, have reason to treat the mezuza as a &quot;magical&quot; device.

		<description><![CDATA[Even I concede the first half of your comment, the part where you said &quot;it&#039;s not big leap&quot; is a HUGE leap. You would need a very strong theological basis for it - which you don&#039;t. And then you make ANOTHER leap that assumes that God somehow communicates to Man via missing words in parchment that were written by humans! It was a human error that caused the missing word - not magic! How can that be a message?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for enlightening us as how current YU and Stern musmachim/ot arrive at a &#039;Halachic&#039; psak.
There should be no further questions regarding the rejectionism steming from the right. 

It is always morbidly fascinating to see ancient texts put through acrobatic twists to fit ones thinking.

		<description><![CDATA[Many people view the protective powers of Tefillin, Mezuzah, Succah etc. in a superstitious and simplistic way and I take it that is the point you are trying to convey in the article. Truthfully the argument can be made in quite a logical way- Mitzvos by definition protect the doer of the mitzvos as if one believes that one was put on the world to do g-ds will and g-ds will is for us to do mitzvos then the more one engages in mitzvos the more essential their role is here on earth. Thus it is not a big leap to say that if one is not engaging in mitzvos, regardless if it is intentional, they lose that protection. If you ask if that s the case then ALL mitzvos should have this power you are correct to a degree, but mezuzah, tefillin by virtue of their consistency should logically have more protective power as one is regularly engaged in them. The fact that the particular word bni is the one that is missing can just be a message that can help the person do whatever tshuva necessary to correct that deficiency or to help them realize the seriousness of the ramifications of ones actions.  ]]></description>
