		<description><![CDATA[They regularly report on events the entire world see as insignificant.  many non-orthodox Jews found the Siyum to be an incredible event. They missed the boat for one main reason, they are looking to promote sales. However you want to rationalize their misreporting it boils down to sales.  Taking a contrary view, and finding the controversy and inhumane point, however minuscule it may be, riles people up and sells papers.  It doesn&#039;t matter that of all the thousands of women who attended none of them had ill feelings about it.  They were certainly mistreated much the way Judaism always mistreats women.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The NYT is a newspaper devoted to New York, the US and the World, not to Jewish people. 100,00 Jews getting together is newsworthy even to non Jews, hence they report on it. But they do it through the lens of a secularist sensibility. The way Orthodox women are treated is clearly in conflict with modern, advanced, societies


It&#039;s not a misstep by The Times. It&#039;s appropriate reporting. That it offends Orthodox Jews points to the fact that this Orthodox practice has no place in an intellectual world.]]></description>

Maybe. Another thing is that they had to cater to everybody in order to make sure the stadium gets full.]]></description>

( Presumably they talked to them too. ) 

Oy vavoy... men intermingling with women... seeing them dance... it must have led to  who knows what... a shiduch?   what a klipah it must have been.  Rachmana Litzlan.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re missing the real story about the mechitza (just as they are). Seven and a half years ago there was a siyum in MSG and there were also women. There was also davening, and no mechitzah. I was there 15 years ago too, and I cannot remember if there were women (although there probably were) so I can&#039;t say anything about that.


So what changed in 8 years? Are we frummer, more scrupulous? No, we&#039;re crazier, more fundamentalist and going off the rails. Yes, I said and still say that the Siyum was wonderful and &quot;for one night all was well in Orthodoxy.&quot; But of course the mechitza was purchased with 250,000 wasted dollars many months ago, a planned further foray off the rails into nutiness. 


I had the same thought when I visited the Rambam&#039;s grave in 2004. I had previously been there in 1996. In 1996 there was no mechitza bissecting the grave, making it look ridiculous as it does now. And he lay there for 800 years before it, with no mechitza. What changed between 1996 and 2004? Did people start davening there? No, of course not.


So even though this was for 35 minutes, even though it was a very positive, pleasant event - the mechitza does signify something.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rav Moishe paskened that a mechitza is only required for davening WITHIN  a shul, and is NOT required for impromptu (and by that I mean outside of a bais keneses) minyanim, i.e. the minyanim that pop up in wedding halls (even within the heyligeh BP) etc.

		<description><![CDATA[My gut feeling is that they focused on the male-female separation and the mechitza for two primary reasons:
1. They were playing off the brouhaha a few months ago when we all (including the NY-area papers IIRC) discussed the high cost of the mechitza that would only be used for 6 hours (and really only got used for 35 minutes). So basically, they just took our lead and used that as the basis for their article.
2. The fact that it was &lt;b&gt;so&lt;/b&gt; obvious and noticeable. Tall and wide curtains, etc. A more demure mechitza, much shorter, and in colors that matched the seating area, would have been much less noticeable.


And, of course, the human interest &quot;hook&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clearly the siyum was an emotionally uplifting event for a huge number of Orthodox Jews.  I think that&#039;s awesome.  I think the behavior of participants as reported in the media and from participants was beyond reproach.  That makes frum Jews look good.  But I don&#039;t think you can translate the legitimate emotional high you and others got from the event to the outside world.  The Times likes to pick an angle that it thinks will pique the interest of its readers.  Rightly or wrongly, it felt that anecdotes about the rabbis from Israel and background about Talmud study were not as interesting as &quot;gender&quot; issues.

In an era when egalitarianism and social justice are taking center stage after centuries of women, people of color and homosexuals being marginalized, I don&#039;t find that surprising.  Whether or not you agree that Judaism marginalizes women, you can certainly see how the Times could make that assumption.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Until the last decade or two it was normal in Orthodox Judaism that when women are in a balcony, there is no additional mechitza.  What you say is &quot;normal&quot; for Orthodox Judaism is what has become &quot;normal&quot; in the last 20 years.  Fine and understandable for someone of your generation.  But people my age and older may have a different perception of what is &quot;normal&quot; and what isn&#039;t.  

We&#039;ve been fed a bunch of stories about the immutability and timelessness of Orthodox Jewish practices... yet I&#039;ve seen so much change in the short 30+ years that I&#039;ve been Orthodox that those stories are clearly bogus.]]></description>
