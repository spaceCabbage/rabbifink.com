Fairness perhaps, but so what? Life isn&#039;t always fair. When weighing values, perhaps, there is a greater value, in this instance, of preserving a place where men feel they can go just for men (same would go for women only places)]]></description>

But that&#039;s an imperfect metaphor, since the vast majority of the authorities in OJ want to perpetuate the marginalization of women.]]></description>
