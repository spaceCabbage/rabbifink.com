		<description><![CDATA[I agree that vaccinations isn&#039;t a terrific argument (hence the rest of my comment). But I still need to point out that vaccinations for diseases that have been eradicated have no immediate (or even long-term most likely) health benefit to the child. They only have an overall health benefit for the society at large (to ensure continued eradication if perhaps in another far corner of the world it hasn&#039;t been totally eradicated yet). The argument for giving these types of vaccines could be construed as similar to the argument for universal circumcision.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Although the NYT article that Rabbi Fink read may have focused on AIDS, other reports say that the American Academy of Pediatrics article (I don&#039;t have access to the article itself) says circumcision also reduces the incidence of urinary tract infections in infants (as well as HPV in both men and their female partners later on). 

In any case, Mark is absolutely right. The only way anyone could say parents have no right to make this decision for their child (as opposed to all the other life-changing decisions they make on their behalf) is if they&#039;re already convinced that circumcision is bad. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vaccinations are a poor argument.  Vaccinations have immediate health benefits to the child.  That&#039;s why they are given at such a young age, after all.  Circumcision&#039;s benefit comes later in life, if at all.  Also, vaccinations, assuming no adverse reactions, have no downsides.  Circumcision retards sexual satisfaction.  And despite what many Jews think, sexual satisfaction is important!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;When is this medical benefit realized? ... The medical benefit does not bolster the argument that we should circumcise at birth. Not at all.&lt;/i&gt;


The medical benefit is realized all the time. That&#039;s because it isn&#039;t as much an individual medical benefit as it is a societal medical benefit. The medical benefit can be described, for example, as such - &quot;A society whose males are predominantly circumcised will, on average, suffer fewer incidences of AIDS.&quot;


And the reasons why a society would opt to perform the circumcisions at birth is, one, because older males will rarely opt to have it done, two, it is less painful and easier to perform at that time, and three, the infant is already in the hospital, perhaps for the only time in his life before age 45, so it is an opportune time to perform the procedure in a [more] safe environment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;The reason they oppose circumcision is not because it is inherently harmful, rather it is because the choice is not being made by the person affected by the decision.&lt;/i&gt;


Perhaps. But if that is really the case, I would assume that they also oppose vaccinations - the vaccines that are injected INTO the baby&#039;s body also remain there for life, and they stimulate the body to create antibodies that otherwise wouldn&#039;t be there. And similarly the child has no choice in the matter.


And, frankly, the whole child&#039;s choice issue is somewhat ridiculous because the parents mold the child&#039;s psyche (with the child having no choice at all) in many more important and permanent ways that change the child, certainly &lt;b&gt;much&lt;/b&gt; more than the mere cutting off of a tiny foreskin might do.]]></description>
