		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve lived in USSR for 40 years, and I didn&#039;t believe in anything, except my uneducated, always poor, orphan, quiet, always tired from a hard work, often angry loving mother. She was a scared Jewish woman, who seemed had emptied heart for everything except me, her only son. I was listed as a Russian or Ukrainian - for we knew, that the doors to the universities and other high education schools were closed to most Jews, particularly poor. My passion was the theater, but I looked and talked like a Jew. After months of work on my accent and language at the age of 26 I finally was excepted to a college. I thought I would find a high purpose in Art, but the fricking communism penetrated and enslaved the Art as well. Without a purpose my life was bored by emptiness of my mind and my dormant soul. Only studying on my own I have found my real path. Russian culture absorbed as its own the works of many great Jewish masters in all fields of science, high art, music, literature and visual art. To name a few: 

Natural scientists  Alexei Alexeyevich Abrikosov, physicist, Nobel Prize (2003)  Ilya Frank, physicist, Nobel Prize (1958)
  Vitaly Ginzburg, physicist, Nobel Prize (2003)  Lev Landau, physicist, Nobel Prize (1962)  Selman Waksman, biochemist, Nobel Prize (1952)
MusiciansIrving Berlin composer and lyricist
Isaak Dunayevsky, composer
Vladimir Feltsman, pianist
Emil Gilels, pianist
Shlomo Mintz, violinist
David Oistrakh, violinist
Anton Rubinstein, pianist/composer
Isaac Stern, violinist
Yakov Skomarovsky, composer
Performing and fine artistsMarc Chagall, painter
Grigori Kozintsev, theater and film director
Isaac Levitan, painter
Solomon Mikhoels, actor &#038; director
Maya Plisetskaya, ballerina
Arkady Raikin, humorist
Lee Strasberg, acting teacher
Meyerhold, theater director
Writers and poetsSholom Aleichem, Yiddish-language writer
Isaac Babel, writer
Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, Hebrew-language writer
Joseph Brodsky, Russian-language poet, Nobel Prize (1987)
Ilya Ehrenburg, writer
Alexander Galich, playwright, poet
Ilya Ilf, writer
Osip Mandelstam, poet
Samuil Marshak, poet
Boris Pasternak, writer, Nobel Prize (1958)
Vladimir Vysotcky, poet, singer
The Moscow Helsinki Group Founders of the group included  Mikhail Bernshtam, Yelena Bonner, Alexander Ginzburg, Pyotr Grigorenko, Alexander Korchak, Malva Landa, Gregory Rosenstein, Vitaly Rubin, and ANATOLY SHCHARANSKY.Other people: Sofia Kalistratova, Naum Meiman, Yuri Mniukh, Victor Nekipelov, Tatiana Osipova, Felix Serebrov, Vladimir Slepak, Leonard Ternovsky.

Because I am old enough -  I had a chance not only to study most of them, but also an honor to meet some of them.As a result I&#039;ve become a follower of many great thinkers and masters, and as many of them I&#039;ve decided to brake with USSR and applied for a visa - it was denied. So, I am back to my smuggled books. Next time I was not only denied a visa, but had my  nose broken  by a KGB mutant in a dark alley. Luckily, later I&#039;ve met and married an American woman. And only on this land - mute and deaf linguistically - my dormant needs for a high spirituality had directed me to what my mother was - a quietly and silently living Jew. Only difference with me that time is that I am not afraid to feel, behave and openly enjoy the challenge to learn, to understand and to be in the mix with people that my mother was separated with. Thank God - he arranged the Shul on the Beach - at the beginning of Paloma - the avenue where I&#039;ve rented a room upon arriving here. It&#039;s hard to learn Torah, but it is challenge I&#039;ve embraced with a devotion. I think, BELIEF is a magnet, that with the help of the stubborn desire creates and than - attracts and absorbs purposely materialized dream.

		<description><![CDATA[I spent years trying to figure out my relationship to orthodoxy.  The split personality required is incredible, and even quite painful at times.

I think that spending time around believers is absolutely the way that people get sucked into the orthodox lifestyle.

Three people in my life, all men, left orthodoxy and went on to quite accomplished lives.  They have no anger about their orthodox upbringing.  They are like the most accomplished guys you could find.  And totally secular and psychologically healthy (no easy feat for anyone in this world.)

They all just walked away, and it never concerned them again.

As someone who struggles with it – I ask – how did they do it??  I turn myself inside out with this stuff!

		<description><![CDATA[The comparison between Nessie and religion is apt, (though
as you say, there is far more value to belief in religion than in mythical
sea-monsters). I’m uncomfortable, though, with the conclusion that you draw.
You seem to be assuming that one SHOULD believe, and if they find it difficult,
here’s an eitza. 


 


I would draw the exact opposite conclusion. Look how someone
who started out skeptical came to believe in something as silly as the Loch
Ness Monster simply by spending time with others who believed it. Therefore we
should be very cautious about our beliefs, especially if they are
wholeheartedly endorsed by everyone around us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe you can write a post to describe why there is no comparison. After all, in different periods of history, mythical monsters were taught to be real. Now, we say they are imaginary. Are we living in an era where slowly this invisible Creator is joining the ranks of the imaginary...........if the evidence for both is the same?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;I&#039;d counter that there is at least as much evidence of a Creator than there is of a sea monster.


That....doesn&#039;t sound too good. I mean, why believe then? After all, we pretty much mock people that believe in such mythic monsters. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your comments, Menachem and Jacob.  From my anecdotal evidence (but correct me if I&#039;m wrong), It would seem that people who are FFB, but not longer believe, may remain Orthodox because that&#039;s how they grew up, they want to keep their family and friends, don&#039;t want to rock the boat etc., but I don&#039;t know too many BT&#039;s who (at least openly) would tell me that they love Torah, but have serious doubts about it&#039;s origin/belief in G-d/Torah&#039;s historical accuracy, but chose to become frum anyway.  Most of them tell me they believe it is the &quot;correct&quot; way and then try to &quot;prove&quot; G-ds existence to me with the Kuzari argument or a range of other Kiruv tactics.

I think my concern about fully committing to Orthodoxy, while still having these doubts, is that I feel like I would be living a lie.  I don&#039;t believe I could openly express my doubt in the community and it is difficult for me to imagine an Orthodox man willingly wanting to marry me if I were to express these doubts openly. 

This struggle has been ongoing for so many years (about 5), that I finally decided I just need to go to Seminary and make a decision (something I should&#039;ve done long ago).  So, I&#039;m in the process of setting that up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, I agree with both of you. In response to your last point- what happens when living a questionable, orthodox lifestyle ISN&#039;T worth it? When living an orthodox lifestyle precludes living a happy life? (I&#039;ll leave examples to your imaginations)
I once heard that its hard to convince a non-religious guy to join orthodoxy. But bring him to a shabbos seuda and let him experience a chulent...ah geshmak!&quot; 
After hearing that i thought- how many of us are just here for the chulent too?]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, I agree with both of you. In response to your last point- what happens when living a questionable, orthodox lifestyle ISN&#8217;T worth it? When living an orthodox lifestyle precludes living a happy life? (I&#8217;ll leave examples to your imaginations)<br />

		<description><![CDATA[You write that &quot;many people want to believe. It is just hard to believe. If one wants to believe and they are conflicted about their beliefs, it is wise to do whatever one can do to reinforce those beliefs.&quot; 
Why is that wise? Just like the loch ness monster, belief that is caused (or reinforced) by surrounding one&#039;s self with a community, should be questioned - because it may very well be wrong. (Granted, it may help the person satisfy their WANT to believe - but wise? )


Also, I think that this person who WANTS to believe, only wants this BECAUSE he/she is surrounded by a community that does. If he lived/identified elsewhere, he&#039;d likely have little desire. Therefore, your last advice of immersing in the community has already happened and yet the person is still WANTING to believe.

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Doesn&#039;t successful kiruv of atheists kind of prove my point?


I was actually thinking about this question last night. Just how successful IS kiruv to atheists? I mean, take a well educated atheists in the sciences and moral psychology. Then, take a well educated Jew in gemara. How many of these types of atheists are becoming believers vs. these types of Jews becoming atheists?]]></description>

I grew up in a non-observant household and have been trying to strattle the &quot;scientific/rational/logical&quot; side of me and the side of me that loves Torah, and as you can imagine it isn&#039;t working out so well.  As much as I&#039;ve studied and love Orthodox Judaism and see so many perks to joining the community, I honestly believe I would have to become intelectually dishonest with myself to do so, which is not something I&#039;m willing to do. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is the &quot;value&quot; in believing or in being a believer?  Not sure there is much intrinsic value to believing, but there is enormous reinforcement in being part of a believer community.  As part of &quot;our&quot; community you:


- are told that, as a Jew, you&#039;re pretty much the center of the universe, the reason for creation.
- are given the security of &quot;knowing&quot; that after you die you&#039;ll go to a better place. (You just have to follow the rules.)
- have the comfort of knowing that you&#039;ll see all of your dead loved ones again someday.
- are strongly reinforced for all of your religious actions; praying, learning, keeping Kosher and Shabbat etc.
- have a strong support system of hundreds, if not thousands, for employment, care when you&#039;re ill, finding housing, etc.
- And much more...

With all of these psychological and physical benefits it is easy to see how people can suspend critical thinking in order to belong and how they&#039;ll let their minds be &quot;convinced&quot; by weak &quot;evidence&quot; like blurry pictures, hashgacha pratit stories, or shoddy &quot;God of the gaps&quot; logic.


The challenge is to be able synthesize rational thought with belief.  And as your previous post pointed out, that is becoming increasingly difficult in our day and age.  Mr. Edwards and your Chabbad lady may actually explain why so many believers choose not to engage in critical thinking - the benefits of being a believer may actually outweigh rational thinking for some.]]></description>

Perhaps the fact that she made that call, something that was contrary to everything she believed, something that was completely unexpected of her, indicates that she is the kind of person that is susceptible to this kind of thing (kiruv or immersion).


The same question can be asked regarding joining cults - why are some people susceptible and others not?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mrs. Edwards was not surrounded by a community of believers, just one person who believed very strongly. This has little to do with immersing oneself in a society of like minded believers.


I do not believe immersing yourself in a community of believers is a solution to the struggle of belief. The curious-minded soul will always be searching for answers, and if answers cannot be found in the community, he will search outside. 


Someone for whom the sense of belonging derived from being part of a community is enough to overcome their need for rationalism, logic and reason, then religion is perfect for them.]]></description>
