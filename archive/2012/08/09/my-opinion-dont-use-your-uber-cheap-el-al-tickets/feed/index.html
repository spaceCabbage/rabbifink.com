		<description><![CDATA[&quot;If my brother accidentally advertised a product worth $1000 for $400 I would alert him to his error. I wouldn’t exploit his error.&quot;


How about if your brother intentionally charges  $1600-$2000 over and over for that product worth $1000?


P.S. Let&#039;s be real, El Al is only being so gracious because the know they will get the money back from the third party.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For what it&#039;s worth (and for those feeling guilty), after sending an email asking whether ELAL would prefer we just cancel the tix, or if it is ok to keep them and upgrade to nonstop (and pay the extra $600 for 4 tix), Swarti at ELAL (who was probably the nicest customer rep i remember dealing with), just called me in reply to my email and she said that she had confirmed with her supervisors that they want us to come to Israel, preferably nonstop but only to improve our experience (her words, though i&#039;m sure the money is also involved) rather than canceling the tickets. i&#039;m still not fully convinced, but my conscience has been adequately soothed to take advantage!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@twitter-93429472:disqus R Gil Student suggested your suggestion to just ask ELAL on Hirhurim, and i had also tried that out, but to be honest, it is impractical as you can&#039;t really get a straight answer. 

I sent an email last friday and another one on Tuesday and still have not gotten a response from ELAL. Today I spoke to a customer service rep and he said (in a little broken hebrew) the directive from above was to do their best to help those who want to turn their tix into non-stop tix, and they are happy for everyone and there was no hint that they should encourage people to cancel, just that they can until Aug 31 and then they will not be able to cancel no matter what.The problem with Rasking if ELAL is ok with the deal is it really puts people on the spot, and they don’t want to lose the good press by encouraging (or in any way admitting that they want) cancellations, so i don’t know if one can get a straight answer. ELAL is not a singular being with an opinion, but lots of people taking all sorts of non-essential factors into consideration as to whether “ELAL” is ok with going through with this, and they refuse to officially say that the nonstop change will help them at all (the rep said this is just for the convenience of the tourists). 

So i&#039;m still stuck debating what to do. considering keeping the tix until after Aug 31 to see what they say if i ask to cancel the tix at that point, but since i&#039;d be dealing with a know-nothing customer rep, they probably wouldn&#039;t even get it and refuse cancellation based on the basic rules.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@a37e94f833d3f16fb10ab884cb77fe89:disqus: I understand your statement much better now. It seems like I misunderstood it completely, I agree that when it is going &#039;above the letter of the law&#039; then each person may and should have their discretion as to when to apply that. However, for myself, I believe that if I am going to go above the letter of the law for one person/company I should apply that decision unilaterally unless it is impossible for me to do. (ie: it would cause me harm) Thank you for clarifying your position.

		<description><![CDATA[Shuky, Thank you for your response. Below I try to better illustrate my argument. 


Let me give you a concrete example. Some years ago I found a fairly good price on a ticket. Lets say for about $100. I click through all the screens and the number says $100 dollars every time. I get to the final screen and enter credit card info and make the transaction. I did not notice on the final screen that they also had a check mark to buy insurance on the flight for $15. The check mark is auto filled in. I did not check it. But once I hit the pay button I notice that I now have a charge for $115. Now I look up the insurance. It has a $75 deductible. I contact the company which tells me, yes I can cancel but contact the insurance company. The insurance company tells me to contact the airline. I even do all the paperwork on both ends. End story I get nowhere and give up. I think I can fairly say in this case that deceptive unethical practices cost me $15 (and a lot of wasted time). Perhaps they were legally within their rights. But I would be ashamed to make money that way. So now, for argument&#039;s sake imagine they make a $15 mistake. By law I am within my rights to keep the $15 from their mistake. If I had no previous history with them I might go lifnei mishuros hadin (above and beyond the requirements of the law) and give them back their $15. But I would say it would be completely ethical for me not to bother with doing that. I hope this clarifies what I am saying. In dealing with a specific entity that ripped me off (albeit legally) I will not steal from them but I will not do them the favor of going above and beyond the law to help them. 
(NOTE- yes, technically the insurance company was a seperate entity from the airline but the airline probably got a hefty fee for not only offering the policy but sneaking it in as a default option in a deceptive way. furthermore, the airline took no responsiblity for the practice or helping me negotiate with its affiliate. Moreover, the offering was a decidedly shabby offering (flight insurance to cover my not being able to take flight on a 100 ticket with a deductible of $75 which costs $15.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A good chunk of those who bought $400 tickets would have bought $1000 tickets, so its not parallel.

While there&#039;s no way of knowing a hypothetical, I bet El-Al is happier selling a ticket for $400 than not selling one at all, certainly in the winter, non-holiday months.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My thoughts, for what they&#039;re worth:

Rabbi Tendler&#039;s litmus test is typical of his style (I went to the Mechina myself). I think it is a nice sentiment, but not one that I necessarily agree with. I treat strangers differently than I treat my brother. Is that rational? Should it be that way? I don&#039;t know, but I think that it is the way the world works and as such is the way I live.


I was never much of a Tendler guy, anyway. If I had to choose a rebbe muvhak from Mechina, I would name someone else (and I won&#039;t name him here, because he wouldn&#039;t appreciate that I&#039;m typing this on Shabbos...). And I suspect his answer to this would be, &quot;Al pi din you are entitled to the ticket, and you do not have to treat them any differently than the way they would treat you. If they made a mistake in their favor, they&#039;d keep the money. So you can keep the money, too.&quot;


Yes, I know. &quot;Two wrongs don&#039;t make a right.&quot; I think that&#039;s an empty platitude. We&#039;re not trying to take two wrongs and turn them into a right, we&#039;re trying to do business on an even playing field. If this was true theft, then I would agree. But because we&#039;re only discussing going lifnim m&#039;shuras hadin, I don&#039;t think there&#039;s an issue.


Kiddush Hashem? Okay, I&#039;ll give you this one. If you care about that, then return the tickets. I personally don&#039;t care about kiddush hashem, so I&#039;d keep the tickets.


While I&#039;m on my soapbox, a few words about some other things that people brought up in the comments:


Any discussion of whether this is good for El Al or not is irrelevant. There is no way this is as good as selling tickets at a higher price, or they&#039;d do this more often. If they managed to put a marketing spin on this, all the power to them. They&#039;re still losing money.


Any discussion of how much they mark tickets up, or how much they&#039;re earning, or price gouging, etc. is also irrelevant. They&#039;re in the business of making money. They are allowed to do that stuff, and there is no such thing as having &quot;extra&quot; or &quot;too much&quot; money. Their money goes to pay the salaries of individuals just like you and I - all types of people. Sure, there are some really rich people making a gazillion dollars. But if the corporation loses money, who do you think loses first? It&#039;s the guy throwing suitcases onto airplanes, not the CEO.


About the corporation vs. individual thing: corporations are collections of people (shareholders), so when you hurt a corporation you are hurting those people. Is it worse to hurt one person a lot (take $600 from your brother) than a lot of people just a little (take $0.01 from 60,000 people)? I think it is. That&#039;s why I believe that stealing from your next-door neighbor is worse than stealing from Wal-mart. (They&#039;re both wrong, but there are degrees and lots of shades of wrong. And when it&#039;s not stealing, but just not going beyond the letter of the law, these distinctions make all the difference.)

		<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t get what all the discussion is about.  

1) The pricing was clearly a mistake.  
2) There was no intent to deceive through marketing
3) Action was swiftly taken to remove such online prices
4) Their perceived usual high pricing is not justification for taking advantage
5) Taking the ticket at their loss is most definitely stealing. I&#039;m not even sure halachically they were really &#039;mochel.&#039; They did what they had to as a business to prevent further damage. Unless they could state clearly that they will assuredly not lose money on this, I&#039;d consider it stealing. The huge loss is already realized. Any positive due to PR/legal is purely hypothetical.
6) Even if you want to nitpick and say &#039;halachically&#039; you have no obligation to cancel, I think this is an easy case where a Jew should take the high road and go beyond the letter of the law. You&#039;re probably not correct on the halacha either.
7) Suppose Bill Gates dropped his wallet and you found it. Who knows, he might be a nice guy and offer you its contents as a thank you. And that is his right. Now, if he lost five thousand wallets, do you think he&#039;d give it all to you? Further, in this case what are you returning? All you are doing is taking! You&#039;re returning your loyalty to them? Why should they have lost your loyalty. They made a mistake! NO, a third-party made a mistake! 

If you honestly still think keeping the ticket is &#039;kosher,&#039; you really need to do some soul searching.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree completely. This is a large corporation, harmed by negligence and incompetence of people who are paid to prevent this from occuring, using practices which hinge on the deception of hidden costs and snap decisions. It is further bound by the contractual element mentioned. I disagree with Rabbi Tendler&#039;s test quoted above. To me the test should be what would the other party expect if the roles were reversed. Large corporations are held to a higher standard than private consumers in law, as they should be. Going beyond the letter of the law may be commendable, but I would not treat a corporation as I would an individual. That goes against basic capitalism and arguably would harm the individual shareholders in the long run. Too many reasons for me to buy the argument that there is a compelling ethical interest in declining a deal offered by the company. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Its not about the chill pill. its about how stupid people can get. A good deal is a good deal regardless of a glitch. All this &quot; chillel hashem garbage&quot; is not bec you believe it At all its bec you didn&#039;t get a ticket! Had the person who wrote this letter gotten a ticket he would have packed his bags and bounced! Its pathetic how ppl write such dumb things that they know nothing about!
And just to ad on- i was debating weather to write anything as this is the fist time ive ever written a comment on a blog or website. It just pisses me off when people ruin a good thing instead of appreciating it. This stuff is backed by insurence and who cares About  glitches? there  are tons of them everywhere on the web every month. A deal is a Deal Go party hardy and enjoy urself.

		<description><![CDATA[Me too. Minutes after seeing the dansdeals link on twitter, I had expedia up with 7 tickets booked and ready to be paid for. In the end, I didn&#039;t do it. There was no way a $356 fare was real and valid, just no way.


As an aside, expedia is a pain when booking for a family of 7 because they only allow 2 adults and up to 4 kids on a single booking, so I had to divide it in two.

		<description><![CDATA[It probably would not have happened. No other airline flies to Israel as often as El Al. If there was a massive sale to Saudi Arabia, I doubt a run on the tickets would have taken place. The specific circumstances of this sale are unique. Most of the ticket purchasers are orthodox Jews and they are traveling to Israel. That does change things a bit.

		<description><![CDATA[People bought the tickets who otherwise wouldn&#039;t have been able to afford them.  They seized an opportunity.  Now how much money did El Al actually lose?  Are airline tickets at over $1,000 actually priced correctly?  These are unrelated questions, but ultimately the right thing to do is let people be people on this.  They bought the tickets.  They didn&#039;t steal them.  An opportunity came for them to buy something - which they still spent hundreds of dollars to purchase.  I can&#039;t agree with the opinion here.  It&#039;s unfair to ask so much from people that don&#039;t have many other opportunities to travel.  It&#039;s an uncomfortable reality, but by asking them to do the &quot;right&quot; thing we&#039;re just saying they&#039;ve done the &quot;wrong&quot; thing, which is a tall accusation.]]></description>

It&#8217;s an uncomfortable reality, but by asking them to do the &#8220;right&#8221; thing we&#8217;re just saying they&#8217;ve done the &#8220;wrong&#8221; thing, which is a tall accusation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with your conclusion but understand that it&#039;s much easier to say this is the right thing to do than to do it... I don&#039;t judge anyone who chooses not to do what should be done here, but come on, at least people can admit this was not an advertised sale, everyone knew there was something fishy and yet everyone jumped on board to get a piece... no one could believe this was not due to some sort of error or glitch.  So, right or wrong, people took advantage of El Al- but only god judges and what goes around comes around and so, each person must decide how they will handle this... I&#039;m actually glad it&#039;s not my demon to fight in all honesty!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[O&#039; please. There is no crime. It&#039;s a &#039;deal.&#039; 


Treat your brother the way you would treat an inanimate company? Businesses make mistakes.  &#039;Business&#039; is not family.  


What would happen if it went the other way, priced too high by 
accident and people paid too much? Would El Al vocalize the overage and 
return the 
money?  Show me the money ! 




Where&#039;s Steven Colbert??? Are corporations people?  Does a company have feelings?  



Keep the ticket.  Be thankful to El Al for being professional and 
recognizing error.  Every business has damage control days.  Hope no one was fired as a result.  Enjoy the 
time at the King David.  ]]></description>

&quot;&quot;But why shouldn&#039;t companies who exploit by legal loopholes be given some of their own medicine? They have left ethics in the dust. What is the point of showering them with ethics&quot;&quot;

 The way that I understood that, was that you mean that one should not tap into their personal [normal] ethical practices towards a company that &quot;left ethics in the dust.&quot; I was trying to impress with my comment that one person/company&#039;s ethics should not hold a place in someone&#039;s response with their ethical practices. 


I was not trying to attack you on a personal level, I was responding to your comment, which I now realize I may have misunderstood. Thank you in advance for explaining this to me. It is annoying with text and the internet we often cannot convey more to our words. I hope my words have not been taken by you in the wrong way.
