		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s pretty mixed (that is, a mixture of all kinds of datiim with no secular people at all). The thing that I am not getting is, if Ramat Bet Shemesh is generally mixed like you and @c057154fd302f905d4249b838f2495f5:disqus describe here, where are all the bitter complaints coming from? I mean the complaints like these:
* Future RBS neighborhoods are being designed only for Charedim.
* City funds are almost only directed toward Charedi institutions rather than to parks, neighborhood improvement.
* General indifference toward violent or anti-social acts in the name of religion.
* Tznius signs.
* Very low representation in the IDF.
* Claims that a large percentage of people don&#039;t pay full arnona (if the buildings are generally composed of the people you describe, this claim is almost definitely untrue because normal working people of all types don&#039;t get arnona reductions).
* Claims of a high percentage of unemployment by choice among men.
* And all the other complaints that &quot;everyone&quot; seems to know are true.


I&#039;m beginning to suspect that the truth probably lies somewhere in between the claims of each side of the issue. As usual.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One more data point for RBS-A:
Our building is 8 apartments. The families are:
1 Breslov Chassid
1 Anglo (MO, as near as I can tell, but he keeps to himself)
1 French DL
1 Israeli DL
1 Anglo DL
1 Israeli Chareidi (Litvishe)
1 Anglo Chareidi (went to Shaalvim, but decided Chareidi offered a better chance of religious success)
Us.


For our neighborhood, this is more or less representative of most of the buildings. It may be less typical of buildings in the so-called Mishkenos Yaakov neighboorhood, but it does reflect the Dolev side of town much better than any newspaper report, or even that of many Bet Shemesh residents who, by their own admission, never come to RBS anymore (just to be clear, I&#039;m not referring to anyone in this thread)).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, you said, &quot;I bet everyone there is Charedi or nearly Charedi.&quot; I was asking about your definition of a &quot;nearly charedi&quot; person, not a building. Second, if you tossed a coin ten times, you would be very unlikely to get 5 heads and 5 tails. Similarly, just by chance you would have different percentages of charedim in different buildings, unless you have a quota system. Third, men over a certain age aren&#039;t called up for miluim. Fourth, the army doesn&#039;t want olim who come after a certain age.

But in answer to your question, out of 10 apartments, probably 5 of them have men who currently serve in miluim, another one definitely used to, one made aliya around age 40, and I don&#039;t know about the others. 

Kippot and schools vary.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know what you mean by &quot;nearly Charedi.&quot; As far as I&#039;m concerned, &quot;charedi&quot; is more of a political and social concept than a religious one. No, there are no signs on my building about how women should dress or where they may walk. I&#039;ve only seen signs about modest dress on stores (and I find them objectionable there, too), not residential buildings. And I don&#039;t know of any signs in this neighborhood telling women where not to walk. ]]></description>

Really? Not at all?


Maybe your building is mixed (and when you say mixed, I bet everyone there is Charedi or nearly Charedi), but what about the street to your building? Does it have signs about how women must dress and where they may walk? Here is a link to a video from Bet Shemesh that was published today - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhnV8DoB3-k ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the problem with the term &quot;Chareidi&quot;. It is used to label a ridiculously broad array of ideologies; all the way from &quot;modern&quot; yeshiva guys who work and went to college to Satmar, Neturei Karta and other Chassidic sects.

It&#039;s a real shame that the US Yeshiva folks (recently) adopted this term from their Israeli counterparts.  It&#039;s a tad ironic that you refer to yourself as &quot;real Chareidi&quot; as the other &quot;real Chareidim&quot; in Israel look at their modern US brethren as barely frum. 

Your swipe at MO is wrongheaded and illustrates a huge problem that some in the Chareidi world have.  We hear this endless drone, here in Israel, of how people &quot;hate&quot; Chareidim. Of course, in general, that&#039;s nonsense. Criticizing someone&#039;s ideology, practice, and/or philosophy does not mean you &quot;hate&quot; them.  But rather than deal with the issues substantively, the Chareidi leadership and media &quot;circle the wagons&quot; and lash out, turning anyone who disagrees with them and their version of &quot;truth&quot; into an enemy. This is a large part of way some Chareidim find it so difficult to live among those not like them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I live in Ramat Beit Shemesh Aleph and it&#039;s not like that at all. My building is a mix of haredi and non-haredi, all deeply committed, fully observant Jews but with different modes of dress and different religious views. Everyone gets along wonderfully and I&#039;ve never heard anyone criticize anyone else&#039;s observance. I don&#039;t doubt that your friends had this experience, but it&#039;s not the norm. I see people dressed immodestly and I don&#039;t see anyone disturbing them. (I can&#039;t say no one does because obviously I don&#039;t follow them around everywhere they go.)

Incidentally, the school that was in the news last year isn&#039;t in Ramat Beit Shemesh. It&#039;s just outside Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet, but also just outside several non-haredi neighborhoods. 

Also, having a mix of secular and religious residents in a neighborhood would not encourage thugs to be more tolerant. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a real shame you (as well as many many others in the modern ortho world) have not learned to differentiate between yerushalmi chareidim and other chareidim.

		<description><![CDATA[As an aside, one sentence in the article that I found to be hilarious is this one -


&quot;On the other hand, Dagan says one community is thinking of moving together to Bet Shemesh because its members can&#039;t find affordable shelter in the capital.&quot;


The fact that the author included this sentence with a straight face is indicative that he didn&#039;t research the situation very well. This is because Dagan and his friends moving from Yerushalaim to Bet Shemesh is proverbially jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire. Yerushalaim is ~30% Charedi and they are &lt;i&gt;slowly&lt;/i&gt; taking over, Bet Shemesh is more like 40+% Charedi and they are &lt;i&gt;quickly&lt;/i&gt; taking over. There is already a Charedi mayor in Bet Shemesh and Charedim will gain more power in the next municipal elections sometime next year. Furthermore, based on building plans and population growth of Bet Shemesh, it is likely that Charedim may attain a majority in the municipal elections after that. And Charedim generally concentrate their vote and almost always vote for the person backed by their Rabbis (unlike other populations that individuals vote their conscience and may split their vote among various parties/people).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@1a71b534c43c54971ea99de1160111c1:disqus &lt;i&gt;So far, we&#039;ve had a modicum of success by standing up to them and having essentially zero-tolerance for anti-social and illegal behavior.&lt;/i&gt;



From my vantage point, the only bit of success so far in Bet Shemesh (really primarily Ramat Bet Shemesh) is the limiting of personal attacks over the last 6 months or so. But the &quot;big picture&quot; anti-social behavior continues almost unabated. I mean behavior such as :
* Charedim paying less arnona (roughly equivalent to municipal property tax) than everyone else.
* Signs directing where women are permitted to walk.
* Signs directing how women must dress in certain neighborhoods.
* Almost all Charedim not contributing to the defense of the country.
* A very large percentage of Charedi men being unemployed or underemployed.
* Influencing building projects to be built and marketed in such a way as to only attract a single segment of population (rather than a healthy mix that encourages tolerance).
* Stealing signs/banners/etc that you disagree with (for example Israeli flags on Yom ha&#039;Azmaut).
* Preventing the opening of community centers and even some shopping centers.
* Efforts to control all religious facilities (shuls, mikvaot, schools, etc) to the detriment of others.
* And there are &lt;b&gt;plenty&lt;/b&gt; of other examples as we all know.


Now I&#039;ll tell you a story. In 1997, before my wife and I married, we looked around Israel for a place to purchase an apartment or house. We looked in many places and one of the places that made it to the top-3 list was Bet Shemesh, specifically Ramat Bet Shemesh that was just in the process of being developed at the time. It was almost ideal, we had friends in the area, it was centrally located more or less between Yerushalaim and Tel Aviv, and the plans we were shown for the apartments and homes were quite good when compared to many other places. Most of all, the prices were reasonable (for example, we also seriously looked in Givat Shmuel and the prices there were substantially higher for smaller sized apartments). We visited probably 5 or 6 developers and almost all of them told us that Ramat Bet Shemesh was being developed &quot;1/3 Chiloni (secular), 1/3 Dati Leumi (orthodox), and 1/3 Charedi (ultra-orthodox)&quot;. And if you looked at the layout of the streets (mostly still gravel at the time), you could see that it was so. A ring of private (or semi-attached) houses, rings of duplexes here and there, and larger apartments with many small rooms in various places. And we almost purchased a place there, I mean we had sample contracts in hand and we approached our bank to figure out the (complex) mortgage process, and even asked a relative who is an attorney to help us understand the contracts and the process. In the end, life intervened and many things changed which negated our plans to purchase an apartment/house.


Fast forward a few years and one of the aforementioned friends (a Dati Leumi family) who lived in Ramat Bet Shemesh mentioned that he was having &quot;problems&quot; with the neighbors. Turns out that in that part of Ramat Bet Shemesh, the Charedim were waging a battle to clear their neighborhood of anyone who wasn&#039;t Charedi. And furthermore, to clear it of anyone who wasn&#039;t their type of Charedi. There were incidents of vandalism that became worse and worse - throwing things, paint, breaking windows, damaging their car, etc. And nothing could be done. Nothing at all. The neighbors were hell-bent on getting rid of this family and nothing could stop them. Most &quot;amusing&quot; is the fact that this guy worked for the Israeli Police in Yerushalaim and still couldn&#039;t prevent it! After over a year and a half of harassment and vandalism, my friends sold their apartment and moved. They couldn&#039;t take it anymore. When my wife and I heard their stories all that time, the main thing we were thinking was &quot;Phew, I&#039;m so glad we didn&#039;t buy there.&quot;


Lest anyone think that the extremism among Charedim is a new thing, please realize that it is not new. The above took place about 10 years ago. The holy purpose of Charedism requires insularity (because there is no easy way to raise new Charedim unless they are insulated from the world-at-large, especially from others who live a non-Charedi orthodox lifestyle), and &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; action taken to ensure that insularity is considered a holy action directed by God and is therefore considered to be commanded and above any human law that may prevent such actions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I live in Bet Shemesh where we&#039;re experiencing a microcosm of this issue, as I&#039;m sure you&#039;re aware. I didn&#039;t read the Time article, but I doubt I have to, as I&#039;ve been living it for the past 5-6 years.  

While I&#039;m sure there is some tit for tat going on in Jerusalem, there&#039;s no question that, in general, a subset Chareidim are not capable of living in a &quot;live and let live&quot; situation. We&#039;ve experienced this first-hand, as some of the more extreme &quot;Yerushalmi&quot; Chareidim began moving into our city and immediately began to &quot;pee&quot; on their turf, so to speak. 

So far, we&#039;ve had a modicum of success by standing up to them and having essentially zero-tolerance for anti-social and illegal behavior.  

There is no question that there is a clear goal, which has been publicly stated, that the intent of some is for Bet Shemesh to become a Chareidi city.  Even some &quot;moderate&quot; Chareidim would prefer not to be exposed to &quot;outside&quot; influences which, btw, also includes non-Chareidi orthodox Jews, and all the more so secular Jews.  It to this, I believe, that normal open-minded more liberal people are reacting to when they don&#039;t want their neighborhoods &quot;taken over&quot;. 

That&#039;s a start...]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I live in Bet Shemesh where we&#8217;re experiencing a microcosm of this issue, as I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re aware. I didn&#8217;t read the Time article, but I doubt I have to, as I&#8217;ve been living it for the past 5-6 years.  </p>
<p>While I&#8217;m sure there is some tit for tat going on in Jerusalem, there&#8217;s no question that, in general, a subset Chareidim are not capable of living in a &#8220;live and let live&#8221; situation. We&#8217;ve experienced this first-hand, as some of the more extreme &#8220;Yerushalmi&#8221; Chareidim began moving into our city and immediately began to &#8220;pee&#8221; on their turf, so to speak. </p>
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve had a modicum of success by standing up to them and having essentially zero-tolerance for anti-social and illegal behavior.  </p>
<p>There is no question that there is a clear goal, which has been publicly stated, that the intent of some is for Bet Shemesh to become a Chareidi city.  Even some &#8220;moderate&#8221; Chareidim would prefer not to be exposed to &#8220;outside&#8221; influences which, btw, also includes non-Chareidi orthodox Jews, and all the more so secular Jews.  It to this, I believe, that normal open-minded more liberal people are reacting to when they don&#8217;t want their neighborhoods &#8220;taken over&#8221;. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s a start&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[ &lt;i&gt;Is the goal to have a city like Jerusalem completely charedi?&lt;/i&gt;

Can you substitute &quot;halacha observant&quot; for &quot;chareidi&quot; in that sentence and answer it?

Most Orthodox Jews believe that all Jews should observe halacha; therefore they would say that the goal or ideal should indeed be that Jewish Israeli cities should be completely halacha observant.

 think your original question is basically the same question, with the line of &quot;observance&quot; drawn differently by different people.]]></description>
