		<description><![CDATA[The lack of archaeological evidence for a nation of 600,000 wandering the desert, given the effort that&#039;s gone into looking for it, is troubling.  Granted &quot;Counter-evidence is not proof,&quot; but it&#039;s staggeringly unlikely. More troubling is the evidence that israelite culture was not a sudden shock or transformation to life in Canaan, but an evolving continuum.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;That doesn’t mean that I think archeology is a waste of time. I think we
 should accept it for what it is – a peek into a world we are shown 
through the the lens of Bible.&lt;/i&gt;

Archeology as a discipline is not looking through the lens of the Bible.  It seems you are suggesting that the faithful should strive to see their findings through the lens of the Bible. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed. There doesn&#039;t have to be much of a coincidence for there to be a seal with a man and a large animal. I&#039;m sure that could have been from thousands of oral narratives in the ancient world. A man and an animal is very vague.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this is an important view religionists have to hold since it will protect them from archeological discoveries that counter biblical stories are seem to imply that they never happened (ie no records of dwellers in the desert.)
Not sure whether a non-religionists or rationalist have to hold this view, although they should anyway, maybe. ]]></description>
