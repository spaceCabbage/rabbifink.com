		<description><![CDATA[&quot;So creating LEGO that appeals to girls we are helping them play in a way that boys normally play. But by making it appealing for girls, girls are discouraged from playing with boys and they are discouraged from playing other boyish games. By playing into the stereotype we might actually be preventing girls from reaching their potential.&quot;

I strongly suspect this isn&#039;t what you meant, but what you wrote sort of implies that it&#039;s okay to have legos (and by extension video games and other toys) all tailored toward boys, thus forcing the girls to play with toys they aren&#039;t as attracted to as the boys are.

I would suggest that a possible solution (and I suspect you would agree) would be to have more gender neutral legos and other toys and games, which would be attractive to both boys and girls, and which they would enjoy playing together.

For example, when I was a girl, I greatly enjoyed playing with gender-neutral lego sets that could be made into things like houses and other buildings. Of course, I was a tomboy, so maybe buildings are boyish?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed.

Though, your articles don&#039;t really help that much. Peggy Orenstein&#039;s larger audience is not discouraging ALL Interaction. In fact, they are probably mostly secular people that their kids do play with the opposite gender. But for her, that is not enough.]]></description>

It&#039;s not about boys playing with girl toys and girls playing with boy toys. It&#039;s about PLAYING TOGETHER!

The current version of orthodox Judaism discourages ALL INTERACTION between young boys and girls. I&#039;m not suggesting giving boys American Girl Dolls. I am suggesting that boys and girls PLAY TOGETHER.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;This is the relevant part from the article:

Therefore what? Than where are all the monsters in society? How is it that all of us, who have played with gender toys have not become monsters like you see in Beit Shemesh? Why is it that you only find it really in the charedi community? Because the problem with the charedi community has nothing to do with playing patterns in their &lt;i&gt;early years&lt;/i&gt;. It&#039;s their segregation of the sexes in their later years and rabbinic voices their hear that teach them women are only there to support their torah study. I wish you wouldn&#039;t ignore this part. I also can&#039;t understand how you can read:

So blithely indulging — let alone exploiting — stereotypically gendered play patterns may have a more negative long-term impact on kids’ potential than parents imagine. 

and agree with that. I mean, are you serious? Do you ever look at the people writing this stuff and question their agenda? Do you ever wonder if possibly this is just more of those on the left-of-center ideology to sort of diminish masculine/feminine traits? &quot;Males in generally are less nurturing, so lets transform them into more nurturing creatures.&quot; (One should probably ask if that is a good thing). &quot;Girls are too girly, so lets masculinize them.&quot;

There is a difference between healthy interaction (which luckily those of us that went to public schools, had) vs. giving boys American Girl dolls. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps girls were always interested in LEGO. My wife tells me that when she was young her mother had to buy her girl LEGO because her older brothers wouldn&#039;t share their LEGO with her. So she didn&#039;t play with LEGO because her brothers wouldn&#039;t share with her, not because she didn&#039;t want to play. Though admittedly as a child my wife was a bit of a tomboy. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is the relevant part from the article:

&lt;i&gt;Every experience, every interaction, every activity — when they laugh, cry, learn, play — strengthens some neural circuits at the expense of others, and the younger the child the greater the effect. Consider: boys from more egalitarian homes are more nurturing toward babies. Meanwhile, in a study of more than 5,000 3-year-olds, girls with older brothers had stronger spatial skills than both girls and boys with older sisters.

At issue, then, is not nature or nurture but how nurture becomes nature: the environment in which children play and grow can encourage a range of aptitudes or foreclose them. So blithely indulging — let alone exploiting — stereotypically gendered play patterns may have a more negative long-term impact on kids’ potential than parents imagine. And promoting, without forcing, cross-sex friendships as well as a breadth of play styles may be more beneficial. There is even evidence that children who have opposite-sex friendships during their early years have healthier romantic relationships as teenagers.&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok. Now where did I misunderstand you? I agreed. But what does this have to do with having boys play with barbie during their &quot;malleable years?&quot; (which is the point of the article)

There is no connection between girls sticking to girls toys and boys to boys toys, to boys becoming monsters in their later  years. What causes these monsters, is the total segregation of the sexes, in later grades and yeshiva, not what they played when they were three years old. If that WAS the case, you would see more such monsters in the secular world, since basically everyone has grown up with gender toys.

Since when does  interactions between the sexes require little children to play with opposite toys? Did you GO to public school actually?]]></description>
