		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;
I never accused any circle of having wife swapping clubs as the norm.  I certainly do not believe its THE norm.  &lt;b&gt;I said it is A norm, and qualified it by saying we are immune to it and no longer react with any sort of moral shock.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Are you nuts? Which society doesn&#039;t react to such a thing with shock?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I never accused any circle of having wife swapping clubs as the norm.  I certainly do not believe its THE norm.  I said it is A norm, and qualified it by saying we are immune to it and no longer react with any sort of moral shock.  I think you missed what I was saying.  Nobody goes from 0 to swapping without  inappropriate interactions.  That is what they want to avoid and obviously the sometimes catastrophic end result of those interactions.

I agree there are costs to their choice, and I am sure they do as well, but that does not make it wrong.  You disagree with their choice, I may or may not.  All I am saying is that it is for each to decide how to weigh their choice and one cannot be told they are wrong for that choice.

2.  I did not mean every women, but a vast number are.  I do not blame them nor their husbands or any other men.  They are combating a multi-billion dollar advertising industry which is telling them to dress provocatively. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. Wife-swapping clubs are not the norm in MO circles, and they are not the inevitable result of men and women having conversations with each other. Men and women may interact, become attracted, and get carried away. That is the problem that the separation is intended to prevent. When you invite people to join your &quot;club,&quot; you are clearly engaging in deliberate action and not just being carried away by your attraction/emotions. 

There may be a problem of telling boys/men that they are helpless in the presence of a woman. If you&#039;re always told that you&#039;re helpless, you will be. They don&#039;t have to socialize with women, and I don&#039;t think Rabbi Fink was suggesting that they do. The point is that they have to know how to deal appropriately with situations where women are present, since they will be in such situations.

2. Almost all women (and probably men as well) want to be good-looking, but that doesn&#039;t mean they all are trying to attract men. Some women dress to attract men, some women dress to impress women, some women wear what&#039;s comfortable. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1.  Precisely my point, it is a cost benefit analysis.  You cannot say that one way is more right than the other.  There are a myriad of factors that go into every cost and benefit that change from one community to the next.  If you would like the facts I can give you my friends contact information and you may ask her yourself.  I am not trying to claim RWOJ has it better/greater/smarter.  I said they have their priorities and want to follow a certain lifestyle.  You are against them choosing such a lifestyle.  I am not referring to fringe extremists who believe they must spit on an 8 year old to prove a point.  I am referring to the world you were once part of and understood and appreciated as well meaning and respectful.

As for the wife swapping rumor, to me it is not a rumor.  I heard from someone firsthand who was approached by a friend shortly after moving into a community where I live, to join a &quot;wife swapping club&quot; (his words I mean no insult to anyone).  So while to many it is a rumor, it is a very real occurrence.  And yes this has a very real relation to the restrictions I am discussing.  These couples who are falling prey to temptation begin with couple interaction. So yes there is a very really relation to these restrictions.  In a realm of restriction these interactions that begin as innocent and continue to inappropriate and, unfortunately, in too many cases, end in terrible outcomes, are far fewer.

&quot;Moreover, the RWOJ community does in fact engage in pursuits outside the daled amos shel halacha and it would serve them well to be better equipped to dealing with the reality of a mixed world&quot;. Is this to say that halacha requires separation and no inter-gender contact.  I don&#039;t understand our point here other than there is what to gain form training people how to deal with inter gender relationships on all levels.  This may be true but according to their cost benefit analysis it seems they feel its not  worth the training.  That is their choice and the same way you resent when they push their beliefs on you, they resent when you push your beliefs on them.

2. &quot;Provocative is in the eye of the beholder.&quot;  It may be to some degree, but it is certainly in the hands of the one dressing with intent that way.  To say women don&#039;t dress to attract the eyes of men is to argue that water is not water.  You seem to be defining provocatively as an outright blatant attempt to do more than attract a man.  I do not believe that in the law school school where you are the women don&#039;t dress trying to attract men.  I had a long discussion with a balas teshuvah about mode of dress and she described to me how she would dress when she was a teenager, and while not provocative in the sense you seem to be defining it, it was all about attracting the boys.  And again I am not referring to the 8 year old.  To say that married women are not trying to attract the eyes of other men in today&#039;s orthodox society, and by this I mean the entire spectrum, is impossible. Unless you have your head in the sand.  I can share with you  link of a forum discussing this issue just email me if you want it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. Like everything in life, there is a cost / benefit analysis.

The benefit is, per your fact-less assertion, that there is less infidelity in RWOJ communities AND that this lower rate of infidelity is CAUSED by enhanced strictness on mixing of the genders. The costs are numerous. Who is to say that the default position of restricting all mixing of genders is worth the cost?

Moreover, the RWOJ community does in fact engage in pursuits outside the daled amos shel halacha and it would serve them well to be better equipped to dealing with the reality of a mixed world.

Rumors of spouse swapping are as old as any other rumors. It happens from time to time. But again, there is nothing to indicate that it has any relation to the restriction you are defending.

2. Provocative is in the eye of the beholder. The majority of well educated, professional type women that I have encountered do not dress provocatively. They may not be following the letter of the halachic standards but that is not to say that they are dressed seductively. There is a gap between the two and I daresay, a heavy overlap as well. As there are plenty of people who follow the halacha and still manage to be provocative.

Certainly, 8 year old girls who ARE dressed as per the halacha mandates are NOT provocative. In such instances the onus is ABSOLUTELY on the man not to be aroused. And if he cannot help it, he needs professional help.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. &quot;The rationale is usually something like “if men and women fraternize together, it will lead to sin”. But the truth is that men and women socialize together all the time and they don’t sin. Yet, this perception persists in the RWOJ community.&quot;No one ever said it will always lead to sin, but it does lead to sin SOMETIMES.  The goal is to minimize the occurrences.  Where there is social interaction the numbers will be greater.  A friend who is not from the RWOJ, as you would apply a label, recently mentioned to me the common occurrence of intentional premarital relations in her circles.  The interactions between men and women in her circles are socially encouraged and yet they are engaging in forbidden relationships according to all.  Yet people are blinded from seeing a far more dangerous issue by the hate for the RWOJ.  Accept that they have their priorities and you (the reader, poster, etc ...) have yours.   In the communities surrounding where I leave, spouse swapping is an unfortunate norm.  While all agree it is not acceptable we have all become immune it and brush it aside with the reaction of &quot;yeah it happens around here&quot;.  The sanctity of a marriage is akin to building a world, and the destruction of one akin to the destruction of a world.  It is wrong that these RWOJ want to protect their families?

2. &quot;…the Talmud, the basis for Jewish law, offers a perhaps surprising answer: It places the responsibility for controlling men’s licentious thoughts about women squarely on the men.&quot;
 Yes the responsibility for one&#039;s thought rests solely on himself, but there is the issur of &quot;lifnei iver lo sitein michshol&quot; Before a blind man do not place a stumbling block.  The women are accountable for dressing immodestly and provocatively as well.  One cannot say the men must turn a blind eye when a woman walks in &quot;flaunting&quot; herself.  The onus is on the women as well.  Don&#039;t be so naive claiming innocence for the women.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. &quot; I don’t think the complete social separation of men and women automatically reduces people to sex object. I do think this is one possible result of many.&quot; - yes, maybe in the softer version of RWOJ that you grew up in. But in Mea Shearim and New Square, is he still wrong?

2. &quot;We were discussing the difference between this kind of celebration and one outside the RWOJ community.&quot; - I was at some event in someines home, and the men and women were on two sides of the same room with no barrier, and when some rabbi showed up, they put something there until he left. 

3. I agree, its uncomfortable when things like this are in the Times or general media, but when stories are just kept in the Jewish media nothing changes. RWOJ are not embarrassed when we attack them on blogs, they only feel shame when the Bnei Edom pick up the stories, that is when they are spurred to change, sincerely or not. ]]></description>
