		<description><![CDATA[Very nice.

One small issue with phrasing -

&lt;i&gt;However, this lesson was not meant for the Mitzrim alone. It is really intended for us.&lt;/i&gt;

When someone asserts that a lesson is being taught to someone by hurting someone else, I get uncomfortable. But if the second sentence here were changed to &quot;It is &lt;b&gt;also&lt;/b&gt; intended for us&quot;, my discomfort would be lessened. It would also fit better with the first sentence.

Shabbat Shalom all.
