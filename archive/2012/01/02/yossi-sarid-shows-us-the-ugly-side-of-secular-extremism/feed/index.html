		<description><![CDATA[Rav Hershel Schachter shlita gave over the following story (I really wish I remembered the name of the Rav but unfortunately I forgot): A certain Rav would give what he felt the halacha was and then explain other opinions.  one day a talmid asked what the reasoning for the naturei karta was.  the Rav said they are crazy. taken aback, the talmid was curious.  some time later, the talmid spent a Shabbos with a family member with ties to NK.  As they were walking they passed an Israeli police officer and stated &quot;if only I had the courage to live up to my obligation to kill him, but unfortunately we dont always fulfill all the mitzvos we are supposed to.&quot;  The talmid then figured out his Rav&#039;s point: they are crazy.
after giving this story over, Rav Schachter continued to explain why everything that the instigators in Beit Shemesh were doing were outside of the realm of halacha and called them crazy.  Rav Schachter is one of the top qualified, if not the top qualified halachik authorities in America and the world, and is quite religious.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sarid&#039;s article was what it was. But let&#039;s go back to what you wrote. I hope this is a fair summary of parts of your post:

1) the texts do exist
2) most Orthodox Jews don&#039;t see women the way these texts indicate they should
3) other than apologetics, there appears to be no authoritative Orthodox way of dealing with them 

Why hasn&#039;t rabbinic leadership yet applied itself to this important task? My sense is that this is because they considered misogyny a lesser evil than feminism/acting like the &quot;Reformim.&quot;

But beyond the misogynistic statements about women in our tradition - things that clearly offend our modern sensibilities - what about the halachic structures that appear to relegate women to second-class status, such as Edut, Kiddushin/Gerushin/Aguna, Minyan, Tzniyut, Kol Isha, etc.? Does it not make sense to see these structures and those statements as being somehow related? Perhaps these structures only make sense (at least without engaging in apologetics) when one views women that way, but maybe they don&#039;t make sense anymore in a world where women are seen as equal to men.

If you haven&#039;t yet done so, I recommend Rabbi David Hartman&#039;s &quot;The God Who Hates Lies.&quot; He has a chapter about this very issue.

Also, one might say that it is modern, western life that has had the greatest impact on women&#039;s status in Orthodox Judaism. But the Haredi world, by and large, rejects much, if not all, of this influence. The &quot;Torani/Haredi Leumi&quot; world does as well.

Is it a surprise then, when some segments of these communities elevate in importance those rabbinic statements and positions that seem to run most counter to modern views of women? Since being reactionary is part of their hashkafa, the advancement of women in contemporary society drives them toward the more retrogade elements of the Jewish tradition.

		<description><![CDATA[For the Talmudic scholar Yossi Sarid it is too early for Purim Torah
I would guess he has no problem going to a daati doctor despite the medicine recorded in the Talmud?

He reads the Talmud as  a closed book . An academic exercise for him. Although I have met a few misguided people who say they do read the Talmud as a closed book  that is not how it is taught or passed down. From the Chafetz Chayim who famously dealt with woman&#039;s learning, to The Tzitz Eliezer (who deals with man walking behind woman by quoting several rishonim) to every teacher I ever had. 

What Sarid has done is make me think of a new definition for m&#039;nuval b&#039;rshus ha&#039;torah ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Saducees, and later the Karaites, twisted Jewish scripture and law to a literalist extreme.  They are outside of observant Judaism.

The early Christians twisted Jewish scripture and law to negate much of Jewish law, and insert a completely new definition of moshiach (son of G-d, kaveyachol).  They are outside of observant Judaism.

All of the liberal &quot;movements&quot; twisted Jewish scripture and law to fit in with the secular progressive goyim.  They are outside of observant Judaism.

A small band of fools, dressed up as Charedi Jews, have twisted Jewish scripture and law to condone (if not command) the verbal assault of little girls walking to and from school.

They too are outside of observant Judaism.  I cannot eat their food, rely on their testimony, or drink any wine they have poured.  Neither do I have any obligation to spin apologetics for them.

So a G-d hating leftist like Sarid chooses to twist Jewish scripture and law in the same way as a small band of fools.  I&#039;m not surprised.  It serves his agenda well.

I&#039;m glad that Rabbi Fink did not answer his perverted understanding of Jewish scripture and law  point by point.  

&lt;i&gt;&quot;But it would be wise for our rabbinic leadership (and by our rabbinic leadership, I mean the orthodox Jewish leadership from across the spectrum) to formulate responses and interpretations or dismissals of these texts.&lt;/i&gt;

Totally unnecessary.  The Torah writes that anyone who violates shabbat must be stoned to death.  If anyone carried that out today, would we need to &quot;formulate responses and interpretations&quot;?  It is self-evident how observant Judaism deals with that text, along with all of the texts quoted by Mr. Sarid.
