		<description><![CDATA[I will try to listen to the show later.

Meanwhile, I am skeptical that there is any logic to this system. Some murderers and violent criminals get pardoned. Clark has not. Making a blanket statement that since the &quot;crime remains&quot; she shouldn&#039;t be pardoned is an impossible statement to reconcile with reality. EVERY criminal&#039;s crime still remains. And yet, some get pardoned. Like I said, he makes no sense.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure it does, you should listen to his show like I suggested. 

The only question is whether reformation in jail warrants a release, and his opinion is no. He mentioned that as Gov. he pardoned more people than any other NY Gov ever, so I dont think there was a question of being tough of pardons. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just heard Gov. Patterson discuss this case on his radio show and I completely agree with his decision to not end her sentence. As the Gov. explained, a person changing in jail does not warrant communal forgiveness. We should expect that during ones incarceration they reflect upon their actions and come to some sort of a realization that what they did was wrong. Whether that happens in most cases is besides the point.  In the end, she commited the crime, she didn&#039;t take the plea deal, due to years of being in prison she has obviously had time to reflect, but her crime still remains. 

I recommend that you obtain the podcast of his show from this morning (710 WOR NYC).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[She reformed while incarcerated in prison.  If she had not been captured, she would have had other choices available and could have gone on to commit more crimes or escape to another country like one of her Black Liberation Army cohorts.  Driving a getaway car for someone who commits murder makes you an accessory in a murder.  If it&#039;s enough for her to say &quot;I&#039;m sorry and I&#039;m now a changed person&quot;, what about the man who pulled the trigger?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was going to write something longer, but I figured keeping it short and sweet is better. In general, I believe if a person truly changes and can be a responsible member of society, clemency should be awarded. The exception should be if life is vanquished. On an individual level, it&#039;s great that someone can do personal shuva, but the crime is too heinous. If chazal can say that by saving one life, it is as if you saved the world, then the opposite is true as well. ]]></description>

Combination of factors. Victims families want to see her in prison, it makes them feel better, law enforcement unions have united on this issue as well, it is assumed that she is technically not eligible for clemency though her lawyer has shown otherwise... etc]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As I noted in a previous conversation somewhere, this is a sad story. However I am wondering if the clemency board is following some particular point of law (that may be changed by the legislature) or if they are simply being hard-hearted? (or perhaps are still being pressured by relatives of the victims)]]></description>
