		<description><![CDATA[No one says that a 100% Black neighborhood needs more diversity.

No one says that a 100% Asian neighborhood needs more diversity.

No one says that a 100% Jewish neighborhood needs more diversity.

According to anti-Whites, they are already 100% diverse.

All White neighborhoods and only White neighborhoods need to be more diverse. White neighborhoods only stop needing to be more diverse when there are no White people left in them.

Anti-racist is a codeword people HIDE BEHIND to be anti-White.

		<description><![CDATA[They&#039;re not being forced into giving up their practices.  The Karaites maintain their own practices in Israel.  So do the Shomronim (Cutim).  They each have their own respective rabbinates, that operate independent of the Israeli Rabbinate.

However, neither the Karaites or Shomronim are considered Orthodox Jews.

The Ethiopians have a choice.  They can continue to follow their religion, or they can follow Orthodox Judaism, but they can&#039;t do both.

Their method of animal slaughter is not kosher, they bring animal offerings outside of the Temple, they require women in niddah to live in huts outside of the family home.

Their religion cannot coexist as a part of normative observant Judaism.

The State of Israel guarantees freedom of religion.  Christians, Muslims, Druze, Karaites, Shomronim, Reform, Scientology, Bahai - all of these foreign religions exist in Israel, and all of their adherents are free to practice their religions as they see fit.

They just can&#039;t pretend that any of the above follow halacha.

I am impressed that many Ethiopians in Israel underwent conversion and chose to keep halacha.  They value (re)joining Klal Yisrael more than they value their old ways.

If any of the Ethiopians want to continue practicing their own religion, they may continue to do so.  However, it seems that almost all Ethiopian Israelis today are either secular, or observers of halacha - and that is their choice.]]></description>
