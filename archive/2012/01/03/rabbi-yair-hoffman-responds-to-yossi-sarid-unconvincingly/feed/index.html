		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for stopping by and commenting. You asked:

&lt;i&gt;Do you believe that there are statements in the Talmud that may not reflect current social mores, but are still binding, immutable, and even wise? Or do you feel that anything in the Talmud that doesn&#039;t reflect a modern sense of morality really is just waiting to be &quot;changed&quot;, and waiting to &quot;adapt and evolve&quot;? &lt;/i&gt;
I believe, as the Rambam holds, that any halachic enactment by the Beis Din HaGadol of R&#039; Yehuda HaNassi as interpreted by the Talmud is binding. Statements of advice, philosophy, science, history are not binding.
&lt;i&gt;Do you believe that the chachmei hatalmud were upright, moral, just individuals whose comments may have a much deeper meaning than what you&#039;ve understood?&lt;/i&gt;

I believe that they were very moral and just. It&#039;s possible that their statement had a deeper meaning. I don&#039;t know what it was, nor do I think anyone 1600 years later can know what it was!

&lt;i&gt;Putting aside the political incorrectness of it, can you tolerate the concept (which is practically applicable in Halacha) that we would have an order in saving lives, and that we wouldn&#039;t be mechalel shabbos for a non-Jew if not for the hatred that it would cause? Do you think that should change?&lt;/i&gt;

I think for purposes of Kidush Hashem and &quot;eiva&quot; we would advise someone in 2012 to save the person no matter who they were. Or at least I hope.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting thoughts. I actually do think that some of these comments would get you booted out of Orthodox Judaism, but I have a different problem with it. It is certainly true that some of the comments of the Talmud reflect the way that society was back then, but the question is which, and who has the right to make that call. Also, as you pointed out, it really will not answer all the questions, and so I&#039;m not sure what you will end up gaining, except having a more refined, subtle form of apologetics.

There is no doubt that many of the things that chazal, or even contemporary Halacha, have enacted are actually to make sure that we are not behind the times in regard to morality. For example, a convert is not allowed to marry his sister who also converts, &quot;so that they shouldn&#039;t say that we are less moral than them&quot;. The idea of a Pruzbul also changed the laws of long term lending very much. However, the question that really remains, and actually jumps out of this post, is: Do you believe that there are statements in the Talmud that may not reflect current social mores, but are still binding, immutable, and even wise? Or do you feel that anything in the Talmud that doesn&#039;t reflect a modern sense of morality really is just waiting to be &quot;changed&quot;, and waiting to &quot;adapt and evolve&quot;?

		<description><![CDATA[Andy, 

I suppose, in a way, I am replying to Sarid and others like him.

I mean to say  - if Jewish law was really so oppressive of women, why would 21st century, highly educated, financially independent women stick around?

Mr. Sarid wouldn&#039;t have to go very far to ask  (if he were capable of the intellectual honesty necessary to ask such a question).  MK Tzipi Hotovely is a young, religious woman, who was the youngest person ever to be elected to serve in the Knesset.

She has also been at the forefront of the demonstrations against the black-hatted terrorists.

Does Mr. Sarid suggest that MK Hotovely is too stupid to realize that her religion teaches men to spit at and harass little girls on their way to school?  Or, perhaps, it doesn&#039;t really teach that at all.

By the way, a cheresh is a deaf-mute.  He has no way of communicating.  A person who has never been able to communicate would indeed be exempt from mitzvos.  If someone can successfully teach that person to communicate, he is no longer a cheresh, because now he can be taught how to perform the mitzvos.

Avraham asked G-d if He would save S&#039;dom for various amounts of tzaddikim.  The Bnot Tzelophehad asked a beit din if they could inherit.

We can learn from this that it is permissible, even praiseworthy, to approach G-d or a beit din if one is bothered by halacha l&#039;maaseh.

If G-d doesn&#039;t respond, and/or if the beit din upholds the halacha as is, then we have two options:

- return to our learning and find greater evidence that the halacha should change, and resubmit it.

-accept the halacha as is, whether or not we like it.

I don&#039;t particularly like the laws of kashrut.  It&#039;s annoying that I can&#039;t go out to eat with my friends.  It&#039;s cumbersome to have to pack a cooler full of food if I want to go on a road trip.  It&#039;s frustrating that my non-frum and non-Jewish friends hesitate to eat out with me in the few kosher restaurants that are available, because the food there is so much more expensive than the non-kosher restaurants.

I don&#039;t like the laws, and I don&#039;t have to like them.  I keep them because I know that G-d has commanded me to keep them.  I don&#039;t even try to weasel out of it, and falsely justify eating in a non-kosher restaurant, by saying &quot;I&#039;ll only eat vegetarian.&quot;, or &quot;these laws were for a different time.&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[So the statements just reflect the view at the time, but the laws are timeless?

Are there not examples of the laws changing too? What of the changed status of the deaf and blind, and how that changed their standing within halacha?

And what of laws whose interpretation and application are based on statements such as &quot;a woman would rather be married than live alone?&quot; Or rulings based, at least in part, on svara that presumably reflects the dayan&#039;s view of the world?

You had me until your last few paragraphs, and then you veered decidedly in the direction of apologetics.

There is a qualitative difference, for me at least, and I suspect others as well, between the laws governing Kohanim and tuma/tahara, the laws of Mamzerim (that condemn them and their descendants to marginal status in the community forever because of the actions of their parents), and the various restrictions on women that place them in second-class status vis-a-vis men and are strikingly similar to the restrictions on minors, slaves, and the feeble-minded.

And I am not sure I understand what you mean by &quot;Contemporary observant Jewish women understand and respect halacha.&quot; As observant women, they certainly do OBSERVE halacha - that&#039;s a tautology.

But there are countless observant men and women who do not UNDERSTAND halacha in general, or at least specific parts of it, as well as many observant men and women who are deeply TROUBLED by some of what halacha they do understand.

Do you mean to say if one is bothered by something in the halacha, that there is something wrong with that person? That one who is truly observant just accepts the existence of all halachic restrictions? I guess I will have to go back and re-read the stories of Avraham and S&#039;dom, or B&#039;not Tzelophehad, because it seems we are not supposed to use whatever faculties HaShem has given us for discerning right and wrong, just and unjust - neither for ourselves nor for others. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Talmuds make two kinds of statements.  Halachic statements (statements which define and influence actual Jewish law) and non-halachic statements.

The non-halachic statements reflect only the view of the world at that time (3rd and 4th century Israel and Babylon).  We are not obligated to these points of view.  Sometimes they offer timeless insights into the nature of humanity, while other times they reflect the norms of a society that is not ours.

The halachic statements of the Talmuds, specifically those that are cited when formulating our codes of practical Jewish Law (most notably the Shulchan Aruch) are binding upon us.  

Observant Jewish women today received advanced religious and secular educations.  They are doctors, lawyers, CEO&#039;s, and other modes of career professionals.  They can remain single or get married.  They can have children, or not.  All the while, they remain members in good standing of any observant Jewish community.

They are unencumbered by the non-halachic statements regarding the nature of women.

However, these highly intelligent, educated, and successful women will not testify in a Jewish court, in such cases that our Law does not allow it.  These women do not seek to be counted in a minyan.  They will not get remarried, or have a sexual relationship with another man, if they are still married - even if that marriage has all but dissolved, but no get has been issued.

Contemporary observant Jewish women understand and respect halacha.  It is not only women who have restrictions.  A Kohen cannot attend his own grandfather&#039;s funeral.  A mamzer is severly limited as to who he can marry.  This is our Law, and the fact that modern society has a different view does not exempt us from following our Law.

The G-d haters of the world will always pervert our Law and our practice of it.  &quot;...there is nothing new under the sun&quot;  Ecclesiastes 1:9 

For the committed Jew, our challenge lies not with refutation of the G-d haters, but with our own communities, and ultimately, ourselves.  We must engage the world in which we live, while remaining faithful to our Law.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why the fuss? The Talmud was written by men almost 2000 years ago. And 2000 years ago, almost everyone (certainly everyone in the region where the Talmud was written) believed such things about women. Today we know that it isn&#039;t true. Just like we know that nits/lice don&#039;t spontaneously generate. And just like we know that the &quot;Rakia&quot; isn&#039;t exactly as described. And like we have better estimates of the age of the earth. Etc.

Not really a big deal.

The big deal is that Orthodoxy changes very slowly and it may take a few generations for the necessary corrections to take place.]]></description>

Just like we know that nits/lice don&#8217;t spontaneously generate. And just like we know that the &#8220;Rakia&#8221; isn&#8217;t exactly as described. And like we have better estimates of the age of the earth. Etc.</p>
<p>Not really a big deal.</p>
<p>The big deal is that Orthodoxy changes very slowly and it may take a few generations for the necessary corrections to take place.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Bravo to you, Rabbi Fink, and bravo to Charlie Hall&#039;s comment:  &quot;And that is indeed the problem. Nobody in the Charedi world, and few in the Modern Orthodox world, is willing to admit that the rules for Judaism have indeed changed. And some of these involve major issues of Torah law. For example, the sages of the talmud would never have countenanced  limited-liability corporations, yet Jews in large numbers invest in them and benefit from them today.

Until we can approach these issues with some intellectual honesty we will lose these arguments.&quot;
I wish I had the knowledge to say more with some intelligence, but I&#039;m glad to recognize the intellectual honesty in your article, and Charlie Hall&#039;s comments. I hope to read more from both of you on these issues in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#039;Rabbi Hoffman employs the “it is literal but it’s not so bad” argument. Meaning, yes it is true, but many other cultures and countries have had similar laws. Okay. Fair enough.&#039;

Except that there are at least two documented cases of Jewish female monarchs: Shelomit, and Helene. And it isn&#039;t at all clear that this rule applies to anything other than a monarch.

&quot; It is true that the Talmud says this &quot;

Also not clear that it applies; otherwise one could not explain Devorah and Beruriah.


&quot; the law that prohibits women from testifying in court or becoming a judge&quot;

R&#039;Uziel z&#039;tz&#039;l wrote that a woman can serve as a dayan as long as the parties to the case agree. And that was in a famous tshuvah on women voting that has been universally accepted by the Orthodox community.


&quot;the Talmud’s statement that allows men to divorce without his wife’s consent &quot;

That was true 1500 years ago, but no longer after Rabbeinu Gershom. 


&quot; for some, saying this amounts to kefira or at least knocks one out of orthodox Judaism.  &quot;

And that is indeed the problem. Nobody in the Charedi world, and few in the Modern Orthodox world, is willing to admit that the rules for Judaism have indeed changed. And some of these involve major issues of Torah law. For example, the sages of the talmud would never have countenanced  limited-liability corporations, yet Jews in large numbers invest in them and benefit from them today.

		<description><![CDATA[I was wondering why you had not addressed my post, but now I see why - you are bothered by the same things. Rabbonim who clearly have enough standing to make the statements/changes to square the tradition with how you see women, don&#039;t make the statements. And many who THOUGHT they had the standing to make the statements/changes, and then made them, have been marginalized within Orthodoxy. All in all, isn&#039;t this somewhat damning? That is ultimately what R&#039; Hartman concludes. And how do we explain it? Maybe the Orthodox world doesn&#039;t really WANT to repudiate these texts because somewhere inside, they do express what people think. Or maybe there is recognition that these texts are the logic that underlies various halachic structures and institutions that Orthdoxy feels must be maintained and protected? Or maybe Orthodoxy&#039;s denunciations of Conservative Judaism and Feminism have painted it into a box, and it cannot simultaneously be intellectually and morally honest and still meet its own definitions of authenticity and fidelity? In any case, Sarid may have been swinging a sledgehammer, but he seems to have struck an Achilles heel.]]></description>
