		<description><![CDATA[Well, many orthodox Jews who serve in the Army have small kinderlach and keep their weapons at home (Hesder, Bnai Akiva, UTJ, etc). So there is obviously a precedent and one couldnt argue that it&#039;s only in a zman of sakonos nafshos because not all trainees are in the shtachim....

C&#039;mon, I&#039;m asking for a ruling and if it requires me joining your shul and then getting one as your congregnt, I may very well do so! :)

Oh yeah...knifes are FAR more dangerous and accessible to the youngin&#039;s...look at the cutlery block in your own kitchen ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wish we could learn something.  Some of the comments I heard in shul were disgusting.  They were not on the tragedy itself, but along the lines of ...&quot;an open casket funeral, oy the poor kids&quot;... and..&quot;an interfaith service?  that&#039;s what what they&#039;re those kids are bringing to Olam HaEmes?&quot;...  There is such an overwhelming lack of sensitivity it&#039;s shocking.  Wish you could do a random poll question on your blog.  The question, with a binary answer, would be &quot;Does Hashem love non Jews?&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Judaism very strongly promotes creating this kind of empathetic society. We need to do a better job amongst ourselves to play our role as a light unto the nations.



Does it? Maybe new age Judaism but I don&#039;t see anything in mainstream Judaism. How much of our halachic and hashkafic literature has in it horrible things against gentiles? I don&#039;t see Judaism as carrying much for promoting expanding this kind if empathetic society. It care about empathy.....toward its own and  doesn&#039;t put a whole lot to others]]></description>
