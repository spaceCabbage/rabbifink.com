		<description><![CDATA[Quote from Ibn Ezra regarding the different wording in the two records of the aseres hadibros (courtesy of R\&#039; Dr. Yonatan Grossman from the VBM website - article translated by a student):

\&quot;Biblical language sometimes includes lengthy explanations, and sometimes makes do with brief words that the listener can understand. Know that the words are like the body and the meaning is like the soul, and the body is a vessel for the soul.  So, too, all scholars of any language try to maintain the meaning, and they don’t care which words they use as long as they communicate the same meaning.\&quot;



So, according to Ibn Ezra, it seems that literary precision was not necessarily utilized in the writing of the Torah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The proof that is brought for this is that Dina is called Yaakov\&#039;s daughter leading Chazal to conclude that he was responsible for her being a girl. However, this contradicts the famous Chazal in Berachos (quoted by Rashi in Vayetze) that Dina was conceived as a BOY and only turned into a girl after Leah davened (so that Rachel would have at least 2 sons). Clearly, according to the Gemara in Berachos we cannot bring any proof from Dina that the father is responsible for the child being a girl as Dina is the miraculous exception, conceived as a boy and turning into a girl later.  I have a fascinating post about this &lt;a href=&quot;http://jewishworker.blogspot.co.uk/2005/12/who-was-mother-of.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Who was the mother of דינה?&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>

Maybe there was a habit of sneaking into peoples bedrooms and hiding under the bed while a couple had relations and taking data for later analysis?

		<description><![CDATA[The very next gemara (moving onto amud B) is a parallel which says that a man can get boys by holding back from being zoreiya until his wife is mazria.

		<description><![CDATA[About the 600,000 thing: I vaguely recall the number 603,550 from yeshiva. I\&#039;m not sure if that number is mentioned anywhere in the Torah, but it\&#039;s definitely mentioned in the Talmud (Sotah). So there seems to be some recognition that there was rounding going on.

Unless that number represents something else? I forget.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Obviously, this important terms here are an english translation of Latin or Greek. I would posit that like Chazal the Romans used the same word for male and female orgasm.  It boggles the mind to think that either Chazal or the Romans failed to notice that women do not emit semen as the modern word is understood. 


I think that the Romans and Chazal (maybe this was the height of obstetrics back in the day) likely believed that if the women climaxed before the man it increased the likelihood of a boy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here:

To Get A Boy (According to Shettles):

[...]

Women have an orgasm: According to Shettles, female orgasm increases the alkaline secretions in the vagina that are favorable to the Y-chromosome carrying sperm. Shettles recommends having an orgasm before or at the same time as the male partner.

		<description><![CDATA[I guess equivalent is strong word. I meant the female analogue to emitting semen (i.e. orgasm). I don\&#039;t think it was ever thought by any group of people at any time that women actually emitted some sort of semen. I don\&#039;t think R\&#039;Ammi could possibly have meant that.

		<description><![CDATA[Can you find me an article for the debunking? I had seen an article disputing previous findings relating to ovulation (cited in Yehuda Levi\&#039;s book) but I haven\&#039;t seen an article relating to the orgasm pshat. 


I actually thought it was poshut pshat that mazra\&#039;as means orgasm.  It is the corollary to the male mazra\&#039;as which definitely means the male orgasm. What do you think it means?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have my own pshat in Yakov\&#039;s children.  But the real kasha by Yakov\&#039;s children is not the 70 v. 69.  The Ibin Ezra\&#039;s answer is very simple for that.  The 70 includes Yakov himself (he is presumably a \&quot;nefesh in Bais Yakov\&quot;).  Rather the question which drives the \&quot;Yocheved\&quot; pshat is that in counting Leah\&#039;s offspring there are 32 names listed and the Torah says 33.

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink, you appear to be assuming that Chazal (or the scientist they relied on) were wrong in this case (assuming this was meant to be a scientific statement and not a \&quot;reward\&quot; for pleasuring one\&#039;s wife), but that it not clearly true.  It is unclear what exactly R\&#039; Ammi is referring to when he says \&quot;Isha mazraas techilah\&quot; and it is unclear if he is saying that this is tendency (i.e. it is more likely) or it is ironclad causation.
