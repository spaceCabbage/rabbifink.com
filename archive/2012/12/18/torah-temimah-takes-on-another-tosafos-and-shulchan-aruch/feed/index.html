		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a Ritva that says that we only have to be concerned with jews suffering during famine etc.
That explains why Yaakov and family didn&#039;t need to avoid having relations due to so called &quot;random masses&quot; suffering from famine.
(I personally am not fond of interpretations that make it seem as though gentiles are not our concern,even to a arguably minor extent.)
On the other hand Yosef didn&#039;t know that his family had stockpiled food and wasnt affected by the famine,therefore he avoided relations during the famine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Torah Temimah has always been one of my favorite perushim. A particularly noteworthy commentary is coming up in Parshas Bo, regarding Makat Choshech. Contrary to Rashi who explains that the darkness was a palpable &quot;thickness&quot; that pervaded the air, the Torah Temimah suggests that Choshech was merely in the eyes of the Egyptians, and the mechanics of the plague were that they were afflicted with cataracts. I distinctly remember hearing that in Ner Yisroel, Rabbi Ruderman banned the Torah Temimah from the bais medrash because of this commentary, because it evidences a reluctance to explain the pshat with a miraculous occurrence (even though the Torah Temimah prefaces his remarks with &quot;לולי דמסתפינא&quot;), and that even to this day, Ner Yisroel has no copies in the bais, only in the stacks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reading the verse, it does seem to be a strange to note when the boys were born in relation to the famine. It&#039;s considered extra information. As you know, extra information gets darshaned.


I agree that the logical leap is lacking. But to Chazal it was not lacking. Or perhaps it was lacking and they weren&#039;t drawing a logical conclusion, rather they were making an observation and proposing a reason for the observation and it was later interpreted as a logical conclusion. Who knows?


But this is not a post about Talmudic exegesis. It&#039;s a post about post-Talmudic interpretation of the Talmud.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; The Torah goes out of its way to tell us that Joseph and his wife had two sons before the
years of famine began.

 

What does it mean for the Torah to “out of its way” to tell us something? It’s talking about what Yoseph was doing, gathering crops in preparation for the coming famine, and mentions
that he had two sons in that period. Why attach any significance at all to that? And even if it is significant, how does one make the logical leap that, because his sons were born before the famine, that means that he stopped sleeping with his wife during the famine? Perhaps the Torah is just telling us about a time in Yoseph’s life which was full of good things – he was made a powerful man, he gathered plentiful crops, and he had sons.

I know it’s heretical to say this about a gemara, but the entire premise is a bit ridiculous. Suppose I told you about a great restaurant I ate in as a teenager. Would you infer from the fact that I mentioned I was a teenager at the time that after I reached my twenties I refrained from eating in restaurants?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks.


I was once taught by a rebbe of mine (can&#039;t remember who) that one should always guess the pshat before reading Rashi and then after reading Rashi one should think about why Rashi learned differently.


I am going through the TT every week. I write about the most interesting TT I find in the parsha. I guess I am making mental notes about his methodology and his approach based on the other TTs I am reading. I don&#039;t believe I have the capacity to write intelligently on a subject like that. But who knows....?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Got it.  


BTW, this Torah Temimah stuff is great.  I hope you are keeping track of it, and thinking about unifying themses to his methodology or the like, because this is the stuff great books are made of (I am working on two such books with Rabbi Broyde now, and it has really opened my eyes to the scholarship/publication potential in this kind of stuff).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The reasoning for this rule is apparently that it is wrong to add the burden of additional children at a time where resources are scarce.&quot; 

I gather that this is your common-sense interpretation of the underlying rationale for the Gemarah&#039;s rule.  Wondering why you came to this conclusion:  Isn&#039;t Rashi&#039;s explanation the more obvious and textual one?  After all, the Gemarah emphasizes that one should not have marital relations during a famine, not that one should not father children during a famine.]]></description>
