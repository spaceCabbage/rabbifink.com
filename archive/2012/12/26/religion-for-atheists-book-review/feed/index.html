		<description><![CDATA[&#062;I am a married person, a mom, a foster and per adoptive mom, I am a woman, a social liberal, a mental health professional, a member of my town, state, country and of course a Jew and supporter of Israel.



Alain clearly knows that every atheist is part of what you describe here, and yet.....he is still proscribing exactly what I believe wouldn\&#039;t work with atheists in general. The reason is, being part of a particular address with friends in your state and having a profession is not the \&quot;group\&quot; he is advocating for nor the one I believe wouldn\&#039;t work. I\&#039;m talking apples. You\&#039;re talking lox]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I fail to even understand what you are complaining about anymore. You say your group is the human race? That means nothing to this conversation. Atheists in all these blogs continuously rile agains the \&quot;group-think\&quot; of religion.  That there is too much coercion upon the people. There is no such thing as group-think or specific dictated ritual in speaking of the human race. Nor about communities in general or about being mental health professional. How is this so hard to comprehend? I\&#039;m not even criticizing atheist. I am simply saying what Alain seeks is probably impossible for atheists in the general sense and why get has gotten criticized so much from atheists. You of all people would agree with me that religion sets up a different type of group dynamic that often stifles people in order for it to survive. I mean, just take a look at this post. Maybe you will understand what I am talking about in relation of how these atheists view what they deem as society coercing them to do something they don\&#039;t want.

		<description><![CDATA[HH, what does a prominent philosophy of \&quot;individualism\&quot; mean to you exactly if not people being out for themselves? Did I need a quote to paraphrase you?  And those running to America? It is for aspirations of self, usually economic actually. America is a place where people come to live their individual dreams or to help their immediate families. That is far from some group reason. If you put the group first, whatever that is, you stay in the group and help your group, no? Or do you leave your homeland, your church, to pursue greener pastures? Not that I am criticizing, as Mark said, my group is the human race. I am all for all humans succeeding, having economic, educational and opportunities for freedoms they can\&#039;t have elsewhere. 
This issue you have with atheists and group identify, where is it from? Just because a person doesn\&#039;t belong to a religious group doesn\&#039;t mean they aren\&#039;t a part of many meaningful communities that propel them to think about the needs of a group. I am a married person, a mom, a foster and per adoptive mom, I am a woman, a social liberal, a mental health professional, a member of my town, state, country and of course a Jew and supporter of Israel. These all make me a meaningful member of many communities, they give me purpose, something to fight for and groups that I am very much a part of.  Some of these groups I chose, some chose me. We all belong to many communities in our lives. Religion plays are larger or smaller role in the life of each person. It is not what determines whether we care about the greater good of humans in our group or about humans in general.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But that isn\&#039;t what we are talking about here. We are comparing it to the religious type of group dynamics that lend to rituals and rules to keep the group functioning. Liberal or Conservative atheists don\&#039;t function in the same way religious groups would. An atheist Conservative, for example, is simply someone that is \&quot;individualistic\&quot; in the same sense as an evangelical Conservative, which is, Freedom (liberty) from gov\&#039;t policy. That is hardly the individualism vs group that I am talking about. 


Calling the human race a group is so broad that the word \&quot;group\&quot; simply becomes pointless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;But a prominent \&quot;philosophy\&quot; (or use whatever term you want because I know you get so riled up) amongst atheists, just happens to be individualism as opposed to group identity and as so many would call it \&quot;societal coercion.\&quot;&lt;/i&gt;


I don\&#039;t think that is true at all. There are atheist liberals (who tend toward \&quot;group identity\&quot;) and there are atheist conservatives (who tend toward \&quot;individualism\&quot;), and there are those atheists in between. If anything, atheists tend to be more liberal and tend toward the government-sponsored type of group identity and group support. And for the humanist atheists, their group is \&quot;the human race\&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;I guess Holy Hyrax already believes them (us) to be, selfish, self serving, greedy and entirely out for ourselves.

How about this T.O. why don\&#039;t you provide a single quote from me that I have said that atheists are selfish, self serving and greedy? I am waiting. Feel free to email me. If not, I await your apology. 

&#062;Yet it is the American, the most religious of first world countries which are the more notoriously individualistic, greedy, material driven of all.

And yet awkwardly, the troubled parts of the world would sooner come to America for assistance then would run to the Danes and it is our culture that they still love and emulate. So yes, I would rather be part of this American culture that works like hell to earn materialistic dream then be like others that only worry about their vacation time being declared a human right and have others pay the bill]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The evolutionary needs for religion include civilizing people, promoting principles that help people to be pro social and coexist and to implement hierarchies of power (among other things).  There is no reason to believe that a person has to cling to religion to maintain pro social ideologies and behavior. If that were true atheists would all be what I guess Holy Hyrax already believes them (us) to be, selfish, self serving, greedy and entirely out for ourselves. Only the evidence isn\&#039;t there. There are whole countries outside of the US where the proportion of atheists in the population is much larger than in the US. Yet it is the American, the most religious of first world countries which are the more notoriously individualistic, greedy, material driven of all. There is no need to go backwards in time. The evolutionary needs of religion are still being met by the concepts of governmental law, communities and humanistic principles that continue to evolve as our moral sensibilities evolve. There is nothing to fear from moving away from religion. This sense of where religion came from and what purpose it served is nothing new. Today\&#039;s religious can understand the need for Greek \&quot;mythology\&quot; the same as today\&#039;s atheist can understand the reasons for currently still held by many religious beliefs systems. We aren\&#039;t clueless nor are we punching for some lawless, uncaring, do nothing for others because there is no reason to society. One does need to believe in a world to come to be a moral, ethic positive addition to the world during their lives.]]></description>
