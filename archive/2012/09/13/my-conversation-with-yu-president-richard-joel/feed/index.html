paradigm as an alternative to their current structure simply because it would
be an acknowledgement of their own failure to prepare the majority of their
students for life after Yeshiva.


 


Close. The
yeshivish world can ever acknowledge the YU paradigm as an alternative to their
current structure simply because it would be conceding that would be acceptable
for the majority of their students to have a life after Yeshiva. (As
opposed to the current ideal of life-long kollel.)

		<description><![CDATA[I wanted to comment on this issue as a black sheep of a family dug in deep in the Yeshivish world and as a parent of esentially three sons in YU (one in a YU affiliated in Israel 2 in YU in New York). I am very well aware of how the right views YU and for those who want to make the claim that they scoff at YU strictly based on it&#039;s gender laxities, you truly have no idea what you are talking about. Is that a factor of their derision? Certainly so-is it the underlying basis of their disdain? No even close. To be fair, I do think that most of them are just spouting of the gobbly-gook that they recieved from their own Rabbeim who of course knew not what THEY were talking about, but even more to the point, if you ask them, they would argue that the scholarship at YU is inferior. Unbeknownst to them, it could certainly be argued that there are more talmedeii chachomim giving shuir each day under their roof that most any other yeshiva in America. The amount of Torah scholarship that permeates their halls is astounding. That being said, I wanted to address the TuM issue. I do not think what PRJ said is new. I think if you study the writings of the Rav or even listen to his talmidim, the TuM approach has always been Shleymus, but just as the right has/had been hijacked by its mouthy &quot;chassidim&quot; who misrepresent what their haskafa is actually about, so to has TuM been hijacked by those who misrepresent its core philosophy and values. It is quite clear that when most people think of the term &quot;modern orthodox&quot; it has been represented to mean &#039;less orthodox&quot; and nothing could be further from the truth. However, what has been represented in teh culuture at large is a de-emphasizing of Torah Study and religious practice and therein lies the rub. Shleymous has always been the goal, it has just needed some repackaging and I hope that as more students of YU become more prominent in the Torah world (being that they are getting most of the Rabbi jobs available due to their preparedness for today&#039;s world) that idea will change in time. I do not believe the yeshivish world can ever acknowledge the YU paradigm as an alternative to their current structure simply because it would be an acknowledgement of their own failure to prepare the majority of their students for life after Yeshiva.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;He responded that the economic realities are making YU a more attractive option.&lt;/i&gt;


If he really said it this way, then it&#039;s a ridiculous statement. Charedim that want to escape the cycle of poverty that is generally (maybe &quot;often&quot; is a better word, in Israel, it&#039;s definitely &quot;generally&quot;) forced upon them by lack of education, they are hardly likely to turn to YU for a few reasons:
1. YU is &lt;b&gt;VERY&lt;/b&gt; expensive (from their website, about $45k all in).
2. The environment at YU is not considered wholesome enough (for example, unfiltered Internet access in libraries, etc).
3. For someone with no useful education at all, a lesser school may be more practical.
4. There exist more wholesome schools (Lander) that are less expensive to boot.
5. If they are willing to endure a less wholesome place, they may as well pick something like Queens College or Brooklyn College, both closer to home and less expensive (by a lot).
6. Going to YU is a sort of validation of what YU stands for.
7. Going to YU means learning at YU; In their community it is far more preferable to learn by their own people (after all, they still want to teach their own hashkafa, and their own Rabbeim also need the work) and go to college separately (at night exclusively, or with a few day classes mixed in).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps a subtle issue facing the community of Yisroel is how to include less intellectually passionate people and lower socioeconomic people in the the Community, tent or no tent.  At least, this is an issue in the US.  People who cannot afford to live in the affluent areas within walking distance of shuls, people who are not built for professional school, graduate school, or who are not fortunate to have a large income from an entrepreneurial enterprise.  People who do not want to live on charity and want to be respected for their hard and honest work, whatever it is, and have access to a welcoming rabbi who actually cares about and understands their lives and the lives or other &quot;common&quot; folk.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;President Joel is in contact with charedi leaders but he gets the sense that there is not much interest on their part. But he noted that there are fewer attacks against YU these days. I think that might have to do with the new charedi whipping boy YCT.&quot;


1. On perception from the right, I think many on the right have more issue with gender-mixing than the stuff he spoke of (quality of Torah study).


2. About YCT being the new whipping boy of the right, this seems undoubtedly true. One who reads the Yated&#039;s coverage of YCT can see that the Yated is almost building YU up a little bit as it tries ripping YCT down.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool your jets, man.


I have already addressed this several times. Perhaps this is the best formulation: http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/21/there-is-no-tent/


The idea is that our Torah leaders have ALWAYS been engaged in the outside world unless they were precluded from engagement by persecution.


Engaging in the world means making a living, understanding God&#039;s world through the lenses or science, history, and sociology, and using every opportunity to make a kiddush Hashem by example to the rest of the world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;President Joel expanded on this by explaining that Torah U’Mada can be a very sterile approach. The new approach is Shleimus, the complete person. The idea is that Torah is not supposed to be practiced in an Ir Miklat (city of refuge), it is supposed to be a launching pad. While Torah U’Mada is part of that philosophy, it became associated with certain apologetics. The modified approach is that Torah U’Mada is an aspiration, not one specific approach for those who can’t hack more insular versions of orthodoxy.&quot;


I find this particularly interesting; it may represent a reconceptualization of the MO hashkafic ideal to something very much akin to TIDE.  To me the notion that TuM is not a hashkafa in and of itself, but an approach to dealing with a particular set of issues (the relationship between Torah learning and practice and the methods and conclusions of Western academics), which is only a subset of a larger hashkafa.  Hashkafa is weltanshauug - a complete world view; TuM is not that, but properly considered is a valuable tool for answering questions that need to be dealt with by any true hashkafa/weltanshauug.  


I need to think on this, but I sense that the potential in rethinking the role of TuM in this way is really interesting and exciting, perhaps an important philosophical turn that reveals unarticulated but deeply sensed ways in which TuM fails to do what we think it should, and that allows us to think about TuM in a more limited way that allows us to use it to do what is can actually accomplish.]]></description>

The idea is that Torah is not supposed to be practiced in an Ir Miklat (city of refuge), it is supposed to be a launching pad. While Torah U’Mada is part of that philosophy, it became associated with certain apologetics. The modified approach is that Torah U’Mada is an aspiration, not one specific approach for those who can’t hack more insular versions of orthodoxy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I find this particularly interesting; it may represent a reconceptualization of the MO hashkafic ideal to something very much akin to TIDE.  To me the notion that TuM is not a hashkafa in and of itself, but an approach to dealing with a particular set of issues (the relationship between Torah learning and practice and the methods and conclusions of Western academics), which is only a subset of a larger hashkafa.  Hashkafa is weltanshauug &#8211; a complete world view; TuM is not that, but properly considered is a valuable tool for answering questions that need to be dealt with by any true hashkafa/weltanshauug.  </p>
