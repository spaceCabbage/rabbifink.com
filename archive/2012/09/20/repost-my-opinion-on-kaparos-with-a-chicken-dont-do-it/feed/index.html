		<description><![CDATA[If kaparos was just something nice to do when shechting your
yom tov chicken, then is there any point to doing it with money? It seems that
it went from a nice extra that some people took a moment to do while preparing
their yom tov meal, to something that was considered so essential that even if
you couldn’t get a hold  of a chicken,
you should at least do it with money.


 


Using money instead of a chicken is also reminiscent of substituting
money for the value of hekdish and giving the money to the Bais Hamikdash
instead of the animal/crops.


 


FYI, my (Yekke) family has never done kaparos. Although some
of my chasiddishe-inclined cousins have adopted the minhag, AFAIK, none of my
ancestors ever waved a chicken over their heads.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This image was taken this morning, where a few thousand chickens are &quot;resting&quot; after a long travel to Williamsburg Brooklyn where they will further be taken for distribution to be shaken up and be repacked in their crats for the return trip on Mon, of course the the only thing that goes into the mouth of the chickens are the feces of their upstairs neighbor chickens (imagine the chicken who lives on the level 1 crate)...... What a shame!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never done this in my life. 


I think a few times my father used a $20 for everyone, but at the dining-room table right before Kol Nidrei so the $20 just sat in a drawer until someone found it and just thought it was a lost $20. ]]></description>
