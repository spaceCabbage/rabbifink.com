		<description><![CDATA[Thank you  for posting this article. I actually took the time to look up several sources, especially the one from R Moshe Feinstein regarding forms of permitted contraception in extreme health situations. This article and R Moshe&#039;s teshuva empowers us to ask informed questions of Rabbis who they themselves may be unfamiliar with the source materials. In cases of significant physical danger as determined by the medical community, I don&#039;t believe that every detail needs to be shared with a Rabbi in order to make an informed decision. The rabbi think he understands the Halacha, but may not fully appreciate the dangers associated with the various alternative forms of contraception. This article serves as a great source to discuss with reasonable rabbis and a better source for making personal decisions if we believe that the rabbis available to us are not open minded enough to be persuaded even by a clear determination by the giant of 20th century psak.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It looks like all of the comments on this post were made 9 months back in the immediate aftermath of the posting. I am sorry to &quot;reopen the wounds&quot; (and make trouble) 9 months late but I only saw this post now.

I think the analysis by Rabbis Mayer and Messner is superb but nevertheless, I think it is a bit incomplete. 

Rabbis M and M focus on two Halachic issues with contraception: zera l&#039;vatala and delay of pru u&#039;rvu. Thus they conclude that since more modern methods of contraception may eliminate both of these concerns, it merely boils down to a matter of hashkafa.

I think otherwise. Modern methods of contraception (pill and IUD) while circumventing these two halachic issues, open up two new ones that were not present in the case of the moch (diaphram) or condom (simple barrier methods).

These two issues (though they may be viewed as one broad issue) are: the prohibition to alter or tamper with one&#039;s body (such as tattoos or &quot;hachovel b&#039;atzmo&quot;) and, more starkly, the prohibition of making sterile any creature - and certainly a human and oneself (&quot;b&#039;artzecha lo taasu&quot;). 

For the latter issue, the question would be: is a reversible sterilization as is caused by these two methods - or, certainly, by the pill -  also prohibited as much as a permanent one? Not to mention that these methods carry slight but tangible risks of becoming irreversible (R&quot;L).

It is no surprise that the rishonim or early achronim do not deal with these issues because they only apply to modern techniques. It is a bit surprising, however, that modern poskim do not focus on them. 

Regardless, although I am not a posek, I do feel that today&#039;s modern methods of contraception do indeed entail serious Halachic concerns.]]></description>

As a math person, I figured it would be a good idea to mention that there is a typo on page 42 (since the article has not been published yet) &quot;that time limitations increase geometrically&quot;, they probably meant that &quot;time limitations increase exponentially&quot;.  
Much hatzlacha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Possibly it is because I am an &quot;older&quot; father, but still in the parasha, my attitude and experience are different from one who is done with family rearing years and from one starting out.  When I got married, and started learning in kollel, both my wife and her friends as well as I and my friends thought that every month that someone didn&#039;t become pregnant, maybe they had some sort of medical issue!  We had intended to have close to a dozen kids.  And my rabbi&#039;s wife was disappointed at one of her sons&#039; bar mitzvah that her room mate from the last pregnancy had 2 children since, and she only had 1 (they had 9 at the time).  I frankly don&#039;t understand why someone who ostensibly was haredi would want to not have a large family!  Yes, it is well established that the ikar mitzvah is, according to Beit Hillel, 1 boy and 1 girl, and according to Beit Shammai is 2 boys.  More than that is hidur.  That is what being an observant Jew is about, keeping hidur mitzvot!  We say birkat hamazon after eating only a kazayit of bread, instead of only after satiation.  Most families light a number of Shabbat candles according to the amount of people in the family, when 1 would suffice for the mitzvah.  Virtually nobody lights one Hannuka candle each nioght, which is all the mitzvah requires.  And most people try to buy a hadar &quot;peri eitz hadar&quot;!  So why should having a large family be different?


If you go into marriage with this attitude, and if you are haredi, I couldn&#039;t see why you wouldn&#039;t, you probably would be on your fourth of five child before you realized that maybe you weren&#039;t cut out for it.  That did happen to us, as the older children showed problems with autism, and we felt that not having as many kids as we originally intended may have been a better avenue.  For us, there was no question of asking a rabbi.  After our last child, 5th by ceasearian, the dcotor and circumstances made it clear that more was no longer an option.  Yet we both feel a slight naughty expectation when something is missed, that maybe there is more in store!  But we both thank G_d for my wife&#039;s health when it turns out to be a false alarm!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s say that someone doesn&#039;t want to do the mitzva of tzedaka. Would we say he is really not giving wholeheartedly and his tzedaka is worthless? 

According to what your saying, people could free themselves from the obligations to do mitzvos because they didn&#039;t feel right about them. If one doesn&#039;t feel right about it, then they should study and improve themselves so they do feel right.

As for those children that would be in for an unhappy life, even though Hashem does everything for the good in the way that we understand, sometimes it is good for a neshama to come into an unfavorable situation either due to gilgulim or to serve Hashem in a unique way by overcoming difficulty.

If a person doesn&#039;t want children because it gets in the way of their pleasures and it reaches the point that they would be a horrible parent because of that, they could find permission not to have children. However, there is no question that they will be punished for being such materialistic pleasure seekers. 

If they have mental problems, let them seek help from mental health professionals. Otherwise, the normal thing is to desire children and to have them. If one has abnormal needs, they have to seek the root of them and treat them appropriately.]]></description>

There is no such thing (i.e. there are no &quot;wrong&quot; reasons). Those who don&#039;t want a child will not be as good a parent as those who want a child. And I fully support anyone who doesn&#039;t want a child to NOT bring an unwanted child into this world. And my best guess is that HKB&quot;H supports that as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The gemora just says that Moshiach won&#039;t come until all the children that should be born are born. The Chofetz Chaim adds that one who doesn&#039;t have the number of children that he should is holding back Moshiach

&quot;4-When people don&#039;t fulfill the ideals in the Torah it may be proper to call it tragic, but what may seem like a tragedy to you may in fact be a blessing for others.&quot;

We are in this world temporarily and our goal is to gain as much as we can for the world to come while trying to maintain happiness in this world. If people make a trade off for temporary pleasure which denies them the true pleasure of the children they should have and which denies klal Yisroel of those children, that&#039;s a tragedy.


&quot;5-A posek who considers strains on the family and emotional stability to be strong reasons to consider contraception, would be someone who can help sort out the issues, and can help you arrive at a proper decision. I wish that all poskim are in this category, but there may be many who aren&#039;t.&quot;

So then what? Roll your own?

If one had a cancer and wasn&#039;t happy with a particular doctor, would they then roll their own? The stakes are too high for that and it&#039;s likely that the doctor with his training can make a better choice.

I don&#039;t understand why we don&#039;t on a general basis afford qualified Rabbonim the respect of their training and self perfection even if some are not worthy of it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a member of the MO community; I found this very interesting for the following:  My impression could be wrong, but cannot imagine anyone in our neighborhood &quot;seeking permission&quot; from a Rav to stop having children.  There is just not that kind of mindset of respect or deference to a Rav in the MO world, as far as I can see.  The more frum might ask about the most-halachicaly acceptable forms of birth control, but not about the decision itself.   (Once again, of course, no way for me to really know if my impression is right.)  
But it sounds to me like its part of a larger issue of difference, in terms of a different way of viewing halacha entirely, perhaps.  It sounds as if, to the Right Wing, the Rav giving a heter actually changes how the halacha applies to you.  So that there is value in the Rav&#039;s pask even if you have to bend the truth to get it.  I think the MO (or maybe its just me) would view halacha as an objective rule, and a Rav can only interpret for you how it applies, based on the facts.  If you give him the wrong facts, the psak would not have any value whatsoever.    But I am if  others think I am characterizing the RIght Wing view correctly.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Chofetz Chaim z&quot;l said that people are holding back the advent of Moshiach. How are they doing this? They are refusing to have children that they should have had and it says d&#039;ain ben Dovid boh ad sheyichle kol haneshamos shebiguf.

The ideal of Judaism is to have as many children as you can. This does not mean that there should not be considerations of strain on the family of a physical or emotional nature. However, considerations of an easy retirement, more freedom to engage in pleasantries doesn&#039;t cut it. One may not be violating any prohibitions by engaging in unnecessary contraception but they are certainly not fulfilling the ideals of the Torah. There are tragic consequences for the Jewish people and for the individual.

That is why those seeking a heiter should speak to a competent Posek.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not sure what a Rav would or should say. There are people who get this mitzvah right away, others that it takes many years, and others that need to takes breaks and then will be able to have 1 of each gender after attempting again.  There are also those who will attempt, but not ever acheive this mitzvah despite trying.  That doesn&#039;t mean that a family should jeopardize the stability of their home to do something that is beyond what they are able to do.  As an example, Jews living in Russia didn&#039;t walk to Italy before each Sukkos to get an esrog despite the fact that they knew that they wouldn&#039;t get that mitzvah that year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I agree that we shouldn&#039;t blindly follow whatever a rabbi tells us, there are a few problems with doing it your way. One concern I have, is that if you were to learn halacha on your own, in many (if not most) cases you would have to be stricter than if you asked a good rabbi. To avoid such a problem, you&#039;d have to be more learned than the vast majority of rabbanim today and you&#039;d have to have learned from/with one of the smaller number of rabbanim that know enough to be more lenient. My opinion is, that it would be better to learn on your own enough so you can tell if your rabbi knows his stuff and if not, find a new one! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The yeshivish community is a big tent and includes many &quot;new

The women with the really expensive sheitels may or may not want to show
 more hair, but some of them want to wear a style that involves combing 
their hair back so it looks like a natural hairline sometimes, or not to
 wear a snood or hat that makes their head look like it is stuffed into a
 sock, or some alternative if they are hot and don&#039;t want each hair on 
their head covered. There are plenty of people like that. Rabbi Miller 
could attack teshuvos by Conservative rabbis all day if he wanted to, 
but why would he? No, he attacked a widely available article in 
Tradition, written by an Orthodox rabbi and dayan, and brimming with 
sources. Such an article, not an RA teshuva, really can change the way 
people act, and I bet it has, and same thing with contraception which is
 way more important to people. I could be wrong, but I bet the reason

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed that not all rabbis are created equal.  But why would one ever go to a rabbi that&#039;s not trained/seasoned/wise in the areas for which you seek guidance? 
If you assume the halachik issues are yes/no (ie once I find my heter or understand the sources to be matir my chosen behavior) then you are right, but I would argue that this issue is not that clear cut and is a matter of balancing competing values, some of which are halachik, some are religious (haskafik) and some are just good ole human values.  Even after studying sources, etc it can be pretty difficult to decide on one&#039;s own (without the context  that is second nature to any expert) how solve that equation.  It would seem absurd to blindly follow that rabbi (although, we both know that happens all too often), but to ignore his experience (in how others have balanced similar values/considerations) and decide these things on one&#039;s own would seem pretty arrogant.
Regarding the financial advice...I would not (and did not) suggest going to a rabbi for advice about finances.  However, a good rabbi will have dealt with congregants who have gone through similar experiences as you and give you insight into how they dealt with those issues.  Whether the rabbi will be helpful, one never knows...but to assume that a 21 year old will have the necessary perspective on their own, without looking for guidance just seems unrealistic.  Sure, ask parents, etc - just realize that parents have biases (just like rabbis).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you misunderstood me and the footnote. Let me explain. I and the Rav actually completely agree with you.  He told me that having children is mitzvah and should be continued unless it runs into problems such as those you describe.  He said that in the 1940&#039;s and 1950&#039;s couple were maxed out after 2 or 3 children.  Starting the 70&#039;s the family size grew as Jewish families succeded with 4-6 children and then even more than that.  Recently he observed that the family size may start to shrink as complications and stress are forcing people to rethink the issue of family size.  He actually told me that he viewed his job as being an advocate for a healthy and non stressed family, and was merely observing that in his lifetime the point of danger to a family was reached at different points.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In addition to the couple and the rabbi, there are other parties who are affected in a non-financial way by the decision of whether to have more kids:  the as-yet unconceived child and the existing children of the couple. 

The impact on the older children can often be determined with a fair degree of accuracy, so it would be wrong not to take their well-being into account.  (Note that the impact can be either positive or negative, but hardly ever neutral).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@611b38e19f856b2b8ebf0e73b38ad8cd:disqus &lt;i&gt;On the other hand, if you are 21 yrs old and have never been married with children before, it seems almost presumptive of you to guess how your mind, body, finances will react to having a child. A rav may be helpful here, not just as a posaik, but as a manhig. &lt;/i&gt;



I think it&#039;s also presumptive (even more so) to assume that a Rabbi would be more helpful. Much better would be a parent, an older friend, a psychologist, or a &quot;life coach&quot; (ha!). Few Rabbanim are well-trained in these areas, so their opinion is not necessarily worth very much. And sometimes, depending on their worldview, their opinions can be very harmful with bad effects that last lifetimes.


I&#039;m particularly laughing at the suggestion of getting financial advice from a rav, especially the kind that is completely supported by the community even to the extent of having his kids school tuition paid by the community. Hey, when you don&#039;t pay tuition, you can afford to have as many kids as you want (assuming you can handle them emotionally). And, advice from someone who has zero experience working out in the real world (outside the yeshiva, shul, and communal organizations) to actually &lt;i&gt;earn&lt;/i&gt; money rather than just shift it around within the community is also nearly worthless.


People should ask questions of people based on their experience and knowledge. So you ask the Rabbi about halacha - is the chicken kosher? Am I still niddah? How do I heat on shabbos? How do setup a partnership in an halachic manner? That kind of stuff. And you try to find Rabbanim with expertise in the subject matter, not just random Rabbanim.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that you are asking an excellent and important question.  The navigation of how to resolve this issue requires us to break your question into 3 parts; the mitzvah of pru urvu, contraception, and other considerations.  
1- Pru urvu is a mitzvah that requires us to strive to have one son and one daughter.  Not everyone merits the fulfillment of every mitzvah, but must give it his best shot. There are many instances in life where we try our best to do what is right, but we don&#039;t always succeed.
2- Contraception : Just because a person tried to fulfill pru urvu but didn&#039;t succeed doesn&#039;t mean that he is guilty of &#039;shichvas zera livatala&#039;.  These are 2 separate issues.   
3- There may be situations that setting your sights on the fulfillment of one mitzvah may lead to compromising many other obligations of the Torah.  At the end of the article we list many life situations which must be considered before putting yourself into a precarious situation.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I came home one night after being married for 3 weeks to find that my wife had started birth control that day, without discussing it with me, based on &quot;Daas Toirah&quot; as per the shalom bayis loophole noted above. Since then I am married a total of 2 and 1/2 years (@ least by July 4th it will be), and am very happily married. My house is an open house to my single friends, and they and all my single relatives, want to find someone &quot;like my wife&quot;. I take that as outside confirmation of the rock solidness of our relationship. Just yesterday me and my wife had a fight, and as I typically do when a fight gets serious enough, I printed out a document for her to sign, making sure that she owns my 120g portfolio tax free if I die, (my way of upping the commitment during a fighting period, periods being fights that last &#062; a week).
Anyways, I am 24, she is 25, she is in school for her 3rd degree, and works full time, and I work the odd job but mostly study for acceptence to Columbia (it takes a lot of studying, as being a Lakewood &quot;illuy&quot; I was learning full time starting 7th grade, so when I started I was not preparing for the SAT&#039;s, I was learning fractions).
I see a lot of potential in me, and tons of potential in my wife. I know that having a pregnancy before 30 would be extremely hazardous to both of our professional developments.
I have stood my ground against extreme pressure (parents, friends, RABBONIM, Gedolim you name it), and more a less a year after a came out with my decision (you know telling the world they can stop davening for me, &#038; letting them draw they&#039;re own conclusion), there has been a marked turnaround. The people around me, started viewing me as though-out instead of freiy ,&#038; I feel like I am truly respected for my decision. 
As you can see, I am not at all secretive about it, because I feel if people gossip about my story, (and they do, it&#039;s juicy,how can you blame them?), then a lot of people can hear about an alternative. And that&#039;s a good thing. 
                                           -Hu&#039;ainoy Roitzeh, B&#039;illum Shemoi, Umuchrach Lechain!
P.S. The details are all real, if you figure out my name, feel free to schmooze about me in the coffee room. The internet being as lasting as it is PLEASE do not right my name, (@ 30, I&#039;ll have kids to get into school, lol!).]]></description>

Very complete analysis, and interesting read. Thank you for
posting.



However  do I get it wrong understanding that basically if someone has 1
girl and  boy it&#039;s more or less ok to call it quits according to the article,
but say if someone has 9 daughters they is no halachic (barring medical issues)
availability to have recourse to co contraception?
