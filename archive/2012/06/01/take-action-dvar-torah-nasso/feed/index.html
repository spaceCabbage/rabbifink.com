		<description><![CDATA[This supports the general approach that the Tanach takes that big flashy experiences have little long time effect.  40 days after Mt Sinai the Jews were building the Golden Calf.  One day after Eliyahu inspires the Jewish crowd to kill 400 priests of Baal he is fleeing for his life with no one to defend him.  The 2nd revelation on Mt Sinai (to Eliyahu) shows him that you don&#039;t find Hashem in the fire, or the earthquake, or the mighty gust of wind, but in the &#039;still small voice&#039; (or as Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks translates it &#039;a sound of thin silence&#039;).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Torah provides a miraculous method....and cause her body to violently explode in a horrible
 death.&quot;

Normally I am not surprised to see rabbi&#039;s give over an embellished reading of the text as if it were written there plainly without qualification.   However, I am surprised, and not quite sure why, that you presented it as being very dramatic or as some might say fantastical.   Why does making her belly swell necessarily mean violently explode?   Perhaps it didn&#039;t explode, and she just lost her uterus without dieing.  (i.e. the opposite of being bless with a child and being deprived of any further children).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another possible explanation. The sota is a woman, always a woman. So all the women that witness the event will be &quot;scared straight&quot; and will avoid adultery as much as possible. But the men, on the other hand, aren&#039;t as affected by it. After all, &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; will never be forced to drink the potion and die a horrible death. No add that it is men who tend to drink, and to get drunk, and to behave badly under the influence, and the juxtaposition now makes perfect sense ... for the men - don&#039;t drink lest you behave badly under the influence.


Shabbat Shalom Umevorach to all.]]></description>
