		<description><![CDATA[Disclaimer? What do you call this?!

What follows is &lt;b&gt;not a discussion of the practical halacha.&lt;/b&gt; Rather, this is an exploration of the sources in the writings of the Rambam.

In a responsa, R’ Moshe Feinstein clearly holds that one is permitted to take money to study in Kollel, *even* according to the Rambam. See the Responsa here: Igros Moshe. Indeed, the Kesef Mishnah largely dismisses the sources for Maimonides’ position and simply states that no one really goes with this Rambam.

&lt;b&gt;So it is clear, this is not a referendum on Kollel. This is simply an academic exercise to determine precisely what Maimonides meant in two seemingly conflicting passages.&lt;/b&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Are you suggesting that your post was not connected to anything practical, that the current state of affairs in the charedi community is not the reason why this is a topic of discussion, and that nothing written here has any bearing on halocho lema&#039;aseh? This is a strictly academic discussion and of course the Kollel system is the correct one, and following the anti-kollel system is a da&#039;as yochid.

		<description><![CDATA[Why is the Rambam the only opinion counted? The Rema in Shulchan Aruch is machria against the Rambam. Halocho has been decided by that Rema, the Mishna Berura and many years of tradition. I know many will say it is a new phenomena, but the truth is the only difference between today and the old days is the polarization of the issue. On the one hand, some people are fully dedicated to learning Torah, and on the other hand, some people are publicly marrying shiksas. The in between is also more polarized. Before the enlightenment, the best sat and learnt and the worst only said tehillim, except the extremley rare avaryan. We do not have more full-time learners today that 400 years ago. We just have more irreligious people who have been excluded from the pool.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting article.  I learned in shiur tonight a &quot;modern&quot; opposing opinion to Rambam from R&#039; Shimon Shkopp in his introduction to Shaar Yosher it would appear that full time learning is the only path.  As to how one will survive he writes that just as God made Moshe wealthy from the clippings of the new luchos so to God will provide.  R&#039; Shimon also writes that the only source of true knowledge is Torah.  More fascinating is the fact that he agreed to become Rosh Yeshiva of YU shortly after he published his sefer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reread, looks fine. Your piece is a thinly veiled hit on Lakewood and you call me judgmental?


My point is simple. You choose to base your outlook on life on the parts of the Rambam that are convenient for you while not attempting to take a more holistic approach. The Rambam requires people to work (for argument&#039;s sake); he also requires tremendous avodas hashem among many other things. What I see is an attitude that embraces the former while kvetching how hard the latter is, but &quot;we&#039;re just human, so what are you gonna do?&quot;


Therefore in Lakewood, they do it the opposite. They focus on the OTHER Rambam&#039;s and do their best to meet those requirements. As for this Rambam, &quot;nu, what are you going to do, we&#039;re just human&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The fact that Rambam compares the two in the Peirush does not help me. When he mentions the actual halacha, he says that anyone who joins shevet Levi, Hashem will provide for him &quot;just like for shevet Levi.&quot; this. Implies he can be sustained by public funds just like the leviim.  If Rambam meant that he can only benefit by getting pro-bono money managing and pre-market consumers, he should have said so. Saying &quot;like shevet Levi,&quot; implies exactly the same way. The Peirush is not a commentary in the mishna Torah, and, in my opinion, should not be used so here, as the Peirush is so incongruous with the plain meaning if the halacha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is, yes (a specific article on the amount in the budget from the fall of 2010) http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=192771 and an article implying the government still provides money for stipends from just a few days ago (http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/ex-pmo-chief-gov-t-must-focus-on-getting-haredim-jobs-not-army-stints.premium-1.434881)


I&#039;m actually a little bit surprised you weren&#039;t aware of this; where do you think American communities got the idea for large-scale indefinite kollel? Certainly not from pre-war Europe where only the absolute absolute absolute top students did learning-only for any time at all post-marriage (rather than learning but also teaching or serving as a community rabbi) and even they only did it for a couple of years and then went to work.

		<description><![CDATA[One caveat to this part. 

In closing, I think Maimonides was in fact speaking to a specific set of
 circumstances when he unequivocally banned Torah scholars from using 
their Torah knowledge to earn a living. It seems it was an involuntary 
system that he most abhorred as well. Today, most people supporting 
others in learning and rabbis or teachers taking salaries for Torah 
related jobs are under very different circumstances whether it is the 
giver or the taker.

The &quot;involuntary system&quot; is essentially what exists in the state of Israel right now, though, i.e. tax dollars go directly towards kollel stipends, don&#039;t they?]]></description>

Ha! not likely. Mostly the givers and the takers are not doing it out of their own will. The takers take because its the system they are in and the givers give because they have to and it makes them look good in their communities. &lt;/b&gt;]]></description>
