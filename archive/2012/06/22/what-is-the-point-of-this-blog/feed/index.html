		<description><![CDATA[I am someone who has severely criticized you here in the comments in the past when I thought you totally violated halachos of lashon hara and more and went very overboard in your zeal. 


You admit here you made mistakes. That is refreshing to hear. 
Reading your post, I bet if we met and got to know each other we would pretty much have the same hashkafos and totally get along. I also think the charedim are sometimes way too closed minded and I am charedi.. I just think that in the past you crossed way too many lines which lacked kavod chachamim. Ask, ask, and ask some more. I do all the time on gedolim and rabbanim. Just think 17 times before blowing them off, and with chutzpah, esp. in public. Usually,999 out of 1000 it will be wrong to write in public against gedolim and rabbanim.
Good luck on the bar! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The criticism from the charedi side is more significant and has a greater impact on my reputation and career.&quot;  This offhand remark is one of the most honest, important statements I have read in a while.  I would suggest that Modern Orthodoxy is losing its way -- and losing a number of its most dedicated followers -- because it is being held hostage by the Orthodox right.   
It reminds me of a terrific speech by a very well known Modern Orthodox rabbi about women&#039;s role in tefillah.... His final conclusion was &quot;Yes, many of these things are permissible and may well be beneficial over time, but does it need to start under my watch??&quot;
I cannot speak for others, but when I read or hear comments like these, my stomach turns.  For the sake of &quot;Unity&quot; our community is missing opportunities.  And who are these people who are holding our Rabbinate hostage?  One only has to pick up any newspaper to see that their own houses are not in order as measured against any moral guidepost.  
In short, Modern Orthodoxy is suffering badly from a leadership shortage caused -- at least in part -- by fear of charedi strong-arming.  And we will lose many people as a result.
Kol Hakavod for speaking up honestly and respectfully.  We need a lot more voices!

How seriously can I take a comment that is so clearly factually inaccurate.


And where&#039;s your sense of humor? A little joke about Rav Schorr breaking Twitter is funny. Hardly disrespectful. Please. Lighten up and get a grip.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Rabbi Fink. 


I wanted to say that I really appreciate your blog as well.  I appreciate your tone.  I appreciate the exact point that you made above: that this is an Orthodox blog that is both respectful of Rabbis as well as respectfully challenging too.
I have been reading the Jewish blogs for several years now, but yours is the first one that my wife has starting reading on her own as well - please take that as a huge compliment.
Please G-d I will make it to your shul in California one day.


Thank you again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this article seems to be a response to critisism from someone that you are scared of or in a position of power over you. the articles you write ALWAYS have a negative tone and always leads to comments from people that write the most negative and simply mean things against jews from all sects of judaism. i dont think you give a fair shot to the other side of your argument and you write things that you know to be misleading and many times against halacha and not consistent with the person you quote. its always along the lines of &quot;look at the dumb thing that some rwoj person said or did and let me show you how wrong they are&quot; you never write just a positive article without any negative connatations its always negative and sometimes some positivty just to help you with your goal of getting people to trust everything you said. i think that just the comments written are enough of a reason not to have a blog they are almost always lashon hora. your facebook status about rav schorr says it all. i know that you dont like to admit that this is true but exposing dirty laundry always in every case is a bad thing. we all know that bad and immoral things happen in the frum community but its certainly not worse than in any other community and definetly doesnt outweigh the amazing good.
