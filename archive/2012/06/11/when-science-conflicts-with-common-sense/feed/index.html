		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s easy to understand why we have a bias for sensory based knowledge.  If you see a lion, your first instinct is to run, not to wonder what a lion might be doing in the liquor cabinet.  I think this accounts for the initial discomfort in accepting the heliocentric model; it violates the understandable evolutionary link between seeing and believing (were it otherwise, practitioners of sleight-of-hand would be unable to find employment). 


Interestingly,  I think common sense has more in common with empiricism then  rationalism which is why, for example, Eric Hoffer makes considerably more sense then Einstein on any subject other then science.  
It&#039;s also why I&#039;m not bothered by the vaguely  anti-religious bias of the New Yorker article.  What if people who believe in a young earth theory give more charity and have more intact families? What if virtue depended on the acceptance of certain myths; wouldn&#039;t the more appropriate question be whether some myths are better then others and not whether myths are an obstacle to human advancement?
You seem to imply that mysticism is an impediment to moral progress.  Extreme rationalism may have failed in Judaism not because of religious primitiveness or a recalcitrant folk culture but because without the restraining force of mysticism (the belief that the intellect is an inferior mechanism for experiencing the transcendent) rationalism will inevitably give way to naturalism.
Finally, I am uncertain about the nature of the appeal you make to education.  Given the bizarre notions that emerge daily from academia (political correctness, the belief that America is a racist county and moral relativism, will do for starters), I&#039;m sure you mean to advocate something other then increased college enrollment.  Please explain.

		<description><![CDATA[Re: There is no evidence the Talmud believed the Earth was flat.  


Then why are there halachos that depend on the premise that it is?  


Re: I believe we could presume...


Why?  Religious people today also don&#039;t agree with &quot;the common scientific view of their time.&quot;


Re: At most you can argue that they believed the Earth was a hemisphere.


You&#039;re joking, right? When we discuss a flat Earth we mean the bottom.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I still don&#039;t understand how you reconcilie - you end up in a philosophical place that to me seems very weak: God becomes very limited in a Maimonidean world, and even more so in a post-enlightenment, post-postmodernism type world.  There are tons of questions about ethics, truth of the torah, and why do anything when you try to reconcile.

		<description><![CDATA[HI, Ezra,
Well, here goes.  First, the Rebbe is confusing the &quot;relativity principle&quot; -- that motion can only be defined with respect to some frame of reference.  E.g., you&#039;re riding on a train and see a train on the next track moving backward at 10 mph.  That&#039;s its speed relative to your train, but relative to the earth&#039;s surface (the frame of reference we take for granted), your train might be going 50 mph and the other train 40 mph in the same direction, or 30 and 20, or whatever.  The Rebbe is confusing this &quot;principle of relativity,&quot; described by Galileo in the early 17th century (and probably known much earlier) with Einstein&#039;s Special Theory of Relativity first published in 1905 which I won&#039;t try to explain here.  While the &quot;principle of relativity&quot; corresponds to &quot;common sense,&quot; the effects of Einstein&#039;s theory don&#039;t.  The Rebbe obviously never read or tried to understand Einstein, and is repeating someone&#039;s description of the principle of relativity, thinking they are the same thing.

Second, the rising and setting of the sun.  The daily motion of the sun we explain as the effect of the earth rotating on its axis every 24 hours.  If there was any doubt of this, careful measurements of the orbits of artificial satellites show that the earth is not a perfect sphere, but bulges slightly at the equator, an effect of the centrifugal force caused by the earth&#039;s rotation.  

Third, the seasons and the earth&#039;s orbit.  As the seasons change, the apparent path of the sun changes.  In the Northern Hemisphere, It is highest in the sky (furthest north) at midsummer, about  June 22, and lowest (furthest south) at midwinter, about December 22.  The ancients explained this by saying that the path of the sun around the earth was a composite of two separate circular motions, the daily motion circling the earth in 24 hours combined with a slower, one-year cycle in the opposite direction along a circle inclined at an angle of (IIRC) about 23 degrees to the Earth&#039;s equator called the &quot;ecliptic.&quot;  Twelve constellations along the ecliptic, the annual (not daily) apparent path of the sun around the earth gave their names to the twelve equal divisions of the circle -- the zodiac.  (The actual constellations are no longer in the same &quot;place&quot; and no longer correspond to the solar year.)

We explain the seasons in modern times as a consequence of the earth&#039;s yearly orbit around the sun and the angle between the earth&#039;s axis and the plane of the earth&#039;s orbit.  Because the earth&#039;s axis is &quot;tilted&quot; relative to the plane of the earth&#039;s orbit (at about 23 degrees), it &quot;points&quot; in a fixed direction, but as the earth moves around its orbit the axis points toward the sun on one side and away from the sun on the other.  Imagine walking around a building with your hand pointing north all the time -- on one side, you&#039;re pointing at the building, on the other side you&#039;re pointing away from it.  The north pole of the earth&#039;s axis points most nearly toward the sun at midsummer and most nearly away from it at midwinter (in the Northern Hemisphere).  Of course, that&#039;s how we define the seasons, from the apparent north-south movement of the sun.

That the earth orbits the sun and not vice-versa is confirmed by &quot;parallax.&quot;  [See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax#Stellar_parallax]  Although the size of the earth&#039;s orbit is very small compared to the distance to the nearest stars, it is not negligible.  The angle measured between a pair of stars, when one of them is close to the earth, will differ slightly when measured from one point on the earth&#039;s orbit and then measured again six months later from the opposite side.  This would not occur if the earth stood still and the sun moved around it.  The Rebbe is simply wrong that we have no way of knowing which revolves around which, and the effect of parallax was known well before the Rebbe was born.

I hope now you understand why I was appalled.  You were right to ask for an explanation when you didn&#039;t understand.  If only the Rebbe had.  KT, Kevin]]></description>

Because the earth&#8217;s axis is &#8220;tilted&#8221; relative to the plane of the earth&#8217;s orbit (at about 23 degrees), it &#8220;points&#8221; in a fixed direction, but as the earth moves around its orbit the axis points toward the sun on one side and away from the sun on the other.  Imagine walking around a building with your hand pointing north all the time &#8212; on one side, you&#8217;re pointing at the building, on the other side you&#8217;re pointing away from it.  The north pole of the earth&#8217;s axis points most nearly toward the sun at midsummer and most nearly away from it at midwinter (in the Northern Hemisphere).  Of course, that&#8217;s how we define the seasons, from the apparent north-south movement of the sun.</p>
<p>That the earth orbits the sun and not vice-versa is confirmed by &#8220;parallax.&#8221;  [See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax#Stellar_parallax" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax#Stellar_parallax</a>  Although the size of the earth&#8217;s orbit is very small compared to the distance to the nearest stars, it is not negligible.  The angle measured between a pair of stars, when one of them is close to the earth, will differ slightly when measured from one point on the earth&#8217;s orbit and then measured again six months later from the opposite side.  This would not occur if the earth stood still and the sun moved around it.  The Rebbe is simply wrong that we have no way of knowing which revolves around which, and the effect of parallax was known well before the Rebbe was born.</p>
<p>I hope now you understand why I was appalled.  You were right to ask for an explanation when you didn&#8217;t understand.  If only the Rebbe had.  KT, Kevin</p>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;It&#039;s SCIENCE.



Not sure what you are implying by making that all in caps...but alrighty....

I just did. The article spends a lot of time dealing with how certain ideas go against our common sense. Ok. Great. But my question still stands. The article commenced with religious people, and then failed to return why THEY don&#039;t believe in it. It&#039;s not because it goes against THEIR intuition. It&#039;s because THEY have already been pre-educated to think a different way. It&#039;s like the article says: People aren&#039;t blank slates. Then how can you be sure if something is going against their intuition/common sense thinking vs. religious indoctrination? Both, form methods of thinking about the world in a certain way. If so, then how can your solution of education against common sense be valid, since in THIS particular case of religious rejection of evolution, doesn&#039;t come from common sense, but, ironically....from education. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll take a crack at the argument you linked since I hear it all the time and IT DRIVES ME ABSOLUTELY NUTS.  I hope that I don&#039;t sound stupid: It&#039;s been 14 years since AP physics.


So, firstly, when we discuss the scientific claim that the earth revolves around the sun in contrast to what appears to be true from the perspective of our eyes--that is, the sun revolving around the earth--we, in fact, are discussing neither.  What is causing the sun to appear that it is moving is the earth rotating on it&#039;s own axis.  No one disputes this, even geo-centrists.  


If we used the theory of relativity exclusively and without other scientific findings, as was done in the link you posted, someone could just as well apply it in this instance.  Someone could say, &quot;We don&#039;t know that the earth turns on its axis.  Maybe every day the sun completes an entire orbit around the earth?  Maybe that&#039;s how we get days and it slightly changes it&#039;s orbit to give us seasons.&quot;  No reasonable person would believe this, even though it&#039;s theoretically possible, because of all the other scientific laws and findings that come into play that do not negate the theory of relativity and are not mutually exclusive.


Similarly in the argument you brought up, if the theory of relativity was the only scientific finding then yes, the evidence would be 50/50.  But it&#039;s not.  This argument is just grasping at straws.


Now, once upon a time Chazal thought that the earth was flat and that the sun entered the earth&#039;s atmosphere every day, etc.  This is in fact where we got the notion of shkiya.  We have all accepted that this was a misunderstanding (I hope), since the evidence is overwhelming enough and has been for long enough.  Maybe with regards to geocentrism and heliocentrism this will eventually be the case as well. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read the New Yorker article. ( I doubt they have the final answer on this issue, but OK). Anyways, how am I to understand that these 46% have a hard time due common sense? I mean, it&#039;s religion that is most likely causing them not to believe in evolution. If not for religion, they would have no problem believing in it. Meaning, since we don&#039;t know what the default setting of the brain is, I would say they ARE using the &quot;the tool&quot; of education to program themselves. It&#039;s called religion. The brain on an objective level doesn&#039;t know what is right or wrong. It&#039;s simply how we program it. So for them, they are programed right, it&#039;s not about common sense. They&#039;ve already been educated. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not kidding myself. I&#039;ve kinda given up on finding meaningful answers, or even discussions.
The irony is that over the past few weeks in the fallout of the great Asifa, when I would ask chareidi rabbonim why, instead of simply bashing the internet, they&#039;re not online forwarding their worldview through blogs, their answer has been &quot;there&#039;s plenty of Torah online, there&#039;s Aish&quot;
I ask them, &quot;since when have you relied on Aish to promote your torah&quot;?
