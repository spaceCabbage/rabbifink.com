		<description><![CDATA[I much agree with your post except for the last part about being role model. We don&#039;t own our favorite celebs, but celebs should know that being a role model is part of the &#039;job&#039; and responsibility. If they exploit that role model status to sell clothes, running shoes, etc. 


The facts show that many nobodies turned celebrities can&#039;t handle that responsibility. I think we were hoping that his strong Jewish background and advisers would be strong enough to sustain the pressure of being in a secular (and hedonistic) industry, so we are disappointed and frustrated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yasher koach Rabbi for writing this! I read Mr. Nehorai&#039;s piece on the Huffington Post, and all I could do is cringe. It is unfair to both sides whenever anyone puts another human being on a pedestal. But then again, we have Orthodox Jews who are so caught up in the gedolim fetish...so maybe I&#039;m talking to the wall here. But anyway, the bottom line should be that the utmost attention should be paid to your own personal relationship with G-d. Before you sit back and even think (much less write) to criticize others observances, look at yourself and pick out something that you can improve upon. All of us have something...so let&#039;s not throw stones here. As for Matisyahu, I also feel very bad that his spiritual growth and development has to be scrutinized and criticized in such a public way.


Apparently, we don&#039;t seem to learn so much from our past. In many ways I see the parallel between Matisyahu and Malcolm X. While the former is an entertainer and the later was an activist, when Malcolm X was alive for most of his public life he was a puppet for Elijah Muhammad. And that puppet stood for racism, intimidation and fiery rhetoric. However the undercurrent (which we know very clearly now) is that Malcolm X had his doubts about the Nation of Islam and in the end, he started to change his views and he tried to move out in a different direction. However NOI wasn&#039;t too happy about that; and when he was killed, they declined to make any public remorse over his death.


Our similarities bind us together more than our differences tear us apart!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Proof how fame and fortune can corrupt anyone. His beard didnt make him great his talent did, but his beard was a symbol. A symbol at least to me that, no matter how famous he got he would still be Matisyahu. I don&#039;t know if I even make sense, all I know is that picture with Wiz makes me sick. Wiz thinks life is a party Matis treated life like a journey I guess its just a journey till you get to the party. RIP Matisyahu]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s a fourth possible reason: 4) Before he shaved his beard, people thought they &quot;knew&quot; Matisyahu.   After he shaved his beard they realized they didn&#039;t really &quot;know&quot; him, and he wasn&#039;t the person whose mental image they painted in their mind, so  nothing new is surprising anymore.   

(Of course they never knew him, but people thought they understood him in as much as we can think we know or understand an celebrity figure we have grown to admire.  There&#039;s a tendency to paint a more complete mental picture of a person who we can only relate to from afar so as to allow what&#039;s really a shallow bond to feel deeper.  People do it all the time with mucisians, sports figures, politicians, etc.  Once that mental picture is shattered, and people are brought back to the reality that they never really knew the person in the first place, what ever follows isn&#039;t as interesting.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Did you read the post I linked at the beginning of this post that I wrote when he shaved the beard?

I basically said the same thing.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Matisyahu must think that non-chasidic orthodox Judaism (NCOJ) has less rules than chasidic orthodox Judaism (COJ). This is not necessarily the truth. What is true is that COJ has more rules about appearance and external practices than NCOJ. Further, NCOJ is adopting more and more of the COJ appearances and rules on appearance.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[He was already taking flack for the most part before he shaved his beard. People loved him for his music, and for the anti-persona, and novelty of being a Chasidishe star accepted by the masses. But we didn&#039;t make him feel welcome or accepted at home. There are many people in Crown Heights who gave him a hard time for being who he was... It was somewhat inevitable that he would revert when not accepted by the frum community (Even Lipa, an FFB was given a hard time for a long time)

		<description><![CDATA[I knew he was eventually going to leave orthodoxy behind when he shaved his beard, but not because of the shaving part.  It was because of the statement he put out at the same time.  I&#039;m too lazy to go find it right now and I don&#039;t remember it verbatim but he said something about how at one point he felt the need to submit to an ultimate truth and that now he was beyond that.  
Here is the thing, no matter how far left you go, if you are still in the realm of orthodoxy, you must submit to an ultimate &quot;truth,&quot; and even suspend your moral, intellectual, and common sense thinking when it comes into conflict with codified Jewish law.  I&#039;m not saying that there is anything wrong with that for some people, but because Matisyahu didn&#039;t want and/or believe in that anymore, it was just a matter of time.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m wondering how good.  After reading the news yesterday I listened to Chop &#039;em Down b/c I always felt Shake off the Dust was his best, most personal and least &quot;commercial&quot; album.  This time around it didn&#039;t sound so good.  The production quality wasn&#039;t there but I guess that makes sense since this was before Sony Epic signed him.  But somehow the lyrics sounded clunky and boring, the fake reggae grating, and generally uninspired  I&#039;m not sure if I used to convince myself it was good b/c I wanted to like it or now I was convincing myself it wasn&#039;t good b/c I&#039;m disappointed in him. Either way, I don&#039;t see myself following him anymore.   ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think he definitely intended to be a role model but not necessarily to the Orthodox community.  He reached out to those searching for spirituality, but in no way to frum jews.  I think we (I) accepted him as a role model and feel entitled to an explanation but I can see why he would feel differently.  I also can see why he would feel burdened by the Orthodox community - someone of his background, his experiences as a teenager/20 something following Phish etc. is not the type of person to be shackled down.  When he met Chabad at Washington Square Park he was introduced to the Majesty of God and a lot of deep spiritual concepts.  Years later he may have found himself in a prison of expectations.  The content of his music videos and songs over the last 2 years made it clear to me a lot had changed regarding his Shmiras halacha.  Shaving the beard, removing his kippah and payos (?) have cemented that.  He didn&#039;t change his appearance for the same reason a lawyer doesn&#039;t wear a kippah - he passed that bridge a while ago.  Maybe one day he&#039;ll explain more.   ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It goes without saying that a bare-headed male is likely to be considered persona non grata in the orthodox Jewish community.&quot;


The most powerful Orthodox Jew in America is Sheldon Silver, Speaker of the New York State Assembly for the past 19+ years. He does not routinely wear a yarmulke in public. Someone told me that he actually was told by a rabbi not do wear a yarmulke because people might think he is a rabbi. I thought that was a bit silly until I was visiting a small New England city and just from being seen with a yarmulke got greeted by a local Protestant minister and Mormon elder, who each invited me to join the local interfaith council. They knew that one of the local non-orthodox synagogues was looking for a new rabbi and assumed that I must be the new hire!


My other interesting yarmulke story is from Madrid, Spain. I wore my yarmulke all over the city, something Spanish Jews don&#039;t do. One day as I was about to enter the subway a woman comes up to me and tells me, &quot;Sir, your backpack is open.&quot; I reflexively said, &quot;Thank you&quot; and proceeded to the turnstyle. But then I realized that something was wrong. I turned around and caught up to the woman as she reached the top of the stairs at the subway station exit. I asked her, &quot;Excuse me, ma&#039;am, thank you for telling me about my backpack, but how did you know I spoke English?&quot; She looked at me and said, &quot;Its the thing on your head!&quot; Wearing a yarmulke in much of Europe is a sign that you are a tourist.

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you Dan!! It&#039;s not fair to call people superficial who realized that once Matisyahu shaved off his trademark beard, his religious observance was going to follow suit. And I say that as someone who does NOT feel that Orthodox men must have beards. My own husband did not sport a beard for many years &amp; he is currently just as observant now with his little goatee as he was when he was clean-shaven but for Matisyahu the beard seemed to represent his connection with G-d &amp; spirituality &amp; once he gave that up it seems like his Orthodoxy was shifting. That said, he has a right to make his own decisions &amp; does not have to live a life that he is not comfortable living just to please his fans in the Orthodox community. However, I do feel for his wife &amp; children who have to figure out a way to deal with their husband/father &amp; all the changes he is currently going through while they are living in an Orthodox community where Matisyahu&#039;s current &#039;look&#039; &amp; practices may be frowned upon by other community members.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Followers choose a role-model because he represents a certain paradigm to them. When the role-model then embraces this role, he i saying &quot;I will be that paradigm for you and I will deliberately do and say things so that you can learn from me.&quot;

If that person then completely shifts modes, he owes it to his followers to either acknowledge it by saying &quot;I no longer represent this paradigm,&quot; or say &quot;I still do, and here is why I have done something so dramatically different than usual.&quot;

Imagine if you decided to become Christian? Don&#039;t you think your congregants would deserve an explanation?

Again, if Matisyahu never embraced being a role-model that is a different story. Then we could discuss whether becoming  an ipso facto role model comes with the same responsibilities. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you represented this side, and I think you&#039;re right that the orthodox community may hold blame for his struggle. At the same time -- the social conventions you mention aren&#039;t completely unfounded. 

We live in a freer, supposedly more accepting world today, so there should theoretically be no reason for a person not to wear a kipa (except perhaps in extreme circumstances). Especially Matisyahu who was famous for his &quot;jewishness&quot; shouldn&#039;t get any trouble for it. Thus taking it off is more meaningful than it might have been thirty years ago -- it rightly raises suspicions. 
And it&#039;s true that if we were more accepting of the compromises one might have to make to work in the secular music industry, he might have had an easier time. At the same time, we don&#039;t accept that career choice for a reason. It&#039;s creating an identity within an environment that&#039;s basically alien to Jewish observance and values. Anyone who understands the impact of peer pressure and environment should know that taking such a step entails exposing yourself to a lot of &quot;spiritual danger&quot; -- and by the community condemning such steps, I suppose we hope to keep people from getting into that situation. 
Finally, I would have to say that we do own Matisyahu -- at least on some level. He&#039;s our brother and his connectedness to our nation is a concern of all of us. That doesn&#039;t mean he needs to be pressured or guilt-tripped, but that our interest in his religious status is justified, just like our interest in all other Jews. And to see our brother -- who perhaps wrongly was a role model to some of us -- but in the very least was some kind of picture of orthodox Jews to the secular world -- seem to go astray, is disheartening. Maybe the way people express their reaction to his choices is unhelpful -- but their interest is not misplaced.]]></description>

And it&#8217;s true that if we were more accepting of the compromises one might have to make to work in the secular music industry, he might have had an easier time. At the same time, we don&#8217;t accept that career choice for a reason. It&#8217;s creating an identity within an environment that&#8217;s basically alien to Jewish observance and values. Anyone who understands the impact of peer pressure and environment should know that taking such a step entails exposing yourself to a lot of &#8220;spiritual danger&#8221; &#8212; and by the community condemning such steps, I suppose we hope to keep people from getting into that situation.<br />
Finally, I would have to say that we do own Matisyahu &#8212; at least on some level. He&#8217;s our brother and his connectedness to our nation is a concern of all of us. That doesn&#8217;t mean he needs to be pressured or guilt-tripped, but that our interest in his religious status is justified, just like our interest in all other Jews. And to see our brother &#8212; who perhaps wrongly was a role model to some of us &#8212; but in the very least was some kind of picture of orthodox Jews to the secular world &#8212; seem to go astray, is disheartening. Maybe the way people express their reaction to his choices is unhelpful &#8212; but their interest is not misplaced.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I did. His beef was that there was no explanation. If you are a role model - and embrace it like it seemed Matisyahu did - you owe it to your followers to explain, or at least acknowledge, any actions that compromise that role.
If in fact he does not view himself as a role model, well, he should say something like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMzdAZ3TjCA. 
You assume that he is going through something which would be difficult to discuss publically. If so, then yes, he should get some breathing room. But eventually, I think he needs to build up the courage to discuss it.  ]]></description>
