		<description><![CDATA[Excellent article. I think that what you are saying is true: there are three ways to approach it, and none of them are easy if you want to stay orthodox.


For me, the answer is easy, because I have no real reason to avoid option 2. But I can see that if you don&#039;t want to go there, you are in quite a pickle.


Back when I was a firm believer in Torah M&#039;sinai, I took option 1, and I could not understand any other way to approach it. Option 3 seems like equivocation to me, and answer for apologists for orthodoxy. 


I still think that way: Either God knew what he was doing, or he didn&#039;t. If he did, accept it even if you don&#039;t like it. And if he didn&#039;t, why bother? You can&#039;t dance at two weddings...

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think think is an issue that has an &quot;answer.&quot; Every child has different reasons for asking questions and therefore should be answered differently. Isn&#039;t this the message of the four sons? 

As a teacher, I have always found that the most effective manner of dealing with the modern sensibilities question is to validate multiple opinions. There are Orthodox thinkers who approve of certain adaptations, and that adapting the Torah to modem values is not automatically heresy. Additionally, there are those who believe in no change at all, and their opinions are rooted in sources as well.

The most important thing I can convey to my students is that whatever approach they are following, they should make sure they are being honest with themselves, and that they have people who can help them think through their opinions to maintain self-honesty.

Finally, we have to have patience. If a child of four beliefs Vashti had a tail, it is not the end of the world. You have plenty of time to correct that option (if you feel the need) when they are older. The key is to give them what they can handle based on their developmental level and to show respect for their opinions.

		<description><![CDATA[The UJA report pertains solely to New York.

&lt;i&gt;I think the Reform Movement has been predicting the death of Orthodoxy 
for like 200 years, but we&#039;re still here and probably stronger than ever.&lt;/i&gt;

As I said in the other thread, that works both ways - except that you aren&#039;t &quot;stronger than ever&quot;. I don&#039;t want to go through the entire thing again over here. If you&#039;re interested, read what I said there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;You know, the answer to the question of whether or not their numbers are
 declining always seems to be dependent upon the orientation of the 
person to whom I&#039;m speaking. Orthodox people make this claim - it 
appears to be a fallback argument - yet I&#039;ve been told that the Reform 
movement is actually the most rapidly growing, by their own reckoning&lt;/i&gt;



I was thinking of the recently released UJA-Federation of New York&#039;s 
recently released study.  I don&#039;t think they&#039;re looking at it from an 
&quot;Orthodox orientation&quot;.  Article I had read about it is here: 
http://forward.com/articles/157766/changing-face-of-new-york-jewry/?p=all



&lt;i&gt;I don&#039;t know what does qualify as &quot;official doctrine&quot;. Modern Orthodoxy lacks any sort of strong, centralized leadership.&lt;/i&gt;



You&#039;re right that &quot;official&quot; was a poor choice of words.  I should have 
said &quot;mainstream.&quot;   I don&#039;t think any Orthodox yeshiva will back that 
outlook, and if some LWMO yeshiva does, their success at keeping their 
followers committed to an Orthodox lifestyle will drop dramatically in a
 generation.  They &quot;old-timers&quot; may do what they have always done, but 
their kids are going to see through the inherent hypocrisy of staying 
absolutely committed to something that&#039;s admittedly inconvenient at 
times just for tradition&#039;s sake.  



&lt;i&gt;Finally, as I also said in the other thread, as a result of the Haredi 
incursion, the future of Orthodoxy appears to be bleak. It&#039;s difficult 
to predict whether or not it will survive...&lt;/i&gt;

		<description><![CDATA[being 16 years old I&#039;m kind of in between the two stages. In some ways I know that I am still somewhat childish (knowledge, appreciation of things in life, etc.) and yet I feel that I am an adult in other ways. I feel like I can come up with satisfactory answers to many of my questions. I can remember what it was like being a younger child. I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll remember what is was like being 16 ten years from now. I don&#039;t remember asking too many questions as a younger child, at least not any as deeply theological and philosophical as the kind you are talking about. Its very possible that my Rebbeim threw hints to them here or there to avoid certain questions being asked, and some of those ideas may have help form my view of the world. I probably didn&#039;t care if western society would view killing amalek was immoral, or about any other modern sensability vs. Torah contradiction. I loved fantasy novels and the like, so I was fully able to understand all the fantasies mentioned by midrashim etc. I just knew that star wars, pokemon, and the lord of the rings were all fake, but the Torah is true. It was pretty simple. Then I met the real world. I think the reason why I&#039;m still a believing and practicing Jew is because I&#039;ve had excellent Rebbeim who have taught me how to think, not what to think.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mark is correct, in my understanding - Orthopraxy is far more rampant than you are probably aware.

&lt;i&gt;  You can&#039;t gut the G-D or his law from religion and expect to keep adherents. &lt;/i&gt;

That isn&#039;t what they&#039;re doing, particularly not the Conservative movement. You&#039;re operating with a caricatured view. (Also, it certainly isn&#039;t applicable to all religions; ask the Buddhists.)

&lt;i&gt; Any watering down of that message, in the attempt to make religion more
 appealing, is going to fail in the long run just as we&#039;re seeing Reform
 and Conservative numbers drop off.   &lt;/i&gt;

You know, the answer to the question of whether or not their numbers are declining always seems to be dependent upon the orientation of the person to whom I&#039;m speaking. Orthodox people make this claim - it appears to be a fallback argument - yet I&#039;ve been told that the Reform movement is actually the most rapidly growing, by their own reckoning. You folks don&#039;t accept their numbers because you don&#039;t recognize their conversions, and more importantly, because they recognize patrilineal descent and you don&#039;t. I realize that in your view, someone with a Jewish father and a gentile mother simply isn&#039;t a Jew, but they do accept that person, and they don&#039;t care about your opinion any more than you care about theirs. This brings me back to what I said in the other thread; the schism has taken place, and we now have two religions. It&#039;s time we acknowledge it and move on. 

&lt;i&gt;but that can never be considered   official doctrine&lt;/i&gt;

I don&#039;t know what &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; qualify as &quot;official doctrine&quot;. Modern Orthodoxy lacks any sort of strong, centralized leadership. There is no Rav Soloveitchik today. Moreover, a religion is defined by the beliefs and practices of its followers. If more people who self-identify as &quot;Modern Orthodox&quot; believe in a Torah that resulted from a divine-human partnership than believe in one that was fully divinely authored - who has the authority to say it isn&#039;t Orthodoxy? Do you want your ideology defined by Rav Elyashiv?

Finally, as I also said in the other thread, as a result of the Haredi incursion, the future of Orthodoxy appears to be bleak. It&#039;s difficult to predict whether or not it will survive, how it will change, how it will have to change in order to survive, and if what survives will be recognizable as Orthodoxy to the Modern Orthodox of today.

		<description><![CDATA[It would never work as an official position.   Many MO that can be called &quot;orthoprax&quot; might identify with your view, but that can never be considered   official doctrine.   As long as Orthoprax is an under the radar stream within Modern Orthodoxy, we&#039;re fine, not everyone is going to be Orthodox in a classical sense, and it;s great to keep people within the fold even if they do not believe it all.   If it starts to define MO, then we&#039;re in trouble.

 In what I have observed, this view leads to &quot;cheating.&quot;  For example, you&#039;re going to Montana on business, there&#039;s no kosher food nearby... so instead of packing your own, you forgo keeping kosher for a few days.   No big deal, if it&#039;s a man-made dictum.   Without the divine component of mitzvot, Orthodox observance will fall apart over time.  Any watering down of that message, in the attempt to make religion more appealing, is going to fail in the long run just as we&#039;re seeing Reform and Conservative numbers drop off.   You can&#039;t gut the G-D or his law from religion and expect to keep adherents. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You mean, why observe the mitzvot? Why be observant?

I suppose it can be seen as a framework through which to channel whatever feelings of &quot;spirituality&quot; (a term I dislike but for which I haven&#039;t yet found a replacement) one has. I know a Modern Orthodox rabbi who believes the other religions are legitimate vehicles for approaching &quot;the divine&quot;, but Orthodox Judaism is what he was handed by his antecedents. He grew up with it; it&#039;s part of his experiential vocabulary and he finds it meaningful.

Now, he believes in a personal God. His son in law, who is also frum, doesn&#039;t (he&#039;s getting a PhD in Jewish mysticism and his conceptualization of God runs more along those lines). He&#039;s also highly critical of nearly all of Orthodoxy, and is very liberal (probably to the left of Avi Weiss, which is no mean feat here in Boston, where we have no one like Avi and no community like HIR). I&#039;ve asked him why he&#039;s observant, and insofar as I&#039;ve received an answer, it&#039;s been along the lines of Orthodoxy providing a rational framework from which to encounter and engage the world and a transcendent reality.

Then there are people who simply grew up with it, have happy childhood associations and feel comfortable in the community. I spent 35 years making my way painfully through the miasma that is the world&#039;s faith traditions (and came out of it a raging apikorus), and frankly, I&#039;ve found that to be one of the chief motivating factors - perhaps the single most significant - behind religious &quot;conversion&quot;. In the end, for most people, it comes down primarily to being a matter of with whom you want to hang out.]]></description>

How can kosher be a need, yet only a fraction of a fraction of the worlds population &quot;need&quot; it?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always felt that what frustrated me most about the Yeshiva world and to a lesser degree, the frum world (to which I belong), was not so much the lack of &lt;i&gt;answers&lt;/i&gt; to these questions. I long ago realized that most of these questions can&#039;t really be answered. In fact, regarding many of them, if they had answers, then believing in yiddishkeit would be too simple. What frustrated me the most was the lack of an &lt;i&gt;intelligent approach&lt;/i&gt; to dealing with these questions in people who are educators in the Yeshiva world. I spoke to many rebeeim and talmidim in many yeshivas about these things and the fast majority either hadn&#039;t given any thought to these issues or had done so very briefly, accepted a boilerplate explanation from some rebbe and not given the issue any more thought.
I believe that the fact that these people are educators and they even have a sophisticated approach to dealing with the undeniable questions is what drives most of the young people off. You can accept that there are no perfect answers to philosophical questions. You can&#039;t accept having educators and leaders who don&#039;t seemt o have given them much thought.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I wash before bread, I pour the water twice on each hand without alternating hands.  I taught this to my son starting at the age of two.  Sometime later this past year in his two year nursery class (he was already three) they learned to wash hands.   He insisted that it had to be three times and alternating.   What do you do?  Schools teach only one way, when there are a multitude of valid options.  I was just really surprised that already at age three he assumes his father doesn&#039;t know anything and the teacher must be right.  It was a little disheartening.... I didn&#039;t expect to get that until he was a little older.

With regard to midrashic teachings:   I would like to see middle schools start over at Beraishit and teach it in a more sophisticated rational manner, than what may be appropriate the first time the child learns it in 1st grade.]]></description>
