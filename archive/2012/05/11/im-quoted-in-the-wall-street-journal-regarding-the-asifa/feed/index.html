		<description><![CDATA[You are speaking lashon hara about the Gedolim at every turn here. Is that called support?

You are still trashing Gedolim regularly in your comments and posts. You still have no kavod for talmidei chachamim. You never should have posted anything on this. It has only caused harm and has not helped anyone. Many aveiros were violated by you and others here with their comments.

You caused great harm with nothing positive coming out.

Great job &#039;journalist.&#039;

I bet you feel so important to be quoted in the WSJ.

You will not feel that important when you are quoted in the sifrei Shamayim for all the terrible things you caused here.

Look, we all had some questions about this asifa-even the most &#039;yeshivish&#039; pple had them, Hamodia was honest enough and printed a converstaion with some tough questions on the event. The big diff. is they wrote with respect and gave the Gedolim a chance to answer the questions. You attacked right away and wrote for all to see with great chutzpah. You caused chilul Hashem in doing so.

Learn lessons and do teshuva.

&quot;We are all well aware of the dangers of the Internet.  There is a major Asifa scheduled this coming Sunday (May 20) in New York.  The Asifa is one of great importance as it demonstrates that Klal Yisrael recognizes the importance of this issue and we stand together as one to fight the battle.  This is the message the Rav would like us to walk away with.&quot;

Eliyahu Fink, you made a young, pachaz k&#039;mayim, big chutzpah error in all your posts against the asifa and against the Gedolim.

I really hope you took a major lesson from this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it really?  I thought we&#039;ve determined that Rav Matisyahu Salomon is the major rabbinic figure behind the Asifa.  Have you listened to the interview with him that they are publicizing through a call-in line?  He says quite clearly that the Internet is treif for anyone but those who have an absolute need for it, for professional reasons or similar.  But for THOSE people and ONLY those people, they are pushing hard for the requirement of filters.

Given that statement by the real leader behind it, and the ongoing statements by people like Eytan Kobre, I honestly don&#039;t understand, Rabbi Fink, why you still support the event, why you take any satisfaction in its selling out (not too difficult, given the unprecedented communal arm-twisting), and why you would give a positive statement to the WSJ.  I continue to respect you greatly for your nuanced view on things like this, but I&#039;m just curious as to what you were told by the organizers on the phone, to which you have held your faith despite all the publicity to the contrary by the people who are organizing and running the event--pubkic statements which actually reaffirm the skeptical views held by those of us who are bitterly opposed to the Asifa. ]]></description>

<p>Given that statement by the real leader behind it, and the ongoing statements by people like Eytan Kobre, I honestly don&#8217;t understand, Rabbi Fink, why you still support the event, why you take any satisfaction in its selling out (not too difficult, given the unprecedented communal arm-twisting), and why you would give a positive statement to the WSJ.  I continue to respect you greatly for your nuanced view on things like this, but I&#8217;m just curious as to what you were told by the organizers on the phone, to which you have held your faith despite all the publicity to the contrary by the people who are organizing and running the event&#8211;pubkic statements which actually reaffirm the skeptical views held by those of us who are bitterly opposed to the Asifa. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[ MarkSoFla: I understand why it makes news in NYC.  My curiosity was about why a California-based rabbi, of not a particularly right-wing congregation, and having clear views of his own about  Internet would be so interested in spending the better part of a day traveling to and from the east coast at significant expense to be at an event whose basis he feels in flawed and will likely disagree with the presenters even if they&#039;re seen as making  steps in right direction.  

For myself, what&#039;s discussed there may be of passing interest, the same way I might read an article about what was discussed at a Conservative or Reform rabbinical conference.  However, I would not expect to find many centrist Orthodox rabbis going out of their way to attend and delve into who was presenting and what the agenda was, etc.     That&#039;s where I was coming from, when I asked my question.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s true. It is certainly possible. Mind you, a large percentage of the people attending the Asifa would not have a problem with a rebbe beating a talmid so it&#039;s not an issue for them. 
His involvement in the Asifa is certain, but that doesn&#039;t mean the whole Asifa is necessarily a bad idea. 
If he is guilty of these crimes he should face the full brunt of the criminal and civil legal systems and step out of the public eye until he has done teshuva.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While I&#039;m here waiting for the parsha shiur to be posted, I&#039;ll comment on the asifah.  As @efink has written, it&#039;s really about pornography.  The real problem in my mind is the Chareidi world&#039;s inability to deal with sex or sexuality.  We know for a fact particularly among chassidim, the boys are taught nothing about sexuality, that looking down in the shower is assur etc ( I have family who works as a clinical therapist with &quot;ultra-orthodox&quot; so I&#039;m not making anything up).  Now, in the MO world we also may not be taught about sexuality but &quot;at least&quot; we have access to TV, literature and other media which let&#039;s us know during puberty and beyond that our thoughts and desires are normal.   This does not mean that we don&#039;t have problems either of course, but that problems get exasperated in ultra-orthodox communities.  The kids and young adults simply do not know how to deal and have no normal outlet.  These leads to all sorts of problems, this is where stories of dorm room rapes etc and eventually leads to pedophilia.  This somehow leads to thinking a Rabbi can better deal with pedophilia than the police.  

Rav Volbe in zriyah u&#039;binyan writes every child should be pulled aside when age appropriate and discussed with about sex and the kedusha it can bring.  Sex has to stop being taboo and dealt with in a &quot;modern&quot; and more open yet tzniyus way.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[(What secular blogs?  I though only opinionated Jews blogged ;-)   )

While the story may be considered a local interest story in the secular news in areas with large Ultra-orthodox communities, from where I&#039;m sitting, very few people know about it, or if they do, nobody&#039;s talking about it.   Nearly everyone in the community including my rabbi has the Internet, and nobody locally, at least not yet, has gotten up on a soapbox to tell us otherwise.  There are a few right wing families I know who limit the Internet to their smartphone for sending/receiving email, but they are few in number.   Just to share the perception from where I am - it is one of  &quot;Who cares?&quot;  (What ever is said there is not going to change anything in our homes, shul or school...) 

Thank you for answering my question  - I now understand your interest comes more as a journalist/blogger.  Thank you for the time/resources you are willing to devote to your blog, and it&#039;s impressive the passion you have for bringing a sense of journalistic integrity to it.

		<description><![CDATA[(You would not have seen it in the NY Times and Wall Street Journal, not to mention all the secular blogs?)

I care for several reasons. The Internet and its availability is a touchstone issue for the Jewish people. That makes it very relevant. And I would have loved to have been there to observe the spectacle and have first hand information about what it was like. I&#039;d go more as a journalist than anything else.
And I don&#039;t blog for my congregation specifically. My blog is much more popular in NY and Israel than it is in LA.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand why you care about the Asifa.   Why have you felt the need to delve into it&#039;s goals and agenda of the organizers?   Are your congregants in CA concerned about what will be said there?  (I would think not, but maybe I&#039;m wrong?)   If not for you and DB blogging about it, I would never have known it was occurring from my &quot;out-of-town&quot; suburban MO  community - and I wouldn&#039;t feel terribly uninformed if I hadn&#039;t known.   One of the many benefits of living away from NY/Lakewood and their sphere of influence is not being exposed to their nonsense and I for one am generally happier to ignore a lot of what comes out of that element.

What is it about the event that has captivated your interest that you might have flown across the country to be there for it?  ]]></description>
