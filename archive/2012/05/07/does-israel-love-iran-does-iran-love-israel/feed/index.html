		<description><![CDATA[This is an assumption, not a sequence of logical reasoning. You clearly are not a person who is inclined toward hatred. You probably don&#039;t hate total strangers either, any more than you hate people you know.  Some people respond to learning about others with increased hatred for them. Some of the Nazis knew a lot about Jews. Also, if the other guy is likely to kill you (as on the battlefield), you may very well be willing to kill him first even if you don&#039;t hate him. 

I have a feeling that if Ahmedinejad learned more about Jews and Israelis, he would use that knowledge against us. I find it hard to believe it would make him peaceful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No impasse! (though I have to remind you that you still didn&#039;t answer the question)

It&#039;s sort of the inverse (not quite, but close enough) kind of logic. I just don&#039;t see you providing any evidence or proof (since you say it is &quot;logical&quot;, then you must think you have some sort of proof as that&#039;s how logic works) that Knowledge (learning about others) =&gt; less hatred for others =&gt; almost impossible to kill them.

The other huge problem is that knowledge, the soft kind of knowledge, is often subjective and all depends on what someone else told you about something. And that kind of knowledge can lead to hatred or love all depending on how the person telling frames it. I don&#039;t think I have to give examples of this as history is replete with them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually if you kill all your enemies you won&#039;t have any enemies. That is logical. It&#039;s impractical because the more people you kill, the more enemies you are likely to have. 
So, no. My point was logical, yours was not.

		<description><![CDATA[I am specifically referring to your definition of enlightenment as &quot;more knowledge&quot;. For example, Germans were bad and hated Jews and slaughtered them, but with additional knowledge over centuries gained additional capability for more efficient slaughter. Another example, Iran is bad and hates Jews and wants to slaughter Jews, add additional knowledge in the form of nuclear weapons technology and they may be able to more efficiently slaughter Jews. So maybe it doesn&#039;t make the people themselves worse, but it makes the evil effect those people can have far worse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If  leaders of a country need to mass an army, they must pay some attention to what the masses think, or at least to what they will tolerate.  However, if the leaders wish to shoot nuclear armed missiles, if they have them, they need only a handful of people to go along.  I have not heard anyone (other than the peace activists you quote) suggest that Israel might attack Iran&#039;s nuclear program because they hate the Iranians.  Rather, they may act because they fear what the Iranian leaders would do if they develop a nuclear weapon.  That fear may or may not be overblown, but it has little to do with what the average Iranian may think, as that doesn&#039;t seem to affect what the leaders do.  Should one, as some in the US and Israel have argued, dismiss what the Iranian leadership says as mere bluster and assume they will be deterred from using nukes, if they get them, by the fear of retaliation?  I have no idea.  That is what the Israeli leaders have to decide; I am glad that is not my decision.  The lives of large numbers of Israelis, including my children, are at risk whether they act or refrain.

I have not heard anyone (other than the peace activists you quote) suggest that Israel might attack Iran&#8217;s nuclear program because they hate the Iranians.  Rather, they may act because they fear what the Iranian leaders would do if they develop a nuclear weapon.  That fear may or may not be overblown, but it has little to do with what the average Iranian may think, as that doesn&#8217;t seem to affect what the leaders do.  Should one, as some in the US and Israel have argued, dismiss what the Iranian leadership says as mere bluster and assume they will be deterred from using nukes, if they get them, by the fear of retaliation?  I have no idea.  That is what the Israeli leaders have to decide; I am glad that is not my decision.  The lives of large numbers of Israelis, including my children, are at risk whether they act or refrain.   </p>
