		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s fine and dandy to bring Shmitta/Yovel as an example (though not a proof). I have a problem of people bringing examples that Rav&#039;s so-and-so garden is doing exceptionally well on 6th year (when the land is supposed to be the lowest in nutrients). Then why are we not mainstreaming shmitta and yovel in our day? Is it because it&#039;s only a rabbinic mitzvah and not a Torah one? When would it become a Torah one? When Moshiach comes? 

Also, do we have any evidence that up until destruction of Beit HaMikdash Rishon mitzvot of Shmitta and Yovel were observed? 

Same for aliyah l&#039;regel which is a requirement for all able-bodied men. That leaves borders defenseless - do we have any evidence that this mitzvah was observed by the entirety of the Jewish people?

Just because we have mitzvot in the Torah, can we assume that they were observed by vast majority of the population?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[have you &quot;vehemently&quot; looked into the work of secular scholars?  


The biggest problem with this kind of kiruv is that over the
past one hundred and fifty years the case for more than one author of Torah and
its genesis over hundreds of years has only gotten stronger.  And it’s not just the Documentary Hypothesis,
and not just James Kugel.  It’s seven or
so academic disciplines and one hundred and fifty years of arguing, refining,
evolving, discarding. And dozens and dozens of authors (frum, secular,
Catholic, European, American) making contributions to this fascinating field.


 


If kiruv fails it is because it offers up indoctrination and
not education.
