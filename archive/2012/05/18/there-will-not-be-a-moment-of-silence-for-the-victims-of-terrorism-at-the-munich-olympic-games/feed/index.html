		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re probably too young to remember but the real outrages when it happened were:
1) how well the Germans bungled the rescue attempt
2) how the people running the Olympics couldn&#039;t wait to restart the games.
3) this is the only time something on this scale every happened
Many folks firmly believe that if it had been any other national group, especially one from a larger nation, the games would have been cancelled right then and there because of the tragedy.  Instead the Games have refused to acknowledge that the tragedy was anything other than a blip and has tried to forget them as much as possible.  And yes, we believe it&#039;s because Jews were killed and the people running the Games didn&#039;t and don&#039;t give a damn.  Hence the ongoing efforts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s like a white person in America advocating that we don&#039;t need a day to acknowledge MLK because they&#039;re not black.   In the universal community that the Olympic Village would have people think they are, a tragedy took place.  It wasn&#039;t an Israeli tragedy, it was one for the entire Olympic community at the games.  Their fellow athletes had been abducted and killed.   It was a stain on the event.    While we can&#039;t prove it, and we hope that no other county ever suffers such a loss, we &quot;know&quot; in out heats that if it was another country whose athletes were brutally murdered the response would be different.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem I see with your argument is that you ignore what you yourself set forth in the second paragraph.  If you acknowledge what the Games were supposed to be, and that attacks damaged that ideal, then you can&#039;t say it is one country&#039;s tragedy.  The fact is, it&#039;s a tragedy to the entire International Community and to the Games themselves.  Israelis lost their lives, but The Olympics lost its ideal, its lustre.  It was a global tragedy because if how and where it happened.]]></description>
