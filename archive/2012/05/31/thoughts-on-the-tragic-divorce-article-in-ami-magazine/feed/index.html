		<description><![CDATA[I was not accusing you I was responding to all these people who have posted comments. What was the point of this article? It only spirals more hatred out of control. I was hoping you could post articles on fixing what is broken. There are hundreds of ways we can bring our people together in my opinion. Did the guy even get a job in the end. Maybe he is paying child support for a kollel check?! who knows. I just think that we have be positive about all types of Jews. The guy needed help not everyone in kollel is like this poor guy.  We have to love everyone-it&#039;s a mitzva. Maybe we should use our time creating positive in the world not G-d forbid the opposite.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But that&#039;s the entire point! Not &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; should be learning full-time. Maybe for the first year, but then the top 10% stay and the bottom 90% learn a trade and go to work. Same as graduate school. Then after another year or two, the top 10% stay and the bottom 90% leave to go to work. Then whoever is remaining is the top 1%, they learn for 5 years or so and then again you pick the top 10% and the bottom 90% go to work. That&#039;s how you cultivate gedolim.


And we need Rabbis .... but not that many Rabbis!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not sinas chinam, sinas kollel. I think the kollel lifestyle renders most men useless to the world (useless to their family, to their community, and to their country). That is, except for the precious few that actually become the next generation of gedolim. And very, very, very few actually reach that point. It ends up becoming a sad waste of a life. It is especially bad in Israel where 56% of Charedi men are unemployed, and another 25% are underemployed because they wasted the years of their life that they were supposed to be serving the country and then learning a trade.


For the good of your family, I sincerely hope your husband escapes the kollel lifestyle as soon as possible and learns a good trade so he can properly support his family. If he is stuck there much longer, he will become useless and if he is lucky might be able to beg a mashgiach job or cheder rebbe job from the powers that be (and that only if he has good connections) and end up living in poverty for the rest of your lives. That is *NOT* what the Torah demands of us.

And, by the way, I think you mean that you &quot;take great offense&quot;, not &quot;take great defense&quot;.]]></description>

Has anyone ever thought to get over themselves and stop bashing our own people? We as Jews are one and let me tell you until we start acting this way we are heading down a scary path! Enough statements about Kollel and frum people and brainwashing!!! I have had enough! Rabbi E. Fink maybe you should find a way to bring klal yisroel together instead of cutting us in half!!! Post articles to bring Moshiach...not send him away!!! V&#039;ahvta lereiacha Comocha! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is all nice and good. But honestly what are the Rabbis doing to help men be able to make a living in the first place. They are the biggest one to blame as I am sorry to say they use the bully pulpit to hurt men that don&#039;t have a bully pulpit and the women like this idea of men not working because then they control all area&#039;s of a marriage both financial and in terms of the children. It shows a tremendous hatred towards men and to be honest men that don&#039;t want to a work have a sense of entitlement. So the issue of children is actually far down the list of problems here. No even just financial but to be honest neither parent is fit to raise a child with this kind of mentality. They would be better put up for adoption in a healthy marriage. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One would think so, but Rabbi Fink contacted the editorial staff at Ami, and they told him it&#039;s legitimate.

I wasn&#039;t troubled by the fact that he does&#039;t seem to be aware of how selfish and clueless he sounds. In that world, this is what they&#039;re brought up to expect, and he was obviously told he was a hot property. Furthermore, I can sort of see his side of it. If he&#039;s telling the truth, the girl and her parents do seem to have misled him - but I don&#039;t really blame her, either. I blame the rabbis who keep them locked in this state, at the cognitive and developmental level of children, generation after generation, so they can maintain their power base. It&#039;s reprehensible, it&#039;s a form of child abuse and it should no longer be tolerated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I thought of all your points and I agree with you fully. One more point that I thought was very strong is that he is almost throwing himself in traffic by the tone he takes. If this were a true story written by a guy who was sophisticated enough to write on this level, he would have to be aware that he comes off looking terrible, but there is NO tone of self defense here. Nothing to make himself come off looking legitimate.

My theory is like some others have already written here, it was written by someone with an agenda to highlight the points they dont like about this &#039;kollel generation&#039; and they want people to be enraged. But no matter what, I am really confused why Ami would print it. First I am amazed that they would believe this story, and second, how could they not pick up the negativeness it pours on the frum community. At least that much I would assume goes against their grain.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It certainly sounded true &#038; believable - specifically because how annoyed it made me.
If they received this &quot;True&quot; article in the mail, how have they verified its content? It does seem possible it was written (by the wife?) to slander the husband.


If AMI know it is true, (from the husbands perspective), I&#039;d like to hear about it from the womans perspective; and then hear the real story from an outside source. There are always three stories in a case of divorce!


That being said, it brings to light the sad situation that is happening in Lakewood (and to other &quot;learning&quot; couples) and how unsustainable the system is and how corrupt the chinuch is, in Chareidi Institutions for people to turn out like this (although extreme, this story is not so uncommon).


Some other thoughts: What happened to his parents? Do they not have an opinion / help / advise him? 


He wanted to be a &#039;bench warmer&#039; for life. Sadly, they rarely exist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@twitter-37716191:disqus &lt;i&gt;Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have a proposal as to how it can be decided who is a yachid sagul (?) and who is not.  &lt;/i&gt;



I have a great proposal. First of all, who can determine it? Obviously the previous yechidei segulah can do it since they were the best of the best and only got better with more decades of learning. Second of all, how to do it? Very simply, you tell the Rabbonim that each year they get to keep the top-10% of their students. So the community starts with 10,000 students (let&#039;s say in Israel for arguments sake). At the end of the year, 9,000 leave and get trained for a job, and 1,000 remain. Then at the end of that year, 900 leave and go to work, and best 100 remain. And then at the end of the next year, 10 remain, and 90 go to work. Those 10 are the yechidim, the absolute best of the best, and they will be the next generations gedolim as they grow up and learn more and more.


Obviously the numbers can be adjusted as necessary, but this is the basic structure of how it should work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@b131b4f2b76eb707ee852cd574aefdf8:disqus 
This story does represent a fundamental flaw in the yeshiva/kollel system, whether or not Rabbi @efink:disqus intended to bring it to light in this specific post. 


The system puts a burden on the rest of the Jewish people (parents, relatives, friends, and strangers) that is not justified. The yechidei segula (by definition, a small minority of the entire Orthodox community) are the only ones who should be supported in their full time learning. This group should include those worthy individuals from all walks of Orthodox life, not just those that want to learn in Lakewood. 


I don&#039;t believe it is appropriate for Rabbonim to recommend this lifestyle for the masses. If the &quot;dude&quot;/protagonist/antagonist of the article is one of these yechidei segulah, it is truly unfortunate that things did not work out for him as they could in an ideal world. That is a function of this system being broken, with resources going to those who don&#039;t deserve them. It is a system that is easily taken advantage of. 


Unfortunately, I don&#039;t have a proposal as to how it can be decided who is a yachid sagul (?) and who is not. Hopefully there are askanim and Rabbonim out there who are already working on such issues. If there could ever be a consensus among Orthodox leaders (!) as to how to filter out those that are truly worthy, this would alleviate much of the financial burden that the kollel system places on the rest of the Jewish people (and it might bring Mashiach too!) Funds could be freed up for other causes that are just, and new funds, from the increase in the Orthodox working population, would be available for donation. 


This all stems from the massive chasm that exists between the different paths of Orthodox Judaism. Unfortunately, until tolerance is promoted and worlds are united, solutions to the underlying issues stemming from this religious gap will be hard to come by.   ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This article is heartbreaking. First, because, indeed, a rational person does want to strangle the guy (he comes across as pompous, selfish, somewhat stupid and lazy), and second (most importantly) because these two people are completely delusional. They were raised on false ideals, with shallow goals and beyond reality. I find many of these yeshivish families have serious problems communicating. Some families insist on talking about nothing but Torah topics at the expense of children who want to talk/vent about their day, couples who need to talk about the &#039;mundane&#039; (yes, sometimes the lint filter in the dryer is an important topic) and the family who needs to discuss finances! This lifestyle takes the &#039;me&#039; culture to a whole new level. What will become of those poor children who will now NEVER be accepted in the chareidi community because their parents are (whisper this) divorced?]]></description>

The take-away message is that he married his wife for the money and therefore felt cheated when money was not forthcoming.

Note that he says, in the beginning that his kallah had the best possible midot. Never, in the whole article, does he say that her midot were not as good as expected. (Indeed, she works her ass off, commutes because Mr. husband does not want to change kollel, etc). It just says he divorced because she had less money than he expected.

Not once, not once, did this &#039;frum&#039; guy- the star of the Yeshiva, ever say- &quot;You know, it was a surprise, but Gam Zu L&#039;tova, its all from Hashem, and if thats what He declared, then thats what I&#039;ll do&quot;. Gd is sorely lacking from this picture that is supposedly all about serving Him...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The one criticism I disagree with is that the wife should have had a more realistic sense of the job market in her field before going into debt. This is a very common problem with college grads today, but it can take years to get a degree and the job market can change considerably during that time. There is just no way to predict based on what the job market is like when you start, what it will look like when you finish. By the time you realize it you may be in too far to just walk away or change to a different career plan. I was in a very similar boat, having invested years of effort into getting a degree in what I thought was a very promising field but that turned out to have not nearly as much opportunity as expected. That&#039;s life and I&#039;m not blaming anyone else for this, but I don&#039;t think that the wife should be blamed for not having the gift of prophecy to know what the job market would look like in five years. Anyway, to me it looked like the wife was doing her best to cope with a bad situation and if she can be blamed for anything it was for being naive and optimistic for too long and putting up with her husband&#039;s cr@p long past the point when it was obvious the marriage was a failure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Boy I wish I could find a dumb girl with rich folks to support my reading habits. too bad she was too dumb to warn me about her 100,000 student loan debt from her ivy league school and I was too dumb to ask her about her financial situation before we got hitched. Oh and we had 4 kids even though we can&#039;t afford them. Also I&#039;d rather be poor than get a job because reading is more important than feeding and clothing my kids OBVIOUSLY. NONE OF THIS IS MY FAULT. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Two kids max isn&#039;t statistically enough for a sustainable Jewish population. And I say this as someone who&#039;s only planning on having two kids, because day school tuition is nightmarish around here. I greatly respect families who have a lot of kids, it&#039;s tough work, but they don&#039;t tend to get a ton of sympathy from me on the financial side. You made that bed, sleep in it. If G-d wanted you to have more money, He would have given it to you, right? If G-d REALLY wants me to have more kids, He knows how to make that work (a possibility that I have contingency plans for financially, BTW).

I have no idea why birth control is such a controversial issue in the community. The Talmud flat-out says that women can PERMANENTLY STERILIZE themselves with no problem, because the mitzvah of prur ur&#039;vu is only on men. I don&#039;t get why modern birth control, which is both temporary and reversible, is such a problem. I can almost understand why they want people to have kids early - you don&#039;t want to deal with fertility problems when the woman is 35 - but the problems with BC in general, that&#039;s weird to me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This line from the article really bothers me:


&lt;i&gt;&quot;My rosh yeshiva seemed disappointed, too. After all, I had once been the bochur with so much potential. I was supposed to be a lifelong learner, but that didnt seem possible anymore.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;


Is that really the goal for those with potential? Just to sit cloistered and study all day? Extended full-time limud Torah used to be to train leaders. Is the means now the end?
