Click: <a href="http://www.xojane.com/relationships/hasidic-women-sex" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.xojane.com/relationships/hasidic-women-sex', 'XOJane');" target="_blank">XOJane</a>)</em></p>
<p>I am very happy that you have found personal satisfaction in your religious life. I am also happy you took to the Internet to profess your love for your personal relationship with God (and apparently your husband). I honestly wish every orthodox Jewish woman was as religiously fulfilled as you are. However, sadly this is not the case.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the real issues I take with your effusive article.</p>
<p>You represented your subjective experience as the objective experience of chasidic women. Making things worse, you failed to disclose in the article many important factors that contributed to your personal experience. Indeed, you made them clear in the comments, but it was too little, too late.</p>
<p><span id="more-5610"></span></p>
<p>You were not born into orthodox Judaism. That means that you actually chose the life you live. That&#8217;s amazing and I am so happy for you that you arrived at what I believe to be the truth on your own. But the simple fact is that people who are born into orthodox Judaism don&#8217;t choose it. This means that they are stuck. For better or for worse. Some people are thrilled to be stuck. Others, not so much. But this means that while you feel like you are free to as you please. I am sure you realize that if an orthodox woman would put on &#8220;pants and go snort coke&#8221; she would probably be asked to leave the community and be handed a quick divorce and lose custody of her children. So it is not as free as you intimate. It might feel free to you because you chose it. But it is not free.</p>
<p>The second thing that you did not disclose, and this is a far more egregious error, is that you are a member of the Chabad sect of chasidus. The reason this is so crucial is because Chabad is different than every single other chasidic sect. There are absolutely no social correlations between Chabad and the other sects of chasidus. None.</p>
<p>In the words of Hella Winston (quoted from <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/04/29/book-review-unchosen/" target="_blank">Unchosen</a>):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>With its “mitzvah tanks”, campus Chabad houses, celebrity stuffed fundraising telethons, and outposts across the globe, Lubavitch has become almost synonymous with Hasidism. This despite the fact that in the United State it numbers less than half the size of Satmar and is hardly representative of the Hasidic community as a whole. With their mission – unique in the Hasidic world – to attract unaffiliated Jews, Lubavitchers are raised to engage (Jewish) outsiders, doing missionary work wherever Jews are found around the world. [&#8230;]</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This emphasis on proselytizing has meant that a significant percentage of Lubavitchers were not born in the community but joined by choice. Often those who join [&#8230;] have led formerly secular lives, which likely included a college education or beyond. [&#8230;] Additionally, Lubavitch raises a substantial amount of money from non-Hasidic Jews [&#8230;]. All of this is strong contrast to the other Hasidic sects, which include Satmar, Ger, Viznitz, Belz, Bobov, Skver, Sponka, Pupa and Breslow, to name only a few. In these sects, almost all members are born into the community, and none engages in formal outreach, making them comparatively more insulated from , and less aware of, the ways of the outside society than their counterparts in Lubavitch.</em></p>
<p>You see, the insular chasidic sects bear no resemblance to this world you love. Their world is even more closed and more insular. So your personal experience, while wonderful, has no relevance to the world of chasidic women in the insular sects of Satmar, Ger, Vizhnitz, Square, etc. More importantly, their world is a world where women are more oppressed than in the rest of orthodox Judaism. There are rules against driving, getting an education, men and women walk on separate sides of the street in some communities, there are very strict rules about sex, many women shave their heads, girls are wed after extremely short meetings to young men they barely know, they must wear synthetic (bad looking) wigs, can&#8217;t wear latest fashions (even the modest ones), I could go on and on. The point is that in these communities, women don&#8217;t feel the great freedom and empowerment that you feel.</p>
<p>Ironically, by ignoring all this omitted information, you are causing a disservice to chasidic women everywhere. You make it sound like things are all honky-dory. But they are not. I am sure many chasidic women love their lot in life. But your experience has no bearing on theirs. In fact, I would bet you wouldn&#8217;t last a week in Kiryas Joel or New Square! The things you love about your Judaism are simply not present in those uber-insular communities.</p>
<p>But the most difficult thing about your article is that it completely ignores that plain fact that in halacha, women can easily be perceived as second class citizens. This is an incontrovertible fact. Women cannot be rabbis, cantors, judges, witnesses in Beis Din, and they aren&#8217;t counted as part of a minyan. Women&#8217;s dress codes are medieval, their stained underwear is checked by rabbis, they are discouraged from using contraception, they don&#8217;t study the most important text of orthodox Judaism &#8211; the Talmud (because they are assumed to have weaker minds), and they don&#8217;t take positions of authority. Heck the women in Crown Heights are not even allowed to vote on communal issues! I am well aware of the various apologetics and interpretations of these rules. It could be argued that women have an elevated role and do not require the encumbrances of mitzvah observance. I have used them and taught them myself. Some people buy those explanations, but many others do not. It&#8217;s great that so many orthodox Jewish women are happy with their place in orthodox Judaism, but it is completely reasonable for women inside the system and outside the system to perceive orthodox Judaism as oppressive to women.</p>
<p>In sum, I respect your healthy exuberance for your Chabad lifestyle. I think it&#8217;s great. Share the love. By all means. But please do not generalize and use terms like &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; to describe your personal experience. Not only is it disingenuous, it actually harms the cause of those who are trying to advocate for women&#8217;s rights and opportunities in the chasidic and otherwise orthodox Jewish women. The future of orthodox Judaism will need to make adjustments to the way we deal with women issues (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/06/13/the-future-of-women-in-orthodox-judaism/">The Future of Women in Orthodox Judaism</a>). Pretending it is perfect as it is, sets us backwards several decades.</p>

<p>second reading your other articles on what women are called in the Talmud, have you seen what it calls men? we are lambasted as much if not more than women. <br />
thirdly seeing in your other article on the call for greater scholarship for women, this is ok but it&#8217;s a red herring. firstly women are not commanded to learn Torah men are. when we can barely afford for every boy to go to yeshiva wasting money on it for women is indeed negative, secondly assuming infinite resources, that is not the gist of the article.<br />
 nobody encourages keeping down women nor are they considered second class citizens. anyone who actually educates themselves could easily dispel this notion(read moshe meiselmans book jewish women in jewish law for example) would know that not only are women not second class but indeed seem to be held in higher regard. the reason for them not being counted in a minyan has to do with metaphysics not classes of poeple. for example kings are forbidden from being witnesses. are we going to claim kind David and Solomon were unfairly discriminated against because of this? do we have to bring abuse and mistreatment of women to an end in our communities? yes as the same thing with men and everyone.<br />
but at least we are moving in the right direction as opposed to the world at large. <br />
furthermore it&#8217;s not our problem how the world perceives our actions, it&#8217;s theirs. our job is to keep to halacha.</p>

By you saying:  &#8220;But the most difficult thing about your article is that it completely ignores that plain fact that in halacha, women can easily be perceived as second class citizens. This is an incontrovertible fact. Women cannot be rabbis, cantors, judges, witnesses in Beis Din, and they aren’t counted as part of a minyan. Women’s dress codes are medieval, their stained underwear is checked by rabbis, they are discouraged from using contraception, they don’t study the most important text of orthodox Judaism – the Talmud (because they are assumed to have weaker minds), and they don’t take positions of authority&#8221; &#8211; YOU are the one completely undermining a womans place in Judaism!!!!! you might be playind devil&#8217;s advocate, but for the vast majority of readers here who do not have inside knowledge into each of these very complex issues (such as the reaon women are not judges etc) you have destroyed their perspective on women in these Jewish circles and have been over on the lo taase of motzi shem ra!!!!!!!!!  perhaps a prefered response should have been with regard to the vulgar intonation the article was written with which to me is missing the necessary tzniut every jewish woman (regardless of how happy she is) should have&#8230;.</p>

<p>Dalya, that&#8217;s a modern apologetic that all of us have heard ad nauseum.. And every person who presents it acts as if it&#8217;s some giant revelation that those of us critical of womens&#8217; roles in Orthodoxy must have never heard before. Yes, it&#8217;s become the defensive party line, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less a manufactured apologetic. And your comment is precisely the attitude R Fink was criticizing in the post &#8211; just because you are happy with your role in Orthodox Judaism doesn&#8217;t mean that you speak for all women in Orthodox Judaism.</p>

 &#8216;But the most difficult thing about your article is that it completely ignores that plain fact that in halacha, women can easily be perceived as second class citizens. This is an incontrovertible fact.&#8217;<br />
Well if it&#8217;s a question of perception then it&#8217;s not a fact, is it. Facts are objective, perceptions are subjective. Clearly, people can perceive halacha in all sorts ways which are function of their preconceptions and this is a good example. So please, enough with the &#8216;plain fact&#8217; nonsense. I score you zero for logical accuracy and lower for clear Torah perception. </p>

The simple fact that Halachically, woman can not testify in court, is enough to show that they are deemed second class citizens. THis is not a mitzva issue, it&#8217;s a legal one.

You can be on the same &#8220;level&#8221; as someone but be completely different, have different strengths, different weaknesses. Women are not allowed to testify because we are more compassionate and more likely to bend judgement in favor of compassion. That does not mean we are unequal, it means we are made differently.

<p>So black people had a special role to play. Sitting in the back of the bus, not allowing them to drink from &#8220;white&#8221; water fountains or enter &#8220;white&#8221; restaurants was all part of respecting their higher plane.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-8860" class="dsq-comment-message"><p> Oh, please. Do you mean to tell me that all women are more compassionate than all men? Have you never seen women with iron-clad wills, or a strong sense of justice?<br />
Women are successful court judges and it seems to work just as well for them as it does for male court judges.<br />
Applying an across-the-board generalization about what a particular race or sex is not only intellectually dishonest, it also denies the reality that  I am sure even you have seen with your own eyes.<br />
You need to understand that Talmudic generalizations of what a woman supposedly is was only relevant to those times, and is completely irrelevant and archaic in today&#8217;s society. Women in the Talmudic area, with rare exceptions, were uneducated, so of course they were seen as &#8220;weak minded&#8221;. Intelligence, while it is genetically innate, can only become apparent when it is cultivated and nourished. And women&#8217;s &#8220;compassion&#8221;, in the era of the Talmud, could easily be confused with &#8220;submission&#8221;. In a society where men were law makers and rulers of the household, it was only the men who had the authority to mete out punishment, and not the role of the woman. Just because she never had the authority of a &#8216;punisher&#8217;, that does not make her compassionate.<br />
On a lighter note, let&#8217;s have a look at our lives today&#8230;for example, I remember that when I was growing up, I always knew that if I wanted something, I was more likely to get a &#8220;yes&#8221; from Dad, then from Mom, and by plenty of my childhood friends it was the same. A more extreme example, particularly in light of the frustrating bureaucracy in Israeli society: bursting into tears in front of a man to get what you want is more likely to work than bursting into tears in front of a woman.<br />
And did you not have/know female school-teachers and shule committee board members/ chessed society leaders that everyone, including men, are terrified of?<br />
Does it really seem like women are &#8220;always&#8221; more &#8220;compassionate&#8221; then men?<br />
In order to make things easier for orthodox women, even in a halachic context, the first thing we have to do away with is archaic stereotypes. </p>

But she&#8217;s not so happy with her life. At home, her husband doesn&#8217;t lavish her with jewelry or clothes, in fact, he begrudges her every penny she spends, even on their children. He stops visiting her bed though she faithfully goes to the mikveh. He&#8217;s short tempered and yells. Eventually he starts hitting and hurting her. She doesn&#8217;t have the education or ability to get a &#8220;meaningless job&#8221; to support herself and the children, and she&#8217;s told by the rabbi that it&#8217;s her job to stay and make the marriage work, that being smacked isn&#8217;t that big a deal.</p>
<p>What does she do?</p>
<p>Equality is security. Be happy with your life by all means, but please recognize that beyond your life there are thousands of circumstances that aren&#8217;t yours.</p>

G-d has passed all those &#8220;precious moments&#8221; out of her life when He made her unable to conceive, yet she is looked down upon in the community precisely for the thing that is out of her control -for not being able to procreate, and for investing effort and interest into her career.  The paradigm of becoming the ultimate in Jewish femininity (the different but equal goal) is unattainable.</p>
<p>And what about those that have to go to those &#8220;meaningless jobs&#8221; in order to afford the astronomical bills of a family that they are halachikly unable to limit and a husband who is well meaning but never received the right type of education while in yeshivah to support tuition bills and yom tovim, let alone a rental apartment and health insurance.  Do not forget that everyone does not live like you, and its not for a lack of wanting.</p>

She finds herself a Rabbi or a Rebbetzin who will listen to understand. She needs to understand that it is true that it is extremely important to fight for one&#8217;s marriage and family but it is also extremely important to understand how one needs to be respected and treated and if a spouse crosses the line and does not treat her according to the Torah and Halacha, and a Rabbi refuses to acknowledge that, find another Rabbi who does and who is well versed in Shalom Bayis issues.  Go back to your own Kallah teacher or call a Kallah teacher for help.  No where in the Torah or Halacha does it say that a husband has the right to abuse his wife or his children.   No where in your kesuba does it say that either.  No where in your chassidus is it condoned.  Just because a person crowns himself with the title of Rabbi does not mean that he is capable of dealing, handling or even understanding the intricacies of marriage and human nature, nor does it mean that he has the knowledge, compassion, warmth, kindness and generosity of spirit to lead a Kehilah .  One must be very careful in choosing their Rav and the Kehilah they join even within any particular chassidus.  And every Kallah teacher should teacher the warning signs of trouble brewing and when to go to a Rav and/or a therapist at the very first sign of trouble.</p>

Do they get showered with clothes and jewelery and get to watch their kids in the sun all day? I realize that most Hassidic men in NY are businessmen, but that is certainly not the case in Israel. I understand that many young women are educated in schools and seminaries to believe that working your fingers to the bone and never seeing your kids, and living in grinding poverty on a single minimum wage is a holy sacrifice for the Torah.<br />
Again, I think that Rav Fink is not denying the positive experiences of many chassidic and litvish women, he is simply taking issue with those individuals who use their positive experiences as a justification to deny or ignore real issues concerning women in the orthodox world. </p>

Sure women have far more career and educational opportunities post Feminism than pre-Feminism  but have their lives really improved from a fulfillment and happiness perspective? Rabbis have, wisely so,  never acted impulsively to embrace all the ism movements for good reason&#8230;many as we know have been colossal failures. Please take the time to read a far more balanced presentation on Women and Judaism than Chaya, Deborah or you have offered as all of the articles thus far seem to claim an exclusive window into the souls of Orthodox women.</p>

But I have done a lot of my own research, academic and anecdotal, and I have come to a different conclusion than you. And that&#8217;s okay. Just one thing that I ask you to consider, when Chazal made their rulings on women 2000 years ago, everyone agreed with those rulings because they conformed to their time and place. Do you really think that their time and place did not influence their rulings?</p>

<p>&#8220;Interestingly enough, Adam was not split down the middle; rather, Eve was created from an internal organ: his rib. By mentioning the rib, the Torah is teaching us a principle in understanding the nature of masculine and feminine strengths, namely that feminine manifestation and strength is more internal, while the masculine focus and expression is more external.The feminine internal nature can be observed in the enormous weight women place on relationships, which by definition are personal and private. Modern psychology confirms this key distinction. The best-selling book, “Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus” by Dr. John Gray, advances the idea that women are more “relationship-based” than men.&#8221; <br />
An Orthodox (mainstream)woman as you well know is certainly not prohibited from pursuing a career and hence there are many, in my circle included, who work as physicians, attorneys, business owners etc. alongside  juggling responsibilities of family life. Yet all of these professionally successful and highly educated women are in agreement that at the end of the road their most important and meaningful contribution is their role as a wife and mother and it&#8217;s ultimate impact to the survival of the Jewish people. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m a professional (sociology professor) and have a PhD, and at the end of the road I left the jewish community.   And my role as a wife (and I&#8217;m not a mother yet- also because of my career) is secondary to my role as a sociology professor. I even was left by my frum ex fiance because I wanted to go to grad school and he didn&#8217;t want me to have a career, and I would not give that up for him.  I&#8217;m married now (to someone else), but before I got married me and my husband came to an agreement that he would always follow my career- and I wouldn&#8217;t have married him if he didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Anyway my point is you have a &#8220;confirmation bias&#8221; of people being happy with that role- because the people like me (and like many other women I know) who are not content with having wifehood and motherhood be the main focus of our lives- a lot of us leave the community, or at least because a lot more modern orthodox so that they can do both. </p>

What Judaism really is. It’s a place where there are no second class citizens. Where people may have different roles, where the world is drastically different from the world that surrounds us, but no one is lower class, whether they are a man, women, Cohen, High Priest, Levite, child or leper, and everyone is holy in their own way. http://popchassid.com/respecting-chaya-baal-teshuvas/</p>
<p>To cipher We all drink &#8220;kool aid&#8221; of some form or another and I would venture to guess that you are not immune. It&#8217;s a matter of what value system we choose to embrace and being the pragmatic scientist that I am  I choose to stick with what has lasted for thousands of years vs the value system of  &#8220;progressive&#8221; cultures that have long disappeared.</p>
<p>To abandoning Eden It is surely within your G-d given right to pursue your passions in life and structure your priorities. I sincerely wish you much success. At the same time if all women would choose your priorities we would have long disappeared as a society and culture. Motherhood is quite abstract to you now but should you ever choose to have children you may see things very differently. Most of the women I have referred to were where you are right now and are still quite passionate about their work but at the same time know that their true legacy lies in the investment that they make in their families.</p>

If you believe that allows you to disagree with them on Halachic principles (or their &#8220;rulings&#8221;) then you have left normative Orthodoxy. You may have no issue with that, but if it is true it is deceptive to call yourself an Orthodox rabbi.</p>

Conditioning has nothing to do with normative, majority etc. In addition your logic is flawed, because you choose America as your sample size.

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-8487" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Excellent post Rabbi; one that I hope reaches just as many people as Chaya Kurtz&#8217;s. Personally I am consistently disappointed by the portrayal of Chassidim and of Orthodox Jews in general in the media. Far too many people offer distorted or misleading information regarding these subjects. And in general, those in the frum community who disagree with the representation may censor themselves because communal approval is everything in the frum community. Well unless you are older and have no children or grandchildren who shidduch prospects might be impaired!</p>
<p>In general what I&#8217;ve seen in regards to this topic is two opposite extremes &#8211; the &#8220;Chaya side&#8221; and the &#8220;Deborah Feldman&#8221; side. Neither one is a good representation of Chassdic women in my humble opinion. Most women&#8230;.no most people, Chassidic or not, have a bias towards what they know and what they find comfortable. It is fine to publically talk about yourself, your experiences and your preferences; but it is not ok to put yourself out there as a representative for a larger community in regards to these issues.</p>
<p>The Chassidic Jewish community has social issues&#8230;it&#8217;s true. However outside of not making excuses and sugar-coating things, I think that there is little that can be done or that even should be done. Except for maybe something similar to what the Amish do and the young people are allowed to go out into the larger world for a year, and then come back to the society with an expanded worldview.</p>

having one good observation, that she isn’t chasidish so it’s a<br />
misrepresenatation is otherwise mired in offensive garbage. I’d like to break<br />
this down.</p>
<p>First, comparing her to a woman who chooses to wear pants an<br />
d snort coke. Yes, child services will take away ANY child from a mother<br />
breaking the law … that you chose to combine the two extremes, does not make<br />
the point, it subtracts. </p>
<p>Furthermore you quoted from ‘Unchosen’, which focuses on one<br />
or two rather oddball characters that were outcasts in their community. They<br />
would have been outcasts in any situation, not necessarily Orthodox Judaism. I<br />
can personally verify in my knowing Statmir women, she absolutely and correctly<br />
portrayed their freedoms.  That you<br />
personally don’t identify with some of the external measures they take, ie. Shaving<br />
their heads or short term dating, <br />
fabulous.  You don’t identify with<br />
this sect or the others mentioned. </p>
<p>You bet “she wouldn’t last a week in Kiryas Joel or New<br />
Square”.  What is this an Adam Sandler<br />
film? Should I shout out “Odoyle rules” as you continue to bully with your lame<br />
taunts … Yes, some can perceive in halacha women as second class citizens. Ok,<br />
that’s an OPINION last time I checked, not an incontrovertible fact.  </p>
<p>You sir, are not advocating for ANY women’s rights. Your<br />
letter was rude, disrespectful, and childish. You wish to be respected and<br />
heard? Write a letter to Chaya, showing her dignity and respect!  Just because you don’t agree doesn’t give you<br />
the right to mock her. I’m embarrassed for this article. </p>

Even where I live, there are two, but one is not always accessible or in the greatest of shape. Still we have women driving as far as 5 hours to our west to use it (passing a few Orthodox shuls along the way).</p>

<p>In our culture, the loudest, most visible person is the most important.  Hundreds of reality shows testify to this philosophy.  And yet behind every great visible triumph, the real accomplishment was done by people you never hear about.  Obama gets credit for killing Bin Ladin, but please.  He. Had nothing to do with it. And in my field in science, professors get all the accolades, but everyone knows they did next to nothing, and most of the work was done by an underpaid and overworked grad student.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not entirely convinced that being a Rabbi of a shul or a Yeshiva equals greatness.  In my community, few people stick behind any one Rabbi, but a certain woman in that community is known and universally beloved for what she does.  </p>

When one leaves the &#8220;greater&#8221; world where there are more people in numbers but more tenuous bonds, they are actually gaining a community, that will welcome them home as if they were always a part of it. When one leaves orthodoxy, they are leaving that support structure and the insularity that shielded them from the pitfalls associated with real life. When they go out into the &#8220;greater&#8221; world there is no one to meet them and show them the ropes there is no &#8220;Aish&#8221; for not being orthodox. Therefore it is extremely difficult, more importantly if you are like Chaya, or even like yourself, in the sense that you chose to be orthodox, even if your family and friends shunned you&#8230; it is temporary in the sense that if you left they would accept you back immediately, providing the necessary support structure and ex frum from birth wouldn&#8217;t have.</p>

The mentoring aspect, the teaching aspect, outside respect for the position, etc. Even the debates I had in grad school were similar to the good gemarah debates I had as a kid before the campaign to drive me out of my dad&#8217;s gemerah group began (a few guys &#8211; not my dad- would sneer and say &#8220;is that what you think princess?&#8221; whenever I said anything, and would not respond to my comments ever)</p>

<p>So was your leaving Judaism an intellectual issue with it? Sounds like it was an emotional yearning for something else if you are admitting had you been a rabbi you would have stayed.</p>

I sincerely wish you much success. At the same time if all women would choose your priorities we would have long disappeared as a society and culture. Motherhood is quite abstract to you now but should you ever choose to have children you may see things very differently. Most of the professional women I have referred to were where you are right now and are still quite passionate about their work but at the same time know that their true legacy lies in the investment that they make in their families.</p>
<p>From your writings on your blog you have apparently and sadly developed many negative associations with Orthodox Judaism or Judaism all together for that matter based on a series of unfortunate  traumatic experiences in your life, one of which we share (the monstrous B.L). Yes, Eden, we do  agree that there is much work to do in the tikun olam arena in our communities and advocating for the rights of children is long overdue. I also know this all to well as I am not speaking abstractly but from an all to painful personal perspective &#8230;  Yet where we part ways is, as tempted as I was, I chose not to jump ship and run when things looked rather bleak , not to to take the road of bitterness and cynicism and instead chose to recognize that ALL people are flawed (both secular and religious), the world is flawed but the Torah is not. As imperfect as our communities are, the landscape of our surrounding culture and it&#8217;s impact on women, children, families and relationships seemed far more troubling to me. Again, I recognize your right to choose what gives you a sense of meaning in your life. I only ask that you extend the same right and sense of respect to those of us who do find meaning and deep spirituality in our Torah observant life..  </p>

All the laws in regards to Eduth makes it almost impossible for punishment to be done with that system. There was another system set up as mentioned in Sanhedrin that allowed the lock up of individuals when the judges had strong logical reasons to presume their guilt. I am quite fuzzy as to how it worked. It is likely that women&#8217;s testimony were accepted under that sytem. This is just my  off the bat hypothesis and I have no issue with its destruction</p>

It&#8217;s different roles built on millions of years of evolutionary sex differences (of course there will always be exceptions like Devorah but on the aggregate)  and it has no relevance to 2nd class.  And it&#8217;s like that to this day both in Halacha and at lubavitch. </p>

<p>I personally know several New Square Chassidim who did not start out their lives in that sect.  In addition, their leader spends several hours, every weeknight that he is home, accepting visitors and offering them advice, halachic rulings, and blessings &#8211; regardless of the visitor&#8217;s observance level or sect affiliation.</p>

Actually- Orthodox Judaism is completely a &#8220;women&#8217;s rights religion&#8221; as my friends and I used to joke in Stern (yes liberal  STERN college). Women are allowed to be WOMEN without feeling inferior because they are not MEN. Men and Women are not the same! Women are more spiritual, emotional, communicative, nurturing- on a whole. Nashim daisos kallos hein is just that- we don&#8217;t always think with logic- we think with our heart-  or with our &#8220;binah yeseairah&#8221;. How dare you turn that into a BAD thing! How dare you assume that we want to be Rabbis and go to shul three times a day and wear teffilin, or that it is degrading to have our husbands show a rav our underwear (in fact I think it shows how progressive Judaism is). Maybe we WANT to be mothers! Maybe we LIKE the fact that we can be close to G-d without all the extras. Maybe we feel great that our husbands had to &#8220;put a ring on it&#8221;. And maybe we feel good about our role- a lofty one at that. I think that&#8217;s what Chaya was trying to say&#8230;and I think you should get some hadracha.</p>

All I am saying is that TORAH is 100% pro-woman. Maybe there are some individuals pretending to be Torah Observant that are not pro woman. And I think Rabbi Fink is one of them. </p>

<p>Now that I am not religious, I get the option to realize that I am as feminine as I want to be, in my own way.  It is a hell of a healthier attitude to have.  I also realized my ambivalence was much much more common than I thought.</p>

I don&#8217;t think the differences are all that great. The problems are the same; it&#8217;s just a matter of degree.</p>
<p>Even Chabad&#8217;s embrace of Messianism doesn&#8217;t constitute all that great a difference. Other Hasidim see their rebbaim as quasi-divine; the Lubavitchers are just more honest about it.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s true that &#8220;tahor&#8221; means spiritually pure, and the Torah is extremely concerned about purity, you need to be blind to try to pretend that historical taboos about menstruation don&#8217;t exist, or that all the rules about touching and separation don&#8217;t ever contribute to a feeling of &#8220;dirtiness.&#8221; All those pretty spa mikvahs? They were built relatively recently so women would feel better about going. Not all women feel holy and pure about taharat hamishpacha. </p>

I rarely read blogs, but every time I end up here I find myself wondering why I don&#8217;t read every post. Your honesty and objectivity are refreshing.</p>
<p>2) Re all the people saying that women aren&#8217;t second-class citizens: What is a second-class citizen? If women have the right to go to the mikva, but men don&#8217;t (at least not m&#8217;doraisa), are men second-class citizens? I think that if there was a movement of men clamoring for that right, you could legitimately argue that men are second-class. But there is no such group.</p>
<p>There ARE groups of women who would like to lead services in orthodox synagogues. So the moment they ask for this right and they are denied &#8211; although there is no physical reason they cannot do it &#8211; they are second-class citizens. </p>
<p>Perhaps you are happy with your role. That&#8217;s wonderful. Perhaps 75% of orthodox women are satisfied. Perhaps 99% are satisfied. It doesn&#8217;t matter. When a woman complains about the arbitrary limitations placed on her, I cannot disagree.</p>
<p>By the way, how about apply these apologetics to other forms of discrimination? You know, blacks were never second-class in America. Having to sit in the back of the bus was a privilege, to keep them away from hateful whites. And back in slavery days, do you know how lucky these people were, to have the honor of picking cotton on respectable plantations? That&#8217;s much better than becoming a doctor or a lawyer or a plumber!</p>
<p>See, the key to freedom is not that you have the most beautiful lifestyle out there. It&#8217;s that you can do what YOU want. And orthodox women are by no means free.</p>

<p>You may argue that any discussion of citizenship vis-a-vis Judaism is irrelevant. But if there is such a thing, then women are missing a part of it.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-8539" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I would argue that Chabad is the only true Chassidus. When you think about why Chassidus started, it was a new hashkofo of Judaism to combat the challenges of the times. However what I have always found very ironic is that although times have changed, the challenges have changed, Chassidus in many ways is still stuck in 1750 and hasn&#8217;t changed much. And what worked in 18th Century Eastern Europe doesn&#8217;t work so well these days, which I think is part of the reason they&#8217;re faced with issues such as not reporting child molestation, struggling to deal with technology, etc. </p>
<p>Chabad is the exception to the rule here. I think it started with the previous Rebbe ZTL instituting shlichus, changing the dress code somewhat, etc. I don&#8217;t agree with everything they do, but by evolving to face each generation&#8217;s unique challenges, to me they exemplify what Chassidus is supposed to be all about.</p>

<p>But I did. What <b>you</b> don&#8217;t get is that I comment about ideas, not about people. It makes no difference to me that a Litvak stated the point. I am addressing the point, not the person (that&#8217;s also why I don&#8217;t call people names, or at least try VERY hard not to, despite their nastiness sometimes).</p>

<p>ALL the comments are about the post. You know, the post that is above the comment section that we are commenting on!!!!!! This particular thread in the comments was started (?) by Litvak (or maybe someone else, I can&#8217;t see it anymore due to so many comments).</p>

to comment on this </p>
<p>(You see, the insular chasidic sects bear<br />
no resemblance to this world you love. Their world is even more closed and more<br />
insular. So your personal experience, while wonderful, has no relevance to the<br />
world of chasidic women in the insular sects of Satmar, Ger, Vizhnitz, Square,<br />
etc. More importantly, their world is a world where women are more oppressed<br />
than in the rest of orthodox Judaism. There are rules against driving, getting<br />
an education, men and women walk on separate sides of the street in some communities,<br />
there are very strict rules about sex, many women shave their heads, girls are<br />
wed after extremely short meetings to young men they barely know, they must<br />
wear synthetic (bad looking) wigs, can’t wear latest fashions (even the modest<br />
ones), I could go on and on. The point is that in these communities, women<br />
don’t feel the great freedom and empowerment that you feel.)</p>
<p>I live in Boro Park the home of the largest Chasidic<br />
community, and I am a proud member of one of the sects you mention, just want<br />
you to know that while some of what you r writing is true but most of it is not,<br />
let’s just make this clear one by one    “rules against driving” true <br />
 “getting an education” not true there are plenty of therapist’s<br />
graphic designer’s etc…,   “men and women walk on separate “I just don’t know<br />
what you are talking about.  “there are very strict rules about sex” not with your wife,<br />
and that’s how it’s supposed to be.   ” many women shave their heads” true and this is from a תקנה from the וועד ארבע ארצות .     “girls are wed after extremely short<br />
meetings to young men they barely know” , also true but this is only<br />
after the parent’s r making a very thorough investigation and also the short meetings<br />
you r talking about is for a few times and could be for hours and it is proven<br />
very effective there is almost no siddech crises and they r very happily married .   “they must wear synthetic (bad<br />
looking) wigs” what!! I don’t know<br />
where you live but I live in Boro Park the home of most Chassidim and there aren’t<br />
nicer human wigs anywhere else then Boro Park. “can’t wear latest fashions (even the<br />
modest ones)” what!!Again I don’t know where you live<br />
come to Boro Park and will just be proven so wrong </p>

<p>No we cannot agree on that.</p>
<p>1. If Charedism is an ideal way to live, or even a good way to live, or even a correct way to live, it ought to function in Israel and in the USA (the two places with large Charedi populations).<br />
2. American Charedim often send their kids to learn in Israel from Israeli Charedim. And they&#8217;re learning &#8220;The Israeli Charedi lifestyle&#8221;.<br />
3. Some percentage of Charedim in Israel *ARE* former Americans!</p>

<p>I did not and do not assume that.</p>
<p>However, there exist communities of American Charedim that are trying mightily to become more and more like the Israeli Charedim (places like Kiryas Yoel for example).</p>

<p>You repeatedly ignore real-life examples. Kiryas Yoel is attempting to &#8220;live that way&#8221;. &#8220;That way&#8221; being self-imposed poverty and  heavy reliance on public welfare. And, yes, I do lambast self-imposed poverty and heavy reliance on welfare. For various reasons that I&#8217;ve discussed previously.</p>

<p>What on earth are you talking about? There are thriving communities of American Charedim in Israel, and they are trying to &#8220;break into&#8221; Israeli Charedi society with limited success (they are generally perceived as &#8220;too modern&#8221; for full acceptance, but many second generation are slowly being accepted).</p>

2 Yes. Until you mention something of factual evidence it is judt nasty inuendo. Anecdotal evidence leads me to strongly doubt your claims.<br />
3. Again, you miss my point. Their choice to live in Israel (and generally they live in American communities) has little bearing on the nature of Chareidim in America. Their are thriving communities of baalei teshuvah, theri lifestyle also has little reflection on the lifestyle of those who are secular.<br />
You don&#8217;t seem to be that great in understanding my points. please take your time to read my points so I don&#8217;t have to waste time simply restating my original points. Thank you.</p>

if an orthodox woman would put on “pants and go snort coke” she would<br />
probably be asked to leave the community and be handed a quick divorce<br />

 woman put on her pants to go out and snort coke, she&#8217;d also be asked to<br />
 leave, divorced and lose custody of her children.<br />
‎&#8221;There<br />
 are absolutely no social correlations between Chabad and the other<br />
sects of chasidus. None.&#8221; ***Also unfounded and untrue. Just because there<br />
are a lot of baal-teshuva in the Chabad doesn&#8217;t mean the rabbis and<br />
their wives are not part of a larger<br />
Chassidic community that is very much like other Chassidic communities.<br />
Moreover, I&#8217;m friends with the Satmar rebbetzin in our town, and she&#8217;s<br />
just as &#8220;normal&#8221;, independent, involved and a refreshing member of the<br />
community as other women.<br />
No one is stuck. Just like Chaya who was &#8220;stuck&#8221; in the secular world chose the Orthodox world, anyone who wants out of the Orthodox world will find a way to do so. What I hear you saying is, &#8220;What Chaya says may be true for her and most<br />
 Orthodox women, but I&#8217;d like to focus on the ones who are suppressed<br />
because I feel stuck with these Jewish laws and my &#8220;concern&#8221; for suppressed women leads me to then<br />
say without guilt  that therefore the &#8220;laws&#8221; are really not God-made and that supports my not<br />
having to do anything I don&#8217;t want to do. So don&#8217;t do it! You don&#8217;t need to create a negative slant on Orthodox women in order to not observe. </p>

They are both true portrayals of individual viewpoints, nothing more nothing less. Why must either be representative? Every society has people who want to leave, from your standard, American Dream WASP family to Chasidim. Every person who wants to change their life stands to lose by it, no matter what it is they are leaving. U nfortunately, Every society has abuse &#8211; but it is the abuse which frightens and subjugates, not the society. </p>

One small quibble: I found your penultimate paragraph a little less persuasive than the rest of the article because the way it is written, it sounds like it concerns counter-arguments rather than flaws in Chaya&#8217;s argument. </p>
<p>It is a common op-ed trap to say, &#8220;your position based on the &#8216;pro&#8217; arguments AB&amp;C is wrong because you ignore the &#8216;con&#8217; arguments XY&amp;Z.&#8221; But XY&amp;Z don&#8217;t negate AB&amp;C, they are just arguments for an opposing position.  Your earlier paragraphs where you argue that even Chaya&#8217;s arguments supporting the Chasidic lifestyle don&#8217;t apply to the very Chadisic groups she claims to support are much stronger.</p>
<p>Try this instead: &#8220;But the most difficult thing about your article is that it represents apologetics and interpretations of Jewish lifestyle as the standard view on the matter. However, many perceive&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>About this Lubab thing: do you really think knowing she was lubavitch would have been something 99% of their readers would have digested? why didn&#8217;t she<br />
mention she was lubavitch? really? what if she were yekkish from stern?<br />
it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered a rat&#8217;s tuchus to the xojane reader. to be honest, i really think some of the backlash may also stem from our yeshivah community&#8217;s not-so-friendly attitudes toward Chabad. Not cool.</p>
<p>sorry, rabbi fink, your<br />
gemara kop got in the way of your ability to think like an xojane or unbiased<br />
reader. we&#8217;re all lumped together and the media and folks in general have this way of focusing in on the negative. but thanks for the patronizing intro you wrote about how happy you are for HER. </p>
<p>and, when<br />
 was the last time you freaked out at an israel promo video<br />
(latest: israel inside: the big difference israel makes in the world)<br />
when they didn&#8217;t show the real story about how chareidi and chiloni<br />
clash, the shrinking middle class, gov&#8217;t corruption, etc.? but where are you retorting smugly, &#8220;but they<br />
didn&#8217;t represent the whole picture?&#8221; BECAUSE IT&#8217;S A PROMO VIDEO &#8211; NOT AN ANALYSIS OF ISRAELI SOCIETY. The point of this product was to refute a single point in 700 words: we&#8217;re all repressed. method: emphasize some of the good things and positive ways we use our religious life. there are obvious issues &#8211; but that wasn&#8217;t the point of this brief article. Fortunately, you as an orthodox rabbi were able to do that for us&#8230;. cuz, gosh, we had no idea (insert sarcasm), but at least now we have your statement that NO- despite how you live and feel, you actually are repressed, you just didn&#8217;t know it, you trying-to-sell-something, touchy-feely woman.</p>
<p>IT WAS A 700 WORD FIRST-PERSON BLOG POST,<br />
 NOT AN EXPERT ACADEMIC ARTICLE in response to media generalization of<br />
chassidic/orthodox/frum whatever-you call-us women as repressed. that&#8217;s<br />
all, and she did it brilliantly, complying with the style of xojane, NOT<br />
 a drashah, not academic rigour, NOT AN INTERVIEW ON NIGHTLINE OR NPR. </p>
<p>i recognized most of the points you made while reading her blog post &#8211; many people probably did. but she had the opportunity of 700 words to dispel a myth in the venue of xojane with its vast readership. r&#8217; fink, i am disappointed with your article. it was a disservice and missed the point, it was patronizing,<br />
and set us back again as a bickering, divisive people that even when one<br />
 of us goes to bat for the rest of us, we still can&#8217;t leave it alone. next time, try to frame it constructively so when it gets reposted, you don&#8217;t seem like such a holier-than-thou stiff.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed some of your blog posts, but this was just too &#8220;i know more than you &#8211; you shouldn&#8217;t have spoken up&#8221; &#8211; Not cool.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how I see it. She writes a nice article about her own experiences. You applaud her for her personal success but admonish her for speaking on behalf of chasidic womankind.   Clearly she&#8217;s the exception, what with being educated and all. I fail to see how anyone can dispute this.</p>
<p>Now as far as the larger debate&#8230;if you&#8217;re a happy chassidic woman great, enjoy your life. But what if you&#8217;re not? Is there an outlet? For education? For culture? For questioning? For perspective? Sadly there isn&#8217;t. You are stuck.</p>
<p>I send my 4 daughters to yeshiva and hope they follow in the ways of their family and lead Torah observant lives. They may choose not to. They have their own minds. That&#8217;s the difference. Chassidic women are for the most part stuck, anonymous, second class citizens with no voice. Sad.</p>

But is anyone in the world stopping me from having my good times that I do? No one can stop me from my NYC jaunts, biking, running marathons, manicures&#8230;because I can do it! There is nothing inherently wrong with it and don&#8217;t give a flip about what other people say. Is there things I wont do that I would like to but is a &#8220;rule&#8221; in my kids school, possibly, but rules are rules, and if you do break them please be take responsibility when the concenquenses arrive (and dont blame religion for your dumb acts) C&#8217;mon none of you adults worked and had a boss that made rules?! Every chassidish woman in Williamsburg can have her type of fun. Now if her type of fun is sleeping around, ok cant help her.

In the sense of extremity; Is eugenics a blessing? How about Nazism? Racism? Communism? I choose to respect individuals regardless of their viewpoints, but why should I differentiate Reform from Christianity. They both believe in the Divine Nature of the torah (possibly Christains more so) and believe that traditional Judaism does not apply anymore. Of course Christains, Muslim and Reform communities do great things, but there is no reason I should accept them as correct religious or philosophical viewpoints.</p>

<p> I disagree. Every single frum Jew, whether FFB or BT, makes the choice to be frum, to remain frum, every single day. This especially applies today when the temptation (and the ease) of becoming secular is so pervasive. Sure the choice is easier for an FFB, whether due to momentum, education, faith, or a combination of the three, but still it&#8217;s a choice. It&#8217;s always a choice.</p>

You want to rant about something and the injustices of society, then go complain about the fact that the secular Western world has no value for anything besides for sex. Go write lengthy articles about the fact that more and more young girls are become pregnant in their early teens and that society no longer values a defined family structure.</p>

That being said although Freud might agree with Jane and apply that to religious jews as well, I believe her characterization is wrong. There is a growing sexification in American culture, but I think it is dishonest to say that their only value is sex.</p>

in regard to women not being recognized in halacha as suitable witnesses, countable members of a minyan, etc&#8230;.this is only because they do NOT have a chiyuv&#8230;in halacha there is a concept that a person who has no chiyuv (obligation) for something cannot be moztie (fulfill) someone else&#8217;s. That is a little misleading. Otherwise everything else that is embraced by these chassidic sects is generally unfounded, though they claim to embrace the beliefs of authentic and historical Judaic texts and authors.  </p>

When it comes down to it, we only know what&#8217;s going on in our own communities, if that. We are all entitled to our own opinions; we shouldn&#8217;t assume that we have it all figured out and anybody who associates his/herself with a different hashkafa is mistaken and suffering. There are both happy and unhappy people in EVERY type of community and household. The bottom line is, we should all be more open-minded and accepting. We should all agree to disagree and give everybody the benefit of the doubt instead of wasting our time arguing about it. I think this is one thing we can all agree on 🙂</p>

When they speak of Chassidus, they speak of Chabad, period. So it is natural for the author to think of her own experience as that of all Chassidic women. I&#8217;m happy for her that she&#8217;s been so fortunate, but there are women even within Chabad who haven&#8217;t been as lucky, and who might make different choices if they had a chance to live their lives over again. And other Chassidic groups are by no means identical with each other, either. They do tend to be highly structured and gender roles are strictly defined, but the particular extrahalachic rules differ from group to group. Also, perhaps some women find it easier to live within strict guidelines if they were raised within such a system rather than having come from the relative freedom of the outside world. (&#8220;Relative&#8221;, because don&#8217;t most cultures have certain expectations of the people who live in them?) Some ba&#8217;alei teshuvah stretch themselves to a certain level trying to conform, and then snap back. When it comes to human beings, there&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all. We as Jews believe the Torah was specifically prescribed for us by G-d, but there are many ways to live a Torah observant life, baruch Hashem.</p>

&#8220;The point is that in these communities, women don’t feel the great freedom and empowerment that you feel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fink presumes to know how all the women in Chassidic communities feel. Wow. Just wow. Can you say hubris? Or as we say in the Hayseedic world, gaivah?</p>
<p>Not only that, in that one comment, he unabashedly identifies with &#8220;freedom and empowerment&#8221;, empowerment being one of the hottest liberal buzzwords of the last 20 years. It&#8217;s a sly way of saying, &#8220;we want to call the shots without being called &#8220;uppity&#8221;. So, the hell with halacha, the hell with mesorah, the hell with minhag, the hell with your family&#8217;s feelings and the effects on your children, we gonna&#8217; get empowered. Is that it, Fink? &#8220;Empowerment&#8221; is the new Jewish nirvana, the salvation of the oppressed Jewish Women.</p>
<p>How one calling himself a &#8220;Rabbi&#8221; (and G-d help the souls of his congregants) can so brazenly and insultingly describe Orthodox Yiddishkeit as an unrelenting tool of oppression of women is just astonishing. Medieval dress codes, underwear inspections, no Talmud study and no contraception! OMG! What are we going to do? You&#8217;re right Fink, they should cast their iron bras into the furnace, study at the Mir, pop the pill, go commando and let it all hang out! After all, Orthodoxy is just so oppressive and there&#8217;s all that freedom and empowerment out there just for the taking. Then, like their non-religious counterparts, they can enjoy all the happiness that women&#8217;s lib has bestowed upon the last 2 and a half generations of childless, lonely, bitter, disillusioned, free and empowered feminists. </p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t know where this Ms. Kurtz had the gumption to proclaim that an Orthodox woman can be perfectly happy with all the Orthodox oppression of womyn going on. Fink&#8217;s new slogan: &#8220;The Torah: Mend it, Don&#8217;t End it&#8221;. Subtitle: &#8220;We&#8217;ll teach those old rabbis a thing or two.&#8221; What a joke.</p>

Ask any agunah on this planet how free she is, and then ask any rabbi if he would do anything to free her. The answer is that since Rabbi Rackman died, and since Rabbi Soleveitchik tried to destroy him, and since the Agudah went against Reb Moishe Feinstein&#8217;s attempt to write the giving of a get as a condition of a civil divorce decree in the early 1970s, there is not a single rabbi who will free a woman&#8230;the best will tell you to get the special prenup. period. No pre-nup, no freedom, unless you are willing to be released by handing over everything, including the kids, plus thousands upon thousands and even millions of dollars. Nice of the rabbi and the Chabadnitchke to forget about them. And you wonder why they fall off the derech? Please. This goes up there with the child abuse and sex abuse. Go to the Kings County clerks office and see if you can dig up some files.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-8660" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Although I liked the article, some points are overstated, women in orthodox judaism are limited as to minyanim, beis din, and davening, but there are reasons for this that cannot be seen through the prism of American Feminism and secular values. Due to the pervasive nature of chumra in ultra orthodox communities, they have taken some of these separations, limitations, and halachic rulings to the level of its own religion.  Being born into these communities certainly makes it difficult to leave and people can feel trapped.  The pressures are very intense and cannot be compared to someone who chooses to be orthodox, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that these women in ultra orthodox communities are completely without recourse.  We cannot perpetuate an idea that this is the norm in these communities and there is no way out, these issues of discrimination don&#8217;t stem from not being able to have their own torah readings or being able to wear short skirts.  By and large the statistics in the broader orthodox community are positive in terms of more happy marriages, lower divorce rates, and other metrics in the OU&#8217;s recent survey.  While Chaya has understated the issue experienced in Satmar or more insular Chasidic communities, making a case that this is a result of a lack of female religious expression or dress code is not completely accurate as well.  But the biggest and most important contribution by this article to the discussion is that the experience of a chabad baal teshuva is very far removed from that of a girl growing up in Williamsburg, and unfortunately, baalei teshuva (me being one as well) underestimate this tremendously and its correct to call her out on it.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-8661" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>In my humble opinion, you both are generalizing too much. I am A chasidishe woman, who lives in Monsey, and my husand, who is a third generation Viznitzer, decided that he did want the average &#8220;forfrimteh&#8221; woman, and so he married a Lubavitcher, who was interested in entering the Ultra Frum world. You most know that you are both correct and truth be told, that in Chaya&#8217;s world things work that way, but not for everyone, and in the Ultra Chassidishe world it SOMETIMES works that way, and yet only the fanatics do as you say, in regards to the bedroom, clothes and forcing marriage on the teens. Times are definitely changing, in some places. The kallah teachers are now more open minded and actually are telling the girls more &#8220;up to date&#8221; details about sex than they used to. The clothes, if you&#8217;ll excuse me, is also something that&#8217;s a bit exaggerated, my Satmar friends spend loads on brand name clothes and they look really good. Only the older fanatics are still wearing all black or all dark colors. In regards to the education, my girls go to Viznitz and my 10th grader is learning biology, history, math and English, all on the level of the NY state curriculum. No about contraception, the Rebbe himself gave permission to his own granchildren to take birth control, and I have many friends that either have an IUD or have had their tubes tide, because they couldn&#8217;t handle having anymore.  Again, times are changing, and though there still remains many ultra frum fanatics in the world who still feel its OK to shove Yiddishkiet down their kid&#8217;s throats, they are still the minority, and there are now task forces in place, in the New Square, Satmar, Viznitz and many other communities who are starting to buckle down and stop the abuse that has destroyed generations. But in retrospect, aside from the fact that, out of pure lack of knowledge and fear, the Rabbanim have been going overboard when it comes to actually accepting people  for who the WANT to be, if they are not going on the Ultra path, but that too is changing, and will continue to change. I will end off by saying that in all honesty, being Chassidish shouldn&#8217;t be a jail sentence, and most people will agree that it is NOT one, and if you are unlucky enough to be born into a family who thinks that if you look at something bad, you&#8217;re a goy, or if you speak your own thoughts, you&#8217;re a sheigetz, then remember that there is nothing wrong with it, and you don&#8217;t have to go completely &#8220;OTD&#8221; because of it. Remember, as well, that in most homes, women or the foundation, we are the necks to the heads, and where the neck turns the head goes. Men have more mitzvahs, good for them, but we run the house, with pleasure, and what we say matters, and if we want something, they have to give it to us. If you want to change something in the world, start with the &#8220;man/woman in the mirror&#8221;.</p>

<p>Oppressed_and_HopefulDear writer;Your article is extremely misleading, to put it mildly.I’m not sure what your definition of CHASSIDIC is, you may be referring to some modern “CHASSIDIM”, but you surly don’t refer to my Hassidic world.I’m talking about the Yiddish-Speaking Hassidic community; which is almost all of Orthodox Jewish Williamsburg and the vast majority of Boro Park.That&#8217;s the community I was born into, and that&#8217;s the live I live !And OH!, How wrong you are!!!It’s hard to write, but sometimes it’s harder, to move on and let the misleading and the lying go on….With all the respect; you don’t’ know my community.You have no idea how different our lives is compared to yours. <br />
You can have a hundred Hassidic friends, and still not have an understanding of the true nature of our radicle lifestyle.Yes, you write that your husband has a beard a Kippah. I believe you, but so do thousands of normal, educated, spiritual orthodox Jews which were fortunate not to be born into my community.In our community; the odds of a woman having a &#8220;degree from a large liberal university&#8221; is almost non-existent. You may find a few, but that’s the exception, not the norm. The boys graduate with no high school diploma. The girls –in some schools – graduate with a diploma, in some schools they don’t.<br />
Going to college is something that most women won’t even think of.Right after school we get married. Right after marriage we start the Baby Making procedure.With such a life there are very few woman that have the strength to pursue and end with a college degree. The one that do it, will graduate with degrees in Special Education or similar. And –just to set the record straight- not from a major university; it will usually be from local colleges that cater to our “special needs”.1) We are not imprisonedMaybe you are not, but in our community Men and Women are!If you decide to put on pants, or the word gets out that you are visiting bars of any kind; you lose your social life!<br />
You will be looked down at, your kids will be expelled from Yeshiva, your siblings will shun you, your best friends will disappear from your life, your kids will have a problem marrying in the community, you will be labeled as a lowlife ETC.Now; do you call that FREE?The slightest deviation from the path will make you regret it. There is ZERO tolerance to any individualism.You don’t CHOSE anything; you are just born into a community and you are brainwashed into believing that you actually have choices. But if you discover humanity one day, you are in for a painful life. The price of leaving is just too high, so we stay and keep it all inside.2) We like ourselves the way we are. And most of us are happyIt’s not easy to discuss ones “happiness”, but I will raise a few points.How dare you blame Devoree Feldman&#8217;s experience on her &#8220;dysfunctional family&#8221; and her &#8220;crummy school&#8221;? Did you even read her book? <br />
I read her book cover to cover and I found everything to be the truth. Believe me that she wrote only the nice parts.What you write about her is our typical defense system. We are so brainwashed that we truly believe it. <br />
When someone has the courage to lose their entire social and cultural life because they feel they feel miserable in our lifestyle, we will always find something to pin it on; their mental stability, dysfunctional upbringing or whatever it takes…Never ever will we say “That person made a choice and we are respecting it”. <br />
No! It can’t work like this; because –if we show any understanding towards those that leave- thousands would do what Feldman did. <br />
The way we keep the masses in line is a combination of <br />
•Labeling the ones that leave as mentally-retarded, clinically-depressed etc.<br />
•constant brainwash about a God that has punishment procedures that makes Hitler look like a mild hearted grandpa<br />
•Knowing that you will be shunned and lose your friends and family if you dare leave<br />
•Lack of education; without a career of any kind it’s very difficult to start over all alone<br />
•Isolation &amp; extremism; when one has zero knowledge about movies, sports, history, politics , music , arts and everything else today’s world offers, it hard to impossible to leave the community.<br />
And more ….Most women in our community; <br />
• have much more kids than they can handle, due to peer pressure<br />
• have very little to non, leisure activities, <br />
• are brainwashed into thinking that that’s how life must be if you don’t wanna end up in hell<br />
• lack the basic knowledge of intimacy and sex (some will catch up but it take years, others will never know what a O is) <br />
• Are so busy with taking care of the home and kids that they have no time to stop , think and look around!<br />
• Don’t drive due to social pressure<br />
• Don’t watch movies, sport games, show ETC. <br />
• Will follow the very strict rules about what clothes to wear, even if they don’t feel like, because of the social pressure. <br />
• Have very primitive knowledge of the “Jewish Religion”! that may be a bit complicated to explain here, but it’s a sad fact <br />
I can go on and on …To call this a “spiritual life” is unfair. <br />
It’s brainwashing; it’s mental &amp; emotional conditioning.4)We find our husbands attractive.This is not a simple subject, but I will voice the painful truth in short.You write that your husband has an impressive bead. Good for you! <br />
In my community, if one decides to trim his beard, the backlash will be so harsh that most will rather let it grow –even though we are disgusted by its untrimmed wild borders. It’s not funny! , trimming your beard will get you such negative.Should I go on and start talking about the huge percentage of men that totally ignore the personal hygiene? And it’s all part of the brainwashing that we “don’t invest too much in the materialistic body”. <br />
Yes, the easiest way out is to label anyone mentioning the above as an anti-Semite and keep pretending that it’s all fine.Do you think that there is open communication about intimacy and sexuality? <br />
The women are taught not to discuss those subjects with anyone but a rabbinical authority.And if a woman does not find her husband attractive, does she have a choice? <br />
Anyway; since when is one allowed to discuss “attractiveness”, what does that even mean?I can tell you with certainty that most woman or men in our community have NEVER felt what it means to be in LOVE. If you want to understand what I mean, I suggest you watch/listen to a song in Fiddler on the Roof. The song is: “Do you Love me?” The song says it all. That’s the reality we live in.5) You write: <br />
Fun fact: Jewish law prohibits marrying someone who you&#8217;re not attracted toYes, Jewish law writes lots of things. And that’s what I’m pointing out; our life has very little to do with Jewish law!Do you know how marriages are done in my community? <br />
You obviously don’t, because talking about “attractiveness” is not even good for a bad joke.Most of us will meet once or twice before we get engaged. That meeting takes place, in our parent’s house or -if you are lucky- in a closed hotel room and it usually lasts from half-hour to an hour . <br />
And don’t forget that this is the FIRST TIME that we attempt to create some kind of connection with a member the opposite gender.6) I would continue; but it became late and I must go now.So I will finish with a <br />
A suggestion to the writer :No one in the media is bashing “Orthodox Jews”.You may take the time to learn about an extreme community that originated from the Jewish Religion. The sad fact is that most of the things that I read in the media is the truth.And yes; we – the brainwashed, radicle, uneducated Hassidim – were at least 50% of the participants at this “Internet Meeting” that you are so proud of.You may want to learn about our suppressed lives; maybe one day you can help someone discover the spirituality in Judaism. <br />
Reading Devorah Feldman’s book may be a good start.And a message to the readers:Next time you see a Hassidic woman pushing a double-carriage in Williamsburg, I hope you won’t look at her as being a depressed woman.Rest assure that she is so brainwashed that she doesn’t realize how her life is controlled and how all decisions in her life are made for her by others.Actually they probably pity YOU, that you never experienced the joy of having tons of kids and being so busy with taking care of the kids and the house that it DOES NOT LEAVE YOU TIME or energy to realize the human needs of individualism, freedom, self-discovery and …Oh and one more point if you feel that she looks at you like you don’t “belong”, don’t take it personal.<br />
We are trained from our childhood to keep a distance (not just physically) from any human that is not part of our community. <br />
Nothing personal here. <br />
That’s just what we need to do to “protect ourselves and our kids” from the filth and the immorality that the entire world –but us- lives in today’s era.Oh and next time that you see a Hassidic man … (I better stop now)There is much more to say.<br />
If you have any questions or comments, send them to me.<br />
If you want to have a public discussion, even a debate, let me know.<br />
If you just want to have an argument –about any issue- please consider me. <br />
If you don’t care about anything on this planet: I don’t know what to tell you, but I really identify with you!<br />
If you have parents or kids and you love them; say it to them!Last but not least; <br />
If –when asked to participate in a debate &#8211; you must know beforehand which opinion you are defending, you probably don’t know enough about the issue.Have you really read everything till here? <br />
To be honest, I’m surprised and I thank you for reading it.yup, that&#8217;s me <br />

<p> I just wanted to address the topic of women being spiritually elevated answer to why they are not &#8220;encumbered&#8221; with certain mitzvot that in turn exclude them from certain communal roles (i.e. leading services)     </p>
<p> I ask those who subscribe to the elevated spirituality of women theory:  If women<br />
 are so spiritually gifted  then why wouldn&#8217;t you want the spiritually gifted to be your<br />
spiritual leaders (i.e. rabbis), learn and teach all facets of Torah,<br />
offer halachic guidance, and even lead the congregational prayer with<br />
their higher spiritual connection.  After all, isn&#8217;t finding someone who<br />
 is spiritually elevated, closer to G-d if you will, one of the<br />
qualifications one should seek in a chazzan?I think in the debate over women&#8217;s role in OJ, it might be more effective to first bypass the issues where there&#8217;s a &#8220;perception&#8221; of inequality (rabbi, cantor, minyan) and highlight the areas where the &#8220;It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me&#8221; (as in it&#8217;s the man&#8217;s spiritual deficiency ) excuse doesn&#8217;t work.  e.g. I think the inability of women to be a witness for Jewish legal purposes and the prohibition of Talmud study as you have already mentioned are good ones.   Add to that divorce which is a one way street in which only the man can grant it to the woman leaving the women and her estranged husband&#8217;s mercy and the terrible pain abuses to that halacha cause.   There&#8217;s no perception issue there, the inequality is blantant, and it gives a woman 2nd class standing in halachic divorce proceedings.   Furthermore, in<br />
 Parshat Ki Teitzei, if a man rapes a virgin, he pays 50 silver shekalim<br />
 to the girls father, and then marries her for life. Later in the<br />
parsha, if a woman attempts to save her husband in a fight by grabbing<br />
the assailants private parts, we cut off her hand. (Even if we don&#8217;t<br />
interpret this literally, what does the difference in approach between a<br />
 man sexually assaulting a women, vs a woman sexually assaulting a man,<br />
even with cause, tell you?)   Again, the inequality is apparent and objective not subject to dispute over who is given the upper hand in the matter.   </p>

Well of course they do. They are judging orthodox standards by western progressive thought. So I guess her original piece was sort of a &#8220;gloves come off&#8221; reaction. I think she would have made a better point if she left out chassidut and just talked about orthodoxy in general.</p>
<p>Rabbi I was wondering about your opinion on something Abandoning Eden said:</p>
<p>&#8220;And my role as a wife (and I&#8217;m not a mother yet- also because of my career) is secondary to my role as a sociology professor.&#8221;</p>
<p>In my opinion, I have always felt this is where feminism failed. They simply taught women this. For myself, I have and still do feel like being a husband is a my primary role. My career is my career. It can always change, but it&#8217;s never primary over to my obligation to the person I have decided to be with and build a home with. Do you agree with what she said? And if you don&#8217;t, do you mind giving your opinion on where that hashkafa comes from? I&#8217;m not asking to zing you. Even though I may disagree with you at times, I still appreciate your analysis.</p>

We may choose (be it a choice made easy or difficult by different circumstances, by your own example being asked to leave the community, given a quick divorce, and losing custody of one&#8217;s children) to keep its laws or throw them to the wayside. Sometimes we make the right choices and sometimes we don&#8217;t. There are always choices. If a loaded gun was put to your head and you were told to hand over everything you have or be shot there is still choice. Granted, a choice between &#8220;bad&#8221; and &#8220;really bad&#8221;, but still a choice. Going back to the perception or feeling like a second class citizen: so what? So sometimes a woman, or a man for that matter, may feel shortchanged or like they&#8217;re not as important as someone else. To that I answer, so what? Get a grip. I don&#8217;t appreciate this write up. I don&#8217;t appreciate the constant &#8220;stabbing&#8221; and &#8220;knocking down&#8221; of one fellow Jew to the other. We have enough people who hate us for no other reason than our bloodlines. We don&#8217;t need to hate ourselves for those same bloodlines. I am a proud Jewish woman. and yes, some of the commandments are hard to do. Many I don&#8217;t do perfectly (far from it), but to sit here and badmouth the Torah that you will be re-given in just a few days I don&#8217;t understand. I don&#8217;t understand the point (maybe by doing so you feel you will gain some points&#8230;). You want to spread a love of Torah please do so, but not in this way. All this does is spread hate, misunderstanding, and gross misconceptions.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-8692" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>As a modern Orthodox Jewish woman I can see many points in this article.  It is true that in some communities Women are limited.  My main objection is that this is not true for the entirety of Torah Observant Judaism!  We need to ensure that the world is not ignorant to how the majority of Jewish women actually live.</p>
<p>There are many Orthodox (just not Chasiddik) communities where women learn the Talmud and teach both men and women about the Torah and Halachah just like Deborah in the Navi.  We are able to wear current (although modest) fashion, drive (seriously, how else can I shop in the suburbs), vote, get a higher education, have careers as lawyers, doctors, executives, CEOs and etc.  For me family purity is a responsibility that is an honor to uphold.  We also need to respect the privacy of this matter.  How many women go to a male doctor because he is particularly the best around?   There are stronger privacy laws than HIPA in regards to that matter of observant life because it is a private matter for each family.  You have to choose a Rabbi (Kenai L&#8217;Chah Rav) that is sensitive enough to be discreet about the whole thing. Personally, I grew up FFB (Frum -or Orthadox- from birth) and I still choose to remain as observant as I possibly can.  We all struggle with the personal choices of following Torah Judaism every day &#8211; and so do many men.  It really is a question of our free will, something that G-D gave every human being.I enjoyed reading Chaya&#8217;s article and fully  admire her decision to become observant.  She allowed me to remember that respecting people&#8217;s individuality is important.  Kudos</p>

The same opportunities you&#8217;ve had to receive an &#8220;education&#8221; and have used to belittle your fellow Jews so as to possibly appeal to the secular world and secular Jewry?!!? I&#8217;ve seen people successful in kiruv without resorting to belittling and defaming the Orthodox and the Torah life they follow. This is hypocrisy at it&#8217;s best. How can you really teach someone to love a Torah that you obviously don&#8217;t fully love and appreciate?!!? What exactly is your approach? Hey, come learn Torah with me. A Torah that seats women &#8220;in the back of the bus&#8221;, is stuck in yesteryear&#8217;s fads and traditions, and has no bearing on your life in 2012. Great tag line. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll get plenty of neshamos (souls) sparked that way.</p>

He is helping you through your &#8216;second class citizen&#8217; status by putting it out there in writing! He feels your pain.

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-8737" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is one of the most ignorant and irresponsible things I&#8217;ve ever heard a Rabbi say.  The distaste this man is putting forth because of her background is unjustified and ignorant, just like his lower-case Os and inability to use the proper comparative.  <br />
Disagree with Chaya Kurtz on the merit of her arguments, not because of where she&#8217;s coming from.  Stay on task and you won&#8217;t get this sort of reaction.  Maybe you wanted this reaction because it generates traffic.  I don&#8217;t know.   This woman&#8217;s background as a Chabadnik is actually irrelevant.  Hordes of Baalei T&#8217;shuva have this positive attitude toward their experience.  Her affiliation is irrelevant and doesn&#8217;t undermine her writing.  That&#8217;s just on one point.  Secondly, the fact she is a baal t&#8217;shuva is also not a disqualifying factor in her opinion.</p>
<p>This article, just like Deborah Feldman&#8217;s, is inappropriately patronizing.  As if her baalat t&#8217;shuva status automatically makes her a figure much less qualified to have an opinion.  Baalei t&#8217;shuva live under similar circumstances as do converts.  Their opinions are just as legitimate, and to ever dismiss what they say because of their status as converts is categorically prohibited in Jewish Law.  Whether or not the law applies to baalei t&#8217;shuva in the same way, the attitude the Torah demands of established Jews toward converts applies here, because much of the spirit of those laws is to not disdain the newcomer to the community merely on the basis of that person&#8217;s nouveau life as an observant Jew.</p>
<p>Rabbi Fink, if there were a board that sanctioned Rabbis for their conduct, I&#8217;d make an appeal to it.  This is the sort of thing over which politicians resign.  I might have expected this sort of casual approach to someone&#8217;s serious appeal from someone  like Deborah Feldman, who doesn&#8217;t have a title behind her name to maintain, but from you I would have expected so much more caution.</p>
<p>This article does a much larger disservice to the women AND men who call themselves baalei t&#8217;shuva.  What possessed you to write this way is beyond me.  Whatever your political opinions, the Referee demands more care with your words, lest your words lead your students to bitter waters.<br />
Then again, my opinion probably doesn&#8217;t matter as much as yours, because I&#8217;m not an FFB and even more because I had to convert to compensate for my Mother&#8217;s non-Jewish background.  Apparently, that combo leaves me out in the cold.  I can talk about convert stuff, but draw a red line for me if I want to talk about women, gays, or whatever else.  Let the grown-ups run the house and I&#8217;ll go play in the corner?  This is a despicable attitude I&#8217;m seeing here, and I can&#8217;t write enough about it.</p>

Any orthodox woman who is questioning her role in life and is feeling like a second class citizen should question it until she finds satisfying answers. Many chassidic women are happy and you know what? they are brought up in that lifestyle and don&#8217;t know differently. To them on the inside it&#8217;s normal. I think to project on what is not known to you first hand is WRONG. And one persons experience does not reflect on the entire community. Orthodox women ARE TOO allowed to learn Talmud if it is their wish but it is not necessary for them too, it does not help them in their every day lives to be better people and they do not have the mitzvah of learning so that is why they don&#8217;t. You say women don&#8217;t hold important positions in the religious world? Bruriah the wife of Rebbe Meir held one. Women are the back bone of men. Without women men would not be able to achieve half of what they do. In the Garden of Eden when God said man should not be alone, He created a WOMAN. We have power and should live up to what we can do. We do not need to have prestigious positions in society to be able to go far. It&#8217;s all about perspective. Honestly, if you look around, in the secular world the women are so much more exploited than in the religious orthodox world. Open your eyes</p>

<p>You dispute her first, excellent point that we are not imprisoned. What your ranting ignores is that all societies incur social consequences for behavior, including secular societies that have nothing to do with Judaism. That does not limit personal freedom, it is simply a component of choice. There is nothing wrong with this. Rather, it is one definitive element of what a society is, i.e. a body that responds to the choices of the individual.</p>
<p>Secondly, your &#8220;incontrovertible facts&#8221; about halacha vis-a-vis women represent the most superficial, thoughtless spooning that those with an elementary-school level Jewish education like to spew about a body of religious, social, psychological, and spiritual thought that has been rigorously developed over the course of millennia. Grow up and stop writing about so-called religious womens issues like a seventh grader. I challenge any woman or man who would rally to your cause to have the integrity to spend several years in yeshiva first. (Knowing that you have already done so makes your misleading stances all the more disturbing.)</p>
<p>I am sorry to use such harsh words, but your own words are so offensive that they demand response in kind. Were you aware that you present women like me as anything but free agents? That you present women like me as idiots who are pleased to be relegated to a second-class status? Surely you jest. My life experience (and I joined the Charedi world at twelve, thank you) attests that Chaya spoke very well for the vast majority of Chassidic and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish women.</p>

How ridiculous!!!!  When we need her to assume a man&#8217;s role and bring home a living we send her out into a public domain and have her speak and lead then we turn around and tell her when she gets home she needs to be quiet and not open her mouth in mixed company because that would be a lack of tznius&#8230;<br />
I only hope we don&#8217;t see more and more frum girls leaving yiddishkeit because of this hypocrisy.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-8780" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi Rabbi Fink,<br />
As a young Chassidishe woman living in Williamsburg and a Satmar graduate I feel that I qualify to respond to some things in your article. <br />
I don&#8217;t think your article was so off base but some details were not accurate. <br />
I do agree that it seems that Hasidic or rather Orthodox women are second class citizens but I think most women themselves do not feel this way.  I cannot argue the fact that some things in Judaism do give credibility to this notion but I am not really looking to go into that. It is too complicated. <br />
I actually just wanted to refute the statements specifically about the rules for women.<br />
You mentioned the medieval dress code for women. Usually when someone asks me about that I tell them to look at the men&#8217;s garb first. The women&#8217;s dress code is pretty liberal compared to theirs. Women can and do look fashionable in many hasidic communities. I know there are many women who don&#8217;t and I am not exactly sure if they choose it or if it is a direct result of their upbringing. All I know is that I live in Williamsburg and I am very fashion minded and I do not have a problem looking beautiful and trendy (in a modest manner). <br />
Some hasidic communities are stricter and more insular than others and some families are stricter and more insular than others. I think a lot depends on that.<br />
In my family we do not wear ugly synthetic wigs, we dress fashionably, we enjoy a good movie here or there and watch tv shows that are not dirty or obscene (The shark tank, The biggest loser, just to name a few) and we get to choose who to marry, meaning our dates are arranged but not our marriage. (And most of us I believe have a great fulfilling s-xual marriage).</p>
<p>Also contrary to what most people believe, many women take birth control and it is becoming more widespread and accepted. We do not necessarily believe in family planning (I only want to have 2 kids) but we do believe in birth control (I am overwhelmed and need a break right now). I take breaks between my kids as my husband and I see fit as to what works for us. <br />
I also want to say that it is becoming more widespread for men and women -after marriage- (note I didn&#8217;t write boys and girls) to go for a degree. It is not so popular yet but it is not taboo anymore and that in itself is a step towards the right direction.  I agree that education needs a revamp  in our community. <br />
About driving, there are many communities where hasidic women drive. (Orthodox not hasidic women do not have this rule). You will see many hasidic women drive in Monsey, and Boro Park and other places outside of insular communities like mine or Kiryas Joes or New Square. I am not happy with this rule but I can move away. I think the rule is ridiculous just like you do. I went ahead and got my driver&#8217;s license. I didn&#8217;t think there was a reason for me not to. </p>
<p>I want to say lots more but I have to run to work :-). I guess I just wanted to point out that many of us do have options if we don&#8217;t exactly fit in. For some it is harder to follow their dreams and for some easier, but for most of the women who want to leave or step out of the accepted cookie cutter frame I believe they can do so. </p>
<p>If anybody has any questions I hope to answer after I get home from work (It&#8217;s Erev Shavous too so it&#8217;s a hectic time). I hope you can realize that I have written this article in a friendly tone and with respect (as the tone is hard to get across the intenet). <br />
Hope you all have a great day!</p>
<p>Sara</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The men in the Charedi world also have far fewer choice in many matters than necessary. It&#8217;s sad that a Charedi young man who may have an aptitude for math and science is strongly discouraged from going to college and to graduate school to study and become an expert in a field. Instead he in only encouraged to sit in the beis medrash as long as possible, get married at some point, and eventually end up working in a &#8220;job&#8221; rather than have a &#8220;career&#8221; where he might have a chance to bring some great good to the world. The men are all encouraged to dress the same, behave the same, etc. That is also wrong IMO.</p>

<p>I read this blog all the time and find<br />
it incredibly insightful and true, so I mean no disrespect when I say that I<br />
disagree with this post. Due to my field of work, I read a lot of news and<br />
women&#8217;s blogs ( Gawker, Jezebel and XO Jane included) and also have many<br />
non-Jewish and non-religious friends whose opinions I’ve gauged on these<br />
topics. I feel that this article must be understood in the context of where it<br />
was published and towards whom it was directed. It’s not like this was put<br />
forth by the Jewish Press to address Flatbush and Boro Park, am I right? I<br />
probably fall into the minority of frum girls who are quite familiar with the<br />
content of XO Jane and Jezebel and because of this, I feel this article is such<br />
a boon to this type of media. Instead of belittling Chaya&#8217;s viewpoint for being<br />
marginal and out of touch with the feelings and ordeals of all the frum women in<br />
the world, it should be praised for promoting the positive values that we enjoy<br />
and defending us against the erroneous stereotypes that abound on these types<br />
of blogs. The positive things that Chaya mentions are objective I might add. If<br />
there are problems within our communities where these values are perverted and misconstrued,<br />
that&#8217;s a different issue and not the point of Chaya&#8217;s article. Sites like XO<br />
Jane often discus sexuality and relationships from such dysfunctional<br />
standpoints that you can’t help wonder how these college educated and<br />
intelligent women allow themselves to be treated, yes, like second class<br />
citizens, by the men they date. The sexual expectations women in the secular<br />
dating world are subject to are so degrading. And it’s totally normal by the<br />
way. What was once considered deviant or fetish behavior is totally standard,<br />
and if a girl doesn’t think its right or doesn’t want to do it, she’s labeled a<br />
“prude” and her dating value plummets in her social circle.</p>
<p> <br />
No wonder Chaya, who is a women’s studies major, appreciates the<br />
constructive values and respect that is due to a woman in Judaism. She’s not<br />
trying to say all is good and amazing in our communities when it isn’t. What she<br />
is doing is saying that keeping Hashem’s mitzvos (and I’m not talking about<br />
erroneous community standards etc.) does not make you an oppressed and<br />
misguided woman, and in fact can do more towards making you a functional and<br />
happy human being then playing the field. I was personally inspired by her<br />
article and was glad that someone finally used that platform to address people<br />
who write negative things about people like me out of ignorance.</p>

And so when balancing the two, the future of orthodox Judaism and the internal issues that we MUST deal with are supreme. That is why I wrote this article. I don&#8217;t believe PR for hip orthodox Jews is an especially meaningful or valuable pursuit. If we fix our problems WE WON&#8217;T NEED PR.</p>

If society theoretically had an incorrect view as opposed to Judaism, would Judaism not require PR? Your comment seems to imply that there is no viewpoint in the secular world that is at odds with Judaism. Right or wrong you are just an apologist.</p>

<p> אֶל-הָאִשָּׁה אָמַר, הַרְבָּה אַרְבֶּה עִצְּבוֹנֵךְ<br />
וְהֵרֹנֵךְ&#8211;בְּעֶצֶב, תֵּלְדִי בָנִים; וְאֶל-אִישֵׁךְ, תְּשׁוּקָתֵךְ,<br />

&#8220;Unto the woman He said: &#8216;I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy<br />
travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall<br />

 <br />
There you have it, the Torah&#8217;s declares the role of women to be in a  subservient position to men.    A critical review of the Torah further supports this, be it a husband&#8217;s power to annul his wife&#8217;s vows, marital property laws, control over divorce, etc.   Looking at the examples, clearly this isn&#8217;t one of those verses in Genesis that was meant allegorically.</p>
<p>That verse and subsequent laws of the Torah have set the tone for the millenia of rabbinic thought that followed until the past couple of centuries.   Sure you might find sources (Rashi) to tell you that&#8217;s not how it&#8217;s understood, and others who will remind us of how Judaism was progressive compared to the other nations 3000 years ago, yada, yada &#8211; but the simple understanding still has had an effect.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to solve a problem you first have to admit it exists instead of trying to explain it away as all about perception.   That&#8217;s not to say that women aren&#8217;t happy with it.  I&#8217;m sure generations of women never gave it a second thought and lived happy fulfilled lives.   Today, just as you see Mormon wives of one man describing how happy they are with their wonderful shared husband, and it boggles the modern mind, so too I&#8217;m sure many of the women in the insular ultra orthodox community are happy with their role.  </p>
<p>But, for those who have embraced the modern world, and are uncomfortable with their status in the Orthodox community, it&#8217;s a real problem.  Maybe the apologetics were helpful in the past century.  Today, for many, they&#8217;re not.   You can either be honest and say this is the approach G-d expects, tough &#8211; and let the cards fall where they may.  Or, look at what&#8217;s really Torah prescribed and untouchable and what&#8217;s byproducts of rabbinic thought as seen through the eyes of their generation and look to see how we can work in those areas to affect positive change.    </p>

<p>If you&#8217;re going to solve a problem you first have to admit it exists instead of trying to explain it away as all about perception.   That&#8217;s not to say that women aren&#8217;t happy with it.  I&#8217;m sure generations of women never gave it a second thought and lived happy fulfilled lives.   Today, just as you see Mormon wives of one man describing how happy they are with their wonderful shared husband, and it boggles the modern mind, so too I&#8217;m sure many of the women in the insular ultra orthodox community are happy with their role.  </p>
<p>But, for those who have embraced the modern world, and are uncomfortable with their status in the Orthodox community, it&#8217;s a real problem.  Maybe the apologetics were helpful in the past century.  Today, for many, they&#8217;re not.   You can either be honest and say this is the approach G-d expects, tough &#8211; and let the cards fall where they may.  Or, look at what&#8217;s really Torah prescribed and untouchable and what&#8217;s byproducts of rabbinic thought as seen through the eyes of their generation and look to see how we can work in those areas to affect positive change.    </p>

<p>While this is generally true, I think that when the sh*t hits the fan (war, economic dislocation, hyperinflation, etc), and people&#8217;s lives are disrupted, a lot of the morality and ethics can go quickly out the window.</p>

The people carrying out what they think is the correct interpretation of Torah are human, and therefore fallible.  But Hashem is neither.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-8830" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Although I found the original article irritating, I take exception to your article as well.  I am a frum Jewish Woman and have been for over half a century.  Never have I felt like a second class citizen , quite the opposite as a matter of fact and I have relayed this phenomenon to my non Jewish counterparts countless times throughout my life.  The entire religion is carried through the centuries and really rests solely on our shoulders.  The whole question of who is a Jew is fully and completely determined through the maternal line, hence through a woman.  You are NOT a Jew if your mother was not a Jew and her mother before her, etc.  we don&#8217;t recognize halves, quarters, eighths, etc.  we believe in wholes and completes and that is only determined by a woman.  That makes us women the most powerful and trusted species in the religion.</p>
<p>A man can have a hundred children but if not born to a jewish woman they are not Jewish.  Wow how powerful and important are we?  It matters not if the man is a king, a Rabbi,  the wealthiest man alive.  It truly levels the playing field.  Even if the mother is the lowliest servant on earth but is still a Jew, the child will be a Jew .  Wow how powerful is that?</p>
<p>Furthermore, you neglect to mention that only in cases where a true question is involved where neither the husband nor the wife can determine if the discharge on the underwear is a problem or not, does one have to consult a Rabbi.  Nor do you mention that the wife can also go to the Kallah teacher who might know the answer, nor do you mention how the whole thing is done in a very discrete manner where the Rav doesn&#8217;t even need to know who is asking the question or who the item belongs to.  I find your article and your attitude very cynical and not helpful to the cause at all.  If ou are looking to help the plight and equality of women it would be best if you concentrate on real issues such as abuse and blackmail.  Also how the batei dinim do not treat women fairly and with compassion and basically allow men to walk away epwithout responsibility or accountability for their actions.  Please place fault and blame here it is due and not on the chassidus or on the religion or Halacha itself.  It is with those who interpret the Halacha for their means and purposes and not in th way the Halacha was intended </p>

Don&#8217;t fool yourself, we all know why that Kj husband can afford to lavish her with jewels and she can afford to sit in the sun with her kids?!!!?!! Its because u guys are not that observant as you would like to portray yourself. Were you taught lying is a sin? Were you taught stealing is a sin? I&#8217;m sure you were. So how can anyone take you seriously when you pick and choose what mitzvos you want or wont observe. In the real sense of the word you are off the derech. It doesn&#8217;t matter if u look one way or another, you are swerving away from true religious observance.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-8834" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Rabbi, your judgemental essay does a disservice to the reader. Your judegement is based upon your personal perception of what makes people happy or sad, fullfilled or un fullfilled which initself is based on where you are today. I know many member and rabbi&#8217;s of Chabad Lubavitch as well and members (men and women) of Satmir who are extremely happy with their personal status within their respective communities. I consider my as an Observant Jew as I am unable to observe some of the common laws. Because of where I live I must drive to shul which is and will remain my problem as I will not be moving in the foreseeable future. In addition I know that neither I nor my wife would not be happy in most  of the Chasidic communities, mostly because it was not part of our lives in the past. But, some of the members of the Satmir communities that we know, who did not grow up Satmir are very happy-one is even a convert. You speak of the women being kept back, how they dress, they can&#8217;t vote, etc. which may be factual-depending on the community-but that is only a negative to you not to them. There are members of any community who are more or less happy than others. Arranged marriages may not be to your taste but the incidence of divorce is much lower-to which you&#8217;ll argue they have no choice. As you know -Orthodox marriages are usually not arranged. Orthodox men and women date, learn about each other through talking, what they like , where they want to go in their lives and how they want to live those lives. They decide if they should marry and the parents have already checked the backgrounds and the families. They also make sure that they are in fact Jewish.  Chasdis came about to preserve the european ways of Jewish religious and social practice during the pograms. They exist to continue these ways. Chabad Lubavitch does more outreach  than any other Jewish group in the world. They don&#8217;t try to make their students become anything other than than Jews who practice today more than they did yesterday. Rabbi, I could go on and on discussing what you&#8217;ve written-but at the end it&#8217;s still you judging others, which as Jews we should not be doing. Have a god Shabbos and a Great Yom Tov.   </p>

Personally, I view that concept in the Nietzschean sense of the struggle between Judaic and Roman ideals etc. My point, which you failed to answer, is that no matter how perfectly Jews follow Judaic principles there will be those who vehemently despise and disagree with our ideals.<br />
Your second question would again only apply to the box you chose to put me in. In my view your question is meaningless. Your question is also logically meaningless because I never proposed PR, I was responding to your statement of when PR is neccessary. And even those who view every Gentile as an antisemite (a view which I see no reason to take) as a fete accompli there is still room for PR. To put it simply without discussing the variables, I would prefer a person who calls me a dirty kike behind my back than one who send me to a gas chamber. Logic, my friend logic.<br />
 <br />
As an aside Rabbi Adlerstein commentary has no bearing if someone elses view is right or wrong. I find it preposterous that you would argue that a statement in gemara can not have a certaiin interpretation because some rabbi had another view.<br />
 <br />
Now please answer just one of my questions. You said &#8220;If we fix our problems WE WON&#8217;T NEED PR.&#8221; If we fix our problems would you tell your gay friends that you stand by the torah which says it is an abomination, or would you PR your way out of it? </p>

In the past couple weeks I have watched both Pearl Perry (part 1 at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rO6PXoTO1bQ) and Deborah Feldman (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8bcbYf1k-k" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-comment', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8bcbYf1k-k', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8bcbYf1k-k');" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8bcbYf1k-k</a>) rant in unsophisticated English about their most horrible experiences in the Hassidic community, now being able to broadcast them having scandalously left their respective communities. Both publicly embarrassed themselves (by expressing their ideas with slightly too much emotional fervour for national TV,  but let&#8217;s even say they&#8217;re free to make whatever impression they want of themselves&#8230;) as well as embarrassing Orthodox Jewry as a WHOLE!<br />
Both misrepresented thousands and thousands of people, using their pain to generalise for hundreds of communities, to pin this somewhat &#8216;evil&#8217; description of frum Rabbis all around the world. As I watched, I cringed. I have friends in a variety of Hassidic communities and I tell you, poor Deborah and Pearl are the minority. Because they know nothing better? I admit this could be true in some cases, but hey, happiness is happiness.<br />
When I read Chaya&#8217;s article I breathed a sigh of relief. Finally, someone had the sense to write something GOOD about Jewish Orthodoxy. It was positive, it was forward, it was funny, it was everything people needed to hear. The comments were great &#8211; people asked questions about Judaism in interest, not in criticism, as some had in response to the above youtube videos). It was a success Rabbi, Orthodox Judaism got just a little bit of respect for a change.<br />
You&#8217;re saying she generalised? I&#8217;m saying so many others have generalised about Orthodoxy for the worse, let her do it for the better! Let her speak for all those people, Chabad AND other Chassidim who are truly happy with their way of life.<br />
I mean, you&#8217;re a frum Rabbi, don&#8217;t you want to be represented in a positive light? Why are you complaining?<br />
And I mean, saying that Chaya is setting you back &#8216;several decades&#8217; in advocating for women&#8217;s rights &#8211; really. How so? What so in order for us to succeed in creating more opportunities for women in insular Hassidic communities, you need the whole online community and the media to believe that Jewish women are oppressed and unhappy and in need of saving? You need an increase in antisemitism? Who are you kidding?</p>

Myself like Chaya were/are members of both worlds at one span of time and we both CAN speak objectively.  I would any day shave my head, follow halacha as observantly as this oppressive sexually and lustfilled world/culture will allow, have a rabbi check my underware 5 times a day, and I would  find it less repressive then this feministic culturally relative world-view which I am most confident from your point of view  I \&#8221;ironically\&#8221; find most oppressive.
