		<description><![CDATA[The Law - &lt;i&gt;the “largesse” doesnt need to stifle anything or anyone, every single detail, chumrah, kulah, minhag, is a teachable moment for our kids.&lt;/i&gt;

Unfortunately, it often teaches them that a lot of what we do is nonsense. That may sound Orthoprax, but it isn&#039;t, it&#039;s true. This is especially because our schools do a bad job at Jewish education. And it definitely does stifle the teaching of the real principles, and the inculcating of joy into the practice.

Shabbat Shalom all!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But Orthodox rabbis view Reform and Conservative as &quot;not Jewish&quot; and feel that Jews should be going to Orthodox shuls and having Orthodox rabbis officiate weddings and have kosher ketubahs.  So there are many people who respect the Orthodox establishment as &quot;the establishment&quot; but may not be believers.  If someone doesn&#039;t really buy into the religious stuff or does not feel spiritual but decides to attend an Orthodox Yom Kippur service, shouldn&#039;t that be seen as a good thing?  Does that make them Orthoprax?  How can a religion demand its followers to BELIEVE in the religion when the religion defines them as Jews simply by their birth and never requires them to make an intelligent or emotional decision to have a connection with G-d through traditional observance?

The Orthoprax article is hypocritical.  Either let Jews belong to Reform temples or accept that there will be Orthoprax in your midst in shul...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[maybe, but the remedy isnt making judaism less focused on our duties, its educating so that ppl understand the &quot;why&quot; behind all the large mesorah.

the &quot;largesse&quot; doesnt need to stifle anything or anyone, every single detail, chumrah, kulah, minhag, is a teachable moment for our kids.

my father used to make our family succah using lavud, dofen akuma, gud achis, etc... (obviously not using moshe misinai tools together as that would be unacceptable)  He did this in order to use our practical mitzvah observance as a teaching moment.  ever since my love and appreciation for halacha and all its intricacies, probably why i also ended up becoming &quot;The Law&quot; in my secular career....

education is paramount and thats the answer...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Law, I think you just solved the conundrum of why Orthopraxy is on the rise!!!!!!!!!!!!  I&#039;m not kidding at all and I thank you.

Early Judaism had a mesorah, but that mesorah was relatively simple and made up of basic concepts. One God. No idols. Eat this and not that. Honor parents. Tefillin. Say Shema in AM and in PM. Etc. That relatively compact mesorah could be passed from father to son over their lifetime together rather easily.

Today we have an exhaustively large mesorah that is impossible for anyone to keep straight in their own minds much less pass it to their children over their lifetime together. So we write everything down, and we make up all sorts of new stuff (call them &quot;chumrot&quot; or minhagim or whatever) that are endlessly coming at us making us feel that it is hopeless to ever be able to learn it all well enough for ourselves, and definitely impossible to teach to our children. This &quot;largesse&quot; is stifling the joy of our religion for many (most?) people!

Put on tefillin because you are supposed to put them on, but instead people have mirrors, they constantly adjust them, they want special batim, special straps, &quot;mine are better than yours&quot;, Rabbeinu Tam, Rashi, Gassot, Peshutim mehudarim, Peshutim, Dakot, different sizes, ktav Beis Yosef,  Arizal, Velish, etc. Just talking about it is exhausting and sucks the joy out of the mitzvah!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Law - &lt;i&gt;If you can only say we do this b/c that&#039;s what grandpa did, that&#039;s sad and &lt;b&gt;ultimately destined for failure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

This sounds logical, but then I think - how did Judaism survive for it&#039;s first few thousand years of having the vast majority of its people relatively uneducated in the practice of Judaism, and in fact, did what their fathers and grandfathers did?

So, if this is the case, when do you expect &quot;ultimately&quot; to occur?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt; &lt;b&gt;  (It’s ironic because the Orthoprax, by dint of their theology value the acts of Judaism MORE than the beliefs of Judaism. While the Orthodox need to balance the two and one could be Orthodox and still sin all the time. That is why we have Yom Kippur and the mitzva of Teshuva. In other words, I would expect an Orthodox Jew to sin at least as often as an Orthoprax. But I digress.) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

The issue is and nafka mina is that the dox may sin just as much, but they believe it is still a sin and something wrong, the prax dont as there is little meaning behind the act.

I think you are missing the forest for the trees with regard to the overall point of the rabbi&#039;s essay.  Going through the motions, or doing the acts devoid of meaning leads to a path of nothingness.

this is not a LW/RW/MO/Yeshivish issue, its a belief issue.  this isnt RJ/CJ/OJ issue. its a religious issue.

its how we can transmit to the next generation, our children what it means to be jewish.  If you can only say we do this b/c thats what grandpa did, thats sad and ultimately destined for failure (see Halachik Man from the Rav for more; also see his essays on mimetic tradition, but i digress)

its not name calling, and if you think it is you are being superficial.  Its about identifying a problem.  going through the motions, regardless of religious label is bad. it leads to a meaningless &quot;religious&quot; life that will end in cynical attacks on religious beliefs and traditions.  or, down the road to ethical monotheism...]]></description>
