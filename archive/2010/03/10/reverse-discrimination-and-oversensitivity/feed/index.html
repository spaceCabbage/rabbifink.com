		<description><![CDATA[This post was inspired by the previous post so it only stands to reason that it would follow the previous post...

It&#039;s cool that you purchased all kinds of dolls for your kids.

I should have wrote this in the post, but my son has a set of &quot;neighborhood figures&quot; and the minorities have all the &quot;good jobs&quot; like Dr., nurse, business attire and the white ones have the &quot;lower class jobs&quot; like farmers and garbage collectors...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Another example of reverse discrimination and oversensitivity is that you wouldn&#039;t have ever considered posting &lt;b&gt;this&lt;/b&gt; post first, and yesterdays &lt;b&gt;second&lt;/b&gt;. :-)

We&#039;ve purchased some brown skinned dolls for our girls*, partially because they were on sale, and partially because we want them to know that babies/dolls come in all skin tones (like their cousins in Israel, for example, who have very dark skin).


* And even more &quot;discrimination&quot; here, as I said &quot;girls&quot; rather than &quot;kids&quot;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[in the video the childrens voices and inflection rise in tone toward the end of the sentences, this shows that their intentions in selections are done to please the adults administering the &quot;study&quot;.  this destroys the credibility of the &quot;study&quot;.
