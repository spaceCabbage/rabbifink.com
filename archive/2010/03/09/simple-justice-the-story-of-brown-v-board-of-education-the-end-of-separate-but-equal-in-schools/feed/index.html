		<description><![CDATA[People can hate people, but hating someone for their ethnicity or color is despicable. The Supreme Court is not charged with the task of changing people&#039;s minds and attitudes, that is our own task.

Winners, haves and heroes are fine, but they cannot be defined by meaningless characteristics like race and ethnicity.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[fair enough.  but ppl will always hate other ppl.  nothing will ever change that, not even the supreme court.

Utopia cannot exist were everyone just gets along.  we need winners and losers, haves and have-nots, heroes and villans, etc....

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;today racism is a charge thats leveled only when there is something to gain or when wielded like a cudgel to get ones way…&lt;/i&gt;

True, there is little institutionalized racism, but bigotry is still common among the &quot;people&quot;. I hear racial slurs often enough to justify this claim.

But stay tuned, tomorrow&#039;s post will discuss some of the &quot;double-standards&quot; and reverse racism that had become ridiculous.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt; In just 56 years, much has changed in the landscape of race relations in the USA. Some things are still the same, or at the very least follow the same bigoted roots. &lt;/i&gt;

and some still love to raise the banner of victimhood making every single thing into a racial one.  Some even have double standards, making only SOME things racist while ignoring other and whitewashing them completely.  (for a very recent example see the &quot;Obama couldnt sell watermellons&quot; comment of a nightly news anchor who if the same was said by a talk radio host who wears a cowboy hat all hell would break loose)
