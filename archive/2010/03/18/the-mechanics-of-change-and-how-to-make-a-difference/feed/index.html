		<description><![CDATA[As far as I know, plenty of regulation occurs under the Executive branch. I think Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is there, and if I am not mistaken, EPA (potentially the biggest regulator of all) is also there. I also wouldn&#039;t be at all surprised if the so-called &quot;War on Drugs&quot; is waged from that branch as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[many constitutional scholars have concluded that this health care bill is unconstitutional.  Either because the federal government cannot force citizens to purchase something (whereas state governments can - i.e. car insurance which is regulated at the state level), or   because government cannot tell a private enterprise that it must lower its own profits.

Telling health insurance companies that they must cover pre-existing conditions is like telling casinos that they must accept a bet on &quot;red&quot; after the roulette ball has landed on a red number.  How long would casinos be profitable after a law like that was passed?]]></description>
