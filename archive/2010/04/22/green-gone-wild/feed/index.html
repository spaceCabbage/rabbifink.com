		<description><![CDATA[Yoni makes a point that should be expanded upon...an analysis of &quot;great ideas&quot; shows an obvious (after stated) point - there is a simple ratio of great ideas per year per billion people.  Something like (remembering, not quoting) 0.5 great ideas per 1 billion people-years of invested thinking.  So today we get an average of 2-3 great world changing ideas a year.  And correspondingly we see that for most of recorded history, with low population levels, technology and science moved very very slowly.  Even arts, philosophy, and religion developed very very slowly.

Nowadays technology and science are moving at an incredible pace. And yes, arts, philosophy, and even religion is developing/changing quickly.

So indeed, with more people we are more likely to come up with solutions to environmental problems - even while those more people cause increased stresses on the environment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With all due respect, you do not make a compelling point. It seems that you merely point out why you think having children is really important, and that it trumps environmental considerations. You don&#039;t seem to offer any support for your viewpoint (no matter how much I agree with you, it&#039;s a fundamentally unsupportable viewpoint, since it really boils down to a matter of personal values; in addition, some of the &quot;proofs&quot; you bring are entirely assailable). It&#039;s no more persuasive than a &quot;Did not - Did too!&quot; line of reasoning (full disclosure - it&#039;s late, and I read your post quickly).

I think a better argument would be that a person can affect the amount of carbon in the world in two ways - adding to it (e.g., driving a car, turning on the A/C, etc.), and reducing it, by coming up with &quot;green&quot; technologies (e.g., alternative energy sources, more efficient cars, A/Cs, etc.).

Ms. Hymas is focused on the first kind, but that is far from the full picture.

In my line of work, I come across a lot of people who affect the amount of carbon by reducing it. And the reductions of a single person can offset the additions of many, many others. (For example, a technology which increases the efficiency of a solar power plant by a few percent, may reduce the amount of carbon released into the air equivalent to the amount added by 100s of people. Multiply this by the number of times that the technology is implemented, and it really adds up.) I came to the realization (or maybe just rationalizing my growing brood) that the more people there are in the world, the more people there will be working to reduce the amount of carbon. I don&#039;t know if the net effect will be a reduction in the amount of carbon, but it&#039;s something to be taken into account.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink,

I&#039;d like ask her what she thinks about her parents not following her advice!  But I think she&#039;s right about one thing.  Not everyone should become a parent.  Parenthood takes responsibility and sacrifice.  There are many people who are not responsible, and / or are too selfish to make the sacrifices, and maybe it&#039;s better they don&#039;t become parents.  Same goes with any of the awful stories you hear of abuse, incest or even a parent murdering his / her own child.  There would be an example of someone who should not have had children.

If, as you said, she&#039;s only using the environmental angle as another consideration to those who are undecided, it doesn&#039;t bother me as much.  If parenthood is not clearly what someone wants, maybe it&#039;s better they don&#039;t.

But it&#039;s sort of like when (insert car company name here) offers you $500 cash back.  That&#039;s only going to win over someone who was already considering that car.  I doubt it would attract someone who previously had no intention of buying one.  She&#039;s not going to dissuade someone who had already decided to have children.  If someone would actually be swayed by this alone, maybe that&#039;s not a bad thing either.

		<description><![CDATA[I completely agree with her; She shouldn&#039;t have kids. :-)

But she is absolutely correct, increasing world population is one of the primary causes of increased carbon emission and use of the earths resources. Another primary cause is improving the standard of living of the worlds population (India and China are prime examples of this).]]></description>
