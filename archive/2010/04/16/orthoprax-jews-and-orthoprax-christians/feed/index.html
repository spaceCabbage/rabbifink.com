		<description><![CDATA[Mark
I see Orthopraxy
I also see a lot of stereotyping
I think Rabbi Fink&#039;s separating out the &quot;by default&quot; group does a lot toward the goal of avoiding: name calling , &quot;calling out&quot; and stereotyping. It is solution based.

The Problem
1) How do we help closet Orthoprax?
In &quot;The Unbelievers&quot; they cannot even find each other.
Is it easier to find Orthoprax if their entire life is programed (ie Jews)

2) Education seems to be the problem and not the solution for many of the &quot;The Unbelievers&quot;

 It would be convenient to say we (Orthodox Jews) are different from &quot;The Unbelievers&quot;.

But...

I dont think the article gives us anything more than a quick glance at &quot;The Unbelievers&quot;
It does not mention doubt, only believers and non-believers.
Easier for someone to ask a question if they are NOT the Clergy]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi Fink - &lt;i&gt;Lately, thereâ€™s been a lot of talk of Orthopraxy within the Orthodox Jewish world.&lt;/i&gt;

To me, it looked more like a lot of name-calling that stopped short of &quot;calling out&quot; individuals. In other words, a part of the &quot;frummer than thou&quot; movement.

Though I don&#039;t disagree that there are plenty of people out there, of all religions, who practice without believing (or without fully believing).]]></description>
