		<description><![CDATA[more of an issue than my previous comment is that it is a difficult assumption to make. How would this assumption deal with the statement in Pirkei Avot defining a machloket shelo lshem shamayim as being that of Korach and his group? if his motives were altruistic, I dont think his argument would qualify as the paradigm of shelo lshem shamayim]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;God gives assistance to those who are moser nefesh.&lt;/i&gt;


Isn&#039;t this generally obvious in everyday life? For example God gives a better parnassah to those who are moser nefesh to spend a few years studying hard in college. I mean just look at unemployment statistics today - those with a college degree, who have been moser nefesh, have about a 4% unemployment rate, while those who have not have an unemployment rate north of 11%. And this is but one example.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This provides a strong opening for acceptance of the opinion of the Satmar Rebbe&#039;s on the formation of the State of Israel and its miraculous victory in 1967, against the majority opinion that the clear miracles show Yad Hashem. Perhaps God helped but only because the founders, the fighters, were being moser nefesh, even though maybe they were wrong...]]></description>
