		<description><![CDATA[R&#039; Fink:

I didn&#039;t click on the link, but here are a couple thoughts.  I think that on the one hand you&#039;re very correct about the general sources of bias in young children; they like what they are familiar with.  So, in very young children, you find preferences for the language they hear spoken most often.  It&#039;s not because they are little nationalists, but rather because it&#039;s what they are used to.

At the same time, stereotypes exist, and just the awareness of and internalization of stereotypes can affect one&#039;s attitudes in subtle ways.  It&#039;s a pretty interesting question in modern social cognition: people have implicit attitudes (that are not consciously held) that may bias them nonetheless.  It is incorrect and unfair to call this racism, but it&#039;s a great question how this should be handled in the law.

I&#039;d be happy to send you a nice review of this kind of social cognition and its implications for law.  Here&#039;s the citation:  Kristin A. Lane, Jerry Kang, and Mahzarin R. Banaji . (2007.)  Implicit Social Cognition and Law. The Annual Review of Law and Social Science.

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Read the post. I said &quot;Is racism a problem? Yes.&quot; And it is a problem. I am not saying it is not a problem.

&gt; Bias exists. No person can think the exact same way another person does. It is just as important to realize that as much as a bias can lead to racism, it is natural for children to feel comfortable in their own environments. Isolated environments are what cause white bias, but even if a white family lives in a very diverse neighborhood, their whole family is white, their cousins, grandparents and siblings are white. Can&#039;t you see there is nothing invidious about a barely coherent child gravitating to people that look like the people he knows best??!!

&gt; Cooper most certainly was preaching without saying it explicitly. The whole show the parents the video scene was purely concocted to make the parents feel guilty. Kids are not adults. They don&#039;t make choices like adults. And presenting the material the way he did was unfair.

&gt; There are societal issues that need to be dealt with. But this study is not indicative of those issues. Your point about seeing white power everywhere is CORRECT. And that is something that should be addressed but this study does not contribute to the discussion.

&gt; Parents should talk about it with their children. But a 5 year old may not even &quot;get&quot; what the parents are talking about. That&#039;s why this study is dumb.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Eli, it&#039;s not an issue of whether white bias is racist. It&#039;s the effect of white bias regardless of it&#039;s intent. And more importantly, why white bias even exists.

When you say, &quot;Cooper and his team think this is a result of racist parents and preaching diversity and tolerance but not practicing it at home&quot; you are absolutely misconstruing the results.  And I&#039;ve heard you say before, &quot;racism doesn&#039;t exist.&quot;

Both of these statements are absolutely false. Nowhere does Cooper insinuate that any of the parents are racists nor that they are hypocrites preaching one thing and doing another. Instead, I believe he&#039;s pointing to  much larger and problematic issue, namely, that we&#039;ve all been taught to &quot;tolerate&quot; each other and be &quot;color-blind&quot; and try to ignore the idea of race altogether. When parents don&#039;t step up and make race an issue to be discussed with their children, when they just pretend it&#039;s not there even though, as you pointed out, it&#039;s clearly there, we let children create their own notions of race. This might be ok if we weren&#039;t all bombarded with notions of &quot;white is right&quot; every single day.  Once parents allow the media &amp; society to mold their children&#039;s notion of race -- that&#039;s where we get white bias.

And you brush this off as though it&#039;s perfectly ok, that &quot;oh, of course children like white things because their parents are white and white means safe&quot; -- but that&#039;s the problem! When your teacher is white, and your soccer coach is white, and your doctor is white, your barbie is white, and everyone on TV is white and every pretty model in magazines is white, children automatically associate whiteness with power, respect, beauty and goodness.

We&#039;re BOMBARDED with white is right and it&#039;s irresponsible for white parents to ignore it and not talk about it with their children -- that&#039;s the problem with white bias. And yes, that&#039;s what makes it racist.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A couple of quick off-the-top-of-my-head comments:

1. In America we read from left to right, and when we first look at a page we look generally from left to right.  Would the results of the CNN study have been different if the illustrations were presented in reverse order? What if they were presented in a circle, or not from lightest to darkest but randomly?

2. What results would one get for children in the Congo, or China? What results would you get with white American children given choices of skin color that did not inlude white, or with black children ...etc.?

3. I agree with your irresponsible journalism conclusion - but even more important, perhaps it is revealing a liberal media bias towards concluding that such racism exists that they did not consider 1 and 2 above, and that they labeled certain views as &quot;racist&quot; without considering other possible explanations for the results of their study.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We refer to so many things with the words black and white, including good and bad, or clean and dirty. it is a normal extension for kids to see skin colors that way too, but it is learned. My dad has often told about the first time my sister and i heard a person referred to as black and we started looking for him because the only people we saw were pink and brown.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Victor Frankl quote says it all.  There are two races, the decent and the indecent.  As for children, I do not believe they gravitate to those who resemble themselves.  When one of my kids was in pre-school there was an extremely obese classmate.  My child never noticed.  Unfortunately in certain religious communities, children are taught that those of another group do not merit the same respect.  Why do people hate?  Perhaps children left to their own endeavors, judge playmates individually, but when parents impose their biases, it seems likely they impart their values upon their progeny.]]></description>
