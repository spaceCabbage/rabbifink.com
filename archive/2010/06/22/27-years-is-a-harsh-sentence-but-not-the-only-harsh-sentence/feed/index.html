Rubashkin&#039;s sentence is long yet within the sentencing guidelines. I wish more people would actually read the sentencing report. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;The memo does address the strictness of the sentence but not in comparison to others. There are not that many similar cases. And the closest I can find is Skilling who got a very similar sentence.&quot;

I don&#039;t think it is fair to compare the Enron fraud to the Rubashkin fraud. Skilling&#039;s fraud resulted in a loss of $40 Billion, including the life savings of many people, and many jobs. I live in Houston, where I have met many people who&#039;s live were thrown through a lurch because of Skilling&#039;s fraud. I have seen different amounts reported for Rubashkin&#039;s fraud, but all of them were less than $40 Million.

&quot;The fact that you assume that the crux of the matter is that “we are talking about the Jews” is not based in reality.&quot;
I do not assume that Rubashkin is a vicitm of anti-semitism (although I think its a possibility). My point was that it is impossible to call a sentence fair if others with similar (or worse crimes) received significantly lighter sentences.

&quot;(H)ere the court is NOT talking about the Jews, it is talking about a Not Guilty plea where there was overwhelming evidence against a plaintiff..&quot;

The funny thing about modern day anti-semitism, when it exists, is that it is almost always cloaked in other terms (e.g. &quot;human rights&quot;) so that even when they are &quot;talking about the Jews,&quot; they never use the word &quot;Jew.&quot; Which is what makes the Lowell story even more relevant. After a public outcry about Lowell&#039;s intent to set quotas on Jews at Harvard, Harvard instead adopted policies that involved background checks of all applicants, which allowed them to limit Jewish enrollment without explicitly doing so.

&quot;Don’t get me wrong. I am against harsh sentences. But Rubashkin’s harsh sentence is not anti-semitically driven.&quot;

Judicial discretion, by its nature, lends itself to the possibility of improper exercise of that discretion. If the improper exercise is motivated by a defendant&#039;s Judaism, that would be anti-semitism. Without reading the judges mind (I only know one Bochen Levavos), how can you know what motivated her?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Smaller&quot; is a relative term. Does the sentencing memorandum address the relative strictness of the sentence compared to other sentences received for similar crimes? I have not read it, but I dount it, and that is really the crux of the matter, as is illustrated by the following story that I saw quoted on cross-currents: of &quot;a famous exchange between Harvard’s racist president, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, and the great American judge Learned Hand. Lowell announced that he wanted to reduce the number of Jews at Harvard, because, “Jews cheat.” Judge Hand replied that “Christians also cheat.” Lowell responded, “You’re changing the subject. We are talking about Jews.”]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that the &quot;traditional right-wing / republican / conservative / Judeo-Christian&quot; view is more nuanced than you allow. Many people (myself included) think that stiff sentences are appropriate for violent crimes, and larger-scale white collar crimes, (think Madoff, Skilling, etc), but support lighter sentences for non-violent crimes/white collar crimes that are of a smaller scale. Along those lines, I think that Rubashkin got a raw deal, but Martin Grossman did not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[white collar crimes are also felonies - true, and it&#039;s a shanda when a jew (let alone a frum Jew) commits a crime of any kind.  I&#039;m ashamed and embarrassed of the crime itself, whether or not he/she gets caught.

Some of the Jewish criminals do get caught.  Some get convicted for their white collar felonies.

How many of them get convicted, serve time, and then come right back out and do it again??????

I stand by my support for three strikes.  Get convicted once, shame on you.  Get convicted twice, shame on us.  Three times, stop clogging up the court system already!

As a side note, I do support any reasonable measures to make jail more rehabilitative and less purely punitive.  In Israel, many small time thugs and gang bangers come out of jail as chozrim b&#039;tshuvah.  Some of them do indeed slide back out of Judaism and into old habits - but many remain (secular and jewish) law abiding citizens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Sentencing guidelines for white collar crime have nothing to do with three strikes.
&lt;/em&gt;

Yes they do. White collar crimes are also felonies.

&lt;em&gt;If a frum Jew committed three felonies, I&#039;d also want him or her locked up for life.  I don&#039;t care how non-violent or minor they are - if yirat hashem doesn&#039;t stop such a person from criminal activity, at least the first two convictions should!!!
&lt;/em&gt;

With friends like you, who needs enemies!?

&lt;em&gt;I haven&#039;t been following the Rubashkin case.  If his sentence is longer than other people received who were convicted of similar offenses, something is wrong here.  If not, not.&lt;/em&gt;
