		<description><![CDATA[My question to you: Is the corpus of knowledge, as you refer to it, true and existing or is it all nice sounding hocas-pocas? Does the &quot;extra spirituality&quot; that kaballah infuses in yoga have a real effect on ones physical being or not? When someone does yoga in the form of otiyot, does it give the yoga a bigger chance of success?

In other words: Do you believe in the basis of kaballah as something mystical that has tremendous impact on the world and on ones physical being, or do you view it as some nice interpretation of the torah?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeedle:

What you quoted above from the post, is 100% accurate. Personally, I don&#039;t study that corpus of knowledge. Plenty of others do.

I maintain that kabbala used in HALACHA makes me uncomfortable. However kabbala used in Yoga is a totally different story. Yoga is nice on its own but yoga with extra spirituality infused in it is even better. There is no deception here. Kabbala is being used here to enhance the yoga experience. It is NOT being used to supplant Torah or influence halacha.

To me, this exactly where kabbala works BEST. As part of a spiritual exercise that improves the exercise and not dictating Torah&#039;s observance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It struck me funny that a guy like Rabbi Fink would write the following words: &quot;The letters of the Hebrew Aleph-Bet have been interpreted in many ways. There is an entire corpus of study that uses the letters, their shapes, their sounds and their numerical values as tools for unlocking Torah secrets.&quot;

If you follow me and Rabbi Fink on twitter you definitely heard Rabbi Fink&#039;s opinion about Kaballah, and to quote him (I couldn&#039;t find the tweet so I&#039;m quoting from memory. The exact language Rabbi Fink used might have been slightly different.) &quot;Whenever it comes to a halacha that has it source in Kaballah, I&#039;m EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE&quot;.

And here you have Rabbi Fink write up a whole post all about the wonder&#039;s of Kaballah Yoga, to which - I assume - the guy teaching it attributes a lot of its powers to the secret power of kaballah. Isn&#039;t this funny?]]></description>
