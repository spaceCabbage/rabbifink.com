		<description><![CDATA[MEDIA LIES AND TRIES TO ESTABLISH A SLANDEROUS NARRATIVE ABOUT O&#039;DONNELL.

http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2010-10-20-churchstate19_st_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip

Yep. They won&#039;t relent because the media knows that once they establish a narrative (Evolution is a proven fact) they won&#039;t have to argue or present fact anymore but just ridicule the opponent.

How opposite this is from a Torah and Talmud believing Jew. In Judaism, the majority interpretation of Torah Law may well be indistinguishable from the written Torah in terms of its application; however, this fact never implies that the prevailing interpretation or legal precedent is the only interpretation.  In fact, Judaism never assumes that it is necessarily the best interpretation.  Every page of the Talmud is filled with records of opposing opinions.  Why?  Because the rabbis assert the axiom that we must never suppress the opinion of others since a minority opinion of today may one day be the majority opinion.  Christine O’Donnell may hold a minority opinion on the first Amendment today, but yesterday and perhaps sometime in the future she may be in the majority.

There&#039;s no doubt in my mind that Rabbi Fink and you agree with the above. And now knowing the truth that the media misrepresented and continues to misrepresent O&#039;Donnell&#039;s exchanges, you should correct anyone who immediately falls into the slanderous trap the media has set and pulled. The truth is that the phrase &#039;separation of church and state&#039; is not in the Constitution and further as a doctrine it not even the majority of Americans hold the current judicial interpretation. There is nothing wrong with that. Dred Scott was once the law of the land as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[O&#039;Donnell for Senate is a stretch, a very big stretch. And yet I&#039;ll bet her intelligience and knowledge any day against Pelosi, Biden, Boxer, and Murray. Pelosi raises ignorance to a virtue. Remember these two statements: We have to pass the Health Care bill (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act)to find what&#039;s in it. And with regards to the Health Care bills constitutionality: Are you kidding me? (No. We&#039;re not. 20 state attorney generals have filed suits attacking the constitutionality of the Health Care Bill.)

But what are you going to do? Both parties have become so corrupt and if you believe in limited goverment and financial responsibility then the GOP&#039;s selection of Mike Castle was ridiculous. He received a consolation call from President Obama: &quot;Sorry to lose you from the team, old boy, but don&#039;t worry, we&#039;ll get you back on somewhere.&quot;

The Tea Party has responded to the elites who suppose they have a right to govern as masters. Besides O&#039;Donnell there are Ken Buck, Joe Miller, Chuck DeVore, Sharron Angle, Ruth McClung, Allen West, Rand Paul, Sean Bielat . . . who seek to destroy the stranglehold and corruption of those who only pretend to serve.]]></description>

I vehemently disagree that COD &lt;i&gt;meant&lt;/i&gt; to make such a nuanced point. She wasn&#039;t &quot;getting at&quot; anything. It was a flip remark that she appeared to regret saying the instant after she said it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While its certainly true that judicial intepretations of legislative language, unless they are onverturned by the court that issued them or a higher court, are the law of the land, there is a significant difference between these judicial decisions, and the legislative language they are interpreting. Overturning a judicial decision requires a reversal by the same court or a higher court, while changing the actual legislation requires that new legislation by the same legislative body (or in some cases, preemption by another legislative body with greater authority in that area) be introduced. Whether a law can be more easily changed by relegislation or judicial reversal depends on the the circumstances, but in the case of the U.S. Constitution, I think most observers would agree that a judicial reversal is far more likely than an amendment to the Constitution. That seemed to be what she was getting at, and if it was, there is nothing new about politicians speaking out about judicial decisions, and it is done by Democrats (think Obama&#039;s rebuke of the Court&#039;s deicision in Citizens United) or Republicans (think Sarah Palin&#039;s criticism of Court cases that she couldnt actually name) alike.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There were two questions by O&#039;Donnell to Coons and in the second of them O&#039;Donnell&#039;s actual question is:

&quot;So you’re telling me that the separation of church and state, the phrase ’separation of church and state’ is in the First Amendment?”

My sources for this is the following:

http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2010/10/separation-of-church-and-state.html at time 18 minutes and 12 seconds.

In O&#039;Donnel&#039;s question at this point in the debate, the words &quot;the phrase&quot; are used by O&#039;Donnell to try and find out whether or not Coons thought that the actual words &quot;separation of church and state&quot; were in the 1st amendment. Now, granted, if O&#039;Donnell had been more carefully listening to Coons she would have understood by his language that the separation of church and state had been later accomplished through &quot;decisional law by the Supreme Court&quot; (minute 17, second 59).

The real issue here is the misrepresentation by deletion of O&#039;Donnell&#039;s second question by the media so as to present to the public a wrong interpretation of O&#039;Donnell&#039;s attempt to pin Coons down on whether or not the statement, &quot;separation of church and state&quot; are in the 1st amendment. The following sources show the actual defamation of O&#039;Donnell.
http://althouse.blogspot.com/2010/10/odonnell-and-coons-on-separation-of.html and   http://ace.mu.nu/archives/307106.php

The first source is Ann Althouse, a law professor. The second is the blogsite, &quot;ACE.&quot; Now, as any Torah student well knows, defamation is a horrible sin and one for which the victim need not forgive the perpetrator.

The real issue from this event is the media&#039;s willingness to misrepresent a candidate for partisan reasons. O&#039;Donnell is not ignorant of the text of the 1st Amendment, but Coons could not name more than one of the five freedoms. Your statement that O&#039;Donnell is clueless is an allegation, certainly not a fact. If you had been given both quotes by O&#039;Donnell, you certainly could not have reasonably concluded that she meant what the media has been trying to spin.

I&#039;ll offer my own allegation. O&#039;Donnell was attempting to score a point and let her desire to do so distract her from realizing that Coons wasn&#039;t going to get a point scored against him for thinking that the actual language of the 1st amendment includes &quot;separation of church and state.&quot; But we&#039;ll forgive our little pugnaicious O&#039;Donnell. She&#039;s learning and will one day be a force to be reckoned with like Sarah Palin. Meanwhile, let&#039;s all of us try to keep the media more honest than it is.]]></description>
