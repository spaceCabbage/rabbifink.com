		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think Wikileaks is analogous to opening private mail.  Here&#039;s why: diplomats work for us.  If they work for us, we are entitled to their work product.  So there is nothing &quot;private&quot; about the &quot;mail&quot; in question. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Most of what I have seen or heard would seem to me to be protected by Herem DeRabeinu Gershom (not opening someone else&#039;s mail). A small amount may have a real need to be publicized. However I think that the privacy of communications issue is not the only problem with the mass publication of these documents. Governments need to be able to go about their business of governing and we as citizens of whatever country have an interest not only to ensure that they govern fairly but that they can govern effectively. If private communications are no longer that, then the ability to go about the government business of governing is curtailed. This is not transparency, this is rape and mass lashon hara.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think, quantitively, the damage they are actively committing to a nation ( or even many nations) and their relationships with one another and future fear of any sort of closed door discussions lest it come out publicly, is greater than misdeeds our nation has done. Every nation stumbles. But to purposely try to undermine a nation to its enemies (and even allies) is not a simple misdeed. It&#039;s calculated. Obviously, I am not a halachist, but lets just say if a bullet was to find this man and his informants, I would not be too sad. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On a personal level, I am really disgusted by these people. It&#039;s one thing to want your government to be held up to some atrocity they have committed, it&#039;s another to simply be a davkanick and publish information like this. I am in tremendous doubt that they do this in order to save lives. I think government needs confidentiality, diplomats require it. If government is to do its job, then closed doors must exist.  There must be a private realm. Honestly, I look at these people as akin to a &#039;rodef&#039; ]]></description>
