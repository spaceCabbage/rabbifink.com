		<description><![CDATA[    Just because an egg laid by a hen confined with several cagemates inside a 12&quot; x 18&quot; wire-mesh cage with hen droppings landing inside the cage from hens in the cages above is technically kosher if there are no bloodspots does not mean that it is moral, ethical, or perhaps even halachically permissible to consume it--or products like challah made with such inhumanely produced eggs.  Ein machazikin b&#039;ydei ovrei aveirah--one should not aid and abet a sin.  Purchasing food produced by major violations of Torah ethics aids and abets such evil.  I use tza&#039;ar ba&#039;alei chayim as the prime example because here there is the most clear cause-and-effect relationship between unacceptably produced products and what we chose to consume.  Orthodox rabbis have already forbidden white veal and foie gras; this principle can be extended to other factory farmed animal products as well.  The modern egg industry, for example, employs cruelties almost inconceivable to Jewish sages of a century ago:  battery cages inside ammonia-filled sheds, debeaking with hot blades, forced molting, maceration of &quot;useless&quot; male chicks in woodchippers, dead hens rotting in cages with live hens inside, to name the more blatant.  One short video from the Humane Society is worth ten thousand words: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE2pdzyd35g

    Michael Vick has admitted what he did to dogs was wrong and has sought to amend his ways.  Have we admitted our own complicity here and sought to improve our ways?  Factory farming causes far more animal suffering than dog fighting, the fur industry, or the Canadian seal hunt; moreover, it also oppresses many of the low wage, often immigrant workers doing the dirty work.  We dare not turn a blind eye.

    We should not have to choose between kashrut and Jewish ethics. Torah embraces both of them. K&#039;doshim tihiyu--You shall be holy--to which Ramban adds that one should not be a naval b&#039;reshut haTorah.  At every meal we make a choice.  We can and must live--and eat--to a higher standard.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;As far as I know, Reform Judaism has never officially sanctioned Kashrus observance.&quot;

Sanctioned is a funny word. It implies something that might not be allowed, but, since it&#039;s been sanctioned, it is allowed.

This misunderstands the Reform mindset on this. Most Reform Jews couldn&#039;t care less about kashrut. Those that do may keep any number of different types of kosher in their own lives, or they may vehemently object to it. Either way, it&#039;s no in the purview of &quot;Reform Judaism&quot;--whoever that it--to &quot;sanction&quot; it.

The Union for Reform Judaism (analogous to the OU, to some extent) is not in the ideology business overly much. The Central Conference of American Rabbis, however, do issue responsum. I&#039;m certain that there are some on kashrut. And I&#039;m certain that the gist is that keep kosher is cool if you&#039;re into it, but if you don&#039;t wanna, you eat what you want.

There are a number of Reform shuls (the far predate this stuff) that have kosher kitchens. And the rabbi at the Reform shul I grew up at keeps kosher.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Hopefully, by learning from each other, keeping an open mind, getting back to the source of Torah and trying to discover what God REALLY wants from us, we can bring more light into this world and help pave the way for a brighter future for everyone, Jews and non-Jews alike.&quot;

How much is wrong with that statement! 

First, the word &quot;hopefully.&quot; G-d&#039;s promises are sure. 

Second: Learning from each other. Like the Imam Rauf. 

Third: Keeping an open mind. To what? Transgression and iniquity. 

Fourth: Getting back to the source of the Torah. Whew. Isn&#039;t the Torah good enough. And I doubt that the &quot;source of the Torah&quot; you are referring to resembles the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It&#039;s like someone gets directions, looks at them and says, &quot;No. Wait. Forget the directions. Let&#039;s go talk to the guy who gave them and see what he really meant.&quot;

Fifth: What G-d really wants from us. How about to follow Torah. And you have a couple thousand years plus of really smart people explaining what that means. But noooo. You want to make up your own religion. And stand around patting each other on the back on how tolerant you are. Psssst. Big clue. It won&#039;t save you. The very same people you are extending hugs and kisses too--the Muslims and progressives--they hate you.

Sixth: Bring more light into this world. That&#039;s the concept. You missed.

Seventh: help pave the way for a brighter future for everyone, Jews and non-Jews alike. Please, just concentrate on yourself. G-d will bless the world when the Jews bless G-d with obedience.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;We don’t mistreat animals because G-d said not to do so. Period.&lt;/i&gt;

Except when we do...

&lt;i&gt;The halacha is that, if a kosher slaughterhouse went ahead and mistreated their animals – the people involved have trangressed halacha, but it does not affect the kosher status of the meat.

Fair treatment and timely payment of workers is also halachically mandated. Again, if a person mistreats his workers in a kosher slaughterhouse, that person has transgressed halacha, but the kosher status of the meat is not affected.&lt;/i&gt;

Is there some prohibition against caring enough about those laws to have the kashrus organization oversee them? Is not overseeing them negligent?

&lt;i&gt;I’m happy that more Jews are starting to care about keeping kosher.&lt;/i&gt;

You sure don&#039;t sound like it.

&lt;i&gt;Usually in these cases, we say “one who does the right thing for the wrong reasons, will eventually come to do the right thing for the right reasons”&lt;/i&gt;

Really? Chazal disagreed. Mitoch shelo lishma, ba lishma. And go to an Aish Seminar and tell them to stop showing the rational reasons and morality behind the other mitzvos.

And &quot;USUALLY&quot;? Do have any way of showing that is the case?

&lt;i&gt;However in this case, there is a danger that the term “kashrut” is merely a convenient label to push secular liberal concepts of food production and consumption.&lt;/i&gt;

Just because they are secular and liberal doesn&#039;t make them wrong.

&lt;i&gt;terms like “eco-kashrut” or “hechsher-tzedek” are as offensive to me as “kosher style”.&lt;/i&gt;

That&#039;s pathetic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off, that&#039;s pretty neat; to see some people in the Reform movement looking back to gain wisdom from the tradition to enrich their lives, even if it&#039;s not exactly halakhic it is at least a step towards respect which is refreshing.

As for your comment on the Orthodox learning a thing or two.....ab-so-freakin&#039;-lutely.  Now of course not all Orthodox, and I can only speak from my personal experience and limited amount of reading, but a good portion that I have interacted with have completely divorced kashrut from any kind of moral concern.  I would say this hold most true for organizations like the OU, which certified and stood behind Rubashkin during that whole balagan.  The amount fo kosher certified products in which there is tsar baalei chaim, bal tashchit, or unfair treatment of workers would probably shock most people.

Hopefully, by learning from each other, keeping an open mind, getting back to the source of Torah and trying to discover what God REALLY wants from us, we can bring more light into this world and help pave the way for a brighter future for everyone, Jews and non-Jews alike.]]></description>
