		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for stopping by...

At this time, the only SCOTUS precedent is the Lemon Test. Some courts apply it, some do not.

Lukumi follows the Lemon Test framework. That is, the law was &quot;targeting&quot; the religion of the Church, therefore it was subject to strict scrutiny.

Circumcision is different. Many folks perform circumcision for non-relgious reasons so the ban may not be seen as &quot;targeting&quot; a specific religion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Lemon test to which you refer in your post is fading out of popularity, as far as I know. 

 I think that a ban on circumcision would be held unconstitiutional under the Church of Lukumi Babalu analysis. There,  the court held that a seemingly secular law actually  targeted a particular religious practice and was therefore unconstitutional.  A ban on circumcision would also be seen as targeting a particular religious observance and would also fail.

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Rabbi Fink all the way.

And excuse me but &quot;if the Muslims scream, there will be a ban?&quot; What country are you living in? Because as a Muslim, oh, I&#039;d LOVE to live there. Because the way I see it, I can&#039;t cover my hair in public when I choose to (aside: I don&#039;t actually wear hijab anymore - my father made me stop on 9/11/2001 - but sometimes I cover my hair just as a cultural tic) without people treating me like I am (a) illiterate (b) stupid (c) a circus freak, or (d) the victim of abuse to be pitied and coddled. I can&#039;t fly on a plane without being subjected to &#039;random&#039; screening every single damn time. I am confronted every day with how so many people in this country think I&#039;m a second class citizen just because I don&#039;t happen to think that Jesus was the son of God. 

So get off your delusions. America has no problem discriminating against Muslims, so much so that putting the Constitution up for a popular vote is actually part of our national discourse about Muslims. (This refers specifically to whether muslims should be &#039;allowed&#039; to build a masjid near Ground Zero, and Newt Gingrich&#039;s asinine, emphasis on ass, remarks about how the government should use its powers to deprive Muslim citizens of property rights.)

Not central to the topic of the post - that is, this ban is dumb, violative of the civil liberties of every American parent to make decisions for his/her kids, and will never pass so it&#039;s a moot issue - but it&#039;s something I wanted to say anyway.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s against the law in this country to cut the genitals of baby girls.    Why could/would/should/might it not be against the law to cut boys?     If you are really educated on the anatomical, psychological and ethical reasons for not cutting girls, then the leap to not cutting boys is very short indeed.    
     Almost all of the people who promote circumcision have zero experience with a foreskin, either their own or someone elses.    I don&#039;t think they have a clue what a pleasure it is to have one, nor do they understand the risk from the complications that arise with cutting too tight, and lack of sensitivity in older men.    What really is their obsession with cutting off part of someone elses body, who cannot consent?     If you were to promote cutting off any other part of a person&#039;s body, people would react with horror.    How quickly people have forgotten that the practice was started in this country as a means to desensitize the penis.   It works well for that, but can&#039;t we at least begin to think in terms of letting men enjoy their bodies the way nature has evolved and not force surgical &quot;correction&quot; on something that is perfect in design just the way we are born?    
       It took a federal law to stop mutilation of girls, and no one complained.    Please give us equal treatment.

		<description><![CDATA[1) There are medical benefits to circumcision, including decreased transmission of HIV during sex, decreased incidence of penile squamous cell cancer and decrease risk of balanitis due to yeast infection.  Since most of these are rare in the first place, any decreased risk is also small but the recent evidence in the medical literature does show a health benefit.
2) Who cares?  We circumcise because God said so.
3) This law will never pass.  In the ranking system of political correctness, Muslims are currently at the top of the heap.  People who oppose discrimination against women and gays support militant Muslims who practice both.  If the Muslims scream, there will be no ban.  The trick will be for them to find a difference between Muslim and Jewish circumcisions and then set up a ban that affects only Jews, the way New Zealand figured out how to ban shechitah and not halal.

		<description><![CDATA[John, thanks for stopping by and sharing your thoughts.

Jews circumcise because we are commanded to do so in the Torah.

It is possible that there are side benefits to the procedure, but they are not the reason circumcision became part of Jewish law.

While it is unethical to perform any medical procedure that is not necessary, circumcision is considered &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; by our religion.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My uncircumcised father served in North Africa during World War II. He said sand granules would get under his foreskin and it was very painful. He speculated that both Jews and Arabs circumcise for this reason. An uncircumcised baby would have gone out of its mind with the pain. And so it became a part of their religion, since in older times, religious education was the only education most people ever got. But to continue this in modern America is unnecessary. There are drawbacks too, including loss of sensitivity by age 40, which was seldom reached in olden times. It is unethical to perform a routine circumcision that is not medically necessary (according to a ruling published by the Canadian Medical Ethics Association.) Although rare, some babies do die from the procedure.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Law - &lt;i&gt;Think this will pass the scrutiny level analysis required?
To sum up, HELL NO!&lt;/i&gt;

I agree. Not only because of scrutiny level, but because of the politics of not wanting to rile up certain segments of the population.

But my point still stands. A clever attorney could put together a case that might be upheld in the SC. After all, if there is precedent from the SDA cases (and I&#039;m not sure if there is), then couldn&#039;t a kal vachomer (argumentum a fortiori?) be used to show that if the state can &lt;i&gt;force&lt;/i&gt; a parent to take action to potentially cure (&quot;protect&quot; from harm) their child, then they surely can &lt;i&gt;prohibit&lt;/i&gt; a parent from taking action that is potentially harmful?

Shabbat Shalom all!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;Is a Ban on Circumcision Constitutional?&lt;/i&gt;

I think it all depends on how circumcision is defined. If it is defined primarily as &quot;religious ritual&quot;, then it would be protected. But if it is defined as &quot;cutting a part of your baby off&quot; and also determined to potentially be harmful to said baby, then perhaps not. If it were defined as such, the laws against child abuse/neglect definitely outweigh* the law permitted free exercise.

* Wasn&#039;t this determined in one of the Seventh Day Adventist cases a while back?]]></description>
