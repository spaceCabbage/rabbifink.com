		<description><![CDATA[Moshe, I&#039;m curious to learn more about your perspective and your decision (if you&#039;ve made one). I&#039;m beginning a project exploring this very conflict, and if we could discuss offline the consideration between maintaining your own personal convictions vs. maintaining your family&#039;s tradition, I would be very appreciative of your time.

Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Almost all practicing Jews have attended circumcisions (brit milah).   We all know exactly what it looks like, and sounds like.

We (males anyway) also know that we have zero memory of our own circumcisions.  We&#039;ve been doing this for thousands of years.  We&#039;ve done it in times of religious persecution, when circumcising a baby boy was punishable by death. 

Also, I have personally witnessed grown men being circumcised.  It is an obligation for a male to be circumcised to be considered part of the Jewish people.

You obviously have no clue about our people, if you think that we haven&#039;t watched the procedure done on babies, or that &quot;no grown man would ever&quot; agree to a circumcision.

I am very thankful to the King of the Universe that whackos like you are no more than the tiniest fraction of voting Americans.  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ The Jewish tradition fully supports the notion that sex with a circumcised penis is less pleasurable for both the man and the women than that of the natural member. First, there is a Midrash story of Dina, Jacob&#039;s daughter, who ran away from her family to fornicate with Shekhem. According to this story, she couldn&#039;t tear herself away from him because she enjoyed sex with his uncut penis. Next, Maimonedies, who was a physician by profession, explicitly wrote that the purpose of circumcision was to reduce sexual pleasure to discourage excessive engagement in sexual activity. Finally, there is Rabbi Huna in the Mishna who states, &quot;niveles min ha-&#039;arel kashe lifrosh,&quot; she who fornicates with an uncircumcised man, it is difficult for her separate (from that man) and stop. In a more general way, the idea of circumcision in the Jewish tradition is to separate the man from his animal self so that his godly spiritual nature would overcome his mere animal instinct.

This is not, in and of itself a reason not to circumcise, as the limiting of sexual pleasure seems to be in congruence with the Jewish (and Muslim) notion that man, in the guise of the Jew (or Muslim), should separate himself from his animal nature and assume a more godly and spiritual state of being in which he controls, limits, and sublimates his animal instincts. But it also suggests that for people without this religious imperative, there is no reason to do it.

But I do know this, I have never met an uncircumcised man who would ever being willing to part with his foreskin. They find it incomprehensible that a piece of their penis should be cut, and they always state that the foreskin is the best part of their &quot;organ.&quot; The man who engages in sexual activity without experiencing the inside of the foreskin rubbing against the glans of the penis, is missing out on what they would regard as the most pleasurable aspect of sexual activity. 

But then, there is also Rashi&#039;s commentary in which it is asked, why does the beginning of the book of Exodus, have the title &quot;Names&quot; in Hebrew?  And so it begins, &quot;These are the names...&quot;  Rashi asks, &quot;Why does this book begin this way?&quot; and then concludes that the Jews (or Hebrews) in Egypt were sinners and didn&#039;t follow the commandments of the Torah.  That God redeemed them from Egypt because they kept two commandments, they kept their original, what we could call  today, &quot;Jewish identified&quot; names, and they observed the commandment of circumcision. 

Most Jews, even those who know nothing of the Jewish tradition or Jewish religous practice, do the circ based, often unconsciously, on this commentary by Rashi.  There is nothing particularly &quot;Orthodox&quot; about circumcision for virtually all people of Jewish descent have practiced it until very recently.  I am so conflicted on this...  I do think, however, that most of the formally frum will continue to do it to their sons...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From a very freedom conscious American,
&quot;I can&#039;t even imagine what it would be like to live in a world where those crazy crazy, crazy hippies (or those of us from Europe) got their way.
Dames would be able to vote, Negros could be Free to sit in the front of the bus or complain that scarring on their backs are not OK, I couldn&#039;t beat my youngins with a switch if they gave me sass that they would not work for me, shoot MY dawg and animals for fun or tell my wife to obey me and do her job and be my screwing doll. What kind of world would this be?
why Government must interfere to protect and regulate all those fun things we used to do on the weak? because it wants to be a Government nanny?
Why don&#039;t they mind their OWN business?
Terrible, evil hippies indeed.&quot;

And we, normal average folk from Europe (I am from Norway living in DC) are wondering what kind of snake oil medicine your doctors made you swallow -since Dr. Harvey Kelløgg who started this Jewish copycat- to make you sexually mutilate your children? Because YOUR doctors used to cut American girls too with parents consent until 1996

What about the religious persecution of the U.S. against those whose Religion beliefs dictate that they circumcise their daughters?? Those people bring their daughters abroad to be circumcised. There are also people who believe in human sacrifice, but they are not allowed BY LAW to practice their beliefs because they law steps in when your beliefs IMPACT another human beings BODY. Whatever happened to the separation of Church from State and State&#039;s duty to protect citizens from Church burnings, stonings, etc? ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ The very nature of circumcision is requirement.  The child has no choice in the matter when someone else decides for the child.  If you circumcise without the child&#039;s consent it is essentially a requirement and forced... mandatory.

You do know that tattooing a child is considered illegal, right?  You can not even put a knife to the genitals of an underage girl for any reason whatsoever without risking a prison sentence.  

Have you ever thought that those Orthodox Jewish children may be brainwashed into believing everything they&#039;re told?  The same can be said about other religions.  Christians believe that people can walk on water and change water to wine.  Does that make it factual?  ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[this is rich.  &quot;I&#039;m an RN so i KNOW this things is really terrible&quot;.  guess they dont teach debate in nursing school.

I have seen many circumcisions. probably more than you will ever see in your life RN.  and my wife is an RN and she agrees with me.

There, now that we have sufficiently dealt with all of your &quot;convincing evidence&quot;, we can have a real discussion.

its a legal analysis. constitutional. not how you feel.

if it was about how you feel or the rights of children, then see my first post, you legally be undoing a tremendous amount of law.  think about it... 

I am The Law..

		<description><![CDATA[Circumcision is less painful, less traumatic, and safer if performed on an adult, with the consent of the owner of the penis.

It&#039;s less painful because a baby&#039;s foreskin has to be ripped from the head of the penis like a fingernail, because babies are more sensitive to pain than adults, and because an adult can be anesthetized and given strong pain medication, which could kill a baby.  It&#039;s less traumatic because an adult understands what&#039;s going on and why, and especially because the adult consented to the procedure.  It&#039;s safer because it takes very little blood loss for a newborn to bleed to death, and bleeding is one of the primary risks of a circumcision.

There is simply no reason to perform this cosmetic, non-therapeutic surgery on someone who cannot consent to it.  When every national health organization in the world says that circumcision is a cosmetic, non-therapeutic procedure and that it is unnecessary, we need to recognize that no one has the right to perform it on a person who cannot consent to it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ Give me a break!  

It should not be considered a fundamental &quot;right&quot; for any parent!  

No parent should be allowed to decide, especially when it is deemed medically unnecessary, to remove any normal, healthy, functioning part of their childs&#039; penis!  EVER!

		<description><![CDATA[You present such a ridiculous argument.  Religion does not make it okay, nor should it be an excuse to have it done on any child.  As a registered nurse I have seen firsthand what circumcisions are really like, and believe me they are not at all the &quot;simple&quot; procedure people make them out to be.  

I too was once of the belief that it was what every one  did, and was of no big deal.  All the men in my family had it done, and no one ever gave it much thought.  All of that changed when I saw one performed when I was a nursing student.  It was the most horrible thing I had ever witnessed.  I have since made it my goal to educate people about circumcision.

Research has demonstrated that it is not cleaner, does not decrease the liklihood of any disease or infection, and is not a necessary procedure.  Why do people consider it okay to cut off a normal, healthy functioning part of a male&#039;s sexual organ?  Why the hell can&#039;t people just leave it alone?  

Male circumcision makes as much sense as female circumcision.  There are no benefits to it,  and it is very painful for the child.  There are many real risks involved, as with any surgical procedure.  And believe it or not, many babies have died from infection and/or hemmorhaging after the procedure.

No grown man would ever lay down on an exam table and agree to have any part of the skin on his penis cut off while wide awake, yet they will have their child do it.  It should never be the decision of the parents.  The penis belongs to the child, therefore it should be his decision! 

Anyone who believes that circumcision is okay should be forced to watch a real one, and made to listen to the child&#039;s heart wrenching screams.

It is the year 2011, people need to step out of the Goddamn dark ages, and stop using religious beliefs to perform barbaric procedures on innocent babies.

		<description><![CDATA[  My son is intact (not circumcised) because his foreskin has several functions and a rightful owner. I support a ban on non therapeutic circumcision of minors. It&#039;s not about taking religious or parental rights away from parents, it&#039;s about protecting a childs right to bodily integrity. Doctors should First Do No Harm and not be soliciting circumcision to parents of healthy children, instead parents should be taught the functions and purpose of the foreskin and how to care properly for their intact sons, which is really very simple. Many myths myths perpetuate this archaic practice of cutting childrens genitals. The FGM law protects female childrens genital integrity, why are males being denied equal protection of the law?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Michael:

Thank you for stopping by and providing your thoughts.

I am not sure what is bothering you. No one here is saying circumcision should be required. No one is saying secular people should circumcise.

What is being said is that nearly all Orthodox Jews have Orthodox Jewish children who appreciate their parents performing the circumcision on them when they did not have a choice. The Intactivists wrongly assume that the result would be different if the parent did not choose the circumcision for the child. It would not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If circumcision is a religious freedom that is required by &quot;The Law&quot; then why is it embraced by a huge chunk of the American population?  A dividing line needs to be drawn between Orthodox Judaism and secular society.  When one says that it is necessary a disclaimer needs to be given to put the requirement in perspective.  To say that circumcision is not a choice is deceptive.  It is not a choice for Orthodox Jews but it NEEDS to be a choice for non-Orthodox Jews in America.  Why must religion always trump secular society?  No one would force a non-Orthodox Jewish man to get a circumcision so why force a non-Orthodox Jewish baby boy to get a circumcision?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was raised as a Modern Orthodox Jew, and currently consider myself Atheist--though I still consider myself culturally Jewish (similar to Mordecai Kaplan&#039;s definition of a Jew, except I consider Reconstructionism as a whole to be too minimalistic for my own good).

In my sojourns, I have encountered several like-minded Jews and Catholics who regret their circumcisions and have considered getting their foreskins reattached (some surgical procedure).  Now even in my most self-hating moments, I&#039;ve never taken it so far to regret having been circumcised.  I don&#039;t regret it any more than I regret being Bar Mitzvahed. any more than I regret the size of my nose, any more than I regret having received a Jewish education, and any more than I regret having a Jewish name (Moshe Yoseph ben Shmuel Aharon).  I don&#039;t regret any of it: I may have moved away from being a practicing Jew, but I don&#039;t regret for one second that I was one to begin with.

Will my kids be circumcised?  I have been turning this one over.  Right now, I don&#039;t know that I will raise my kids Jewish.  I will teach them about their Jewish heritage, and if they decide to be Jewish, I will encourage it.  But if they decide to be something else, as long as it doesn&#039;t involve sacrificing babies or something like that, I will encourage it just as much.  Right now, the only reason I can think of to circumcise him and give him a Jewish name is to make the family happy.  I haven&#039;t read too compelling an argument of any real dangers of circumcision (though metzitza is OUT OF THE QUESTION!), so as of now, I say why not.  But understand that my reasons would be more for the family than for the perpetuation of the Bris between Avraham and Hashem.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve read the law. It&#039;s similar.  With regard to genital cutting on a healthy female minor, no exception shall be given to the reasons given by the child&#039;s parents.  That&#039;s what this proposal says for male minors.

That law is constitutional, as this proposal would be.  The First Amendment right perceived to be violated here is an individual right to freedom of (and from) religion.  No one has the right to practice his or her religion on the body of a non-consenting person.  As in the hoop-jumping example in this blog post, permitting circumcision as a valid parental right requires an assumption that the child will want it.  If he doesn&#039;t, the argument falls apart. That&#039;s true even if only one child would reject it.

Think about it differently: do parents have the right to dictate the religion their child follows until the end of his life?  If not, then the parental right to raise children in their religion is not absolute.  Children must be free to reject their parents&#039; beliefs when they become independent.  Circumcision is permanent and can&#039;t be rejected once it&#039;s imposed.

As others have pointed out, your list fails.  As you later accept in passing, parental rights are not absolute.  Children have a negative right to be free from harm that trumps the non-absolute parental right to raise children within a religion.  Statutory rape laws protect children from harm.  (Note: these laws are necessarily over-protective than under-protective.  There is valid precedence for caution.)  Child labor laws protect children from harm.  Laws requiring parents to educate their children protects the children from harm.

In the case of genital cutting, circumcision is objective harm.  Cutting and removal of healthy tissue and nerve endings, risk of infection and further complications, and scarring are all forms of harm.  Non-therapeutic genital cutting on a non-consenting individual may - should - be prohibited because it is harm.  Gender is irrelevant if equal protection laws are to mean anything.  All men are created equal, except for the healthy genitals of male minors at his parents&#039; discretion?  Nonsense.  All individuals have the right to be free from harm to which they do not consent, even if their lack of consent is only because they can&#039;t yet say &quot;I want to be circumcised.&quot;  To assume they would want to be circumcised because a majority would is merely reaching for the desired conclusion by omitting what is detrimental to one&#039;s argument.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[the 1996 law outlawing FGC is not akin to this.

the 4th amendment is a search and seizure amendment.  (though you might want to look into the &quot;takings of private property&quot; clause of the 5th LOL).

while not absolute the care of the child is ONLY overridden when not to do so puts the childs life in danger.  Blood transfusions and medical intervention in life saving conditions.  again, not even close to this case...

all these &quot;legal arguments&quot;, and i use the term very loosely, fall flat...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;it is not an elective surgery foisted upon an unsuspecting youth who is likely to regret or will even possibly regret the procedure, thus rendering it barbaric.&quot;You have talked yourself from a high probability to a certainty, but that does not make it a certainty. Some proportion of boys born into Orthodoxy will grow up to be men who are other than Orthodox, and who will resent what has been done to them. Even if those who resent it are a small minority, the interests of minorities have to be considered.

@The Law: 1st amendment freedom to practise religion is not absolute, especially when the protection of children is involved. The law can force Jehovah&#039;s Witness parents to allow their children to have blood transfusions (it is now done very smoothly by the legal fiction they become wards of the state for as long as it takes, that JW parents accept), and Christian Scientists to allow their children to be given conventional medicine.  The 4th amendment guarantees &quot;The right of the people to be secure in their persons … against unreasonable … seizures&quot; and a grown man may well deem the loss of his foreskin &quot;an unreasonable seizure&quot;.  I&#039;m surprised you mention the 14th amendment, when all female genital cutting, no matter how minor (and hence regardless of harmlessness), is already outlawed, with religion and cultural reasons specifically not exempted. The fallacy of the rest of your case is that this is not about giving rights to children, but to the men they will grow up to be, to decide for themselves what part of their own genitals they keep or have cut off.]]></description>

The 4th amendment guarantees &#8220;The right of the people to be secure in their persons … against unreasonable … seizures&#8221; and a grown man may well deem the loss of his foreskin &#8220;an unreasonable seizure&#8221;.  I&#8217;m surprised you mention the 14th amendment, when all female genital cutting, no matter how minor (and hence regardless of harmlessness), is already outlawed, with religion and cultural reasons specifically not exempted. The fallacy of the rest of your case is that this is not about giving rights to children, but to the men they will grow up to be, to decide for themselves what part of their own genitals they keep or have cut off.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Protecting children&#039;s health is considered a legitimate state interest. The CDC has determined that their is no connection between vaccines and autism. You can believe them or not but that&#039;s what they say. Likewise, female circumcision except in the mildest forms, have proven well evidenced health hazards. 

Circumcision has no proven adverse effects except for some very infrequent risks inherent to any invasive procedure. Thus the state has no compelling interest.  
Metziza B&#039;peh, however, which has some clearly documented health risks, could be more feasibly banned, at least in theory. In practice it will not happen due to the power of public sentiment. 

Abortion is entirely separate issue having nothing to do with child rights- as the famous supreme court decision of Roe v. Wade clearly states, life for all legal purposes begins at birth, beforehand it is classified as potential life and it is the state&#039;s interest in potential life and not fetal rights that is weighed against the pregnant woman&#039;s autonomy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Failing to vaccinate a child, for instance, puts the health of that child in jeopardy. Similarly, statuatory rape puts the physical and mental health of the child in jeopardy.&quot;

this is &quot;your&quot; spin.  maybe getting vaccines cause autism. maybe acquired immunity through natural exposure would be better and safer.  (in fact the reason we immunize is b/c its safer for those around us,not b/c its safer for the child.  we have an interest in not having kids with communicable diseases out in public to protect the public.  but i digress.) as far as stat rape laws, a 15 year old having sex with an 18 year old (highschool sophmore and highschool senior), that puts the 15 year old in mental and physical  jeopardy, but if the older participant was a junior (17) it doesnt?  

your argument falls short...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Law -

Although I agree that &quot;intactivists&quot; should examine whether what they want to do is illegal, your comparisons fall short. Failing to vaccinate a child, for instance, puts the health of that child in jeopardy. Similarly, statuatory rape puts the physical and mental health of the child in jeopardy. 

Failing to circumcise a child does not physically endanger the child (assuming he is taught proper cleanliness habits). I suppose there could be some mental harm if the boy is teased in the restroom or locker room.

I&#039;m not advocating for a circumcision ban, by the way. I think the &quot;inactivists&quot; should mind their own business. I just don&#039;t think we help our cause by making false analogies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These &quot;inactivists&quot; are missing a major point.  When you want to change the status quo and take away a fundamental right, there is a legal analysis that needs to happen to ensure that the gov. has the right to do so.  In this case there must be a compelling gov.interest of the highest caliber.  (ie strict scrutiny analysis).

But for consistency sake lets let these &quot;inactivists&quot; stand firm on their desire to override the 1st and 14th amendments and strip parents of their rights and give all rights to children.

let go through the list of things that will need to change in SF:

1) abortion/partial birth abortion - children have rights, sorry mom..

2) vaccinations - children can always get them later - thanks anyway jonas salk

3) school attendance - ill go to school if and when i want to

4) statutory rape laws - children have the right to choose when to have sex and with whom...

5) child labor laws - kids can work, they got small hands that can get places into an engine that adults cant, right?

you get the idea...

we dont give kids the right to choose on things because, well, they are children, and for lack of a better term, they are dumb. (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/teenage-brain-a-work-in-progress-fact-sheet/index.shtml)  we make decisions for them all the time.

And for those that argue that this is akin to the federal ban on FGM, you are sadly mistaken, read the law and you will see that it is not similar.  (though im not sure that law is exactly constitutional either)]]></description>
