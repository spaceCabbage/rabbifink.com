		<description><![CDATA[After reading Hush, I think my story need not be told, for it is already written.
(I had been attempting to write my memories on my blog, testing the waters with a minimal readership...and I had been disappointed with the reactions. I might abandon the project now...we&#039;ll see.)
There are so many of us out there, so many like this woman, suffering in silence in order to protect those we love.
I understand why she will not speak out, I understand why she cannot.
There is no room for judgement here, only love and support for those who have seen hell and lived to bring a bit of heaven into painfully mended lives.
And she&#039;s right, the true heroes are the ones who deal with the adult children curled up in fear in their bedrooms with gentle, safe and steady hands.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you E. Fink.

Thank you HaKohen for your thoughtful responses. I accept your differentiation of &quot;baggage&quot; from &quot;damaged goods&quot;. I was using the language of the author of the post above. I suppose we all have &quot;baggage&quot; and then some of us have &quot;ubber baggage&quot;.

And yes, those of us who could not share the abuse with an authority figure, for whatever reason, while we were abused as children or teenagers, are left with even more baggage as a result. Your daughter is very fortunate to have an excellent parent like you - it is very likely to make all the difference in her having an ability to cope in her adult life.

Although I know in my mind certain facts - like those you mentioned about still being worthy of friends and a good life, but our early internal programming often takes control of the steering, and it is very difficult to overcome this. It&#039;s a struggle, and for some of us more than others.

And I suppose &quot;the jury is still out&quot; as you say, but in reality, half my life is over and a good life is not very probable at this point. I&#039;m still open to the idea at times, but hope is hard to come by now. Mostly I just take it one day at a time, trying to get through each day and trying not to think about my life as a whole.

Thank you again for your kind words.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Maybe she is worried. But maybe she is also worried about the reaction of the community. I think this what she was saying in her note, that she is forced into silence for fear of the unfair reaction to her and her other family (excluding the brother).

On a side note, I don&#039;t think it is fair to expect a sister to be able to do that to her brother or family. It is different when the abuser is a rabbi, friend or even an uncle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just to clarify: It seems from what was written that the victim was abuse by her brother.Since she mentions that her parents do not know what happened to her I am left wondering what happened to her brother. Is she not worried that he will potentially abuse another family member whether spouse, child, niece or someone else? Does he live in close proximity with children? Should he? 

Those of us who have bee abused have the burden not only of healing ourselves but making sure that our abusers do not find more victims. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[By the way, I have a teenage daughter that was sexually molested so I do have what to say.  she is, thank G-d, doing remarkably well.  It is not a taboo topic between us, and she is determined to help others that have similarly been abused.   She is perceptive way beyond her years, and I have given her permission to tell any of her friends if she perceives the time is right.  She knows some of her friends couldn&#039;t handle it and they don&#039;t know.  A few do, including one that was in an even worst situation.
This is no doubt something that Rachel and the guest poster did not have the benefit of, this validation that they are still worthy of friends and a life full of nachas.   From a halachic standpoint, my daughter is unable to marry a Kohen.  As for others, anyone that would reject her for having suffered through something beyond her control and not recognizing her amazing resilience is not good enough for her anyway.  Good Shabbos!

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for writing and sharing your story with us, and what you have learned from it.

You speak about not judging others. So I will tell you a little about my story, and hope you will not judge me.

I, too, was abused. But not sexually abused. It was at the hands of a parent, not a sibling.

But my life does not have the happy result that yours does. I am over 40 and have never been married. I am &quot;damaged goods&quot; and don’t need anyone else to point it out or talk about it on blogs or in articles, I know it. I have a lot of the baggage that comes along with having been abused. The abuse took it&#039;s toll on me before I was able to get married to an unsuspecting young man. At this point in my life many people know or suspect that &quot;something is not right, there is a reason this girl has never been married...&quot; They are right, there is a reason.

And here is where your point about judgment comes in. We are ALL damaged goods to one extent or another. Suffering is part of being human. It is rare for a human being to not have suffered at all in their lifetime. And just as people are different in their physical sensitivities, people are different in their emotional sensitivities. Some people are more hurt, or “damaged” by the abuse than others. Some people are even more affected or “damaged” by difficulties that are NOT abuse than others are to abuse (trauma, for example). And the “damage” that we all carry manifests itself in different ways. In some people it manifests in their need to look impeccable and perfectly stylish at all times. In others it manifests in their inability to focus on their clothing, how they are dressed, or how they appear in public. And the examples go on and on. The point is – while you ask others not to judge those who were sexually abused, and not look at those who were sexually abused as “damaged goods” – I ask you to look at everyone as “damaged goods”, and realize that everyone has “pekelach” and burdens that they carry which affect their lives in various ways.

So, the next time you see someone who is stands out in some way, or is not put together, or does not conform in some way or another to social norms, when your mind starts to judge “what is wrong with her/him” – stop – and remember how you asked us not to judge you or others who have been sexually abused. Please remember to extend the same reserving of judgment towards them. And when you hear your friends judging or talking down about someone, remind your friends that they never know what that person who they are looking down at, judging, or calling “damaged” went through. That perhaps just having stayed alive and living through every day was more of an act of gavrus than they ever could have imagined. And maybe even by befriending that person you could learn a thing or two about being strong, and coping with “the damage.”

No one wants to be “damaged goods”. But the fact is that most of us are. Some of us have it written on our foreheads clearer than others. And some of us are able to fool the world for longer. As a popular and successful frum woman, your opinions matter to people. So remind people, as much as possible, not to judge others. Anyone. Because for all anyone knows, everyone and anyone they see could have been living through the same gehenom you did. Even if it seems like “they made their own bed” by “being too picky” in shidduchim, or even if they are wealthy and seem to have no problems, or even if it seems like they care too much about something you think is trivial, or don’t care enough about something that you think is important – give them the benefit of the doubt that they are coping as best as they can with the struggles that life is handing them, and which you likely know nothing about.

Thank you again for writing and sharing your story with us, and what you have learned from it so far. It is clear that you will use your pain from what you went through, and your sensitivity to these issues towards helping others.

<p>But my life does not have the happy result that yours does. I am over 40 and have never been married. I am &#8220;damaged goods&#8221; and don’t need anyone else to point it out or talk about it on blogs or in articles, I know it. I have a lot of the baggage that comes along with having been abused. The abuse took it&#8217;s toll on me before I was able to get married to an unsuspecting young man. At this point in my life many people know or suspect that &#8220;something is not right, there is a reason this girl has never been married&#8230;&#8221; They are right, there is a reason.</p>
<p>And here is where your point about judgment comes in. We are ALL damaged goods to one extent or another. Suffering is part of being human. It is rare for a human being to not have suffered at all in their lifetime. And just as people are different in their physical sensitivities, people are different in their emotional sensitivities. Some people are more hurt, or “damaged” by the abuse than others. Some people are even more affected or “damaged” by difficulties that are NOT abuse than others are to abuse (trauma, for example). And the “damage” that we all carry manifests itself in different ways. In some people it manifests in their need to look impeccable and perfectly stylish at all times. In others it manifests in their inability to focus on their clothing, how they are dressed, or how they appear in public. And the examples go on and on. The point is – while you ask others not to judge those who were sexually abused, and not look at those who were sexually abused as “damaged goods” – I ask you to look at everyone as “damaged goods”, and realize that everyone has “pekelach” and burdens that they carry which affect their lives in various ways.</p>
<p>So, the next time you see someone who is stands out in some way, or is not put together, or does not conform in some way or another to social norms, when your mind starts to judge “what is wrong with her/him” – stop – and remember how you asked us not to judge you or others who have been sexually abused. Please remember to extend the same reserving of judgment towards them. And when you hear your friends judging or talking down about someone, remind your friends that they never know what that person who they are looking down at, judging, or calling “damaged” went through. That perhaps just having stayed alive and living through every day was more of an act of gavrus than they ever could have imagined. And maybe even by befriending that person you could learn a thing or two about being strong, and coping with “the damage.”</p>
<p>No one wants to be “damaged goods”. But the fact is that most of us are. Some of us have it written on our foreheads clearer than others. And some of us are able to fool the world for longer. As a popular and successful frum woman, your opinions matter to people. So remind people, as much as possible, not to judge others. Anyone. Because for all anyone knows, everyone and anyone they see could have been living through the same gehenom you did. Even if it seems like “they made their own bed” by “being too picky” in shidduchim, or even if they are wealthy and seem to have no problems, or even if it seems like they care too much about something you think is trivial, or don’t care enough about something that you think is important – give them the benefit of the doubt that they are coping as best as they can with the struggles that life is handing them, and which you likely know nothing about.</p>
<p>Thank you again for writing and sharing your story with us, and what you have learned from it so far. It is clear that you will use your pain from what you went through, and your sensitivity to these issues towards helping others.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[First, kol hakaovod lach for speaking up in this forum. You enhance the conversation and the debate. Thank you.
Second, I am doing what I can: I teach my children the proper English (and Hebrew for the time spent in Israel) words for all their body parts, and I USE those words, consistently. I witnessed abuse when I was little, and PART of the problem that led to not telling my parents was a stunted vocabulary.
 Another part was not having comfort in discussing  issues that were uncomfortable, &quot;untzanua&quot;. 
Starting when they are little, we tell our kids lots about reproductive issues, including sex. It is important for this to be matter of fact, an everyday part of life, just like we talk about the skeleton, and the lungs, and what they do, and other animals&#039; biology, we talk about reproduction. 
The last part was not having a constant dialogue with my parents about everything. 
This I am not always great with when it comes to the male offspring, but my husband is amazing. 

Now, for the mussar part. 
What are you (the author, and all yeshivish and chassidish people who decry abuse) doing to prevent this?
Do you use the proper language? Do you seize every opportunity to talk about sex and love -  about boundaries and abuse or are you embarrassed, because, well, too many people are around, because your younger kids are around. Do you put it off until later? How much later do you get to it? What are we telling our kids when we find it difficult to talk about their concerns? That maybe they should be bashful about telling you?
I cannot tell you all that I have seen and heard about people who want to protect their kids. It makes me cry.
I want to protect my kids too, but not in some fake way, where everybody is a child and &quot;innocent&quot; until the day they get married, when they turn into ? 
You want your velt to accept you with open arms. You like being a full member of your velt. 
I want to know, what are you doing to protest what your velt is doing to ensure that your kids don&#039;t have the words to tell before it is too late? Why accept this way of raising aidel maidels (and yingels) if it is part of the problem?
(By the way, as far as I can see, the embarrassment never ends. I have been to parent meetings about keeping our children safe, where the rabbeim, and psychologists were clearly not comfortable speaking openly. Everybody in the room had been sexually active at least fourteen years and nine months. What is up with that?)
I have not proofread, or thought too carefully, for if I do, I will be ashamed to post and hurt your feelings, but you yourself might say this isn&#039;t about your feelings, it is about prevention and acceptance. 
Again, Kol Hakavod
