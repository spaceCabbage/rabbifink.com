		<description><![CDATA[The ad itseld does not bother me, it&#039;s the seemingly young girl featured in it that does. Who cares if Kobe Bryant stars in it being the &quot;role model&quot; he is- it&#039;s the young girl that is more influential to young people.  I found that to be disturbing. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is a test for obscenity: (a) whether &#039;the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

To include violent video games in this test is nearly impossible. The SCOTUS would need to devise a new test to include violent video games.

Is it possible they might? Sure. But there is no precedent.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I may be missing the point. But if &quot;obscene&quot; isn&#039;t defined anywhere in law, what is to stop government from declaring &quot;lifelike virtual extreme violence&quot; to be obscene? Similar to the way computer-generated child pornography has been (or will?) be defined as obscene?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Your confusing two things. Just because there is lack of consent does not mean that a photos or video can be censored. Video of a rape is (arguably) not censored and there is no consent there. Consent is irrelevant to the constitutional analysis.

In order for censorship of pornography to pass strict scrutiny (the test for determining whether a law is constitutional if it prohibits speech) the censored content must be obscene.

There is no existing exception to the 1st amendment that would permit censorship of violent material.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;.. and refers to things like Child Pornography.&lt;/i&gt;

But child pornography is not a case of indecency, it&#039;s a case of lack of [legal] consent. There is no discernible difference between an image of a 17 year 364 day old and that of an 18 year old, yet under the law, there is a huge difference. And the difference is the consent required that cannot be given by a minor, not the indecent or obscene image itself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;i&gt;What would stop government from declaring certain violence to be “indecent” and use the existing rules of censorship?&lt;/i&gt;

There aren&#039;t really any! Legal censorship is very rare.

Ratings are permitted. But censoring completely requires &quot;Obscenity&quot; is a tough term to define (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity) but it is more than indecency and refers to things like Child Pornography.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t support government censoring any of this stuff. But I have a question. Does anyone have a reasonable reason why government should be permitted to censor &quot;indecent&quot; material (such as pornography), yet not be permitted to censor violence.
