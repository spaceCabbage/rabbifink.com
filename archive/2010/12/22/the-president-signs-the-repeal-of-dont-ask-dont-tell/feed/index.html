		<description><![CDATA[I think everybody is taking the wrong angle in assessing this law. I&#039;m all for gay rights. As an American I think they should be treated equally in everything and sexual preference shouldn&#039;t make a difference. However, this is not a gay rights question. This is a national security question. When it comes to the army I don&#039;t  care about rights. I care about keeping our country safe. This law should not have been about allowing gays to serve in the military it should be a question of whether that is what is best for our soldiers. I think without being in the army it is hard for us to say that this law should have passed. We don&#039;t know what the service is like and to say that the law should have been repealed long ago is really not fair for you to say considering that your knowledge of the army, like mine, is deficient. I am not saying that it should not have been repealed only that we have to look at what is best for the army not what is best for the gays. That being the case I think for non-military people to pass judgment on the law, or for that matter write the law is a mistake. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like how you didn&#039;t mention halacha in this post as it is completely irrelevant to the discussion. 

After the Pres. signed this into law I was happy and gay, having witnessed first hand a civilizations moral and social progression by removing one of the worst examples of baseless discrimination that can be found. 

Orthox Jews everywhere should be proud that Sen. Joe Lieberman was one of the leading voices in getting this repeal passed. ]]></description>
