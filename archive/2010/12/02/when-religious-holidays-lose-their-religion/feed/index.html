		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still trying to find the source that it was a custom in the time of the Talmud. Doesn&#039;t it say that &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; guy always kept his head covered? Seems like it became a custom &lt;b&gt;after&lt;/b&gt; Talmudic times, and was then codified into law later. Much later, like AFTER the Rishonim. Does Rambam say you have to cover your head all the time, or just during tefillah?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That wikipedia article doesn&#039;t support your thesis. In fact it explicitly says something close to the opposite -

&lt;i&gt;Originally, a head covering at other times for males was a custom, but it has since taken on &quot;the force of law&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

And none of the sources listed there indicate that headcovering was universal for men in post-temple times, certainly outside of during prayer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Head covering for every male is for the Talmud.

There may be some examples, but I think it is a flaw in our observance if we place the same level of credence on those practices as we do that which is mandated by the Talmud. If you&#039;ve been listening to the Rambam class, you know that the Talmud was an attempt to codify &quot;Torah SheBaal Peh&quot; - the rules for performing mitzvos that were given at Sinai. That process ended with the closing of the Talmud.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[But there &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; certain elements that have ever so slowly entered since then and have become essential. Head-covering for every male, for example. Or perhaps the tallit during davening. And there are probably plenty more examples.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have toyed with that idea. I don&#039;t think it is true. The practice of non-Temple Centric Judaims was codified at a point in history, by those with the authority to make it so. Those are the essential elements for us. We can&#039;t undo them and nothing that we add on can approach that level of &quot;essentialism&quot;. If they are forgotten or discarded, it is not a big deal...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[E. Fink - &lt;i&gt;I think it is important to keep that in perspective so as to not allow the non-essential elements of the holidays usurp the true meaning of the holidays.&lt;/i&gt;

I&#039;m not sure if some of the &quot;true meaning&quot; parts of the holidays are things that were considered &quot;non-essential elements&quot; a hundred, a thousand, or two thousand years ago. In other words, I wonder if the holidays and their elements with true meaning also evolve with time?]]></description>
