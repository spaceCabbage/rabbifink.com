		<description><![CDATA[What is wrong with Nigeria? This is what expatriated Nigerians ask as many of their websites attest. Is it the Muslim violence? The continuance of animism and primitive beliefs? The oil companies? Nigerian Christianity?

Christian missionaries to Nigeria in the late 19th century campaigned against primitive witchcraft beliefs; hopefully, there was some success: elsewhere in Africa, the same atrocities are committed in even greater numbers. Most definitely, animist Nigerian Christianity is not &quot;Christianity.&quot;

Evangelical Pentecostal Christianity, (which ironically, it seems, is a better friend to Israel than Obama) ) has had elements of its beliefs incorporated and overlaid on top of primitive animism in Nigeria. It must carefully view who it promotes and funds and not give credence to charlatans like Helen Ukpabio. The exposure of the blasphemous &quot;Christians,&quot; who defraud the community and cause children to horribly suffer and die, should energize the world Christian community, especially the Pentacostals, to condemn the beliefs and practices of those like Helen Ukpabio.

I don&#039;t personally believe in the Pentacostal emphasis on the &quot;war&quot; between God and Satan, and in fact I see a lot of similarity between it and Islam, but Pentacostalism seems to have curbed its dogma somewhat and lives within our laws. Still, its pretty hard to stomach the &quot;prosperity preachers.&quot;

On the other hand, the secular hand, the argument that poverty and lack of education is the real cause of violence and extremism has been made before.

See: http://www.marxist.com/witchcraft-nigeria-peoples-minds.htm

I don&#039;t think so. Torah teaches that disobedience to G-d&#039;s commandments is the cause of suffering. Obedience brings peace and prosperity!

Education, or should I say &quot;re-education&quot; is the Marxist, g-dless answer. Marxists assume any opposition to their beliefs is a manifestation of mental illness and from them came  the list of phobias one can accuse any opponent with, a real Saul Alinsky tactic. He was the man who dedicated his book, &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot; to Lucifer. Funny that. Lucifer is a Latin term. If Alinsky had chosen Satan, that would have been much more appropriate given Alinsky&#039;s main tactic is to accuse.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Take up the White Man&#039;s burden--
Ye dare not stoop to less--
Nor call too loud on Freedom
To cloke your weariness;
By all ye cry or whisper,
By all ye leave or do,
The silent, sullen peoples
Shall weigh your gods and you.

-Rudyard Kipling]]></description>
