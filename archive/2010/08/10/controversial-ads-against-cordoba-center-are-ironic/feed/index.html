		<description><![CDATA[There are plenty of bigots fueling this fire. That does not mean that all those opposed to the center are bigots.

I do think that a lot of the opposition is due to irrational fear of anything and everything Muslim and further is a wasted opportunity to bolster moderate Islam.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed. And that is why I think the center should be allowed, despite my misgivings. I would also support the rights of the American Nazi Party to march in Skokie, IL. That does not mean there are not good reasons to be opposed to the center, or that one is a bigot for not taking everything the group behind center says at face value.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The proposed building is owned by Silverstein Properties.  They get to choose who they want as tenants.  If they think that they will attract more business and rentals with a mosque there, they will put one in - if not, not.

All those opposed to building a mosque there are doing the right thing by airing their concerns.  I will respect whatever decision the owners make; but from a PR standpoint, I think it&#039;s bad for US Muslim leaders to pretend that the murder of 3,000 people had nothing to do with their religion.  They should show some sensitivity and withdraw all requests for a mosque there.]]></description>
