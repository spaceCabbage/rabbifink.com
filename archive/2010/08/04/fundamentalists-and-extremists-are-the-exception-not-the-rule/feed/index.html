		<description><![CDATA[David I saw your thread Im shocked. The argument is not about people I.E. Muslims but the source of their beliefs the Koran. You must educate yourself on it -It is bent on world domination just as Nazism and Communism were . The difference is that islam is a religious as well also a political movement.  It is a belief system of intolerance and conquest, which explains why Moslem upon Moslem violence is off the charts.  There are many Muslims who are decent people this in spite of the cruelty and  intolerance of the belief system they were inculcated with. Treatment of religious minorites homosexuals and women is mind- boggingly- horrible; when Palestinian children are taught thatJews are descendants of pigs and apes they are weaned directly from the Koran. During world war 2 there was a strong alliance between the Nazis and Muslims- it was a natural affinity- The most widely -read books in the Muslim world are Protocols of the Elders of Zion and Hitler&#039;s Mein Kampf. When Farrakhan cited Hitler as a great man as well as iranian hol0caust denier Ahminedejhad it was a totally natural thought within Islamic philosophy. Please open your eyes to the dangers- It might be too late for Europe]]></description>

But the reality is that the fundamentalists have hijacked the religion and the moderates are doing a piss poor job of taking it back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all Leslie I refer you, again, to this website:
http://www.loonwatch.com/2010/01/not-all-terrorists-are-muslims/

Secondly, tell me with true pure unadulterated honesty that you believe that every single Muslim is evil and out to get us.  Please I beg of you.  Because then it will be that much easier to dismiss that ideology which sounds suspiciously like the ideology shared by pretty much everyone on the planet for a few millenia about the Jews.

The world does not exist in two-tone.  It is not simply black and white.  When we fail to see in color, the world becomes a dangerous place.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hmmm, how many Orthodox fundamentalist Jews have murdered innocents?  Did their communities praise or condemn the acts the one or two times it may have happened?  Are people everywhere fearful of their safety when Orthodox Jews build a synagogue in their town?  How many Christians use their churches to plot the assassination of non-Christians?  Using a few freak examples in comparison to what is de riguer in the Muslim world is unfair and untruthful.  The numbers, and percentages, of Islamic extremists warrants our concern, to put it mildly.  To attempt to equalize each group, as though fundamentalist and extremist elements in the other religious groups are in any way comparable to Muslim fanatics, is a potentially suicidal fantasy.  Ask yourself one question:  when you hear about another bombing in the news, is your first assumption that it was committed by a Jew or a Christian, Hindu or Buddhist?  No!  We assume it was perpetrated by Muslims till proven otherwise.  And when is it proven otherwise?]]></description>
