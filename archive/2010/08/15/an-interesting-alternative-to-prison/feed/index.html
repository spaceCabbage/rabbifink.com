		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with the above article, and wouyld like to add that once time has been served these people are still not free, if time is served and they have been released into society again then a clean record shopuld be in order. I can not count the people most in early twenties that have done prison time and now have no chance what so ever in building a life as the punishment is for life....&quot;A Record&quot;. These people can not get decent jobs housing or even oppurtunities, so in essence they pay for their crime for life . We as a society force them back into crime by not deleting  their criminal record. We force them to register, check in , take them from their families, any support system or agency cant even help them, we might as well brand them with a giant &quot;C&quot; for criminal on their foreheads.  It would be easier to do that then to hide behind a mountain of papers that will not allow them a chance. I say if the punishment has been served then they deserve just that a fresh start clean and clear.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The majority of drug crimes is for possesion of marijuana and I am sorry but I honestly do not see where it is more dangerous than alcohol and you either do away with both and make them both a crime or make them both legal because if you are to be a responssible person you dont drink and drive but alcoholics spend most of their income on alcohol and are left in a position were they can not pay their bills or pay for groceries and their children go hungry not to mention the crimes that come along with the consumption of alcohol like those that beat their wives and kids because of intoxication ( not ever hearing of anyone that smokes marijuana do this) but wouldn&#039;t this be considered a double standard ? To answer your question of this person must smoke marijuana no I do not because of my position I have hair tests periodically and I would lose my way of making a living which would put me into poverty and in turn probably turn to crime to survive because poverty is the biggest crime against society.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Let me remind you that GOD does forgive also and we are supposed to live our lives in a Godly way..which includes us to forgive those who tresspass against us. Jesus said let he who is without sin cast the first stone. I know I&#039;m talking about sin not crime but one is not more different than the other here because we see crimes as a sin (crime against society) . As I see it there are other crimes against society that are caused by society and not punishable such as Poverty. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HH - &lt;i&gt;Can you be specific when you say the current system is a failure? What does that mean?&lt;/i&gt;

It means that we have a larger percentage of our population incarcerated than just about any other country in the world. It means that we have to suffer the extreme costs of that high level of incarceration. And because our prisons are &quot;crime schools&quot; it means that we are &quot;educating&quot; hundreds of thousands of new people each year to become better and more dangerous criminals.

Does that answer the question?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;Judaism is a red herring.

Not if you call yourself a rabbi and claim principles and values from that religion

&gt;My question still stands. Why should we punish criminals?

Because societies have rules. Think about it in the micro sense of your house hold and how depending on the rule broken, you punish your children. Now take that to the macro of a larger society, where if there are no consequences to any rule, well then....
And, well, after talking to a Prison Shrink once, I basically understood from him, that there are some bad people out there, that NEED to be kept apart from society.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Of course I &quot;knew&quot; people living in these neighborhoods when i went to public schools


&gt;And who are “these people”?

Not sure to what you mean here. People. Two arms, two legs.

&gt;They mostly get arrested on weapons and drugs charges.

Good, because gangs tend to use these weapons ( you know, like assault rifles and other illegal weapons) to intimidate (in neighborhoods and businesses) and kill others.

I don&#039;t understand. You are mentioning this as its no big deal. As if weapons=bubble gum.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;You have a very poor understanding of these neighborhoods. 99% of gang activity is not criminal. Further, membership in the gang is by default. If you live in the neighborhood you are in the gang. There’s no opt-out. Well there is an opt-out but it is rather permanent…

Ok. Fine.

So then they get into jail for what? Obviously some crime. I think you will say, these gangs have only been arrested for smoking weed or shop lifting no? People in these neighborhoods live in perpetual fear of these people. And for a reason. They are not synonymous with Pacific palisades white snobs that do drugs and shop life a purse from Macys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;It’s very relevant. God can punish people. We cannot.

Where are you getting this? Even Jewish courts can punish certain crimes. What about the idea of court systems under noahide rule? You don&#039;t think it would include punishment? You seem to be dismissing the— how shall we call this — the &quot;value&quot; of punishments, that even God is trying to teach man. Man needs rules. If you break rules,  there is a punishment for that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt;I’m sure you can see the difference between a Divinely instructed set of punishments and an unfair arbitrary discriminatory set of punishments.

You said:

It&#039;s irrelevant to WHERE those instructions come from. The point is that, from your perspective, even God says &quot;Man needs to be punished at times.&quot; Now, to what crimes, and how severe is the next issue.

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Can you be specific when you say the current system is a failure? What does that mean?&lt;/em&gt;

From the original article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...as it becomes ever clearer that, in the United States at least, traditional prison has become more or less synonymous with failed prison. By almost any metric, our practice of locking large numbers of people behind bars has proved at best ineffective and at worst a national disgrace. According to a recent Pew report, 2.3 million Americans are currently incarcerated—enough people to fill the city of Houston. Since 1983, the number of inmates has more than tripled and the total cost of corrections has jumped sixfold, from $10.4 billion to $68.7 billion. In California, the cost per inmate has kept pace with the cost of an Ivy League education, at just shy of $50,000 a year.

This might make some sense if crime rates had also tripled. But they haven’t: rather, even as crime has fallen, the sentences served by criminals have grown, thanks in large part to mandatory minimums and draconian three-strikes rules—politically popular measures that have shown little deterrent effect but have left the prison system overflowing with inmates. The vogue for incarceration might also make sense if the prisons repaid society’s investment by releasing reformed inmates who behaved better than before they were locked up. But that isn’t the case either: half of those released are back in prison within three years. Indeed, research by the economists Jesse Shapiro of the University of Chicago and M. Keith Chen of Yale indicates that the stated purpose of incarceration, which is to place prisoners under harsh conditions on the assumption that they will be “scared straight,” is actively counterproductive. Such conditions—and U.S. prisons are astonishingly harsh, with as many as 20 percent of male inmates facing sexual assault—typically harden criminals, making them more violent and predatory. Essentially, when we lock someone up today, we are agreeing to pay a large (and growing) sum of money merely to put off dealing with him until he is released in a few years, often as a greater menace to society than when he went in.&lt;/blockquote&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting option. I would add two other &quot;details:&quot;

1) If convicted of a crime that caused monetary damage, included in the &quot;monitoring&quot; is the income earned. A small percentage of all income, small enough not to become an impediment to wanting to get a job and become financially self-sufficient but enough to become an incentive not to repeat the offense, should be deducted from each paycheck
(similar to tax withholdings) and go towards restitution.

2) At least at the onset of the transition, those convicted should have the option of either being monitored or going to prison so that they don&#039;t resent the &quot;intrusion&quot; and can focus on moving on. Part of this should be making prison a less-enticing choice for those that might consider it, with mandated goals for each prisoner in order to be released.]]></description>
