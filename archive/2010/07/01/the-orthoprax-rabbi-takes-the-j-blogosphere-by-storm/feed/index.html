		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;Even if he is not actually a rabbi he does bring some very important issues to light that I am sure many people in our community are struggling with. Perhaps if we would answer more questions when these people were younger and engage them more in questions of theology we would have less of an issue with so many people feeling “stuck” and “orthoprax” at an older age.&lt;/em&gt;

That is precisely what I wrote here:

		<description><![CDATA[Religions are generally belief systems in a superior form--in the case of the Jews, God.  Therefore, any of those various divisions of Judaism are belief based.  Certainly orthodoxy can be said to be constructed this way.  So how is it possible to say that one can be orthodox--a label that can only be applied to those who are &quot;true and full&quot; believers of a God-based religion--but not believe in God? Conflict of terms here. &quot;Real&quot; practice of a religion requires, at a minimum, a belief in the underlying system.  Otherwise a person is not orthodox, or orthoprax if you must, but is merely aping some outward practices of the orthodox Jews.  If I eat fish on Friday and attend mass does that make me Catholic? The catholics would immediately say no.  Why are we so reticent to say that whatever the &quot;prax&quot; people are doing, it&#039;s not a Jewish practice, much less an orthodox practice.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have no clue what his contract says.

If it is anything like the Rabbi contract I signed it says nothing about his religious observance.

He may be &quot;pasul&quot; from rendering psak, but if he is just reporting what it says in SH&quot;A he isn&#039;t really paskening - is he?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[very interesting.  Like Rabbi Maryles, my gut instinct is also that this is a hoax.

If it&#039;s true, then this rabbi would likely be in violation of his contract with his synagogue.

One of the main tasks of a rabbi of an Orthodox congregation is giving psak halacha. (Jewish legal decisions).

If he doesn&#039;t &quot;keep much of any Jewish law&quot; - then is he pasul (disqualified) from rendering such decisions.

If the synagogue thinks that it is paying someone who is qualified to render such decisions, then he is guilty of fraud - or at the very least, breach of contract.

What say you, Rabbi (and soon to be esq) Fink?]]></description>
