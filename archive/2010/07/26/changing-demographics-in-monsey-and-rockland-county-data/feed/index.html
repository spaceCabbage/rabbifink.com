		<description><![CDATA[I have lived in Monsey (I have since escaped, although I visit often), and I would agree that the demographic shift, and all its ramifications, illustrate the broader point that you made. I dont want to get into greater detail than that in a public forum, to avoid chilul hashem. The school board circus (who&#039;s goals I am somewhat sympathetic to) is a case in point. I will say, that the eventual issues, conflicts, that such a demographic shift creates are not one sided, and that anti-semitism (I know you will disagree with me here) often plays a role, as it did to some extent with the Preserve Ramapo folks.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thinking about this, I now wonder if our naming conventions don&#039;t have something to do with this.  Imagine that there are 10,000 fairly common names Americans tend to choose from, and only 100 &quot;frum&quot; names.  (Obviously these are just examples).  Especially among Chasidim and very traditional Jews, the vast majority choose from a relatively small set of Biblical names, with some Talmudic and Yiddish names thrown in.  [In modern Israel there are more Hebrew names available.]  So even if an equal number of frum and non-frum/non-Jewish kids are born, there is likely to be skewing to the Biblical names simply because the non-frum/non-Jews are choosing their kids&#039; names from a larger, more diverse set.  Anyway, given current trends, there are bound to be a large number of Michaels, Rachels, and Josephs even among the non-frum/non-Jewish pop.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow. Apology totally accepted. Plus an invite to grab some sushi while I am marooned in monsey sometime over the next few weeks.

As to your points, Monsey is better than most places. I like it. I just like LA so much more.

But ya gotta admit that giving the yiden more and more political power has not contributed to a better quality of life for Monseyites...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rockland County has about 300,000 residents. It has about 22,500 children under age 5. Well, there ya go, of those 22,500, New Square probably accounts for a goodly number, then add all the Wesley Hills folks, Monsey, New Hempstead, Spring Valley, and Suffern (?) and you can easily explain all the Jewish names of the kids. I bet non-Jews in RC aren&#039;t having as many kids, or are older and their kids have already moved out. Who wants to live with a bunch of Jews anyway, especially when you can sell your house and buy an identical one a few miles east or west for 2/3 the price?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ביטע מוחל מיר. אלול איז באַלד געקומען

I guess I was having a bad day at work, wherein I constantly hear sniping and put-downs about Monsey and היימישער yiden (thus myself by extension) and so I lashed out viscerally at your post.

While Monsey is far from perfect, it is a  מחיה
compared to other היימישער hoods like BP and WillyB.  Its also a lot more diverse and tolerant.

But in any event, I hope you&#039;ll accept my apology.

PS, pecans are not nuts, nor are they native to California...



&quot;The pecan (pronounced /pɨˈkɑːn/, /pɨˈkæn/, or /ˈpiːkæn/), Carya illinoinensis or illinoensis, is a species of hickory, native to south-central North America, in Mexico from Coahuila  south to Jalisco  and Veracruz,[1][2]  in the United States from southern Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Indiana  east to western Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and western Tennessee, south through Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Florida, and west into New Mexico.

Pecans, like the fruit of all other members of the hickory genus, are not true nuts but technically a drupe (fruit with a single stone or pit).&quot;]]></description>
