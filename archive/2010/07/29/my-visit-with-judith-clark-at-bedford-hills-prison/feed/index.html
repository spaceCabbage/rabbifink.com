		<description><![CDATA[My friend, these 2 situations are extreme opposites of the spectrum. The comparisons are getting silly.

Clark has served 30 years in prison. She admits wrongdoing, expressed remorse, wishes to help others rehabilitate and is stuck in an unfortuntate legal position due to her mistakes in filing a timely appeal. Her co-defendants are almost all out of prison already and she had the longest sentence of all her co-defendants despite a low level role in the crime.

Rubashkin has a machine working for his release. The machine does not acknowledge any criminal activity. The machine foists upon the public an idea (anti-semitism) and the public buys it, forgetting the crime, forgetting his lawyer denied any such notion and worst of all, completely pulling the wool over the public about the entire case. I have heard THE MOST RIDICULOUS assertions about the Rubashkin case. All I set out to do was be honest and hope and pray that he gets off - but he gets off as a crook, not a civil rights victim.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry, I misread your comment above.
When I read your Rubashkin posts, I see you laying out point-by-point, why although you feel he was punished harshly, all the reasons why you dont think that punishment was unearned. Would you agree with that description?

In contrast, in the post above, you describe how wonderful and repentant Judith Clark is, while glossing over what she actually did (&quot;What was clear to me, was her regret for being involved with a radical group&quot;). I had to click on her site to read the story of what she actually did.

Can you see why that would come off as more sympathetic to her than him?]]></description>

The unsympathetic tone is not about whether I agree with his sentence. It is about the factors I mentioned in the last comment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I reread your Rubashkin posts, but could not find where you stated that you were &quot;not in favor of incarceration for Rubashkin.&quot; The closest that I saw was were a couple sentences where you said you felt terrible for him, as you would any crminal sentenced to prison, and that you thought 27 years was harsh. These points were imbedded in posts about him that were decidedly unsympathetic to him in tone and substance.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Reread the Rubashkin posts.

I am not in favor of incarceration for Rubashkin. In fact, I signed a petition to get him a lenient sentence.

I am against the claims of anti-semitism and the excuses people make for him and his lack of remorse and his failure to apologize and the false claim that white collar crime is victimless and the failure of the frum community to &quot;learn&quot; from Rubashkin that stealing is bad and will get you in trouble.]]></description>
