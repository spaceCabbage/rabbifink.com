		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to respond to such an older post, but I only just recently took the chance to visit the museum for my birthday (yes, I went to a Holocaust exhibit for my birthday, but I felt it a good opportunity to get more emotional experience paired with the knowledge I already had for a relevant screenplay I&#039;m working on).

The shtetl video portion of the walking touring was actually one of the more interesting portions I took away from the trip, and largely because it was the part of the historical timeline I had the least knowledge of (Fiddler on the Roof being the next best media text I could draw from). I agree that a lot of the exhibit is designed to be overwrought and romantic in its depictions, but there&#039;s a narrative structure they&#039;re trying to build into it, so it has some point (or at least reason) to it.

I&#039;m interested in your perspective on the depiction at the museum, versus your thoughts on this period of Jewish life in history.]]></description>
