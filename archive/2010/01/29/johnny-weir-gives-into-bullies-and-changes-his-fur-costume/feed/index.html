		<description><![CDATA[And just who would know the difference if Weir was wearing real fur or fake fur? He can say whatever he wants but no one is going to be able to tell the difference.  My father a&quot;h was in the fur business and I grew up around them and wearing them.  Way back when the imitations looked like what they were--fake.  Today (as is the case with imitation diamonds as well) no Joe Shmo can tell the difference and even professionals can get fooled.  There was a case here a while back where the animal rightists spray painted a coat that a woman was wearing that was supposedly mink.  They paid through the nose for that attack--the coat was faux fur.  Surely there must be something more urgent and necessary for society that these people could get behind?

And yes, where is the police investigation about the threats?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;s say anything other than what the AP article said. Apparently, in the past PETA has been in contact with Weir about his costumes, maybe not this particular costume, and they dealt with each other in a &quot;professional manner&quot; as per the AP article. Take it up with Ms. Armour, the AP Staff Writer who wrote the article.

I added Friends of Animals to the post.

You ask great questions. I too am curious what sort of threats he received.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Peta had nothing to do with the campaign. Friends of Animals sent a press release to his costume designer. These facts are plastered all over the internet, so not sure how Peta got in this article.

Also, am I the only one that is wondering where the police reports are? Death threats against a public figure are really serious --- where are cops announcing on the news that an investigation has been established? No one is asking about this, why?]]></description>
