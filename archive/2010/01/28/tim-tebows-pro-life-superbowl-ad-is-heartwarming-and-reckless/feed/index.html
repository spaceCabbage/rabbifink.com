		<description><![CDATA[The reasons they would deny an ad such as Gay Matchmakers is probably because they fear the backlash would be too severe to justify taking the money. Just my thoughts. I believe more Americans are anti-abortion than pro-gay so it was a calculated risk.

You are 100% correct that just because you have a platform (fame / movie star / athlete) it makes you no more qualified to make a political statement. Great point about the President too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You had pointed out in the article that in ths economy if a company wants to lay out 2.6 millon for a commercial why not take it, well then how come when CBS was approached by a Gay Matchmakers site that had wanted to advertise during the Super Bowl they were denied.  I think it that CBS clearly had thier own political views when making decisions for the Super Bowl.

I also don&#039;t like how politicians, and political groups use sports to get across their message.  When OBama was on TV at the Georgetown/Duke bball game on Saturday he didnt mention one aspect of the goverment, politics etc and soley stuck to sports.  It is a sporting event which is suppose to fun, enjoyable, exciting keep it to that and if you want to get your political views do it in a magazine, or a news station.  Don&#039;t piggyback the Super Bowl because 100 Mil are watching and otherwise the majority of the public doesn&#039;t talk about it.]]></description>
