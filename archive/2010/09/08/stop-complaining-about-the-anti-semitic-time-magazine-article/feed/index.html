		<description><![CDATA[i forgot talk about provocative the wsj critique (not surprisingly by the ex editor of the jpost) was &quot;rhymes with fagin&quot; it then proceeded to play the always reliable &quot;neo nazi&quot; card as well as the deligitimization trope

btw if you&#039;re worried about the&quot; international isolation&quot; of israel put down your jpost and take a trip in herziliya past the local hqs of intel, microsoft , cisco, sandisk, nike etc etc etc
then as noted in the time article measure the size of the biz sections in the papers]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[thank you thank you I just returned from 2 months in israel and never have found an article in a us publication so reflective of the mood...and i am fluent in hebrew, follow the hebrew language media obsessively, travelled the country top to bottom and spent much of my time with native israelis

as all of us enter the new year praying for a prosperous, healthy israel where people can go to concerts, shopping and shul without daily fear and dont obsess over every up and down of international politics it is quite amazing that when time magazine reports that is exactly what is going on the reaction we get is the article is a blood libel (arutz sheva) or neo nazi delegitimization of israel....plllllease

if that is the case then lay that label on me too. But first go to avarahamtal.co.il and listen to some of his great bestselling songs. Among the lyricis:

hachayim ha tovim he meelchamot ha rechokim

&quot;the good life, the remote wars&quot; another example of the blood libel i guess

shana tovah po u baaretz]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I knew that would be the answer hence the added question &quot;And how does it do that?&quot; :-)

I sure hope you are in touch enough to realize that today (perhaps unlike 30 years ago) Israel is MUCH more than Tel Aviv beaches and coffeehouses!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry but are you reading the same article I am????

Pictures:
1. A magen david made of some sort of flowers (carnations?)
2. A long-haired guy sitting on the beach with his friends smoking a hookah (which incidentally might represent smoking weed as he&#039;s looking quite laid back)
3. Another guy on the beach with a tattoo of a magen david with &quot;Chai&quot; inside (along with some English writing below). As a bonus, this picture has dual magen davids, one is also in the flag in the background.
4. ANOTHER picture of the beach with some sort of barrier in the sand (is this the separate swimming male/female beach?) Again a magen david in the flag.
5. AGAIN a beach picture with a soldier (out of proper uniform) relaxing on the sand.
6. A woman and her child in a stroller, with ... wait for it ... a smiley face balloon!
7. A coffee house. Again, in Tel Aviv.
8. The security barrier and a kid on a bicycle gazing at it.

So what story do the pictures tell? That Israel is a nation-state comprising mostly of Tel Aviv and a lot of beaches with nationalist symbols everywhere, even on their skin. :-)

Which picture tells of success in your opinion? And how does it do that? Which picture portrays first-world-ness in your opinion?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with you in theory. The substance of the article is neither objectionable nor biased, and thus should be promoted as worth reading. And the incendiary cover doesn&#039;t discount the value of the article, of course. But since there are serious practical ramifications to putting out a cover like that, it&#039;s worth the energy ripping it. Those who do should do aim to do so with nuance (that&#039;s what I was trying to do in my initial comment), but the cover is not a footnote here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We both know that it doesn&#039;t work like that. People will see the cover and refer to it without reading the article. This would probably be true 10 and 20 years ago; in today&#039;s world of short attention spans and 140-character sound bites, it&#039;s almost a certainty. People will form opinions or cement already-formed ones by the cover, which makes a blanket statement about Israel the state, as opposed to the people of Israel. Yes, if someone is nuanced enough to look at the cover and say, &quot;Oh, interesting, Israel doesn&#039;t care about peace?&quot;, reads the article (small chance of that, by the way, since TIME doesn&#039;t put the full article online - how many people are going to buy off the newsstand?), understands the context, and now has a better understanding of Israelis&#039; attitudes, great. But that person will be quite rare.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with many of the points you made. But while it&#039;s important to read the article and understand its context, you can&#039;t just look past the cover and simply cast it away as &quot;unfortunate.&quot; Covers sell magazines. Covers drive the conversation. TIME knew what it was doing when it put those words on the cover, knowing the ration of people who read covers to people who read articles. It wasn&#039;t an unfortunate cover; it was a deliberate decision, with the financial bottom line in mind, and the collateral damage potentially inflicted ignored. I&#039;m glad that the writer of the article took a measured, fair approach to his reporting and analysis. But while I don&#039;t tend to obsess over anti-Israel bias in the media (mostly because so many others in the Orthodox world overcompensate), it&#039;s fair to call out TIME for mischaracterizing their own article by producing a cover they knew was incendiary.

(As a friend of mine said: it would have been more accurate to title the cover &quot;Why Israelis Don&#039;t Care About Peace.&quot; But that&#039;s not as sensational and won&#039;t sell as many copies.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My main criticism of the article (besides the attention-grabbing headline) is the choice of pictures. They are terrible and don&#039;t represent Israel in any way - unless you think Israel is composed entirely of &quot;beach bums&quot;. You would think that they would include one beach picture, one picture representing the massive intellectual growth industries (even a simple TA skyline might do for that, or better yet, a comparison of the skyline 20 years ago with today&#039;s),one picture of cranes building large new communities,and a picture representing the huge improvement in infrastructure (maybe one of the new interchanges, or a rail station, or something like that). And it&#039;s especially sad because many people gloss over the words and let the pictures &quot;tell the tale&quot; instead.]]></description>
