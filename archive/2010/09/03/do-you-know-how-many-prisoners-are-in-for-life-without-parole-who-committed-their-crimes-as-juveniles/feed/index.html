		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not setting this out a social policy (there are many additional issues that would affect that) but think about this; In Jewish Law the age of criminal responsibility is 13 for a male and 12 for a female. This is in regard to being judged by a human court. As regards Heavenly judgment, you are not punished for what you do between the ages of 13 and 20 (the teen years). 

What that is showing us is that, although there is a period of life in which you even normal human beings are not fully responsible for your actions, that lack of responsibility are beyond the remit of a human tribunal to take into account. So it seems that there can be a distinction between exact justice (only enforceable by G-d) and an approximate justice enforceable by humans.

BTW, there is a sentence available to the courts in the UK used mainly for minors convicted of murder, detention &quot;at Her Majesty&#039;s pleasure&quot;. This is an indefinite sentence (usually with a minimum prescribed by the sentencing judge) that is periodically reviewed to determine if &quot;there has been a significant change in the offender&#039;s attitude and behaviour&quot;. At that point the sentence is deemed complete and the offender released.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;I think you should check your facts
&lt;/em&gt;
These are the facts. They have been checked.

&lt;em&gt;and grammar
&lt;/em&gt;
Excuse the grammar please.

&lt;em&gt;You might want to look into what ‘Life in prison’ means.
&lt;/em&gt;
Life in prison means nothing. Life in prison WITHOUT PAROLE (the subject of this post) means exactly what it sounds like. They NEVER get out. Never. Never ever. Never ever ever.

&lt;em&gt;I am sure that it changes in each state
&lt;/em&gt;
YOU might want to check you facts. (They are wrong.)

&lt;em&gt;definately is a 25 year sentence in Australia
&lt;/em&gt;
…and the rest of the entire world. The USA is harsher on crime than any other civilized country. That is the point I am making. Congratulations to Australia for being sane.

&lt;em&gt;f you do not like the laws of the United States, why not just leave?
&lt;/em&gt;
I am a law student. I hope to make changes in the country I call home.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jim -&lt;i&gt;By they way, if you do not like the laws of the United States, why not just leave?&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;Love it or leave it&quot; isn&#039;t a particularly good argument. Some people love it and want to make it better (in their own view, of course).]]></description>

I am sure that it changes in each state and definately is a 25 year sentence in Australia. So, as in your example,  a 16yo would get released at 41 years of age. I think this is fair for murder!
