		<description><![CDATA[Great Lesson! Unfortunately we cannot create our own societies in which to raise our children as Kayin did. I think that the fundamental decision of where to live is too often based on materialistic needs as opposed to what is bets for our children. As a young parent it is something that I think about everyday. Where should I raise a family? What community will help my children thrive the most and their spiritual growth? These questions are too often replaced with: Where can I maximize my financial growth? Where can I best treat my family to the materialistic pleasures of life? Although these questions are important too, we must prioritize. Seeking the guidance of our spiritual leaders, our rabbis, would be a great place to start.]]></description>
