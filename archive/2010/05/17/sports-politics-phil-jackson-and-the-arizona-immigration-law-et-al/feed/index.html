		<description><![CDATA[Jojo, are you comparing the struggle for civil rights of American citizens to criminal trespass?

Do you want to remove all borders and give American citizenship to everyone in the world?

For your own sake, I hope that the U.S. and other strong, free nations never surrender their sovereignty to a global government.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was surprising to hear because it was such an overtly hypocritical statement. On one hand, Jackson says sports and politics don&#039;t miss. He also sees it fit to wear campaign pins on the bench during games. It&#039;s surprising to hear someone who is obviously so smart say something that&#039;s obviously so hypocritical.

It&#039;s also stupid to say &quot;the American people want (fill in blank).&quot;

The American people in the South also wanted Rosa Parks to stand up and desegregation. It didn&#039;t make it right, but that&#039;s what they wanted.

These were extremly misguided statements by Jackson. As a celebrity, he shouldn&#039;t act surprised by criticism when he presents an opinion on a controversial political issue. Neither should you.]]></description>
