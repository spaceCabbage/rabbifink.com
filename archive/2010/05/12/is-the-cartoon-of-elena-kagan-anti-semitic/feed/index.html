		<description><![CDATA[I am opposed to everything I&#039;ve heard about Elena Kagan&#039;s political viewpoint and I prayed she would never make it to the SCOTUS but there is no doubt that this cartoon is anti-Semitic. It&#039;s reminiscent of the vile propaganda of the Nazi&#039;s. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This post was written while everyone was still sorting our her sexuality. Religion didn&#039;t play into the discussion until after I wrote the post.

The logic is simple. A cartoon that accentuates a particular woman&#039;s features is not anti-semitic. Whereas a cartoon that creates an ugly caricature and applies said ugly caricature to a group in order to vilify that group is hateful and in the case of Jews, anti-semitic.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have seen many references to her religion in the mainstream media. Almost every in-depth article about her mentions it. By your logic (which I actually am having trouble following), I guess Frank Lautenberg is Orthodox? http://mediamatters.org/blog/201005140058]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, it&#039;s not anti-semitic. she has a very large, very ugly nose that is unavoidable and impossible to ignore. it&#039;s her most noticeable feature.

anyone who has been to Israel knows that most jews have very average sized noses; emmanuelle Chiriqui, for example, is beautiful and she is jewish. Elena kagan is jewish, and she is hideous. it isn&#039;t religious in nature.

you&#039;re just overtly sensitive and try to see controversy where there is none. stop it. there is no story here. go back to creating more conspiracies of anti-semitism where there are none.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, and judging from Waghorn&#039;s other caricatures, I&#039;d say he/she was a Bush Hater=Kagan lover. Can they be anti-Semitic too, or is it only right wingers?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The cartoon was there before the nomination, I believe. And I like how you call me insecure. I&#039;d say that you were naive, but then I&#039;d be using silly cliches just like you.
