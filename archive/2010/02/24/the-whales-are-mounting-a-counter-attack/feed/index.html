		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve had the opportunity to work in an aquarium that used to keep whales in captivity and stopped doing so (do to changing beliefs about what&#039;s right), and I&#039;ve had the opportunity to observe different kinds of whales and dolphins in several different countries. In one instance, I was even able to swim in the open ocean right near a pod of dolphins in a country that does it right in how they regulate commercial enterprises with the environmental concerns for the animals &#038; the need for more research about these creatures. It was an amazing experience.

Speaking of &quot;hostility&quot; makes very little sense when applied to the animal kingdom. Dolphins are essentially whales (there are marine biologists who&#039;ll fight over the terminology whether dolphins ARE one category of whale or not - it&#039;s not my point to get into that quibble). So I&#039;m going to comment about dolphins and whales here.

Dolphins in the wild are fairly unique in that they are KNOWN to kill for sport and engage in non-consensual group sex. We&#039;d call these things murder and rape if they were people. They aren&#039;t human, though, so it makes no sense to say this is hostile. There is no morality in a group of dolphins batting around a seal for fun. It&#039;s unusual in the animal kingdom to find creatures that kill for play, sport, or fun (people do it too, of course - it&#039;s called &quot;hunting&quot;). Yet these marine mammals do. Don&#039;t be fooled by their high intelligence and &#039;smiling&#039; faces - they can be very dangerous in certain circumstances.

Dolphins and whales do not kill humans regularly in the wild, because people do not live in the ocean. So that proof doesn&#039;t make any sense. Moose don&#039;t regularly kill people in the wild to eat, but they are more fatal than bears if you do happen to come upon one. Different kinds of dolphins and whales have a different attitude toward people (curiosity, avoidance, etc.) and in some regions, they may be more or less habitualized to people. If you want to go swim near a pod of Orcas, let me know how that goes. They are likely to kill you out of curiosity or by accident even before they kill you on purpose. If you go whale-watch on a larger boat, the same Orcas will &quot;play with&quot; and &quot;race&quot; your boat. They are truly majestic creatures.

As for captivity, sadly, many dolphins and whales who are brought into captivity will never be able to return to the wild and reunite with their pods. Fortunately, some can. But for those who can&#039;t, that&#039;s pretty much the only &quot;good&quot; reason for keeping them confined - if they have reached the point of not being able to survive without people.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just ran across this, I myself am specifically interested in the field of Ocean animals and have a blog here that I started recently about them over here http://voiceofoceananimals.blogspot.com/.  I&#039;d ran across other articles about dangers of dolphins in captivity and such before this incident even ocurred, besides the general articles about human interference with the whales life.  Obviously this incident is going to have big ramifications in either the continuation of major projects like seaworld and other exhibits, or at least the format.  Ultimately wild animals are wild animals and we can&#039;t control how they act or ultimately understand their behavior towards us, but I will say that this incident should in no way arouse a general dislike towards these creatures.  As to whether or not whales or dolphins should be kept in captivity, I don&#039;t think animals meant for the wild should be kept as pets, but I still don&#039;t believe these animals are as hostile as what this incident would have some to believe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have similar feelings regarding [most] pets.  First objection is - &quot;What right do we have to &quot;keep&quot; animals?&quot;. Second, the way we keep them is often cruel, many of them we keep in cages just as zoos do, and even the ones outside a traditional cage are still encaged in an apartment or a house. Then, we often (almost always as most of us work outside the house during the day, and most of our kids attend school during the day) abandon them for long periods of time with no one of their own species or of ours to keep them company.

And for another question of morality - is it moral to breed animals solely for our pleasure? I don&#039;t mean the eating meat question (that&#039;s been discussed before in many different forums), I mean breeding them for us to cage them and allow them out periodically to provide for our amusement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While care must be taken (and often is) to recreate their natural habitat, there is one additional aspect I think is worth mentioning.

Not infrequently, an animal that would not have survived in its natural habitat is &quot;saved&quot; and brought to a zoo-type place to be healed and nursed back to health. With some species, the only ones in captivity are those who were saved. And by studying animal life in such setting, humans can better understand what needs to be done to help those in the wild.

Is this worth capturing animals for our viewing pleasure? I&#039;m not going to make a judgment. I will add, though, that the fourth plague, &quot;arov&quot; (a mixed multitude of animals), is said by our Sages of Blessed Memory to have been brought on the Egyptians because they forced us to go into the wild to capture animals for their zoos and circuses.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a HUGE problem with old-fashioned zoos where animals are caged in small cages with no concern for their needs.

I don&#039;t think all zoos are the same though. I think the lions in the Ramat Gan Safari are handled very well (I&#039;ve been on a private tour with their head keeper once), same goes for the other free-roaming animals there.

My concern is with animal welfare. Not with out own discomfort at perceived misery, which is often a projection of our own feelings. As a human, you&#039;d be stressed out of your skull from being &quot;gawked&quot; at. Not necessarily the same if you&#039;re a shark in a large aquarium. Your issue as an animal would be that of lack of a large enough territory to fit your needs.

Bottom line, it&#039;s good to care about animals and to have a heart for them. The best thing you can do is fight against the mass-scale cruelty of the farming industry. Fight against battery coops for hens. Fight against castrating and de-horning calves with no anesthesia. Fight against the dozens of other horrendous practices applied so you can have your milk, eggs and meat. And IMO, at this stage, the way to go is vegan - simple and solely as a refusal to cooperate with the mass-scale torture of animals done on a daily and hourly basis. Zoo animals is such a negligent concern in comparison.]]></description>
