		<description><![CDATA[Hillary Clinton saw to it that the Clinton machine tried to destroy the lives of the women Bill Clinton not just had affairs with but sexually assaulted and in at least once case violently raped; there were five witnesses to this victim&#039;s story and physical condition after the rape. If her case had been dealt with by the standards Hillary advocates for under Title IX, Bill Clinton would not have been President and Hillary would probably not be on ballots today.

True, Hillary was not the predator. Bill was. But she enabled him and led the damage control, all the while demanding that we should &quot;believe the victims.&quot;  What did it feel like to be a victim of sex abuse in the Clinton era? Believe Bill&#039;s victims too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Which holy values are being protected by bullies like Trump??

Just for fun let me show you some of holes in this holy comment.

1. Nothing is equal. Everything is subjective. However, sexual touching without consent is a broad category that includes many things. The violation of a woman’s right to be free from being touched sexually without consent should be uncontested. Trump thinks, speaks, and acts as if consent is irrelevant. This is more abhorrent than any semantic or categorization you disagree with. END. 
2. You should not have done what you did to your friend. You realized that and you apologized. Trump is proud of his far worse actions. He doesn’t apologize - he brags! And you approve! SAD! 
3.Women have never been more empowered and more self sufficient and treated more equally in the entire course of human history. NEVER. Your silly complaint about “climate” is something that probably needs to be dealt with. But it’s worth fixing that “problem” at the cost of reversing 6000 years of progress towards treated women as we would to be treated. 
I probably won’t read your response if you do respond. Nothing more needs to be said.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;Whether Donald Trump turned sex abuse into a punch line or into a boast, his words tear at the heart of anyone who has been raped or touched or groped or even gawked at sexually or violated in any way without consent. 

And therein lies why i would prefer voting for Trump over a leftist. The Left have successfully created a pot where you toss in everything, and everything is equal. In this case, sexual abuse/assault. A rape is equivalent to a grope and a grope is equivalent to being gawked at. The common denominator is that it all happens to women without any consent, therefore all must be equal in their moral depravity. Men gawk at women. Many times we look at women and indeed we can even undress women with our eyes, and even imagine more than that. If a woman FEELS abused or violated by such action I suggest she go commit herself immediately. In my teens, I slapped a friend on the ass. I didn&#039;t get written consent. I did&#039;t get prior oral consent. We didn&#039;t stand in front of a beit din to express my spontaneous action.  I just slapped her ass. She gave me a look and told me not to do it. I apologized and guess what? We went on with our day. Had that happened today she would be brainwashed into thinking she is a survivor of a debilitating sexual assault and would need to find immediate safe refuge to hobble over and cry how victimized she was.

As much as I can&#039;t stand Trump, I would prefer him over the climate in which the Left have created: women being taught to be pathetic, frail victims of every gaze upon them and a men have to be systematically retrained because everything they do is equivalent to rape. Let the witch hunts begin. This sort of narrative is pure insanity. There is no nuance left in any conversation.

My vote is for a little common sense in this regard, and not leftist hysteria.]]></description>

But the main point is this. I AM VOTING AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON. I am voting against elevating a corrupt grifter and sociopathic liar to the White House. Trump is awful but the nation can survive him.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[XY sperm move faster but die more quickly, while XX sperm move more slowly and live longer.  Thus, timing intercourse as close as possible to ovulation does result in more boys while timing it for a few days before results in more girls.  Women do release seeds -- eggs are our contribution to the reproductive process -- so there was nothing fundamentally wrong with either Greek or Talmudic science in this case.  Some believe that female orgasm can hasten ovulation and/or help sperm move faster up the reproductive tract.  Combining it with intercourse timed as close as possible to ovulation seems like a good way to help the XYs.  While Greek and Talmudic science were wrong on many things, remember that people have been reproducing other people for a long time and that people who live in small intimate communities and who observe cause and effect over time can and do discover scientific truths.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope it is not too late to comment on this timeless piece. Although I agree that giving people positive Jewish experiences is a start in the right direction, it is not enough. People starting out need a community to be apart of.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hope it is not too late to comment on this timeless piece. Although I agree that giving people positive Jewish experiences is a start in the right direction, it is not enough. People starting out need a community to be apart of. In most cases in needs to be a community of peers, not a Rabbi. For the cost of one &#8220;kiruv professional&#8221; you could subsidize a peer-led community of 100 and get much more accomplished. In the secular Jewish world the model is Moishe House. We need something like that for young people interested in exploring and experimenting with traditional Judaism.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Great essay, but this line requires clarification: &quot;Soon, no one will care what Rabbi Gordimer or Prof. Marc Shapiro said about the kashrus of Open Orthodoxy.&quot; 

This may suggest some kind of symmetry between the positions of R. Gordimer and Prof. Shapiro.  In fact, Prof. Shapiro has not taken a stance on the &quot;kashrus&quot; of OO.  R. Gordimer&#039;s agenda, in contrast, is clear. 

Also, Prof. Shapiro is an independent scholar, whereas R. Gordimer has just admitted that he writes with &quot;the continuing encouragement and authorization of roshei yeshiva and poskim, mostly not from the yeshivish world.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would like to point out that the problem is that so-called &quot;chazal&quot; have absolutely no legitimate authority according to the Written Torah. Levites and Judges are the ones who have legitimate authority to interpret the Written Torah.

YLT Dt 17:8 .  &#039;When anything is too hard for thee for judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke--matters of strife within thy gates--then thou hast risen, and gone up unto the place on which Jehovah thy God doth fix,

YLT Dt 17:9 and hast come in unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge who is in those days, and hast inquired, and they have declared to thee the word of judgment,

YLT Dt 17:10 and thou hast done according to the tenor of the word which they declare to thee (they of that place which Jehovah doth choose; and thou hast observed to do according to all that they direct thee.

YLT Dt 17:11  &#039;According to the tenor of the law which they direct thee, and according to the judgment which they say to thee thou dost do; thou dost not turn aside from the word which they declare to thee, right or left.

YLT Dt 17:12 And the man who acteth with presumption, so as not to hearken unto the priest (who is standing to serve there Jehovah thy God), or unto the judge, even that man hath died, and thou hast put away the evil thing from Israel,

YLT Dt 17:13 and all the people do hear and fear, and do not presume any more.

And we are to listen to Levites and Judges ONLY if they follow Written Torah. If they preach something else - they give-up their authority and right to interpret the Torah.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree. There are no &quot;sacrifices&quot; in the Written Torah. All edible meat from killed animals would go to levites for food. The only parts of the animal that were completely burnt were fat, kidneys, e.t.c non edible stuff basically. It was glorified animal slaughter for food. Not a sacrifice in a pagan sense of this word. And Passover is just like thanksgiving, only we have a lamb instead of turkey. So what &quot;sacrifices&quot; we are talking about here?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I disagree in part.  Things will be more decentralized, yet people will still seek out authority figures and leadership because there is the issue of specialization; most people don&#039;t have the time, talent or inclination to deeply understand halachic issues, but want to feel they are good people doing God&#039;s will.  The difference will be in how they choose and judge the leaders they turn to.  Those leaders authority will not come so much from rising through the established power structures as it will come from a demonstrated high level of scholarship which is clearly based on a modern Western understanding of the concept of Truth.  People want truth, not blind commitment to 1000 years of exilic stringencies.   People will go back to the Toarh roots, and reject harmful customs that came about during the long exile.  Why should a woman who ovulates prior to the 12th day not have children just because Babylonian Jews where trying to out frum their Zorastrian neighbors 1500 years ago?  Why would people wait 6 hours after eating chicken when the Talmud didn&#039;t even require kinuach ha-peh?  That&#039;s were things are going.  There will still be authority, but of a different kind which is based on modern concepts of truth.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;em&gt;You can influence and inspire an inclusive future or waste more time sustaining a divisive Quixotic Crusade disguised as an imperative war. We’ve made our choice. You make yours. Choose wisely.&lt;/em&gt;

Interesting that you would ask someone to choose wisely. Wisdom is something accumulated with age and experience. Have millenniums accumulated enough wisdom that something like open orthodoxy is a viable alternative? Is it just another fad of the time? Does it have a solid anchor that will allow to be passed down from generation to generation? Neo-chassidus? Online communities? How far can that really go before the next generation gets bored again and it needs to be changed? Is there any viability for the long haul? Im very skeptical about any of these new fads.

I agree with you, there is a problem. I don&#039;t know how much of it is  that authority is stifling vs. millenniums just don&#039;t care for the concept of authority. I think depending on the community, it&#039;s a combination of both. If it&#039;s an issue of authority being stifling to personal expression and experience than that needs to be addressed. If it&#039;s simply millenniums continuing the 60&#039;s proverb of &quot;Don&#039;t trust anyone over 30&quot; with a 21st century twist, than eventually, I believe they will grow up. If they want Judaism to continue as a religion, and not just a flavor of the month experience, than rules, boundaries and authority will automatically be a value they will accept eventually (to varying degrees obviously). But to present everything that is going on, as some Quixotic crusades makes it seem like you have been asleep for the last 150 years and that we have no patterns of evidence of what happens to a movement as it gets more &quot;liberalized,&quot; for a lack of a better term.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;*** QUOTE 1 OF 3: ***&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rambam&lt;/i&gt;’s &lt;i&gt;Hilchot Teshuvah&lt;/i&gt;, chapter 3, paragraph 8:&lt;/b&gt; 
 If any Jew denies that even ONE WORD of the Torah is Divinely-revealed, then he or she is a heretic &lt;i&gt;apikuris&lt;/i&gt;].   

In the same paragraph, &lt;i&gt;Rambam&lt;/i&gt; teaches that any Jew who denies the Oral Law [&lt;i&gt;Torah SheBeAl Peh&lt;/i&gt;] is also a heretic [&lt;i&gt;apikuris&lt;/i&gt;]. 

 In paragraph 6 of the same chapter, &lt;i&gt;Rambam&lt;/i&gt; teaches that a heretic [&lt;i&gt;apikuris&lt;/i&gt;] has no place in the afterlife of the righteous, and will be punished eternally.  

&lt;b&gt;CHRONOLOGY:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Rambam&lt;/i&gt; was born in 1134 CE in Córdoba, Spain and died in 1204 CE in Egypt.

&lt;b&gt;*** QUOTE 2 OF 3: ***&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pele Yoetz&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Perek Apikuris&lt;/i&gt; [Heretic]: &lt;/b&gt;
“And it is not even necessary to teach that a person who doubts the words of the Torah or the words of the Great Ancient Sages [&lt;i&gt;divrei Sofrim&lt;/i&gt;], or mocks even one word of the Torah or one word of the Great Ancient Sages [&lt;i&gt;divrei Sofrim&lt;/i&gt;], he is a complete heretic [&lt;i&gt;apikuris gamur&lt;/i&gt;]; and behold, he has abandoned the faith, and denied a foundation [of the Jewish faith]…”

&lt;b&gt;CHRONOLOGY:&lt;/b&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;Pele Yoetz&lt;/i&gt; was completed by Rabbi Eliezer Papo (&lt;i&gt;Sephardi Tahor&lt;/i&gt;) in Bulgaria on April 28, 1824 CE.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>*** QUOTE 1 OF 3: ***</b></p>
<p><b><i>Rambam</i>’s <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, chapter 3, paragraph 8:</b><br />
 If any Jew denies that even ONE WORD of the Torah is Divinely-revealed, then he or she is a heretic <i>apikuris</i>].   </p>
<p>In the same paragraph, <i>Rambam</i> teaches that any Jew who denies the Oral Law [<i>Torah SheBeAl Peh</i>] is also a heretic [<i>apikuris</i>]. </p>
<p> In paragraph 6 of the same chapter, <i>Rambam</i> teaches that a heretic [<i>apikuris</i>] has no place in the afterlife of the righteous, and will be punished eternally.  </p>
<p><b>CHRONOLOGY:</b><br />
<i>Rambam</i> was born in 1134 CE in Córdoba, Spain and died in 1204 CE in Egypt.</p>
<p><b>*** QUOTE 2 OF 3: ***</b></p>
<p><b><i>Pele Yoetz</i>, <i>Perek Apikuris</i> [Heretic]: </b><br />
“And it is not even necessary to teach that a person who doubts the words of the Torah or the words of the Great Ancient Sages [<i>divrei Sofrim</i>], or mocks even one word of the Torah or one word of the Great Ancient Sages [<i>divrei Sofrim</i>], he is a complete heretic [<i>apikuris gamur</i>]; and behold, he has abandoned the faith, and denied a foundation [of the Jewish faith]…”</p>
<p><b>CHRONOLOGY:</b><br />
<i>Pele Yoetz</i> was completed by Rabbi Eliezer Papo (<i>Sephardi Tahor</i>) in Bulgaria on April 28, 1824 CE.</p>
<p><b>*** QUOTE 3 OF 3: ***</b></p>
<p><b><i>Mishnah Berurah</i>, <i>siman</i> 126, <i>sif katan</i> 3:</b><br />
“Understand that according to all opinions [literally, according to the entire world], that if we know that he [a Jew] denies the Resurrection Of The Dead [<i>Techiyat HaMetim</i>], or that he does not believe in the future redemption [<i>Geulah HaAtidah</i>], and how much more so if he does not believe that the Torah is divinely revealed [<i>Min HaShamayim</i>], or [if he does not believe in] reward and punishment; [then] according to all opinions, he is a complete heretic [<i>Apikuris Gamur</i>], and it is forbidden to allow him to act as prayer leader [<i>Shaliach Tzibur</i>]…”</p>
<p><b>CHRONOLOGY:</b><br />
Rabbi Yisroel Meir <i>HaKohen</i> Kagan, was an Orthodox Rabbi who lived from 1838 CE to 1933 CE in Poland.  He wrote the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> from 1894 CE to 1907 CE.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Not sure what this all means. Authentic Judaism does (should?) consider Tanach and Hazal as authoritative (how this manifests in actual practice can be a matter of debate and discussion), so authority per se won&#039;t disappear. And to the degree to which is does within Modern Open Orthodoxy, we may witness a slide into neo-Conservatism. Also, group identification will not disappear, and this does entail adherence to certain norms which bespeak authority of a sort. That said, Judaism has actually been much more more dynamic, less monolithic, less static, than many are aware of today, especially those in the haredi world. For example, we find in the Book of Maccabees that men and women prayed together in synagogues. And yet R&#039; Moshe Feinstein said separation for davening is &quot;de&#039;oraitha&quot;. Another different sort of example: once the common practice was to eat cheese right after beef, doing qinuah hapeh in between, and now most Orthodox Jews are unaware that about 50% of the Rishonim held this way... the list showing that indeed many things have changed over the centuries goes on and on. This will keep on happening. Most are stuck in a very temporal perspective.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Now, authority must be based on sound reasoning and meaningful arguments&quot;

*eyeroll*  Did Rabbi Fink fail to notice that Donald Trump is the leading Republican candidate?

People don&#039;t care what&#039;s true.  Yes, things will change--they always have--but people aren&#039;t going to suddenly care about what&#039;s true just because of the Internet.  The Internet spreads misinformation just as fast as information; the antivax movement was born on and spread via the Internet.  Even pre-existing false things are barely affected.  The Mormon Church is doing fine despite the no-fooling viral popularity of this guy&#039;s letter: http://cesletter.com/

That letter is just a summation of what we know about the origins of the Mormon church.  How many Orthodox Jews do you know that have ever used the Internet to examine whether Orthodox Judaism is true?  Never mind what they&#039;d conclude, why did they never even think to, say, google it?  After all, they&#039;d probably say it&#039;s the most important thing in their life, and if &quot;authority must be based on sound reasoning and meaningful arguments&quot; surely they&#039;d apply it to the most important thing in their life?  But they don&#039;t, as you can tell by the fact that you&#039;d struggle to name a few who did.  They don&#039;t even read the books they say they believe are the only ones the only god wrote! (How many Orthodox Jews have read all of Tanach?  Can even accurately describe what&#039;s in each book?)

Authority is how people decide what they will believe, even when they&#039;re right.  When someone today says he believes the Earth is round, he&#039;s believing that for the same reason a peasant in 782CE would say she believes the world is flat.  How people form beliefs has not changed; it&#039;s just that today&#039;s guy happens to be right.  He believes in viruses he&#039;s never seen just as medievals believed in demons they&#039;d never seen, and he would fail horribly to justify how &quot;we&quot; know that viruses are real things, unlike demons.

I don&#039;t know how the Internet will change how authority is formed and maintained, but Rabbi Fink&#039;s utopian prediction that it will magically cause authority to be vested in truth via evidence and reason is naught but naivete.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#062;  I think the majority of MO Jews would not read an article about the Torah on Wikipedia, because it&#039;s heretical. There are plenty of heretical books out there, but most MO Jews ignore them because they&#039;re forbidden reading.

An important difference is that one doesn&#039;t usually stumble across books with heretical ideas, but you can easily come across a heretical article clicking links on Wikipedia (or elsewhere), and spending a few minutes reading an article while you&#039;re already reading things online is more likely than sitting down to read an entire book you happened to find.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Here’s the thing. The next generation of Modern Orthodox Jews are Millennials who grew up in a digital world where authority is routinely challenged. Fact-checking teachers was easy even when we had only Microsoft Encarta. Today, Google allows us to fact-check from our phones before the authority finishes their sentence. Now, authority must be based on sound reasoning and meaningful arguments, not fear or shame.&quot;

I wonder how much the Internet really changes things. There is so much readily accessible information online, yet Modern Orthodoxy still manages to insulate itself pretty well from all this.

I hope the Internet does have the effect you suggest in this article. I think it will definitely have some effect. I wonder how much though.

		<description><![CDATA[Ignoring the problems for a minute to focus on the logical structure of the argument. Just to clarify (and express for myself) that even if the Kuzari argument is strong, applying it to the question of God&#039;s existence would be weak. The argument is an inductive one which relies on probability. Thus, if there&#039;s inductive evidence against God&#039;s existence that is independent of the Kuzari argument, this would weaken the odds of the Kuzari argument being right, potentially making the argument weak. 

The interesting thing, from a logical standpoint, is if the Kuzari argument holds, God exists. But I might not be able to say that God exists; only that if God exists, the Jewish version of God is true. 

From what I&#039;ve heard, I suppose that Gottlieb would hold the Kuzari argument to be so strong as to have nearly the logical power of a deductive argument (problems notwithstanding--I haven&#039;t read the book to see how he deals with them). Thus, unless one has at least as concrete evidence against the proposition of God&#039;s existence, it would also be a strong argument for God&#039;s existence. 



I&#039;d appreciate a critique of my analysis. Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

My name is Aleksandr Sigalov. I am a Torah observant Jew. 


Sorry I am putting it here but I could not find your email address. You can delete this after you read it.

I really enjoyed your website and your blog and I wanted to invite you to my blog and see if you would be interested in featuring it on yours. I can do the same in return. Here is the link: thedeserttabernacle.blogspot.com

I am having difficult time reaching Orthodox Jewish community due to the fact that many Orthodox Jews do not use internet or use it very little. However, they would benefit most from materials published on my blog. This is why I was hoping you can help me.

The current problem in Orthodox Jewish community caused by the fact that they do not follow Written Torah, the only Law that was given to Jews by God.

There is no pure form of Judaism today, as all sects and denominations have added to the Torah. Samaritans have Joshuah, Karaites have NK (Neviim, Ketuvim), Rabbinic Jews have Talmud and derivative works, e.t.c. 

Not a single group follows the Law of God in its pure form, which is the Written Torah. They all follow man-made traditions and writings over the Written Torah. 

This is why many young Orthodox Jews leave the community as they can clearly see that it is all bullshit that has no basis in reality. This is why Orthodox Jews are stuck in the past with radical views on issues like technology (internet, phones), female sexuality, science, e.t.c.

All violence in Israel has the same root as well. The Written Torah should be the law of the land and the 10 commandments should be Israel&#039;s constitution. For native and for the sojourner as Shemot 12:49 states. Democracy or any other form of government, including Rabbinic Torah (Rabbinic Theocracy), will never work in Israel. Only Written Torah will, as it was specifically designed for that land. Written Torah is extremely clear that the only way we can live in peace in Israel is if we would live by it. This is the absolute condition.

I am a former Orthodox Jew myself and I was pretty disillusioned by Orthodox Judaism. This is why I follow and live only by the Written Torah now as it is the only true word of our God. As a chosen people and as priests to nations we must set an example and represent the best of the best. This is not the case at this time.

The reason I am appealing to you is to establish a dialog and try to help spread real Torah knowledge, incur change in this horrible situation, as well as to call for Jewish unity everywhere under one true Law of God.

Let me know what you think.

Notable articles that I published on my blog recently:

My Letters to Presidents

Making Shewbread with Shelley Houser

Exact Value of the Omer

New and Proper Translation of Decalogue

Proper Translation of the 7th Commandment

New Modern Literal Translation of Genesis/Bereshit

Printable Mezuzot

Sincerely,

Aleksandr Sigalov]]></description>
