		<description><![CDATA[Why don&#039;t you read what you wrote again and see how childish you sound. If you firmly believe that I or any other religious person is misguided and that we are harming our children by raising them in the same manner that we were raised, and if you really wanted to save us and our children from leading such a horrible, misguided lifestyle, you would be better off acting like an adult when you argue. You will never convince a single person of your argument if you act like a jerk (and thank god for that).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot; i think one of the rabbi&#039;s told a kid to go die. that&#039;s what i read on another blog.&quot;

And if true, that is absolutely horrible. Not sure how that relates to my point though. (as an aside, I highly doubt that actually happened- I have seen intolerant rabbis say some pretty stupid things in my life, but I&#039;ve never seen one tell someone to their face to go die- just seems quite bizarre).

&quot;it&#039;s just whether he can be heard. and of course he can be heard.&quot; Sure he should be heard. But he is no different than anyone else. If he speaks coherently and makes substantive points, then those points should be heard and addressed. If, however, he makes obnoxious and intolerant points without any substance, then those points should be treated the same way I would be treated had I made obnoxious and intolerant points. I am the one advocating for a single standard- it is Joshie who believes that different rules should apply to him than to his opponents. 

&quot;In the future, Milton, I hope the Jewish world let&#039;s all voices be heard. Let freedom ring. Let dignity for all people of goodwill reign as the supreme value.&quot;

Amen.]]></description>

anyway, it&#039;s not about joshie being right or wrong.  it&#039;s just whether he can be heard.  and of course he can be heard.  if i am going to listen to a rabbi tell me he knows Judaism is true, i NEED to listen to joshie when has information that shows the religion may be full of lies, distortions, omissions, supression of information.

In the future, Milton, I hope the Jewish world let&#039;s all voices be heard.  Let freedom ring.  Let dignity for all people of goodwill reign as the supreme value.  Let the kids make their own decisions about what conclusions to reach based on all informed voices.

That is the real shame of any religious community.  the control. the fear.  the ferocious need for walls.  And that isn&#039;t G-d talking to us -- that&#039;s just us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First off, thank you for confirming my understanding of your original post- that Judaism is a farce. I have no idea how Rabbi Fink understood you to be saying otherwise, but he did. 


Secondly, I have no idea who you are and I have never, to my knowledge, had a conversation with you before. It is quite possible you sometimes have valid points and when you make those valid point I would be happy to agree with you. I don&#039;t think voices like your should be shut out. I was responding to one specific comment you made, which was hateful and intolerant, and if i ever would have made similar remarks about those that are irreligious I would be widely condemned (and rightfully so) by everyone on this blog.  It&#039;s quite ironic that in a post criticizing the intolerance of some orthodox Rabbis, it&#039;s perfectly acceptable for you to say far worse things than these Rabbis would ever say. Tolerance, it seems, is only a one-way street here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot; I don&#039;t think those kids would be better off on the inside of this community&quot;

This is the ESSENCE of the problem! Not every person who grows up in an orthodox community is destined to remain within that community forever (I think that is obvious). BUT, the problem is that these particular kids grew up in Lakewood (or a community like Lakewood) where they aren&#039;t permitted to acquire the skills (or only acquire substandard skills) necessary to exit the community and create a life for themselves elsewhere. So, they are stuck living with their parents in the community, a community that they don&#039;t identify with anymore and are uncomfortable living within it, and the community members are uncomfortable with them living in it. But they&#039;re stuck between a rock and a hard place - live with their parents or what? Live on the street homeless? Move away and try to eke out a living with limited skills? What should they do? Where should they go? How should they live?


The whole situation is very sad, and a I lay a large portion of the blame on the leaders of that community that keep increasing their opposition to meaningful secular studies that could enable their youth to make a wider range of choices regarding their lives. Of course, those leaders, being power hungry, &lt;i&gt;don&#039;t want&lt;/i&gt; their youth to have choices.]]></description>

But they&#8217;re stuck between a rock and a hard place &#8211; live with their parents or what? Live on the street homeless? Move away and try to eke out a living with limited skills? What should they do? Where should they go? How should they live?</p>
<p>The whole situation is very sad, and a I lay a large portion of the blame on the leaders of that community that keep increasing their opposition to meaningful secular studies that could enable their youth to make a wider range of choices regarding their lives. Of course, those leaders, being power hungry, <i>don&#8217;t want</i> their youth to have choices.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A few points to give some context: the gathering you&#039;re referencing here occurred following a very different type of event that happened the previous Shabbos. The week before, the Satmar Dayan in Lakewood organized his people to go down to the Lake and vilify the kids hanging out there, heaping scorn and condemnation on them for their behavior in public. Lakewood&#039;s equivalent of Shomrim, (LCSW, comprised in part of many former beneficiaries of Rabbi Chaim Abadi&#039;s Minyan Shelanu program, geared towards teens who are struggling in the community) patrol the Lake even on Shabbos and called the police to keep an eye on things. Naturally the &quot;hafganah&quot; was not received well and the police ended up dispersing the crowd, even putting some of the worst offenders in the back of their squad car to remove them from the scene (which was met with glee by some of the teens, who jokingly shouted &quot;shabbos! Shabbos!&quot; after the receding car. I admit I found that pretty funny). The video that I believe your&#039;e referring to is actually from that Shabbos where the teens were confronted with contempt and scorn by total strangers.
I didn&#039;t hear about this past Shabbos, but judging by the picture you posted of the flyer, the attempt was an effort to counter the negative message put out the previous week. If you read the flyer carefully it requests participants to act respectfully to anyone they come into contact with during the gathering. I see this as a very positive (if not somewhat misguided) reaction to the events of the previous week; that R&#039; Olshin attached himself to the project by personally attending added gravitas to the effort in my eyes, and I&#039;m pleasantly surprised by the whole thing.

I run a drop-in center in Passaic, NJ. We have (by request; the dynamics in the community are somewhat sticky) flown under the radar and relied on word-of-mouth to allow the kids in need to get in touch with us - after all, their social network is more potent that any social media campaign we could muster. Periodically, though, our kids get into some trouble that pushes them into the public eye and we get a lot of backlash. It is very hard to counsel patience and tolerance to people who regard these kids as &quot;lost&quot; &quot;damaged&quot; &quot;broken&quot; &quot;messed up&quot; or any other adjective that places them into a heterogenous group. Time and again I challenge dissenters to engage ONE kid, spend some genuine time with them and they will find their perspective changed for the better - both for the kids and themselves.

Sorry for the digression. Lakewood has a way to go but I&#039;m seeing something potentially good happening...

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbonim, Roshei Yeshiva and askonim are easy targets. If a child has a loving, stable home - one that is intent on living the words of chanoch l&#039;naar al pi darko - creating an educational path appropriate for each child - then all the nuisances and shortcomings of well intentioned people will not affect them. When the child can no longer trust, find comfort and connect to his parents then all the Finkorswims in the world will not help. 
Sadly, we spend more time picking out an esrog - than learning how to be a good spouse (before marriage) and learning how to be the best parent. We just assume that it all comes naturally, to some it does, to many it does not. That is the fallout we see in Lakewood or Crown Heights or Boro Park.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t be silly, Mark. The blue shirted boys and the striped shirted boys are both already hopelessly Goyim. If anything, the second split will be to separate the white shirt/ black pants boys from the white shirt/ navy pants boys so that the white shirt/ navy pants boys cannot negatively influence the white shirt/ black pants boys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Most importantly, a more diverse school system should be established. I have a feeling that would be very helpful.&quot;


This one might happen. Because then they would have an easy way to get those blue-shirted boys away from the white-shirted boys before the blue-shirted boys can negatively influence the white-shirted boys.


Of course, a few years later they will have to create yet another school to separate out the striped-shirted boys from the blue-shirted boys before the striped-shirted boys can negatively influence the blue-shirted boys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Maybe it would be helpful if the rabbinic leadership of the yeshiva community sanctioned a yeshivish non-BMG community with its own leaders and community standards.&quot;


This is *very* unlikely to happen because, perhaps more than anything, the BMG hierarchy craves power and control. Basically, the king will never allow competition if he can prevent it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have read  many of Rabbi Fink&#039;s opinion pieces, I cannot remember one so decisive, thought provoking and correct.
In truth the Lakewood issues discussed are near universal.
I live in Crown Heights we struggle with similar circumstances.
The Rabbonim, Askanim and householders need to address all the underlying struggles being encountered, it will be a painfu processl but it is unavoidable. 
G-d will guide us as always.]]></description>
