		<description><![CDATA[&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rambam&lt;/i&gt;’s &lt;i&gt;Hilchot Teshuvah&lt;/i&gt;, chapter 3, paragraph 8:&lt;/b&gt; 

 If any Jew denies that even ONE WORD of the Torah is Divinely-revealed, then he or she is a heretic [&lt;i&gt;apikuris&lt;/i&gt;].   

In the same paragraph, &lt;i&gt;Rambam&lt;/i&gt; teaches that any Jew who denies the Oral Law* [&lt;i&gt;Torah SheBeAl Peh&lt;/i&gt;] is also a heretic [&lt;i&gt;apikuris&lt;/i&gt;]. 

 In paragraph 6 of the same chapter, &lt;i&gt;Rambam&lt;/i&gt; teaches that a heretic [&lt;i&gt;apikuris&lt;/i&gt;] has no place in the afterlife of the righteous, and will be punished eternally.   

What percentage of Reform Jews and Conservative Jews qualify for these categories?  

Last but not least:  

Since Orthodox Jews believe that the entire Torah is Divinely-revealed, why should they accept the validity of conversions that were performed by Reform Jews who reject the Divinely-revealed nature of the Torah?

Since Orthodox Jews accept the authority of Judaism’s Oral Laws, why should anyone expect them to accept the validity of conversions that were performed by Reform Jews who reject the authority of Judaism’s Oral Laws?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I 100% agree that R Shachter deserves better. But so does R Krauss, who&#039;s been counter-attacked by myriad internet voices as well. Perhaps not as insultingly as the attacks on R Schachter, but in a more insidious way, by belittling him and his right to be involved in this issue, and implying (and sometimes stating outright) that he is a lightweight who is naively in over his head.]]></description>
