		<description><![CDATA[You use the term &quot;hitting&quot; and &quot;beating&quot; interchangeably without acknowledging that they are two very different things. While my parents never hit me and I have never hit my children, I think you&#039;re being quite judgmental when you say things like, &quot; If you hit your kids, please stop. If you don’t stop, please stop telling people how great it is to hit your kids.&quot; You may prefer a specific parenting style but reasonable people are entitled to disagree (the sages of Talmud are some of the reasonable people that come to mind). Aren&#039;t you the one always arguing for diversity and decrying a one-size-fits-all approach?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you see this as a growing problem, with technology decreasing the attention span, leading to knee-jerk judgments and reactions?  I think a loving parent tries to give the child what they need. It seems the humiliation, not the physical violence, was the source of a possible change of direction in her son.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Like everything in life, there are exceptions to every rule. Is it wrong to beat your child? Yes. But beating is not the same as striking and I don&#039;t see anything wrong with hitting your child.  And if it gets to the point where a teen is actually &quot;doing&quot; bad, then a good &quot;controlled&quot; ass kick is not morally wrong, in my opinion. Now regarding fear, if it is fear alone that is driving child growth, than I do not believe it will last in the long run. But most parents do not raise children on fear alone. It&#039;s a component - and I believe a healthy one - of the chinuch that I believe can keep children on a right path. I mean, whether you like it or not, fear is always being used, especially in school. A young child is not going to behave in some particular setting if there is no fear of the morah backing it up. So I don&#039;t know. Are you talking about fear in general, or simply fear of getting hit?]]></description>
