		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Therefore a Christian should be content and not argue with the Jews. But if you have to or want to talk with them, do not say any more than this: &quot; Listen, Jew, are you aware that Jerusalem and your sovereignty, together with your temple and priesthood, have been destroyed for over 1,460 years? &quot; For this year, which we Christians write as the year 1542 since the birth of Christ, is exactly 1,468 years, going on fifteen hundred years, since Vespasian and Titus destroyed Jerusalem and expelled the Jews from the city. Let the Jews bite on this nut and dispute this question as long as they wish.

For such ruthless wrath of God is sufficient evidence that they assuredly have erred and gone astray. Even a child can comprehend this. For one dare not regard God as so cruel that he would punish his own people so long, so terribly, so unmercifully, and in addition keep silent, comforting them neither with words nor with deeds, and fixing no time limit and no end to it. Who would have faith, hope, or love toward such a God?&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[The basis for Jewish belief is the existence of the Nation of Israel (see the Kuzari).  You state that the religion of Judaism is dying out- and you are right.  Everywhere, Judaism and Jews are assimilation and dissapearing.  Except for one country, the population of Jews in the world is rapidly decreasing and the Jewish people will cease to exist.  However . . .
That one country is Israel.  In Israel, for the first time since the end of the FIRST temple, more Jews live in the Land of Israel than in any other place in the world.  Israel is on the fast track to becoming the location of more than half the Jews in the entire world!  This in a country the size of New Jersey . . .
The center of Jewish physical existence is necessarily the center of Jewish spiritual existance.  Judaism is not just a religion, but a religio-nation.  Judaism is therefore not dying, the Exile is dying.  The process of Redemption is happening before our eyes.  It is not an instantaneous process, but an inexorable process nonetheless.  Just as the prophets foretold, the People of Israel are returning to the Land of Israel.  This is the proof of God&#039;s existence-  His People, triumphing over their enemies.  His People, sovereign in their own land.  This is the core of Judaism.  This is the Glory of being a Jew.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Rabbi I was young Orthodox who specialized in Jewish apologetics. However, over time my beliefs in Torah have deteriorated. I have come to accept the documentary hypothesis as an undeniable fact. I feel I can no longer justify unconscionable genocide littered all over the Torah or the aggressive anti-gentile literature in the Talmud. Furthermore it has become obvious to me that most of the Jewish stories come from better stories plagarzied from sumerians, babylonians, egyptians, greeks, hittites, canaanites, assyrians and so forth. The sumerians had the story of enmerker and the tower of arratta, so Jews plagarized it to create the tower of babel. The greek had the story of Hercules and the Nameion lion, and so jews came up with the story of Samson.

Year and years of critical inquiry have led me to believe Judaism is a false, and just untrue religion.

However, what keeps me tied to Jewish practise is giult not belief. My grandparents paid miserably through Holocaust survival for their Judaism. If I go off the derech then I feel I am betraying my family and the suffering they went through to preserve their Judaism. Yet at the same time I feel I wish to be intellectually honest.

If and when I have children why should I raise them Jewish? I clearly believe Judaism is false, and none of the arguments in its favor convince me otherwise. I feel that Jews are becoming extinct fast with an ever growing apostate and intermarriage rate and that like all religions are reaching our end. Along with zorastrianism we are on the list of fastest dieing religions.

Can you give me, a non-believer knowing my situation, a reason to be Jewish and raise children Jewish?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@ E.F. Shaar:

Technically it is possible to get to the point at which the potential convert will &quot;complete&quot; the process in front of a Rabbinic Jewish Beis Din (court).

However, practically this is impossible and will be frowned upon by the Rabbinic Court. The reason for this is that to understand Judaism it is necessary to have a teacher. The system is designed this way purposely and you can learn more about this in my podcast called &lt;a href=&quot;http://rabbifink.wordpress.com/2008/12/22/intro-to-talmud-1/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Intro to Talmud 1&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, Judaism is an unbroken chain of communication from Sinai through the present to which a convert needs to connect. Reading in a book will give him the information necessary but the spiritual connection will be lacking. Again, this is not a prerequisite but a major obstacle to the practical application of Judaism. Therefore I would not recommend it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rabbi,

First off, I hope you&#039;re doing well.  Secondly, I was wondering if you could explain to me what happened with Enoch.  Why was he &quot;taken by G-d&quot; rather than having a normal death.  Similarly, why did this also happen to Eliyahu Hanovi?  Thanks for the help.  I look forward to hearing back from you.

All the best,
