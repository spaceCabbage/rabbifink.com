				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Small-Business-Saturday.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6539" title="Small-Business-Saturday" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Small-Business-Saturday-279x300.jpg" alt="" width="279" height="300" /></a>I wasn&#8217;t going to write a post about this so I did a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10101217351998665" target="_blank">short blurb on Facebook</a> (you can read the post and the excellent comments even if you don&#8217;t have Facebook). But the conversation was very enlightening and I have decided to do a post.</em></p>
<p>On Saturday, American Express sponsored Small Business Saturday (SBS). To help promote small businesses (and their brand) AMEX offered a $25 credit to anyone who used a registered AMEX card at a participating small business.</p>
<p>Many schools and charity organizations urged their supporters to register and donate $25 using their AMEX. This would give the institution a $25 (minus fees) donation and the donor would recoup the $25 from AMEX. So in essence it was a free $25 for the institution. Sounds like a win / win.</p>
<p>On its face, the participation of charities and religious institutions seems like it could be an issue. The concept here is to promote small business with purchases. &#8220;Spending $25&#8243; at a shul or school simply for the sake of a donation is  not within the spirit of the promotion. But reasonable people could argue this point.</p>
<p>The problem is that SBS has rules.<span id="more-6538"></span> <a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/0W3T2x183K0j1X3Q2536/amex-sbs-terms-2012.pdf" target="_blank">The rules state</a>:</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Program is only available to qualifying small businesses. For the purpose of this Program, qualifying small businesses include small, locally-owned storefront and online businesses with $10 million in annual revenue or less. Businesses in the following industries are excluded: government agencies, charities, non-profits, trade associations, shopping property management firms, political, religious and educational organizations.</em></p>
<p> It seems pretty clear that shuls, yeshivas, tzedaka organizations, and any other frum (or not frum) Not-For-Profit would not be eligible to participate in SBS. (And by the way, we were able to find a few Churches that asked for $25 donations on SBS).</p>
<p>But things are not so simple.</p>
<p>First of all, AMEX knows which vendors are NFPs or religious institutions. Yet, they accept SBS submissions from these vendors. This seems to be in defiance of their own rules. Further, at least a few institutions contacted AMEX and asked if they were in fact eligible for SBS and AMEX told them that they were eligible! Once again, AMEX defied their own rules. Complicating things even worse is the fact that AMEX told several other institutions that they were not eligible for SBS.</p>
<p>Turns out, AMEX has no idea what they are doing. Different organizations were told different things and they don&#8217;t even know their own rules. So what&#8217;s the verdict?</p>
<p>Here is what I think. If you asked AMEX and they said your organization is not eligible, there is no question that you should not be participating. Yes, that is even if they will accept your charges. Taking advantage of their mistake when you know that they are making a mistake is unethical. Sure, &#8220;<em>taus akum</em>&#8221; is permissible. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>should </em>take advantage. And it might only apply after the mistake happened, but to knowingly take advantage of a mistake is different.</p>
<p>If you asked AMEX and they said your organization is eligible and you did not know that their own rules said that your organization was not eligible, I have no problem with your organization participating in SBS. I don&#8217;t love it, but it&#8217;s hard for me to complain.</p>
<p>If you asked AMEX and they said your organization is eligible and you <em>did </em>know that their own rules said that your organization was not eligible, I think you should still refrain from participating in SBS. While it is true that someone at AMEX told you that you could participate, you knew that you could not participate. It seems difficult for me to sign off on that. Just because a call-center agent doesn&#8217;t know AMEX&#8217;s rules doesn&#8217;t exonerate you from following those rules. Imagine one idiot police officer told you that you could drive 80 in a clearly marked 55 MPH zone and another officer pulls you over for speeding. You&#8217;re not going to be able to blame it on the first officer. You&#8217;re going to get a citation. It&#8217;s not the exact same thing, but it&#8217;s close.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t ask AMEX if your organization could participate I think you might think that ignorance is bliss. But it&#8217;s not. If you are going to participate in a promotion like this, especially one that involves free money, you need to do your due diligence. You need to make sure you can participate. If you didn&#8217;t even care to look into it, I find that problematic.</p>
<p>I hope that at the very least, AMEX will clarify their position for SBS 2013 and the halachically conscious public will be sure to ascertain their eligibility before spamming their supporters to &#8220;spend $25&#8243; on a donation to their institution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/el-al.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6132" title="el-al" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/el-al-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Cross-posted to <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2012/08/what-to-do-if-you-got-one-of-those-el.html" target="_blank">DovBear</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Unless you live under a rock, you know that El Al made a big mistake and allowed people to buy round trip tickets to Tel Aviv from New York for under $400. This was not a promotion or a sale. It was a mistake.</p>
<p>When the mistake was corrected the fares disappeared.</p>
<p><a href="https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/580772_460150634007087_1221347527_n.jpg" target="_blank">El Al is honoring the tickets.</a></p>
<p>If you scored some of these tickets what is the proper thing to do?</p>
<p>In Moment Magazine, the Ethicist Emeritus, Randy Cohen, weighs in and says:<span id="more-6131"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>El Al should offer to honor all those tickets, and the customers should decline the offer.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>El Al, like other companies, has a duty to honor the advertised price. If it is a third party mistake, then El Al should seek compensation from that third party that actually made the error&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>However, even if El Al offers to make good on the tickets, we are not supposed to exploit someone.</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It may be a very bitter pill to swallow if you &#8220;lucked out&#8221; but your luck actually is causing someone else&#8217;s loss. While it is true that the loss is self inflicted by their mistake, that does not give one the right to take advantage of someone else. (Corporations are people too?)</p>
<p>I am fond of repeating what my rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Tendler said about decided whether a business deal was ethical or not. He said the deciding factor should be the answer to the question &#8220;would I do this deal to my brother?&#8221; If the answer is no, you shouldn&#8217;t do the deal with someone else.</p>
<p>If my brother accidentally advertised a product worth $1000 for $400 I would alert him to his error. I wouldn&#8217;t exploit his error.</p>
<p>Now this may be a lofty, unrealistic ideal. I admit as much. But I am only writing what I believe is the &#8220;right thing to do&#8221; not the &#8220;easy or acceptable thing to do&#8221;. Also, we are talking about a trip to the Holy Land here. Wouldn&#8217;t you want to visit Israel with a clear and clean conscience? I would.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in &#8220;finders keepers&#8221;. I believe in doing the right thing. I think the right thing to do here is for El Al to honor the tickets. It was their mistake. But people who got the tickets should ask El Al for their money back. If El Al is feeling generous, it might the nice if they would offer some incentive for not using the tickets, like elite status or free upgrades, or something like that.</p>
<p>Think about the Kiddush Hashem that would be created if we all agreed not to use the tickets. That has to be worth at least as much as a trip to Israel.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Ki Seitzei<br />
Honesty Counts</h2>
<p>Parshas Ki Seitzei is jam packed with mitzvos. Interestingly, it concludes with two seemingly unrelated mitzvos, the halachos of honest weights and measures and the requirement to remember what Amalek did to us when he attacked us following our geula from Mitzrayim. The smichos haparshiyos leaves a powerful reminder.</p>
<p>Chazal point out the obvious relationship between these two mitzvos. Simply, when yidden are honest Amalek has no shlitah. Honesty is always reflection for our bitachon in haKadosh Baruch Hu. Amalek only attacks when we are ayaf veyagaya velo yarey Elokim. As such, maintaining integrity in our business affairs is crucial. As it not only reflects our emuna, but it is the best preventive medicine we can employ to keep Amalek away.</p>
<p>But there is more.<span id="more-4589"></span> The pasuk expands the description of the unscrupulous business man and calls kol osei avel, all those who behave badly as deserving of the same consequences as those who are dishonest. In fact, the Sifrei darshans that these people are defined with five uncomplimentary terms; avel, sanui, meshukatz, cheirem and toeiva. These are very powerful words characterizing those who take advantage of others for personal gain. The implication is self explanatory. Those who wish not to be called a toeiva should exercise caution and propriety to be able to answer the question of nasasa venatata beemuna positively.</p>
<p>The Malbim takes it a step further. He understands these five descriptors from avel to toeiva as a progression. One leads to the other. When an individual has a breakdown in his business ethics, then he is more than at risk for having a breakdown in other areas of his mitzvah observance. He is on the fast track to “toeiva-hood”, being an abomination in the eyes of Hashem for all sorts of disgusting behavior. Cheating can lead even to murder once the breakdown in ethical behavior begins.</p>
<p>This message need not be lost during the month of Elul. Small failures in ethical behavior create large chasms of spiritual deficit.</p>
<p>The opposite is also true. Working on our integrity we can help shut down the access to all that is evil and make it easier to refine our character in avodas Hashem. This idea is part of what we remember when we are mekayem the mitzvah of zachor es asher asa lecha Amalek. It is why it is one of the shesh zichronos. We not only remember what Amalek did, but we remind ourselves of what invites his behavior.</p>
<p>May we be zoche to be inspired so that our ethical conduct is always above reproach. Leman yareechun yamecha and be blessed with the areechas yamim that the Torah promises to all those who are honest.</p>

Here in LA, we are famous for our looters. Rodney King, OJ Simpson, Lakers win, Lakers lose, all seem like legitimate reason for looting in LA&#8230;</p>
<p>But it seems that in Japan there is no looting going on. I can&#8217;t verify this. I can only report what I am hearing from the media.</p>
<p>If this is true, it is astounding.</p>
<p>I am very impressed with the level of civility that is required for no one to be looting. In tough situations humans often resort to their basest insincts. <span id="more-3929"></span>Of those, is the fend for oneself to the exclusion of others. Looting is taking care of yourself and ignoring the rules of society and civilization simply because you can, or worse, because you must.</p>
<p>Japan is handling this tragic disaster superbly. And the absence of looting is consistent with the overall approach I have seen in the wake of the tragedy.</p>
<p>If you want to wade through thousands of reader comment to The Telegraph about why they think there is no looting check out the blog post <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/edwest/100079703/why-is-there-no-looting-in-japan/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>But beware there is tons of racist and bigoted comments. Nor is it likely the actual answer will found there. But you never know&#8230;</p>
<p>Kudos to Japan (my third favorite country) for setting the standard of moral and honest behavior in tragedy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gutenberg-bible.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3882" title="gutenberg-bible" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gutenberg-bible-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>There is a very prominent version of the English Bible that got a bit of a make-over week. There were some very notable changes that I think are worth some commentary.</p>
<p>How do these changes come about? About 50 scholars from all faiths have been working on this since 1994. I guess they need to agree or come to a sort of consensus. But it is interesting that 50 humans get the decision as to how words in the Bible will be translated for the next generation.</p>
<p>The scholars claim that the changes don&#8217;t really mess with the meaning of the Bible. They are just making adjustments that account for changes in language over the last few decades. For the most part these changes are needed and correct. For example, holocaust was used to describe certain sacrifices (not humans, obviously) and it has been changed to &#8220;burnt offerings&#8221;. A wise move in my opinion.<span id="more-3881"></span></p>
<p>Another good choice was changing &#8220;booty&#8221; to &#8220;spoils of war&#8221; because booty now means something completely different to most folks. (Or maybe not)</p>
<p>But the most significant change is the translation of the passage in Isaiah that supposedly foretells the virgin birth of Jesus. Believe me, I have gone at this with missionaries many times. They have always insisted that <em>Alma</em> means virgin. Well, lo and behold, the new edition correctly translates <em>Alma</em> as a &#8220;young woman&#8221;.</p>
<p>So is that it? Will missionaries stop proving the birth of a Jesus was predicted by Isaiah? Who knows.</p>
<p>And for the record, this translation DOES NOT indicate any change of stance on the virgin birth by the scholars. &#8220;None whatsoever&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well it seems hard to see how it won&#8217;t. But either way, honesty is a good thing. Accurate translations are a good thing. Hopefully missionaries will stop using that verse incorrectly to make their point.</p>
<p>Of course, sales will skyrocket for the new edition. After all, the Bible is a best seller.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></em></p>
<h2>Parshas B’shalach<br />
“Heavenly Bread”</h2>
<p>After Krias Yam Suf, Hashem Yisborach responds to Klal Yisrael’s complaints for food by delivering them the mon. As a part of the process, He communicates to Moshe Rabbeinu what is to be an eternal lesson. The miracle of the mon was a six day per week experience. Rather than provide a bushel full of food to last for weeks, Hashem instructs v’laktu d’var yom b’yomo — Bnai Yisrael should gather (food) each day. This requirement is necessary, the posuk explains, l’maan annasenu hayeilech b’Torasi im lo — to test Klal Yisrael if they will follow the Torah or not.” Why, we may ask, the need of a test? Secondly, how is it connected to the mon? Finally it seems that this test is measuring emunah, why is it described in terms of hayeilech b’torasi  — following the Torah?<span id="more-3643"></span></p>
<p>The Mifarshim derive a powerful message from here. The most powerful measure of our commitment to Torah is found in our pursuit of parnassah — earning a livelihood. Too often, when it comes to the workplace, people make compromises in the standards Hashem demands from us in the Torah. It is as if they feel r”l that Hashem is unaware. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are reminded v’laktu d’var yom b’yomo lma’aan annasenu We must measure up to earn our keep every day. Even before Matan Torah, netzach Yisrael was being built on this maxim. The mon was distributed by Hashem and collected by the individual daily. Its flavor was determined by the values and taste of the recipient. And the amount of mon  which was delivered and the effort needed to collect it was a reflection of the quality of hayeilech b’Torasi as measured by the mitzvos and maasim tovim performed by the individual the previous day. This reinforced a constant dependence on Hashem. It can help keep us motivated to be ever vigilant in “following the Torah” through our Mitzvah observance, and personification of middos tovos in the work place.</p>
<p>At the revelation at Sinai described in next week’s parsha, Hashem gifted us with the tools needed to reach the loftiest realms of kedusha. Mon, the Heavenly bread, teaches us that through the seemingly mundane earthly process of earning a living we must feel His presence. In so doing we can IY”H merit His presents; brachos of parnassah, life, health and Nachas from our children, ad meah v’esrim shana.</p>

<p>Anyone who knows about technology, knows that the latest and greatest gadgets are all in Las Vegas right now for the consumer electronics show. The Atlantic is covering the show and found something they deemed newsworthy that is not directly related to &#8220;Consumer Electronics&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are chasidic Jews at the show.</p>
<p>Chasidic Judaism is often misdefined as &#8220;Ultra-Orthodox Judaism. It&#8217;s not. It is simply a way of life that focuses on the spirituality of the world and comes with a certain dress code. The men keep their beards, wear long coats and fur hats on holy days. But within chasidic Judaism, some are more &#8220;pious&#8221; than others. Being a chasidic Jew does not mean that one is more religious or more holy. It is a way of Jewish life that provides opportunities for religiousness or holiness, just like any other.</p>
<p><span id="more-3619"></span>At CES, the chasidic Jews are not developing new products. That would take an expertise that nearly all chasidic Jews do not have (ie heavy training in engineering and technology). Instead they are there as the classic Jewish middlemen. Using their connections and (hopefully) trustworthiness to develop relationships that can get them good prices on electronic goods and sell them to the marketplace at a fair price.</p>
<p>I think it is a common error to assume that chasidic Jews do not have regular jobs. True, there are scarcely any chasidic Jews who are professionals. College and secondary education are shunned. But nearly all chasidic Jews work. They are small business owners, they work in the services industry and they wheel and deal as middlemen.</p>
<p>I am proud that chasidic Jews are at CES. One of the men at the show was asked by the Atlantic if being chasidic impacts his business. He replied: <em>&#8220;People look at us as very honest people&#8221;</em>. That&#8217;s more important than any degree or faux religousness.</p>
<p>That is called making a kiddush Hashem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1134" title="Ethics" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/law7-300x239.gif" alt="Ethics" width="300" height="239" />Lawyers take the brunt of  a lot of <a href="http://www.lawlaughs.com/money/legalethics.html" target="_blank">jokes</a> and <a href="http://www.lawlaughs.com/honesty/howmuch.html" target="_blank">jabs</a> questioning their ethics.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Law Schools actually teach Ethical Lawyering and every student is required to pass that class prior to taking the bar.</p>
<p>Law blog <a href="http://legalgeekery.com/" target="_blank">Legal Geekery</a> (recommended reading for law students) has an article criticizing the way Law Schools attempt to teach ethics to future lawyers.</p>
<p><span id="more-1131"></span>In short, the argument goes (<a href="http://legalgeekery.com/2009/09/09/law-school-ethic/" target="_blank">read here</a>), by testing law students with proctors in the room, law students are not taught how to make ethical choices. Also, exams are taken on a software that locks the test taker&#8217;s computer while they take the exam. Instead, the schools should trust students the same way they will need to be trusted when they are in the work force with no proctor watching them. By watching every move the students make, Law Schools in effect, leave Law Students unprepared for the &#8220;real world&#8221;.</p>
<p>It got me thinking. Judaism is full of rules and regulations. The Torah is basically a really tough rule book. Does keeping the Torah&#8217;s laws help one become more ethical? Using the argument on Legal Geekery, the answer is no. Just because I act ethically because I fear retribution does not help me make ethical decisions when there is no fear of retribution.</p>
<p>But I disagree. I think practice makes <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">perfect</span> better. The Torah and its commandments are practice for the not-directly-related-Torah world when we do not have explicit rules and regulations to abide by. When we train our minds and bodies to act a certain way those thoughts and actions can become second nature. Second nature is pretty powerful. In fact, I recently mentioned in a Sermon that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elyah_Lopian" target="_blank">Rabbi Elyah Lopian</a> held that second nature is stronger that our inborn tendencies. Our inborn tendencies are more easily changed than our bad or good habits. That is why good habits are so important. Rabbi Lopian explains that the commandments are tools for developing those good habits.</p>
<p>I see some strong parallels to Law School.</p>
<p>Law School is about developing good habits for Law Practice. Developing good habits for reading and briefing cases and developing good habits for analyzing facts and policies are what Law School is all about. Ethical Lawyering is the same. Developing good habits in ethics is good &#8220;practice&#8221; for &#8220;practice&#8221;. Doing your own work, solving problems on your own and using only permissible resources are good practice for becoming an ethical lawyer. Making honesty a habit will serve you well in practice. When ethics become second nature we can take away the training wheels and let you ride on your own with no proctor.</p>
<p>The proctor is training you. If you practice, you will make honesty second nature.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This post is cross-posted to <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a> &#8211; more discussion there</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I read an important column on a good website yesterday.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t on NYTimes.com or Yahoo.com or ESPN.com (some of my favorite sites to link from) this article was on <a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/" target="_blank">Vosizneias.com</a>. VIN is a Orthodox Jewish blog with editorials and news. I recommend checking it out when you have a chance.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/35083/2009/07/15/new-york-baalei-teshuva-turned-off-by-e2809cfrume2809d-people-engaging-in-corrupt-behavior/" target="_blank"> column I read was a great perpective on Baal Teshuvas</a> and their integration into the Frum community. In particular the column focused on various reactions of the BT (I use the term adoringly) when encountered with other (supposedly) Frum Jews who are not living up to their own standards.</p>
<p><span id="more-872"></span>Some BTs &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmNopAo0PRc&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">can&#8217;t handle the truth</a>&#8221; and wind up right where they started &#8211; wonderful secular people. Other BTs are more adept at maintaining their Frum lifestyle despite the disappointment. The article then enumerates some of the great things that BTs have contributed to the Frum lifestyle. Like manners, healthy eating, special education, etc.</p>
<p>While there is room for debate on whether the Frum community can attribute these &#8220;innovations&#8221; to BTs I am happy to give them the credit.</p>
<p>The article concludes by thanking the Frum community for showing them a way of life they love and appreciate.</p>
<p>I have two main points that I want to make in relation to this article.</p>
<p>1- The fake sales pitch the Frum From Birth Kiruv Rabbis spew.</p>
<p>2- The BTs reaction to the reality check.</p>
<p>I cannot stand the sales pitch that Frum people have no problems and Torah life is free from all social ills. It is simply not accurate. Please don&#8217;t use it!</p>
<p>In fact, the Torah is a guidebook for flawed people. If people were able to just become perfect then the Torah would give us one time instructions to &#8220;fix&#8221; our flaws and then we would be good to go! But instead, the Torah gives us instructions to develop our character through Mitzva observance with specific tasks. Some tasks only come around once in a lifetime, or once every 50 years, or once every seven years, or once a year, or once a month, once a week, once a day, and even every second. The clear message is that we need constant work because humans will eventually fall.</p>
<p>The Talmud explicitly states: &#8220;Do not believe in yourself (righteousness) until the day you die&#8221;. The human being is designed to fail without constant work and guidance.</p>
<p>I believe the honest sales pitch (and yes it is a sales pitch and that&#8217;s okay) is: Humans are flawed, we all need guidance, the Torah provides guidance. Some of it is obvious, some of it is hidden, but we believe that the Torah lifestyle is a guide for life. If you want a guide, you can buy in. We are all trying to use the guide as best as we can and we feel our lives are more enriched by using the guide. Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important is the reaction of the BT. I sent this email to <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/juddmag" target="_blank">Judd Magilnick</a>, a<a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank"> Pacific Jewish Center</a> board member and he offered some great insight.</p>
<p>First, many &#8220;not yet&#8221; BTs back off from greater commitment by rationalizing that they saw a Frum person who lacked derech eretz (common courtesy). Judd says this is the Yetzer Hara talking but Frum folks need to realize that they are being judged and should act accordingly.</p>
<p>I once heard that R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein asked why we ask in Ahava Rabba that Hashem give us the ability to understand, listen to and teach Torah. Should the teaching part be reserved for teachers and rabbis? Why does veryone say it? And R&#8217; Moshe answers that we are all teachers. We are teaching others about how the Torah wants us to behave every time we act.</p>
<p>Judd&#8217;s next point was even better. Why should an impious Frum person affect one&#8217;s opinion of Torah? The analogy is if one sticks his wet finger in a socket he is going to get a shock. That doesn&#8217;t indicate a flaw in elecricity! And like electricity Torah has the power to do great good and it also has the power to cause ill. It depends on its user.</p>
<p>So (potential) BTs, if you can use Torah for good why would you let it bother you that someone else is abusing it? One has nothing to do with the other!</p>
<p>As a Rabbi in shul of mostly BTs and potential BTs I hear this kind of rhetoric often. &#8220;If he&#8217;s a Frum person he shouldn&#8217;t do X or Y etc&#8221;. It is disheartening but I have one response.</p>
<p>I always quote Rabbi Wein: &#8220;Don&#8217;t judge Judaism by its Jews&#8221;.</p>
<p>Additionally, I don&#8217;t <em>pitch</em> anything other that learning more Torah and experiencing a Shabbos meal. One should make their personal decisions based on an informed view that can only come from one&#8217;s own study. The Shabbos meal is just to make it a little more personal and less abstract. That&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>So, I am looking for insight, do people really judge Torah by its Jews?</p>
<p>Is there an &#8220;accurate&#8221; (non-cynical) sales pitch?</p>
<p>Anything else in the original column that struck you?</p>
