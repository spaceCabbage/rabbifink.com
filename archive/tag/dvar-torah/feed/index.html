				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em>“I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life, so that you may live, you and your children.”</em> &#8211; Deuteronomy 30:19</p>
<p>As we near the end of the life and times of Moses, his speech to the Israelites picks up steam and power. One of the most profound statements in the Torah is found near the beginning of this week’s parsha. Moses tells the Israelites that heaven and earth bear witness that Moses has given the Israelites a choice. The ultimate choice. They can choose life or they can choose death. Then in dramatic fashion, the people are then instructed to choose life.<span id="more-7592"></span></p>
<p>Choose life! To life! <em>L’chaim</em>! This is the essence of Judaism. We toast to life. We sing to life. Life is a gift and we choose to use it well. The life we are given is a life of choices. We are instructed to make the choices that are the choices of life. It is so simple, yet so profound. Especially when we consider the religious leanings of the ancients, where death was so integral to their religions, where human sacrifice was normal, the Torah’s charge to choose life bellows loudly with its profundity and its eternal message echoes across the millennia.</p>
<p>This verse is an example of the best of the Bible. Its dramatic overtones staking out the all encompassing issues of the human experience. When our souls feel lost we must always remember to choose life. That is the great compass of Judaism. Find life and go that way. Choose life!<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7593" alt="choices" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/choices-600x449.jpg" /></p>
<p>For all its drama in the Bible, the Talmud brings this verse back down to earth with a shocking thud. Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva have a dispute about just what it means to choose life. Rabbi Yishmael says that “life” refers to a trade or a craft &#8211; the ability to earn a livelihood. We are being instructed to choose a means to make a living. Rabbi Akiva says that life refers to matters of safety and recreation like swimming and boating. Ti him, choosing life means taking care of one’s physical condition and making certain that one is prepared for a physical world that carries with it inherent danger.</p>
<p>These interpretations, while utilitarian and wise, seem to be so impossible to hear in the context of the verse that we are left to wonder if these great rabbi can actually be serious. Moses is building to a crescendo in his speech and he takes a break from the sublime to discuss career options and water sports? The verse was so powerful in its basic meaning, where is the depth and the beauty now?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is yes. Indeed, it is sublime to live a life engaged in the world. That is the climax. That is the greatest life that can be chosen. We are to be active participants in the economic and social structure of our world and to do so ever mindful and aware of G-D and one’s Judaism &#8211; that is life! To choose life is to to live a life. An actual life. A normal, productive, material life. When one lives that life to its fullest and lives one’s Judaism to the fullest we are truly choosing life.</p>
<p>Choosing life does not mean that one should cut their self off from society. Life is to live amongst men and women. But to live this life elevated and infused with spirituality as one lives amongst others &#8211; that is to choose life. There is a place for meditation and reflection or even temporary complete immersion into Torah and purely spiritual pursuits. But <em>u’vacharta b’chaim</em> &#8211; to choose life &#8211; is only when that is firmly welded to material pursuits and responsibility.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yishmael was the same great sage who famously argued with Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. In his statement about the topic of working for a living, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai taught that one should do G-D’s will and their work will be performed by others. Rabbi Yishmael argued that one should work the land and earn a livelihood. His views on this matter are clear. Life is to work.</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiva attached himself to Bar Kochba. He was not satisfied living under the rule of a despotic and anti-Semitic Roman government. He dreamed of autonomy and safety. The idea was to rise up and rebel militarily. With weapons and men at arms. Rabbi Akiva did not rely on his piety or Torah study to protect him or the people. Nor did he assume that his Torah study would be sufficient to restore the land into Jewish hands. Rabbi Akiva supported a physical army in addition to the merits of Torah and Mitzvos.</p>
<p>Choose life means choose to live a life engaged in the world all the while meticulously adhering to G-D’s word and living a life of Torah, Mitzvos and <em>Kiddush Hashem</em>. Indeed, this is a profound statement worthy of placement in the climactic peak of this speech of Moses. It is not just life, it is our way of life.</p>
<p>Speaking to his congregation following the Woodstock Festival in 1969, Rabbi Lamm talked about Hippie culture as compared to Judaism. Hippies believed that life was an opportunity to “live it up.” Love, music, and drugs were pathways to nirvana in their worldview.</p>
<p>To this, Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva respond and say we choose life with work. To live means to earn a livelihood. To live means to be prepared for life’s difficult moments. The truly virtuous life is not the life of shortcuts and temporarily highs. When we choose life we are choosing to live a life of challenges. We meet those challenges with Torah principles along with secular training. When we are able to navigate the difficult moments in our lives, when we can grow from trying times, when we use our gifts and talents to transcend the material world, then we are truly choosing life.</p>
<p>Hippies are passé. Woodstock a distant memory. But contemporary society has adopted so much of that worldview into modern thinking. Freedom and love are enough to give meaning to life and they are enough to truly live. Our response is that to truly find freedom and love we must work to get there. That is how we choose life. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<div>“And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angered, and swore, saying: Surely there shall not one of these men, even this evil generation, see the good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em>“And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angered, and swore, saying: Surely there shall not one of these men, even this evil generation, see the good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers. […] Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying: Thou also shalt not go in either;” &#8211; Deuteronomy 1:34-35, 37</em></p>
<p>Moses spend his final days exhorting the Israelites to follow the word of G-d. In addition to his encouragement, Moses reminds the Israelites of their short history and the events that brought them to this juncture on the banks of the Jordan River about to enter the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>The book begins with a recap of the story of the spies. Moses fills in some of the blanks in the story in this retelling of the tale. The people are reminded that none of the sinners from the incident would be entering the Land of Israel. Interestingly, Moses includes himself in those who would not be entering the Promised Land due to the sin of the spies.<span id="more-7376"></span></p>
<p>The problem is that the Torah tells us in Parshas Chukas that Moses would not enter the Land of Israel because of his sin at Mei Meriva. When Moses was supposed to draw water from a rock by speaking to it he sinned and that is the reason he was banned from the land. It was not because of the spies. What are we to make of these remarks by Moses? Why is he saying he won’t be going to Israel as a punishment for the incident with the spies?<img class="size-medium wp-image-7377 alignright" alt="Moses_Pleading_with_Israel" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Moses_Pleading_with_Israel-437x600.jpg" width="437" height="600" /></p>
<p>Throughout the sojourn in the desert, the Israelites doggedly complained to Moses. They were relentless. If it wasn’t water, it was bread. If it wasn’t bread, it was meat. If it wasn’t meat, it was vegetables. There was always something to complain about. Indeed, the Israelites logged numerous complaints to Moses.</p>
<p>R’ Schwab says that if we look at all the complaints, we notice that they all shared one common thread. The people repeatedly accused Moses of taking them out of Egpyt to die in the desert. They asked time after time “Why have you taken us out of Egypt?”</p>
<p>The essence of this complaint is that Moses was a rebel leader who decided on his own to flee Egypt. The people were blaming Moses for their circumstances. In order for this complaint to make sense the assumption must be that Moses was not following G-d’s word, rather he was doing as he pleased. When he was caught in a bind, the people called him on his supposed recklessness.</p>
<p>During the incident of the spies, the people complained to Moses. They said: And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them: &#8216;Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would we had died in this wilderness! &#8211; Number 14:2</p>
<p>It is the familiar canard. Moses was to blame for their troubles with the spies as well.</p>
<p>This despite the baselessness for their accusation. Moses was acting upon the word of G-d. He had no say in the itinerary. He was as much a passenger on the journey as the rest of the people. But still, he was being blamed. Worse, he was being accused of acting on his own accord and thus he was culpable.</p>
<p>Human nature is such that hearing something over and over again for forty years will inevitably have an impact on the person. It’s impossible for it not to make an impression on the person’s psyche. It’s not quite brainwashing, but it’s a similar principle. When we are told a lie so many times over the course of so many years it begins to wear on us. We start to think that it might even be true. We start to believe the negative publicity.</p>
<p>Maybe Moses heard these accusations so many times over the course of the last 40 years that he started giving them some credence. Their accusation that he did things on his own without the approval of G-d took it’s toll. He started to think that maybe he was doing things on his own.</p>
<p>That is why he hit the rock instead of talking to the rock. Moses made the colossal error of thinking that he was the one doing the decision making and not G-d. Subconsciously, he decided to hit the rock to do it his own way. For this he was punished.</p>
<p>Now, while recounting the story of the spies and the accusation that he was a lone ranger acting without G-d’s approval Moses tells the people how much he was affected by their complaints. He tells the Israelites that their constant complaining had an effect on him and when he hit the rock part of it was because of what the Israelites had been saying to him for all those years.</p>
<p>The reason Moses was punished was because he hit the rock. But maybe the reason he hit the rock was because of the sort of complaints he had been subject to for 40 years. Case in point, the sin of the spies and the accusations and insults which accompanied the incident. Moses was told too many times that he was a renegade leader. Eventually his mind fooled him into believing it, if only for just a millisecond. But the damage was done. Moses hit the rock. Thus Moses mentions that he has been punished and will not be entering the Land of Israel while recounting the story of the spies.</p>
<p>In our lives we hear a lot about ourselves. Our parents and teachers tell us what they think about us. Friends and acquaintances make us aware of their opinions. Bosses and co-workers may express their feelings about us. Spouses and children tell us all that we need to know about ourselves. What they say might be true, it might not be true, but it definitely makes a difference.</p>
<p>We have to place ourselves in situations where we hear the right things about ourselves. Too much praise or too much criticism can make a real impression on our own thoughts about ourselves. Whether it artificially inflates our sense of self-worth, or if it artificially deflates our self-confidence, what other say about us makes a difference. It is wise for us to consider our social environment and analyze how we are being talked about in our daily lives.</p>
<p>Conversely, we have a huge responsibility to think about what we say about others. When it comes to our children, we have so much to say about them. Are we critical? Are we honest about their failings? Do they hear how much we love them? Do they hear how proud we are of their accomplishments? Do they hear a barrage of criticism? Do they get reminded of their shortcomings or negative personality quirks regularly?</p>
<p>We have so much power over what our children think of themselves. It would be wise for us to maximize their feelings of confidence and imbue them with an honesty about rising up to their challenges. What we say about them in person and what they hear us say about them will make a very big difference in the way they think about themselves.</p>
<p>The Jewish people as a whole are routinely discussed in the public arena. They say we are too much or this, or too little of that. We hear Jews being talked about it all the time. We read descriptions of Jewish people or Jewish ideas. Hearing lies over and over will take a toll on our collective psyche. We need to be sure that we do not believe everything we hear about ourselves. We cannot allow negativity dictate our communal mood.</p>
<p>It can be hard to stonewall what we hear about us as a group or as individuals. But being aware of the potential harm in believing our own publicity is the first step in avoiding it.</p>
<p>Above all, we cannot neglect our incredible opportunity to positively shape how others think about themselves. There is no part of our lives that this is more important that how we deal with our children and spouses. Let us use this knowledge to shower those closest to us with love, affection, positivity, and honesty. <em>- Good Shabbos</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><i><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/torah_study.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7237" alt="torah_study" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/torah_study-300x223.jpg" width="300" height="223" /></a>“Concerning this it is told in the account of the Wars of the Lord, &#8220;What He gave at the [Sea of] Reeds and the streams of Arnon.” &#8211; Numbers 21:14</i></p>
<p>The Torah connects the miracles at the Sea of Reeds with the miracles at the streams of Arnon. We are very familiar with the splitting of the sea and the drowning of the Egyptians as the waves crashed down upon them. At the streams of Arnon, Amonites and Moabites were waiting for the Israelites and planned to ambush them. G-D saved the Israelites by crushing the soldiers lying in wait with the mountains they were using for cover. The twin peaks merged together destroying the people lying in wait. The verse tell us that these fantastic miracles are recorded in the book of the Wars of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Hebrew words for “what He gave at [the Sea of] Reeds” are “et vahev b’Sufa.” In the Talmud, our Sages ask what <i>drasha </i>we can learn from the words in Psalms (127) “et oyvim b’shaar &#8211; the enemies at the gates?” The Talmud answers in name of R’ Chiya bar Abba that even a father and son or a teacher and student that study Torah in one gateway become enemies when they argue about the Torah and they do not budge from their position until they love one another, as the verse says “et vahev b’Sufa.” Rashi explains that the Talmud is referencing the mention of the book of the Wars of the Lord and is playing on the word vahev which is similar to the word ahava &#8211; love, and is saying that the battles of Torah (the Wars of the Lord) end in love.</p>
<p>R’ Schwab asks the obvious question here. This is a very farfetched <i>drasha.</i> What possible connection could there be between the splitting of the seas, the crushing of potential ambushers by way of mountains, and the intense study of Torah with a partner?<span id="more-7236"></span></p>
<p>We can understand the teaching of the Talmud if we examine the true nature of the miracles being referenced here. There were several miracles at the Sea of Reeds, but the miracle recognized here is the demise of the Egyptians in the raging waters of the sea. The waters split for the sake of the Israelites. It was a necessary measure to save the Israelites from certain death. Once the danger passed there was no longer a need for the miracle and the miraculous forces that were keeping a dry path in the sea stopped holding the waters back. As soon as there was no force splitting the sea, the waters returned to their natural, original position and the Egyptians drowned in the crashing waters.</p>
<p>Similarly, the miracle at Nachal Arnon was the merging of two mountains to crush the enemy. In essence, says R’ Schwab, the two mountains were really one mountain with two peaks. They were supposed to be one mountain but were only two peaks for the sake of giving a path for the Israelites to pass. To crush the would-be ambush all that was required was a suspension of the miracles separating the two peaks. Once the force keeping the mountain in two parts stopped, the mountain naturally crushed the ambush.</p>
<p>When fathers and sons or teachers and students study Torah they become enemies. They take different positions on matters of great importance. They disagree on the correct understanding, message, or interpretation. They argue for their point of view and fight for their position. It looks like there is a legitimate war. But the truth is that this schism is a mirage. Their true status is a state of peace and love. It’s just that through arguing in the Battles of Torah they take positions that are at odds. Love is their natural position.</p>
<p>The Talmud is saying that the same way the waves crashing on the Egyptians and the mountains crushing the ambushers was the previously held unnatural state returning to its natural state, “et vahev b’Sufa” can refer to the natural state of love between opponents in the Battles of the Torah. Even though they appear to be at odds, they are really only temporarily arguing. Their true state is peace, love, and harmony. The <i>drasha </i>is not so farfetched after all.</p>
<p>Never in the history of the Jewish people have so many people had the opportunity to hear so many different perspectives and ideas about Judaism. Hundreds and thousands of years ago, people were exposed only to the small group of people they knew personally. Eventually, books were published with slight variances of tradition and thought but generally speaking, people knew what they knew and they did what they did. Our modern society has opened the floodgates of information. This is a great blessing. We have access to more Torah than we ever had before. But we must now contend with many more competing views of religion in general, Judaism, and Orthodox Judaism. As a group we have a lot of opinions and we are passionate about our ideas.</p>
<p>Sometimes the discussions and disagreements can get heated. After all, it is the Battle of the Torah otherwise known as the Wars of the Lord! There is so much at stake and there is so much to learn and to discuss. We all have opportunities to hear new ideas and learn from others. We also have a chance to share our perspectives and opinions. This is wonderful. But we cannot forget that despite our differences, they are only superficial. Disagreement is not our natural state. Our arguments are only for the sake of Torah and G-D. We must be sure that when our arguments end we find ourselves in our natural state of peace, love, and harmony.</p>
<p>What a poignant thought for our generation. In a world of international discussion and debate via the Internet we can never forget that when our learning is over we leave the conversation with the love of a father to a son. Certainly, in our face to face interactions, Shabbos table discussions, coffee room shmoozing, and of course learning in the Beis Medrash we always remember that it ends in our natural state of love and affection toward each other. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/disunity.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7210" alt="disunity" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/disunity.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>“Put fire therein, and put incense upon them before the Lord tomorrow; and it shall be that the man whom the Lord does choose, he shall be holy; you take too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi.”</em> &#8211; Numbers 16:7</p>
<p>In this week’s parsha, Korach challenges the legitimacy of Moses’ leadership. It was something of a suicide mission as Korach knew that if he was wrong, he would die. But why would Korach risk his life? By all accounts Korach was smart and ambitious, not a fool. What was Korach thinking?</p>
<p>Rashi quotes the Medrash that says that the “you take too much upon yourselves” can be interpreted Midrashically to mean “I have told you about a great thing.” This explains Korach’s folly. Through prophecy, Korach saw a vision that he would have very special descendants and believed that he would be spared in their merit.</p>
<p>This vision emboldened Korach and he proceeded with his rebellion with confidence that he would survive the ordeal. It was Korach’s hubris that did him in. He thought that if his descendants were righteous it gave validity to his mission. In truth, his sons repented before the ground swallowed Korach and his rebels. It was their descendants who Korach saw in his prophecy.</p>
<p>Rabbeinu Chananel says that Korach and his group were Levites. R’ Shteinman points out that this means that the sin of this group was different than the other sins of the Israelites in the desert. Starting with the sin of the Golden Calf, the Levites abstained from sin. The Levites were able to withstand the temptation of sin throughout the sojourn in the desert. Until Korach.</p>
<p>What happened? Why was Korach the Levite susceptible to sin in this instance?<span id="more-7209"></span></p>
<p>R’ Shteinman directs us to a passage in Duties of the Heart to answer this question. A sinner who repents has an advantage over a righteous person who has never sinned. A pure person without sin can become overconfident in his or her ability not to sin. One who never sinned can become so arrogant about not sinning that it could lead one to sin. However, one who sinned and repented is always on the lookout so that one will not sin again. In this respect, the sinner who repented has a leg up on the one who has never sinned.</p>
<p>To illustrate: A righteous person said to a students “If you had never sinned I would be afraid of something worse than sin for your sake.” The students asked “What could be worse than sin?” The teacher replied “Arrogance.”</p>
<p>This explains how Korach could fall despite his Levite heritage. In fact, being a Levite contributed to his susceptibility to this particular sin. This sin was a sin of hubris. Korach thought that his prophetic vision of righteous descendants vindicated his cause. This is pure arrogance. The prophetic vision was ambiguous but Korach’s overconfidence walked him down the path of destruction.</p>
<p>It is true that the Levites resisted sin in the desert. But even they were not immune to the precipitous fall that begins with hubris.</p>
<p>There are two types of sins. One type of sin is a result of overwhelming passion or irreverent apathy. These are the sins we are most well equipped to avoid. We can withstand temptation or we can simply care. But sins that are caused by arrogance are a completely different brand of sin. These are sins that are so much harder to avoid because our arrogance blinds us to the sin and then it is too late.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes. We all fail sometimes. Many of our mistakes or failures are due to poor judgment or apathy. These mistakes are egregious but the problem is fixable. However when we make mistakes because we are arrogant or overconfident, we may not even see our mistakes until they are in our rear view mirror. We don’t even see it coming.</p>
<p>The only thing worse than sin is arrogance.</p>
<p>In our existing and potential relationships we must be so careful not to allow arrogance to blind us. We are at our worst when we feel superior to others. Arrogance makes us judgmental and pushes us to be divisive. We are at our best when we realize that we have so much to learn from everyone around us. Humility makes us see others favorably and pushes us toward unity.</p>
<p>Now we come full circle. Korach was arrogant. This caused him to rebel and create division. The antidote is humility. We will achieve unity when we are able to see the good in others and acknowledge that our differences make us a stronger unit than we would be if we were all the same. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4590176018_086a2de7ab_o.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7149" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4590176018_086a2de7ab_o-300x227.jpg" width="300" height="227" /></a>“And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.” &#8211; Number 14:1</em></p>
<p>Upon hearing the negative report of the spies about the Land of Canaan, the Israelites were forlorn. They believed they would have no chance of conquering the land and so they wept. The Talmud tells us in the name of Rabbi Yochanan that the night they wept was the 9th of Av. God told the Israelites that they cried for no reason on 9th of Av in the desert so God would give them a real reason to cry in the future. It seems that our first and second temples were destroyed on the 9th of Av as retribution for the communal sin of the spies and their slander.</p>
<p>The Book of Lamentations wails over the destruction of the first temple. According to the Talmud it also hints at the reasons for the destruction. Each of the first four chapters of the book forms an acrostic with the first letter of each sentence forming the Hebrew alphabet. In the Hebrew alphabet the letter Ayin precedes the letter Peh. However, the verse in Lamentations chapter 1 beginning with the letter Peh precedes the verse beginning with the letter Ayin. This is because the Peh, which can also refer to the mouth, jumped ahead of the Ayin, which can also refer to the eye. The spies spoke about things that their eyes did not see and so the Peh precedes the Ayin in Lamentations to allude to the sin that caused the destruction of the temple.</p>
<p>There is a problem with this interpretation.<span id="more-7148"></span> The problem is that it seems from the Talmud that the sin of the spies related to saying something with their mouths that they did not see. That’s a very normal way Lashon Hara, evil speech, is spread. But according to the text of the story, the spies merely reported what they actually did see. They saw a land that swallows its inhabitants. They saw giants. They even brought huge fruits as souvenirs. The spies editorialized a bit, yet we would never say that they spoke about what they did not see. How does this teaching of the Talmud fit in with the facts of the story from the text of the Book of Numbers?</p>
<p>Rabbi Shimon Schwab offers a beautiful explanation. R’ Schwab says that people see things the way that they alone see them. In other words, our personality, attitude, feelings, and experience color what our eyes see. Two people can look at the same thing and one can see spiritual beauty and the other can see physical beauty. Or two people can look at the same thing and one can see something ugly and the other can see something beautiful. It’s a matter of perspective and perception.</p>
<p>Take someone who knows nothing about the Jewish people or the history of Israel and show them the Kotel. That person will see rocks. Big rocks. And a wall. But take a person with an appreciation for its holiness and that person will see the grandeur of the Kotel as a place of worship and spirituality. It all depends on the person who is looking.</p>
<p>Similarly, the spies went to the Land of Canaan. They could have seen its inherent spiritual beauty. They could have seen the incredible opportunities for religious life and personal growth present in the land. But their eyes were not tuned into those things. The spies were only able to see the land with material vision. They could only appreciate the physical attributes of the land. They saw death and giants and large produce. They did not see the spiritual value of the land. The spies should have seen the Divine Presence on Mount Moriah. They should have felt the holiness of Hebron. But they did not. Why? Because they were using their eyes that were focused only on material things, not spiritual reality.</p>
<p>This explains why the Peh preceded the Ayin. The mouth spoke what the eyes did not see. The eyes should have seen a land of holiness and spirituality. The mouth spoke what it did not see. The mouth spoke of physical flaws and challenges. The spiritual eyes of the spies were closed and they did not see what they should have seen. This was the cause of their demise.</p>
<p>Every situation in our lives and in the public discourse has at least one way of looking at it. The way one sees something is influenced by their personality, experience, and feelings. Although we may be convinced our way is the correct way there is always another way to look at the same facts and draw different conclusions.</p>
<p>This is an important lesson in a global community. We live in a world where people with varied life experiences and environments, thus we are bound to see the same things through different lenses. Understanding that we can see the same things as another person and arrive at completely different conclusions is necessary in our modern world.</p>
<p>We must take the lesson of the spies and use the right glasses to see things the right way. But we also must understand that when others see things differently than we do, often it is because they are different people with a different pair of glasses. Knowing this, we can take steps to further our understanding and appreciation of others and their ideas bringing us closer to a day of peace among all inhabitants of the earth. Good Shabbos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6803" alt="Ravschwab1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Ravschwab1-193x300.png" width="193" height="300" />With all the excitement about R&#8217; Hershel Schachter&#8217;s comments last week, some discussion about the role of the lay people as critics of the rabbinic leadership has ensued. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, R&#8217; Shimon Schwab in Parshas Vayikra has an interesting, and particularly relevant thought on Torah leaders being criticized by their followers.</p>
<p>The verse says (JPS) <em>&#8220;When a ruler sinneth, and doeth through error any one of all the things which the LORD his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty: if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without blemish.&#8221; (Leviticus 4:22-23)</em></p>
<p>Rashi comments on the choice of language in the verse. The verse says &#8220;אִשֶׁר&#8221; - &#8221;when a ruler sinneth&#8221; and we would expect it to say &#8220;if a ruler sinneth&#8221; like it says previously with regard to the sin of a High Priest. Why? Rashi quotes the Toras Kohanim and says that the word is אִשֶׁר because it is reminiscent of the word אַשְׁרֵי &#8211; &#8220;fortunate.&#8221; Thus, &#8220;Fortunate is the generation whose leader [does not hold himself too high, but rather,] gives attention to bringing an atonement offering for his unintentional sins-and how much more will he experience remorse for the sins he has committed willfully!&#8221; (Translation of Rashi via Judaica Press).<span id="more-6802"></span></p>
<p>Rav Schwab quotes the Talmud in Chagiga 14A, <em>(translation via Soncino).</em> <em>&#8220;When R. Dimi came, he said: Eighteen curses did Isaiah pronounce upon Israel, yet he was not pacified until he pronounced upon them this verse: The child shall behave insolently against the aged, and the base against the honorable.&#8221; </em>The Talmud explains the verse: <em>Those persons who are empty of good deeds shall behave insolently against such as are filled with good deeds as a pomegranate with seeds. &#8216;And the base against the honorable&#8217;: to those to whom weighty [precepts] appear as light ones will come and behave insolently against those to whom light [precepts] appear as weighty ones.</em></p>
<p>In other words, Isaiah cursed the Jewish people with 18 curses. But that didn&#8217;t placate him. The only thing that calmed him down was this final idea, really two curses, that things would be so bad that the leaders would be severely criticized by people completely unworthy of making that criticism.</p>
<p>Rav Schwab asks, did Isaiah hate his fellow Jews? Eighteen curses weren&#8217;t enough? He needed two more? Isaiah needed to add insult to injury? And what about these last two curses made him feel better anyway?</p>
<p>Rav Schwab explains, that Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy here was that there would be a time where the unworthy, younger generation will have complaints against their elders and they will come to the carriers of Torah and lodge their complaints, and even the complainers will severely lacking in Mitzvos, still the criticisms will be lodged against the Torah leaders of the generation and raise their voice loudly when revealing a flaw in the acts of those leaders.</p>
<p>This is what comforted Isaiah. Even thought the situation will be disastrous following 18 curses the Torah leaders will be forced to be deliberate in their actions so that their mistakes will not be disclosed by the lesser worthy people who are lacking in righteousness. Isaiah can take comfort in this. The leaders may err, but there will always be followers to speak up when that happens.</p>
<p>The Talmud in Rosh Hashana (25B) similarly states &#8220;Praiseworthy is the generation where the great ones listen to the lesser ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what Rashi was referencing. A generation is fortunate when its leaders are able to recognize that they are mistaken. This comes from their followers who despite their sins and weaknesses criticize their leaders when necessary.</p>
<p>Seems appropriate considering the state of affairs in orthodox Judaism in general and in particular how our leadership is dealing with sexual abuse. Sometimes our leaders need the people beneath them to criticize them. Isaiah felt like that was a good thing according to Rav Schwab. I humbly agree.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</address>
<h2>Parshas Vayechi<br />
Golus Gold is Fool&#8217;s Gold</h2>
<p>Each year at this time we read of Bnai Yisrael’s impending golus. Each event from the sale of Yosef into Mitzrayim until Yaakov Avinu’s arrival and subsequent death in Egypt is a pattern of history which we have, sadly, followed all too often. One interesting attitude regarding <i>golus</i> and all of its impact is thrice repeated by Chazal and found in Parshas Vayigash, Vayechi, as well as, in Sefer Shmos. Its implicit message is profound</p>
<p>Following Yaakov Avinu’s <i>petirah</i> Yosef tells Pharaoh that he must bury his father (Yaakov) in Eretz Yisrael. Indeed, Yosef explains to the Egyptian monarch, that his father, Yaakov, made him swear (50:5) that he would bury him (Yaakov) in the grave “<em>asher karisi li b’Eretz Canaan</em>.” Chazal are puzzled by this unusual term of “<em>karisi li</em>” and offer many explanations as to its meaning. Amongst a number of <i>pshatim</i>, Rashi quotes one <i>man d’amar</i> which explains that Yaakov informed Yosef that he had purchased the right to be buried in <em>Me’aras Hamachpaila</em> from his brother Eisav. Sometime after his return to Eretz Yisrael, Yaakov took all the money he earned in the house of Lavan and gave it to Eisav as payment. Yaakov wanted to be sure there would be no argument after his death regarding the rights to this coveted burial plot. He paid for it just to be sure.</p>
<p>However there is an important detail in these words of Chazal which cannot be overlooked.<span id="more-6718"></span> The Midrash says that the money he used to purchase his burial plot came form the assets he accumulated while working in Lavan’s home. In parshas Vayigash, this Midrash is at the heart of a vital <i>yesod</i> taught to us in Rashi. The posuk (46:6) states <i>vayikchu es mikneihem v’es richusham asher rachashi b’eretz Canaan vayavoa Mitzrayma</i>. Rashi wonders what are we to learn from the fact that the <i>posuk</i> specifically states that Yaakov and his sons took they assets they acquired in Eretz Canaan with them to Egypt. On the spot, Rashi quotes the aforementioned Midrash and adds a twist. He says that Yaakov Avinu declared “<i>nichasei chutz laAretz einan kidai li</i>!” The assets I amassed in <i>golus</i> are inappropriate for me. Only the monies I acquired while in Eretz Yisrael have real value! As such, Yaakov gave all the money he earned in the house of Lavan to Eisav in order to guarantee the right of burial in <i>Me’aras Hamachpeilah</i>. Only the assets earned in Eretz Yisrael were brought down with his family to Mitzrayim.</p>
<p>This message cannot be overlooked. Yaakov Avinu, the one who risked his life in Parshas Vayishlach for <i>pachim ktanim</i> – small jars, wanted to take nothing from the Golus with him. Better to give it away. Indeed, only the assets of Eretz Yisrael, our true home, our spiritual <i>makkor</i>, should accompany us in the sojourn of exile. The resources and material acquired <i>chutz laAretz</i> are temporary at best and they are tainted with <i>golus</i> fever which can infect our value system at anytime.</p>
<p><i>Maasei avos siman labanim. </i>This attitude towards golus-gold is eternal. Material wealth amassed in the Diaspora is ephemeral and we must view it that way. To do otherwise places us at risk of becoming a prisoner to its lustful attraction. Real money and real value is that which we accomplish in Eretz Yisrael. Chazal are guiding us to understand that Yaakov Avinu wanted us to learn a lesson before heading down to Mitzrayim.  Golus-gold is fools gold, it may acquire things, even good things such as a burial plot in <i>mearas hamachpeila</i>, but ultimately it has no intrinsic value. We cannot take it with us nor should we. We who are so desperate for <i>geula</i> must make this attitude real. It must pulsate through all of our <i>golus</i> endeavors. Indeed, internalizing this mantra is the first ingredient in being able to proudly answer the question of <i>tzipisem</i> <i>liyishua</i> correctly.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Learn With Your Children</h2>
<p>After Yosef reveals himself to his brothers he sends them home to tell their father that he is still alive and to please come join him in Mitzrayim. The brothers hasten to their father and exclaim <i>od Yosef chai vchi hu mosheil b’chol Eretz Mitzrayim </i>- Yosef still lives and he is the ruler over all of Egypt. The Torah continues, <i>vayafag libo ki lo he&#8217;emin lahem </i>- Yakov&#8217;s heart fluttered because he did not believe them. However, when the brothers continued to tell their story, and Yakov saw the <i>agalos &#8211; </i>the wagons that Yosef sent to carry him down to Egypt the Pasuk tells us: <i>vat’chi ruach Yaakov Avihem </i>– Yaakov’s spirit was revived and invigorated. He was so much <i>b’simcha</i> that he was even ready for <i>nevuah</i>.</p>
<p>One cannot help but wonder, why didn’t Yaakov believe the <em>Shevatim</em> from the moment they reported the momentous news of Yosef’s survival? And why did the <i>agalos</i> revive Yaakov’s spirit?<span id="more-6659"></span> Lev Eliyahu explains that Yakov Avinu, upon hearing the declaration of his 11 sons – including Binyamin, had no doubt that Yosef was physically alive. What he could not believe was that <i>od Yosef </i><b><i>Chai</i></b>- that the spiritual essence of Yosef <b><i>Hatzadik</i></b> had survived after so many years away from his father and his family. Could the leader of Egypt be a frum Jew? Couldn’t be, thought Yaakov Avinu. After all, one cannot ascend to such a powerful position without a compromise of religious values and practice. Though he was happy to hear the news that Yosef was still physically alive, <i>vayafeg libo</i> Yaakov’s felt faint. He now feared not the loss of Yosef but of Yosef <i>Hatzadik!</i> His soul shuddered at the thought that his righteous son had been corrupted by the depravity of Egyptian society. The brothers tried to convince Yakov otherwise, but Yakov would not accept it. To Yakov it was impossible—until he saw the wagons that Yosef sent for him.</p>
<p>Chazal tell us that Yosef sent <i>Agalos</i> to hint to his father of the topic they had been studying 22 years earlier, the laws of <i>Egla Arufa</i>. Yosef anticipated his father&#8217;s concern and knew that if he could demonstrate to his father that he was still immersed in Torah, his father wouldn&#8217;t be disappointed, nor would he suspect that Yosef had <i>chas v’shalom</i> deviated from the Torah&#8217;s way. Indeed, as a result, <i>vat’chi ruach Yaakov Avihem</i>. Yaakov’s spirit was rejuvinated.</p>
<p>We learn from this a powerful message of how one should never underestimate nor diminish the importance of parents and children learning together. Even after twenty-two years it was the bond of Talmud Torah between father and son that gave life meaning to both Yakov and Yosef. It is a bond that lasts forever and it is never too late to start!</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayishlach<br />
An Important Parenting Tip From Yaakov</h2>
<p>Yaakov Avinu’s dreaded  encounter with <em>Eisav harasha</em> concludes happily with Eisav’s invitation for Yaakov to accompany him. Yaakov declines, explaining that his children are young and he is overladen with sheep and cattle. Yaakov, therefore, urges Eisav to set forth without him and proclaims “<em>va’ani esnahal l’iti liregel hamilacha asher lifanai uli’regel hayiladim </em>— I (Yaakov) will travel at my <em>own</em> pace congruent with the task at hand and the ability of the children.” <em>Chazal</em> derive many important lessons from the entire Yaakov/Eisav encounter. One particular insight is gleaned from the above response of Yaakov Avinu to his brother Eisav which provides us a critical perspective into <em>Chinuch Habanim</em>.</p>
<p>Parents have dreams for their children. Often, we set up expectations based upon our own personal goals and agendas. Sometimes, we push our youngsters hard towards these goals. Other times, we assert a <em>laissez faire</em> attitude toward their responsibilities. In general, we want them to like what we like and think how we think. We may even live vicariously through a particular child. All of the above can be a formula for disaster.</p>
<p><span id="more-6553"></span>Yaakov Avinu teaches us that in order to arrive “<em>shalem</em>”–with our family spiritually whole and intact, we must set the ambitions for <em>each</em> of our<em> kinderlach</em> “<em>l’regel hayiladim</em>” &#8211; at the pace of the children. Indeed, in setting goals for the spiritual, personal and academic growth of each child, we must consider his or her strengths, weaknesses, tendencies and character traits. One mold just won’t do it. To the contrary, we must tailor the nurturing of our children to their individual abilities and guide them toward being <em>Ovdei Hashem </em>with the G-d given talents they have been blessed with.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the<em> posuk</em> concludes with Yaakov Avinu telling Eisav that he (Yaakov) will keep pace with the children “<em>ad</em> <em>asher yavo el adoni s’eirah.</em>” Rashi notes that Yaakov Avinu never intended to journey to <em>Eisav’s</em> home, rather he was speaking of the future, the <em>yimos Hamashiach</em> of which it says, <em>v’alu moshiim b’Har Tzion lishpot es Har Eisav</em>. Clearly the unspoken message is that our ability to individualize our <em>chinuch habanim</em> is a significant, if not the requisite, force in bringing about the arrival of the ultimate redemption. An era of <em>shleimos</em> can only be delivered by our developing the <em>sheleimos</em> of each child in our care. Indeed, <em>Hashem Yisborach</em> has placed a unique<em> neshama</em> in each of us. Developing the individual potential of each child entrusted to us is our greatest responsibility and its potential affords us the greatest <em>nachas</em> of all.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayetze<br />
The Ropes That Pull Us Together</h2>
<p>As we begin to see the emergence of Yaakov Avinu as the father of the <em>shivtei ka </em>we cannot help but notice the many nuanced messages and symbolism the Torah shares with us. One such <em>yesod</em> is found in the encounter of Yitzchok Avinu at the famous well outside of Charan.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that Yaakov Avinu arrived at Charan after his harrowing journey in flight from his brother. As he arrived he finds himself at the <em>be’er basadeh</em>. There the famous tale of his encounter with Rochel Imeinu is recorded. Chazal wonder what is to be learned from the fact that it is a <em>be’er basadeh</em>, a well in the field, which defines Yaakov Avinu’s arrival into <em>golus</em>.</p>
<p>Midrashim are filled with symbolic messages explaining the representations of this <em>be’er</em>, the <em>edrei tzon</em> and the large stone which sealed and provided access to the water source of the community. The Malbim provides us a most meaningful <em>mehalach </em>so relevant to us today.<span id="more-6505"></span></p>
<p>In his approach the Malbim explains that the<em> be’er </em>represents the <em>mekor mayim chayim</em>. It reflects the<em> hashpaas</em> Hashem, His goodness and bountiful blessings that give us the proverbial hug from the Borei Olam. In a word, the Be’er represents the Shechina and how it fills our lives with all of His blessings. The symbolism is powerful.</p>
<p>The Malbim points out that as Yaakov was now in <em>golus</em> the Shechina came with him, indeed the <em>be’er</em> was <em>basadeh</em>, in the field outside of Eretz Yisrael. However, when Klal Yisrael is living in their homeland with the close access to the Shechina the Bais Hamikdash provides we will find the <em>be’er bisoch ha’er</em>, in the very heart of the city. Nevertheless, while residing in <em>golus </em>it is our vital task to bring that <em>be’er</em> and the spiritual nourishment it represents from the <em>sadeh</em> into our home.</p>
<p>Just how does one bring the sanctity and warmth of the <em>be’er</em> into their home? The Malbim again draws on the words of Chazal and teaches that Reb Yehoshua taught his students that the way to harness the power of the <em>be’er</em> and pull it from the <em>sadeh</em> into the city is by fashioning <em>chavalim min hasubim</em> and through that be <em>machzeer Shechinaso leTziyon</em>. Strands braided from the leftover and unwanted fibers can be spun and twisted into powerful ropes, attached to the well and used to <em>shlep</em> it into the heart of the city. The ropes the Malbim describes represent the spinning and twisting together of Klal Yisrael from many fragments (even discarded ones) into one cord of strength as Yidden from all walks of life come together to accomplish the seemingly impossible.</p>
<p>The message is clear. If we want to bring the Shechina into our city, our community and our home we need strong ropes of <em>achdus</em> to pull together and bring the <em>be’er </em>closer and provide us the spiritual refreshment the <em>hashpaas haShechina </em>bestows. Only through <em>achdus</em> can we truly fare well.</p>
<p>This is no small feat.</p>
<p>Too often we stand apart rather then building on what we have in common. However, we must find a way to wrap ourselves around our common heartfelt <em>emuna</em> and the inner goodness of each Jew to braid a cord of unity and strength with which to connect to the Shechina and bring it home. This, Chazal teach us, is the formula for extricating ourselves from the morass of <em>golus</em>. It is not enough to seek spirituality. We must pull it inward. We cannot do it ourselves &#8211; we need every fiber of Jewry to pull together as one strong cord of strength. By doing so we can hope to fill our lives with His love and bring the <em>be’er </em>into our homes and thereby bring our homes to the ultimate <em>mikor</em> of <em>kedusha</em> in Yerushalayim Ir Hakodesh<br />
<em>bimheira biyameinu</em>.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Toldos<br />
The Man Makes the Clothes</h2>
<p>As Yaakov Avinu dons the <em>bigdei chamudos </em>of Eisav Harasha the impersonation of his brother is complete. He places goat skins on his neck and hands and enters the chamber of Yitzchok Avinu with the delicacies prepared by his mother. Something else accompanies him, too. As Yitzchok verifies Yaakov’s identity, he tenders a fatherly kiss, and notices a fragrant aroma streaming forth from Yaakov’s wardrobe and gives him a bracha. As he does so, Yitzchok exclaims; <em>“re’eh reiach b’nee kreiach hasadeh asher beracho Hashem</em>.” Chazal explain this to mean that the aroma of Gan Eden emanated from the very clothing Yaakov put on to visit his father.</p>
<p>One cannot help but wonder, why now? What was so unusual?  After all, the <em>bigdei chamudos </em>that Yaakov was wearing were the very same special clothes that Eisav himself wore when he went to serve his father. Didn’t the aroma of Gan Eden accompany them when Eisav wore them, too? Apparently not. Indeed, it is the man that makes the clothes and not vice versa.<span id="more-6477"></span></p>
<p>Chazal teach that Eisav’s <em>bigdei chamudos </em>was really the special cloak that Eisav took from Nimrod. This garment has a long history. It was the same outfit that Hashem Yisborach <em>kivayachol </em>fashioned for Adam and Chava, the k<em>osnos ohr</em>, He used to clothe them after He evicted them from Gan Eden. But if these clothes were given to Adam and Chava after their being thrown out of Gan Eden how do they carry its aroma?</p>
<p>The answer is found in our understanding of that first cloak. Though the posuk spells the word ohr with the letter ayin, meaning leather, the Midrash says, that in the Torah of  Rabbi Meir, the word ohr was written with an alef, meaning light. How are we to understand this Chazal?</p>
<p>Life in Gan Eden before the sin of Adam and Chava was supernatural. Wheat stalks grew from kernels into the finest cakes, right out of the ground! There was no need to further refine its nature. Its spiritual potential and physical essence were the perfect harmonious blend that Hashem Yisborach intended. All that changed after the <em>cheit</em> of Adam Harishon. No longer would the world produce a naturally finished product. Though man could no longer enjoy the instant Kedusha which surrounded him in Gan Eden, all was not lost. Hashem still gave us the opportunity of sanctifying this world. But now we would have to do it on our own. Hashem in his infinite kindness enabled us to recreate the essential Gan Eden experience. With hard work we are able to spiritualize the world gifted to us. We can imbue all we touch with ruchniyus. We can transform the <em>olam hagashmi,</em> symbolized by leather, (<em>ohr</em> with an <em>ayin</em>) into light &#8211; a spiritual luminescence – the <em>ohr</em> with an alef! In so doing we recreate the essence of Gan Eden in our lives today. This is the message of Rabbi Meir.</p>
<p>Indeed, this essence of Gan Eden was mastered by Yaakov Avinu, the <em>ish tam yosheiv ohalim</em>. He with his <em>middah</em> of <em>emes</em> was able to impart all the qualities of His <em>ruchniyus </em>and transform whatever <em>gashmiyus </em>came his way into a <em>cheftza shel kedusha</em>, mastering and harnessing its total spiritual potential. This is the <em>koach</em> that enables Yaakov to produce the 12 <em>shevatim</em>. Approaching Yitzchok Avinu with the <em>mitzvah</em> maximized to its fullest potential, the aroma of Gan Eden was now with him as well. No wonder that Eisav Harasha could never produce that fragrant scent while he wore those clothes. Only a Yaakov Avinu could bring out their <em>kedusha</em> to the fullest. We, his children have that same potential. We can bring the essence of Eden to the world each day. It is our ultimate <em>tachlis</em> and makes Hashem so very proud of all that we, His children, can achieve.</p>

<h2>Parshas Chayei Sarah<br />
Sweating the Small Stuff</h2>
<p><em>Parshas</em> Chaya Sarah commences with Avraham <em>Avinu</em> preparing for the funeral of his lifelong partner, his beloved wife, our matriarch Sarah <em>Imeinu.</em> Interestingly, the Midrash specifically lauds Avraham as the quintessential man of <em>chessed</em> as a result of his taking care of the funeral plans for his deceased wife, Sarah. This seems puzzling and the <em>mefarshim</em> wonder why is it that the act of the burial of Sarah is made into such a big deal. After all, that is what Avraham or anyone would do. It is normative typical behavior.</p>
<p>Why would such normal conduct be the defining moment in crowning Avraham as the <em>ish shel chessed</em> for which he is known and the man of <em>chessed</em> who we wish strive to emulate?<span id="more-6447"></span></p>
<p>The answer to this query provides us a phenomenal insight into the true definition of <em>chessed</em> that is so important for us to a remember. Simply put, <em>chessed</em> begins at home. but more importantly, <em>chessed</em> is primarily about attitude.</p>
<p>Indeed, being a <em>baal chessed</em> is not defined by the big things which generate headlines, rather, true <em>chessed</em> is found in taking care of the little things, considerately. The act of burying Sarah wasn’t what defined Avraham’s greatness as a <em>baal chessed,</em> rather, it was how he went about the internment of his beloved wife that established his greatness in <em>chessed.</em></p>
<p>The message is profound. Each day is filled with a plethora of chessed opportunities starting from the very moment we wake up. We must attempt to emulate Avraham <em>Avinu</em> in each of the little things in life that seem to be routine or mundane. <em>Chessed</em> is found at the breakfast table, in our morning greetings in how we handle the expected and the seemingly trivial moments of life. Indeed, <em>chessed</em> is defined in how we do the little things. Saying good morning with a smile, making others feel important, being cheerful and kind in our personal relationships can all be acts of <em>chessed,</em> if we do them with care.</p>
<p>Being kind when it is not meant to be noticed and going the extra mile with attention to detail and having sensitivity for the feelings of others in our day to day lives enables us to live the legacy of Avraham Avinu each day.</p>

Many people were very extremely emotionally invested in the outcome of the vote.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s greatest supporters wiped tears of joy from their eyes as the president addressed the nation in his victory speech. Mitt Romney&#8217;s greatest supporters were also drying their tears as they were informed of the results (captured in spectacular modern form on this Tumblr: <a href="http://whitepeoplemourningromney.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Whitepeoplemourningromney</a>).</p>
<p>In the old days, when your candidate lost, you grumbled at home, maybe made some comments around the water cooler at work, or maybe even penned an Op-Ed. But in 2012, when your candidate loses, the opportunities to publicly grieve are so much greater. Conservatives (and liberals would have done the same thing if Romney had won) took to social media expressing their distaste for the election results.</p>
<p>This means three things.<span id="more-6440"></span></p>
<p>First, it means that people have an opportunity to vent, be heard, and create a conversation about the election in a public place. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>Second, it means that people can make one another hysterical with exaggerations, myths, or pure fabrications. Since anyone can write anything they want, misinformation can spread rather easily. Especially, when people are in a state of grief, they are particularly susceptible to hyperbole and over-dramatics.</p>
<p>Third, it means that people in a compromised state can say or do things that they will regret. But they are doing them publicly. This can make things awkward when they cool off.</p>
<p>I think that we need a little bit of advice on dealing with disappointment and grief. Fortunately, this week&#8217;s parsha is Chayei Sarah &#8211; the parsha where we learn about grief. Granted, Avraham was grieving for his beloved wife, but I am pretty sure some people loved Romney more than they loved their spouses, or at the very least, hate Obama enough to make it an apt comparison.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that Sarah died and Avraham came to eulogize her and to cry for her. The next verse says that <em>&#8220;Avraham rose up from the presence of his deceased.</em>&#8221; (Genesis 23:3) Then Avraham went to negotiate a burial place for Sarah. The commentaries are bothered by the strange usage in verse 3. Why does the Torah say that Avraham &#8220;rose up&#8221;?</p>
<p>I once heard from Reb Yeruchem Levovitz that the Torah is telling us an important lesson in grief. So long as Avraham was grieving for his wife in private, it was acceptable, even laudable,  for his emotions to be on his sleeve. But once he began dealing with outsiders in a potential business deal, Avraham had to leave those public emotions behind. Avraham had to &#8220;rise up&#8221; from his mood of public grief and put on his game face so that he could deal with the realities of life. Outward displays of grief have a way of weighing on others and making interactions uncomfortable for other people.</p>
<p>Avraham was in complete control of his emotions and when it was time to face the world, he kept his emotions in check.</p>
<p>I think this is great advice for mourning conservatives. I empathize with people who feel terrible about the election. But I do not empathize with YouTube screeds, public plans to move to Australia, fear mongering, sore loser complaints, or any other anti-social reaction to the election. I think we all have a responsibility to act civilly toward each other whether we win or we lose, whether we are elated or depressed.</p>
<p>To be fair, I think this applies equally to public displays of schadenfreude. But I have seen far less of that than I have seen meltdowns.</p>
<p>My last piece of advice is not to become too emotionally invested in things that are out of one&#8217;s control. Politics and sports are two areas where people place a tremendous amount of emotional energy. We are setting ourselves up for disappointment if we expect to win every time. We won&#8217;t. Reasonable people will disagree. Your political opponents are not (all) idiots. There&#8217;s enough room for an amalgamation of conservative and liberal views in our political system.</p>
<p>I chuckled at liberals who mourned in 2004 when Bush won his second term and I chuckle today when conservatives proclaim Obama&#8217;s reelection the end of America.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s learn the lesson of Avraham&#8217;s mourning. Pull yourself together and carry on with making a difference in the world.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayera<br />
Place Your Faith in God</h2>
<p>The <em>posuk</em> says that as Avraham Avinu neared <em>Har Homoria</em> on the way to the <em>Akeida</em> he lifted his eyes,  “<em>Vayar Es Hamakom Meirachok”</em>— and he saw the place from afar. Typically this is translated as meaning that Avraham saw the mountain, <em>Har Hamoriah</em>, and what is now <em>Har Habyis</em>, from a distance. However, the <em>Sfas Emes</em> has a novel insight on the <em>Posuk</em> which carries a meaningful message for us all.<span id="more-6408"></span></p>
<p>The <em>Sfas Emes</em> powerfully explains that at a deeper level the word <em>&#8220;Makom&#8221;</em> in the <em>posuk</em> does not refer to the mountain-site destination of the <em>Akeida.</em> Rather, he says, it refers to <em>Hashem Yisborach</em> Himself. <em>“Hamakom”</em> (literally “the Place”) is one of the many names and manifestations <em>Kivayachol,</em> of the <em>Ribbono Shel Olam,</em> who is everywhere. Says the <em>Sfas Emes</em> — on the way to the <em>Akeida,</em> Avraham was at times filled with dread, fear and even doubt. He looked up and lifted his eyes to heaven for some clarity, <em>&#8220;Vayar es Hamakom Meirachok&#8221;</em> and felt his comprehension of the <em>derech</em> and <em>ratzon</em> Hashem to be very far away &#8211; very far indeed. How could he be asked to sacrifice his beloved son Yitzchok?</p>
<p>Is that really what a loving G-d would want? Nevertheless, Avraham Avinu went forward. He persevered. He alighted the mountain and scaled the highest peak of <em>Emunah</em> and <em>Bitachon.</em> Hakadosh Baruch Hu responded to Avraham’s <em>mesiras nefesh</em> and told him, “<em>V&#8217;ata Yadati Ki Yirei Elokim Ata</em>”—Now I know that you, Avraham, have a true fear of heaven. Yes, despite his reservations, lack of understanding and even doubt Avraham Avinu put Hashem&#8217;s desire first.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t we?</p>
<p>This dedication to the <em>Melech Malchei Hamilachaim</em> is a major part of Avraham’s legacy to us! It empowers us with the devotion to stand by our <em>Emunah</em> even when times are tough, when we don&#8217;t understand and when we feel lost and confused. Total <em>Bitachon</em> it is the ultimate formula for achieving the grandeur of <em>Gadlus Ha&#8217;adam</em> gifted to us by Avraham Avinu and for us to model to our children each and every day.</p>

<h2>Parshas Lech Lecha<br />
Giving is Pure</h2>
<p>As the final step in his transformation from Avram into Avraham Avinu he and Bnai Yisrael are gifted the Mitzvah of Bris Milah for eternity. Interestingly this mitzvah is introduced with a fascinating phrase which provides us an amazing insight in to Avraham Avinus inspiring personality and a valuable lesson for us all. Let us explore further.</p>
<p>Hashem tells Avram, “<em>hishaeich lifanay v’heyei tamim</em>” &#8211; Walk before me and be pure. He then proceeds to change Avram’s name to Avraham, promise him Eretz Ysrael and conform his eternal covenant with his offspring, the Jewish people, in the <em>zechus</em> of Avraham and his children performing Bris Milah. How are we to understood this command of being <em>tamim </em>which eventually spawns the requirement of <em>tamim tehiyeh im Hashem Elokecha </em>Moshe demands of us in <em>sefer</em> Devarim?</p>
<p>The Midrash Tanchuma describes Avraham’s reaction to this statement and teaches that when  Avraham heard Hashem tell him <em>hishaeich lifanay v’heyei tamim </em>and was told to perform Bris Milah he was confused. Indeed, he was shaken up.<span id="more-6380"></span> Avraham, the Tanchuma says, said to himself, “how could it be that I have yet to become pure? I have totally dedicated myself to the Ribbono Shel Olam until now. What is left for me to do?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Avraham wondered, in the words of the Midrash, by performing a circumcision &#8220;I will be removing and damaging a part of my body, thereby causing an imperfection on myself.” How does that make me complete and pure?</p>
<p>Hashem guided Avraham through this conundrum and explained to him that what you think is whole, is really not yet perfect. Perfection of character and soul is not simply about taking care of what you have, it is about what one is willing to sacrifice and is willing to give. Giving up something for the Ribbono Shel Olam doesn&#8217;t diminish what you have, it actually improves who you are!</p>
<p>Indeed, to be a <em>tamim</em> one has to give. It is in the giving that we ascend the ladder of virtue and it is in  the giving we truly become complete.</p>
<p>This message must never be lost upon us. What defines us is not what we have but what we are willing to give. Time, money and love are just a few examples. But the more we give the more we have. And, the more we give the more we reinforce that covenant with Hashem Yisborach which assures our destiny as His Am Segulah and an <em>ohr la’amim </em>for all to see.</p>

<h2>Parshas Noach<br />
Old Fashioned Values</h2>
<p>This week we read of the great flood. The famed <em>mabul</em> erased all living things from the face of the earth except for Noach his children and the animals Hashem told him to put in the <em>teiva</em>. In describing the iniquities of humankind and the state of the world that led to the eradication of life outside of the <em>teiva,</em> the Torah tells us, <em>“vatishacheis haaretz lifnei haElokim—</em>the world was corrupted before Hashem.<em>”</em> In analyzing this <em>posuk. </em>the <em>meforshim</em> primarilay explore the types of <em>aveiros</em> which had been committed by society at large which caused their total decay. Indeed, they teach that the type of corruption that filled the land was the outgrowth of those sins which were <em>lifnei</em> Elokim, <em>gilui arayous</em>, <em>avoda zara</em> and <em>shfichas</em> <em>damim</em>—immorality, idolatry and murder. The world had become morally bankrupt with no moral discipline, G-dly aspirations or respect for the sanctity of life. As such, it was a world without a future and had to be destroyed and started over anew.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this verse, seems to have some superfluous wording. We were already told at the end of parshas Bereishis that Hashem saw <em>ki rabbas rah hadam baaretz —  </em>the world had turned evil. And, the very next posuk in parshas Noach tells us again, <em>vayar Elokim es haaretz v’henei nishchosa</em>. Our possuk, if needed at all, could just have said <em>vatishacheis haaretz—</em>the world was corrupt. What do we learn from being told that the corruption was <em>lifnei</em> haElokim— before the Ribbono Shel Olam?<span id="more-6353"></span></p>
<p>To answer this question we must examine more closely the essence of human nature and its collective impact on society at large? Indeed, a powerful lesson is being taught.</p>
<p>As society spiraled into its decadent ways the mores and norms of daily life changed. What was at one time forbidden became accepted. Steadily the value system deteriorated and that which was socially and morally repugnant just a few years earlier became the new standard of accepted behavior. So far had the <em>dor hamabul </em>strayed that they no longer even recognized right from wrong, they reversed them! In fact, those that tried holding onto the healthy values of the past were ridiculed as old fashioned, out of touch and ancient relics of days gone by. Indeed, society so strongly embraced its new behavior that it redefined the <em>pre-diluvian </em>normal. Ultimately, it was so bad that only Hashem could recall what should have been. It was only <em>lifnei HaElokim, </em>before G-d, that the world was corrupted — everyone else thought it was normal! What a powerful message.</p>
<p>History tends to repeat itself. The lessons of Noach and the <em>mabul</em> are as relevant as ever. Everyday we learn of something new. Ethics and values of yesteryear are relegated to the trash heap of history. Societies continue to produce new “normals” and reconstituted modern morals all the time. Yet, we must ask ourselves, are these new standards in consonance with what the Torah expects of us? Are we to embrace the new or hold onto the past? IS the new normal really normal?</p>
<p>We must learn from the <em>parsha</em> that the relative good of what is new and what is right and wrong cannot be left to human kind (or Madison Avenue) to define. We need a compass to assure that we are staying the course and headed in the right direction. We need a scale to properly weigh the conflicting messages which assault our <em>neshama</em> and character each day. Fortunately, Hakadosh Baruch Hu gifted us the Torah help us do just that. We must study it well and apply its message in our every endeavor.  It is the anchor to assure that our human drives match the standards and ambitions the Ribbono Shel Olam has for us all.</p>

<h2>Parshas Breishis<br />
Light It Up</h2>
<p>Parshas B’reishis, the story of creation is filled with <em>yesodos</em> and insights for life and <em>emunah</em>. One amazing lesson is gleaned from the defining saga of Adam and Chava and their expulsion from Gan Eden. Let us explore further.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that as Hashem Yisborach ejected Adam and Chava from Gan Eden, “<em>vayaas Hashem Elokim l’Adam ulishto konos ohr vayalbisheim</em>” — “Hashem Yisborach fashioned leather garments for Adam and Chava and He clothed them.”<span id="more-6311"></span></p>
<p>From here Chazal teach us of Hashem’s kindness and beneficence. Although He had to punish them for what they had done by expelling them from the utopia of the Gan, He still took care of them. He clothed them and loved them. That in itself is a phenomenal message and should inspire us to feel appreciation to Hashem for all He does for us. However, an enigmatic Midrash tells us of an even bigger idea.</p>
<p>Chazal teach “<em>raeesi b’Toraso shel Rabbi Meir lo ksiv  </em>עור<em> elah </em>אור<em> </em> &#8211; the word “ohr” in Rabbi Meir’s Torah was written with the letter Alef meaning light and NOT with an Ayin, meaning skin (leather) as it is in our Chumashim.</p>
<p>How are we to understand this <em>aggadah</em>. Did Rabbi Meir have a different Chumash than we do? What is the message to us?</p>
<p>Our <em>chachamim</em> explain the lesson in a most profound manner. While in Gan Eden Adam and Chava were surrounded with <em>kedusha</em>. Everything was there for them spiritually and physically. Now leaving that utopian environment they could not survive if bereft of <em>kedusha</em> so they would have to create there own! They were challenged and charged with the mission of transforming the physical world into a spiritual one, to create holiness form the, seemingly mundane. They were to  transform the <em>ohr</em> with an Ayin, the physical world, into the <em>ohr</em> with an Alef, the spiritual.</p>
<p>This is our destiny and our responsibility. We can and must transform everything we do from <em>gashmiyus</em> into <em>ruchniyus</em>. When we do that we are providing the world the <em>nitzotzos</em> of <em>kedusha</em> it needs to survive. And, we are creating the אור which is reserved for<em> asid lavo</em> which will, <em>b’karov</em> at the end of days, shine on us all.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayelech<br />
That’s Our Song</h2>
<p>The last of the <em>Taryag</em> (613) Mitzvos of the Torah is found in this week’s Parsha. It is the requirement that each Jew write a Sefer Torah. There are many ways to fulfill this Mitzvah. One can commission the writing of a new Sefer Torah, purchase a “used” Torah, write in a single letter of a newly written scroll, or, according to some authorities, the Mitzvah can be carried out by purchasing Seforim of any sort.</p>
<p>It is easily understood why this obligation is the Torah’s final demand of us all. What is not so clear is why the Torah describes this Mitzvah by saying <em>kisvu lachem es hashira hazos</em>, write for yourselves this song &#8211; comparing the Torah <em>Hakedosha</em> to a melody.</p>
<p>One insight from the “Shearis Menachem” explains that a primary lesson of last week’s Parsha, Nitzavim, was the <em>Bris</em> of <em>Arvus</em> — that <em>kol Yisrael areivim zeh lazeh</em> &#8211; all Jews are interdependent. The Mitzvah of <em>Ksivas Sefer Torah</em> and the expectation that it be studied and taught from generation to generation embodies that same flavor. Indeed, he says, the symbolism of <em>Arvus</em> of <em>Klal Yisrael</em> with Talmud Torah is likened to the song of a large, magnificent and powerful choir.</p>

<h2>Parshas Nitzavim<br />
Together and One</h2>
<p>With the beginning of the new year just around the corner we greet the final Shabbos of the year with some powerful messages from Parshas Nitzavim. One powerful insight captures the challenge, destiny and opportunity of klal Yisroel and can serve as the impetuous for a most fulfilling <em>Yom haDin</em>.</p>
<p>The parsha begins with Moshe telling klal Yisroel “<em>atem nitzavim hayom</em>” &#8211; “today, you the totality of the Jewish people are standing and making a <em>Bris</em> with <em>Hashem Yisborach</em>. As Moshe speaks to the people he warns them to be wary of the temptations that will confront them and how we will be punished if we sin and as a result become <em>r”l</em> distanced from Him, the source of all good. We are also taught that when we return to him and cling to him, the very consequences that befell us when we erred, will, instead, fall on our enemies. The message is clear we can be assured of our national destiny and strength if we stay close to <em>Hashem Yisborach</em>.<span id="more-6266"></span></p>
<p>Interestingly, however, as the parsha draws to a conclusion the conversation changes and the vernacular shifts from the plural to the singular. The Torah says <em>r’ei nasstai lifanecha hayom es hachaim v’es hatov</em>, &#8211; today I am giving you (as an individual) the power of choice, the ability to make decisions of life and death, of good and bad and of spiritual and the physical. This switch between plural and singular is no accident or error in grammar. <em>Moshe Rabeinu</em> understood that when we speak to the masses each person can think <em>Hashem</em> is talking to someone else. People think the words are for them, not for me. Therefore, Moshe wraps up his message to <em>Am Yisrael</em>, by reminding us that the totality of <em>Klal Israel</em> is comprised of individuals. Each person counts. Each person needs to be responsible. Each person is a treasure. So Moshe shifts to the singular to remind us that it is the collection of each yachid that makes up the <em>Klal</em>.</p>
<p>However, one question still remains. If the power of the people is reflected in the acts of each <em>yachid</em> why speak of the entirety of <em>Am Yisroel</em> in plural at all. Why not focus the remarks singularly on each individual Jew from the very beginning? The answer is profoundly simple. The dual approach is to remind and affirm for us that we are part of a <em>tzibur</em> and every single Jew is a part, <em>meichoteiv eitzecha ad shoev meimecha</em>. From the wood choppers to the water carriers every Jew counts. As each individual perfects his <em>avodas Hashem</em> we create a <em>tzibur</em> that blends the talents and <em>kochos</em> of each and every Jew into one panoramic vista of <em>Am Yisroel</em> of whom <em>Hashem</em> is so proud.</p>
<p>May we be <em>zoche</em> to use the strengths of our avodas <em>Hashem</em> and the responsibility of our arvus to come before the <em>kisei hakovod</em> and be <em>mamlich</em> <em>Hashem Yisborach</em> through the power of our own deeds and the collective strength of our people to be blessed with a <em>shana tova umisuka</em>.</p>

<h2>Parshas Beha&#8217;aloscha<br />
Coming and Going</h2>
<p>The gift of life provides us the opportunity to earn <em>Olam Habah</em>, the ultimate reward for Mitzvah observance and appreciation of Hashem in this world. The trek to eternity leads us to many stations along the roadway of life. Each stop has its own unique significance and impact upon us and our family. How can we be sure to seek the proper destination? What can we do to absorb the spirit of the moment and capture its message in our day to day existence? This week’s parsha lends us a clue.</p>
<p>The Torah describes how the <em>Shechina</em> enveloped the Mishkan with the <em>Ananei Hakovod</em> during the day and a pillar of fire each eve. When the moment arrived for klal yisrael to travel the cloud lifted and started to move. Then, the Aron picked itself up and set forth to lead and Bnei Yisroel followed. When the Jews arrived at their destination, the cloud stopped and the Aron was anchored. Bnei Yisrael pitched their tents and erected the Mishkan.</p>
<p>The Torah uses two different descriptions to define the scenarios of Klal Yisrael’s course through the desert.<span id="more-5689"></span> One description is <em>al pi Hashem <strong>yisu</strong> v&#8217;al bnai Yisrael v’al pi Hashem <strong>yachanu</strong></em> — “through the command of Hashem they traveled and through His word they encamped.” The other phrase is just the opposite, <em>al pi Hashem <strong>yachanu</strong> v’al pi Hashem <strong>yisau</strong></em> &#8211; “through the command of Hashem they encamped and through His word they traveled.”</p>
<p>Our Rabbis explain that the phraseology is reversed to teach us that we must always keep Hashem Yisborach front and center of our lives. Whether we have “just arrived” or are “settled in,” we must be ever cognizant that it is Hashem who made it happen. However, Hakaodsh Baruch Hu leaves it up to us to recognize our obligations. Indeed, it seems easy to follow the Aron while it is on the move. We look up at the Shechina and join the mass of Am Yisrael as we are miraculously carried by the strength of the Tzibbur. But encamped for months and/or years at a time we can become complacent. Al pi Hashem Yachanu, reminds us that wherever we are, the Shechina is present and our responsibilities do not change. Conversely, there are times when we seek to change the status quo, to go off on our own and court new vistas of opportunity. In so doing we must be vigilant to the maxims of our emunah and remember, Al pi Hashem Yisu.</p>
<p><em>Al pi Hashem Yachanu, al pi Hashem Yisau</em>. Hashem comes with us wherever we go and we can make him proud. Indeed, when we go forth with Hashem Yisborach at out side can we achieve all we aspire for. Thus the conclusion of the Posuk becomes ever clearer: <em>es mishmeres Hashem shamaru al pi Hashem b’yad Moshe!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/action.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5652" title="action" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/action-264x300.jpg" alt="" width="264" height="300" /></a>Parshas Nasso deals with two interesting commandments. The first is the law of Sota. Should a man suspect his wife of an adulterous affair, the Torah provides a miraculous method of ascertaining her innocence or guilt. She was brought to the Temple and was given a special concoction to drink. If she was innocent the waters would taste sweet plus she would be blessed with a child. However, if she was guilty, the waters would taste bitter and cause her body to violently explode in a horrible death.</p>
<p>One could imagine the interest such an event would garner. I am sure many people would be very intrigued by this procedure and throngs of people would attend to see just what would happen with this woman.</p>
<p>Directly following the section that teaches us about the Sota. The Torah tells us about the Nazir. A Nazir was someone who wished to live an ascetic life. He would vow not to become ritually impure, he would abstain from drinking wine and would not cut his hair for a specific period of time. Although the Torah does not promote an ascetic existence, the Torah does allow for this form of spiritual growth via the Nazir experience.</p>
<p>The Talmud wonders why Sota is immediately followed by Nazir in the Torah. Normally there is some connection between juxtaposed sections in the Torah. What is the connection between the Sota and the Nazir? Answers the Talmud: “Kol ha’roeh Sota b’kilkula, yazir atzmo min ha’yayin”. Whomever shall see a Sota in her disgrace (ie when she should abstain from wine as a Nazir.</p>
<p>Typically, this is understood to mean that since infidelity can caused by alcohol abuse. One who sees its ugly end would want to ensure the same result not happen to him. Says the Talmud, the best cure for that is to abstain from alcohol via the vow of the Nazir.<span id="more-5651"></span></p>
<p>This is wonderful advice. However, it seems to be a bit counterintuitive. One who has just witnessed the Sota die a violent, horrific death would be the last person we would think who would commit an act of adultery! What better guard against infidelity could there be than to see the Sota’s demise? Why should a person who has seen this be so concerned with the same happening to them? He would be the last one that we should be concerned with?!</p>
<p>Around the corner from Ner Israel in Baltimore MD there was a sign on the side of the road. The sign had an electronic display of the number of deaths by people not wearing seat belts in their cars. The number kept going up. When people noticed the sign it probably made an impact on them. Before cars incessantly reminded you to fasten your seat beat, plenty of people did not use their seat belts. Did they buckle-up after they saw the sign? Maybe once or twice. But by and large, people did not change their habits after seeing the sign. Why not?</p>
<p>The reason is that just because one sees something that reminds them of the right thing, does not mean that they will change their behavior. Inspiration is fleeting. A sign will give a person reason to pause for a moment. But changing one’s life takes real work; real steps to make that change.</p>
<p>Witnessing a Sota in her disgrace is surely a frightening and powerful experience. But the feelings of inspiration won’t last. If you want them to last you need to take action, do real work, make those first real steps to change. That is why one should abstain from wine via the vow of the Nazir. Doing so makes certain that the true desire one has to avoid a cause for sin will take hold. Inspiration and ideas are not enough to create change. Only action creates change.</p>

Behar mostly deals with the laws of Shmita, the Sabbath of the land, and Yovel, the Jubilee celebration every 50 years. The parsha begins with these words:</p>
<p><em>“And God spoke to Moses at mount Sinai, saying: Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When you come into the land which I give you, then the you shall keep a sabbath on the land to God.”</em></p>
<p>Rashi quotes a medrash that asks the Talmudic version of “What does that have to do with the price of tea in china?” In this context, the question is “what does the obligation to keep the Shmita have to do with Mount Sinai?” In other words, why does the Torah emphasize that this mitzvah was given at Sinai?</p>
<p>The answer, says the medrash, is to teach us that just as this mitzvah was given at Sinai with all its details, similarly, all the mitzvos given at Sinai were given with all their details. The Torah goes into more detail about the mitzvah of shmita than some of the other mitzvahs. The details of other mitzvahs were given as part of the oral tradition. The verse reminds us that just as all the details of this mitzvah were given at Sinai (in the written Torah) so too all the details of the other mitzvahs were given at Sinai (albeit in the oral Torah).</p>
<p>This answer begs a new, perhaps bigger question.<span id="more-5592"></span> Why did the Torah teach us this lesson in the context of shmita? There are 613 mitzvahs in the Torah. Any of them could have been elucidated in the written Torah and juxtaposed with a superfluous usage of the words Mount Sinai and we would have been able to learn the very same lesson? Is there something unique that we can learn from the fact that the Torah used the mitzvah of shmita to teach us this lesson?</p>
<p>R’ Schwab answers with an important insight.</p>
<p>Many “scholars” have challenged the authenticity of the Torah. They argue that the Torah was written by humans and was not the word of God. They claim that the Torah is just another book, like any other.</p>
<p>Obviously, we vehemently disagree. We adamantly insist that the Torah is Divine. It is the word of God and along with written Scripture, a Divine communication called the oral law taught us all the details of those complicated laws.</p>
<p>Some mitzvahs sound like a man could have thought of them. The civil code is pretty similar to the civil code of many ancient peoples. The prohibitions against murder and theft are reasonable enough that a human could have thought of them on his own.</p>
<p>However the mitzvah of shmita is one of the least likely mitzvahs to have been invented by humans. The law requires that we let the land lie fallow once every seven years. This is a good idea as it gives the land time to regenerate its nutrients. But it is incredibly dumb to force everyone to have their land lie fallow in the same year! Without some sort of Divine Assistance the entire country would starve. A terrible human plan.</p>
<p>No human author would have legislated a law like that. This law in particular, speaks to the Divine authorship of the Torah.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why the Torah uses this specific mitzvah to teach us that the all of the written Torah and the oral tradition have their origins at Sinai and can be attributed to God alone.</p>
<p>Next week we celebrate Shavuos, the day that we received the Torah from the Almighty. I can think of no better lesson the glean from this week’s Torah reading.</p>

<h2>Parshas Behar &#8211; Bechukosai<br />
Standing Tall</h2>
<p>Parshas Bechukosai commences with the hope and promise of the abundant <em>Birchos Shamayim</em>. All that is expected of us is <em>bichukosai teilechu</em> – <em>shthiyu ameilim baTorah</em>, that we should toil in Torah and in turn receive Hashem’s bountiful blessings. A progressive, ever increasing measure of bracha is presented to us. These brochos, however, are immediately followed by the <em>Tochacha</em>. Sadly, Klal Yisrael knows the trauma and tragedy of this Parsha all too well. Our history is painted with suffering throughout the ages.</p>
<p>With so much bracha to be had, we must explore, where and why does tragedy begin and how <em>b’ezras Hashem</em> it can be prevented. Perhaps the <em>smichus haparshiyos</em> gives us clue.<span id="more-5589"></span></p>
<p>The opening brachos of the Parsha conclude with the words <em>v’oleich eschem kommimiyus.</em> Rashi explains: I will accompany you <em>b’komah zkufah</em> with an upright posture, a proud and regal bearing. Indeed, when all is well with Klal Yisrael, this is the epitome of<em> birchos Shamayim</em>, the ultimate gift – to be able to walk proudly, side by side with the Ribbono Shel Olam as His <em>oveid</em>. Nothing could be greater or more noble. However, this posuk is surprisingly followed by the disastrous statement of the very next verse, <em>v’im lo sishmu li</em> – if you will not listen to Me. Suddenly, tragedy begins. Why? How could there have been such a swift transition from <em>bracha to klalla</em>? How did we go from <em>bichukosei teleichu</em>, walking with Hashem Yisborach <em>b’koma zkufa</em> to r”l, <em>lo sishmu,</em> to not listening?</p>
<p>Perhaps the <em>smichas hapsukim</em> is telling us that the barometer of our devotion to ratzon Hashem or <em>chas v’shalom</em> our demise lies in the sense of <em>kommiyus </em>– the<em> koma zkufa</em>, the noble pride we have in our mitzvah observance. When we stand proud of our yiddishkeit and derive dignity and delight in doing His will, we stand tall. All of His brachos are ours! It is only when there is a break-down, however small it begins, in our sense of the nobility of being His <em>Am Segula</em> that the – possibility of <em>lo sishmu</em> can exist. It is the proud Jew who listens to the Ribbono Shel Olam and <em>kivayachol</em> partners with Him in being an <em>ohr La’amim</em>. It is a role to savor. Only the Jew who, <em>r”l</em>, lacks pride, begins to distance himself from the warm embrace of Hashem Yisborach, His Torah and His mitzvos. Without pride, our motivation to do His will is muted. We turn astray and the <em>Yetzer Harah</em> begins to dominate us until <em>v’lo sishmu</em> becomes the norm.</p>
<p>As we prepare for Shavuos and <em>Kabbolas Hatorah</em> we must remember <em>ashrienu mah tov chelkeinu,</em> we are indeed fortunate to be part of the <em>Am Hanivchar; </em>we are <em>banim laHashem</em>. We must stand proud. As Dovid Hamelech exclaims, <em>Hashem Melech <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Geus</span> Laveish</em>…Hashem Yisborach is cloaked in pride, so can we. In so doing, we can merit a life of bracha filled with nachas from our children who will follow our model and grow to be proud, happy and noble partners with Hakadosh Baruch Hu with a <em>gishmak</em> in <em>avodas Hashem</em> which will continue to inspire future generations. Our <em>limud haTorah</em> and our<em> kiyum hamitzvos</em> – indeed, our very future depend upon it.</p>

<h2>Parshas Emor<br />
U&#8217;Smachtem</h2>
<p>Parshas Emor contains the<em> Parshas HaMoadim</em>, a chapter of Chumash devoted almost exclusively to the <em>Yomim Tovim</em>. Among the many requirements contained therein is the Mitzvah of <em>Simcha</em> to rejoice and be happy on Yom Tov. The Kli Yakar derives a very important lesson from this context. Its message is timeless.</p>
<p>The Mitzvah of <em>usimachtem</em> is recorded by the Yom Tov of Sukkos following the laws of the Arbah Minim. This, he explains, is to teach us that <em>Ein Simchaschem lifnei Hashem ki im b’zman she’heim agudah achas </em>- There is no true Simcha enjoyed with Hashem unless Klal Yisrael is united  <em>b’Achdus</em>, as one. Moreover, we are taught that the mitzvah of Simcha is a constant requirement. A Jew is to live with a Simchas Hachayim each and every day of his or her life. So why is the Mitzvah specified in juxtaposition to the Yom Tov of Sukkos? What is the hidden message being taught?<span id="more-5527"></span></p>
<p>Hashem, he explains, is defining for us the context of simcha. True Simcha is not about self indulgence. Happiness should never be confused with satiating desire or instant gratification. Rather, true joy is found <em>all year long, </em>following the Sukkos formula. Indeed, the spiritual nirvana we are to seek is attained by stepping out of our material confines (into the sukkah), sanctifying the earthly possessions we have produced (arbah Minim), feeling connected and protected by the <em>Shechina</em> on high (<em>schach</em>) as we share His bounty with each of our guests (<em>ushpizin</em>). This is the formula for the healthy Torah lifestyle we can share with our families.</p>
<p>It is especially critical in today’s “instant messaging” era. We can and must learn to refine our goals and aspirations for true happiness. Only when we neutralize the material competitiveness which disunites us and discover the true joy of spirit the world of Torah, Mitzvos and Ma&#8217;asim Tovim provide us can we truly connect with each other and to Hashem Yisborach as one.</p>

<h2>Parshas Acharey Mos &#8211; Kedoshim<br />
Breaking Barriers</h2>
<p>Parshas Kedoshim is chockful of Mitzvos, all of which direct us toward the goal of living a Torah life imbued with the mantra of <em>Kedoshim Tihiyu</em>. At first glance, one such Mitzvah seems so easy, yet, according to the Ohr Hachayim Hakodesh, it is a constant struggle. Indeed, it is a Mitzvah which expands or r”l constrains our Kedushah potential. It is the Mitzvah of <em>elohei maseicha lo sa’aseh lach. </em></p>
<p>Most of the mifarshei hamikrah focus this commandment on the <em>azahara</em> to not even fashion idols for others. However, with the Yetzer Harah for idolatry neutered by Chazal, we find the whole notion of idolatry repugnant, even silly. Furthermore, as the Ohr Hachayim Hakadosh points out, this issur is already included in the general Halachos of avoda zara. He therefore renders a different approach that is especially inspirational during this sefira season.<span id="more-5487"></span></p>
<p>He explains, “when a person performs a mitzvah, the Shechina rests upon him. But when one r”l does an aveira, a ruach tumah sets upon him  – v’hu <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">masach</span> hamavdil beino uvein Elokav</em> &#8211; it forms a barrier between him and the Ribbono Shel Olam.” Comes the Torah to teach us, with all of the bounty I have provided you – strive for Kedusha. The secret: <em>elohei maseicha lo sa’aseh lach</em>, do not create barriers between yourself and Hakadosh Baruch Hu. Why? The posuk continues, “Ani Hashem Elokeichem” -  for I am Hashem your G-d. When our relationship is barrier free we can appreciate the reality of Hashem Yisborach’s kindness and hashgocha, 24/7. Barrier free, we can appreciate the gift of Torah u’mitzvos and our opportunity and responsibility of being an ohr la’amim. With out any obstacles in the way, the road to perfection is smooth traveling. It seems so easy.</p>
<p>But as the Rambam explains, when one succumbs to temptation, he can get stuck in the quagmire of <em>cheit</em>. In so doing, layer of upon layer of thicker and thicker material form a blockade between the Shechina and the <em>neshama</em> so desperate to see its Father. We can degrade into the ultimate<em> hester panim</em>, as a thick iron curtain of sin obstructs our view of Kudsha Brich Hu until He seems almost non-existent, chas v’shalom. This was the most pernicious impact of the golden calf, the e<em>igel maseicha</em> which Klal Yisrael fashioned in the desert. And sadly, that barrier to giluy shechina and the clarity of the luchos rishonos is still with us today. We are challenged to  tear down the vestiges of the eigel hazahav’s obstruction to emunah found in each generation and eliminate as well the impediments to emunah rooted in our own personal iniquities.</p>
<p>How can we succeed?  Sefiras Ha’omer provides the answer. We count toward matan Torah. One day at a time, we dismantle the barricades. Through Talmud Torah, <em>asiyas HaMitzvos</em> and refinement of our middos, we invite, as the Ohr Hachayim points out, the Shechina back into our lives and in so doing we eliminate the barriers found along the way. Indeed, with the avodah of each day’s count, we can, <em>b’ezras Hashem</em>, eliminate the hindrances to revelation and spiritual clarity. Inching ever closer to feel His presence, and achieving a life lived as kedoshim -<em> ki kadosh ani Hashem Elokeichem!</em></p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Tazria-Metzora<br />
Toras HaYoledes</h2>
<p>The study of <em>smichas haparshiyos</em> always reveals fascinating insights into the inner meanings of Torah. Text and context are so vital in shaping the values and mores that are to shape our outlook as well. One significant message is presented by Chazal as we traverse the <em>yesodos</em> of <em>parshas</em> Shimini, read last week, and begin the study of <em>parshas</em> Metzorah this Shabbos. It is a bridge which reminds us of the proper context of our <em>avodas </em>Hashem still today.</p>
<p>Chazal note that <em>parshas</em> Shmini concludes by summing up the laws of <em>kashrus</em> using the phrase, “<em>zos Toras habihama.” </em>Our <em>parsha</em> begins with the renewal of human existence and the birth of children entering the world and the words “<em>zos Toras hayoledes.”</em> The commentaries wonder why the <em>Toras habihama</em> precedes the <em>Toras haadam</em>. Surely, it is people who are the focus of creation. Shouldn’t we study the creation of man and then follow it with the <em>Toras habihama?</em> What is to be understood from the sequence of these <em>psukim</em>?<span id="more-5455"></span></p>
<p>To answer this question, the Midrash introduces the <em>parsha</em> with the <em>posuk</em> from Tehillim (139:4) <em>Achor vakedem tzartani</em> <em>— “</em>backwards and forwards You shaped me<em>.” </em>Says R’ Yishmael bar Tanchum <em>“Achor l’chal hamaasim v’kodem l’chol ha’onshim&#8230;— </em>you are last with regards to your actions (you are the pinnacle of creation), yet you are the first for all of consequences (if you abuse life)<em>.”  </em>The Midrash continues—if you are worthy then all of creation was prepared for you. However if <em>r”l</em> one is unworthy then even the gnat has preceded you in<em> ma’aseh breishis. </em></p>
<p>The message of this lesson is powerful. Of all the creatures of the world, only human kind needs guidance and training to be successful. Beavers need not attend engineering school. Fish do not take swimming lessons and bees are exempt from food chemistry courses. It is only people that need education and coaching to master their destiny and fulfill their role in this world. Our performance is in our own hands. Chazal are reminding us that the sequence of <em>Toras habihama</em> preceding <em>Toras haadam</em> is to deliver context and meaning to our spiritual destiny. If we learn, study and continually grow, then the <em>Toras habihama</em> and indeed, the entire world is the gift which greets us to enjoy a beautiful world filled with all of His bounty. By providing us a world ready with all that we need, Hakadosh Baruch Hu has given each of us all of the tools we could possibly desire to achieve our spiritual destiny. We can rise to the apex of piety and the spiritual nirvana toward which we aspire to soar.  But, if the gift of life and the opportunity to do <em>mitzvos</em> are not taken advantage of, and His bountiful blessings are wasted through our apathy, indifference and self-centered laziness, resulting in sin, then we are truly no different than the insignificant gnat created early on in the six days of creation. In fact we are worse. They, after all, are fulfilling their prescribed role but we, who have free choice, are not doing ours. What a waste.</p>
<p>As we progress through the “count-up” to Shavuos, this lesson is a vital reminder of our personal and national mission as an <em>ohr l’amim</em>. We can only illuminate the world if we are willing to use His gifts to bring <em>kavod</em> and glory to His name through our actions. That is the true purpose of life, to take the <em>Toras habihama</em> and all of the <em>olam hagashmi</em> it symbolizes and sanctify it through the spiritual potential of <em>Toras haadam</em>.</p>

<h2>Parshas Shemini<br />
Darosh Darash</h2>
<p>With this week’s parsha we find ourselves at the midpoint of  Toraseinu. Chazal are fascinated by the fact that the first half of the Torah ends and the second half of the Torah begins with the same word. We are told (Vayikra 10:16)  <em>“v’es se’ir hachatass darosh darash Moshe.” </em>Moshe urgently sought out whether or not the details of the sacrificial service rites had been performed correctly. Despite the horrific tragedy of the death of Aharon Hakohein’s two precious sons (Moshe’s nephews!), Moshe, assertively inquired, a double expression of Doreish,  as to whether or not the<em> ratzon Hashem</em> was being fulfilled and to the very last specific detail.<span id="more-5417"></span></p>
<p>It is no coincidence that this phrase, <em>darosh-darash</em>, is at the very center of the Torah. This teaches us not only about Moshe Rabbeinu but about what ought to be front and center of our lives each day. <em>Darosh-darash</em>, it is the end and beginning of everything. <em>Darosh-darash</em>, we are being reminded that assertively seeking out Hashem Yisborach, finding fulfillment in talmud Torah and striving to be meticulous in our standard of Mitzvah observance is at the heart of our spiritual destiny. Like Moshe Rabbeinu, even when tragedy strikes our life is anchored with <em>darosh-darash</em>, probing, seeking and searching for an even  greater spiritual relationship with Hashem Yisborach. He is everywhere.</p>
<p>However, we need not wait, <em>rachmana litzlan</em>, for catastrophe to strike. Blessed with His bountiful goodness, He gives us the opportunity to see Him in the <em>hashgacha pratis</em> that governs our life each day. <em>Darosh-darash</em>, from matters of <em>parnasah</em> to family, work to play, He is there holding our hand and guiding us along the way.</p>
<p>We are told that the Baal Shem Tov once  asked his students, “Where is Hashem?” Not one of their answers was satisfactory. Finally the students turned to their mentor in wonder, and asked “So, Rebbe, where is He?” Responded the Besh”t , — “Hashem, He is wherever <em>you </em>let Him in!”</p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Pesach 2012</h2>
<p>Shir Hashirim Shlomo Hameelech’s great Song of Songs, teaches us just how much <em>kivayachol</em>, Hashem Yisborach loves us. This relationship is <em>kodesh kadashim</em> but is so difficult to comprehend. Nevertheless, it is part and parcel of the <em>zman cheiruseinu</em>. In fact, it is of the deepest fundamental <em>yesodos</em> of our Pesach experience. It is the ambition we seek in our <em>Sede</em> ritual. How are we to capture its essence and elevate our <em>yom tov</em> sensation to the madreiga of “<em>ahavas klulosayich</em>” which we all aspire to feel? One midrash can help.<span id="more-5338"></span></p>
<p>Most our familiar with the phrase from Shir Hashirim, <em>kol dodi henei zeh ba</em>. We are familiar as well with the <em>medrashic</em> statement <em>zeh Melech haMashiach</em>!  However, many are not well versed with the entirety of the medrash. Let us explore further. As this powerful <em>aggadah</em> in Shir Hashirim Rabbah (2:19) commences it states; <em>“R’ Yehuda omeir kol dodi zeh Moshe Rabbeinu</em>” and it begins a narrative which is repeated with a series of variations all echoing an identical theme. Says the <em>medrash</em>, when Moshe Rabbeinu announced to klal Yisrael that it is time for you to be redeemed they responded, how so? Could it be true that the time for geula has arrived? It is not yet time (400 years have not passed), we are not worthy, we have no <em>maasim tovim</em> and we have <em>r”l </em>filled the streets of Mitzryaim with our worship of <em>avodah zarah</em>? How could we be <em>roei</em> for <em>geula</em>?</p>
<p>The medrash records Moshe response. It is written in two ways with a very a subtle disparity between them. In one instance the Medrash records that Moshe told Klal Yisrael, do not worry,<em> ho’eel v’Hu chafetz b’geluaschem eino mabit b’maseichem haraaim</em>. Since He (Hashem Yisborach) wants to redeem you, He looks not at your actions and He will take you out of Mitzrayim. In the subsequent report of Moshe Rabbeinu’s conversation with Klal Yisrael an almost identical refrain is provided. Just one word is different, the word <em>v’Hu</em> (and He) is left out. Instead it reads <em>ho’eel v’chafetz b’geulaschem eino mabit</em>. . . this can be understood to mean since you, Klal Yisrael, truly desire <em>geula</em> and the connection to the Shechina it brings, Hashem Yisborach will overlook your iniquities and deliver you from the bondage of Egypt!</p>
<p>In other words, Moshe Rabbeinu tells Bnai Yisrael, Hashem Yisborach’s decision to ignore our <em>aveiros</em> and provide us with <em>geula</em> is dependent upon our desire to be closer to Him. If we want it – it will be! Such is the <em>ahavas klulosayich, </em>our a bi-directional relationship with Kiviyachol, the Ribbono Shel Olam. We need to give ourselves to Him and He, in turn, gives Himself to us. Indeed, the more we want Him in our lives the more He will allow us to feel His presence in all that we do. That is the essence of the <em>Ahava</em> – the loving and giving that we must feel for Hakadosh Baruch Hu if we want to feel His love in our lives.</p>
<p><em>Kol dodi henei zeh bah</em>. We must remember that the triumph of the <em>seder</em> ritual is found in attaining the<em> </em>relationship<em> </em>of a<em>havas klulosayich. </em>It is the ultimate <em>Avodah </em>of the Seder experience. Beginning with the <em>arabah kosos</em>, it is the goal we seek as we ascend the fifteen steps of the <em>simanei haseder.</em> Each one brings us ever closer to the ultimate <em>dveikus baShechina</em>. If we are successful we arrive to the <em>madreiga</em> of <em>nirtzah - </em>where our want for Him is matched by His desire for us. What a valuable message for us all; He is waiting for us still! We know that Mitzrayim is the quintessential definition of the <em>geula</em> paradigm. A <em>geula </em>we need now more than ever. And more than ever, it depends on us. We need to want it so He will too. We must ask ourselves, <em>tzipisa liyeshua</em>? Are we anticipating salvation? The <em>kol hataor</em>, the voice of <em>mashiach</em> is waiting for ours to join him song. Why not now? Surely, it is time for us all to sing.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayakhel-Pekudei<br />
The House the Moshe Built</h2>
<p><strong>T</strong>he Mishkan completed and assembled is described by the mifarshim as the “house that Moshe built.” Chazal tell us that although Betzalel, Ahaliav, and a variety of artisans, smiths and craftsmen did their respective jobs, Moshe is credited with the Mishkan’s completion.  This is because Moshe not only oversaw the construction of the Mishkan  but was <em>Moser Nefesh—totally dedicated</em> to its design and completion.</p>
<p>This is so typical of Moshe Rabbeinu, who selflessly shepherded Klal Yisrael through forty years in the desert.<span id="more-5280"></span> He gave his all for Hakadosh Baruch Hu, His Torah and Klal Yisrael. In describing Moshe Rabbeinu’s legacy, the Midrash opens the Parsha by quoting the Posuk from Mishlei, <em>“</em><em>Ish emunas rav brachos&#8221;</em>—a man of faith has many brachos. This posuk, we’re told, teaches us that <em>kol mi shehu ne’eman Hakadosh Baruch Hu mavi brachos al  yado</em>—“whoever possesses emuna, Hashem Yisborach brings brocha through his hands.” The mifarshim explain that this is not only limited to Moshe Rabbeinu but refers to all those who act like him. Moreover, we are being taught that there is a direct correlation between the brachos we receive and provide to others and our own faith in Hashem Yisborach.</p>
<p>Indeed we are being taught that each of us can each be like Moshe in regard to one specific domain: emuna. How can this be? Is it really possible to replicate the emunah of Moshe Rabbeinu who spoke, kivyachol, to Hashem <em>panim el Panim</em>-face to face? The answer is an emphatic “yes”.</p>
<p>What is emuna? Rav Avigdor Miller zt”l explains that emuna is not simply faith but rather, <em>loyalty</em>. Therein lies the key. We are all supposed to be loyal, devoted and dedicated to the Ratzon Hashem. Emunah is not merely about a feeling of spiritual connectivity that we can take for granted and reflect upon when convenient. That’s only a start. It is about more deeply committing ourselves to Him day in and day out. Putting His will first and our needs second. It is about becoming a skilled, master craftsman of Hashem’s desire, personifying His will in each move we make. In good times and moments more challenging, our loyalty makes the difference.  True, we may never reach the madreiga of a Moshe Rabbeinu. Yet as much as we cannot achieve his “reach,” we <em>can</em> match his effort. We can give 100% of <em>our</em> devotion to Hashem Yisborach and access His shefa brachos to enrich our lives, those of our family, and all of Klal Yisrael, IY”H .</p>

<h2>Parshas Ki Sisa<br />
Hashem&#8217;s Tfillin</h2>
<p>We find in Parshas Ki Sissa the catastrophic sin of the <em>eigel hazahav</em>, which tragically placed Klal Yisrael at the precipice of destruction. Moshe Rabbeinu beseeches Hakadosh Baruch Hu on our behalf. He successfully assuages Hashem Yisborach’s anger and insured our survival to this very day. Realizing that he was privileged to experience an obvious <em>eis ratzon</em>, Moshe is emboldened to ask for a keener understanding of Hashem Yisborach. He implores Hakadosh Baruch Hu, “<em>Hareini nah es Kvodecha”</em>- to reveal Himself, to offer His <em>eved</em> a more comprehensive understanding of who He is. Hashem Yisborach responds by saying “<em>v’raisa es acharei upanei lo yerau</em>” – no human can see the full, frontal glory of Hashem. You, Moshe, therefore cannot see My “front,” but I will reveal to you My “back.”</p>
<p>Hakadosh Baruch Hu’s enigmatic response to Moshe’s request is hard to understand.<span id="more-5262"></span> We attribute no real anthropomorphisms to Hashem Yisborach. Moreover, how does this address Moshe Rabbeinu’s request to understand Hakadosh Baruch Hu? Seemingly, Moshe is asking to understand the depth of Hashem’s compassion for Klal Yisrael who He has just spared from annihilation. Rashi, too, is concerned with understanding the posuk and quotes the Chazal that declares that showing His back to Moshe meant that <em>Her’ahu kesher shel Tfillin – </em>Hashem Yisborach showed Moshe the knot of His tfillen shel rosh. This only seems to confound us further. How does this answer Moshe’s request? And what are we to learn from this episode today?</p>
<p>The Gemara in maseches B’rachos teaches that Hashem Yisborach indeed wears Tfillin. Unlike our tfillin which contain the parsha of Shma Yisrael, our affirmation of kabbolos ol malchus Shamayim, Hashem’s Tfillin contain the posuk<em> Mi k’amcha Yisrael</em> &#8211; &#8220;who is like My people Israel?&#8221;. Amazingly, Hashem Yisborach’s T’fillin reflect His love and relationship with us, His chosen people. Perhaps this explains our query.</p>
<p>Moshe Rabbeinu successfully defended Klal Yisrael from their terrible sin of the golden calf. He invoked the <em>yud-gimmel middos</em> and recalled the zechuyos of our avos, Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov. But what, <em>k’vyachol,</em> was the source of Hashem’s forgiveness? It was the simple fact that, despite our iniquities, He loves us. Moshe Rabbeinu wondered if there was more. Says Hakadosh Baruch Hu, the depth of My <em>ahava</em> cannot be understood by the living. However, My <em>relationship </em>with you can be. He communicated that by showing Moshe the kesher shel Tfillin. In this case, “kesher” does not refer to a <em>knot</em> being shown to Moshe. Rather, it’s the <em>Kesher</em> <em>– </em>the<em> relationship</em> of Mi k’amcha Yisrael, represented by the tefillin of Hashem Yisborach. Moshe then came to appreciate the essential ideal that our kabbalos ol malchus shamayim and relationship with Hashem Yisborach is a two way connection. We are not only expected to love Hakadosh Baruch Hu but we are gifted with Him loving us back!</p>
<p>It was this relationship that saved us and it is this relationship that ought to inspire us each day. As we proclaim, <em>Shema Yisrael Hashem Elokeinu Hashem Echad</em> thrice daily, we must always remember that Hashem Yisborach proclaims <em>Mi k’amcha Yisrael</em>. We have but to be worthy of His heart to stay in touch with our own.</p>

<h2><em></em>Parshas Titzaveh<br />
Viyikchu Li- Viyikchu Eilecha</h2>
<p>The <em>parshiyos </em>of <em>Terumah </em>and <em>Tetzaveh </em>follow the exclamation of <em>na’aaseh v’nishma</em> which concludes <em>parshas Mishpatim.</em> Each <em>parsha</em> begins with the word <em>v’yikchu</em>, you should take. <em>Terumah</em> commences with <em>viyikchu <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Li </span>teruma</em>—take for Me (Hashem) and <em>Titzaveh</em> opens with <em>viyikchu <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eilecha</span></em> take for you. What is about the building of the <em>Mishkan</em> that helps us make this transition from taking and giving to Hashem to acquiring for ourselves? What can we learn from it today? One approach is found in how Chazal explain the relationship between <em>matan Torah</em> and the <em>hakomas hamishkan.</em></p>
<p>Chazal teach us that the relationship of <em>hakoras hatov</em> &#8211; expressing appreciation, is integrally bound up with the <em>matan Torah</em> experience. Indeed, it is only after <em>Klal Yisrael</em> receives the most precious of gifts, our priceless Torah, that Hashem Yisborach directs us to build a <em>Mishkan</em> and fashion the <em>Aron</em> to hold the <em>Luchos</em>, a <em>Menorah </em>to illuminate our lives, a <em>Shulchan</em> to dedicate our worldly assets to the <em>Borei Olam</em> and construct two diatinct <em>mizbachos</em> to harness our m<em>esiras nefesh</em> which provide the sweet fragrance and aroma that should innately surround every Jew.<span id="more-5223"></span></p>
<p>The reality is that the <em>Mishkan</em> itself was to be our tool to express the ultimate sense of appreciation to <em>Hashem Yisborach</em> for elevating our stature, as He selected us as His chosen people. Though priceless in value, we somehow attempt to thank Hashem for bestowing His royal status upon us, giving us His Torah and calling us His children. This we express through our drive to fulfill <em>viyikchu Li</em> to give to Hashem—as we build and serve in the <em>Mishkan</em>. Once we have generously been thankful to Him we are allowed to enjoy <em>vikchu eilecha</em> to take for ourselves the gifts of health, happiness and <em>nachas</em> he has bestowed upon us each and every day.</p>
<p>Only by giving to Him do we truly take for ourselves!</p>
<p>But there is more, another nuance that deepens the message. One cannot help but notice that the venue of <em>viyikchu eilecha</em> is prefaced with the charge <em>v’ata titzaveh es bnai Yisrael</em> – <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> should command klal Yisrael. Although the technical <em>tzivui</em> of the <em>parsha</em> is related to the preparation of oil for the <em>menorah</em>, Chazal teach us that the essence of the beginning of the parsha is really is about the transmission of our Mesorah through <em>Torah Shebaal Peh</em> as represented by the<em> menorah</em>. We are being taught <em>v’ata titzaveh</em> – you must command and transmit the <em>Torah</em> to another generation. Each Jew must view this responsibility as a personal obligation. For only through the authentic transmission of <em>mesorah</em> will we be able to serve as the <em>ohr la’amim Hashem Yisborach</em> intended.</p>
<p>When we combine these two ideas we are left with a profound message. Indeed, we are being taught that the pivotal criterion in transitioning from <em>viyikchu li into viykchu eilecha</em> is our fidelity to the transmission of Torah <em>shebaal peh</em>. When we follow through on our responsibility to pass the torch of Torah forward, bestow that legacy to our children and cloak them with the mantle of leadership to themselves be transmitters of Torah we are then empowered to actualize all of His gifts for a life filled with the Yiddishe <em>Nachas</em> for which we strive.</p>

<h2>Parshas Terumah<br />
Serve Hashem with Radiance!</h2>
<p>The annual study of the construction of the Mishkan is always exciting. The repository of the Shechina, the Mishkan is not a simple building by any means. Indeed, the deep symbolism of each and every aspect of the design, materials and construction process is chock full of practical messages and lessons for us to live by. Let us explore one fascinating facet further.</p>
<p>The Torah teaches that uppermost cover upon the roof of the Mishkan was fitted with the skin of <em>Techashim</em>.  Chazal explain that the <em>Tachash</em> was a unicorn. It was a strikingly beautiful animal with a single horn. It was comprised of six colors which caught the eye of all who were deeply mesmerized by its sheer magnificence. Miraculously, the Tachash appeared in the <em>midbar</em> during the construction of the <em>mishkan </em>to gift its fleece to the House of Hashem after which, it disappeared forever to become a legend.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Hashem Yisborach commanded that our house of worship be enveloped by this multi-color skin. This was to symbolize for us the differentiated persona of each of the Shevatim who themselves would later be represented by their own colored flag, unique symbol and precious stone. Klal Yisrael was not expected to be the same. As an icon of ritual, the resting place of the Shechina, the Mishkan, was teaching us how to serve the Roibbon Shel Olam. Our <em>avoda</em> would need to be vibrant, radiant and colorful, so to speak, reflecting how we each were to bring our own personal <em>kochos</em> to our <em>avodas</em> Hashem. Only then could we hope for perfection.<span id="more-5195"></span></p>
<p>The Meam Loez, presents an even deeper insight. He notes that the Targum translates the word for the aforementioned unicorn, the Tachash as “<em>sassgavn</em>a.” <em>Sassgavna,</em> according to the Meam Loez, is really an anagram of the two words “Sas” to rejoice and “Gavna” colors. It teaches us that the Tachash itself <em>“samcha b’liba al rov gvanim shebah,</em>” that the unicon rejoiced and celebrated in its heart on account of its multicolored hues! It was <em>b’simcha</em>. Not because it was the same as everything (and everyone) else but because it was unique, colorful and stunningly distinct. This idea, too, must be part of our understanding of what our <em>avoda</em> is to be.</p>
<p><em>Mi shenichnas Adar marbin b’simcha.</em> We must learn from the <em>Tachash</em>, the <em>sassgavna</em>. We must remember that we are not expected or even encouraged to serve Hashem Yisborach only in black and white. Our <em>ahavas</em> Hashem and <em>yiras</em> Shamayim must be characterized by the full spectrum of color symbolized by the roof which capped the Mishkan. Enveloped in color, it was the perfect home to host the <em>Keruvim</em> and house the Aron which contained the <em>Luchos haEidus </em>we still live by. Indeed, each Yid has a role to play, a color to broadcast and an individual task to fulfill. Using our <em>kochos</em> responsibly we can feel our own shade and hue shine forth from our soul and find the fulfillment in our <em>avoda</em> Hashem Yisborach intends. Doing so we will find our selves with that Tachash  sense of <em>simcha</em> as we become the <em>sassgavna</em> – rejoicing and celebrating the <em>shelamus</em> of reaching our potential and the multi-colored, distinctive approach to avodas Hashem of each and every Jew.</p>

<h2>Parshas Mishpatim<br />
Learn With Your Children!</h2>
<p>The conclusion of <em>parshas </em>Mishpatim features a return to the description <em>matan </em>Torah. We are told how Moshe Rabbeinu alighted Har Sinai. Upon his return, Moshe told Bnai Yisrael <em>es kol divrei Hashem v’es kol hamishpatim</em> &#8211; all the words of Hashem and all of His laws. Klal Yisrael responded in unison and proclaimed, “<em>kol divrei Hashem na’aseh.</em>” Whatever Hashem says we will do. This is the second time since the saga of <em>matan</em> Torah began to unfold that Bnai Yisrael responds to the gift of the Torah with an emphatic <em>na’aseh</em> &#8211; we will do! Nevertheless, despite the sincere motivation of Am Yisrael, their declaration of <em>na’aseh</em> is simply not enough. Finally, <em>kabbolas HaTorah</em> reaches its zenith a few Psukim later as, Klal Yisrael exclaims <em>na’aseh v’nishma! </em>Crowned with this most famous, wondrous refrain of &#8211; <em>we will do and we will hear</em>, <em>matan</em> Torah is complete. We are gifted the <em>Torah Hak’dosha</em> for eternity.</p>
<p>What caused the change in our response? Why did we jump from <em>na’aseh</em> to <em>nishma</em>? What finally inspired us?<span id="more-5169"></span></p>
<p>The Midrash tells us that during <em>matan </em>Torah<em>, Hashem Yisborach</em> demanded a guarantor from Klal Yisrael that we would watch and protect the gift of Torah being granted to them. At first, Klal Yisrael suggested the Avos. However, Hashem said no. Klal Yisrael then suggested <em>shamayim va’aretz</em>. Again, Hakadosh Baruch Hu refused. Finally, B’nai Yisrael offered their children to secure their commitment to Torah. This Hashem accepted.</p>
<p>This Midrash appears to be derived from the verses leading up to the <em>na’aseh v’nishma</em> declaration. Following the second affirmation of na’aseh we are told <em>vayishalch es na’arei Yisrael</em> &#8211; that the youngsters of Bnai Yisrael were sent out to bring a sacrifice. Afterwards, Moshe sprinkled the blood on the <em>mizbeyach</em> and read the Torah to the people. Only now they proclaimed <em>na’aseh v’nishma. </em>Why? Initially Klal Yisrael felt <em>Matan Torah</em> was for adults only. For themselves they were ready to proclaim and commit to <em>na’aseh</em>, personal <em>mitzvah</em> observance. However, they soon recognized that it was the youth who successfully brought the <em>korban </em>needed to complete the <em>matan </em>Torah experience. Bnai Yisrael then offered their children as the guarantor of <em>Kabolas HaTorah. </em>As they did so, they came to the realization that <em>matan</em> Torah was not just for them but it was for their<em> kinderlach</em> and generations to come.</p>
<p>Now a process for <em>mesorah </em>would need to be established to assure the effective transmission of our holy Torah from generation to generation. Thus <em>na’aseh </em><em>v’nishma</em> was the call. Effective transmission of our <em>mesorah</em> calls for a commitment to doing and more importantly to hearing and learning! This awareness is critical for us to protect and assure the <em>mesorah</em> we guaranteed to our antecedents and that our children insure for us. Indeed, being <em>mikabelei </em>Torah and strengthening our link in the chain requires that we reclaim that <em>na’aseh v’nishma</em> attitude. No, it is not enough to send our children to <em>yeshiva</em>. We must do and we must learn . .  . . . . with our  children!</p>

<h2>Parshas Bo<br />
A Good Time</h2>
<p><em></em><em>Parshas Bo</em> heralds the birth of<em> </em><em>Klal Yisrael </em>as the <em></em><em>Am Segulah</em>. So profound are the events contained therein that they define our destiny as <em>banim la’Makom</em> till today. Most importantly, one detail in the <em>Parsha</em> is so fundamental that it singularly defines the spiritual mission of every Jew. Surprisingly; our <em>tachlis Hachayim</em> is not defined by the climactic conclusion of the <em>eser makkos</em>, the <em>korban Pesach</em> or even our physical exodus from <em>Mitzrayim</em>. Rather the essence of Klal Yisrael is wrapped in the ribbon of the very first Mitzvah gifted to us by Hashem Yisborach; the mitzvah of <em>Kiddush Hachodesh</em>.<span id="more-5089"></span></p>
<p>The Torah teaches us,<em> Hachodesh hazeh lachem. </em>This <em>posuk</em> Rashi points out, in the very first verse of <em>sefer Breishis</em>, is where the Torah should begin, s<em>hehi mitzvah rishona shenitztavu Yisrael. </em>Essentially, the Torah commences right here with <em>Kiddush Hachodesh, </em>a gift which is <em>lachem, </em>exclusively <em>Klal Yisrael’s</em> Why? And how does it define us <em>l’olmei olamim. </em></p>
<p><em>Kiddush Hachodesh</em>, our first national mitzvah is much more than the complex formulae to be used in calculating the lunar cycle. It is about time and our unique relationship to it. It is about <em>Kiddushas Hazman</em> and the ability of the <em>basor v’dam</em> to define it in this world and the next. Empowered by the <em>Ribbono Shel Olam</em>, as we are, to control time, even the <em>malachei hashareis</em> must consult <em>with B’nei  Yisrael </em>to know when the <em>Yomim Tovim</em> are scheduled!, We are charged to create <em>moadim</em>. Indeed, <em>Lakol zman va’eis,</em> we can create an <em>eis </em><em>la’ssos</em> for every opportunity. It is an amazing task that only a <em>Yid</em> can do. This is the Torah paradigm for <em>zman</em> – so lovingly placed in our hands as our first <em>mitzvah</em>. It is for us to give meaning and reality to each and every tick of the clock.</p>
<p><em>Mikadeish Yisrael v’hazmanim, </em> Kiddush Hachodesh is the very first national <em>mitzvah</em> and <em>kedushas hazman</em> is our national <em>tachlis</em>. Even before the actual <em>geulas Mitzrayim</em>, <em>Hashem Yisborach</em> is teaching us that it is up to us make each moment count. The gift of freedom is not for every individual to do what he wants when he wants. That is anarchy. Instead, time is life. And <em>cheirus</em> is the opportunity to use time well, to find in it a purpose and fill life with meaning.</p>
<p>Given the power of time and our responsibility to use it wisely it is no wonder that our national destiny begins with this very <em>mitzvah</em>. Its message is more critical today than ever. What do we do with our time? How much do we learn? Do we make time for our families?  Are we giving time back to the <em>klal</em>? How do we leisure? Do we invest time, find it, waste it or <em>r”l</em> try and kill it. It is, after all, our most precious resource and our most unique gift.</p>
<p>For Klal Yisrael, the ongoing epoch which began with Yitzias Mitzrayim and Matan Toarah and continues with our kiyum hamitzvos and limud Hatorah still today,  is all about time. Let us be devoted to using it well.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vaera<br />
Light Unto the Nations</h2>
<p>The devastation of Mitzrayim during the 10 plagues left the Egyptian landscape changed forever. Clearly the purpose of the <em>makkos</em>was not merely the exodus of Klal Yisrael from the tyrannical rule of Pharoah. After all, Hashem could have just escorted all the Jews out of Egypt in one fell swoop. What then was the objective of the 10 -step staged destruction of Egypt, its culture and people?</p>
<p>The Kli Yakar explains that the makkos were to provide a <em>tikkun</em> for the lack of <em>emuna</em> which was pervasive in the <em>Mitzri</em> culture. Pharoah denied Hashem’s existence and omnipotence. Pharoah tells Moshe, “I know not of Hashem, nor will I listen to Him.” Yet, as each plague descends upon Egypt, Pharaoh and the Mitzriyim are systematically and progressively shown that <em>Hashem Hu HaElokim, bashamayim u’varetz</em>! They have no choice but to recognize His <em>hashgacha</em> over all. As the <em>Yad Hashem</em> becomes ever clear with each and every plague the ultimate goal of the ten <em>makkos</em> is realized until it climaxes with the declaration <em>l’maan sapehr Sh&#8217;mi.<span id="more-5063"></span></em></p>
<p>Ultimately, Pharaoh and his people are taught that it is not merely enough to acknowledge the<em> Ribbono Shel Olam</em>’s presence in this world. We must do our best ”<em>l’maan sapehr Sh&#8217;mi</em>”- to proclaim His reality to all. Eventually the Egyptians got the point. Klal Yisrael is ejected from the throes of their servitude. <em>Geula</em> is at hand.</p>
<p>However, this lesson was not meant for the Mitzrim alone. It is really intended for us. With the revelation of Sinai close at hand, <em>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</em> was paving the way for the true purpose of <em>geula</em>; to become an “<em>ohr la’amim</em>,” a light to all nations. The soon to be experienced <em>Matan Torah</em>, would gift us with the tools for <em>Kiddush Shem Shamayim</em>, enabling us to be His ambassadors for <em>kedusha</em> in this world. Our awareness of <em>l’maan sapehr Sh&#8217;mi</em> and our commitment to implementing that attitude in each aspect of our lives, 24/7, is the final step in the preparatory process for redemption. It is an opportunity and responsibility for every ben and bas Yisrael which can bring the <em>geula</em> closer each day.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Vayechi<br />
Smile!</h2>
<p>As Yaakov Avinu blesses his children he describes each of their traits and challenges. On the one hand he encourages them and prods them to correct their errors, and on the other he identifies some of their unique <em>kochos</em> as he urges them to aspire to maximize their own individual potential. Interestingly, he doesn’t demand that they all be the same. The <em>shivtei kah</em> were each different, each with their own unique relationship with <em>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</em> and personal approach of <em>avodas</em> Hashem. In the totality of Klal Yisrael it is the sum total of our differences which maximize the <em>avoda</em> of the <em>klal</em> in our collective <em>avodas</em> Hashem. That is what is of supreme importance. Perish the thought of us all being the same and narrowing the venues for <em>hisgalus kvod shamayim</em> to a limited <em>mehalach hachayim</em> which embraces only a singular path. Klal Yisrael is stronger and mightier than that.<span id="more-5013"></span></p>
<p>Studying the brachos given by Yaakov Avinu to his twelve sons teaches us much about the breadth and diversity of our people. There is so much to learn from each <em>shevet</em> (and each other). One can even attempt to see where he or she fits in to the scheme of the fabric of <em>Am Yisrael</em> as defined by the birchas Yaakov. Indeed, we can find ourselves, our potential and our ability to give meaning to the <em>chol hayam</em> by understanding what we can be as <em>kochvei hashamayim</em>.</p>
<p>One especially poignant message is found in the <em>bracha</em> given to Yehuda. It provides us a paradigm for healthy leadership and for being the example to others each of us is expected to be.</p>
<p>As he completes defining the attributes of Yehuda’s leadership of <em>Malchus Bais Dovid</em>, Yaakov <em>bentches</em> Yehuda with the phrase, <em>chachleelee einayim miyayin uliven shinayim meichalav</em>, translated, Yaakov wished Yehuda that his eyes be red with wine and his teeth be white from milk. Mifarshim wonder what does it mean to have teeth whitened with milk. On a simplistic level, Yehuda’s being blessed that he will have large flocks of sheep and cattle which will give testimony to the promise of our living in a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<p>However, other mifarshim provide an amazing context. They say, one can see if someone’s eyes are red with wine by looking at them. But, how does one know if someone’s teeth are milk white? They answer, one only sees another’s teeth when that person smiles. This they say is the ultimate symbol of strength and royalty, to be a smiling king. A warm smile, is the attribute of great leaders as well. Effective leaders know that, amazingly, a smile is a language that even a baby understands. And a smile confuses an approaching frown &#8211; it is the curve that sets everything straight. After all, when one smiles at someone, that someone wants to smile back.</p>
<p>It is true that leaders must be strong like a lion and ready to be unyielding in the face of adversity. However, having those attributes without the noble, joyful smile of simcha and respect limits ones leadership and it’s potential to make a difference. A king, a leader must be confident in who he is and project the happiness and joy that only a smile can bring.</p>
<p>What a powerful lesson for us all. Whether we are acting as king of our castle or leading others (willingly or unwittingly) through our example, our effect is dependant on our affect. There is so much joy a smile can bring. And we can kaviyachol bring a smile to His lips by being that model of <em>malchus</em> to each other and the world at large that Yaakov intended.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Yaakov’s Shlomim</h2>
<p>Following the dramatic news of Yosef Hatzaddik’s survival in the flesh pots of Mitzrayim, Yaakov Avinu readies himself to visit his long lost son. With vigor and alacrity he packs his bags. Taking his entire family and all of his possessions in tow he head towards Be’er Sheva. Why Be’er Sheva? Chazal explain, it was years earlier that, “<em>vayeitzei Yaakov miBe’er Sheva</em>,” that Yaakov’s life travail from Lavan to Yosef commenced upon his departure from Beer Sheva. Now that his life had come full circle he went back to Be’er Sheva, to offer thanks to Hashem Yisborach in a <em>makom Tefilah</em> of his fathers, the place where it all began.</p>
<p>Energized with a renewed sense of <em>simchas hachyim,</em> Yaakov Avinu arrives in Be’er Sheva and immediately brings a <em>korban</em> of thanks to the <em>Ribbono Shel Olam</em>. However, unlike all <em>korbanos</em> offered heretofore, from the time of Noach and Avraham until this climactic moment, Yaakov does not bring a <em>korban Olah</em>, which is<em> kulo laHashem</em>. Rather, he offers <em>zevachim</em>, <em>shlomim</em> sacrifices. Offerings which are shared with and enjoyed by all. Interestingly, the Torah records that he offers them to the <em>Elokei</em> <em>Aviv</em> Yitzchok.</p>
<p><em>Mifarshei hamikrah</em> wonder; firstly, why <em>Shlomim</em>? Secondly, why not also mention <em>Elokei</em> Avraham as Yaakov had in the past? And finally, why wouldn’t one <em>korban</em> suffice, he obviously offered many animals (<em>zevachim</em>).<span id="more-4992"></span> One explanation provides us an extraordinary insight to golus in general and Yaakov Avinu’s persuit of <em>shlaimus</em> in particular. Perhaps it is a <em>remez</em> to the recipe for Geula as well.</p>
<p>The Ramban reminds us that Yitzchok Avinu represents <em>middas hadin</em>. He quotes the Midrash which teaches that Yaakov Avinu realized that with his impending descent to Mitzrayim the dreaded <em>golus</em> was about to begin. He feared for himself and his children. The total tragedy and devastation of the terror of golus could only be realized with the <em>middas hadin</em> (represented by Yitzchok Avinu) in full force. As such, Yaakov Avinu offered <em>shlomim</em> to the <em>Elokei Aviv Yitzchok</em>, to somehow sweeten the <em>middas hadin</em> through his offerings and thereby ensure Klal Yisrael’s ultimate survival through the darkness of golus that loomed ahead. Indeed, by being <em>matil shalom b’olam</em> with his <em>shlomim</em> offerings, the <em>middas harachamim</em> would be aroused. With H<em>akadosh Baurch Hu’s rachamim</em> ignited he could descend to Mitzrayim confident in Klal Yisrael’s future.</p>
<p>This was especially important to Yaakov Avinu who recognized that the descent of the <em>shivtei kah</em> to Mitzrayim started with the <em>kinah</em> of the brothers towards Yosef, an attitude that started with their perception of Yaakov’s playing favorite with his “<em>ben zekunim</em>.” Yaakov in his quest for <em>shlaimus</em> wanted a <em>tikkun</em> for this mistake. Thus the <em>tikkun</em> of his <em>shlomim</em> was personal and communal and he needed to offer at least two animals; one for himself and one for the <em>tzibbur</em>. Indeed, having come full circle, Yaakov wanted to be a <em>shaleim</em> thus <em>shalom</em> was priority number one.</p>
<p>This should not be lost upon us. The darkness of <em>golus</em> still engulfs us. We feel its pain in many ways. Yaakov Avinu taught us that he way to be <em>mamtik</em> the bitter days of exile is through multiple <em>shlomim</em>, creating a greater sense of harmony between each Yid and as a result between Klal Yisrael and <em>Avihem Shebashamayim</em>. The more we feel the <em>din</em> the more we need the <em>shlomim</em>. If one senses that klal Yisrael is feeling the pinch of <em>middas hadin</em> today, then Yaakov Avinu’s model should be our inspiration. We should be ambitious in being <em>marbeh shlomim</em> as <em>ohavei</em> and <em>rodfei shalom</em>! Perhaps this is one more reason why Parshas Vayigash is read immediately following the <em>chag</em> of Chanukah. With the<em> chag urim</em> just behind us we should not forget the Rambam’s concluding message of hilchos Chanukah where he states “<em>godol Hashalom shekol haTorah nitna la’asos shalom ba’olam”</em> It is Yaakov Avinu’s message to us as well. The only way to survive the dark days of golus is through being<em> marbeh shalom</em>. Let us do more. We can start today. In that zechus may we merit that the <em>oseh shalom bimromav</em> will be <em>yaaseh shalom aleinu</em> of <em>kol Yisrael bimhara biyameinu</em>, amen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/shamash_drip.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4975" title="shamash_drip" alt="" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/shamash_drip-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>Separation of Church and State is widely regarded as a modern concept. For most of the world this is an accurate assessment. In some places in the world there remains no separation. What I mean by a separation between church and state is that quite simply there are two different and exclusive bodies that legislate religion and politics. Political leadership is vested in one person or group and religious considerations are seen to by a different person or group.</p>
<p>In the United States, I believe separation of church and state is a misnomer. It&#8217;s not that there is a separation as much as the state has no opinion on religion. I think that a truer version of a separation between church and state originated with ancient Judaism.</p>
<p>The law was that the political leadership of the Jewish people flowed through the Davidic family of the tribe of Judah. The religious leaders in ancient Israel were the priests and the Levites who were are members of the tribe of Levi. These two groups were separate. This separation of powers was to ensure that no group had absolute power. It created a balance between political and domestic interests and religious interests. It was a good system and I believe the model for today&#8217;s separation.<span id="more-4974"></span></p>
<p>The story of Chanukah tells the tale of the Hasmonean family rebelling against the oppressive Seleucid-Greeks. This family was a priestly family. They sough to restore honor and holiness to the Temple. They also sought political autonomy from the Seleucid-Greeks.</p>
<p>They won both.</p>
<p>At that moment that they won they should have appointed a Davidic heir to the throne. But they failed to do so. A Hasmonean was anointed king and this began a slow fall from grace for the Hasmoneans. Not one Hasmonean remained after several generations of intermarriage and intra-violence. The Rabbis of the Talmudic era cite their error in taking the throne as the reason for their ultimate colossal failure.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Hasmoneans did not separate church and state. They were the kings and the priests at the same time and carried absolute power. As time has proven time and time again, absolute power corrupts absolutely. The Hasmoneans ended up in the scrap heap of history because of their failure in this regard.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of candles on our Chanukah menorah. There are the candles that we light each light. On the first night we light one and the second night we light two and we continue adding candles for eight night. By lighting these candles we fulfill a religious obligation to light these candles as instituted by the great rabbis of the Mishnah. We light candles and create holiness.</p>
<p>However there is another candle. The shamash is the candle we use to light the nightly candles. It does not factor into the religious nightly lighting. It is a functional candle, not a holy candle. It is a candle whose name, shamash can mean &#8220;caretaker&#8221;. The shamash is the lighter. But it is not the candle of the mitzvah.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the requirement that we use a shamash was a wink from the rabbis of the Mishnah reminding us why the Hasmoneans were such a disaster. They did not separate the political from the religious. The functional and holy were too closely intertwined. The political leaders were from the same family as the religious leaders.</p>
<p>Chanukah remembers their initial success but the lighting of the Chanukah candles reminds us of their ultimate failure. They did not separate church and state. On our Chanukah menorah we do separate church and state. We light holy candles to do a mitzvah. We light those candles with a separate, purely functional candle.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not quite sure how to relate this idea to contemporary Chanukah celebrations and the current state of Jewish affairs. But I am pretty sure there is a message in there that reminds us that sometimes we and our leaders need to hear alternative voices. That a <em>kinas sofrim</em> among Jews is a good thing and helps us fine tune our personal observance. There cannot be just one way, with one leadership, with one set of ideas. There must be multiple voices. There can&#8217;t be absolute power because is absolutely corrupts. Just ask as the shamash.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayeshev<br />
Barasy Yetzer Hara, Barasy Torah Tavlin</h2>
<p>One of the many interesting story lines of Yosef Hatzadik’s experience of Parshas Vayeshev deals with his life as the chief of staff of Potifar. Yosef is appointed to be in charge of all of Potifar’s affairs and then we are told that Yosef was <em>yifei toar v’fei mareh</em>. The very next pasuk (39:7) tells us that all of the sudden the wife of Potifar set her sight to prey upon Yosef and place before him the ultimate test of his morality. Rashi presents the words of Chazal that teaches us that since Yosef was left in charge of Potifar’s estate he let it get to his head. He began to eat and drink and became preoccupied with his appearance. Thus, Hashem sent <em>eishes</em> Potifar to test him and remind him not to be haughty. Indeed soon there after, Yosef ended up back in prison.</p>
<p>The Netziv adds a vital insight to this lesson.<span id="more-4946"></span> The Natziv explains that typically a ben Torah can expect that the Torah will provide them some level of spiritual protection from the elements around them. The Torah, in telling us that Yosef was <em>yefei toa</em>r and <em>yfei mareh</em> is letting us know that the reason the Torah did not protect Yosef was because he wasn’t studying it enough. He wasn’t learning and as such there was no strength of Torah to protect him from nisayon. This lesson is critical.</p>
<p>Society at large can place many <em>nisyonos</em> from issues of morality, financial integrity, arrogance and pride. The Torah will only serve as a shield and protect us if we study it with intensity, consistency, passion and fervor. Baruch Hashem Yosef was able to pass the test, and as we learn later he went back to his learning. Those who don’t have Yosef’s strength of character should be reminded should be reminded to not get distracted in the priority of<em> talmid Torah kineged kulam</em>, whether at work and even in the bais medresh. Not only is the Torah the <em>tavlin</em> but it is the force field of protection which helps keep us safe from harm.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Toldos<br />
A Total Education</h2>
<p>The beginning of Parshas Toldos reintroduces us to the birth of Yitzchak Avinu as it begins to detail his legacy as a second of our avos. The Parsha begins <em>v’eileh toldos Yitzchok ben Avraham, Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em>. The commentaries wonder what the second half of this pasuk is teaching us since the verse already explained that Avraham was Yitzchok’s father. Rashi quotes the chazal which tells us that <em>Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em> is placed in the verse to teach us that Yitzchok looked exactly like his father and anyone who saw him knew that Avraham holid es Yitzchok, only Avraham can be his father (and not Avimelech, as the cynics of the generation had posited).</p>
<p>The Ibn Ezra takes a different approach. He explains the declaration that <em>Avraham holid es Yizchok</em> is referring to Yitzchok’s chinuch. Having fathered Yishmael, Avraham Avinu knew full well what it was like to have a child at risk. This time he took no chances. Not only did Avraham father Yitzchok but he also reared him to follow his teachings!<span id="more-4879"></span></p>
<p>In the nature versus nurture debate Avraham had discovered that both our needed. He thus faithfully transmitted all his values and priorities to Yitzchok his son. In every way Yitzchok was the physical and spiritual heir to Avraham Avinu. Similarly we are taught <em>kol milamid ben chaveiro kielu yaldo</em>. From the moment he was born, education, Yitzchok’s chinuch was Avraham Avinu’s full time preoccupation. He put all his <em>kochos leholid Yitzchok</em>, to guide, inspire and direct him on the path of greatness. And, with <em>siata dishmaya</em> he was blessed with success.</p>
<p>If we reflect back on nuances of the previous parsha leading up to and following Yitzchok’s birth we can mine some vital gems of chinuch priorities we can apply today. The Meforshim wonder what is the linkage between the destruction of Sedom and the <em>besurah tova</em> to Avraham and Sara that they will be blessed with a son? The three malachim traveled together, obviously there was a connection to their individual missions. Some explain first and foremost that Sedom had to be destroyed before Yitzchok could be born. There would be no way to rear a Yitzchok to the status of a <em>korban olah</em> with a Sedom in the environs. Thus when the malachim told Sara she would have a son they immediately set out to destroy that which could corrupt and derail all that Yitzchok could grow to be.</p>
<p>Avraham and Sarah understood this message and when the time came they exiled Yishmael from their home. A painful choice that with Hakadosh Baruch Hu’s blessing cleared the environment for Yitzchok to thrive. Even with his new beloved son growing up before his eyes, Avraham stuck to his own mission of outreach in kiruv. <em>Vayeeta eishal b’Vear Sheva</em>, and guest filled his home connecting to Hakadosh Baruch Hu (eishal was the acromyn for achila, shtiya velina). In this manner Yitzchok learned his <em>achrayus</em> to the klal and the need to spread the reality of Hashem Yisborach to a lost and pagan world.</p>
<p>Finally, after the <em>akaida</em> (22:19) Ibn Ezra wonders why the pasuk says vayashav Avraham el niarav, it seems that Avraham alone returned. Where was Yitzchok? The Ibn Ezra explains that following the <em>akaida</em>, the climactic moment of <em>gelui shchina</em> and <em>mesiras nefesh</em> when he was almost shechted, Yitzchok reached a tremendous <em>madraiga</em>. Avraham wanted to capitalize on the energy of the moment and therefore sent him to learn in the Yeshiva of Shem V’ever so that he could build on his inspiration and through <em>limud haTorah</em> to soar to even greater heights that would remain with him long after the inspiration had waned. <em>Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em>. He directed every aspect of his total development, <em>b’gashmius, b’ruchniyus, b’middos, b’mitzvos, b’yiras shamayim ub’limud haTorah</em>.</p>
<p>This message should never be lost upon us. Chinuch must be the full time preoccupation especially in our challenging environment where the elimination of the Sedom’s of our world are simply impossible. As such, we must be even more careful in providing balance between removing corrupting influences from our home (Yishmael) and providing healthy opportunities to see others not committed to our values but who we confidently bring under our sphere of influence without the fear that we will be corrupted by them. As careful as Avraham was with the chinuch of Yitzchok, he did not put his head in the sand nor completely isolate him from the world at large. Finally, we must show our children that Talmud Torah is <em>kineged kulam</em>. It is not enough to be inspired but we must live inspired. Therefore at the moments of great spiritual peeks we must look towards our learning to be the glue that enables us to hold onto that moment and maximize its impact each and every day.</p>
<p>Like Avraham we cannot have a <em>hesech hadaas</em> from the chinuch of our children. We can learn from him. Iy”H as our children grow it will be said of each of us that we were holid each of our offspring.</p>

<h2>Parshas Chayei Sara<br />
Ever Thankful</h2>
<p>One can help but be amazed by the amazing lessons for life taught to us by our avos and recorded for posterity as a <em>limud</em> for us throughout Sefer Bereishis. One phenomenal lesson is taught and reinforced again in Parshas Chaya Sara.</p>
<p>As Avraham laden with grief upon the passage of his beloved wife, Sarah Imanu, heads to Chevron to purchase to secure a burial place for Sarah Imanu. Filled with grief he approaches Bnei Cheis seeking to purchase the Mearas Hamachpayla. He explains his plight and the Bnei Cheis say to him, do not worry no one here will hold back in providing you a burial plot for your deceased. Efron too, the leader of the Bnei Cheis tells him<em> hasadeh nasatee</em> <em>lach</em>, the plot is yours<em>…k’vor meisecha</em>. Avraham’s response to their words and seeming benevolence is (23:12) <em>vayishtachu Avraham lifnei am haaretz</em>, Avraham bowed to the people.</p>
<p>The Medrish Raba uses this episode to teach a halacha and says <em>mikan lomdim shemodim al besurah tova</em>-we are supposed to give thanks on hearing good tidings. Interestingly, Avraham had not yet finished negotiating with Efron nor had he yet aquired the Mearas Hamachpayla still the very fact that he heard they were receptive to his idea was enough for him to bow and give thanks. Avraham was so conscious of expressing appreciation for everything that transpired that even in his grief while still an <em>onain</em> he stopped and gave thanks with the optimistic belief that things were going to work out.</p>
<p>This notion is so vital to the lessons of Parshas Chayei Sara that it is repeated again to let us know how crucial this attitude is to our outlook.<span id="more-4850"></span> Later on in the parsha we learn of Eliezer <em>eved</em> Avraham’s search for a wife for Yitzchok. He offers a tefilah to Hashem and asks that a test of a maiden giving him and his camels water be a siman min hashamayim of the perfect match for Yitzchok. Immediately upon concluding his supplication the famous story of Rivka at the well unfolds. After she finished watering his camels, Eliezer asks her- “who is your father?”, Rivka responds that she is the daughter of Besuel and she invites him to her father’s home. The Torah then declares, <em>vayikod haish vayishtachavu l’Hashem</em>. Eliezer bowed down to express appreciation to Hakadosh Baruch Hu for seeing his prayers beginning to be answered. On this pasuk the Medrish also says <em>mikan shemodim al besura tova</em>. Though similar to the story of Avraham and Bnei Cheis there are some slight differences which we must learn from. By Avraham Avinu it says not that he bowed to Hashem, just that he bowed. Eliezer on the other hand the Torah specifies he bowed to Hakadosh Baruch Hu. The underling message is powerful. Hodaah is due to people and to Hashem Yisborach for all the good that takes place in our life…even the good things that have not yet happened!</p>
<p>Moreover, there is never a moment in time when expressing <em>hodaah</em> should be difficult. Avraham needed to bury Sarah-he was in mourning, but he found the time to be grateful. Eliezer in a foreign country with a mission to hastly accomplish took the time to be grateful. He wasn’t in too much of a hurry to say thanks to Hashem Yisbarach for putting him in the right place at the right time. In addition, we must also explore the context of these declarations of hodaah. Avraham Avinu took the time to express appreciation at the end of Sarah sojourn on this earth as he himself too entered his twilight years having been blessed bakol. Eliezer on the other hand expresses hodaah at the prospect of having found a wife for Yitzchok who would now be able to begin living his life <em>beshleimus</em> with his <em>bashert</em> Rivka Imanu. It is never too early and never too late to be thankful.</p>
<p>These lessons should not be lost upon us. So many of us feel the pain of loss and bereft of comfort from recent tragedies that have plagued our people. Nevertheless, we must reach down deep beyond our suffering and follow the example of Avraham Avinu. We must find our way to look beyond the pain and tragedy and be thankful for even a <em>besura tova</em>, a seemingly little thing that has not yet come to fruition, even the grief is still fresh upon us. In that zechus of finding the way to be maker tov to the Ribono Shel Olam like Avraham <em>beshaas evel</em>, may we be <em>zoche</em> to have the opportunity to be maker tov to Hakadosh Baruch Hu like Eliezer eved Avraham, out of simcha and joy of <em>kol sasson vekol simcha kal chason vekol kallah kol omrim hodu es Hashem…ki leolam chasdo</em>.</p>

<h2>Parsha Vayeira<br />
Elokim Imcha</h2>
<p>Nestled within the many lessons of Parshas Vayera is an amazing insight into the nature of the relationship between Hakadosh Baruch Hu and klal Yisrael. It is a yesod which should inspire us. It is a lesson which emanates from the second interaction between Avimelech Melech Plishtim and Avraham Avinu. Let us investigate.</p>
<p>Subsequent to Avraham Avinu’s departure from the land of the Plishtim, he once again encounters Avimelech and Phichol his chief of staff who wish to make a treaty with him. They justify their pursuit of this pact with Avraham Avinu by declaring (21:22)<em> Elokim imcha bechol asher ata oseh</em>. Seemingly, this means that they noted in Avraham Avinu that he was blessed with siyata deShmaya and that Hakadosh Baruch Hu was with him in all his endeavors. This of course was true. Avraham Avinu had survived the kivshon ha’esh, defeated Nimrod/Amrafel, emerged unscathed from Sedom, had amassed incredible wealth and now, in his old age, he and Sarah Imeinu were blessed with a son, Yitzchok.</p>
<p>Indeed, Avraham Avinu was blessed with a tremendous amount of siyata deShmaya and was recognized as the n’see Elokim wherever he went. Avimelech, Melech Plishtim, wanted to tap in to that success that was reflected in the life and accomplishments of Avraham Avinu. Sure enough, with singing of their treaty, Avraham Avinu spent yamim rabim (21:34) in the environs of Eretz Plishtim generating success for not only himself, but, for Avimelech and his countrymen.</p>
<p>The Malbim however places a slightly different spin in understanding Avimelech’s perspective and what motivated him to seek this accord with Avraham Avinu.<span id="more-4827"></span> According to the Malbim, it was not merely that Avimelech viewed Avraham Avinu as one who was blessed with incredible siyata dishmaya who lived a G-dly, spiritual life, rather Avimelech saw “<em>Elokim imcha bechol asher ata oseh</em>” &#8211; <em>ratza lomar she’ain maasecha nimshachim el gezaras haElokim</em>, it is not that you, Avraham, are following the decrees of Hashem, <em>rak ritzono haElokim nimshach achar maasecha</em>, rather, Hashem’s decrees are based on your actions. In other words, Avimelech was able to detect that not only did Avraham do Hashem’s will, but Hashem did Avraham’s will, too! What an observation.</p>
<p>This yisod is more than just an application of the concept of <em>tsadik gozer veHaksadosh Baruch Hu mikayim</em>. Rather, it reflects the power imbued to us to be able to, kaviyachol direct G-d’s will through our actions! Amazingly, we are empowered by the choices we make to influence the ratzon Hashem. It is a privilege and a power not to be taken lightly.  What a gift, what an opportunity and what a responsibility. Hashem Yisborach trusts us to make the correct decision. He gives us the tools and then lets us decide. When we choose well we are not only blessed with siyata diShmaya but we can climb the ladder of aliya ruchanis to reach the madreiga where the ratzon HaElokim will be, <em>nimshach achar maasenu</em>, and ultimately be determined by us!</p>
<p><em>Merubim tzarchei amcha</em>, with Klal Yisrael needing so much let us not have <em>daas ketzara</em>. Rather, let us be aware that we can “inspire” the Melech Malchei Hamlachim to do our will if we but, <em>asei ritzoneinu kirtzono</em>. We, too, can follow the example of Avraham Avinu and influence, through our actions, the ratzon Hashem to answer our prayers and bring the ultimate geulah to a rapid reality. The power in is on our hands.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stack_of_gold_coins.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4785" title="stack_of_gold_coins" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stack_of_gold_coins-300x227.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="227" /></a>The Torah tells us (14:12) that some time after Lot left Avram’s home Lot was captured by the warring kings. They took Lot all his possessions and then they left Sodom.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lot began this week’s Torah portion as a righteous person. He stayed with Avram even as Avram left his homeland. Lot remained at Avram’s side even as Avram made a dangerous trip to Egypt. Avram even considers Lot a brother as he says (13:18) “we are like brothers”. They like brothers – not in blood, rather in righteousness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Yet, somewhere along the way, Lot got lost. He deviated from the path that was set forth by Avram and the path upon which he had accompanied Avram for all those years. The verse tells us (13:14) that “GD spoke to Avram after Lot parted company from him” and the Medrash Tanchuma explains that GD waited until Lot left the presence of Avram to speak with Avram. In the words of the Medrash: “GD did not want to speak Avram so long as the ‘wicked’ Lot was with Avram”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rav Schwab wonders what happened to Lot? He started on the right path. He was Avram’s “brother”. How did he become someone the Medrash describes as wicked?<span id="more-4784"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rav Schwab suggests that the above quoted verse hints at the answer. &#8220;And they took Lot and his possessions, the nephew of Avram&#8221;. The clause that separates Lot from Avram is “his possessions”. And that is exactly what separated Lot from Avram – his possessions. Lot’s money and his approach to material wealth separated him from Avram physically and spiritually.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When presented with the opportunity to stay with Avram or choose a new life, Lot chose to pursue a new life of materialism. Lot chose the area in ancient Israel that valued money above all else. Lot’s desire for wealth and status bumped him off the path of Avram.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Avram was a wealthy man, but his choices were still guided by morality. Lot made wealth his priority and morality was secondary.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In our lives, there are many times when we are given a choice between what will enrich us spiritually and what will enrich us materially. We hope that we can follow the path of Avram and choose life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have so many opportunities to be generous, to give to others, to help out and be like our great grandfather Avram. We cannot allow things like status or money come between us the way it came between Avram and Lot. If we are successful, we will have created the kind of environment that spawned a Yitzchak, Yaakov and nation of Israel and we will see the same kind of result in our homes and communities.</p>

<h2>Parshas Lech Lecha<br />
It’s All a Gift</h2>
<p>In Parshas Lech Lecha we are told how Avraham Avinu is taken outside by the Ribbono Shel Olam and told to look towards the heavens and count the stars. He is then blessed, <em>ko yiheye zarecha </em>that his offspring (we, <em>bnei Yisrael</em>) will be like the stars and the heaven. The next <em>posuk</em> tells us <em>v’heemin baHashem</em>, that Avraham believed in Hakadosh Baruch Hu, <em>vayachshiveha lo tzedaka</em> and he considered it a <em>tzekada</em>. Miforshim wonder and debate about whom this phrase is discussing. Was it Avraham who considered it a <em>chessed</em> of Hashem to be promised offspring who would be like the stars or was is it Hakadosh Baruch Hu who found it an act of <em>tzeddek</em> &#8211; righteousness on behalf of Avraham Avinu who was heemin baHashem, a believer that Hakadosh Baruch Hu would keep His promise of children, grandchildren and generations of Yiddin who would illuminate the world like the “stars of the heaven.”</p>
<p>Rashi explains that it was Hakadosh Baruch Hu that thought it was exceptional that Avraham believed him even though he had not yet fathered a child. The Ramban however takes the opposite view and says that Avraham considered it a kindness, an act of tzedaka by the Ribbono Shel Olam, to even consider promising him a child and a family. In his modesty he felt himself perhaps unworthy of such a <em>chessed</em>. True he had followed Hashem Yisborach’s instructions to leave his home town and travel to Eretz Yisrael and he had done whatever Hakadosh Baruch Hu had expected of him. Nevertheless, to Avraham Avinu, nothing was a given. It was all a gift.<span id="more-4778"></span></p>
<p>This <em>yesod</em> should not be lost upon us. When we stop and think, we too, can come to realize that nothing is a given. It is all a gift.</p>
<p>The blessings of family, success and good fortune are not something we deserve, even if we think we’ve earned them. We must be ever cognizant of the fact that Hashem Yisboach owes us nothing and we owe Him everything. So much of the petty pain and suffering people inflict upon each other is due to forgetting this point. We expect things to go our way, we expect a certain amount of respect. We expect to be valued and not to be taken for granted. We even expect that things will be easy and that our life will be filled with comfort and calm. We expect it all. Indeed, we are filled with great expectations.</p>
<p>We pray for <em>bracha</em>. Often times, those prayers are answered. But, lest we forget where all goodness comes from, Avraham Avinu reminds us, says the Ramban, to step back and remember, it is all a gift and we should appreciate it. As such, we should be extra careful to always be thankful and appreciative of what Hashem Yisborach has sent our way. We can and should show that gratitude in so many ways through our <em>limud</em> haTorah, <em>kiyum hamitzvos</em>, <em>iyun tefilah</em>, giving of <em>tzedakah</em> and <em>ridifas</em> <em>hachessed </em>as we always remember,  nothing is a given, it is all a gift!</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Nitzavim Vayeilech<br />
Not a Jealous Bone</h2>
<p>As Sefer Devarim draws to a close Moshe Rabbeinu delivers his last words and testament to the Jewish people. As he approaches his final day, we cannot help but wonder what was going through Moshe Rabbeinu’s mind the last day of his life. One yesod is so poignant it must be repeated.</p>
<p>The Midrash Rabba in Parshas Vayeleich articulates how Moshe Rabeinu greatly desired to prolong and stave off his ultimate appointment with the Malach Hamaves. He busied himself with tzarchei tsibur, wrote twelve sifrei Torah and deflected the Malach Hamaves in his mission. In a way, he was burning with confidence that perhaps the gezayra of his demise would be annulled. Staying busy on behalf of the Klal and teaching Torah would surely keep the dreaded shlucho shel makom at bay. And it did. With the Malach Hamaves repulsed by Moshe Rabeinu’s limud haTorah, Hakadosh Baruch Hu so to speak had to employ an alternative strategy to bring Moshe Rabeinu’s neshama back home. In fact the Ribbono Shel Olam, Kaviyachol, took the mission upon Himself.<span id="more-4664"></span></p>
<p>Instead of the Malach Hamaves taking Moshe Rabeinu’s neshama, Hashem Yisborach, seemingly, listened to Moshe Rabeinu’s request for continued life even if he would no longer be the teacher of Am Yisrael. At Moshe’s behest, He had Moshe switch roles with his devoted talmid Yehoshua. Together Yehoshua on the right, and Moshe on the left, signifying Yehoshua’s new leadership for klal Yisrael, they approached the Ohel Moed. They entered inside and the anan of the Shechina descended over Yehoshua in his first communion with the Ribono Shel Olam as the newly appointed melamed Torah le’amo Yisrael.</p>
<p>After the Shechina departed, Moshe turned to Yehoshua, his faithful student, and asked him – “what did Hakadosh Baruch Hu tell you?” Yehoshua responded “when the Shechina was upon you was I given permission to know what Hashem spoke to you? I too cannot reveal what it was that Hashem said to me.” At that very moment explains the Midrash, tza’ak Moshe ve’amar, meiah misos v’lo kina achas &#8211; I would rather one hundred deaths than even one moment of jealousy! And he immediately submitted himself to the gezeira of his passing. Moshe Rabbeinu did not want to experience even one jealous bone in his body.</p>
<p>What a powerful lesson. Moshe Rabeinu preferred his own demise rather than covet that which belonged to others. The most modest of men would not let that which is motzi es ha’adam min haolam sully his very core. He would leave this world untainted, taken b’nishika and not via the ugly middah of jealousy.</p>
<p>From the sad saga of Kayin and Hevel to the divisive rebellion of Korach, the murder, machlokes and suffering brought about by kina have scarred our people for generations. Ugly competition, vindictive cattiness, painful bullying and hurtful disloyalty to our brothers and sisters is the natural outgrowth of the horrible trait. Indeed, jealousy is a midah which is so pernicious it can quickly and easily creep into our every endeavor. Rather than being victimized by its venomous and corrupting tentacles, we must learn from Moshe Rabbeinu to run from its grasp and prevent it from entering out heart and mind. To do so we must joyfully appreciate each moment Hashem Yisborach has granted us and view all we have been blessed with in this world as a gift emanating from His love!</p>
<p>As we prepare ourselves for the yemei hadin and react to people, events and things in the workplace, conversations at home and our interactions with neighbors we must strive to measure our behavior against the standard of Moshe Rabbeinu who teaches; better a thousand deaths than a moment of jealous envy. We can work to eradicate kina of what we desire of others. In so doing we can merit a year of bracha, nachas and kol tuv as we make ourselves the kaylim for the birchos Hashem which are sure to follow.</p>

</span></p>
<h2>Parshas Ki Savo<br />
Lofty Aspirations</h2>
<p>Following the ghastly klalos of the tochacha Moshe Rabenu reassures Klal Yisrael of their eternity. He inspires them by reminding them of Hakadosh Baruch Hu’s care and concern for us as He took us out of Mitzrayim. He then adds an enigmatic phrase. As Moshe declares in (29:3), “Velo nasan Hashem lachem lev ladaas veanayim leros veaznayim leshmoa ad hayom hazeh”.</p>
<p>Essentially, Moshe declares that until that moment in time Klal Yisrael had not borne witness or confirmed their commitment to Torah and the ability to appreciate the chessed of the Ribono Shel Olam until that very moment.</p>
<p>This is a puzzling refrain. We had said naaseh venishma forty years earlier. Moreover, we had followed the ananei hakavod and the nightly pillar of fire in the midbar for forty years. We had experienced matan Torah, seen wondrous miracles and readied ourselves to enter in Eretz Yisroel. Could it be that only now, just days before Moshe Rabenu’s death that Klal Yisrael was acknowledged for their acceptance of their commitments to Torah, avoda and gemilus chassadim? Is it really true that ad hayom hazeh Klal Yisrael was deficient in their appreciation of Hashem?<span id="more-4618"></span></p>
<p>Rashi too is bothered by this perplexing statement and provides us an insight that is amazing. Rashi teaches us his mesorah, that on that day, Moshe Rabeinu wrote the “official” copy of the Torah. This original text was entrusted to Shevet Levi who were to safeguard it for eternity as it would serve as the original document in which all of the sifrei Torah in the future would be redacted. When klal Yisrael observed that this original Torah was being given to Shevet Levi they complained to Moshe how can you give the Torah only to your shevet, it is a morasha to us too? When Moshe Rabbeinu heard that klal Yisrael was complaining that somebody else was receiving the Torah he rejoiced and said “now I realize that you truly desire to serve Hashem”.</p>
<p>We learn from here a valuable lesson. So much of who we are and what defines us is determined by what we aspire for. Even more telling is what makes us jealous and the things we covet in others. When klal Yisrael coveted Torah, Moshe Rabeinu knew that’s what defined us.</p>
<p>The same is true with us today. If all we seek is wealth, fame and fortune then that defines what we are. But if our drive and commitment is for Torah and mitzvos, if in fact we want to grow and become even closer to Hakadosh Baruch Hu then that defines us too.</p>
<p>Yehi ratzon that we be blessed sheyimalei mishalos lebaynu letova as we want the right things and they become us, as we become them for a year filled with health, happiness and joy.</p>

<h2>Parshas Ki Seitzei<br />
Honesty Counts</h2>
<p>Parshas Ki Seitzei is jam packed with mitzvos. Interestingly, it concludes with two seemingly unrelated mitzvos, the halachos of honest weights and measures and the requirement to remember what Amalek did to us when he attacked us following our geula from Mitzrayim. The smichos haparshiyos leaves a powerful reminder.</p>
<p>Chazal point out the obvious relationship between these two mitzvos. Simply, when yidden are honest Amalek has no shlitah. Honesty is always reflection for our bitachon in haKadosh Baruch Hu. Amalek only attacks when we are ayaf veyagaya velo yarey Elokim. As such, maintaining integrity in our business affairs is crucial. As it not only reflects our emuna, but it is the best preventive medicine we can employ to keep Amalek away.</p>
<p>But there is more.<span id="more-4589"></span> The pasuk expands the description of the unscrupulous business man and calls kol osei avel, all those who behave badly as deserving of the same consequences as those who are dishonest. In fact, the Sifrei darshans that these people are defined with five uncomplimentary terms; avel, sanui, meshukatz, cheirem and toeiva. These are very powerful words characterizing those who take advantage of others for personal gain. The implication is self explanatory. Those who wish not to be called a toeiva should exercise caution and propriety to be able to answer the question of nasasa venatata beemuna positively.</p>
<p>The Malbim takes it a step further. He understands these five descriptors from avel to toeiva as a progression. One leads to the other. When an individual has a breakdown in his business ethics, then he is more than at risk for having a breakdown in other areas of his mitzvah observance. He is on the fast track to “toeiva-hood”, being an abomination in the eyes of Hashem for all sorts of disgusting behavior. Cheating can lead even to murder once the breakdown in ethical behavior begins.</p>
<p>This message need not be lost during the month of Elul. Small failures in ethical behavior create large chasms of spiritual deficit.</p>
<p>The opposite is also true. Working on our integrity we can help shut down the access to all that is evil and make it easier to refine our character in avodas Hashem. This idea is part of what we remember when we are mekayem the mitzvah of zachor es asher asa lecha Amalek. It is why it is one of the shesh zichronos. We not only remember what Amalek did, but we remind ourselves of what invites his behavior.</p>
<p>May we be zoche to be inspired so that our ethical conduct is always above reproach. Leman yareechun yamecha and be blessed with the areechas yamim that the Torah promises to all those who are honest.</p>

<h2>Parshas Shoftim<br />
Tamim Tehiyeh</h2>
<p>As Moshe Rabbeinu continues his admonition of Klal Yisrael we are reminded once again of the powerful legacy and commitments of our people. Indeed our connection to the past is the guarantee for our future. And so Moshe Rabbeinu invokes the call put forth to Avraham Avinu who was told by the Ribbono Shel Olam <em>his&#8217;haleich lifanai v’heyei tamim</em> &#8211; walk with Hashem and be pure of faith. As Moshe Rabbeinu continues his epitaph he challenges us to ascend that same mountain of emunah like our patriarch by declaring <em>tamim tehiyeh im Hashem Elokecha -</em> be pure in your faith of Hashem. As we know, Avraham Avinu heeded that call and so can we. In fact, as we will soon see, our relationship with Hashem Yisborach and all of His blessing depends on it.</p>
<p>Almost all the mifarshei hamikrah lend their hand at helping us derive a sense of clarity to this command which the Ramban clearly elucidate as a mitzvas asei.<span id="more-4566"></span> Rashi points out simply that we are to walk with Hashem b’temminus. Our relationship with Hakadosh Baruch Hu should be unassuming &#8211; after all, He knows best. Moreover says Rashi we should be mitzapeh lo – we should be seeking Him (and not others) for guidance, hope and salvation. And finally Rashi explains Moshe Rabbeinu’s challenge to mean, kol mahsheyavo alecha kabel b’temmimums – that we must accept Hashem Yisborach as the ultimate master of our destiny. As such, whatever befalls us we should accept with a pure heart. Only then will we be amo his people and chelko His portion. According to Rashi our national destiny, living as His people, is linked to the fulfillment of this mitzvah. We are expected to place our full faith and trust in Him.</p>
<p>Recently, Klal Yisrael has experienced numerous tragedies, dangers, as well as, a conglomerate of “natural disasters” ranging from earthquakes to hurricanes. These traumas have shaken us to our very core. Some have attempted to justify or determine a quid pro quo for the cause of these events by asserting opinions as to why Hashem Yisbarach has done what he did (as if mortal man could know). This is a dangerous practice and one which is completely contrary to the admonition of Moshe Rabainu, tammim tehiyeh im Hashem Elokecha, as explained by Rashi above. Instead of trying to guess what and why Hashem Yisborach is doing, we should just place our trust in Him and be confident that He knows best.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Ramban adds another nuance to our understanding of this critical mitzvas asei. He explains that we must acknowledge and accept that EVERYTHING, all the patterns of nature and the power of our own creativity, indeed the entire world and our future destiny is in His hands. Ki hu Elokai haElokim elyon al hakol. But there is a caveat. While it is true that hakol biydei Shamayim, nevertheless, <em>kol haba’os tehiyenah kifi hiskareiv Eilav</em>! All that will transpire is a direct reflection of the closeness of our relationship with Him, the Ribbono Shel Olam. Yes, all is the Yad Hashem &#8211; but what that Yad delivers, is up to us. The only quid pro quo regarding Hashem Yisborach’s hashgacha and what happens in the world around us is related to our personal connection with Kaviyachol the Ribbono Shel Olam. <em>U’lifichach achar ha’azharos ha’eilu amer sheyehe tamim im Hashem</em>! Indeed, the more deeply and purely (like a seh tamim) that we connect and relate to Him, give ourselves up to Him, make his mitzvos more real, His Torah more vivid and His relationship with us more personal, the more we can count on feeling more of His closeness to us.</p>
<p>Hishaleich lifanei v’hetei Tamim, the past is behind us and our future is ahead, but the present is now!</p>
<p>Tamim tehiyeh im Hashem Elokecha. This mitzvah always accompanies the beginning of chodesh Elul, the month of ani lidodi vdodi li. They go hand in hand. We know that if we turn our hearts to Kaviyachol He will turn His heart to us. Chazal remind us, <em>dirshu Hashem bihamatzo</em>. The <em>yemei ratzon</em> have arrived. As we hearken to the shofar and prepare ourselves for the <em>Yemei Hadin</em> let us remember that so much of what will be is up to us as individuals and as a klal. Let us resolve to maximize the potential of this Mitzvah and strive to walk with Hashem Yisborach <em>b&#8217;temimus</em> as Avraham Avinu did. We question not the past and we dare not predict the future. Rather,we steadfastly commit ourselves to serve Him with our entire being right here, right now.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we serve Hakadosh Baruch Hu, b&#8217;temimus, in the present for an entire Elul, Iy”H we will merit as a result a year filled with bracha and hatzlacha <em>sheyimaleh kol mishakos libeinu litova</em>.</p>

<h2>Parshas Pinchas<br />
Yismach Yisrael!</h2>
<p>The Baal HaTurim on Chumash is famous for his gematrious and relational analysis to common phrases and words in the Torah. In addition, he often adds subtle nuances of insight and observation which illuminate our perspective on poignant issues of hanhaga and hashkafa. These cannot be overlooked. One such subtlety is found at the beginning of this week’s parsha. It’s message is especially poignant in light of current events which have shaken the very core of the Jewish community.</p>
<p>The third posuk of the parsha details how in light of Pinchos’ act of kanaous, Hashem Yisborach declares, Hinini noseion lo es brisi Shalom.<span id="more-4440"></span> The letter vav in the word shalom is written with a break in its vertical length. It is ironic that the word which represents a sense of shalem, wholesomeness, is itself split and divided. Why? Chazal and the miforshei hamikrah offer many insights into this unusual requirement for the writing of the word Shalom in the parsha. One of the insights taught by the Baal Haturim points out that the split vav is the reward of the bris shalom given to Pinchos. It is related to the fact the Pinchos is indeed Eliyahu Hanavi, who will be mevaser the geula b’karov. What is the connection? The Baal Haturim continues to explain that the letter vav was taken from Eliyahu (Pinchos) (heini anochi sholeach lachem es Eliya Hanavi) by Yaakov Avinu. It was added to his own name (v’zacharti es brisi Yaakov, hinini shav shvus ahalei Yaakov written malei with a vav) as a mashkon to secure the arrival of Mashiach. Yaakov Avinu will only return it when Eliyahu Hanavi finally delivers Mashiach to Bnai Yisrael, b’karov.</p>
<p>This quixotic insight is fascinating enough but then the Baal Haturim adds a nuance. He says that this concept is the essence of yagel Yaakov and yismach Yisrael. Why? Yismach shares the exact same letters as the word moshiach. Furthermore, the word Shalom and the phrase zehu Moshiach have the same gematria. Clearly the Baal Haturim is sharing with us a deep concept relating simcha to our ultimate tachlis. Indeed, there is a profound relationship between simcha and our achieving the spiritual nirvana which moshiach will bring. The totality of shalom, true peace, an inner sense of spiritual accomplishment, satisfaction and tranquility, can only come about when we are being oveid Hashem, haMelech she’hashlom shelo, b’Simcha. Without it there is a divide in the shelamos we seek to accomplish. Though seemingly small this break creates a giant chasm separating us from our goal of shelamus, perfection. And at its worst, it wreaks havoc upon us, tachas asher lo avadita es Hashem Elokecha b’isimcha, as it fosters our national devastation.</p>
<p>Despite the sadness of current events and the impending seasonal sorrow of the three weeks we can resolve to help put the vav in the Bris Shalom back together. We must. The formula is the same.</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>Yismach Yisrael! Indeed, to reconnect the two halves of this vav, we must learn to be happy and relish the gift of goodness the Eibeshter showers upon us each day. That is the message of the baal haTurim. From the gift of family, health and to life itself, we certainly cannot take any of them for granted. Every moment of life, whether we are merely eight years or one hundred years old is to be treasured. How sadly we have witnessed that, instantaneously, it all can change. One broken vav can destroy a life and tear apart a family as it traumatizes a community. Being thankful to Him, feeling privilege to be doing His will and feeling excited for the opportunities He provides is one way to heal and reunite that vav. Look back over the past few days and see how a community united made that vav complete. Somehow we had a glimpse of a Moshiach moment as saw beyond that what divides us and reconnected to each other through and with a common mission and united sense of purpose. Find the joy in that unity. It is the reaction He is (kaviyachol) yearning for and it is a balm that we can use to wipe away our bitter tears.</p>
<p>Retain the images of a sea of humanity joined in unison. Kish echad blev echad. Consider always, that Hashem Yisborach took the time, so to speak, to consider us and fashion each individual and their unique combination of talent, personality and character, then we can surlely feel glad for the gift of life and hopefully use it well.</p>
<p>Through achdus we can connect and correct the Simcha quotient in our avodas Hashem. By so doing, we can repair the fractured vav of Shalom we so desperately need. It is our challenge and opportunity. Yismach Yisrael even when the sun is behind the darkest of clouds – Moshiach awaits us!</p>

<h2>Parshas Bamidbar<br />
S’ooh Es Rosh</h2>
<p>Parshas Bamidar is read annually the weeks preceding Shavuos. Chazal deemed its lesson a vital prerequisite to Kabbalas Hatorah always. One important message is found at the beginning of the Sedra. The parsha begins with Hashem Yisborach commanding Moshe Rabbeinu and his brother Aharon Hakohein to count Klal Yisrael. Rashi quotes the Midrash which says that <em>“mitoch chibasan lifanav moneh osam” </em>“due to Hashem Yisborach’s love for us He counts us all the time”. This concept is inspiring. It reminds us that we are not only exhorted to love Hashem, but that He treasures each of us. He loves us back! Indeed, it was this Ahava that was cemented at Matan Torah. Hashem then designated us as the Ohr Laamim, beacons of the Shechina, enlightening the entire world.<span id="more-4281"></span></p>
<p>The Midrashim point out that the command to count Klal Yisrael is introduced with the word, <em>“s’ooh”</em> &#8211; which means to lift up or elevate. Indeed, the word <em>s’ooh</em> shares a common root with the word <em>nasi</em>- prince. It reflects nobility, a royalty born of our potential to grow from the average to the league of elite! Moshe Rabbeinu was told, “<em>amar Hakadosh Baruch Hu – Moshe, kol mah she’ata yochol l’romeim es hauma hazu – rommimah!”</em> (psikta Rabsi perek 10) <em>All that you can do to elevate Klal Yisroel, put into action</em>! That is the essence of leadership. <em>S’ooh es rosh</em> &#8211; our leaders do not merely count us with the intention of realizing a census. Rather, they raise us up, uplift each of our souls and inspire us toward our potential.</p>
<p>This is a powerful message of leadership and love which we can apply to our own family and friends. Each of us finds him or herself in a leadership role quite often. These are opportunities for <em>s’ooh es rosh</em>, to bring out the best in others. At home, too, as leaders of a household, we extol the love we have for our children. In so doing, we mustn’t only look back at the gifts of nachas they have brought us, but we must lift them up and inspire them for the future. We can let our young children know that we see and appreciate the regal attributes which make them each unique. Children so loved will then be equipped to be mikablei Torah, confident of the mission they alone can achieve.</p>
