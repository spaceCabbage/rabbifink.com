				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.559378" target="_blank">The purists insist</a> that Chanukah is a holiday that celebrates a victory against assimilation. They find this ironic because Chanukah is celebrated by so many assimilated Jews who don’t even realize that they are celebrating a holiday about winning a war against their spiritual ancestors. <a href="http://haaretz.com/jewish-world/rabbis-round-table/.premium-1.560152" target="_blank">In Haaretz I argued</a> that this is irrelevant and new meanings to holidays can be perfectly acceptable in Orthodox Judaism and it’s wrong to begrudge our fellows Jews an opportunity to participate in a holiday.</p>
<p>After a bit more thought, I am not so sure that the victory was in fact against assimilation and assimilators per se. The true purpose of the war was to liberate the Temple and re-establish autonomy so that the Jewish people could practice their God-given religion unfettered.<span id="more-7903"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1298383772_11-e1385626617988.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7904" alt="1298383772_11" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1298383772_11-e1385626617988-600x475.jpg" /></a>The Syrian-Greek occupiers made laws that prevented Jewish people from following the word of God. Many people willingly gave up their Judaism and integrated into the foreign culture. These people completely assimilated our of fear.</p>
<p>The Maccabees and their followers were religious zealots who knew that if the Syrian-Greeks were not pushed out of the land, Judaism would have been lost. The lives of those who were living by the Torah were at risk. Whoever disobeyed the prohibitions against Judaism was to be killed. At one point, the Maccabees were threatened with death. It was then that Matisyahu was filled with the passion to wage a war for the sake of their religious beliefs. They took upon themselves the responsibility to evict the Syrian-Greeks from the Temple and to restore their religious freedom.</p>
<p>That is what the war was about. It’s true that when the Maccabees conquered areas within the Land of Israel they would return the citizens of each city and town to observance, however that does not mean that the actual war was for the purpose of un-assimilating the assimilated. It was a collateral benefit for sure, but it was not the objective. The objectives were autonomy, religious freedom, and the Temple.</p>
<p>The war was won when those three objectives were secured. The Book of Maccabees tells us very little about the Hellenized Jews living in the Land of Israel after the Maccabees had vanquished the Syrian-Greeks. Apparently, it was not an important fact to report. The battles were important. Winning the war was important.</p>
<p>So when we look at Chanukah through this lens, I am no longer convinced that the war was a civil war between Traditional and Hellenized Jews as it has been presented. It was a battle for the right to practice as Traditional Jews. The Hellenized Jews were apathetic to the goals of the Maccabee, and the Maccabees did what they could to restore the glory of Torah and Mitzvos to the Hellenists. But to make the entire story about defeating assimilation and assimilated Jews is not true to the story. Perhaps without a Meccabeean victory, total assimilation would have been inevitable, however there is no indication that anyone was pushing Traditional Jews to assimilate other than the Syrian-Greeks and other than through threat to life.</p>
<p>One can certainly argue that the meaning of the holiday should be informed by the staunch anti-assimilation stance the Maccabees took. It’s certainly possible. But is it the only interpretation of the story? Certainly not. Is it a tenet of our faith or a necessary component to the celebration of the holiday to hold that the war was not really a physical struggle, but a spiritual struggle and the real enemy was not the Syrian-Greeks, rather it was the Hellenists? Hardly. Is it still ironic if secular or marginally religious Jews celebrate Chanukah? I don’t think so.<br />
The holiday celebrates the restoration of the incredible opportunity to serve God as we were commanded. It was not merely a celebration of staving off assimilation. It was much more than that and focusing on assimilation detracts from the more prominent aspects of the story. And so, I think that if assimilated Jews are celebrating their sort of Chanukah despite their assimilation, they are more like the Maccabees than the Hellenized Jews. They are not allowing themselves to completely disappear. They are not identifying with the Syrian-Greeks who lost the war, nor the Hellenists who played at most a secondary role during the Chanukah story. Indeed, they identify with the Maccabees by celebrating a Jewish religious holiday while steeped in a very seductive American culture. There is nothing ironic or foolish about that. Nothing at all.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal has a nice piece on Dr. Jonathan Halpert. He is the YU basketball coach of 39 years. That is a long time to be doing any job. Certainly in a field dominated by the coaching carousel, it is a worthy achievement.</p>
<p>The article is nice. It tells of the challenges of managing a team of Orthodox Jewish basketball players. Shabbos and Holidays are off limits to games and practices. The daily grind of a YU student includes religious studies until mid afternoon and then secular classes that can go until 8 PM.</p>
<p>Halpert gives the reader insight into his coaching and life philosophy and as a reader I found him to be inspiring.<span id="more-3420"></span></p>
<p>In the article, there is one anecdote about making an impact on a player&#8217;s life.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There was the player who was cut but served as team manager for a year, made the squad the following season and hit a game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. Dr. Halpert made five DVDs of the game for the player to show to his children. &#8220;That&#8217;s good to keep you going another five years,&#8221; he said.</em></p>
<p>A nice story. But even nicer because I happen to know that player.</p>
<p>That player is Aryeh Magilnick. Son of PJC members <strong>Judd</strong> and <strong>Denise Magilnick</strong>.</p>
<p>And I happen to know what shot Halpert was referring to. And now you do too.</p>
<p>Click the video to watch Aryeh Magilnick hit a classic buzzer beater. (Assume there is a buzzer and that the shot was released just before the buzzer sounded.)</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></em></p>
<h1>Commitment and Pride</h1>
<p>The pursuit of success is a human attribute which enables individuals to shteig in ruchniyus and to achieve accomplishments in their inyanei d’alma as well. There is so much to strive for in every aspect of our lives. Yet, we often wonder, “how do we know if we are matzliach?” What is the formula for achieving true hatzlacha – success? Parshas Vayeishev offers a clue as it sheds light on the essence of our Chanukah experience.<span id="more-1833"></span></p>
<p>The posuk states Vayihi Hashem es Yosef vayihi ish matzliach – Hashem was with Yosef  and he was a man of success!. What was his secret. Rashi tells us succinctly, it was that Shem Shamayim shagur b’piv – Hashem name was free flowing from his mouth. Chazal explain this was not only Yosef’s response to poverty and servitude. He did not pray and turn to the Aibeshter only out of desperation, rather, even as he rose to a position of power and trust in Potiphar’s house, he was committed and proud of his Jewishness. Yosef never took Hashem Yisborach out of the picture, neither did Yehuda and his brothers. Yosef recognized, as the Tanchuma points out, haya Hashem imo kshahaya b’ravcha v’hayah imo btzaar. He kept Hashem at his side when times were good and when they weren’t. Yosef knew that if “G-d was his co-pilot” then he (Yosef) was in the wrong seat. It is Hashem Yisborach who is the pilot!</p>
<p>Chazal teach that the posuk &#8220;Boruch hagever asher yiftach baHashem&#8221; refers to Yosef. That was why he was an ish matzliach! With all of his hishtadlus, intelligence, good looks, leadership and administrative prowess Yosef puts Hashem Yisborach first. He knew, as the special Chanukah Haftorah reminds us, lo b’chayil vlo bkoach ki im bruchi amar Hashem!</p>
<p>But it is not enough to think emunah and bitachon. One must live with mi laHashem eilai as their mantra and model it 24/7. Though both Yosef’s hatzlacha and the victory of the Maccabim started with personal bitachon, it was, nonetheless, climaxed with living those values when it counted. Being closet Jews would not cut it. Not in the fleshpots of Mitzrayim or the caves of the Judean hills. Yosef did not keep his yiddishkeit in the closet. It followed him out of the Beis Medrash and into the work place! There was no double standard for honesty or integrity, sensitivity or decency. So spiritual and extraordinary was his character that the Torah declares vayar adonav ki Hashem ito, –  even an idolatrous Mitzri perceived his tzidkus and quickly recognized, appreciated and even rewarded Yosef for being the Tzadik that he was. Yes, Potiphar understood from Yosef’s actions v’chol asher hu oseh Hashem matzliach biyado.</p>
<p>The Maccabim, too, could not only keep their Yiddishkeit in hiding. They declared mi laHashem eilai! Their public devotion to mesorah is the original pisumei nisa – a proud, public display of their Yiddishkeit for all to see. They made sure that klal Yisrael would stand up and even fight for their beliefs. There would be no giving in to the decadence of contemporary society. They were tocho kibaro, ready and willing to be mosser nefesh for what was right not just because it looked good, but because it was Hashem demanded. With that pride, passion and fervor they were zoche to see one tiny flame burn for eight days. Each Yid, young and old can be inspired to live like Yossef Hatzaddik and the Maccabim still today. It just takes commitment and pride inside and out for all to see.</p>
