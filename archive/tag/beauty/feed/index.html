<p>If my last three posts offended you or made no sense to you, I hope I can win you back with today&#8217;s post.</p>
<p>This is one of most beautiful videos I have ever seen.</p>
<p>It was shot in the arctic circle and demonstrates one of the more fascinating phenomena on planet earth. The sun barely rises above the horizon, moves a bit to the side and then sets shortly thereafter.<span id="more-4310"></span></p>
<p>Much of Jewish law is predicated on when the sun rises and sets. It assumes a fairly balanced day as far as daylight and darkness with variations for summer and winter. But I just can&#8217;t imagine a 2 hour Shabbos or 2 hour fast day. Maybe that is why orthodox Jews don&#8217;t live (as far as I know,) in the arctic circle.</p>
<p>Our world is so beautiful. Enjoy it!</p>

<p>Back then, I wrote a little piece called <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/26/solar-eclipse-in-judaism/" target="_blank">Solar Eclipse in Judaism</a> that explains the famous Talmudic reasons for eclipse.</p>
<p>Recently I came across this incredible video by the BBC. They capture amazing footage of the actual eclipse, the sights and sounds of Southeast Asians observing the eclipse, put it to some beautiful music and have some annoying dude giving his idiotic commentary <span id="more-2242"></span>(oops did I say that out loud?).</p>
<p>Check out the video. Appreciate the beauty and try to explain what in the world the commentator is saying at the end when he says:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If you ever needed convincing that we are in a solar system&#8230; then look at that. That is the Solar System coming down and grabbing you by the throat.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Huh? Are there really people who doubt that there is a solar system? What is he talking about? And why does the BBC leave his moronic commentary on their productions?</p>
<p>Anyway, as much as he tries, he can&#8217;t ruin the stunning beauty of the video. Enjoy&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1071" title="Rock Garden" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/huntington-library-huntington-botanical-gardens-san-marino-ca273-300x225.jpg" alt="Rock Garden" width="300" height="225" />We took the family on a Sunday trip to Pasadena to see the famous <a href="http://www.huntington.org/" target="_blank">Huntington Gardens</a>.</p>
<p>Esteemed Pacific Jewish Center, Board Member, Alan Lipman first told me about this landmark a few months back. He described Huntington Gardens as a place of natural beauty, educational value and cultural significance. I had been looking forward to seeing the gardens in person ever since then.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I discovered for myself that Huntington Gardens is a &#8220;must see&#8221; attraction in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p><span id="more-1055"></span></p>
<p>Henry E. Huntington was a very wealthy man living at the turn of the (previous) century. He amassed great wealth and spent much of his time and money cultivating a large library of rare book and manuscripts as well as valuable artwork from around the world. On his property, Huntington built botanical gardens of various locales and cultures.</p>
<p>The entire property was donated to the public as a place of education and natural beauty.</p>
<p>We began our day in the library. There is a Guttenberg Bible prominently displayed just as you enter the library. I am always amazed by old books. My grandfather, Sidney Greenwald, had a huge collection of antique Jewish books that I just loved to peruse and listen to him tell the tales of each volume. To a slightly lesser degree I enjoy old secular books and books from other religions, but in any case, I am always drawn in by old books. The Huntington Library is incredible. I saw a first edition copy of The Federalist, I saw a facsimile of the original copy of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery that Huntington owned and I saw Aesop&#8217;s Fables hand written from the 14th century. Of course there were many others as well. I was also pleasantly surprised by my 6 year old&#8217;s budding interest in the antique books; &#8220;a chip off the old block&#8221;.</p>
<p>We moved on from the library to the Children&#8217;s Gardens. There we found a wonderful exhibit on all types of flora from various climates and conditions. The exhibit is extremely kid friendly and any grade school child will love experimenting and learning as much as our son.</p>
<p>Just outside the doors of the exhibit is the actual Childrens Gardens. With fountains, tunnels and quaint play areas there was plenty to see and to do. We already had enough fun to make the trip worthwhile.</p>
<p>Then we went to see the Chinese Gardens and take the beautiful walk from the Chinese Gardens to the Japanese Gardens. The gardens are magnificent. The landscapes, use of water and bridges as well as plant life made us feel as if we were walking in a royal garden in a castle somewhere. The views were breathtaking and inspired a lit of photography. I found some similar photos to ours online so you can get an idea for what we were enjoying.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1059 aligncenter" title="Chinese Garden" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/3169513271_c511a40679.jpg" alt="Chinese Garden" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1056 aligncenter" title="Japanese Garden" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/huntington.jpg" alt="Japanese Garden" width="498" height="374" /></p>
<p>Pretty incredible. One thing that I really loved was the rock garden in the Japanese Garden (see top photo). It was so Zen and peaceful it made we wishfully consider having a Zen rock garden in my back yard.</p>
<p>After the Chinese and Japanese Gardens we quickly walked through the art gallery. Our children were getting tired and we only spent a few moments in the gallery. Needless to say, the art gallery is home to some absolutely stunning pieces of artwork. I loved the landscapes. The attention to detail, while giving the eye a chance to appreciate the entire canvas is truly an art form within an art form.</p>
<p>We ended our outing with a walk through the Rose Gardens.</p>
<p>It was time for us to leave and yet we already knew that we would return sometime soon to see the Jungle Gardens, the Palm Gardens and to spend more time in the art gallery.</p>
<p>In a city of superficiality and make-believe, The Huntington Gardens stand out as a wholesome, educational, beautiful place to visit.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend making it part of your itinerary. Whether you live in Los Angeles and are looking for a Sunday day trip or are planning a Los Angeles Vacation, the Huntington Gardens must be on your list.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week the world witnessed another wonder of our universe, the Solar Eclipse. This eclipse was visible from Southeast Asia and was the longest eclipse in 18 years and will remain the longest for the next 123 years.</p>
<p>The eclipse has long been associated with mythology and supernatural acts. If you are a fan of the TV show, <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/" target="_blank">Heroes</a>, you know what I mean.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iX8d-T09U9BY--80N9QWImFwW2ewD99JN2T01" target="_blank">many Hindus were gripped by fear</a>. According to Hindu  tradition, the eclipse can cause harm to unborn children. Many ancient cultures attached mythological meaning to solar eclipses. Today, we know that the eclipse is part of the solar pattern that is predictable to the second.</p>
<p>What about Judaism? What do we say about the solar eclipse?</p>
<p><span id="more-894"></span>The Talmud in Sukkah (29a) gives us a clue.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>The Rabbis taught: </em><span style="font-weight:normal;"><em>An account of four things the sun is [eclipsed]: An improperly eulogized head of Jewish court, a betrothed girl who is raped and her cries go unheeded, [...], and two brothers killed on one day.</em></span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">What in the world does this mean?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">Is this more mythology? </span></strong></p>
<p>The 19th Century German Torah Scholar, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Ettlinger" target="_blank">Yaakov Etlinger</a>, writes in his Aruch L&#8217;Ner, that the Talmudic Rabbis certainly knew eclipses were natural phenomena running their course. (He proves this with inferences from within the text which are too tedious and lost in translation to English). It is similar to what Nachmanadies writes with regard to the Biblical promise after the Great Flood that God would not flood the world again, and he sealed the promise with the rainbow. Of course, the rainbow always existed, it is a natural phenomena. Nachmanadies explains that the rainbow is a sign, a reminder to us and in a different sense to God that He made a promise never to destroy His world again.</p>
<p>Simililarly, when a solar eclipse occurs and the light is temporarily removed from the physical world we are reminded of the moral implications of a dark world. A world in which good leaders are quickly forgotten, women are treated as objects and blood is spilled within one family, is a world of darkness.</p>
<p>When we see the eclipse we are to remember that it is our job as human beings to bring light into our world. The light of morality, mindfulness and sensitivity will protect our society from these terrible social ills mentioned in Sukkah. It is important to recognize what a world we would have if there was no moral light. If our world was thrust into spiritual darkness just as the physical world is thrust into sudden solar darkness during an eclipse our world would be quite different. Seeing this occur in the natural world &#8220;enlightens&#8221; us to provide that light and prevent the spiritual darkness from overcoming the light.</p>
<p>I think it is absolutely magnificent to live a life where we find meaning and messages from every part of our lives. A life where each moment makes a difference and each of our choices can change the world.</p>
<p>Equally magnificent is the sheer physical beauty of the solar eclipse.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this post. In appreciation I have provided some of the best footage (seen on NYTimes.com) of last week&#8217;s eclipse. Enjoy it &#8211; you deserve it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I flew cross country. Our route: LAX &#8212;&gt; JFK.</p>
<p>Something profound happened aboard that aircraft and that is the point behind this post.</p>
<p>While cruising at 30,000 feet we witnessed an amazing sight.<span id="more-787"></span></p>
<p>Our son Rami, saw it first. Looking out the window he saw giant flashes of white. The flashes were streaking across the evening sky. As we were above the clouds, the flashes were reflected off the clouds making for quite a light show.</p>
<p>We were witnessing a lightning storm. At 30,000 feet the lightning is pure. Unblocked by trees and buildings, we were able to watch the lightning for a little while and it was truly spectacular. We had front row seats to an inspiring show of natural beauty.</p>
<p>I looked around and found a video that depicts a similar &#8220;show&#8221; to what we were treated to. I think ours was even better.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='980' height='582' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/nZeZRCuimKU?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>As an observant Jew, I believe these natural beauties are placed into our natural world by God. It is inspiring to see such beauty up close. Observing such spectacular natural wonders reaffirms my belief in an all-powerful and good God.</p>
<p>As I was contemplating this very idea, I remembered something I heard from my Rebbe.</p>
<p>It is one thing to see Godliness in natural beauty. The rational behind this is that God placed the tools in the universe that can manifest as a spectacular lightning storm or grandiose waterfall or a Grand Canyon or a sparkling shooting star. Additionally, every moment of the universe&#8217;s existence is willed by God so it is easy to &#8220;give God the credit&#8221; for natural beauty.</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of the &#8220;<a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/planet-earth/planet-earth.html" target="_blank">Planet Earth</a>&#8221; series for this reason. When we see the natural beauty that exists in our world we are inspired.</p>
<p>My Rebbe says that it is even more incredible when we see Godliness in Man&#8217;s accomplishments. If we can walk past a skyscraper or beautiful display of artwork and see Godliness that is even more impressive.</p>
<p>Meaning, the fact that man has the ability to do such impressive things can also be attributed to God. It was God who gave Man the ability to produce such amazing results.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we see a &#8220;man made&#8221; creation and we can be inspired to see Godliness we are on a higher level of understanding and reality than when we see Godliness in natural beauty.</p>
<p>As this thought crossed my mind I realized how remarkable it is to fly in an airplane. A capsule the size of a skyscraper hurtling through the air at high speeds, transporting hundreds of people, on a system that can bring people to an incredible amount of different destinations.</p>
<p>Yes, we do have pet peeves about flying (more on that another time) but that should not take away from our appreciation for the advanced technology and innovation necessary for airplane travel.</p>
<p>As I was seeing a natural phenomena that blew my mind I was sitting in an airplane whose technology blows my mind as well.</p>
<p>That was an eye opening trip.</p>

Tonight we traversed all across the Torah spectrum. We talked about the Ner Tamid in every shul, the splitting of the sea, therapy and &quot;American Pie&quot; (the song not the movie). We learned about beauty and we enjoyed some incredible connections. That is what it is all about - right? You will find a lot of interesting ideas discussed and bandied about in this class.
