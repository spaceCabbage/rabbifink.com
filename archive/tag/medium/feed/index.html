				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On November 24, 2014, Sony Pictures was attacked by hackers. Attacked is the proper word to describe hacking in this context. The hackers intended to harm Sony financially and instill fear into the hearts of the studio’s executives and employees. Sites like Lifehacker make hacking sound like a cutesy hobby, but it is not cutesy. It is destructive and a form of terrorism.</p>
<p>The victims of the attack feel vulnerable, abused, and angry. Digital burglars stole their personal information and private data. That hurts. Victims deserve our empathy and kindness. The breach itself is enough to cause real pain and suffering, but that is only a small piece of the destruction the hackers have wrought.<span id="more-8991"></span></p>
<p>Every time someone reads a nugget of personal information or consumes media stolen by hackers, the knife is being plunged into their backs again, and again.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/12/04/the-proper-response-to-hacking/cyber-attack-hacker/" rel="attachment wp-att-8992"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8992" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cyber-attack-hacker.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="cyber-attack-hacker" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> The first blow is struck when hackers gain illicit access to private materials. It hurts to be violated. It also hurts that a few anonymous people know things that are supposed to be secret. Blame the hackers for the agony caused by their actual breach and the discomfort they caused by knowing things they should not know.</p>
<p>At that moment, publicly releasing all the confidential information and data has no further inherent negative consequence. That is to say, when hackers leak stolen information, the leak is not the thing that hurts. The thing that hurts is the public imbibing in the leak. If no one would care to taste the forbidden fruit the hackers are dangling in front of us, the victims would suffer no further harm. The leak hurts so much because far too many voyeurs gleefully devour the forbidden fruit. That’s on the voyeurs, not the hackers. That’s not kindness to victims of an attack.</p>
<p>It’s true that the hackers are the thieves. That’s evil. But the rest of us are “in possession of stolen property.” That’s also evil. We understand that viewing child pornography is immoral even though the viewer has not taken the photos or taken advantage of a child. But the demand for depraved images contributes to the market by giving the images value. If no one would look, fewer images would be produced.</p>
<p>Hacking is not the same as child pornography. But the personal violation is similar. No one granted us permission to view these divulged secrets. Hacking would be practically useless if we all agreed to embargo anything that is leaked by the hackers. But we don’t do that. Sadly, there is demand for hacked data. We drive the market. We glorify the hackers and get drunk on illicit access to intimate secrets. Suddenly, we are all Peeping Toms.</p>
<p><strong>I doubt we can figure out a way to stop hackers from hacking. I am hopeful that we can find a way not to look.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a lesson taught very early in the Bible. Upon witnessing the destruction of his world, Noah gets drunk and his sons discover him sprawled naked on the ground. One son stares. Two sons look away and cover their father’s shame. They are praised. The other is cursed. When we are confronted by the shame or nakedness or private information of others, there is only one moral choice. Gawking is a curse. Look away and cover their shame. That’s blessing. It’s what we would want others to do for us.</p>
<p>When hackers steal private information, it’s on us to ignore it. When hackers release pirated movies, it’s on us to go to the theater and pay to see the film. When hackers want to tell us secrets, it’s on us to ignore them. When hackers leak intimate photos of celebrities, it’s on society to look the other way and cover their shame. Our voyeurism is the fuel to the hackers’ fire. If we would just walk away, the fire would burn itself out. When we gawk, we are no longer innocent. We step across the moral line and we become the hackers.</p>
<p>Let’s neuter hacking. Don’t look. Avert your gaze. Respect privacy, especially betrayed privacy. Let’s make our society a place that refuses to drive the hacking market. Let’s care more about the victims of hacking than our prurient curiosity. Let’s not be voyeurs peering luridly into the figurative bedrooms of others as they suffer. Let’s knock on the door, offer our care and concern, and be their security blanket.</p>

<p>I wrote it on Medium because of the possibility for greater exposure. Viral posts on Medium have more potential than posts on my personal blog. So head on over to Medium, read the article, click Recommend and Share on Twitter and Facebook when you&#8217;re done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Cross-posted at <a href="https://medium.com/p/384410654ced" target="_blank">Medium</a></em></p>
<p>In the old days, when it was still cool to be a racist, people felt superior to other people because of the color of their skin. A white person was automatically better, smarter, more worthy than a non-white person and the average white person thought this was acceptable. This resulted in slavery, segregation, vigilante justice, and the dehumanization of black people.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have progressed as a society to the point where that kind of thinking is abhorrent and is considered wrong. That’s the good news.</p>
<p>However, we have also spawned a new form of racism. This is a much more subtle racism but equally nefarious.<span id="more-7398"></span></p>
<p>In the wake of the George Zimmerman trial we have seen strong reactions from some members of the black community decrying the lack of justice for Trayvon Martin. There is an equally strong counter-reaction explaining that it’s okay to suspect black people of crimes because the statistics support suspicion. This latter group are the modern racists.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7399" alt="6122894190_64c17ede01_b" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6122894190_64c17ede01_b.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" />The statistics show that black people commit a higher proportion of crimes than white people. Leaving aside the difficulties presented by the bias of selective enforcement and selective prosecution, I argue that using these statistics at all is an example of modern racism.A statistic is only meaningful if the data being used is a factor in the conclusion. For example, (and this is completely fictional) if I were to show that the majority of red haired women possesed below average intelligence, that statistic would not be meaningful unless I showed a causation between hair color and inferior intelligence. If I can’t show that, the statistic is meaningless. Even if the statistic is “true” it still doesn’t tell me anything about other red haired women. It just means that red haired people are not a significant group with enough specific traits to be classsified as a group with particular characteristics and predictable tendencies.</p>
<p>Categorizing all black people as one large group where the acts of one black person in Florida somehow tell us something about a different black person in Seattle is racist. Even within the same community it can be offensive to group people together because they share a skin tone. If the only thing two people share is skin tone then we cannot make any meaningful inferences from one person’s behavior to the other person’s behavior.</p>
<p>If we make judgments for the entire arbitrarily created group, we are being racists. There is no reason that the act of a black man in Texas should mean more about the potential acts of a black man in Michigan than his acts should inform us about a a white Norwegian woman or an indigenous Korean man. The only reason to connect the imaginary dots between all people of color is because there is a fallacious assumption that all people of color share some attribute that makes what one black person does meaningful in the analysis of what another will do. This is racist.</p>
<p>It’s not racist in the old fashioned lynch mob way. But it is still racist to presume one knows things about one black person simply because another black person or group of black people act a certain way.</p>
<p>I find that this is a very difficult concept for some people. These people clearly think that there actually is a black predisposition toward illegal or dangerous activity.</p>
<p>We must not tolerate that kind of thinking in 2013.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/life-preserver.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7244" alt="life-preserver" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/life-preserver.jpg?resize=300%2C225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I don’t think it matters much what Jewish law would say about the government snooping on its citizens. The government is not subject to Jewish law and its citizens don’t expect the government to conform its policies to Jewish law. Yet, there seems to be value in such analysis as I have been asked this question by several people.</p>
<p>As is often the case, we have two competing interests at stake. Privacy on one hand and safety on the other. Both of these interests are recognized in Jewish law. But they are completely different planes.</p>
<p>Life is primary in Jewish law. All else comes after life. One is not permitted to kill. One is not permitted to commit suicide. One is not permitted to harm one self. One is not permitted to place one’s life in danger. One is obligated to violate Jewish law in order to save one’s own life (with three exceptions &#8211; murder, idolatry, and adultery). The sanctity of life is of the utmost importance in Jewish law. These particular laws are derived from primary sources in the Torah and Mishna.<span id="more-7243"></span></p>
<p>There is also a prohibition against snooping on one’s neighbor in Jewish law. One is not permitted to place a window overlooking one’s neighbor’s private property. This sort of loss of privacy gives rise to a civil action in Jewish court. Some authorties extend right of privacy to include eavesdropping or even accidentally hearing others in private conversation.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is standing prohibtion in Jewish law against sharing anything revealed in private conversation. Without specifically stating that a conversation is allowed to be shared, it is required to be kept in confidence.</p>
<p>Finally, much later on in Jewish legal history a ban was placed on reading the private communications of others. This decree originally applied to mail but many authorities now extend it to all forms of communication.</p>
<p>These considerations all apply today and would apply to governments as well.</p>
<p>However, none of these considerations overrides the sanctity of life. If just one life could be saved it seems that all these rules could be ignored. Certainly, it would be expected that the minimal intrusion to save the life would be made. Saving a life is not a license to do as one pleases. Further, use of the information gathered would be limited to the purpose of saving lives and nothing else.The interesting thing here is that one life is enough for all our privacy to be suspended. One life is all it takes.</p>
<p>It would seem that as long as lives are being saved, the government is not bound by the strict privacy laws or decrees. The question then becomes whether lives are actually being saved. I don’t know the answer to that question. But that is the issue. It is the only issue.If there is a threat of loss of life, the government or any private citizen would have the right and according to some authorities the obligation to spy on its citizens to protect others.</p>
<p>I think it is laudible that the government takes the lives of its citizens so seriously. Obviously there are concerns that the government will use the information obtained improperly. However, there can be no prohibition against the gathering of the information so long as lives are at stake.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6761" alt="Westboro Baptist Church members protest at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/westboro.jpg?resize=300%2C200" data-recalc-dims="1" />We&#8217;ve all heard of the Westboro Baptist Church. They are the guys who protest at the funerals of U.S. soldiers blaming their deaths on gays in the military. They also hate Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Lady Gaga, obviously President Obama, and they love using the word fag.</p>
<p>But the church is not really a church and their worldview is not limited to making public protests. The church is more like a family. Almost everyone is related to the head of the church, Fred Phelps. Their theology is a very chaste brand of Baptist style Christianity and is consistently conservative. Check out this great documentary on the WBC: <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xtfgxo_the-most-hated-family-in-america_shortfilms" target="_blank">The Most Hated Family in America</a>. <em>(Another previous documentary filmmaker wound up joining the church!)</em></p>
<p>Megan Phelps-Roper was considered the future of the church. A few weeks ago she left the church and won&#8217;t be going back. I learned that one of the keys to her successfully leaving the church was David Abitbol, otherwise known at @Jewlicious on Twitter. Abitbol used theological arguments to diffuse much of what Megan had been taught. She didn&#8217;t leave right away. She kept trying to revive her faith and believe as she always had. But she simply could not. So she left.</p>
<p>As an aside, how cool is that? Amazing work by Abitbol. He was outraged by the WBC so he did something about it. Very impressive.<span id="more-6760"></span> The rest of us were just outraged. The best I could muster was a 25 page paper trying to figure out a way they could be sued without protection from the 1st Amendment.</p>
<p>I found Megan on Facebook and requested to be her friend. She accepted and I thanked her for accepting the request and in the process called her a hero.</p>
<p>To me, she is a hero because she is &#8220;one who shows great courage&#8221; and also because she is &#8220;an object of extreme admiration.&#8221; Obviously it takes great courage to leave one&#8217;s family and entire life behind. But what about Megan is worthy of &#8220;extreme admiration?&#8221;</p>
<p>More to the point, should, as a religious orthodox Jew, be admiring someone who has forsaken their religion? Is there something hypocritical about admiring her for leaving her group and me sticking to mine?</p>
<p>I have two responses.</p>
<p>First, there is no comparison between the beliefs of the WBC and orthodox Judaism. The WBC puts the focus of their religion on hate. While orthodox Judaism does have some abhorrent beliefs, these are not core beliefs, nor are they central to observance today. If a person didn&#8217;t believe in the abhorrent parts of Judaism, no one would even know. Whereas in the WBC, those beliefs are the cornerstone of their religious observance. You can&#8217;t possibly avoid it.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think everyone should challenge their beliefs. It&#8217;s not easy to challenge one&#8217;s own beliefs and subject one&#8217;s views to scrutiny. Many of our great rabbis prohibited us from doing that. They felt it is too dangerous. We are strongly urged not to read books that are contradictory to our faith. They might be dangerous. But it&#8217;s also dangerous not to analyze one&#8217;s beliefs at all. It&#8217;s also dangerous if one expects every answer to be perfect. There are not always good answers. We need to be able to be comfortable without all the answers. But as our great rabbis taught us, we must know what to answer. Sometimes, the answer is &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Other times, the answer is &#8220;A is better than B, but A is not perfect.&#8221; Clearly, we are supposed to subjugate our beliefs to some testing so that we will have some answers.</p>
<p>Questions without any answers led Megan away from the WBC but Megan has not left religion. She simply left a hateful, hurtful, twisted brand of religion.</p>
<p>Megan challenged her beliefs and her beliefs failed to stand up to the most basic of questions. Walking away from one&#8217;s entire family because one is fairly certain their beliefs are false and harmful takes great bravery. It is admirable to do what one feels is right against the odds. If I was as convinced that what I was doing is wrong as Megan was convinced about her beliefs, I would hope to have as much courage as Megan. So yes, what she did was admirable. Challenging conventional wisdom and changing one&#8217;s beliefs is admirable. Doing it and acting on it is heroic.</p>
<p>The world would be a far greater place if more of us challenged conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>I hope we will hear more from Megan in the future. Hers is an important voice in the religious discourse of the 21st century.</p>
