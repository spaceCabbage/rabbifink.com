Riding in the back of the bus has become identified with discrimination.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that when Hillary! Clinton, feminist extraordinaire, expressed her dismay when she heard that a democratic country like Israel had bus routes that were segregated by gender. On several bus routes in Israel men are in the front and women ride in back.</p>
<p>Hillary!&#8217;s comments drew the ire of many religious Jews. To them, this was such a minor issue in the grand scheme of things, and so unrelated to foreign affairs that Hillary! could only have been commenting on the bus situation because she is a jerk / anti-Semite / hates Israel / liberal / feminist / whatever. Now, I concede that Hillary! probably should not have created a big deal out of the segregated buses. However, I agree with her dismay.</p>
<p>There are three very big problems with these segregated buses.<span id="more-4964"></span></p>
<p>1) They are illegal. I am indebted to <a href="twitter.com/noahroth" target="_blank">Noah Roth</a> for summarizing the Supreme Court of Israel&#8217;s ruling that public transportation may not be segregated. The reasoning for the holding is similar to the separate <em>is not</em> equal argument that was made in Brown v. Board of Education in the Supreme Court of the United States. The bus drivers are not supposed to let the bus riders enforce a &#8220;voluntary&#8221; segregation and there is litigation in the lower Israeli courts right now attempting to force the drivers to enforce the law.</p>
<p>2) They are halachically unnecessary. Halachically speaking, there is no requirement for segregation between men and women. Some will argue that men and women are not allowed to touch each other and incidental touching is very likely to occur in a crowded bus. This has already been deemed a non-issue by R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein (Even HaEver 5:14). In his responsa, R&#8217; Moshe says that incidental touching on a bus is not a problem because it is not &#8220;derech chiba&#8221; which means that it is not intimate touching. (Again, HT Noah Roth for the cite.)</p>
<p>3) Segregated buses are a big deal with minimal benefit. Let&#8217;s assume that &#8220;kedushas einayim&#8221; is a super-vital element of worshiping God. (I believe it is overblown, but lets pretend that it&#8217;s not overblown for a moment). Does that mean that it is more valuable than many other Torah values? Does that mean that it is more important to have one&#8217;s eyes averted by default than it is to demean women?</p>
<p>If you are an apologist, you are saying to yourself that the women volunteer to move to the back, so what is the big deal? The big deal is the message it sends. It sends a message to the public that we appear to discriminate against women. Even if you don&#8217;t believe that seperate buses are discriminatory, and I concede that in some situations they might not be, they send a message to the less informed public that we do discriminate. This is an awful message. Not only does it affect our interactions with our non-Jewish friends and neighbors but I believe that the message of segregated buses to the public reflects back upon us and affirms to us that we are in fact discriminating. In other words, what others think of us can affect how we feel about our own actions.</p>
<p>But I think the more important message is the message we give ourselves when we institute (or tolerate) separate buses.  The message is that people are so highly sexualized that a casual encounter with any woman is enough to wreak havoc on a man&#8217;s soul. This is not a new trend, but no less disturbing. Charedi periodicals don&#8217;t show pictures of women. Even modestly dressed women. Even saintly women. None. (Let&#8217;s not forget that Hillary! was photoshopped out of a historic photo by a Charedi publication.) Little girls are not portrayed either. In fact, I&#8217;ve seen periodicals that had the faces of female INFANTS blurred out. That is sick.</p>
<p>This is a real problem. First of all, it legitimizes thinking sexually about every female in the world. It&#8217;s as if there is no choice. Women are purely sexual and we are helpless to our base desires. It says that it is impossible for men and women to interact normally.</p>
<p>It also tells our community that women are required to be out of the public eye no matter what. They are the unseen and unheard part of our community. I believe we lose a strong voice in our community if women are marginalized or at the least, made to think that that they suffer an incurable disease of attractiveness. We should focus our attention and efforts into learning how to function as normal, healthy, well-adjusted people in a society of men and women. Fighting this hard for separate buses indicates a horrible state of missed priorities.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the buses will reintegrate and holy Jews will learn how to be holy in the real world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/6-Suffragist-Picketing4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4349" title="6 Suffragist Picketing(4)" alt="" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/6-Suffragist-Picketing4.jpg?resize=300%2C288" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I am a big fan of Hakirah, a really nicely done Torah journal. I was turned onto the publication by a friend of mine who was published in the journal and am now a subscriber.</p>
<p>The most recent Hakirah attempted to begin to tackle the issue of women in the rabbinate. It began with a short article from <strong>Rabbi Herschel Schachter</strong> who did not do the subject justice but concluded, based on the laws of <em>tznius</em>, that a position such as Rabbi is not a preferable place for men or women due to its very public nature. However in choosing who should perform the public duties of a Rabbi, it is better to have men in a position of non-tznius than women.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s article is interesting but too short. It leaves way too much wiggle room and seems to be referring mostly to women pulpit rabbis.</p>
<p>The next article does a much more comprehensive job of dealing with the issue. Its authors are <strong>Rabbi Michael Broyde</strong> and <strong>Rabbi Shlomo Brody</strong>.</p>
<p>When I first broached this topic on this blog I did so in the context of social change. (PLEASE READ: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/23/patience-is-a-virtue-and-an-important-ingredient-for-change/">Patience Is A Virtue and An Important Ingredient For Change</a>) My premise is that all social change happens slowly. Change that is too quick or premature can backfire. I predicted that women would continue to see more prominent roles in areas of religious leadership over time.</p>
<p>My good friend <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a> vehemently disagreed with this wait and see approach. <span id="more-4344"></span>In his mind an injustice cannot be tolerated at all. Since he feels that the current situation for women in orthodox Judaism is an injustice, patience is a curse, not a cure. Now DovBear is entitled to shriek from the rooftops but that doesn&#8217;t mean anything will change. Personally, I am concerned with real change not just proclamations.</p>
<p>I view the issue primarily as a social one, not a <em>halachic</em> one. The reason for this is that I believe that the law will adapt to the social environment. However this is only possible if there is a halachic mechanism to give women a more prominent role in religious leadership. It has been demonsrated by Rabbis Broyde and Brody that it can. Certainly it can also be prohibited by law if one makes certain halachic decisions. But it would be equally halachically acceptable to adapt what is currently halachically acceptable. One major factor the Rabbis cite, is the public needs, desires and perception.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend reading the full article. I have uploaded an annotated version of the article with specific key points underlined. Read that here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Vol-11-Broyde.pdf" target="_blank">Hakirah Vol 11</a>.</p>
<p>My summary of the women in religious leadership roles in orthodox Judaism is as follows:</p>
<p>Many women in the Bible are heroes. They frequently possess keener insight than their male counterparts. Sometimes they are stronger than the men. Other times they play a secondary role, but star anyway. <em>Midrashim</em> also speak highly of women. In the law, women are afforded much more liberty and equality than in other ancient legal systems. In ancient times, the Torah was a progressive woman&#8217;s best hope. There is no indication in the Torah that women could not and should not be able to achieve the same level of scholarship or religious leadership as men. The one example where women are severely limited is in becoming king or by extension any other position of <em>serara.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Talmud</em> has several statements that seem to disparage women. The most classic example is the oft repeated prohibition against teaching women Torah. The Talmud explains this statement by one <em>Tanna</em> in a <em>Mishna</em> with the statement &#8220;<em>Nashim daatam kalos</em>&#8220;. Which literally translated means that women are weak-minded and since that is the case, it is futile to teach them Torah. The Rambam codifies this into halacha.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, for the bulk of the last 2000 years since the beginning of the Mishnaic period the sentiment that women are inferior has been accepted as fact. It is plain as day to see this fact when considering the great lengths women had to go in order to get equal rights in the greatest democracy in the world. Even as few as 103 years ago, the Supreme Court has no problem publishing an opinion based on the fact that women were primarily vehicles of reproductivity and must be protected from working too many hours lest we harm their reproductive prowess. As per the summary on Oyez.org &#8220;Brewer&#8217;s opinion conveyed the accepted wisdom of the day: that women were unequal and inferior to men.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1901-1939/1907/1907_107" target="_blank">Muller v. Oregon</a>).</p>
<p>2000 years ago it was a given. Women are inferior. It took thousands of years for the secular world to escape that mentality.</p>
<p>I am aware of the mental gymnastics and apologetics to excuse or &#8220;explain&#8221; what the Talmud meant. To me, they are useless. In a world where women have every opportunity that men have, women are choosing to accomplish things their grandmothers could never have dreamed. Orthodox Jewish women expect and should expect to have similar opportunities within their religion. AH! But it wasn&#8217;t ever this way! We ALWAYS did it the old way! How can we break from Tradition? Worse, are we violating halacha?!</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is no shame in admitting the mistakes of our past. The rabbis in the Talmud were entirely justified in using the feelings and temperament of their era in applying them to Torah and Law. I don&#8217;t believe that we are bound to maintain their opinions of women or anyone. Certainly they were wise and certainly they did the best they could to serve Hashem and teach us for posterity how to do the same. But they were people and people are subject to the notions and vicissitudes of their time.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>[I have been accused of being a &#8220;Conservative Rabbi&#8221; and a &#8220;fraud&#8221; for holding this position. I don&#8217;t believe this is a fair criticism. As per the Rambam, the variety of opinions on matters such as these are not part of the Oral Law passed down from Sinai to Moses and beyond. Thus, acknowledging that the rabbis of the Mishna and Talmud were able to formulate their own opinions and were not merely transmitting previously known information that was received at Sinai is not any more the attitude of a &#8220;Conservative Rabbinics&#8221; than it is the attitude of the Rambam.] </em></span></p>
<p>There is no shame in recognizing that the social environment and scientific data have changed our opinion of what women are capable of accomplishing. It would be foolish to assume that women are able to function at the highest levels of academia, science, politics, or any non-physical activity but would be unable to achieve great accomplishments in Torah and religious leadership. Indeed, they can.</p>
<p>The question is &#8220;may they?&#8221;.</p>
<p>To this question Rabbis Broyde and Brody answer a resounding&#8230; &#8220;Possibly&#8221;. But a key to their analysis is public acceptance of change in attitude towards women&#8217;s ever increasing role in orthodox Jewish religious life.</p>
<p>A century ago women had far fewer opportunities than they do today. As I wrote previously, the fact that women can study Torah in schools and places of higher learning and maintain positions of authority in Torah institutions is certainly a great innovation of the last 100 years. It is not to be taken lightly or for granted. The wisdom of our rabbis in allowing this change must be noted. The point is that women are on a track and the track is leading to a place of even greater opportunity for women. The only remaining question is how long it will take to get there.</p>
<p>When the public demands it, it will happen. When it becomes necessary it will happen. When the only obvious choice is to take that train to the next station, it will happen.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am not condoning the recent ordination of orthodox Jewish women as Rabbis (or Rabbas, or whatever). Nor am I proposing that within a few decades women will be taking positions as pulpit rabbis and Roshei Yeshiva. I am saying that there will be more opportunities for scholarship at least on par with the opportunities men have to study Torah vigorously. Correspondingly, there will be a need for women leaders and educators who have demonstrated mastery over their studies. Today, women are chosen as teachers and educators and yet, generally, compared with a mediocre yeshiva student they are ignoramuses. Creating greater opportunities for higher learning will change that. Women who are so inclined will able to receive recognition for scholarship and Torah knowledge. Our children will benefit from better school teachers. Our synagogues will benefit from better Torah classes given by women.</p>
<p>All this being said, it remains a choice for each woman or family to decide. Every family is different and some women may be happy or happier with more traditional roles. But those roles will be borne out of a choice as opposed to lack of choice. It will help women who make either choice, or if they can somehow choose both better Jews and better mother, each in their own way.</p>
<p>What should we do in the meantime? Rabbis Broyde and Brody said it best:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Women should sit and study for increasingly long periods of time, write serious scholarship in Torah, develop as inspiring spiritual personas, and lead Torah institutions, in function if not in form. In short, they should build the Orthodox community brick by brick, and see what happens over time.</em></p>
<p>So to summarize my summary:</p>
<p><em>Women used to be thought of as inferior. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with admitting that. But now we know they aren&#8217;t. They may have different roles. That should not preclude them from scholarship and recognition as Torah scholars and leaders. Eventually it won&#8217;t. Meanwhile, become scholars as best you can. This is all reconcilable with halacha. Of course it is.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tolerance.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3169" title="Tolerance" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Tolerance.jpg?resize=289%2C289" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In the comment threads that follow the two posts I wrote about Esther Petrack (who has been eliminated from ANTM) (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/16/esther-petrack-modern-orthodox-jewish-girl-on-americas-next-top-model-drops-shabbos-on-television/">Esther Petrack: Modern Orthodox Jewish Girl on America’s Next Top Model Drops Shabbos on Television</a> and <a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/2010/10/19/esther-petracks-mother-speaks-esther-is-observant-it-was-all-editing/">Esther Petrack&#8217;s Mother Speaks: Esther is observant, it was all editing</a>) I noticed something that I feel needs to be discussed.</p>
<p>Much of the conversation was about whether Esther could be considered &#8220;Orthodox&#8221; or &#8220;Modern Orthodox&#8221; in light of her decision to model. The first comment thread assumed that she dropped Shabbos (even though we knew it could be editing and my post was not about her per se) and the second thread assumed that even if she kept Shabbos there was a problem with her modeling.</p>
<p>Quite a few commenters found the need to &#8220;draw a line&#8221; between what they do and what Esther did. Some said she desecrated God&#8217;s name. Others said that violated a law and not being ashamed is enough for them to be ousted from orthodoxy or modern orthodoxy. I debated the merits of those claims on the thread (and even received a number of emails thanking me) and I don&#8217;t care to debate them further.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting is this need that has been expressed to self define by whom we exclude.<span id="more-3168"></span></p>
<p>This phenomena is part of what drove the &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; laws of the first half of the 20th century. Sure blacks couldn&#8217;t be used as slaves anymore, but by excluding them from social life, and certain privileges the white majority still felt superior.</p>
<p>In politics you&#8217;ll see the same kind of lines of demarcation drawn. Someone is only as right or left wing as they are compared to the next guy. So political groups find it necessary to define themselves by who and what they are not. The last two major election campaigns (&#8217;08, &#8217;10) both focused on change. &#8220;We are not like them&#8221;.</p>
<p>In religions it is the same way. Folks want to feel superior or more authentic so they say &#8220;we are the REAL ____ [Jews / Christian / Muslims (/ Atheists)]. Huge sects of Christianity and Islam are built on this principle. Judaism is smaller and has been united by common persecution so these tendencies may have existed but it did not yield similar results.</p>
<p>Once Jews were freed from the ghetto this phenomena found its way into Judaism. Different sects within Judaism formed and people began to define themselves by whom they were not like. Most people do what their parents do. It wasn&#8217;t a conscious choice, yet they self define &#8220;real Judaism&#8221; as their version. And their version can be so narrowly construed that no one else can fit in to their little world. It&#8217;s isolationism at its best.</p>
<p>This is what many Modern Orthodox Jews find so disturbing about Charedi Judaism. The Charedi establishment excludes non-conformists. This includes in action and in thought. For example Rabbi Natan Slifkin performs the same actions / mitzvos as the Charedim. But he is excluded for his thoughts. On the other hand, those who look the part but don&#8217;t act like Charedi Jews are also excluded. For some (maybe most) this doesn&#8217;t affect them because they have self selected themselves out of the Charedi world. But for Rabbi Slifkin who self selected himself as a Charedi Jew, this created a personal conflict. Subsequent to the entire affair he self excluded himself. The merits of Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s opinions and the merits of the Charedi criticisms are not relevant. The point is that he was excluded for his thoughts.</p>
<p>Modern Orthodox Jews are more inclusive. There is a broader range of activity and thought that is acceptable. But when someone so much as tiptoes over the line they are out. Rabbi Avi Weiss dared tread just across the line and everyone and their grandmother has &#8220;excluded&#8221; him or proclaimed him to be &#8220;beyond the pale&#8221;. The truth is that Modern Orthodoxy is more inclusive but only because they have a broader definition of what is acceptable thought and action. However, going outside that self-defined perimeter means you are outside Modern Orthodoxy. There is not more tolerance, just more tolerated activity.</p>
<p>The same thing drove the comments that ousted Esther Petrack from Modern Orthodoxy. Esther&#8217;s mother wrote that her family goes &#8220;mixed swimming&#8221; (and wear bathing suits in public). This is an accepted action within Modern Orthodoxy. (Forget halacha for a minute, this is a social issue, not a halachic issue.) Yet, Esther&#8217;s modeling was outside what some people want to define as Modern Orthodoxy so she is out. Esther self defines as Modern Orthodox. Somehow people think they have a right to tell others how they are to be defined.</p>
<p>How does it help Modern Orthodox Jew be a better person or a better Jew by excluding Esther? What is the motivation?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the same phenomena. People need to feel better about themselves and they take the feel good shortcut by telling themselves and others that they are better / more important / more religious / more privileged than someone else.</p>
<p>Isolating others from the place that they define as their place is self serving. Further it can hurt others. Esther is 18 years old. If you care about her as your sister and you want her to be successful professionally and more importantly, spiritually then you would be best served offering her support and reminding her that we are her family no matter what.</p>
<p>Teens who are at-risk are the darlings of the Orthodox Jewish community. Money, time, resources, blog posts and magazine articles are dedicated to solving their problems. Do we hear anyone trying to exclude them from the places they want to be included? Of course not. I am not equating at risk teens and Esther. All I am saying is that even we have come to understand that inclusion is a much more powerful tool than exclusion.</p>
<p>This is not just about Esther. It is about being inclusive. Halacha tells us how to act. It doesn&#8217;t tell us to exclude those who may not follow halacha to the standards that we arbitrarily create.</p>
<p>Above all else: V&#8217;ahavta l&#8217;reyacha kamocha, zeh klal gadol baTorah.</p>

<p><em><strong>Parts 1-3:</strong></em></p>
<p><em>&#8211;<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/09/simple-justice-the-story-of-brown-v-board-of-education-the-end-of-separate-but-equal-in-schools/">Simple Justice | The Story of Brown v. Board of Education: The End of Separate But Equal in Schools</a><br />

</em></p>
<p>In 1868 Black Americans were granted equal protection and citizenship in the United States of America. However, in 1896 the Supreme Court of the United States held in Plessy v. Ferguson that &#8220;separate was equal&#8221;. There was &#8220;no inferiority suggested by keeping races separate&#8221; and so things went for about 60 years. In 1954 in all changed. Brown v. Board of Education demonstrated to the SCOTUS that separate was not equal and it was held that states could not discriminate between races in matters that were of compelling government interest. The Civil Rights movement pressured states to remove all discriminatory laws and in 1964 the Civil Rights Act expanded the law forbidding discrimination to more scenarios. Today there is virtually no overt, legal discrimination in the United States of America.</p>
<p>How did one of the greatest legal and social changes in history occur?<span id="more-2291"></span></p>
<p>First of all, if occurred very slowly. It took nearly 100 years from the emancipation of slaves to achieve legal equality.</p>
<p>Second, it took a lot of effort, time and activism. It did not happen overnight. In fact if it would have happened overnight there may have been a very strong resistance to change that could have negatively affected the outcome. (See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/18/the-mechanics-of-change-and-how-to-make-a-difference/">The Mechanics of Change and How To Make A Difference</a>).</p>
<p>But bearing &#8220;<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/18/the-mechanics-of-change-and-how-to-make-a-difference/">The Mechanics of Change and How To Make A Difference</a>&#8221; in mind, the reason so much effort went into overturning Plessy is simply because of Plessy. In other words, being defeated in Plessy served as the primary motivation for working to overturn Plessy. <a title="Charles Hamilton Houston" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hamilton_Houston">Charles Houston</a>&#8216;s main motivation for teaching his law students, one of whom was <a title="Thurgood Marshall" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall">Thurgood Marshall</a> was to overturn Plessy. In the 20&#8217;s Houston was already preparing for a case that would not be heard until 30 years later.</p>
<p>For years, the NAACP lawyers honed their skills, rhetoric and arguments for their day in court. Brown did not happen in a vacuum. It was planned for years. But it did not happen with &#8220;one fell swoop&#8221;. It took patience, careful study and meticulous planning. Drastic change is very hard for people to accept. Organic change is more palatable. And organic change can be guided.</p>
<p>There is a similar phenomena taking place within Orthodox Judaism. There are some who would like to see women ordained as Rabbis or with a similar degree of recognition. The particulars of ordaining women rabbis is way beyond the scope of this blog post.</p>
<p>(Some of arguments are eerily familiar, &#8220;separate but equal&#8221;, &#8220;separate is not equal&#8221;, &#8220;if they feel inferior it is because of how they feel not how they are made to feel&#8230;&#8221; etc.)</p>
<p>That being said, if halachically acceptable change is to happen, it will only happen organically, or at least what is perceived as organic change.</p>
<p>Dramatic declaration, pronouncements and grand events will likely have the polar opposite of the intended effect. They will galvanize fundamentalists, cause activists to be branded as extremists with agendas and create a war.</p>
<p>However, change has been happening with Orthodox Judaism with regard to women&#8217;s opportunities and education for several decades now. If more progressive change is to happen it will most likely happen slowly and with quiet deliberation.</p>
<p>To illustrate: Women currently hold religious positions of authority within the ultra-Orthodox community that were untenable years ago. There are women who lead not-for-profits, there are women who lead schools, seminaries and activist groups. Change is already happening. I know it can be hard to wait. But just think about Charlie Houston. The man waited over 30 years to see the fruits of his labor and he died before his work was completed on his behalf. Patience is a virtue. In our instant gratification world, patience is not only a virtue, it is an endangered species.</p>
<p>I would urge those who want to see change to be patient. Take the lessons learned from some of the most dramatic changes in history that have occurred in the last century and I think things will look different to our children and grandchildren than they do to us.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this issue resolves itself, that is for sure.</p>

I began my talk by complimenting my parents and expressing my desire to emulate their parenting in the raising of my own children. One such example occurred today.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://lls.edu" target="_blank">Law School</a> we are reading some of the most well-known Supreme Court Cases. A few weeks ago we read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade" target="_blank">Roe v. Wade</a> (banning 1st term abortion is unconstitutional) and the even more important <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey" target="_blank">Casey v. Planned Parenthood</a> (upheld Roe) cases. Last week we read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson" target="_blank">Plessy v. Ferguson</a> (after Civil War, Separate but Equal schools were ruled constitutional).</p>
<p>This week we are reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education" target="_blank">Brown v. Board of Education</a>. This case overruled Plessy and made Separate but Equal unconstitutional in <strong><em>Public Schools</em></strong>.<span id="more-2235"></span> Brown v. Board of Education paved the way for Civil Rights activists like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to fight for equal rights for all people in all areas of life, beyond public education.</p>
<p>As I was reading the case I remembered a very influential &#8220;Parenting&#8221; episode from my youth. Growing up, we did not watch many movies. I saw a few movies on TV, like E.T. and The Wizard of Oz but that was about it. But I vividly remember my father strongly encouraging me to watch one particular movie with him when I was twelve years old.</p>
<p>That movie was a PBS special called The American Experience: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108139/fullcredits#cast" target="_blank">Simple Justice</a>. It beautifully told the story of Thurgood Marshall as he learned the law and was groomed into the perfect counsel for the Supreme Court cases to reverse Plessy. The climax of the movie is the Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education and the Court&#8217;s ruling that Separate but Equal was not constitutional.</p>
<p>My father wanted me to see it and I recall a strong desire to study the law and become a lawyer after watching it. My preferred career path took some detours along the way, but several years later my interest in the law returned in earnest.</p>
<p>Today, our professor at Loyola Law School, <a href="http://www.lls.edu/academics/faculty/strauss.html">Marcy Strauss</a>, showed the very same movie to the class in lieu of a more traditional lecture and Socratic discussion. All the memories I had as a youngster were re-energized and I was quite moved by the movie, again.</p>
<p>Brown v. Board of Education raises some very important issues that are still very relevant to modern discourse. In just 56 years, much has changed in the landscape of race relations in the USA. Some things are still the same, or at the very least follow the same bigoted roots. There are other minorities seeking equal rights as well. Sometimes, we can go overboard in our sensitivities as I will write about tomorrow. And sometimes, one part of the world can be slow to see that Separate cannot be Equal, as I will write about the next day.</p>
<p>This movie is a must see. My father was very wise to encourage me to see it and I will always remember watching it together with him. (Thank you.)</p>
<p>The part of the movie that moved me most when I was a youngster stuck with me until today. I was talking with some friends at school and I mentioned that while reading Brown v. Board of Education I recalled a scene from this very movie. I had no idea that we were going to be watching the movie in class. I recounted the scene as best as my 12 year old brain could understand it and it was just as I remembered it when I saw it tonight.</p>
<p>The scene is of a study that was being conducted to analyze the way segregated black children felt about themselves. The tester would ask questions of the children using dolls, one black and one white. The results of the test showed conclusively that black children felt inferior. The dramatization of the test was very powerful and I found it on youtube so that you can see it for yourself below.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;To a better tomorrow&#8221;</em></p>
