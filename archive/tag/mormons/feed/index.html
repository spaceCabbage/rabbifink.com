				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NY Times reports that there is a religious group that is losing even some of its most committed members because of what they are finding on the Internet. Sound familiar? The group is not orthodox Judaism, rather it is the Mormons.</p>
<p>Some people are quick to point out that orthodox Judaism is suffering a similar fate. According to the narrative, people get online, they see that their religion can be challenged and that there are many other perspectives in the world, and sometimes they leave. We discussed this in the context of the chasidic world here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/22/can-judaism-survive-the-internet/">Can Judaism Survive the Internet?</a>)</p>
<p>Mormons are finding that their religion is so nascent, their beliefs are based on so many contradictions and inconsistencies, and their prophet was a less than admirably role model, that their faith is irrevocably shaken. Some leave. Others stay and want to modernize it.<span id="more-7410"></span></p>
<p>In the context of chasidic Judaism I think the comparison is somewhat fair. The lifestyle is a fairly recent innovation, the beliefs can seem contradictory at times, and for some, finding out that a shtreimel is not holy can shake their faith. The Internet might be &#8220;to blame&#8221; for those people discovering that they have options.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7411" alt="google_1674887b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/google_1674887b-600x375.jpg" /></p>
<p>But I think most people who leave and use the Internet as a tool to assist them in their journey are bothered by social issues in the community. They dislike the lifestyle, or they think the leadership is corrupt, or the allure of freedom from religion is too great. For them, the Internet is more like a lobby where they can meet likeminded people. The Internet doesn&#8217;t cause the doubt, but it helps them deal with it and sometime it helps them leave.</p>
<p>The last few days have demonstrated another Internet driven issue in orthodox Judaism.  A local issue can become a global issue. A rabbi who writes controversial things becomes international news. Further, the materials that form the substance of his controversial statements are available for anyone to read. The challenges can be found on plenty of websites. The charges of heresy can be found on several websites as well.</p>
<p>However there is a disconnect. The Internet is the great liberator of minds. Being told what to think doesn&#8217;t really work anymore. Anyone can do their own research. In fact, R&#8217; Gordimer&#8217;s original article was using data that was a week old and required a simple click to verify if it was current. Obviously people called him on it. It&#8217;s so easy to do research today. We can verify and fact check and myth bust with ease. If a yeshiva student in the Mir circa 1967 wanted to read Biblical Criticism, where would he even go? But now, it&#8217;s all available. Google is a click away. People can read it for themselves. That was the thinking behind <a href="http://thetorah.com" target="_blank">TABS</a>. Provide a safe place to read Biblical Criticism in the context of orthodox Judaism. R&#8217; Farber was trying do that. Did he go too far? Is there such a thing as too far? These are the questions being addressed across the Internet right now.</p>
<p>The point is that drawing lines in the sand while expecting skeptics to just &#8220;listen&#8221; is so 1980s. It doesn&#8217;t work anymore. People can just look at the information and make their own determination. Perhaps many of these people are not qualified to make such judgments. But that doesn&#8217;t stop them.</p>
<p>While it is laudable that Cross-Currents is trying to address this issue, in my opinion they are not addressing it at all. Instead we are being told what to think without being told why. The only why we have heard is that if we think like R&#8217; Farber there will be dire consequences. Is that sufficient? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>The Internet is not going away. The questions that R&#8217; Farber addressed will be on the Internet forever. And there are more. The best defense I have seen so far is on TABS. The reason it is the best is because is simply because it is the only defense so far. We can lament the lack of scholars in the frum community willing to address these questions in the terms they are asked. But all we have to show for it are lamentations. Still no answers or explanations.</p>
<p>From the NY Times article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Mr. Mattsson said that when he started sharing what he had learned with other Mormons in Sweden, the stake president (who oversees a cluster of congregations) told him not to talk about it to any members, even his wife and children. He did not obey: “I said to them, why are you afraid for the truth?”</em></p>
<p>We say we have the truth. We should be trying to figure out how to reconcile it with other truths, not saying &#8220;we have the truth&#8221; so loudly that we are incapable of hearing anything else.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/god-in-clouds.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7299" alt="god-in-clouds" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/god-in-clouds-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a><em>The Challenge:</em></p>
<p><em>Write an article about modesty that is respectful to men and women, makes a case for an orthodox Jewish version of tznius, and it also has to make tznius sound pleasant.</em></p>
<p>Can I do it? This is my attempt.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of <i>tznius</i> in orthodox Judaism. The first is the concept of modesty. The second is the details of how <i>tznius</i> is observed in orthodox Judaism. I admit that it is much easier to make a case for the first aspect than it is for the second. But I submit that once one is convinced of the first aspect, the second aspect becomes much easier. But I am hopeful that we can carve out a third aspect to <i>tznius</i>, if not in practice yet, at least in theory.</p>
<p>The Sefer HaChinuch asks an excellent question. There is a mitzvah to kindle the fire of the altar in the Temple. A priest would light the fire every day. If the Temple needs a fire, someone has to to light it. The problem is that we have a tradition that the fire on the altar came from heaven and thus there was no need for a mere mortal to light the fire.</p>
<p><span id="more-7298"></span></p>
<p>Answers the Sefer HaChinuch, this is the way of God. Whenever God acts in a miraculous way that displays God&#8217;s greatness, God will seek to hide God&#8217;s greatness and make the miracle appear to be natural. There will always be a way to rationalize the miracle as a non-miracle. This explains the requirement that a priest light the fire on the altar. It must appear that God is not acting in a way that is clearly miraculous.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s reasonable to say that God&#8217;s &#8220;moment&#8221; in the Bible was the splitting of the Sea of Reeds. That was the bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, down by three runs, and God hits it out of the park for the win. It&#8217;s the defining moment in our relationship with God until this very day and one of the most dramatic episodes in the Bible. It&#8217;s very interesting to note what is recorded in the Torah before the sea actually split. We are told that Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and strong winds stirred up the sea water all night. The next day God split the sea.</p>
<p>The Chinuch explains that God&#8217;s miracles must be hidden. God could have been a show-off and designed this big moment to be as dramatic as possible. The waters could have been completely still, Moses could have been crying on his hands and knees begging for mercy, and then God would swoop in at the last possible moment and save the Israelites with a grand show. But instead God hid the miracle behind outstretched arms and swirling winds.</p>
<p>This is the way of our God. Our God is modest. Even our all powerful God chooses to limit God&#8217;s exposure when performing miracles. The Chinuch concludes that this is true greatness. One who is great is not one who needs to make a show of oneself. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Jewish modesty. <i>V&#8217;halachta b&#8217;drachav</i>. We emulate God&#8217;s character. <i>V&#8217;hatzneah leches im Elokecha</i>. Walk modestly with your God.</p>
<p>Every person should strive to be Godly. Greatness is found when people don&#8217;t expose everything. This is the paradigm that we learn from God. Overexposure is unGodly.</p>
<p>But what is the reason for this? Is it some rule that can&#8217;t be explained? Or can we make some sense of this?</p>
<p>I think it does have some basis in reality. We are easily distracted. Please note, I am not saying we are perverts or we have a hard time controlling ourselves. I am saying that our minds are biased towards simplicity and gravitate toward the external things that are easily seen. Marketers know this and they distract us with beautiful people in their ads for horse manure. But wisdom and maturity are seeing things that are beneath the surface. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>Of course it is entirely possible for a beautiful naked person to be espousing wisdom. It’s just harder to hear the wisdom. This had nothing to do with Judaism or God. Professors at universities, CEOs, and politicians in our Western society dress at least somewhat formally. We all understand this.</p>
<p>Taken to another level, we all disregard showboaters and over-aggressive, transparent, self-promotors. We dismiss those kinds of people and their ideas are taken far less seriously. Our minds know that greatness is usually not “in your face.” We know that greatness is hidden. I think this is the rational explanation for God&#8217;s behavior in hiding God&#8217;s miracles.</p>
<p>Modesty in Judaism is supposed to reflect this value. It applies equally to men and women and applies equally to clothing as it does to the rest of one&#8217;s life. This is the Jewish concept of modesty. It is the first aspect. It explains the value in limiting one&#8217;s external exposure.</p>
<p>If it ended here, we would all take this lesson to heart and try to make our own decisions in consonance with this ideal. Practices would vary but we would all try to live with this concept in our lives.</p>
<p>But orthodox Judaism is not just about ideas and concepts. The rabbis of the Talmud and their halachic heirs take these concepts and interpret them into laws. These are really old laws. Some are 2000 years old. Other more “recent” laws are only several hundred years old.</p>
<p>Over the millennia, the laws of each time and place were added to our legal codes. The rigid laws of our current <i>tznius</i> standards of clothing, whether from the stringent or lenient extremes are borne out of this system. They don&#8217;t really make sense today. They are not really expected to make sense today. These laws are mostly anachronistic.</p>
<p>Today’s laws seem to draw arbitrary lines about what can be seen and what may not be seen. There is little rhyme or reason and this is a breeding ground for stringencies and false displays of piety. With no firm halachic foundation, it is easy to invent new and improved ideas about <i>tznius </i>that can creep into society and become de facto standards seemingly overnight. Some people draw the line here and others draw the line over there. If you’re in doubt? Cover it up. Better to be safe than sorry. The spirit of <i>tznius </i>can be hard to find under these circumstances.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line it seems, we have collectively lost the ability to adapt our laws for modernity within the confines of halacha. That being said, orthodox Jews conform to halachic standards. Sometimes it&#8217;s not easy, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t really make perfect sense, but it&#8217;s the laws that we have and until they are abrogated they are the laws we must keep. This is the second aspect.</p>
<p>There is no real theological reason that <i>tznius</i> should be so heavily regulated and codified in Jewish law while all the other areas of our lives that require us to act with modesty are left to our whims and desires. Rather it is social. Dress codes and sensuality are things that people have traditionally been concerned with and thus we have a huge compilation of laws associated with <i>tznius</i>. This despite the fact that <i>tznius</i> in the Talmud is barely a blip on a very large radar. when it is mentioned it is mentioned as a restriction against reciting the Shema or matrimonial disputes. It is hardly recognizable as a formulaic dress code.</p>
<p>It can feel like there is a huge disconnect between the first aspect and the second aspect. To me it feels that way sometimes. But sometimes there is a price to pay if one wants to be part of orthodox Judaism. This is the way orthodox Judaism is now. It’s not perfect, but it’s the way the first aspect is attempted to be lived contemporarily.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think it always will have to be this way. Mormons also have very strict modesty laws. Their laws also relate to all areas of one&#8217;s life but there is a dress code as well. Their dress code is updated from time to time. It&#8217;s a modern version of modesty. There are some hard and fast rules, but it is not 17th century modesty. It is modern modesty. One who follows their guidelines would certainly be emulating God&#8217;s modesty of hiding greatness behind a veil.</p>
<p>However, if an orthodox Jew would dress in the Mormon way they would probably be shunned by their orthodox Jewish friends and neighbors. It&#8217;s almost certain that they would be chastised by rabbis and modesty activists. But I would venture to guess that they would be modest and they would be satisfying the Godly standard of the Chinuch.</p>
<p>There are two Judaisms. There is the Judaism between Jew and God and there is the Judaism between Jew and fellow Jew. They are not always the same thing.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is a good example of this. One can be dressed very respectfully, modestly, and Godly but still not follow the laws of <i>tznius</i> as they are practiced in orthodox Judaism today. Conversely, one can follow the letter of the law of <i>tznius</i> and be the complete opposite of Godly. We all know this is true.</p>
<p>Maybe, if there is enough demand and enough people who won&#8217;t look down their noses at people with subjective standards of modesty, the first and second aspects of <i>tznius</i> could be reunited. I don&#8217;t expect it to happen quickly, I don&#8217;t even expect it to happen at all. But it is something to think about.</p>
<p>Perhaps there will be some sort of reformation within orthodox Judaism and the standards of <i>tznius</i> will be updated to modern sensibilities. I think guidelines that are similar to the Mormon regulations would be far less criticized than the standards we have today. This, coupled with a severe toning down of <i>tznius</i> rhetoric, blame, and false promises of salvation would completely change the tenor of the <i>tznius</i> conversation. We should be talking about God&#8217;s <i>tznius</i>. The kind of greatness the Chinuch describes is what our goal should be.</p>
<p>At the very least, I think attempting to emulate God in this manner is valuable. It can improve our lives. We can begin to appreciate the wisdom of universal modesty that applies to men and women in all of our lives. Understanding the circumstances that led to <i>tznius</i> regulations in orthodox Judaism today can also soften the challenge of arcane dress codes at least a little bit. But I think the hopeful part of this article is the most important part. Our collective standards might be able to change if we allow them to change. In our hearts we must know that in theory our goal is to be Godly in a way that is not intended nor should it ever be interpreted as a way to control women, burden women with the brunt of dealing with man&#8217;s animalism, some new-agey feminist form of liberation, or the fundamental way women serve God.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is meant to be a way of emulating God. Let’s bring that back and try to end the current trend of fetishizing <i>tznius.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/israel-jerus-285.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7269" alt="israel-jerus-285" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/israel-jerus-285-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>In many ways Mormons are like American Orthodox Jews. We share many values and our lifestyles are very similar. One thing that we share is the emphasis on modesty. The rules of modesty in Mormonism are far less rigid than they are in orthodox Judaism, but they are taken just as seriously. Their rules sound like 20th century rules and ours sound like 16th century rules. All this makes perfect sense considering when our books of law were codified.</p>
<p>One thing Mormons do at the tender age of 19 is they go on Missions. We have <a href="http://chinuch.org/project_seed.php" target="_blank">Project SEED</a> programs. It&#8217;s basically the same idea.</p>
<p>For many young Mormons it is their first real contact with non-Mormons on a regular basis. Obviously this creates new challenges for the missionaries. It seems that dealing with the relative immodesty of non-Mormons when compared with what they are accustomed to is a particularly difficult challenge.</p>
<p>Mormons are expected to be chaste in every possible way and this can be particularly difficult for young men.</p>
<p>A young man on a Mission where clothing is worn sparingly writes of his personal struggles.<span id="more-7268"></span> It is fascinating to hear him talk in Mormon terms about struggles that he shares with young Yeshiva students. What is most interesting is where he takes the article. I recommend reading the article for its content but also to compare it with our values and terminology.</p>
<p>He wants things to change. In short, he uses anecdotal evidence, scientific studies, and logic to argue that the overemphasis on modesty has the opposite of its intended effect. Instead of making it easier for men it makes it harder for men. Further, it does not ensure that women are thought of in the purest of terms. Finally, it reinforces unfortunate stereotypes about pleasure and intimacy that can have negative consequences later on in life and throughout marriage.</p>
<p>He concludes that it is time to rethink old ideas about sexuality in the Mormon Church.</p>
<p>I sense that a similar conversation is brewing in the orthodox Jewish community. All the talk of Tznius is having an opposite of its desired effect on so many people in our community. It has gone from reasonable to extreme to laughable. Has it even helped anything? What are the tangible benefits of increased modesty to an absurd degree?</p>
<p>Science and soft science have a lot to say about how we are affected by what we see and what we wear. Are we interested in what they say? Is there a way to bridge the gap between the two?</p>
<p>Will a budding Torah scholar with Yeshiva bona fides write an article like this? Are we ready for this conversation?</p>
<p>These are tough questions but I think we will be doing a world of good by trying to answer them.</p>

<p>Historically, these beliefs were kept within the bounds of the religious group and no one was the wiser. By and large, people didn&#8217;t have access to religious texts and codes of other religions. There was little interaction between people of various religions. Abhorrent beliefs were safe.</p>
<p>But things have changed. The international community has become like a small village. We all know each other&#8217;s business. Television and the Internet have made us all virtual neighbors. Enemies used to be neighbors or neighboring territories. Now enemies can be anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Last week, one abhorrent belief of Mormonism was exposed (again).<span id="more-5188"></span> I don&#8217;t mean to pick on Mormonism, we will get to Judaism soon. And while on the topic of Mormons, let&#8217;s not forget the comment made by a presidential candidate aide dismissing all Mormons as non-Christians. Anyway, the Church of Latter Day Saints has a practice of <a href="http://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&amp;sourceId=1ec52f2324d98010VgnVCM1000004d82620a____" target="_blank">baptizing all sorts of people who are dead</a>. They don&#8217;t deny it. In fact you can read several fascinating article on the LDS website about the practice. They base it on sources in the Old and New <em>(sic)</em> Testament and in their eyes it is a beautiful honor to the deceased. When it was discovered (again) that they were posthumously baptizing Holocaust victims, outrage ensued. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/elie-wiesel-calls-on-mitt-romney-to-make-mormon-church-stop-proxy-baptisms-of-jews/2012/02/14/gIQAZK6bER_story.html" target="_blank">Elie Wiesel and the Wiesenthal Center demanded that they stop and that they apologize.</a> Somehow Mitt Romney was being asked to apologize as well.</p>
<p>I found myself conflicted. On one hand I have always had a distaste for baptism for the dead. It is the reason I won&#8217;t use a site like Ancestry.com which is owned by the Mormon Church and the data is mined for baptism purposes. I find the practice abhorrent. It really is a little twisted to think about baptizing people who were killed simply because they were Jews! On the other hand I also find it silly and meaningless. Why should it bother me if they say some magic words that in my opinion accomplish absolutely nothing? It&#8217;s a tough call. It&#8217;s certainly not as bad as Elie Wiesel thinks.</p>
<p>Either way, the issue is really what should the Mormon Church do about its abhorrent belief that they should baptize dead non-Mormons? They think they are doing a good and moral act. To outsiders it is offensive. What to do?</p>
<p>Closer to home, Judaism has its fair share of abhorrent beliefs. Most of them no longer apply. Most of them have either been reinterpreted or require circumstances that are not currently at play. Some people want to accelerate those circumstances and create the environment that would allow and require those abhorrent beliefs be put into practice.</p>
<p>Sometimes religious people have abhorrent beliefs or ideas that are not essential to their religion. They may think that these are religious rules, but they are not. These are social conventions that are more likely the result of years of persecution, insularity, and fear as opposed to drawn from religious texts. But the lines are rarely so clear. More recent texts are likely to mix the two and then provide sources for new abhorrent beliefs that are not intrinsic to the religion.</p>
<p>What does the orthodox Jew do about these beliefs?</p>
<p>There are two approaches that I know. The first is based on a famous thought experiment called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthyphro_dilemma" target="_blank">Euthyphro Dilemma</a>. In short, the idea is that if God commands something it is intrinsically moral. Thus, the social conventions that may make a belief seem abhorrent are really false and true morality only exists in God&#8217;s commandments. This has appeal but it is a tough pill to swallow. Are we really comfortable with Divinely commanded genocide? I&#8217;d rather not have to make that choice. It also seems incongruous that God would create humans who would develop over time into beings whose sense of morality is at odds with God&#8217;s word.</p>
<p>The second approach is to interpret abhorrent beliefs in a way that makes them less abhorrent. This doesn&#8217;t always work, and could rankle the feathers of the more traditionalist among us, but when it works, it works well. For example, there is a commandment to hate (and kill) Amalek. This seems at odds with human perception of fairness and compassion. Over on Hirhurim, R&#8217; Norman Lamm is quoted and I direct your attention there (<a href="http://torahmusings.com/2012/02/when-hatred-is-a-mitzvah/" target="_blank">Hirhurim</a>) as his answer is not relevant to this discussion.</p>
<p>Which all leads to the most fascinating question of all: When these abhorrent beliefs are exposed or shared with outsiders and they make us look bad or old-fashioned, or immoral, or bigoted in the eyes of those outsiders is that a desecration of God&#8217;s Name?</p>
<p>Maimonides codifies several examples of kiddush and chillul Hashem in Chapter 5 of Yesodei HaTorah. None of them really concern the opinions of outsiders about our beliefs. They all concern how we act. There are times we must die for the sake of God&#8217;s commandments and there are other instances where our status as Jews or scholars requires us to act in a refined manner. Failure to do so is a chillul Hashem. The principle of chillul Hashem as it relates to how others think of our beliefs does not enter the conversation.</p>
<p>I think we can safely say that exposing what the Torah says cannot be considered a chillul Hashem.</p>
<p>However, this does not account for social conventions, prejudices, and anti-social ideas that emanate from insularity or superstition that are confused with religious fervor or beliefs. I think it is fair to say that exposing a non-essential abhorrent belief might be a chillul Hashem. That is unfortunately the inevitable result of the new global community. So what is the appropriate response when these secrets are revealed (as they were in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/20/unorthodox-book-review-and-analysis/">Unorthodox</a>)?</p>
<p>The solution is not to cry chillul Hashem and force the issue back into the dark hole from where it came. The solution is to eradicate non-essential abhorrent beliefs. There is little we can do about our essential beliefs that don&#8217;t jive with modern sensibilities. We have to hope that others recognize that every religion and even many non-religions have abhorrent beliefs and so long as they don&#8217;t cause any harm, they can be ignored. Much in the same way as I can ignore baptism of the dead. But if there are non-essential abhorrent beliefs in our community that can be changed or removed, I think it is wise and prudent to do all that we can to eliminate these items from our community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/salt-lake-mormon-temple.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4833" title="salt-lake-mormon-temple" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/salt-lake-mormon-temple-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>A couple of weeks ago the New York Times featured a Fashion and Style article that caught my attention. I never read that section. But the headline grabbed me because it was not really about fashion or style. It was about religion and Mormons in particular.</p>
<p>The article talked about modern Mormons trying to fit in with their non-Mormon social circles.</p>
<p>I have a &#8220;thing&#8221; with Mormons.</p>
<p>Of all the religions in the world, I think the closest religion to Orthodox Judaism in many respects is Mormonism. I don&#8217;t mean in a theoligical sense. I mean in a practical, real world sense.</p>
<p>The kinds of challenges and successes that Mormons have resemble that of orthodox Jews. Both are minority religions in a predominantly &#8220;Traditional Christian&#8221; country. Both give their adherents opportunities to thrive in the modern world. But both also have a bit of a tradition of reluctance to modernity. So it is striking that both have embraced modernity in their own ways.<span id="more-4832"></span></p>
<p>Brigham Young University is a Mormon college. It strikes me as being very similar to Yeshiva University or even my alma mater, Ner Israel. I wrote about that sometime a while back: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/02/the-byu-honor-code-and-me/">The BYU Honor Code and Me</a></p>
<p>To me the article in the NY Times sounded a lot like Modern Orthodox Judaism. Young people who aspire to achieve success in the secular world who are also extremely restricted by their religion within that secular world. The restrictions are different between but they are similar as well.</p>
<p>For example: Clothing. Mormons are required to wear modest clothing on the outside but also a religious article of clothing on the inside. Orthodox Jews have the same. Different in the details but similar in spirit.</p>
<p>Another example: Social Drinking. Alcohol plays a huge social role. Parties serve alcohol, bars are frequent places of meeting and Mormons are forbidden from drinking alcohol altogether. Orthodox Jews are allowed to drink. But there are many restrictions that prevent (perhaps by design) absolute fraternization with non-Jews. Wine must be kosher. Mixed drinks must contain only kosher ingredients. Social drinking can be cumbersome.</p>
<p>I think these sort of parallels reflect a greater parallel between the two religions. This all leads me to one important thing to consider.</p>
<p>We live in a country that is predominately Christian. By and large, Christians have been wonderful friends to the Jews and particularly to Israel. But there is always the sneaking suspicion that we are still &#8220;the other&#8221;. I know I sense it. Similarly, Mormons have also been subjected to feeling like &#8220;the other&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am not criticizing anyone for making Jews or Mormons feel like &#8220;the other&#8221;. I am just saying that it exists and sometimes it rears its ugly head.</p>
<p>Rick Perry&#8217;s campaign has managed to make both Jews and Mormons feel significantly like &#8220;the other&#8221;. First Jews at his Prayer Rally and then Mormons when a member of his staff said some not-nice things about Mormons.</p>
<p>So Mormons, we know how you feel, in more ways than one&#8230;</p>
