I haven&#8217;t seen the video of the planes crashing into the towers. Nor have I seen the video of desperate people in the towers jumping out their windows. I don&#8217;t believe I have seen the video of the towers crashing down either.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wtc1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4601" title="wtc1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/wtc1-300x218.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="218" /></a>That&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen the video of the planes crashing into the towers. Nor have I seen the video of desperate people in the towers jumping out their windows. I don&#8217;t believe I have seen the video of the towers crashing down either.</p>
<p>On 9/11/01 I was in yeshiva. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/09/11/911-reflections/">9/11 Reflections</a>) I had no access to TV or the Internet. My entire perception of the events was completely formed by what I heard on the radio and what I saw in the newspaper.</p>
<p>But I could have looked it up on youtube or seen it on any of the news channels if I really wanted to. I guess I didn&#8217;t.<span id="more-4600"></span></p>
<p>In my mind&#8217;s eye, those moments are moments of death. Those are holy milliseconds. The point in time where people became heroes. I don&#8217;t think I can handle witnessing the deaths of thousands of people. Real people living their last moments is too painful for me to endure.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, those moments are private moments.</p>
<p>9|11 is wrought with emotion. But nothing pierces the heart like seeing lives cut short. Way too short.</p>
<p>Of all the 9|11 moments, my most visceral reaction is to Flight 93. I cried when I saw the movie trailer for the feature film. I cry whenever I hear accounts of the heroic men and women who stormed the cockpit. But above all, the people who talked to their loved ones via cell phone and talked them through their final moments are the ones whose stories overtake me emotionally.[1]
<p>The second I hear any of their stories my mind starts racing. And it hurts. To think, you know you are going to die, you know that you will never see your loved one again, you know you are going to be a hero and you know that the world will continue without you. Facing one&#8217;s mortality in such a profound way blow my mind.</p>
<p>I think that is why I don&#8217;t want to see those videos. Facing mortality is difficult. Especially so when the result is already known to the observer. I prefer to remember those lost but without seeing them in their most private intimate encounter with their own mortality. It feels like an invasion of their privacy.</p>
<p>Giving them their privacy in their final moments is my tribute to them.</p>
<p><em>May their memories be a blessing.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
[1] <em>I like to think this moment was the inspiration for the first scene in Star Trek (2009). That remains one of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen in a movie or TV show.</em></p>

<p>This photo has been sitting on my desktop since 9|11 2010. I had been saving it for today.</p>
<p>I love this photo. To me, it exemplifies the perfect and most appropriate reaction to tragedy. In place of the Twin Towers destroyed by evil, are two beams of light soaring high into the night.</p>
<p>The physical towers are gone. But their light, their non-physical presence lives on. The edifice lives on and the people live on. Perhaps most importantly, what they stood for lives on.</p>
<p>Light also perfectly embodies what those towers stood for. Light shows the way. Light illuminates. Light is good. The American society that the terrorists abhorred was the America of progress, modernity, diversity and goodness. The terror is darkness. It only works when it cannot be detected until it is too late.</p>
<p>The light of the Twin Towers and America lives on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/9-11-01-logo-300x285.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4592" title="9-11-01-logo-300x285" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/9-11-01-logo-300x285.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="285" /></a>There are seemingly infinite ways to commemorate 9|11.</p>
<p>I plan several posts over the weekend to express my feelings, memories and hope for this important day in American history.</p>
<p>The first of these posts illustrates to me that 9|11 really has two components. The national component and the personal. On a national level we were thrust into mourning and war. It is a war that does not seem likely to end anytime soon. Every day without a terrorist attack is a day that we have won that war. But that war also carries a very significant price tag. Lives, dollars, foreign relations and other corners of life have suffered. In the end, we can only hope the sacrifices are worthwhile.</p>
<p>The more compelling component, that is less widely discussed is the personal component. By personal, I mean the effects of the tragedy on individuals and their subsequent stories of survival, rebuilding and healing.</p>
<p>The nexus of the national and personal stories is found in the media. The media is in a position to nationalize the personal stories. I find the various ways of expressing these stories absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>I have chosen 4 different media outlets to illustrate this.<span id="more-4588"></span></p>
<p><strong>ESPN</strong></p>
<p>On ESPN, the 9|11 narrative is told from the perspective of a sports fan. Great moments in sports led up to September 11, 2001. Agassi v. Sampras, Bonds hitting #61, 62 and 63 (of 73), Michael Jordon unretired. These seemed like important moments at the time. Nothing compared to 9|11.</p>
<p>Sports also played a prominent role in our healing. Getting back to business and playing those games told us and our enemies that they cannot destroy America and our vibrant culture. Sports offered an escape when we needed it most.</p>
<p>ESPN&#8217;s article is a must read for any sports fan.</p>
<p>Link: <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/6937733/sports-sept-11-2001-espn-magazine" target="_blank">ESPN</a></p>
<p><strong>People Magazine</strong></p>
<p>I am NOT a reader of People. I noticed their cover story at CVS and I found it very interesting. The magazine chronicles the lives of children born to a parent who died on 9|11.</p>
<p>What a powerful lens through which to see the tragedy of it all. This is as personal as it gets. Yet, we can relate to it all through these almost 10 year old children. It also reminds us that we have a lot to live for. The next generation of America needed us to snap out of our funk.</p>
<p>I have not read the article, though I did see a video on the article and here is the short synopsis on <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20524377,00.html" target="_blank">People.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Slate</strong></p>
<p>In its inimitable way, Slate takes us back to when we had the Twin Towers. We see the Twin Towers through the camera lens and we are shown pictures where the Towers look small. They loom in the distance. The slideshow is called Tiny Towers.</p>
<p>To me, these photos are powerful and personal. They remind us that the Towers were part of the tapestry of New York life. Always there. Always tall.</p>
<p>But seeing them looking so small also reminds me that everything is a matter of perspective. Sometimes things can look so large. Larger than life. But when we pull back, the same towering ideas can become much smaller.</p>
<p>Our national mourning was so intimidating. But as we pulled back, we gained the perspective needed to heal.</p>
<p>Check out the photos here: <a href="http://www.slate.com/slideshow/arts/tiny-towers/">Slate</a></p>
<p><strong>CNN</strong></p>
<p>At the gym I saw a documentary being promoted on CNN. The idea of the documentary is to take all the details, all the footnotes of history and have them tell the stories. We hear from the ticketing agent who sold Mohammed Atta his ticket. We hear about all the minutia of the day and events that led up to the day. We hear from everyday people. It&#8217;s personal.</p>
<p>These details of everyday life give the event a more personal nature. They humanize it into a seemingly random selection of moments. But we know how profound those moments became.</p>
<p>This perspective reminds all of us that our acts and thoughts matter. Each moment can and does make a tremendous difference. Sometimes we can see it right away and other times we cannot. But it is there.</p>
<p>See it here: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/09/06/september.11.footnotes/index.html" target="_blank">The Footnotes of September 11</a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>In the end, the collective message is that in America we celebrate diversity. We celebrate different points of view. We challenge ourselves to have a voice and to hear the voice of others. Seeing just four of the myriad ways to remember on this 9|11 affirms the splendor and beauty of America.</p>
<p>On a national scale we may never completely win this war.</p>
<p>On a personal level we won a long time ago. We won on September 12, 2001 &#8211; the very next day. By continuing to do and believe in what make America great, each of us, as individuals has defeated each and all of the terrorists who changed it all 10 years ago.</p>

<p>Here is the ad:</p>

<p>I find the ad obscene. It is provocative, misleading and presumptuous all in one.</p>
<p>However, as much as the ICC has a right to exist, this ad has a right to exist as well. The same laws that protect the ICC, protect this obscene ad. (Note: If the ad was so incendiary as to cause violence it would NOT be protected by the constitution, in which case it would lose my meaningless approval as well)</p>
<p>The irony is that the folks behind the ad can hide behind the 1st Amendment but would deny the same rights to the Cordoba Center.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Cordoba-House1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2691" title="Cordoba House" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Cordoba-House-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear: </em><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/08/islamaphobia-and-cordoba-house.html"><em>Islamaphobia and Cordoba House</em></a></p>
<p>It seems that the Cordoba House in downtown Manhattan has cleared a major hurdle by winning a 9-0 vote of the Landmarks Conservation Commission. (NY Times <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/mosque-near-ground-zero-clears-key-hurdle/?hp" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>Conservatives and liberals seem to be at loggerheads on this particular issue. Sarah Palin made headlines with her plea that the center be blocked and fellow right wing pundits have expressed their distaste to the center. They feel it disgraces the deceased by glorifying what they believe to be the religion that caused the tragedy at Ground Zero almost 9 years ago. Liberals, on the other hand, see the center as an olive branch to Islam and think the center glorifies America, not the dangerous form of Islamic Fundamentalism that took down the Twin Towers, 3000 victims and the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say whether the center is an affront or not.<span id="more-2689"></span> That&#8217;s because it varies with each person. Everyone is free to react as they choose. I can&#8217;t say one side is right and one side is wrong.</p>
<p>What I can say is that the center has a bad marketing plan.</p>
<p>The center is not a mosque. It is a massive cultural center. There is a sanctuary planned but it is a minor part of a broader institution. An institution that, according to their website attempts to bring the gap between Islam and the West. An institution that also fights for women&#8217;s rights and opportunitities within Islam. In fact, if we are to believe the Cordoba website, it is exactly what Americans (especially Conservatives) should be supporting.</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cordoba House is a Muslim-led project which will build a world-class facility that promotes tolerance, reflecting the rich diversity of New York City.  The center will be community-driven, serving as a platform for inter-community gatherings and cooperation at all levels, providing a space for all New Yorkers to enjoy.</p>
<p>This proposed project is about promoting integration, tolerance of difference and community cohesion through arts and culture.  Cordoba House will provide a place where individuals, regardless of their backgrounds, will find a center of learning, art and culture; and most importantly, a center guided by Islamic values in their truest form &#8211; compassion, generosity, and respect for all.</p>
<p>The site will contain tremendous amounts of resources that otherwise would not exist in Lower Manhattan; a 500-seat auditorium, swimming pool, art exhibition spaces, bookstores, restaurants &#8211; all these services would form a cultural nexus for a region of New York City that, as it continues to grow, requires the sort of hub that Cordoba House will provide.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why call themselves a mosque? Bad marketing.</p>
<p>The center is not &#8220;at Ground Zero&#8221; either. It is 2 blocks away. If you&#8217;ve never been to Manhattan you can&#8217;t appreciate how FAR part 2 blocks in NYC are. Two blocks in Manhattan is very far. It is a few minutes walk and more importantly, it is certainly not within the line of sight. They should be saying that their center is a few minutes walk from Ground Zero. Not &#8220;at Ground Zero&#8221;.</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ch_map1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2690" title="Cordoba Location" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ch_map1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>So the Mosque at Ground Zero is neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero. It is an Islamic Center in Downtown Manhattan. Is that still as offensive to those who oppose the center?</p>
<p>The only reasonable explanation for opposition that remains is conspiracy.</p>
<p>In other words, the website is a sham. The REAL purpose of Cordoba House is to spread Fundamental Islam and serve as a springboard for the continued spread of Islam in their quest for world dominance. This is Islamaphobia.</p>
<p>There are people who believe this to be the case. I do not.</p>
<p>If you are asking me, which you aren&#8217;t, I say support the Cordoba House and the brand of Islam they espouse and perhaps get involved a see it for yourself if you are not convinced. Working together will go a long way.</p>

<p>9/11/01</p>
<p>Much has changed in the world since then and much has changed in my life. I got married. I have two sons. I am a Rabbi. I am a Law Student. I am a blogger.</p>
<p>For me, 9/11 was a signpost along the way. My last few months of bachelorhood were marked by the aftermath of 9/11.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to that day.<span id="more-1143"></span></p>
<p>I had the flu and was stuck in bed. I got up late and hobbled to the bathroom. Some guy says to me &#8220;they got the second tower&#8221;, I had no idea what he was talking about. I overheard someone say to turn on the radio. When I turned on the radio my heart dropped.</p>
<p>For my friends and I, studying at Yeshiva of Far Rockaway, we were so close to Ground Zero we could see smoke from our dorm.</p>
<p>The pain of the thousands of victims was felt by an entire nation. We connected with each other in a way that only war can unite people. We were united by a common enemy but we picked each other up in every way possible. It went beyond 9/11 and it became about being human. Eventually, humans will cease to get along, but it sure was nice while it lasted.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most emotional part of the entire 9/11 attack and recovery was the camaraderie that it created. I know that I feel a similar camaraderie when I visit Israel. I know everyone there is family. My brothers and sisters surround me when I go to Israel. Post 9/11 New York felt very much the same.</p>
<p>Around that time the band U2 had made a comeback. Their mid to late 90&#8242;s albums all flopped. They returned to their roots with &#8220;All That You Can&#8217;t Leave Behind&#8221; in October 2000. The album had astronomic appeal and was just as popular in September 2001 as it was when it was released a year earlier. The feel of the album was soulful, inspirational rock. It worked.</p>
<p>In October of 2001 U2 had a concert in Madison Square Garden. When u2 sang their Grammy winning song &#8220;Walk On&#8221; they pulled off the most powerful moment I have ever seen on video. The song message is to move on from pain and hurt and to take the lessons of tragedy and difficulty and use them to make our lives better. To &#8220;Walk On&#8221;. With names of all the victims scrolling in the background, U2 called a contingency of NYC Firefighters onto the stage for a heroes welcome.</p>
<p>I am not 100% certain why, but the video makes me cry every time and even as I type this blog post my eyes fill with tears.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Perhaps you will feel the same way. (The first 4:30 is the song, and the FDNY comes on towards the end). Thanks to Bill Simmons aka The Sports Guy for <a href="http://twitter.com/sportsguy33/status/3914950307" target="_blank">tweeting the link</a> to this video.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">I would like to personally thanks those heroes who saved lives and my thoughts are with all those who lost friends and family on that tragic day 8 years ago.</p>
