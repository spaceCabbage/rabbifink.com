				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>There is no more perfect secular holiday than Thanksgiving. It has a universal message, warm traditions, and is versatile enough to work to all kinds of people. I think it&#8217;s especially wonderful that so many Jewish people, including Orthodox Jews, have embraced Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>On a Jewish level there is nothing more basic than giving thanks. Gratitude begins the moment we arise with Modeh Ani. But that is a private declaration of appreciation to God. Thanksgiving gives us an opportunity to build greater gratitude with our friends and family. It&#8217;s a time to publicly give thanks to God and all the people in our lives who deserves appreciation. It&#8217;s true that we must be thankful everyday, but setting aside one day a year as a communal expression of appreciation is a wise tradition.<span id="more-7907"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7908" alt="The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961-600x382.jpg" width="360" height="229" /></a>Further, Jews need to be thankful simply for the existence of Thanksgiving. It is a uniquely American holiday and we have been blessed in America, flourishing and growing in unprecedented numbers. Thanksgiving celebrates America. We must celebrate America too. Indeed, we must be thankful for Thanksgiving itself.</p>
<p>Most of all, Thanksgiving gives us a splendid opportunity to share in an American tradition with our fellow Americans. So many other American traditions are antithetical to Torah and Judaism. We can&#8217;t in good conscience join in those celebrations. Christmas? Drinking and debauchery on New Years? Easter? as well as several other hallowed American traditions are not our traditions. But this one, Thanksgiving, that&#8217;s right in our wheelhouse. It gives us the chance to join together with the rest of America and in unison say thank you. That in itself is worth the effort to participate in the holiday. Although we don&#8217;t primarily associate as Americans, rather we are Jews first, it is a powerful declaration of unity to connect with 300 million Americans from diverse backgrounds, with a plurality of beliefs to celebrate Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>This year it&#8217;s even more fun as we can merge and meld some of our Chanukah traditions with Thanksgiving. The connections between the two holidays are self evident. Both were belated Sukkos style celebrations giving thanks to God. They are like siblings from the same parents.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s enjoy the holiday and be proud to live in a country that makes a holiday out of giving thanks, just like us.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Chayei Sara<br />
Ever Thankful</h2>
<p>One can help but be amazed by the amazing lessons for life taught to us by our avos and recorded for posterity as a <em>limud</em> for us throughout Sefer Bereishis. One phenomenal lesson is taught and reinforced again in Parshas Chaya Sara.</p>
<p>As Avraham laden with grief upon the passage of his beloved wife, Sarah Imanu, heads to Chevron to purchase to secure a burial place for Sarah Imanu. Filled with grief he approaches Bnei Cheis seeking to purchase the Mearas Hamachpayla. He explains his plight and the Bnei Cheis say to him, do not worry no one here will hold back in providing you a burial plot for your deceased. Efron too, the leader of the Bnei Cheis tells him<em> hasadeh nasatee</em> <em>lach</em>, the plot is yours<em>…k’vor meisecha</em>. Avraham’s response to their words and seeming benevolence is (23:12) <em>vayishtachu Avraham lifnei am haaretz</em>, Avraham bowed to the people.</p>
<p>The Medrish Raba uses this episode to teach a halacha and says <em>mikan lomdim shemodim al besurah tova</em>-we are supposed to give thanks on hearing good tidings. Interestingly, Avraham had not yet finished negotiating with Efron nor had he yet aquired the Mearas Hamachpayla still the very fact that he heard they were receptive to his idea was enough for him to bow and give thanks. Avraham was so conscious of expressing appreciation for everything that transpired that even in his grief while still an <em>onain</em> he stopped and gave thanks with the optimistic belief that things were going to work out.</p>
<p>This notion is so vital to the lessons of Parshas Chayei Sara that it is repeated again to let us know how crucial this attitude is to our outlook.<span id="more-4850"></span> Later on in the parsha we learn of Eliezer <em>eved</em> Avraham’s search for a wife for Yitzchok. He offers a tefilah to Hashem and asks that a test of a maiden giving him and his camels water be a siman min hashamayim of the perfect match for Yitzchok. Immediately upon concluding his supplication the famous story of Rivka at the well unfolds. After she finished watering his camels, Eliezer asks her- “who is your father?”, Rivka responds that she is the daughter of Besuel and she invites him to her father’s home. The Torah then declares, <em>vayikod haish vayishtachavu l’Hashem</em>. Eliezer bowed down to express appreciation to Hakadosh Baruch Hu for seeing his prayers beginning to be answered. On this pasuk the Medrish also says <em>mikan shemodim al besura tova</em>. Though similar to the story of Avraham and Bnei Cheis there are some slight differences which we must learn from. By Avraham Avinu it says not that he bowed to Hashem, just that he bowed. Eliezer on the other hand the Torah specifies he bowed to Hakadosh Baruch Hu. The underling message is powerful. Hodaah is due to people and to Hashem Yisborach for all the good that takes place in our life…even the good things that have not yet happened!</p>
<p>Moreover, there is never a moment in time when expressing <em>hodaah</em> should be difficult. Avraham needed to bury Sarah-he was in mourning, but he found the time to be grateful. Eliezer in a foreign country with a mission to hastly accomplish took the time to be grateful. He wasn’t in too much of a hurry to say thanks to Hashem Yisbarach for putting him in the right place at the right time. In addition, we must also explore the context of these declarations of hodaah. Avraham Avinu took the time to express appreciation at the end of Sarah sojourn on this earth as he himself too entered his twilight years having been blessed bakol. Eliezer on the other hand expresses hodaah at the prospect of having found a wife for Yitzchok who would now be able to begin living his life <em>beshleimus</em> with his <em>bashert</em> Rivka Imanu. It is never too early and never too late to be thankful.</p>
<p>These lessons should not be lost upon us. So many of us feel the pain of loss and bereft of comfort from recent tragedies that have plagued our people. Nevertheless, we must reach down deep beyond our suffering and follow the example of Avraham Avinu. We must find our way to look beyond the pain and tragedy and be thankful for even a <em>besura tova</em>, a seemingly little thing that has not yet come to fruition, even the grief is still fresh upon us. In that zechus of finding the way to be maker tov to the Ribono Shel Olam like Avraham <em>beshaas evel</em>, may we be <em>zoche</em> to have the opportunity to be maker tov to Hakadosh Baruch Hu like Eliezer eved Avraham, out of simcha and joy of <em>kol sasson vekol simcha kal chason vekol kallah kol omrim hodu es Hashem…ki leolam chasdo</em>.</p>

<p>It deserves to be shared.</p>
<p>In 2007, a lawyer named John Kralik had a tough year. To begin 2008 he resolved to write hand-written thank you notes to anyone who gave him a Christmas gift. He wrote one personal note per day. After that he continued by writing personal thank you notes to anyone who deserved appreciation. People like his barista, son, co-workers and anyone else he could think to thank. He wrote one note every single day for the entire year.</p>
<p><span id="more-3557"></span>An important part of Kralik&#8217;s plan was to write the notes, as opposed to sending emails. He felt that the personal touch of hand writing as well as permanence of the paper notes was key. Emails are like noise. They are read, deleted or archived and never seen again. However, people do save real notes and they continue to impact their recipient long after the note has been written.</p>
<p>The project has been turned into a book.</p>
<p>I may pick up a copy. If you want to check out the book <a style="border: none;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401324053?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1401324053" target=" mce_src=">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Kralik is onto something. Recognizing and appreciating everything and everyone in one&#8217;s life is a strong step toward happiness. In Ethics of our Fathers, our sages teach us &#8220;Who is happy? He who is satisfied with his lot&#8221;. The idea is simple really. When one is happy with what one has, one can find happiness. But so long as one does not appreciate what one has, how can they be happy?</p>
<p>I wish I had the fortitude to do what Kralik has done. Maybe one day.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I guess it would be prudent to pay extra attention to those who deserves our appreciation.</p>
<p>To start with, thank you Cassie for linking this article on your Facebook page!</p>
