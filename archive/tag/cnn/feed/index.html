				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6945" alt="130415160947-boston-marathon-explosion-08-horizontal-large-gallery" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/130415160947-boston-marathon-explosion-08-horizontal-large-gallery-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" />Yesterday, on Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101489314937755" target="_blank">I posted the iconic photo of the 78 year old man</a> in an orange shirt surrounded by police officers with smoke billowing in the background just after the explosion at the Boston Marathon. I took notice of the Israeli flag in the background. It was hard to miss the flag through the smoke and it meant something to me that the flag was so prominent in the photo.</p>
<p>One fellow left a comment on the photo with a link to a CNN version of the photo. In the CNN version the Israeli flag cannot be seen. The implication was that the photo was edited to remove the Israeli flag.</p>
<p>I did a little digging and I discovered that CNN got the photo from Getty Images. I hunted for the photo on Getty Images and found the second photo on their site. At first I was incensed. I even put up a blog post criticizing Getty Images (completely against my nature) for what I thought was scrubbing the photo.</p>
<p>I never looked at the photos side by side. I last saw the original photo last night and I first saw the second photo this morning. They were similar enough that it looked suspicious. But once I posted the photos one above the other I noticed, as did several intrepid readers, that they were <em>not the same photo.</em> The photographer took more than one photo as he got closer to the scene. In one photo the Israeli flag is visible, in the other it is not. But in the second photo, the American flag is visible. That&#8217;s clearly a better choice for this particular tragedy.</p>
<p>Once I realized my mistake I removed the blog post.<span id="more-6951"></span> This despite the fact that I can guarantee that post would have reached 50,000 views within a couple hours. The conspiracy theorists would have loved and shared it to all their fellow conspiracy theorist friends and the realists would have come to see the post and yell at me (and them). But it&#8217;s not about views. It&#8217;s about truth and honest discussion. So I took it down.</p>
<p>Of course, there are people who will try to make this all about Israel and media bias. I almost did too. But if it&#8217;s simply not true. These people will post cropped versions of the photos to make them look like the same photo. Shame on them. It is irresponsible, whiny, and even dangerous to invent media conspiracies against Israel.</p>
<p>However, there are some media outlets that used the original photo but cropped all the flags out of the photo. I think that is acceptable. The flags are cool, but distract from the important part of the photo.</p>
<p>Today is Yom HaAztmaut. We should be celebrating Israel, not complaining about manufactured controversies. I apologize for almost jumping on this bandwagon. I am glad I got off right away.</p>
<p>Here is a PDF of my original post that has been taken down: <em>(It&#8217;s fairly obvious that these are two different photos)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CNN-Breaking-News-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5738" title="CNN-Breaking-News-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CNN-Breaking-News-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180" /></a>It was only a matter of time. The national media has picked up the most important story in the orthodox Jewish community of our day. Nothing compares to this. Not Internet bans or Siyum celebrations or kosher hot dogs. This is THE issue of our time.</p>
<p>CNN does a superficial but somewhat thorough and honest segment on abuse in the chasidic community.</p>
<p>I have embedded the report below. You can watch it, share it, and cry for the victims.</p>
<p>I will just make several bullet points:<span id="more-5737"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The segment is not sensationalist or riddled with half-truths. It is honest and straightforward.</li>
<li>Denial is a powerful drug.</li>
<li>I honestly believe that Hynes is not &#8220;protecting abusers&#8221; for the sake of votes. I think he can&#8217;t prosecute without witnesses and he needs cooperation from victims to prosecute. (I wrote about that here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</li>
<li>One in five being abused is a number that is not scientific but is very possible. One in five thousand would be enough to push us to deal with the issue. One in five is a number that demands immediate and powerful action.</li>
<li>The intimidation of victims and their families should warrant its own segment. Protecting abusers and sacrificing victims is not just heartless and stupid, it compounds the effects of abuse by giving victims the right to think that they are sacrifices and I believe can be linked to victim suicide.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s obviously not just in the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish communities that abuse occurs, but the approach to dealing with abuse is the main difference between the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish community and the rest of the world. We are not equipped to deal with it internally even if we admit that we have a problem. How could we be?</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/9-11-01-logo-300x285.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4592" title="9-11-01-logo-300x285" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/9-11-01-logo-300x285.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="285" /></a>There are seemingly infinite ways to commemorate 9|11.</p>
<p>I plan several posts over the weekend to express my feelings, memories and hope for this important day in American history.</p>
<p>The first of these posts illustrates to me that 9|11 really has two components. The national component and the personal. On a national level we were thrust into mourning and war. It is a war that does not seem likely to end anytime soon. Every day without a terrorist attack is a day that we have won that war. But that war also carries a very significant price tag. Lives, dollars, foreign relations and other corners of life have suffered. In the end, we can only hope the sacrifices are worthwhile.</p>
<p>The more compelling component, that is less widely discussed is the personal component. By personal, I mean the effects of the tragedy on individuals and their subsequent stories of survival, rebuilding and healing.</p>
<p>The nexus of the national and personal stories is found in the media. The media is in a position to nationalize the personal stories. I find the various ways of expressing these stories absolutely fascinating.</p>
<p>I have chosen 4 different media outlets to illustrate this.<span id="more-4588"></span></p>
<p><strong>ESPN</strong></p>
<p>On ESPN, the 9|11 narrative is told from the perspective of a sports fan. Great moments in sports led up to September 11, 2001. Agassi v. Sampras, Bonds hitting #61, 62 and 63 (of 73), Michael Jordon unretired. These seemed like important moments at the time. Nothing compared to 9|11.</p>
<p>Sports also played a prominent role in our healing. Getting back to business and playing those games told us and our enemies that they cannot destroy America and our vibrant culture. Sports offered an escape when we needed it most.</p>
<p>ESPN&#8217;s article is a must read for any sports fan.</p>
<p>Link: <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/6937733/sports-sept-11-2001-espn-magazine" target="_blank">ESPN</a></p>
<p><strong>People Magazine</strong></p>
<p>I am NOT a reader of People. I noticed their cover story at CVS and I found it very interesting. The magazine chronicles the lives of children born to a parent who died on 9|11.</p>
<p>What a powerful lens through which to see the tragedy of it all. This is as personal as it gets. Yet, we can relate to it all through these almost 10 year old children. It also reminds us that we have a lot to live for. The next generation of America needed us to snap out of our funk.</p>
<p>I have not read the article, though I did see a video on the article and here is the short synopsis on <a href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20524377,00.html" target="_blank">People.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Slate</strong></p>
<p>In its inimitable way, Slate takes us back to when we had the Twin Towers. We see the Twin Towers through the camera lens and we are shown pictures where the Towers look small. They loom in the distance. The slideshow is called Tiny Towers.</p>
<p>To me, these photos are powerful and personal. They remind us that the Towers were part of the tapestry of New York life. Always there. Always tall.</p>
<p>But seeing them looking so small also reminds me that everything is a matter of perspective. Sometimes things can look so large. Larger than life. But when we pull back, the same towering ideas can become much smaller.</p>
<p>Our national mourning was so intimidating. But as we pulled back, we gained the perspective needed to heal.</p>
<p>Check out the photos here: <a href="http://www.slate.com/slideshow/arts/tiny-towers/">Slate</a></p>
<p><strong>CNN</strong></p>
<p>At the gym I saw a documentary being promoted on CNN. The idea of the documentary is to take all the details, all the footnotes of history and have them tell the stories. We hear from the ticketing agent who sold Mohammed Atta his ticket. We hear about all the minutia of the day and events that led up to the day. We hear from everyday people. It&#8217;s personal.</p>
<p>These details of everyday life give the event a more personal nature. They humanize it into a seemingly random selection of moments. But we know how profound those moments became.</p>
<p>This perspective reminds all of us that our acts and thoughts matter. Each moment can and does make a tremendous difference. Sometimes we can see it right away and other times we cannot. But it is there.</p>
<p>See it here: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/09/06/september.11.footnotes/index.html" target="_blank">The Footnotes of September 11</a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>In the end, the collective message is that in America we celebrate diversity. We celebrate different points of view. We challenge ourselves to have a voice and to hear the voice of others. Seeing just four of the myriad ways to remember on this 9|11 affirms the splendor and beauty of America.</p>
<p>On a national scale we may never completely win this war.</p>
<p>On a personal level we won a long time ago. We won on September 12, 2001 &#8211; the very next day. By continuing to do and believe in what make America great, each of us, as individuals has defeated each and all of the terrorists who changed it all 10 years ago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/md_horiz.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3397" title="myth billboard" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/md_horiz.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>I am fascinated by the battle of the billboards near the Lincoln Tunnel.</p>
<p>The American Atheists, an atheist advocacy group paid $20,000 for a billboard that depicts a classic nativity scene with the text: &#8220;You know its a myth. This season, celebrate reason&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Catholic league has rebutted this sign with a sign of their own: &#8220;You Know It&#8217;s Real: This Season Celebrate Jesus&#8221;. Their billboard came in at $18,500.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the controversy over the bus signs that said: &#8220;There&#8217;s probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life&#8221;. (See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/09/seen-on-a-bus-ad-in-london-theres-probably-no-god-and-humanists/">Seen On A Bus Ad In London: &#8220;There’s Probably No God…&#8221; and Humanists</a>)</p>
<p>This particular controversy is a case where, in my opinion, pretty much everybody is wrong.<br />
<span id="more-3394"></span></p>
<p>First, the atheists say &#8220;You  KNOW it&#8217;s a myth.&#8221; How can one KNOW that something did not happen. It may not have happened and it may have happened. There is little evidence either way. So, it is disingenuous to claim that one can KNOW that it is a myth. And second, even if it IS a myth, that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t true. And third, even if it isn&#8217;t true that doesn&#8217;t mean that the religion has little or no value.</p>
<p>I expect more from atheists. If your platform is reason, you should use it. Don&#8217;t appeal to sensationalist Madison Avenue emotions. If reason is on your side, use it! They claim they are trying to get people to think. Telling people what they know does not get them to think.</p>
<p>The Catholics are no less guilty of overstating their position. &#8220;You KNOW It&#8217;s Real&#8221;? Seriously? Isn&#8217;t much of Catholicism based on FAITH? If it&#8217;s faith, you can&#8217;t know it! Further, if Christmas was about celebrating Jesus, I bet the atheists wouldn&#8217;t mind so much. But Christmas has become a secular day as much, if not more than a religious day.</p>
<p>The symbolism of the holiday are certainly not biblical (perhaps to the exclusion of the nativity scene). Red coats, flying reindeer, trees, ornaments, mistletoe, even gift giving was at one point banned from Christmas. It is hard not to see that the holiday has taken on many non-religious connotations and is mostly celebrated with traditions that are recent additions.</p>
<p>So, are the atheists waging a battle against religion? Or maybe just traditions that have acquired religious meaning? A little bit of both. But I think they have been spurned by the latter more than the former.</p>
<p>And is it so bad to have added all these non-religious customs to a religious holiday? Yes and no. I think that Christmas has become overblown as a non-religious holiday. Its symbolism is entirely anachronistic for a middle eastern holiday. Yes, Christianity began as a middle eastern religion. There is some religion left, but I think for most people, it is <em>almost</em> like Thanksgiving. An agnostic family holiday.</p>
<p>I know that I am torn about these kinds of additions in Judaism. Ashkenazik Jews have many non-essential traditions that give each holiday a certain sense of nostalgia. I don&#8217;t cherish these traditions the same way I cherish the mitzvos of each holiday, but they do mean something. At the very least, they are like an homage to our grandparents. There is meaning there too. But I am careful to distinguish for myself and my family and my congregation that there is a qualitative difference between observing a mitzvah and keeping a tradition.</p>
<p>On Chanukah there are two mitzvahs. They are to light a candle and sing Hallel. Presents, latkes, dreidel, fried foods, dairy foods are all traditions. And they are pretty recent traditions at that. I think it is important to keep that in perspective so as to not allow the non-essential elements of the holidays usurp the true meaning of the holidays. But I also find at least some value and meaning in those traditions that connect us with our past and give us an appreciation for my family&#8217;s heritage.</p>

The Holocaust did not affect Jews in Muslim countries nearly as much as it affected Jews in Christian countries. One has to wonder what happened to Jews in Muslim countries.</p>
<p>My friend <strong>Calvin Ngo</strong> sent this item to me.</p>
<p>CNN has linked to an article about this exhibit in a Jewish Temple about Albanian Muslims who felt a kinship with their neighbor Jews and risked their lives to save them.</p>
<p>The quotes are profound and hopeful.<span id="more-3180"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to share the same faith. You have to respect each other&#8217;s faith&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;Jews are God&#8217;s people like us&#8221;</p>
<p>and more in the video&#8230;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this the way it is supposed to be? People caring for people?</p>
<p>I am hopeful that this exhibit will remind, Jews, Muslims and everyone else that we can and must coexist in a tolerant society.</p>
<p>Hatred is SO 20th Century&#8230;</p>

<img class="size-full wp-image-2751" title="Child Witches in Nigeria" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/child_witches_1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="202" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Child Witches in Nigeria</p></div>
<p>I saw this CNN article on a friend&#8217;s Facebook page.</p>
<p>There is a severe humanitarian crisis in Nigeria. I don&#8217;t know how much we can do to help but I think the crisis is emblematic of social issues in our culture as well.</p>
<p>Innocent children are being physically abused, even tortured or killed because they are thought to be witches. If a child can be blamed for a tragedy or illness by claiming they are a witch they will be outcast, then beaten and then abandoned to rid the community of the witch.<span id="more-2750"></span></p>
<p>Lack of education combined with the abject poverty these folks live under contributes to the social environment that allows for witch hunts. Lack of education and poverty in our country contribute to most of our social ills as well. Fear of the unknown contributes to hate and hate crime. While I don&#8217;t think we can do that much to change the environment in Nigeria (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/22/do-not-send-your-money-to-nigeria/">Do Not Send Your Money To Nigerian Spammers!</a>) we can make changes in our communities to help every child get an education and have an opportunity to climb out of poverty.</p>
<p>The video talks about a great man who is not gripped in the beliefs of these people and does everything he can for the accused witches. He maintains an orphanage for the abandoned and tortured children and unfortunately his facility is bursting at the seams.</p>
<p>There is a Facebook Page where you can help these children: Click <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=9476440119" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I suggest watching the video below and reading the original article on CNN.</p>
<p>One side note: According to the CNN article the exorcism and excommunication occurring in Nigeria is being done in Churches. It is being done with Pastors. It is a religious ceremony and considered to be part of Christianity.</p>
<p>I am sure nearly all American Christians would vehemently disagree with the beliefs and tactics of the Nigerian Christians. I think it is worthwhile noting that religious folks in Third World Countries living in poverty with little or no education tend to act irrationaly, violently and are extreme in their beliefs. This applies equally to Christians, Jews and yes, Muslims too.</p>
<p>Just something worth thinking about&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/book-cover.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2522" title="book-cover" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/book-cover-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="300" /></a>This summer I am taking two classes at Law School that explore many of the issues and themes of racism. I am extremely fascinated by racism, and ethnic hatred. I am still sorting out my feelings on a lot of the issues and I am really happy that I am being exposes to the everything that we are discussing in class.</p>
<p>In Hate Speech Seminar we read a (poorly written, but very interesting) book about the White Supremacy Movement in California through the 80&#8242;s and 90&#8242;s. (It&#8217;s called Skinhead Confessions and you can buy it on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1599551330?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1599551330">Skinhead Confessions: From Hate To Hope</a>. Again, not very well written but very enlightening and an important book.)</p>
<p>The question we have been probing is: Where does racism come from? Why do people hate?<span id="more-2520"></span></p>
<p>Of course, I welcome your suggestions in the comments.</p>
<p>CNN did a series on the famous Doll Test. (I wrote about the Doll Test in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/09/simple-justice-the-story-of-brown-v-board-of-education-the-end-of-separate-but-equal-in-schools/">Simple Justice | The Story of Brown v. Board of Education: The End of Separate But Equal in Schools</a>.) Anderson Cooper and a team at CNN performed a similar test to try and learn about how early racism can begin and whether we are effectively teaching our children the important lessons of non-discrimination.</p>
<p>I have included some of the video at the bottom of this post. To read more about their study go to the links at the bottom of the video.</p>
<p>In summary, there is a conclusive and scientific (<a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/05/13/expanded_results_methods_cnn.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>) &#8220;White Bias&#8221; among white and black students aged 4-5 years old and less so, but still present in white and black students 9-10 years old. Cooper and his team think this is a result of racist parents and preaching diversity and tolerance but not practicing it at home. This explains why so many children have a white bias.</p>
<p>I have a different theory.</p>
<p>Children, especially young children automatically gravitate to things that look like the things they are accustomed to being around. Young children associate with other children who share their most obvious characteristics. Whether it is height, body size, shirt color, lunchbox or skin color. When young children make choices it is often an indicator of things with which they are comfortable. Of course a white child, with white parents and white siblings is going to prefer things that are white. In fact I am surprised the numbers were not even higher and more in favor of white bias.</p>
<p>The troubling thing is white bias among black children. But this too has a very reasonable explanation. If a black child is a minority and feels like they are different, they will want to join the majority. If the majority is white, then a black child will gravitate to white. It is not racist. It is a white bias. But white bias does not equal racist. A young child with white bias does not portend a future with the skinheads.</p>
<p>I am certain that some of children come from bigoted homes and learned gross stereotypes from their parents. But I am also fairly certain that most of the white children just selected the things that were most familiar to them. Conversely, black children who are a minority want to fit in with the majority and selected the answers that they thought would help them fit in.</p>
<p>CNN, your study is great. But I don&#8217;t buy it.</p>
<p>Further, the guilt they made some of the parents feel over their children&#8217;s selections is plain sensationalist, irresponsible journalism. To take a few isolated questions asked of a 5 year old and show them to parents and then insinuate that the child is racist and the parents must also be racist is cruel, probably incorrect and a ratings grab. (Yes, believe it or not CNN pulled this shtick. You can find it somewhere on their impossible to navigate website.)</p>
<p>Is racism a problem? Yes.</p>
<p>To label 5 innocent 5 year olds racist because of their white bias? Come on, we are better than that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/israel_flag1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2055" title="CB015977" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/israel_flag-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="168" /></a>Last year, there were a large number of public incidents that shed a negative light on Jews in general and particularly on Orthodox Jews. These events were not representitive of the average Jewish person, yet their notoriety put them front and center in the media.</p>
<p>It seems that the Earthquake in Haiti has marked a reversal of negative media coverage into more positive media coverage in response to more positive actions by Jewish people.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/14/jewish-relief-efforts-for-haiti-earthquake-victims/" target="_blank">I noted last week that although the Jewish connection with Haiti is slim, there has been no shortage of Jewish efforts to aid the beleaguered people of Haiti.</a></p>
<p>It did not end with financial support.<span id="more-2047"></span> CNN has been reporting that the Israeli relief efforts were the quickest to respond and efforts were in full swing before any other country was set up. Israel was the first country with a field hospital in Haiti,  Additionaly, the Israeli relief efforts have been reported as effective and efficient by CNN and others.</p>
<p>You can see video below of CNN&#8217;s coverage.</p>
<p>I am also proud to report that my uncle made the news with his personal work on behalf of Haiti.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/47393/2010/01/20/monsey-ny-orthodox-community-leaders-meet-with-haitian-neighbors" target="_blank">Vosizneias is reporting</a> that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CD4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRonald_Greenwald&amp;ei=YkBXS5-iC4_EsQOCuqjGBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNES7nAkD6cORVmLylE121IZ1SC1-w&amp;sig2=E4ITL5bQQh41BJxz7MDJnQ" target="_blank">Rabbi Ronald Greenwald</a> (Uncle Ronnie, to me) is spearheading a drive in many Monsey NY private Jewish schools (Yeshivas) to collect food and supplies to be delivered to Haiti. This comes on the heels of an unrelated visit to Haiti 6 weeks prior in which he was inspired to help the impoverished nation. Greenwald promised the members of the the Haitian community that he would meet with them and accompany them on a delegation to Washington if needed. That meeting was scheduled for January 19.</p>
<p>Uncle Ronnie is no stranger to projects of this nature. He has spent his entire adult life working on behalf of Jewish and non-Jewish causes. Those who know him or know of him are not surprised by this news. The only thing surprising is that some people think it is &#8220;news&#8221;. This is a typical anecdote in his accomplished life and we wish him more opportunities and more success for many years to come.</p>
