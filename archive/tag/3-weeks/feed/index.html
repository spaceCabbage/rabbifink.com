				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7319" alt="images" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images.jpeg" width="275" height="183" /></a>The USA Today reports that there are some orthodox Jews who will watch fireworks tonight with no sound. Seeing as this year the 4th of July is during the 3 Weeks between Shiva Asar B&#8217;Tamuz and Tisha B&#8217;Av there are some elements of mourning that are customary during this period. Many orthodox Jews refrain from listening to music as part of their mourning these 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Fireworks are often accompanied by music. Journalist Menachem Wecker was curious if the music accompaniment would cause some orthodox Jews to forgo the usual fireworks celebrations.</p>
<p>There are probably very few orthodox Jews who care about July 4th who also would be so stringent about the 3 weeks that they would not even listen to background music. Of those who are that stringent, very few would care to participate in July 4th festivities.<span id="more-7318"></span></p>
<p>Are there any orthodox Jews who will avoid places that have music in the background? What do they do if they get put on hold? Radio advertisement jingles? Cell phone ring tones? Singing toddler toys? That <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQT9K_nkeVQ" target="_blank">awesome music that plays when you start Windows 2000</a>? Obviously these questions are absurd. The real prohibition is against live music and celebration. Most orthodox Jews extend that to recored music as well. But I don&#8217;t think there are many people who avoid music at all costs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I told Menachem Wecker when he talked with me about this issue and then I was quoted in his article.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the headline though. It kind of says the opposite of what the article says.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, if a July 4th celebration would interfere with one&#8217;s observance of the appropriate level of mourning at this time of year, I think one should make their own decision to refrain from celebrating. I don&#8217;t that would apply to many people, but out first allegiance is to Torah, then and only then do we pledge allegiance to the flag.</p>
<p>Enjoy the holiday. Happy birthday America!</p>
