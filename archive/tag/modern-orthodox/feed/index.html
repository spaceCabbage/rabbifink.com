		<description><![CDATA[“The LORD will establish you for a holy people to Himself, as He has sworn to you; if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in His ways. And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the LORD is called upon you; and they shall be [...]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>“The LORD will establish you for a holy people to Himself, as He has sworn to you; if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in His ways. And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the LORD is called upon you; and they shall be afraid of you.” &#8211; Deuteronomy 28:9-10 </i></p>
<p>Before Moses delivers a litany of curses upon the Israelites he offers some words of hope and blesses the people. In summary, Moses tells the people that if they follow the word of G-D all kinds of good things will happen for them. <i>“You will blessed in the city and you will be blessed in the field.”</i> And so on.<span id="more-7558"></span></p>
<p>The incentive to be good is strong. One of the more powerful verses of blessing describes how we will be perceived by the nations of the world if we are obedient to G-D’s word. The verse tells us that people of the earth will “see G-D’s name upon us” and they will be afraid of us.</p>
<p>What is this fear? Why will the nations fear us? What is this name of G-D that arouses this fear?<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Ki-Savo-2013-Web-Dvar-Torah.pdf"><br />
</a><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7560" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/monumental-tefillin-600x448.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Talmud (Brachos 6a) says that R’ Eliezer teaches us that this “name of G-D” is the <i>Tefillin</i> that is worn upon the head. One has to wonder what R’ Eliezer means with this statement. Does he meant that if we wear our <i>tefillin </i>we will be protected from persecution and ridicule? Are the <i>tefillin</i> a magical talisman? Is it that simple? Is that even possible?</p>
<p>There are photos of great Jewish martyrs during the Holocaust wearing their <i>Tefillin</i>. It seems that the Nazis did not fear our <i>tefillin</i>. What happened? Was it just a matter of us not being worthy of the blessing? Exactly what is R’ Eliezer saying?</p>
<p>Rabbi Lamm explains R’ Eliezer’s statement by observing the context of the Talmudic passage. Immediately after R’ Eliezer says that the “name of G-D” upon us is the <i>tefillin </i>that is worn upon the head, the Talmud wonders about G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i></p>
<p>The Talmud asks: And what is written in G-D’s <i>tefillin</i>? In G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>we would find a verse lauding the Jewish people. “Who is like the Jewish people, one nation upon the earth?” Meaning, our <i>tefillin</i> speak to G-D’s unity as expressed in the four chapters we place inside, accordingly G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>speak to our unity. It’s a symbiotic relationship. We express G-D’s unity and G-D expresses ours.</p>
<p>In a novel twist, Rabbi Lamm proclaims that R’ Eliezer was not actually referring to our <i>tefillin </i>at all! Rather he was referring to G-D’s <i>tefillin!</i> That is the context of the <i>sugya. </i>In other words, when we live the maxim of G-D’s <i>tefillin</i> then the people of the earth will fear us. What is that maxim? That we have unity and that we are a singular nation.</p>
<p>When we are comfortable and confident in our singularity we succeed. R’ Eliezer is teaching us to be strong in our ability to stand on our own. If we can stand strong on our own, we inspire awe from the people of the earth. When we are not vying for approval or desperately trying to assimilate, we are demonstrating to the world the message of G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i> However, if do try to leave our Jewishness at home, or worse in the trash heap of history, the people of the earth will not find anything awesome about the Jewish people.</p>
<p>The idea is that when people are confident in their convictions and believe what they are doing is right, they earn the respect of others. Of course, this only applies when one is also respectful and kind to the others. Acting zealously because we think we are right and everyone else is wrong will undoubtably result in treatment in kind. If we are hateful toward others or act in a manner that breeds hate, we can expect to be treated at least as badly by those others. But there is a way to act in confidence with respect for others. This is exactly what R’ Eliezer was trying to say. When we are doing the right thing, with the confidence of G-D’s <i>tefillin</i> we earn the awe and reverence of others.</p>
<p>This is all on a national level. When the Jewish people as a whole act the way they are supposed to act, and we do so with confidence and pride, we gain the respect of others.</p>
<p>As much as it applies to us as a people, it applies to us as individuals as well. We can see this from the the man who taught us this lesson in the Talmud. It’s not just our confidence as a nation but also confidence as individual people.</p>
<p>R’ Eliezer lived this maxim. He found himself on the opposing side of the rabbis of his generation time and time again. His opinions are disproportionately unpopular. R’ Eliezer is most well known for the incident regarding the <i>tanur shel achnai</i> where his opinion differed from the other sages. But he stood by his convictions even inviting nature itself to testify on his behalf. It did not matter than his colleagues had the numbers. R’ Eliezer believed he was right. Ultimately, none of that mattered as we follow the majority in rabbinic disputes of halacha. Indeed, R’ Eliezer paid a price as he lived out his days in isolation as punishment for not acceding to the rabbis. But R’ Eliezer stood tall and true to his convictions. R’ Eliezer’s strength and confidence shines through this and other episodes in the Talmud. He lived the ideas G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i></p>
<p>As a people we struggle with this. On the one hand we have adapted and adopt from our surroundings over the course of our collective history. There is tension between this chameleon-like attitude toward our environment and our ancient traditions that sometimes put us at odds with our neighbors and their ideas. It requires us to dance around the raindrops sometimes. But we must remember that we believe we have the truth. We must be careful to be respectful and friendly to all who are not members of our group while we stand by our convictions with confidence.</p>
<p>Within Judaism we have subgroups as well. Each is entitled to believe it is doing Judaism the right way. However our confidence in our subgroup cannot allow us lose respect and courtesy to our co-religionists from other subgroups. If we pervert our confidence in our way of life with hate and demonization of others our confidence is mere braggadocio.</p>
<p>We certainly should feel that our way of life is the right way to live. Some subgroups excel at this while other languish in self-loathing. I think the least confident subgroup in Judaism is Modern Orthodoxy. This is not a criticism of the Modern Orthodox theology, rather it is a reflection of a sad reality that too many Modern Orthodox Jews feel second class.</p>
<p>All subgroups should feel confident that they are doing G-D’s will. All subgroups should be respectful of the other subgroups. Modern Orthodoxy should be proud of their way of life. There is no need to constantly defer to other subgroups. Modern Orthodoxy can be vibrant and viable in our world.</p>
<p>When Modern Orthodoxy can live confidently it will flourish. It will find G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>are easily discerned among Modern Orthodox Jews. With the deftness that only Modern Orthodoxy can possess, its people will inspire awe and wonder among the people of the earth, not least of which, the rest of the Jewish people. - <em>Good Shabbos</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this week&#8217;s Yated, Rabbi Birnbaum writes a pretty offensive article aimed at the modern orthodox community. In private and public correspondence the article is being heavily criticized for its many flaws.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wish to discuss its salient points, errors, or fallacies here or anywhere else for that matter. I am not interested in debating or fighting with Yated people about the two different communities. It&#8217;s pointless and I am sick of it.</p>
<p>Instead I want to propose a solution.<span id="more-7434"></span></p>
<p>Much of the heated exchange between the yeshivish and modern orthodox communities is based on a lot of misinformation and hearsay. There is very little communication between the two groups. Rarely do the two groups work together to solve social or political issues. There are no formal forums where both communities interact in writing. Facebook is the closest thing we have to a common area for discussion and I have been blessed to host many conversations on my Facebook page where people from across the spectrum interact. But it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>In the old days we lived among one another. We shared resources. We worked together on common issues. There was a rapport. Today our respective communities are so vibrant and are thriving. We don&#8217;t need each other. We stand apart, separated by the tiniest of margins. It&#8217;s a blessing that we have become so strong as individual groups but in my mind it has caused this divide.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7435" alt="Reaching out" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/handshake.jpg" /></p>
<p>True, we disagree on a lot. We disagree about the value and power of Daas Torah. We disagree about Chazal and science. We disagree on the value of full time learning and how long it is appropriate. We disagree on the importance of fathers providing for their family. We disagree on the level of insularity. We disagree on the harms of media consumption. We disagree on Zionism. We disagree on the flexibility of some areas of halacha. We disagree on the emphasis on chumros. Yes, we disagree. But in the end, this is a minuscule fraction of what we agree upon. We agree on Torah M&#8217;Sinai. We agree on Rambam. We agree on Shulchan Aruch. We agree on R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein. We basically agree on Israel. We agree on America. We basically agree on education for children. We agree on so much.</p>
<p>Yet, as we have noted many times, when we are similar to one another we seek ways to distinguish ourselves from one another. That&#8217;s what has happened here. We&#8217;ve divided ourselves over petty matters and it&#8217;s starting to affect our midos toward each other.</p>
<p>The solution here is quite simple. People from all walks of life need to get together and talk. We need to have Shabbatons for all kinds of people to enjoy the company of one another. We need to tackle issues of common concern together. We need a formal place to talk to each other instead of about each other. I doubt Rabbi Birnbaum would have dropped his article as a comment on Ha&#8217;emtza or even on my Facebook page (although I have gotten worse). But he&#8217;s writing for Yated readers and somehow (read: the Internet) the modern orthodox community gets ahold of the article, reads it, and to them he sounds off the wall. It would be so much more productive to talk to each other rather than writing screeds on blogs or &#8220;olde tyme&#8221; blogs (newspapers) like the Yated.</p>
<p>The modern orthodox community must be able to articulate its positions from a place of strength and confidence. The yeshivish community must be able to express its positions with less bombast. Both communities must try to hear the other side. But most of all, this conversation should not be between strangers, it should be between friends.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got to figure out a way to have friends from across the spectrum of orthodox Judaism. The issues have to be personalized by the humanity of relationships.</p>
<p>If this doesn&#8217;t work and we still can&#8217;t find a way to communicate civilly and productively, I&#8217;ll try to think of something else. But in the meantime, l&#8217;maan Hashem, let&#8217;s try to do this right.</p>
<p>This is a formal invitation to engage in a round table or panel discussion on the issues that are plaguing our communities. Let&#8217;s talk to each other, not about each other.</p>
<p>I am happy to host or attend such a conversation. If you are interested, please contact me. Send this to people from both sides of this issue and let&#8217;s make it happen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2603_MEDIUM.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7226" alt="2603_MEDIUM" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2603_MEDIUM-300x272.jpg" width="300" height="272" /></a>Yesterday, in an article in Newsday, the world was introduced to the term Tuna Beigel. Now it&#8217;s time to retire it.</p>
<p>A little Googling will yield plenty of results for the term and almost all of them are negative. It&#8217;s used to describe people born to chasidic families who modernize. They keep many of the exterior elements of chasidishe life but lead lives that are not insular at all. They are familiar with popular culture, they have less rigid ideas about modesty, and they live outside the chasidic enclaves. However, I would say that these people are by and large orthodox. If they leave orthodoxy they leave this group.</p>
<p>For non-chasidim, these people can seem odd. They don&#8217;t speak English well, they are under-educated, they have chasidishe foibles and tendencies. Because of these barriers they don&#8217;t really integrate perfectly into the mainstream yeshiva world or into the modern orthodox world. Hence, they have their own group and their own name. The separate name and their lack of integration are an indictment of the frum world. Non-chasidim must do a better job of welcoming those who left insular community. Titles that mock their difficult choice would not a good way of doing this.</p>
<p>The problem is that Tuna Beigel is a pejorative.<span id="more-7225"></span> It is used to mock their Yinglish and I am told that many people use it derisively and many feel derided by the word. Of course there are many people from this group that use the word proudly. They are not insulted by the word at all. But too many people find the term offensive for it to be used in civilized conversation.</p>
<p>Personally, I compare it to using the &#8220;off the derech&#8221; to describe someone who left orthodox Judaism. I try very hard not to use that description because I think it is offensive. It tells those who left orthodox Judaism that they are off the path which implies that they are defective. While it&#8217;s true that orthodox Jews believe there is a path and those who left are not on the path, calling attention to that is implicitly offensive. Now, some people who fit into that category don&#8217;t find it offensive. That&#8217;s cool. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that we should use it. You&#8217;ll not find a single mention of that phrase on this blog unless I am quoting or paraphrasing someone else. That&#8217;s because I find it offensive.</p>
<p>Similarly, the term for modernized chasidim should not be offensive. In fact, I believe they should be celebrated and embraced. They are heroes. They are choosing our life. And it&#8217;s even more impressive that they are staying within the confines of orthodox Judaism even after having left the insular community. That&#8217;s the interesting thing about the article in Newsday. It&#8217;s a growing phenomenon and we hope it continues to grow.</p>
<p>In my private life I don&#8217;t use the word Tuna Beigel. In my public life I do not want to use it either and I don&#8217;t want others to use it. Try Modern Chasidim if you need a title. That&#8217;s what I use and I think it is a respectful and accurate description. (Modern Orthodox doesn&#8217;t work because that group stands for Torah U&#8217;Mada, excellence in secular education and high professional accomplishment. Hopefully the next generation of Modern Chasidim can grow into that.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s stop using this ugly term to describe Modern Chasidim. Let&#8217;s do a better job of helping them integrate into the non-chasidic world. If I offended anyone by my association with the article in Newsday, please forgive me. I admire the Modern Chasidim (and you ex-hasids too) and did not intend to hurt anyone. I hope we can work together to end the use of this term and create a brighter future for those who choose not to stay in the insular chasidic community.</p>
<p>(Also, I think the article is interesting. I was quoted a few times too.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Julius-Berman.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6290" title="Julius-Berman" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Julius-Berman-217x300.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="300" /></a>Ami Magazine, which has been the subject of a couple pretty harsh blog posts on this blog, has a lovely interview with Julius Berman. I confess to not knowing the name Julius Berman before I read the interview and I am certain that most non-YU people that are around my age have not heard of him either.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame, because Julius Berman should be celebrated as a hero of American orthodox Judaism in the yeshiva world as well. He is a great example of what a good Torah Jew should strive to be. I know that I do.</p>
<p>I am very glad that Ami wrote the article and I am very glad I had a chance to read it. Everyone should read the full article.</p>
<p>There are a few things that I took away from the article that were beneath the surface of its substance.<span id="more-6289"></span></p>
<p>1) There are not a lot of people like Julius Berman. But the likelihood of another Julius Berman is becoming more remote. He is a man who has traversed the worlds of YU, the yeshiva world, and had genuine interaction with chasidic leaders. Those three worlds are become so much more independent and autonomous as time goes on. It will be difficult for younger people to follow Berman&#8217;s example.</p>
<p>2) I love how he didn&#8217;t want to write a <em>kvitel</em>. Over the last 25 years <em>chasidus</em> has mainstreamed to the point that most people would not think twice about writing a <em>kvitel.</em> Berman believed in his non-<em>chasidic </em>convictions enough to try to refuse a <em>kvitel.</em><em> </em>That impressed me.</p>
<p>3) My one critique is how the interview tried to blame the division between modern Orthodoxy and more right wing orthodoxy on the term Modern Orthodox and then blame the terminology on the modern Orthodox community. Let&#8217;s be real here, for better or for worse, the modern Orthodox community reveres, and relies on the right wing orthodox community. Not the other way around. It&#8217;s hard to pin the divisiveness on any one side, but certainly it is more of a stretch to pin it on the modern Orthodox community.</p>
<p>Overall the article was good. Kudos to Ami for taking the modern Orthodox plunge. It does not exonerate them for their prior sins (the ones we discussed on this blog are far from the only problems I am aware of&#8230;), but I am happy to see that they are trying to increase visibility for an important part of <em>Klal Yisrael. </em>I hope that this will help bridge the gaps that we have created for ourselves. At the very least, the right wing orthodox community will see a nice article that is a classic case of modern Orthodoxy presented in a positive light. Thank you for that.</p>
<p>Read the article. It&#8217;s good. Click the link for a link to a PDF of the article.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RichardJoelHeadshot.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6253" title="RichardJoelHeadshot" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RichardJoelHeadshot-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>Contrary to popular belief, I did not attend Yeshiva University. I&#8217;ve only been there four times in my life. Once for a concert, twice for a video job, and once for the Seforim Sale in 2001 (I bought a Tzidkas HaTzadik and a fancy Mesillas Yesharim). But as I have evolved through my adult years, I have come to learn that I share a considerable amount with YU in many respects.</p>
<p>This is not entirely surprising as the Yeshivas that I attended are not that far off from YU in terms of their overall worldview. With the recent shifts to the right across orthodox Judaism, YU is now very near the style of Judaism in which I was raised.</p>
<p>I was offered the opportunity to interview President Joel as a follow up to his State of the University address which was masterfully delivered at YU last night. President Joel is even better on the phone than he is behind the podium and I really enjoyed our conversation. We discussed a variety of topics that are of interest to the readers of this blog and while I didn&#8217;t transcribe every word of our conversation, I did take notes. What follows is a synopsis of the more compelling parts of our conversation.</p>
<p>What jumped out at me during the State of the University Address was President Joel&#8217;s use of the term Modern Orthodox L&#8217;Chatchila.<span id="more-6251"></span> I too have discussed this topic and am a firm believer that the most perfect Jew is one who is passionate about Torah and scholarship in Torah while being engaged in the outside world. In our conversation, President Joel expanded on this by explaining that Torah U&#8217;Mada can be a very sterile approach. The new approach is Shleimus, the complete person. The idea is that Torah is not supposed to be practiced in an Ir Miklat (city of refuge), it is supposed to be a launching pad. While Torah U&#8217;Mada is part of that philosophy, it became associated with certain apologetics. The modified approach is that Torah U&#8217;Mada is an aspiration, not one specific approach for those who can&#8217;t hack more insular versions of orthodoxy.</p>
<p>This relates to the idea of the Big Tent that President Joel spoke of. There has to be a place for as many people as possible to fit under the tent. In his words, Jews are better at division than multiplication. It&#8217;s a cute line, but also rings true. Although, in my opinion <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/21/there-is-no-tent/">There is No Tent</a>.</p>
<p>We also discussed the basic dichotomy of insularity vs. engagement. President Joel echoed my thoughts when he described the history of Ashkenazi Jewry. We didn&#8217;t have the option of engagement for most of those years. Our ideal was simply to survive. Survival meant physical and spiritual survival. But President Joel said that the Torah wants us to thrive, not merely survive. Thriving means to engage. There are risks to engagement. The tightrope is difficult to walk. But the view from that tightrope is supremely grand. He compared it to the seven branched menorah with the six lights on the sides pointing toward the middle.</p>
<p>President Joel acknowledged that there are people who leave modern Orthodoxy just like there are people who leave more insular groups. It&#8217;s not a solution as much as an alternative. But the main factors according to President Joel are not philosophy or worldview. The main factors are the home, education, and as he puts it &#8211; mazel. In many respects, society is antithetical to Torah and its values. We need passion and intellectual Judaism to survive that threat.</p>
<p>I told President Joel that even where I come from, the leftmost edge of the yeshiva world, YU is usually a topic of derision. I asked President Joel if he had a message for those on the right that look askance at YU. He began his response by making it very clear that they have respect for the entire Jewish community. To the right and to the left. He invited anyone to come to the Beis Medrash and see that it is comparable to any great yeshiva throughout the world. He said you&#8217;ll find 600 guys learning lishma at night seder. The Roshei Yeshiva are all very significant Torah scholars. They also have degrees. 60% have Masters and 20% have a Ph.D. He volunteered that they don&#8217;t treat Gemara like a college course. Torah is Torah and it is primary. He offered anyone who wants to see it in person to come and wear a mask if they want. But they will see that despite some hashkafic differences, YU is mehadrin when it comes to commitment to Torah learning.</p>
<p>My follow up question was whether YU was doing or considering doing &#8220;kiruv&#8221; on the charedim to try and engage charedim and bring more charedim to YU. He responded that the economic realities are making YU a more attractive option. People need to earn a living now more than ever before and YU gives young people a chance to continue their learning and lay the foundation for a parnassah. Additionally, YUTorah.org gets 75,000 hits a month. Whenever he meets charedim people tell him they love YUTorah.org. Through Torah there is more of a connection than ever before. <a href="http://efink.tumblr.com/post/30917612411/maimonides-is-a-bit-like-a-trojan-horse-of-reason" target="_blank">To borrow a term</a>, YUTorah.org is like the YU Trojan Horse into the charedi world. President Joel is in contact with charedi leaders but he gets the sense that there is not much interest on their part. But he noted that there are fewer attacks against YU these days. I think that might have to do with the new charedi whipping boy YCT. But President Joel ended this part of our conversation by reiterating that he really believes Eilu v&#8217;Eilu applies here. He would love for recruitment to go to more charedi high schools and they have started to do that a little bit. The big tent includes the right and the left.</p>
<p>Our last two topics were more specific. I asked President Joel about Orthopraxy and those leaving Chasidic Judaism. First Orthopraxy. President Joel was very familiar with the phenomenon but began by saying that Orthopraxy is better than nothing. Mitoch shelo lishma, bah lishmah. He believes that the Education School is dealing with this on a broad scale. Passionless Judaism is a huge challenge. But he felt that there is plenty of passion at YU. President Joel led the first night of slichos with 1000 people in attendance. When he began with Ashrei Yoshvei Veisecha, the roar of the people joining him in prayer was very inspiring. There is a richness of passion at YU and he believes that this is helpful in avoiding Orthopraxy. But in the end, Judaism is more about deed than creed and the primary concern is with mitzvah not emunah. Certainly Judaism cannot be transmitted without spirituality and God, it must be linked with the Divine to thrive, but our focus is on action, not belief. But there is very little that is specifically targeting Orthopraxy and Atheism at YU and President Joel said the point was well taken and perhaps should be addressed more directly.</p>
<p>Finally we got to the ex-Chasids. I told him about my friends in real life and online that left chasidic Judaism. For a lot them, the Chasidic world was a very fragile bubble and once that bubble burst, the only place to go was out. Out meant, out of orthodox Judaism entirely. Personally, I think that many ex-Chasids would be very happy and very successful modern Orthodox Jews. But there is no track from Chasidic insularity to YU. I asked if YU could somehow market itself as an attractive alternative to insular life in the Chasidic world and perhaps provide a soft landing for ex-Chasids. He agreed that this was a great idea, but said that there is nothing like that happening right now. He did say that when Dr. Pelcovitz speaks to charedim and chasidic Jews he always says that he is a professor at YU. The idea is to present YU to them in a way that they may acknowledge its existence positively. This is a tiny step, but an important one. Professor Joel invited me to email him about this idea and discuss it further. I look forward to that opportunity and hope to make good on my suggestion in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/22/can-judaism-survive-the-internet/">Can Judaism Survive the Internet?</a>.</p>
<p>I had a wonderful time talking with President Joel and I hope to continue our conversation in the future. Thank you President Joel for your time and the opportunity to get to know YU on a personal level.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1828636222-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5735" title="1828636222-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1828636222-1-300x173.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="173" /></a>One blogger at the New York Celebrate Israel Parade was so overwhelmed by the orthodox community&#8217;s involvement at the parade that she declared the future of Judaism in America to be orthodoxy. To be clear, the writer is not orthodox, but the lack of apparent vibrancy from the non-orthodox seemed to swing her vote for orthodoxy as the future of Judaism in America.</p>
<p>I happen to agree. It is extremely difficult to maintain cultural and social Judaism absent ritual and observance of Jewish law. It can be done, but it is becoming more difficult with each passing generation. The proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p>The brand of orthodoxy that will prevail in America is still up for discussion. The writer of that blog post was referring to modern orthodox Judaism seeing as they are the ones she saw at the parade.</p>
<p>Another person at the parade was overwhelmed to a certain degree by the participation of the non-orthodox. This person felt that orthodoxy was not as well represented as they could and should have been. In this person&#8217;s opinion, the parade showcased non-orthodox Jews showing their passion for Israel. The orthodox Jews were like an afterthought. This person is an orthodox Jew.<span id="more-5734"></span></p>
<p>How interesting is it that two different perspectives can yield such different observations?</p>
<p>I believe that we need a combination of the two to maximize the chances of success for American Judaism. And the perfect opportunity to implement this vision is at the parade. Israel is something we all (with the exception of some fringe anti-Israel groups) can agree upon. Israel activism and AIPAC are full of orthodox Jews. Not just modern orthodox Jews. More right wing Jews strongly identify with Israel as well. The JewsNews sites report heavily on Israeli society, politics, and events. Those are sites that are read and written by right leaning (not in the political sense) orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>It seems to me that a parade for Israel is the perfect time to march together in support of a cause and in solidarity with each other. The modern orthodox community has embraced this opportunity and marches in the parade every year. But aside from a few sporadic people from the more yeshivish side of the spectrum, the Agudah / chasidic / Lakewood communities are noticeably absent from the parade.</p>
<p>I understand that there are political concerns. I understand there may be halachic concerns as well. But I just wish we could see past those, if only for one day to stand together and do something as a united Jewish people. I just wish that for once, we could all join in unison and make a clear statement on behalf of something we all agree upon.</p>
<p>In the future of American Judaism, all Jews are able to work together on the things upon which we agree, and there are many such things. The places where we disagree will still be contested. But it will be more like two opinions from the same team as opposed to two opinions from opposing teams.</p>
<p>If we are to get there, I think the New York Celebrate Israel Parade <strong>2013</strong> is a great place to start.</p>

<p>Lately it seems like everyone is trying to define Modern Orthodoxy. The purpose of these attempts revolves around one specific institution and its graduates, Yeshiva Chovevei Torah (YCT).</p>
<p>Four articles (<a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/09/27/modern-orthodoxy-at-a-crossroads-2/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/11/09/modern-orthodoxy-is-always-at-the-crossroads/" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/11/13/modern-orthodoxy-in-the-crosshairs/" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/11/16/defining-modern-orthodoxy’s-crossroads/" target="_blank">4</a>) on a prominent Centrist-Orthodox blog tried to tackle the YCT issue (see links below). Three of the articles called on Modern Orthodoxy to disaffiliate with YCT. One article explained that YCT deserved to be included in the Modern Orthodox tent. Much ink has been spilled over YCT and the more that is written, the more things stay the same. Platitudes and proclamations have done nothing to stop YCT. Indeed, they serve a need within Orthodox Jewish community. They tend to those who would like to be Orthodox but find some its social constraints too limiting. There is a place for YCT. However, there is no place for the articles calling for its demise.</p>
<p>The articles assume there is an umbrella under which some institutions, rabbis or individuals are permitted to take shelter. The outsiders are subject to excommunication and ridicule. It is a tent where like-minded people share common goals, appreciation and self-congratulation. In their opinion, YCT belongs outside the tent.</p>
<p>A second assumption in the articles is that Modern Orthodox Judaism needs a definition. It must be codified lest it suffer some horrible end. Without a definition it is doomed to be over-inclusive and possibly even under-inclusive. There is talk that YCT is “counterfeiting Torah” and that must be ousted from the Modern Orthodox camp.</p>
<p>All this talk of camps, umbrellas, tents and definitions is misplaced. Similarly, limited denominations such as Orthodox, Conservative and Reform are misplaced.<span id="more-4860"></span></p>
<p>Tackling the second assumption first, it seems that Modern Orthodoxy has a complex. It needs “defining.” It is as if Modern Orthodoxy feels that it is novel form of serving God or an aberration from the classic style of Jewish life. Nothing could be further from the truth. Modern Orthodoxy needs to have the confidence to positively assert that Modern Orthodoxy is not the “kid brother” of big-boy Charedi Judaism. It is the Charedi world that is an aberration from almost every Jewish society in recorded history.</p>
<p>Jewish life for over 2500 years has been determined by fealty to God, Torah and Mitzvos all while living with one foot in the general society. Tannaim held typical jobs and conducted conversations with Greek philosophers. Similarly, Amoraim discussed religion with Roman royalty. During the period of the Geonim and Rishonim, Jews had jobs, educated Jews studied the sciences and philosophy of their day and the great Torah scholars were well versed in many disciplines including Torah. Even during the period of the Achronim, many of the most famous interpreters and codifiers of law were proficient in science, mathematics and philosophy.</p>
<p>Where is the societal precedent for today’s isolationism and shunning of all wisdom outside of Torah? Why does Modern Orthodoxy not proudly assume the mantle of traditional Judaism? Why does it always feel like Modern Orthodoxy needs to be explaining and defining itself?</p>
<p>Modern Orthodox Judaism is a straight shot from the Jewish life that was lived for thousands of years by Torah observant Jews. There is nothing for Modern Orthodox Jews to be ashamed of other than not realizing this important point. Torah observance is primary; there is no doubt about that. Wisdom found outside Torah has always been valued and there is no reason that should be any different today.</p>
<p>As to the first assumption, that of the tent: Judaism is the only necessary denomination. Everything else is just the narcissism of small differences.</p>
<p>Throughout Jewish history, Jews with varying degrees of observance and a variety of beliefs lived side by side. Sometimes they quarreled, oftentimes vociferously, but their disagreements took place in one tent. It was unwise and unfruitful to divide and self define into small groups. More significantly, there was no social benefit to doing so.</p>
<p>In Ashkenaz, for their non-Jewish neighbors, the Jewish people were “the other.” For the Jewish people, the non-Jewish people were “the other.” There was no need to drill down into subgroups. There was no social benefit to subgrouping.</p>
<p>When non-Jews ceased to be “the other,” as Ashkenazik Jews became more integrated into general society, a new “other” was created. The more integrated group branded the more isolated group as “Orthodox” and the more isolated group branded the more integrated group “Reform.” Jews were now “the other” for other Jews.</p>
<p>In truth, this was a tragedy. Judaism is not just a religion. It is a family. We are all united as Jews by common ancestry. We are also united as people who follow the Jewish religion. But one can be a non-religious Jew. This is not so with other religions. By calling one another “the other” we cast aspersion across the religious spectrum. Fights and disagreements ensue. Communication is halted. And this is where we start erecting self-serving tents. There should be only one tent. A tent that is large enough for our entire family, no matter how they observe. Our family should all be able to live under one tent.</p>
<p>This is not a pipe dream. At least three contemporary Jewish communities function in this way. These communities are the South African, Persian/Iranian and the Syrian communities. In these communities there is no segmentation based on Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox. Rather, everyone is part of a larger community and within the larger community some families are more observant than others. Yet, many different levels of observance will be found in one shul or one school</p>
<p>It wasn’t too long ago that this was the case in Ashkenazic communities in North America. In the 60’s and 70’s, children from non-observant homes went to school with children from very observant homes. The greater Jewish community was not strong enough to tolerate subgroups and segmentation. Our strength has become a curse. We are now very strong and we now are willing to exclude fellow Jews from our tent.</p>
<p>These subgroups do not serve a religious purpose. Judaism has always been about performing the mitzvot as prescribed in the Torah. It is a personal relationship between Man and Creator. There is no allegiance that must be paid to human dogmas. People are supposed to study, learn and forge their own relationship with God.</p>
<p>To this end, what purpose does the tent serve? Who needs a tent and tenets of the tent to tell them what to do and how to act? The Torah, its interpreters and codifiers have given us all that we need. The tent only serves one purpose: to exclude others.</p>
<p>It is true. Most Jews are not Orthodox. Most Jews do not celebrate Shabbat and the holidays the way that Orthodox Jews celebrate those days. Most Jews do not adhere to the strict rigors of halacha. So what? Why should those factors determine who is the tent? Who benefits by not allowing them into our tent? No one does.</p>
<p>The differences in observance might matter at some point. A Shabbat invitation will require that both parties are comfortable with the level of kashrut. A dating couple will need to be religiously compatible. There are a few examples, but they are only a few. It is up to the individual parties to try to find common ground. A tent is not needed to make these decisions for us.</p>
<p>Are we scared that some exposure to less halachically observant Jews will cause or own to run off and frolic in the fields with the less observant? Is the current edition of Orthodox Judaism so flimsy that mere interaction with others will cause it to crumble beneath the weight of enlightenment? I should hope not. If we have the truth, and I believe we do, what are we so afraid of?</p>
<p>As the rabbi of a shul that calls itself Orthodox but is a spiritual home to Jews (and non-Jews) of every single level of observance, I can attest that it can be done. Not only can it be done, it can be done in spectacular fashion. Our shul has something akin to a “Don’t ask, don’t tell” policy. Anyone who wishes to pray and learn in our shul is welcome. There is no “Tzitzis check.” There is no subgrouping based on observance. And it works. Sometimes there are awkward moments. But our relationships are more important than those moments of discomfort and I don’t believe any of us would trade our friendships and shul family so that we would never have to think critically on our own about how we interact with others. I believe we have a viable model. I believe that we have a preferable model. I believe our tent is big enough for every Jewish person to find spiritual shelter together. I believe that firmly grabbing hold of the Modern Orthodox, non-isolationist view, we can return to a more authentic and traditional Judaism that empowers us to embrace Jew of all textures and flavors. It will allow us to break free from the limitations of a tent and it confining walls. Following this model, there is no tent.</p>

I never read that section. But the headline grabbed me because it was not really about fashion or style. It was about religion and Mormons in particular.</p>
<p>The article talked about modern Mormons trying to fit in with their non-Mormon social circles.</p>
<p>I have a &#8220;thing&#8221; with Mormons.</p>
<p>Of all the religions in the world, I think the closest religion to Orthodox Judaism in many respects is Mormonism. I don&#8217;t mean in a theoligical sense. I mean in a practical, real world sense.</p>
<p>The kinds of challenges and successes that Mormons have resemble that of orthodox Jews. Both are minority religions in a predominantly &#8220;Traditional Christian&#8221; country. Both give their adherents opportunities to thrive in the modern world. But both also have a bit of a tradition of reluctance to modernity. So it is striking that both have embraced modernity in their own ways.<span id="more-4832"></span></p>
<p>Brigham Young University is a Mormon college. It strikes me as being very similar to Yeshiva University or even my alma mater, Ner Israel. I wrote about that sometime a while back: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/02/the-byu-honor-code-and-me/">The BYU Honor Code and Me</a></p>
<p>To me the article in the NY Times sounded a lot like Modern Orthodox Judaism. Young people who aspire to achieve success in the secular world who are also extremely restricted by their religion within that secular world. The restrictions are different between but they are similar as well.</p>
<p>For example: Clothing. Mormons are required to wear modest clothing on the outside but also a religious article of clothing on the inside. Orthodox Jews have the same. Different in the details but similar in spirit.</p>
<p>Another example: Social Drinking. Alcohol plays a huge social role. Parties serve alcohol, bars are frequent places of meeting and Mormons are forbidden from drinking alcohol altogether. Orthodox Jews are allowed to drink. But there are many restrictions that prevent (perhaps by design) absolute fraternization with non-Jews. Wine must be kosher. Mixed drinks must contain only kosher ingredients. Social drinking can be cumbersome.</p>
<p>I think these sort of parallels reflect a greater parallel between the two religions. This all leads me to one important thing to consider.</p>
<p>We live in a country that is predominately Christian. By and large, Christians have been wonderful friends to the Jews and particularly to Israel. But there is always the sneaking suspicion that we are still &#8220;the other&#8221;. I know I sense it. Similarly, Mormons have also been subjected to feeling like &#8220;the other&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am not criticizing anyone for making Jews or Mormons feel like &#8220;the other&#8221;. I am just saying that it exists and sometimes it rears its ugly head.</p>
<p>Rick Perry&#8217;s campaign has managed to make both Jews and Mormons feel significantly like &#8220;the other&#8221;. First Jews at his Prayer Rally and then Mormons when a member of his staff said some not-nice things about Mormons.</p>
<p>So Mormons, we know how you feel, in more ways than one&#8230;</p>
