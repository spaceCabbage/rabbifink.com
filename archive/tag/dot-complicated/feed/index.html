				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Randi Zuckerberg, sister of Mark Zuckerberg, inventor of the Internet, or something like that, published an article in the Daily Mail about Internet use. It’s a promo for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062285149/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062285149&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank">recently published book called Dot Complicated</a>. Her premise in the article is that being too digitally attached is causing us to forget to live our lives.</p>
<p>She talks a bit about the idea of a Digital Sabbath that is gaining in popularity. Taking one day off from our gadgets and simply spending quality time with our loved ones.</p>
<p><span id="more-7847"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/unplug.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7848" alt="unplug" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/unplug.jpg" /></a>Further, she urges us to be aware of the difference between communicating via the Internet and communicated face to face or even through a phone call. It’s much more personal to directly tell close one about news or happenings in one’s life. Just because the Internet makes it easier, does not mean it should substitute for more traditional means of communication in all instances.</p>
<p>I have two things to say about this article.</p>
<p>First, while a Digital Sabbath is a superb idea and I love that it’s finding mainstream acceptance, I am loathe to use this as a reason to observe Shabbos. To me, Shabbos is an eternal day. It hearkens back to the earliest recorded moments of our religious history. It is the basis for Torah observance. It is not to be relegated to some digital vacation. It&#8217;s much more than that. And it&#8217;s been observed for millennia. Facebook is 9 years old.</p>
<p>I love the idea that other people are finding value in unplugging. I find it valuable too. But I really don’t like the idea that this is the primary idea of what Shabbos has become about. No. Shabbos is not a day to unplug. It’s a day to <em>plug in</em>. We <em>plug in</em> to our families, our spirituality, extra Torah study, our communities, our progress from week to week. We are to emulate God’s “rest” after a “work week” and experience that which we’ve created.</p>
<p>People who need a Digital Sabbath are welcome to join our eternal Sabbath. But we are the Sabbath hipsters. We were doing it before it was cool and for reasons far more eternal than escaping notifications from Facebook and emails.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are two elements to turning off. One part is to breathe. Experience life. Enjoy life. The other part is tuning in to others. I think both needs must be satisfied. We need our own space and we need to give ourselves to others.</p>
<p>Shabbos actually manages to give us both. Proper prayer is akin to meditation. It focuses us. It’s a way of returning to ourselves. Use the extended prayer service as a way to come in contact with yourself. We follow that up with a kiddush or a Shabbos meal. This is our opportunity to interact with others without distraction. There are no work distractions, there are no cooking distractions, there are no e-distractions. We enjoy our friends and family and give them the human interaction that we all crave. Spend that time well. It&#8217;s not to wasted.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that we take care of both of these needs to maximize our Shabbos experience. Take time for yourself and make time for others. Eliminate the distractions and together we celebrate another week of progress and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Shabbos has a way of celebrating the end of the previous week and setting the the tone for the following week. Digital Sabbaths are great, but the original Sabbath is even better. If you are ever looking for a unique Shabbos experience, come join us at the Shul on the Beach in Venice.</p>
