				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago I received a complimentary copy of Rabbi Berel Wein&#8217;s recently published memoir, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592643485/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592643485&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=G2N52SQGULXXCV6X">Teach Them Diligently: The Personal Story of a Community Rabbi</a> from Maggid books.  This book was particularly interesting to me because Rabbi Wein played a significant role in my Monsey childhood and is a family friend. I finally had a quiet Shabbos afternoon to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592643485/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592643485&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=G2N52SQGULXXCV6X">Teach Them Diligently: The Personal Story of a Community Rabbi</a>, a short and sweet volume of 161 pages, and I enjoyed it immensely. If you are not going to read the next few paragraphs, just buy the book and read it. Two thumbs up.<span id="more-8463"></span></p>
<p>The book is a collection of Rabbi Wein&#8217;s personal reflections on his own life. We get a brief biographical sketch of his childhood and family life followed by several chapters covering his various careers. Rabbi Wein is known for his wit. In this book he adds some Shakespearian wit by strictly adhering to Hamlet&#8217;s famous aphorism, &#8220;brevity is the soul of wit.&#8221; The book is regrettably superficial at times but we still feel a level of depth and insight into some of Rabbi Wein&#8217;s more memorable and poignant personal stories, observations, and vignettes. Despite its brevity, the reader is rewarded with some excellent insight into the development of American Orthodox Judaism, several excellent anecdotes about Gedolim, a peek into Rabbi Wein&#8217;s heart, and most of all, a strong sense of accomplishment and pride in his achievements. Rabbi Wein has earned the right to bask in the glory of his voluminous accomplishments and he humbly reflects on his public life in his memoir. Reading this book allows us to all share in his glow.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592643485/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592643485&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=2RHAHN7MQBVCTWZ2"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8464" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/81nc2jAuI8L-e1402290444845-379x600.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="81nc2jAuI8L" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>For me, the book held additional meaning. Rabbi Wein has always been a part of my life in some fashion or another. Our family ties precede my birth, but those ancient ties were constantly reinforced in my own lifetime. I davened in his shul so many times, sitting next to my father, mere inches from Rabbi Wein&#8217;s perch in front of the sanctuary at countless Bar Mitzvahs where Rabbi Wein and my father intersected professionally, (and when I wanted the world famous Bais Torah 25 minute from Brachos to Shir Shel Yom shachris). A Wein grandson was even my chavrusah the year I got married.</p>
<p>Reading the book, I began to see professional parallels in my own life. It&#8217;s a testament to the writer of a memoir when a reader can feel a connection to the writer and see their own life and struggles in the writer&#8217;s. I am sure that anyone reading this book will see similar parallels in their own lives, especially readers who sit in the fronts of shuls as pulpit rabbis. But it felt to me that we share even more. I also attended law school and chose to pursue a rabbinic career ahead of a law career. Rabbi Wein actually practiced law for several years before he was hired as a rabbi in Miami. Rabbi Wein arrived at his rabbinic interview wearing lay person clothing, not rabbinic garb. A blue suit matched with a white straw hat perched on his head made for an interesting study in non-conventional rabbinic attire. But that is who he was, so that&#8217;s what he wore. In my own way, I have the same kind of approach to rabbinic garb. Also, Rabbi Wein took Torah from books to the tapes and CDs. I wasn&#8217;t the first rabbi on the Internet, but I embrace this newer way of reaching out my fellow Jews. Perhaps the greatest parallel that I sensed was the way Rabbi Wein was a Modern Orthodox rabbi without a Yeshiva University pedigree. He never quite felt at home with the YU rabbis and the more Charedi rabbis saw Rabbi Wein as an outsider to their Yeshivish community as well. This, despite Rabbi Wein&#8217;s incredibly robust relationships and interactions with so many prominent figures in the Yeshiva world. The book tells of his close ties to Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky as well as his connection to Rabbi Moshe Feinstein and the Satmar Rebbe. But he was still an outsider.</p>
<p>There are some superb &#8220;Gedolim Stories&#8221; in the book. In particular, Rabbi Kamenetsky emerges as kind and compassionate as one aware of his reputation would expect. Classic anecdotes with Reb Moshe and Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinsky are equally refreshing in their humanizing of those two Torah luminaries. I loved Rabbi Kamenetsky&#8217;s compassionate dismantling of a particular superstition in one story and an overzealous religious fervor in another. It was a rare treat to see great men being great in its simplest and most common interpretation.</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, Rabbi Wein&#8217;s disdain for the fake piety and undeserved honor given to the fraudulently pious is impossible to miss. There are several stories in the book that Rabbi Wein cannot contain his disgust for those who dress in sheep&#8217;s clothing but bite with the teeth of a wolf. Similarly, Rabbi Wein has a healthy aversion to Jewish organizations. As he puts it, &#8220;it takes all kind of people, luckily, I am not one of those people.&#8221; It&#8217;s no wonder Rabbi Wein felt this way considering he was asked to speak for the OU Convention one year and the Agudah Convention the next year. Within weeks he was contacted by both organizations requesting that he not speak for the other organization ever again.</p>
<p>Rabbi Wein&#8217;s writing talent shines through in many sections of the book. Clearly, he has a way with words. I particularly loved his description of Monsey in the late 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;There were three groups of Orthodox Jews in Monsey. Two of them &#8211; Hasidic and</em> &#8220;yeshivish&#8221;<em> (originally connected mainly to Bais Medrash Elyon) &#8211; lived primarily &#8220;down the hill&#8221; in lower Monsey. Then there were the more &#8220;modern&#8221; Orthodox Jews, many of them graduates of Yeshiva University, who lived &#8220;up the hill&#8221; (traversed by Maple Avenue) was a formidable climb, both physically and socially</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone from Monsey reading this is grinning and nodding their head right now.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I always took pride in describing where my grandparents lived in Monsey back then. &#8220;You know the hill that people talk about? The one that separates the people up the hill from the people down the hill? My grandparents live <em>on</em> the hill.&#8221; So true.</p>
<p>Rabbi Wein&#8217;s softer side comes through as well. He talks lovingly about courting his wife of 51 years in the beginning of the book and near the end of the book we can sense his broken heart when she passes away suddenly. Some of the tender moments in the book brought me to tears.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to learn from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592643485/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592643485&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=G2N52SQGULXXCV6X">Teach Them Diligently: The Personal Story of a Community Rabbi</a>. There are plenty of lessons for the lay person and the rabbi alike. But I express caution in learning from one man&#8217;s unique life and applying it to our lives. Rabbi Wein is a poster child for Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s <a id="static_txt_preview" style="color: #996633;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017930/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316017930&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=6AALXXMKRVFJMXAN" target="_blank">Outliers: The Story of Success</a>. The world that greeted him was so unlike anything that preceded it and disappeared so quickly that his life truly is well described by the chapter titled &#8220;In the Right Place at the Right Time.&#8221; The incredibly unique groups of teachers, circumstances, good fortune, and rare mix of talent and ambition combined to form one of the most influential and successful Orthodox Jews of the last 100 years.</p>
<p>Although Rabbi Wein&#8217;s life is so atypical, we can all learn from how he made the most of his opportunities. Rabbi Wein snatched every opportunity to succeed that life presented him. I am pretty sure that if we can at least emulate this part of his character, we will also leave behind our own great legacy by the time we are Octogenarians. I can think of few people more worthy of our admiration and adoration than Rabbi Wein. According to Rabbi Wein, his life was an attempt to answer the question, &#8220;how are you going to help rebuild the Jewish people?&#8221; posed by Rabbi Isaac HaLevi Herzog. Indeed, let us all find our own answer to that question.</p>
<p>I highly recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592643485/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592643485&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=G2N52SQGULXXCV6X">Teach Them Diligently: The Personal Story of a Community Rabbi</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Data. The Internet has made data collection easier and the quantification of data simpler. For a while, access to data was a novelty and just presenting a one sided account of some data was exciting. But now, data is so prevalent that understanding and contextualizing data is more interesting. Several websites purporting to analyze data as opposed to pontificate subjectively on topics have cropped up recently.</p>
<p>Perhaps the shift could be simplified by saying we&#8217;ve moved from Malcolm Gladwell and blogging pundits to Nate Silver and thevox.com.</p>
<p>But Orthodox Jewish commentary is basically in the pre-Gladwell era. We don&#8217;t even have any data. And if we did have data, we don&#8217;t even have anyone to analyze it properly. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/02/10/some-lessons-orthodox-judaism-can-learn-from-mormons/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve lamented this before</a>, and note that there has been some headway in our data collection aspirations. In the meantime, we still pontificate and argue from subjective and anecdotal perspectives. There is still value in such discussion, but it&#8217;s all very theoretical and hardly scientific.</p>
<p>Which is why I was so intrigued by this book I noticed (I can&#8217;t remember where) and was eager to devour its data. The book is titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199948658/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199948658&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=FO6EHLMYUPOJ6AFV">Families and Faith: How Religion is Passed Down across Generations</a> and it was worth every penny it cost and every minute I spent reading it.</p>
<p><span id="more-8375"></span></p>
<p>The concept of the book is enough to make me swoon. Imagine talking to 5 generations of American families about their religious identity (or lack thereof) several times over the course of 30 years and tracking their responses along numerous data points. Then taking time to quantify the data and interpret the numbers to produce evidence based opinions on the factors that influence the effectiveness of passing religious traditions from one generation to the next. That&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199948658/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199948658&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=FO6EHLMYUPOJ6AFV">Families and Faith</a>. Every major religion is represented in the data. Non-belief and atheism is also analyzed in the same way belief is analyzed.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/05/05/book-review-families-and-faith/"><img class="alignright wp-image-8376 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/thumbRNS-FAMILIES-FAITH112113.jpg?resize=393%2C600" alt="RNS-FAMILIES-FAITH" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In terms of sheer value, the data in this book is incredibly useful. The numbers in the book are meaningful and the analysis is excellent. People discussed in the book span 125 years. It was an ambitious study when it was conceived over 30 years ago, and the results of the study reflect this ambition. I don&#8217;t think I have ever seen more relevant data on this particular issue. But it&#8217;s not just charts and tables of numbers. The numbers are accompanied by snippets and quotes from thousands of conversations that illuminate the numbers. This was not a survey with questions and answers. The survey is numbers and personal testimony. It tells a very complex and nuanced story of religious tradition. For this reason alone, I think a copy of this belongs in every rabbi&#8217;s library, every Jewish school&#8217;s library, and the library of anyone who cares about the future of Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>You should read the book to see all the numbers and commentary. But in the interest of providing some food for thought, I present some of the most interesting conclusions reached in the study and discussed in the book.</p>
<p>1. <strong>The most important factor in transmitting tradition is the relationship between parents and children</strong>. This is not to say that parents are to blame if a child deviates. This is only to say that children who enjoy a warm, positive relationship with their parents have a much higher rate of keeping the traditions of the parents. Numbers only demonstrate trends and tendencies. When the book identifies this as an important factor, it only means that this is a data point that is more common among those who stay. Of course many who stay dislike their parents and many who leave love their parents. But the numbers are significant enough that this is considered an important factor.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Grandparents matter a lot. </strong>Previous studies failed to identify the influence of grandparents. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199948658/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199948658&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=FO6EHLMYUPOJ6AFV">Families and Faith</a> demonstrates the huge impact that grandparents can have on their grandchildren. Nostalgia and a connection to the old world make a difference in children. This makes it somewhat more difficult for children of Baalei Teshuva who have grandparents antagonistic to the choices of their parents. Support from grandparents makes a big difference. Losing it, makes a big difference too.</p>
<p>3. <strong>God and religion mean different things to different generations. </strong>It&#8217;s predictable, but important to note that the way religious people talk about God and the meaning of their religious experience is different across generations. This is not a factor in whether people stay, but it is important for parents and educators to be aware that the way that they perceive spirituality is likely different than the way their children and students perceive spirituality. Thus, in the interest of good communication, we need know that the language of religious people changes. Reading through the Jewish tradition, this is fairly obvious. Where one generation related to God through <em>piyut, </em>another generation related to God through <em>pilpul. </em>These things change and I think that they tend to change faster now than they changed in the past.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Allowing religious choice encourages children who struggle with religion to return. </strong>To some, this is counter-intuitive. But I think we&#8217;ve all seen this one in action. The more a community tries to clamp down on rebellious teens, the less likely they are to return. I wonder if there is even a single example of actively suppressing rebelliousness that worked out well for the parents. I can&#8217;t think of one. Sometimes there is a brief respite, but the result is usually predictable. But the interesting thing is that when given a choice and an opportunity to explore, there are a significant number of children who return to the religion of their parents over time.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Parents who become more religious while raising their children. </strong>Often, parents will get more involved in religious life or introduce more religious practices into the family life as their grow older. This has a negative effect on children according to the data. Parents experiencing personal growth within their religious lives is part of religious life. But the consequences can be harmful if the parents impose their newfound fervor on their children. I think this is an area that is relevant to Orthodox Jews in particular.</p>
<p>6. Finally, I think this is the hidden message of the entire book. <strong>Parents have as much influence over their children as they have always had</strong><strong>.</strong> In other words, it&#8217;s too common and too easy to say that it&#8217;s harder to raise religious children in 2014 than it was in 1974 or 1914. But the numbers actually say that parents have the same influence they had in the past. The defeatism of throwing up our hands and saying we can&#8217;t win is not admitted defeat. It&#8217;s a false confession.</p>
<p>There is so much more data, discussion, and conclusions in this book of great importance and I think everyone should read it. I really do.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that we can artificially generate the right circumstances to pass faith on to our children. But we can teach the values and practices that make it easier so that over time we have organically cultivated the right environment for transmission of faith.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading this blog for a while, you know that one of the greatest influences in my life was Rabbi Yosef Tendler. I don&#8217;t pretend that he would approve or support everything I say or do. However, I do know that if not for his incredibly positive impact on my life I would be a very different person. Rabbi Tendler put a disproportionate amount of effort into me and I forever grateful for his time, guidance, wisdom, and direction that he provided me. Rabbi Tendler is the only teacher and mentor of mine that is no longer living aside from my grandfathers. Even though I am not in touch with so many of those rabbis and teachers, knowing they are always a phone call away feels different.</p>
<p>When I discovered that a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422614603/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422614603&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank">book</a> about his life had been published I was thrilled. I made the mistake of waiting for it to arrive to the LA bookstores. I never did see it here. But luckily for me, Artscroll sent me a copy for review.<span id="more-8127"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since last read an Artscroll biography. I think the last one I read was about Reb Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-8129" alt="serh" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/serh.jpg?resize=168%2C245" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>My grandfather assisted in the editing of that book and I felt a deep connection to Reb Shraga Feivel through my grandfather. That was at least 12 years ago. So when  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422614603/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422614603&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">I Am Your Servant: The life of Rabbi Yosef Tendler</a> arrived, it was a doubly odd feeling. Not only was it the first Artscroll biography I had read in a very long time, but it was the first Artscroll biography I ever read about someone I knew. It was the first biography of any kind that I had read about someone I knew, someone I loved, someone I missed.</p>
<p>Usually we read biographies to learn about important figures. That&#8217;s not why I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422614603/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422614603&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">I Am Your Servant</a>. I read it to bring Rabbi Tendler back from the dead. I read it so that I would experience his criticism and wisdom posthumously. I read it to make sure the book told the story of my Rabbi Tendler. I read it to feel the love of a student for a teacher I was missing since his passing. And I read it feel the pain I felt at his passing all over again.</p>
<p>I picked up the book at about 10:00 PM on Friday night. I read until I finished the book in a fountain of tears at about 2 AM. I loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422614603/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422614603&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">I Am Your Servant</a>. It was perfect for me.</p>
<p>A combination of shock and flattery coursed through my veins when I saw that I was quoted in the book.<br />
<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/kLe3LoNR_l/embed/" height="710" width="612" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Then I was moved even more when I discovered that <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/10/the-hardest-part-of-saying-goodbye-to-rabbi-tendler/" target="_blank">an article I wrote about his passing was quoted in full at the end of the book</a>. I am honored to even play the smallest role in this book and I thank the author, Rabbi Akiva Tendler, for including me. (I&#8217;ll forgive the &#8220;tie anecdote&#8221; that was in the book that didn&#8217;t credit me. I am pretty sure it came from me because I was one of two people who saw the story happen.)</p>
<p>Thankfully, the book didn&#8217;t make Rabbi Tendler into something he was not. It was honest and real. There were no rebbeshe stories or supernatural episodes. It was just straight, plain, and simple. Torah and unadulterated truth. That was Rabbi Tendler. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422614603/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422614603&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">I Am Your Servant</a> is not the stereotypical Artscroll hagiography.</p>
<p>The book is divided into short chapters and takes two formats. In italics we read Rabbi Tendler&#8217;s discourses and notes. In standard type we read stories and musings as retold by his students and family. It works very well. The two formats complement each other. The anecdotes are more prominent and feel more like Rabbi Tendler than the Torah and Mussar essays. That&#8217;s mostly because we always retell the great stories and rarely tell over Rabbi Tendler&#8217;s Torah.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid that people who never experienced Rabbi Tendler won&#8217;t fully appreciate many of the stories. Rabbi Tendler was someone that really only made sense after you got to know him and hear from him for a while. He slowly invaded your thinking. It was not instant. So for his students that lived it, the book will open a floodgate of memories. Even the ones we never heard are so typical of Rabbi Tendler that we feel like we were there. Reading the book was like being back in Mechina and inspired me to work on his most famous dictum, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Waste Your Life.&#8221; Yes, there is a chapter so titled.</p>
<p>Rabbi Tendler was non-conventional but also very consistent. He did things differently. His philosophy and way of life were so genuine. The book will transmit that message to readers who are newcomers to Rabbi Tendler&#8217;s world. Readers will see how different his way of thinking was from others. Much of his hashkafa is common to moderate yeshiva lifestyle, but his presentation and his unique twist is what set him apart. The book captures this magnificently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll share three of my favorite moments in the book to illustrate.</p>
<p>One time Rabbi Tendler was being solicited to take sides in a rabbinic dispute (<em>l&#8217;shem shamayim</em>, obviously). The book doesn&#8217;t say this, but the Gadol who was soliciting Rabbi Tendler was someone senior to him and someone he was expected to respect and revere. The other Gadol in the dispute was from a worldview less Rabbi Tendler-ish. A letter came from the Gadol and one of Rabbi Tendler&#8217;s sons noticed the return address belonged to a real Gadol. Rabbi Tendler took the envelope and tossed it in the trash without even looking at it. His son was flabbergasted. But that letter is from a Gadol! Rabbi Tendler responded that he knew the Gadol wanted to involve him in a machlokes and he wasn&#8217;t interested. End.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s classic Rabbi Tendler. He did what was right no matter who was involved. He was his own person and he had the confidence to proudly live Torah his way.</p>
<p>When Rabbi Tendler&#8217;s daughters were discussing the popular <em>segulos</em> for finding a <em>shidduch,</em> Rabbi Tendler overheard their conversation. He commented &#8220;the best <em>segulah</em> for finding a <em>shidduch</em> is taking the garbage out for your mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rabbi Tendler was not interested in the latest segulos or seeking blessings from Rebbes and Gedolim. He just did the right thing and demanded the same from the people in his world. There were no shortcuts. This was the best way to find the treasures of a Torah life.</p>
<p>The third anecdote supports this as well. Rabbi Tendler was talking to his daughter about her job as a teacher. She asked what Rabbi Tendler what he thought was the most important character trait for a teacher. Rabbi Tendler said the most important middah is to be <em>ehrlich,</em> have integrity. &#8220;How does one become <em>ehrlich?&#8221;</em> she asked. In classic Rabbi Tendler fashion, he answered &#8220;be <em>ehrlich!&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not so complicated. Just do it. That was Rabbi Tendler.</p>
<p>There are so many stories that show how Rabbi Tendler went against the grain and did what was right despite the expectations of others. Talmidim will nod in agreement. People who didn&#8217;t know Rabbi Tendler will wonder if these stories could possibly be true. I assure you, they are true. That was the magic of Rabbi Tendler and the book captures this beautifully. Much of the hashkafa of the book doesn&#8217;t feel like my hashkafa anymore. It&#8217;s okay. People change. The world changes. It doesn&#8217;t matter. Most of it is timeless and universal. The parts that no longer work for me are beautiful ideas too. I&#8217;ve just forged a new path. Interestingly, it is the path that the book ascribes to Rabbi Tendler&#8217;s father and Rabbi Tendler himself before he went to Lakewood. But regardless, it all sounds so familiar and comfortable to me. I loved every moment of the journey I experienced while reading  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422614603/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422614603&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">I Am Your Servant</a>.</p>
<p>The book ends with a chapter full of touching memories of family, friends, and students compiled after Rabbi Tendler passed away. It was the perfect way to end a book about a man who lives on in the hearts and minds of so many people. Even in death, Rabbi Tendler lives on. This final chapter had me crying my brains out. They were tears of love and tears of longing. I really appreciated the stroke of genius to include these emotional memories in the book. It was cathartic and it felt good to cry for our loss once again.</p>
<p>I would love to share more stories and wisdom in this review, but I prefer you buy the book and read it for yourself. <em>Buy the book on Amazon here: <strong> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422614603/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422614603&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">I Am Your Servant</a>.</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A book like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038553809X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=038553809X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Cut Me Loose: Sin and Salvation After My Ultra-Orthodox Girlhood</a> by Leah Vincent is going to elicit predictable reactions. Many of these reactions will come from people who have not even read the book. But they already know Leah and her story. These knee-jerk reactions will come from two seemingly opposite camps. Those who have left Orthodox Judaism will see Leah as a heroine with a story that may reflect their own. Those who are living Orthodox Jewish lives will see Leah as a villain or victim and use her history or story to discredit her. What follows might be one of the only reviews of the book from an Orthodox Jew who recommends <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038553809X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=038553809X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Cut Me Loose</a> but not the life of its protagonist.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering, why I would recommend, or even acknowledge Cut Me Loose please read on.<span id="more-8070"></span></p>
<p>The book is different than other books in this niche. Other books tell stories of religion and faith, obedience and rebellion. Cut Me Loose had so little of that. Instead it was a book about a 17 year old girl transitioning from one life to a new life. The backdrop to this story begins with her first life as a Yeshivishe out of town girl, and concludes with her successful integration into the secular world. But it&#8217;s almost incidental. The real story is on the inside. While it&#8217;s true that part of her story involved negative associations with Orthodox Judaism, that is not the essence of her story.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8071" alt="elle-01-orthodox-v-mdn" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/elle-01-orthodox-v-mdn.jpg?resize=320%2C480" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Reading Leah&#8217;s difficult journey is a bitter pill to swallow. Too many terrible things happened to her, or as was often the case, she did to herself. I know Leah, and it was painfully voyeuristic, almost too voyeuristic, to read the details of her darkest moments. No one should ever have to endure the challenges Leah writes about in her book. The world can be a cruel place, and some people encounter more cruelty in their lives than others.</p>
<p>There is a negative stereotype that people who leave Orthodox Judaism are destined to a life of drugs, masochism, and meaningless sexual encounters. Unfortunately, Leah seemingly does everything she can to perpetuate these stereotypes. She was all alone in a giant scary world at 17 years old. It&#8217;s insane when you think about it. Her deterioration was to be expected. It&#8217;s almost like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Too much of our education relies upon demonizing the outside. This has many negative consequences. For some, it just becomes their guide map as they clumsily plod along in a new world.</p>
<p>Incredibly, this is despite the fact that most yeshivish people actually live very much in the secular world. In fact, I would say that in many way they are more like Modern Orthodoxy than Hasidic Jews in this respect. Yet, all their engagement almost handicaps them because they are fooled into thinking they get the outside world and when they realize they don&#8217;t, it can be far worse than the experience of someone who knows that they are clueless out there.  This is a unique feature of the yeshivish community.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Leah&#8217;s story has a happy ending. I cried when I read the last page. When Leah is able to succeed in her new world, we all breathe a collective sigh of relief. But when she thrives in that world, our hearts soar. The kind of success we are talking about is the kind of success that religious life gifts to some people. But for those who live on the outside of that world, a world devoid of the familiar structure and markers of success, it can sometimes take more to live a proud, gratifying life. It took a lot for Leah to get there, but when we get to the end of this story we can see that Leah has arrived. It&#8217;s a genuinely happy moment and validates this incredible book.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">A memoir will inevitably stray from precision. Memories are subjective and somewhat fluid. Leah&#8217;s life may or may not have been exactly the way she describes. That&#8217;s not really the point. She still experienced her life in the way it was described. Certainly, much of the book rings true to my </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">ears. Not because I have first hand information about Leah&#8217;s story, but because I have anecdotes from my own life and the lives of others that reflect similar experiences.</span></p>
<p>I want to address two things from inside the book and one thing that&#8217;s happening outside the book.</p>
<p>There was one line in the book that gave me chills. At one point Leah&#8217;s family is instructed by their parents not to acknowledge Leah and basically ignore her in a time of great difficulty for Leah. The argument is that Leah is only doing it for attention and therefore, the logic goes, they should not give her any attention and she will stop.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree. If someone is seeking attention, the response is not to ignore their antics and let it all sort itself out. Some might say that the proper respond would be to ascertain the reason for the attention seeking behavior. This is admittedly better than ignoring it altogether, but I think this misses the mark as well.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the best thing to do when someone is seeking attention is to give them attention. And I don&#8217;t mean that we should give them the exact sort of attention that they are &#8220;asking for&#8221; with their negative behavior. Rather, if someone is craving attention and they are acting on it, I think we can assume that this person is dealing with some sort of pain that needs love and care. We may not be able to fix their pain, but we must acknowledge it. In fact, this is exactly what was happening in Leah&#8217;s story. She did need attention. And by attention, we mean love. We mean care. We mean affection. We mean any sort of familial bond. She did something stupid to try and get their attention. As immature as it might be to seek attention with immature behavior, it&#8217;s at least as immature to think that if someone is doing something for attention then I am not obligated to give them any love or care. If someone craves attention, then the proper thing to do is to love them and empathize with them.</p>
<p>This is important as a parenting and educational tactic. Sometimes children act out as they seek attention. We need to be aware that if they are seeking attention, they might just need some extra loving and we would be remiss if we ignored their pain simply because they &#8220;are asking for attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly, when we are dealing with those who have left Orthodox Judaism it is too easy to say &#8220;they are just looking for attention&#8221; and summarily dismiss them. It seems that if they are seeking attention then they actually do need love and empathy. Why not give it to them?</p>
<p>The second thing that must be addressed is mental health. Clearly, Leah&#8217;s mental health was a mess throughout the book. She required serious help. In the frum community we know where to go to ask a question about halacha. There is an entire hierarchal system for handling questions of religious significance. But we don&#8217;t have a mechanism for addressing the needs or pleas of those who are in need of emotional help. Whether it&#8217;s victims of abuse or any other reason, or even without a reason, there will always be questions of mental health in all communities. We need to work on this. We need better awareness in our schools. Teachers and administrators need to know the signs of mental health issues and they need a plan for handling issues.</p>
<p>Too many things in our community are brushed aside because authority figures are not concerned enough with mental health. The social stigma is too great and the shidduch resume price too dear, for us to be forthcoming and proactive on mental health. That must change first. Then we can begin the process of training those who see our children and teens on a regular basis in best practices. We are woefully behind in all of this. Part of the reason for this could be the over reliance on Torah for things not actually in the Torah. Another part of it is a skepticism of science, especially softer sciences. Whatever the reason, we should do as much as we can to prevent our children from having to face the demons that Leah had to defeat.</p>
<p>The one thing outside the book is the inevitable backlash. Defenders of her family and especially of her father are expected to come to their defense. Full credit to Leah for not using her family name in her book or even in her life. It&#8217;s clear that she wants to disassociate from them but also to disassociate them from the book and her life. I think it&#8217;s admirable not to want to stick it to them. But still, people will say Leah is a liar. Others will say she&#8217;s clearly nuts. Personally, I don&#8217;t think so. But I also think such discussion is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Issues are raised in this book. Whether they happened to Leah or not, they exist. The worst response to criticism is attacking the critic. Yet, that&#8217;s precisely what tends to happen. This is really not about Leah or her family. It&#8217;s about handling the real issues raised in this and other books. It&#8217;s about how to react to those who experience anxiety in the frum world and how we treat those who have left. It&#8217;s about providing our children with the tools they need to survive in our world but also outside our world. These issues don&#8217;t disappear if you discredit Leah Vincent. They still need to be addressed.</p>
<p>So I ask that if you encounter this sort of criticism of her book, you politely ask that they keep the conversation substantive and not ad hominem. Instead, invite a discussion about the issues and elicit thoughtful responses. That would be so much better.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038553809X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=038553809X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Cut Me Loose</a> for adults who read secular novels. If you don&#8217;t read secular novels, the graphic content might take you somewhere you&#8217;d rather not go. But if you are the kind of person who would watch a movie, a TV show (even on Netflix), or read a lot, this book should be added to your list.</p>
<p>But why do I recommend this book? Is it to promote the idea that leaving Orthodox Judaism is a great idea? Not at all. Some people think that people who read books of this nature will be more likely to leave Orthodox Judaism. I disagree.</p>
<p>In my experience, the thing that is most harmful for people on the fringe of Orthodox Judaism is not reading about criticism or people who leave. In fact, I think it&#8217;s the opposite. Pretending that there are no issues or sweeping issues under the carpet is their biggest gripe. Like most things, it&#8217;s not the crime, it&#8217;s the coverup. We cannot be afraid to address our issues. It&#8217;s impossible to read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038553809X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=038553809X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Cut Me Loose</a> without considering how we can do better. We owe it to ourselves to reflect on our failings. The voice in this book is not one of unrepentant critic. It is the voice of someone who so badly wanted to stay in the fold but just couldn&#8217;t. The title is about herself. She is asking her own self to cut herself loose. It&#8217;s a clever double entendre that you&#8217;ll understand after you read the book and you&#8217;ll see that leaving was her last resort. She needed to leave because it was too hurtful and harmful to stay. The latent criticisms in the book are coming from a place of yearning and disappointment, not from a place of hatred and resentment. On one level, reading Cut Me Loose can serve as a reflection of our culture to inspire improvement.</p>
<p>Further, seeing others who have struggled with matters of faith and observance is actually helpful to most people. The feelings of isolation and loneliness that accompany struggling with observance can be even worse than the actual struggles. Giving a voice to the struggles can be so comforting. Simply the acknowledgment that there are challenges and pain can mean everything to those dealing with these issues. Knowing you&#8217;re not alone or that you&#8217;re not crazy can be the greatest gift of all. Cut Me Loose can certainly help in this regard.</p>
<p>Finally, the thing that I believe we must give all our brothers and sisters who have left Orthodox Judaism is acknowledgment. We may not be able to heal their wounds, or fix their pain, but we can let them know that we are aware of their wounds and that we can see their pain. Sometimes the best thing we can do is tell those who have left that we hear them. We hear their stories. We hear their struggles. We hear their criticism. I recommend this book because we need to tell those who have left three of the most powerful words in the English language: &#8220;I hear you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps, through increased discussion of our issues, awareness of common struggles, and acknowledgement of pain, we can do our part to help the next Leah avoid the trauma she experienced. Perhaps we can ensure that a daughter does not lose her parents and siblings. Perhaps we can see those who have left, as valuable contributors to society even if they don&#8217;t live the life we chose for ourselves. It&#8217;s a lot to put on a book. But Leah&#8217;s exquisite writing just might be the thing to do it.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimers: I received an advance copy of the book for review. I also purchased a copy of the book to support Leah. If you give me a good reason to send you my extra copy, it&#8217;s yours. I&#8217;ll choose a winner in a few days. </em><em>As an Amazon Affiliate, I receive a small commission of all book sales generated by the links in this article.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, my father told me he was reading a very interesting book about scandals and hidden stories from the Chasidic world called <em>Ne’echaz B’Svach</em>. I wanted to read it too, but I don’t have the Hebrew skills to read an academic book in modern Hebrew.</p>
<p>This summer I saw a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611681944/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1611681944&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Untold Tales of the Hasidim: Crisis and Discontent in the History of Hasidism</a> by David Assaf, that looked like it could be a translation of the Hebrew book, I asked Tuvia if it was in fact an English version of Ne’echaz B’Svach. Before he finished saying yes I grabbed it and was swiping my credit card.</p>
<p>The book did not disappoint. Whenever I read a good book, I dog-ear the pages with lines or ideas that seem important or interesting to me. I have never read a book where I dog-eared more pages. It’s almost impossible to do a proper review on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611681944/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1611681944&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Untold Tales of the Hasidim</a> because there is just too much that I want to say.<span id="more-7878"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="//instagram.com/p/hMK600NRxs/embed/" height="710" width="612" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The book is divided into unrelated chapters about specific incidents in the Chasidic world spanning two centuries. The common denominator among the stories is a active effort to limit the knowledge of these stories by Chasidic groups and leaders as well as an effort to reinterpret the stories as less unsavory than the true facts would indicate.</p>
<p>The objective of the book is to explore these stories based on facts and rumor, as well as to understand the various reinterpretations and retellings of these stories. But for what purpose? In the author’s own words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“The ability to handle unpleasant episodes in a critical fashion and the willingness to consider change, or even to pay a price for mistakes, mark an optimistic, proud, and confident society. A society in crisis, or one suffering from a lack of confidence or self-esteem, tends to adopt a defensive attitude toward criticism and a hesitant one toward the past, viewing the exposure of its secrets as posing a mortal danger to its stability.”</em></p>
<p>In other words, by sweeping dirt under the rug we demonstrate a lack of maturity that poses a much more basic risk to our way of life than the actual incidents themselves. It’s never the crime, it’s always the cover up. Later in the first chapter, Assaf notes that the Haredi media glosses over the issues in its own backyard to protect the reputation and good standing of the community. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/06/02/reputation-obsession-taking-tov-shem-mshemen-tov-a-good-name-is-better-than-good-oil-to-the-next-level/" target="_blank">Reputation Obsession</a>) As Rabbi Horowitz has noted, this is more like Pravda and less like the New York Times.</p>
<p>There are seven chapters in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611681944/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1611681944&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Untold Tales of the Hasidim</a>. The first is a general introduction and overview of the methodology and purpose of the book. The next six chapters are each devoted to one episode.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611681944/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1611681944&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7881" alt="9781611681949_p0_v1_s260x420" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9781611681949_p0_v1_s260x420.jpg?resize=255%2C400" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Of the six, I loved two of them and I enjoyed two others. The remaining two were just alright, but still absolutely worth reading.</p>
<p>My favorites were the final two chapters. Chapter six deals with Rabbi Menacham Mendel Friedman of Itscan (early 20th century). He was a Rebbe in training when he died at age 54 and also a Renaissance Chasid. That sounds almost impossible, but it is true. Rabbi Friedman was basically a Maskil type of Rebbe. He studied and loved art, literature, science, and philosophy. His Torah works are unlike any other Torah works written by Chasidic Rebbes in that they are littered with more modern interpretations of Talmudic statements and progressive ideas about Orthodox Judaism. Yet, he maintained a steadfast commitment to Torah and Mitzvos as well as a deep passion for its survival and growth. He forcefully condemns the fools who believe in superstition and the ignorant leadership that was in his opinion, corrupt. He calls religious zeal a plague and for a very stark separation of religion and state in politics.</p>
<p>This was a man who could have started a movement of Chasidus that adapted and changed with the times. A Chasidus that embraced secular knowledge and engagement. But he died young and his followers were too few to amount to a proper Chasidic movement.</p>
<p>Of course, his books are no longer considered acceptable in some circles. A letter in the Yated Ne&#8217;eman in Israel publicly denounced his writings as &#8220;problematic&#8221; and Rabbi Friedman&#8217;s works are unlikely to influence contemporary Chasidic communities as they were intended.</p>
<p>The last chapter of the book is mostly just a translation of a letter written by a Belz Rebbe in training (early 20th century). The son in law of the Belz Rebbe wrote a heartfelt confession about his doubts and antipathy toward the Chasidic mode of dress and lifestyle. He believes in God and in Judaism, but he cannot endure the narrow straits of the Belz life, especially in the court of the Rebbe. The pain in his words leaps off the page. It&#8217;s a rare peek into the mind of a skeptical 20 year old Chasid who is stuck in his life because he does not want to hurt his mother. He knows that if he leaves she will bear the brunt of his defection. She does not deserve that, he reasons, so he stays. By all accounts, he stays and succeeds. No indication that he had doubts or misgivings about his lifestyle exists, other than his confession.</p>
<p>He writes that the first Hasidim were righteous people. But the Hasids of his day were &#8220;wheeling and dealing&#8221;. The Hasids come to the rebbe to pay a fee and have miracles performed on their behalf. There is no growth, there is no soul, there is no virtue. Interestingly enough, his sisters were much more worldly (this illustrates the need that was being addressed by Sarah Schenirer) and they provided him a safe haven to be himself.</p>
<p>In his letter, he describes some of the ascetic customs in his world that were treated an incontrovertible law. Men and women shaved their heads before the wedding. Women were forbidden from wearing wigs. He wears a shtreimel, she wears a scarf and clothing that was in style during the era of Chmielnitzki. He writes that it&#8217;s objectively a hilarious sight but because it is his future it makes him cry. At the end of his letter, he expresses hope that he will grow in the court of Belz and be able to influence his world to modify their social strictures.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious why these two characters were my favorites. They represent some of the struggles of people I deal with on a regular basis. Their struggles are not over, they are just as prominent today as they have ever been. It&#8217;s helpful for those people to find comfort in the works of these great rabbis and perhaps hope that the Renaissance Rebbe and inside reformer will return to Chasidic and Charedi Judaism today.</p>
<p>The two chapters I enjoyed were about Moshe the son of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liady and Rabbi Akiva Shalom Chajes. The two that appealed least to me were about the Seer of Lublin and the battle against Bratslav Chasidim.</p>
<p>There is so much more to discuss in this book. It&#8217;s packed with discussion points that I would love to engage, but it&#8217;s really too much for a review. I will just make one more point.</p>
<p>Recently we&#8217;ve been hearing about turf type wars in Israel between followers or Gedolim. We&#8217;ve known about Chasidic turf wars for decades as well. It seems that this might be deeply rooted in tradition. At one point there was an arms race to conquer cities and towns in the Ukraine and incorporate them under the flag of a Rebbe. Violence was not uncommon and thuggery was the norm. People who did not adhere or acquiesce were deported, isolated, punished, or excommunicated. This is all considered background information for one of the chapters in the book. It&#8217;s the scandal of that chapter. It&#8217;s the socio-political backdrop. When we read about it in the past we shake our heads and wonder how this was acceptable. But are we not seeing the same things today? What will history say about us who watch as this kind of behavior is found in our circles?</p>
<p>This is why history is so important. We need to learn from our past and correct mistakes. We need to know what our past mistakes were in order to correct them.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll read about several mistakes and anti-social patterns in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611681944/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1611681944&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Untold Tales of the Hasidim</a>. It is our hope that we use the lessons of history and build a better future for Orthodox Judaism and the world.</p>

What do I know?</p>
<p>Before I even cracked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> open I had a basic idea of what to expect. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is designed to be an avant garde hagaddah. It is artistic in an almost postmodern way, it is typographically pleasing, the commentary is meant to inspire American Jews, and it was not orthodox. The commentary was written by Jeffrey Goldberg, Lemony Snicket, Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, and Nathaniel Deutsch. The translation was done by Nathan Englander. The hagaddah was edited by  Jonathan Safran Foer.</p>
<p>One of the things I was looking for in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> was whether it would be acceptable to orthodox Jews. Was there anything that would offend the orthodox Jewish adherence to halacha and general worldview? Another thing I wondered was if the commentary was any good without considering the blood pressure of orthodox Jews. The last thing I wanted to see about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> was if I would enjoy its presentation of the haggadah and Seder experience.</p>
<p>So on Shabbos afternoon I read through the whole thing.<span id="more-5315"></span> The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> has three basic functions. There is the text of the haggadah in the original Hebrew plus a contemporary English translation. There is a running timeline of Jewish history with a focus on Passover, that is completely independent of the hagaddah and Passover narrative that runs through the haggadah. There is also a collection of essays and food for thought during the highlights of the haggadah. Throughout the haggadah, instructions and laws are outlined and they are accurate enough. The specific amounts of the portions is not precise. They are not wrong. They are just vague.</p>
<p>My impressions of the text and translation is overwhelmingly positive. The text is true to the orthodox Jewish tradition. This was reassuring. I didn&#8217;t know what to expect, but since the Seder has taken on many different iterations throughout modernity, I had a healthy concern that the text would be different than what I was used to. Fortunately, this is not an issue at all.</p>
<p>My next area of concern was the translation. I must say that I was thoroughly impressed with the translation as well. It is a combination of beautiful English, devotion to tradition, and appropriate modern adjustments. One novel translation was in the response to the Wicked Son. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> translates this section by saying (emphasis mine) &#8220;&#8230;And by divorcing himself from the community he denies <em>our very essence. </em>Moreover, you must <em>blunt the bite of his words</em>, by telling him&#8230;&#8221; This is not the exact translation that most orthodox Jews would use, but it is true to the text and insightful. A second example of a novel translation is found in &#8220;V&#8217;Hi She&#8217;amda&#8221;. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds a poetic nuance in &#8220;For it was not one alone who stood over us, a heel on our necks, bent on our annihilation&#8230;&#8221; I found that one to be a nice touch. One last thing that stuck out was the adjustment from the oft used &#8220;simple son&#8221; to the &#8220;artless son&#8221;. This is perhaps no better than &#8220;simple&#8221; but &#8220;simple&#8221; horribly simplistic as well. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds one section of text that I had not seen previously. At the time that we fill the &#8220;fifth cup&#8221; and open the door for Shfoch Chamascha, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds a couple of verses from Tanach about Elijah the Prophet. I had not seen that before. It offends me, but only slightly, because the idea that Elijah the Prophet visits us when we open the door for Shfoch Chamascha is of questionable vintage and certainly not universally held. All in all, the text and translations were outstanding.</p>
<p>The most problematic part of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> for orthodox Jews is the &#8220;timeline&#8221;. It is highly academic and may, at times, offend orthodox sensibilities. Further, its focus on secular Jewish accomplishments are of little to no value to most orthodox Jewish Seders. One would be hard pressed to actually find anything that would be called &#8220;kefira&#8221; in the timeline, but I can see it being a source of discomfort for many orthodox Jews. I liked most of it.</p>
<p>As for the commentary, it was a lot better than I expected. The gist of the commentary could best be described as a fresh, relevant commentary. It is heavy on take-away lessons that apply in 2012 and light on rabbinic interpretation. However the rabbis of the Talmud and beyond do make several appearances.</p>
<p>If I had to point to its biggest flaw, I would say that at times it is too irreverent of God. Orthodox Jews will cringe at a few of the essays because they paint a picture of God that is not completely in sync with the contemporary orthodox Jewish views of God and His role in the world.</p>
<p>Still, many of the essays portray excellent ideas written in excellent prose that will surely spur a discussion of the haggadah that is familiar to orthodox Jews. For example, speaking of being &#8220;chosen&#8221;, one essay proclaims &#8220;Chosenness can sometimes feel like loneliness; a burden. Perhaps it is for this reason, the haggadah reminds us that our chosenness is an expression of love and a source for rejoicing.&#8221; Sounds like something an orthodox rabbi would say. Commenting on our statement that &#8220;today we are slaves&#8221; the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> asks the obvious question: But we are not slaves today? And answers that our impoverishment is our inability to do all the good that we want to do in our lives. If I told you that was from R&#8217; Yisrael Salanter, you would believe me. But it is not. It is from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a>. Another insight that sounds like a classic is the proposal that the plague that kills all the firstborns of Egypt is a &#8220;measure for measure&#8221; for the Egyptian decree to drown all the baby boys into the Nile. I am sure that others have said this as well. The point is that the commentary sometimes takes on the persona of the traditional orthodox Jewish commentators. There are other nice little &#8220;vorts&#8221; sprinkled throughout the commentary. Like the parallel between the hiding of the Afikomen and the hiding of Moshe as a baby that led to our salvation.</p>
<p>But there are two other kinds of commentary in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> that are bound to rankle some orthodox Jewish sensibilities. One is justified and the other might not be. There are a very small number of essays that may be objectively problematic. For example, one essay proposes that just like us, sometimes God forgets about people other than Himself. Ouch. But other than that, the irreverence and nonchalant tone about God and the Passover story are rarely objectively offensive, if at all.</p>
<p>The most common form of commentary in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is an anathema to most orthodox Jewish Seders, I think. That is, an attempt to take the lessons of the Seder and apply them to society at large, particularly, with a Tikkun Olam flavor. Personally, I think orthodox Jews should not recoil at the mere mention of Tikkun Olam, but many do. For example, one essay remarks that Shifra and Puah are the first examples of &#8220;civil disobedience&#8221;. This is a great point and definitely something to think about. However, few orthodox Jews will find meaning in spending precious moments at the Seder talking about it. Another essay tells a great story about Palestinian prisoners eating matzah on Passover because that is what they were served and invites questions about prison, the Intifada, and Israel. One humorous comparison pits Elijah the Prophet against Santa Claus. Both &#8220;visit&#8221; homes but Santa is forced to go through the Chimney. We stand up and open the door for Elijah. Again, a great conversation starter, but not the kind of conversation that one would expect at an orthodox Jewish Seder. But then again, maybe it should be. Our Seders are so focused on the past and interpretations from the past. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> has some great ways to bring the discussion into 2012 and that might be a good thing for some orthodox Jewish Seders.</p>
<p>In general, the preference of orthodox Jews is to quote rabbis and Torah scholars at the Seder. But as Maimonides famously said,&#8221;<a href="http://efink.tumblr.com/post/7246029090/maimonides-truth" target="_blank">Hear truth from whoever says it</a>&#8220;, I see nothing wrong with including the thoughts and ideas of a few American Jews who are not rabbis or even orthodox.</p>
<p>My only real critique is that in an attempt to be cool and hip, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> makes you turn the book on its side to read the essays and on its other side to read the timeline. Maybe I just don&#8217;t get it. But it is odd and quite annoying. I don&#8217;t see how it enhances the experience.</p>
<p>The verdict is that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is <em>acceptable</em> for orthodox Jews. It has some things to offer that will undoubtably improve your orthodox Jewish Seder. It has other things that will get ignored, but that may not be for the best. Some parts should be ignored, and that is okay too. I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> for most orthodox Jewish readers. If you want to avoid the most problematic essay skip the one that starts &#8220;God. who supposedly knows everything,&#8221;. Otherwise, to my eyes, the rest of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is completely safe. It may seem strange to discuss some of the things that are in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is wrong or a waste of time.</p>

It is unorthodox. It is a rejection. But I did not find it scandalous. Not at all.</p>
<p>There is so much about this book that needs to be discussed. Let&#8217;s get a bit of insignificant criticism out of the way. For starters, I found the writing decent. Not excellent. It got better as the book progressed, but the early chapters were tedious in my opinion. The writing is over-descriptive to a fault. Too many sentences have too many adjectives and adverbs. The book doesn&#8217;t allow the reader any imagination. There&#8217;s no room for the reader to breath. It&#8217;s sensory overload. It&#8217;s almost like the author is trying too hard to prove herself as a good writer. Personally, I found it quite annoying.</p>
<p>The story is unremarkable. Shorter version of the book: Girl raised by her grandparents because her mother is a lesbian who left the community and her father is mentally ill has high anxiety and feels constrained by the limiting lifestyle of her community eventually leaves the community. It&#8217;s not a story we haven&#8217;t heard before nor is it a story we will not hear again.</p>
<p>The truth is that anyone with high anxiety will not have an easy time in any tight-knit, insular community. It&#8217;s not really that chasidic Judaism didn&#8217;t work for Deborah. It&#8217;s that her difficult childhood and personality didn&#8217;t work well in the high pressure society of chasidic Judaism. She probably would have been fine in a more moderate form of orthodox Judaism. Unfortunately for her, she was born into extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>Honestly, there was nothing &#8220;scandalous&#8221; in the book. (I will address the one scandal that has been manufactured at the end of this post).<span id="more-5177"></span> In other words, the book, fairly accurately describes the life of a chasidic girl in Williamsburg. It is insular. Education is placed at a minimum. Marriage is the goal of childhood, motherhood is the goal of adulthood. This is no scandalous. This is fact.</p>
<p>There are in fact, renegade renegade mikva attendants. There are libido charged teenage boys who are inappropriate toward girls (and other boys). There are stories of talking fish. People did burn their wigs. Secular books are frowned upon. Superstitions are rampant. People gossip. Especially about young married couples. There is abuse and it is covered up. There is prejudice against members of other chasidic sects and certainly against non-chasidic Jews, especially modern orthodox Jews and Sephardic Jews. Strange tales like eating pig will make you vomit are told. These are just the expected social conventions of the insular chasidic community. Nothing to see here.</p>
<p>But are these items an indictment of the entire chasidic community? Certainly not. Bad people and dumb ideas exist everywhere. The biggest gripe I have is simply the imaginary principle that there are no bad people or dumb ideas in the community. There are and knowing there are goes a long way to fixing those people and ideas.</p>
<p>The book brought me to tears twice. For a sap like me, that is not a good showing. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a><img alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> made me cry a ton of times. Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen: The Hidden Lives of Hasidic Rebels</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0807036277&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> moved me to tears a bunch of times. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> was not an emotional book. The only moments for me were the birth of her child and the when she and her son come to grips with the fact that the unhappy, broken, marriage is over. That&#8217;s it. The rest felt a bit detached and unremarkable.</p>
<p>But I like to find social commentary and universal lessons in this kind of book and I think there are some important issues the book raises.</p>
<p>Deborah&#8217;s personality is to question and to learn. In her community this is a dangerous trait. Her first step off the path was learning Talmud. That&#8217;s an innocent curiosity in most orthodox communities, even for a girl. But Deborah had to hide it. She couldn&#8217;t ask questions about what she had learned. With this her rebellion began.</p>
<p>Although Deborah relates to her grandmother as a rebel. I don&#8217;t think she realized how special her grandfather was. At least, what is recorded in the book paints Zaidy as a good guy. He avoids the Satmar politics. He is willing to read a newspaper after 9/11. He doesn&#8217;t believe in superstition and stories like the talking fish in New Square. He is also a bit of a rebel. In my eyes, Zaidy is a reasonable guy throughout most of the book. What&#8217;s unfortunate is one negative portrayal made its way onto the book jacket. But other than that incident, he seems to be a good guy. I think that his independence of allegiance and thought are worthy of praise and if more of his neighbors were like him, I think many issues in the insular community would be mitigated.</p>
<p>Her shortlived marriage leaves many unanswered questions. I would have liked more details. She says they fight. About what? The book doesn&#8217;t elaborate. She talks about their neighbors in Airmont. I am from Monsey, I know those people. I would have liked more about that period of her life. The life of what has become known as a &#8220;Tuna Beigel&#8221;. They dress somewhat chasidic but are much more liberated. Why didn&#8217;t that lifestyle work for Deborah? These are areas of the book that feel rushed and unfinished.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the book was the twist of fate that began with a visit to a Kabbalist. He told Deborah that her number was &#8220;nine&#8221;. On 9/9/9 just after midnight, Deborah had a life-changing motor vehicle accident. She says that the Kabbalist was right. Her number was nine. Somehow, I don&#8217;t think that is what the Kabbalist had in mind. But it&#8217;s poetic justice that his words were used by Deborah to rationalize her departure from the community.</p>
<p>The overall &#8220;lesson&#8221; of the book, if there is one, is that her whole life, as a good Chasidic girl, Deborah was taught to trust her intellect over her impulse. She was supposed to use her knowledge of Jewish law and thought to guide her and not allow her emotions and passions. Her freedom came when she put her impulse ahead of her intellect. Judaism is really all about placing one&#8217;s intellect above their impulse. Everyone from Maimonides to Luzzato talks about this. The trick is to channel one&#8217;s impulse into positive, creative, useful activity. One is not required to suppress everything about one&#8217;s self. Rather, one is supposed to use the intellect to guide one&#8217;s passions and creativity. The goal is to use one&#8217;s personality to improve the world.</p>
<p>More balanced, moderate forms of orthodox Judaism provide a better framework for avoiding this damaging problem. Most careers and opportunities are available to orthodox Jews. There are a few exceptions. Perhaps it would be useful for the more moderate versions of orthodox Judaism to focus on this aspect of Judaism. Even better, if the more insular versions of orthodox Judaism like the chasidic sects mentioned in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> or the new insular communities in the non-chasidic world would allow these doors to be opened for their communities.</p>
<p>There is somewhat of a happy ending to the book, even for religious, orthodox Jews. Feldman says that she is still proud to be a Jew. In a different sense than before, but still, she is not a &#8220;self hating Jew&#8221; as some have claimed. This is a positive development in light of her difficulties with her community,</p>
<p>To close, allow me to address what has become the biggest controversy over this book: The murder cover-up.</p>
<p>Feldman tells the story of her brother-in-law calling their home and telling them that a heinous murder had just occurred in Kiryas Joel. He was personally there as a Hatzalah member and he claimed that there was a cover-up of the murder.</p>
<p>In the book, the story is told as a rumor. The book makes no claim as to whether or not there was a murder. The only claim being made is that this is what she was told. The point of the story is to illustrate that no one would have a hard time believing that a murder was covered up. As a reader, I am deeply troubled that a rumor like this is even possible. But I did not ever think that Feldman was reporting on something with facts to back it up. This was a record of a conversation that she recalled. The issues that remain are not whether or not there was a murder. It is a much more basic issue. Whether or not a murder could or would be covered up. I don&#8217;t think anyone would find this impossible, what with all the cover-ups of sex abuse, domestic abuse, fraud and corruption. That is the real issue. Whether or not she should have investigated and looked at police reports is irrelevant in my opinion. I don&#8217;t think Feldman thought that including this anecdote in the book would be as scandalous as it has become. I would have preferred if the she had made it clearer that the episode was rumor. But that is how I took it.</p>
<p>In my opinion, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a> is a good book. Some are calling it a chillul Hashem. I find this ironic. Here is a woman who left the community. She tells her story. The story seems entirely plausible. But because she left it is chillul Hashem. Yet, when people who stay in the community commit crimes, acts of violence, are unseemly for other reasons, that is not a chillul Hashem. Quite the double standard if you ask me. All communities have what I call &#8220;abhorrent beliefs&#8221;. Is it a chillul Hashem when our abhorrent beliefs or practices are exposed truthfully? That&#8217;s a hard question to answer.  More important is the challenge of dealing with them in a modern world. This will be addressed in a future post. Maybe even tomorrow.<em> (Update: Posted &#8211; <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/21/what-to-do-about-abhorrent-beliefs-in-religions/">What to Do About Abhorrent Beliefs in Religions?</a>).</em></p>
<p>Should you read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439187002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439187002">Unorthodox</a>? It&#8217;s interesting enough. Deborah&#8217;s story is unique enough to hold your interest. The inside information about the insular communities of Williamsburg and beyond is worth your time. If you are looking for high drama and massive scandals look elsewhere. It&#8217;s &#8220;good reading&#8221;. Not &#8220;can&#8217;t miss reading&#8221;.</p>

I enjoy his books, and other writings very much. One book that I particularly enjoyed was the provocatively titled: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a></p>
<p>The book is not really about what the title implies. Instead, the book is an analysis of required beliefs in Judaism. It is an excellent book and a joy to read. I heartily recommend the book to anyone interested in the evolution of fundamental beliefs in Judaism.</p>
<p>One important issue that is thoroughly discussed is the importance the Sages of the Mishna and Talmud placed on actions while placing less importance on faith or beliefs. This is true. But the significance of this fact is debatable. That is because faith or belief in a deity was a basic assumption of life in the era in which the Sages lived. One had to be insane to be an atheist 2000 years ago. How would one even begin to explain the world in which they lived. However, today one can certainly be sane and deny the existence of God. In fact, some might argue that the tables have turned and belief in God is the less sane position. After all, there is no scientific proof of an all-knowing, all-powerful Creator. So, while I enjoyed the discussion in the book about actions having more meaning than beliefs in the eyes of the Sages, how well that transfers to modern times is another discussion entirely.</p>
<p>Another core point of the book is that in adopting the 13 Fundamental Beliefs of Maimonides there is an odd irony.<span id="more-5099"></span> On the one hand, Maimonides the Rationalist lost. By this I mean that Judaism today is mostly not the Judaism of Maimonides. Today&#8217;s Judaism is dominated by metaphysics, mysticism, and Zohar-centric Kabbalah. The Judaism of Maimonides functioned without  these elements. (For a thorough analysis and discussion of this point see Kellner&#8217;s book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906764158">Maimonides&#8217; Confrontation with Mysticism</a>.) So Maimonides lost. He tried to establish a Judaism free from these non-essential elements but he failed. The public rejected his approach.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the public embraced the revolutionary suggestion of Maimonides that there are 13 fundamental beliefs and what those beliefs actually entail. There were other fundamental belief systems proposed by others and Judaism may have got along just fine without a formal expression of fundamental beliefs.</p>
<p>Yet, here we are today. The public has rejected rationalism and embraced fundamental beliefs. Isn&#8217;t it ironic?</p>
<p>The final part of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a> is a polemic. Kellner argues that it should be okay to relegate the 13 Fundamental Beliefs for the sake of Jewish Unity. His proposal is based on the assumption that Orthodox Jewish rabbis and non-rabbis avoid working with non-orthodox rabbis and non-rabbis. There is no conversation or joint agenda in which orthodox and non-orthodox Jews  participate. Further, Kellner assumes that this plain fact is because of the halachic prohibition that proscribes a believer from engaging with a heretic. The logic follows that since by the lights of the 13 Fundamental Principles there is a presumption that non-orthodox Jews are technically heretics. Hence, it is forbidden to engage them. This, according to Kellner is the reason there is no communication between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews. Kellner then argues that for the sake of unity, continuity, and peace we should discard with a highly literal usage of Maimonides fundamental beliefs and open the lines of communication with non-orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>One might suspect that I would agree with Kellner on this matter. In principle I do. I wrote about it here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/21/there-is-no-tent/">There is No Tent</a>. I think we should increase communication and interaction with all Jews. But I don&#8217;t agree with Kellner&#8217;s logic here. Not at all.</p>
<p>The reason there is little interaction between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews has very little to do with halacha. It has a lot to do with social concerns. The orthodox establishment is more concerned with their children and keeping their children orthodox than the nitty-gritty of whether or not it is permissible to engage with the non-orthodox. In other words, the real reason there is little interaction between the groups is because the orthodox are concerned about the influence that non-orthodox will have over their children or even themselves. It is a matter of insulation and isolation, not a matter of halacha.</p>
<p>And so, it makes little difference to the orthodox Jew that fundamentals of faith are a novel introduction by Maimonides or that there are other codes of faith that could be acceptable. What does matter is that access to a world of Judaism that does not follow the chain of halacha that is followed by orthodox Jews could &#8220;corrupt&#8221; orthodox Jews and they may jump ship. It is merely circling the wagons. It is not a halachic decision.</p>
<p>Therefore, Kellner&#8217;s ambitious and admirable suggestion is a non-starter. Unless the orthodox Jewish community can foster a confidence in its principles and ideals to the point that interaction is not considered a spiritual danger, I don&#8217;t foresee a change in approach. As a pure academic exercise, the recommendation of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a> is bold and exciting to me. But in a practical sense, it is lacking.</p>
<p>The only way intra-Jewish relations will change significantly is if our leadership suggests that it has value and that value trumps overzealous concerns over assimilation. I hope it does change.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a> and thinking about its many fascinating points for discussion. If you have read it let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

I saw it just after I wrote about the modern day exorcist here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/10/28/demons-dybbuks-devils-and-exorcism/" target="_blank">Demons, Dybbuks, Devils and Exorcism</a>. Buying this book was a smart decision. I read the book a little while back and neglected to do a review but I&#8217;ve wanted to tell you all about this book since I read it.</p>
<p>The author, J.H Chajes, is a professor at University of Haifa. He is a distant relative of the great Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Chajes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> is very scholarly and well researched. Yet, it reads like a novel, well almost like a novel, and it kept me engrossed in its content from start to finish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> chronicles the rise of recorded incidents of dybbuks and exorcism in the era of mystical writings of the Arizal&#8217;s students. Most of the book takes place in the 16th and 17th centuries. The book traces the relationship between Christian, Muslim and Jewish exorcism legends and practice as well. An appendix has full accounts of exorcisms found in rabbinic literature from that era.</p>
<p>As a skeptic, I found the restraint of Chajes astounding. It is almost as if he is winking the entire time that he is writing about demonic / disembodied soul possession. You just know that he can&#8217;t believe what he is writing as fact is even possible. But he writes as an objective 3rd party about rabbis and others performing exorcisms with a straight face.</p>
<p>There are a few points that I took away from the book that are worth sharing.<span id="more-4968"></span> First of all, the book mentions some disputes between rabbis. They were vicious disagreements. Accusations of philandering, abject immorality and horrible insults are hurled the way of one particular rabbi. I can only imagine what our rabbinic disputes will look like to historians some time in the future. Fascinating to read and fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>Second, the book supports the theory that &#8220;the more knowledge becomes accessible, the more some religious leaders will try to &#8216;esotericize&#8217; their religion to maintain a level of separation between the masses and the public&#8221;. I know, that theory is a mouthful. With regard to exorcism it works as follows. The masses were becoming more literate throughout the world. Exorcism was an art reserved for spiritual leaders and scholars. It was not available to the masses no matter how learned they became. Thus, the existence of demons and dybbuks reinforced the need for leadership. It is similar to today&#8217;s maximalist position of Daas Torah. In a time that more orthodox Jews can study the sources and responsa on a given subject, the religious leaders have reserved a segment of inaccessible knowledge under the maximalist position of Daas Torah. I&#8217;m not saying this is wrong or intentional, rather it is a pattern and it happens.</p>
<p>My third point for this review is the nature of the relationship between Jewish scholars and their Christian and Muslim counterparts. It seems that there was much interaction between them and they worked together, at least for the sake of exorcism. It was nice to see cooperation instead of the stereotypical debates and polemics against one another. If they could do it, so could we.</p>
<p>If you have ANY interest in dybbuks or demons or exorcism or 16th century mysticism, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a>.</p>

I hope to share some of them with you over the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most compelling book I read was hot off the presses: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936235374/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1936235374">Strictly Kosher Reading</a> by Yoel Finkelman. Briefly, the purpose of the book is to present an academic study of the fiction and non-fiction reading that is published within the charedi community. Analyzing books for children, adults, women, religions and secular audiences gives the scholar access to the framework of charedi Judaism.</p>
<p>The book posits that charedi Judaism is a conscious effort to recreate a Utopian version of Eastern European orthodox Judaism. The book disputes that this society ever truly existed in the way it is imagined and recreated today and calls this version of history unhistorical and a myth. But the point of the book is not to prove or disprove whether or not this is a myth or fact. Rather, the book tries to prove that there a Herculean effort to establish that myth/fact as the reality in 21st century America.</p>
<p>The book only analyzes the charedi community and uses a specific (and very accurate) definition of the charedi community. It is a non-chasidic, &#8220;yeshivish&#8221; community that does not completely shun the outside world. Charedi communities are not absolutely insular. They teach secular subjects, many obtain secular jobs, English is the primary language, yet there is a conscious effort to reject much of secular culture. Whether it is culture, science, diversity or other contemporary values in secular society, these are all rejected.</p>
<p>This creates a very interesting phenomena.<span id="more-4728"></span> The charedi community is situated inside the secular, &#8220;outside&#8221; world but ultimately rejects much of it. This balance is what creates much of the tension in the book and in the charedi world. Ideas are only acceptable if they are found in Torah, secular recreation is frowned upon, yet, and this is the key, ideas not found in Torah have crept into charedi Judaism, secular recreation (fiction books, sports, movies etc) have found their way into the charedi community.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936235374/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1936235374">Strictly Kosher Reading</a> analyzes this phenomena and does so excellently.</p>
<p>I read a lot as a teenager and read a lot of the books that Finkelman uses in his analysis. At times, I found myself agreeing wholeheartedly with his findings. Particularly with regard to books that claim to teach the &#8220;Torah approach to X (parenting, depression, divorce, whatever)&#8221; but really are just regurgitated ideas from popular science, psychology, pop-parenting, etc.) that are repackaged with Torah lingo and jargon is this most egregious. Further, trying to codify any specific parenting, family, psychology advice as Torah advice is at best disingenuous because of the myriad sources that disagree, contradict or talk above one another. Also, it is clear that many of these sources are products of their times and the vicissitudes of the environments in which they were written.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936235374/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1936235374">Strictly Kosher Reading</a> for any curious reader.</p>
<p>I do have two criticisms of the book. One in style and one is substance.</p>
<p>The style critique is that the book seems to jump around a lot. There are times where I was reading and wondering how what I was reading was related to the paragraph I had just completed. Things seem disjointed at times and there is no clear order to the book. Also, similarly, the author is constantly telling the reader &#8220;what he is going to do&#8221; and when he is going to do it. It was a bit distracting. I do not revoke my recommendation based on this I just wish it were easier to read.</p>
<p>The substance critique is a bit more serious.</p>
<p>Throughout the book various rabbis, gedolim and Roshei Yeshiva are mentioned. Mostly because there are books written about them and they provide more data to support the book&#8217;s arguments. Three specific gedolim are mentioned and I feel strongly that mentioning them in the context of this book is disingenuous.</p>
<p>The three are: R&#8217; Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz, R&#8217; Shimon Schwab and R&#8217; Yaakov Weinberg. I admit, I have a bias towards these three great men. They are three of my personal heroes.</p>
<p>Finkelman tries to prove that the American yeshiva is a facsimile of an Eastern European yeshiva that never really existed. One of his &#8220;proofs&#8221; is a famous idea from R&#8217; Shraga Feivel who is credited with inventing the modern day charedi yeshiva / day school. In his view, R&#8217; Shraga Feivel was saying that the goal of the American yeshiva is to follow the model of the Eastern European yeshiva. The thing is that R&#8217; Shraga Feivel&#8217;s model was specifically a drastic departure from the prior Eastern European model. The same quote Finkelman uses to prove his point is actually a disproof! R&#8217; Shraga Feivel&#8217;s theory of education is quoted as follows:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Reb Shraga Feivel sel-consciously set out to create a new type of </em>bochur<em> in the melting pot of America, one who would&#8230; draw from all that was best of the many strands of European Jewish life. America&#8230; would produce a new Jew combining within himself the best elements of Europe: the Lithuanian intellectual acuity, the </em>bren<em> (warmth) of </em>Chasidus<em>, the organizational abilities of German Jewry, and the appreciation of </em>hiddur mitzvah<em> (beautification of the mitzvah) of the Hungarians. Above all, the American Jew would be characterized by his </em>temimus<em> (sincerity), a trait that was much more a part of American culture than of Europe.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>My grandfather was a talmid muvhak of R&#8217; Shraga Feivel and is mentioned several times in the book. He is also credited with facilitating the book&#8217;s publication in the acknowledgments. I probably heard this idea from my grandfather several dozen times. This <em>was</em> R&#8217; Shraga Feivel. It was his essence and the essence of the yeshiva system he envisioned for America.</p>
<p>The entire point R&#8217; Shraga Feivel was making was that America <em>is </em>different and requires a more well rounded yeshiva student. He is quoted in the same Artscroll book as saying that yeshivas in America needed to produce &#8220;soldiers&#8221; and not &#8220;generals&#8221;. This in itself was a huge modification to the yeshiva system as it was in Eastern Europe where the goal was to produce Torah giants and not be as concerned with the general public.</p>
<p>Therefore, I find it disingenuous to use R&#8217; Shraga Feivel&#8217;s words to make the point that American yeshivos recreated the Eastern European version when he was in fact saying and doing the very opposite.</p>
<p>The book uses a famous quote from R&#8217; Shimon Schwab to support the idea that charedi Judaism specifically creates a sanitized version of history that supports the charedi view of history. His words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What ethical purpose is served by preserving a realistic historic picture? Nothing but the satisfaction of curiosity. We should tell ourselves and our children the good memories of the good people, their unshakable faith, their staunch defense of tradition, their life of truth, their impeccable honesty, their boundless charity and their great reverence for Torah and Torah sages. What is gained by pointing out their inadequacies and their contradictions? We want to be inspired by their example and learn from their experience&#8230;</em></p>
<p>On the surface this quote plays right into Finkelman&#8217;s thesis. I believe that R&#8217; Schwab meant something slightly different. He meant that the focus of studying history for frum Jews is not for historical accuracy. It is for inspiration. It is not a science. It is literature. Meanwhile he clearly acknowledges that the charedi view of the past is skewed. But he says that&#8217;s okay as long as one realizes the difference between inspirational myth and history. I don&#8217;t believe R&#8217; Schwab meant that we should purposefully ignore or rewrite history. Rather that if the goal is to inspire (and usually it is in charedi schools) then it should not be taught as history or claim accuracy, rather it is inspiration.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Yaakov Weinberg is quoted in the book as well. The context is not important at all. What is important is that if anyone with gadol credentials would agree with Yoel Finkelman it would be R&#8217; Yaakov Weinberg. His learning was classically rationalist in many respects, his yeshiva approved of college and secular education and his students are more acculturated than the students of almost any other yeshiva to the right of Yeshiva University. He was maligned for his &#8220;left wing&#8221; views and fought for moderation in the charedi community. It seems silly to toss R&#8217; Weinberg&#8217;s name into a conversation about charedi censorship and rewriting of history and casting him as part of the process. He certainly did more to slow that process down than any other ostensibly charedi gadol.</p>
<p>My <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/rabbi-aaron-fink/" target="_blank">father</a> is a talmid muvhak of R&#8217; Weinberg. I met R&#8217; Weinberg several times myself. I grew up hearing his insights and opinions on a daily basis. That he could be lumped in with the most narrow version of charedi Judaism is absurd by all accounts.</p>
<p>Similarly, I think R&#8217; Shraga Feivel and R&#8217; Schwab would more likely be allies of Yoel Finkelman on many matters in this book. If he felt it was necessary to include them in his study and place them on the side of the fence that is criticized in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936235374/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1936235374">Strictly Kosher Reading</a> I wish there would have at least a footnote at the mention of the names of these three gedolim indicating their general stance as being more sympathetic to the author&#8217;s than the current charedi establishment.</p>
<p>There is much more wonderful, insightful, fascinating and constructive material in the book. I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants an academic lens into charedi culture. Whether you know nothing about the charedi community, are in the charedi world now, were in the charedi world at one time, or plan on being in the charedi world sometime in the future, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936235374/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1936235374">Strictly Kosher Reading</a> is a great read.</p>

This is not a normal book review. It is really a more of a reflection upon reading a wonderful book.</p>
<p>A friend suggested I read <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345377060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0345377060">The Search for God at Harvard</a> and gave me a copy of the book a little while ago. I finally got around to reading <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345377060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0345377060">The Search for God at Harvard</a> and really enjoyed it. There are some very important thing that I learned from the book and I recommend reading it if you have not yet read it yourself.</p>
<p><a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345377060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0345377060">The Search for God at Harvard</a> is supposed to be the story of New York Times journalist, Ari Goldman&#8217;s year at Harvard Divinity School. While much of the book focuses on his year there, the book is really about some of Goldman&#8217;s issues with religion, issues with his parents and his rise in through the ranks at the NY Times. In other words, the backdrop for the book is Goldman&#8217;s year at the Div School, but the bulk of the storytelling in the book has nothing to do with what he learned there. I would have liked more.</p>
<p>But that is my only criticism of the book; wanting more can hardly be a criticism.</p>
<p>Ari Goldman was raised as an orthodox Jew in the 60&#8217;s. As Goldman notices, much has changed in the orthodox Jewish community in the last 50 years. Goldman remains committed to orthodox Judaism, but like everyone, is not perfect. He takes some liberties with his observance. This is an attitude that has mostly been purged from orthodox Judaism. Many people think this is a good thing. I do not. Goldman&#8217;s story is a prime illustration why.<span id="more-4370"></span></p>
<p>I cried two times while reading <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345377060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0345377060">The Search for God at Harvard</a>.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t help but notice that Goldman feels cheated by his parents who divorced when he was 5 years old. He makes it clear that he still feels the pain of that 5 year old who lost his beloved friday night Shabbos dinners with his parents. So when he has a moment where he connects with his son and realizes how lucky he is to be a father it seems to give him a bit solace. You can feel him healing. The writing is that good and the point is so poignant that I could not help but to tear up. But this was a sidebar to the book. I think the second time I cried shows how the social changes in orthodox Judaism over the last 50 years may not be for the best.</p>
<p>The biggest tear-jerker for me was at the end of the book. Goldman struggles to remain observant throughout the book. He struggles as single male in the big city. He struggles as a journalist who may need to work on Shabbos. He even feels Divine Intervention when his first real journalism gig at the NY Times does not require he work on Shabbos. He feels connected to orthodox Judaism. It is his Judaism.</p>
<p>After the year at the Div School, Goldman and his wife and son move to Westchester County. They join a modern orthodox synagogue. The rabbi hears that Goldman has quite a talent as a cantor and asks him if he would lead one of the services on the high holidays. At first Goldman is honored but he declines. Eventually he acquiesces to pressure to take the job. He feels validation that he has been able to navigate the difficulties of balancing modernity with an ancient tradition. But some members of the shul are not happy. They find some of his activities are not in consonance with Jewish law. They said he worked on Shabbos, he ate (kosher food) in non-Kosher restaurants, he read the New Testament, his son was named for a non-Jew etc. In Goldman&#8217;s mind, these were struggles. Sometimes he won, sometimes he lost. In Goldman&#8217;s eyes these were battles. To his coreligionists they were seen as compromises. And they threatened the sheltered world of orthodox Judaism. That year, Goldman did not lead the services. In fact he did not even go to the synagogue because he was so hurt.</p>
<p>That was when I cried.</p>
<p>The postscript to the high holidays story was that the other synagogue members eventually apologized. They told Goldman that they too participate in many of this &#8220;objectionable&#8221; activities. But they keep them quiet. They don&#8217;t discuss them. If had kept his mouth shut he would have been just fine.</p>
<p>Goldman concludes his book with what I feel to be the most significant point in <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345377060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0345377060">The Search for God at Harvard</a>. After the ethnic pride movements of the 70&#8217;s, religions began to shift to more fundamentalist views in the 80&#8217;s. This continued through the 90&#8217;s and brings us to where we are today. Intolerance for co-coreligionists and &#8220;other-religionists&#8221; became more pronounced in the 80&#8217;s than it was prior to the 80&#8217;s. President Reagan brought religion to fore of policy and discourse in America.</p>
<p>In orthodox Judaism a similar phenomena happened as well. Orthodox Judaism became more narrow. Many activities, positions, policies, beliefs, modes of dress, aspirations among other things that were previously accepted in the broad spectrum of orthodox Judaism were expunged. People and communities were told to move to the right, or move on. It has not let up since. In matters of theology, practice, social and religious, the orthodox Judaism of my grandparents is long gone.</p>
<p>Am I crazy for trying to bring it back? Maybe. But that won&#8217;t stop me from trying.</p>

I went on Amazon and looked for the best looking book I could find on the Cairo Geniza and I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805242589/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0805242589" target="_blank">Sacred Trash: The Lost and Found World of the Cairo Geniza</a>. It was amazing.</p>
<p>First, some background. As we recently studied in the Rambam Class, there is a prohibition against the detsruction of God&#8217;s printed name. So what do you do when the names are printed in books or on papers if they are no longer able to be used? Geniza. They are buried and given the same respect given to humans after humans die.</p>
<p>Generally, a geniza will be buried and the paper will decompose and be lost forever. The Cairo Geniza is a collection of items that fell into disuse. But the Cairo Geniza has two incredible anomolies that make it so special. First of all, the residents of Cairo and the contributors to this geniza buried all items with hebrew letters. They buried contracts and poems as well as prayers and biblical texts. This makes the content of the geniza much broader. More importantly, because of the climate and the fact that the geniza was in a closet sized room and not buried underground, many of the items placed in the geniza remained intact.</p>
<p>The Cairo Geniza was a repository of nearly 300,000 Jewish documents and holy texts spanning 1000 years. The earliest documents were from the 9th century and the latest documents were from the 19th century. That is a mind-blowing discovery. Further, as opposed to the Dead Sea Scrolls, the people of Cairo were not a minor sect. They practiced rabbinic Judaism similar to orthodox Judaism of today. The traditions and teachings of orthodox Judaism that are practiced and taught today can be traced through the Geniza and were practiced and taught in a way that is familiar to orthodox Jews today.<span id="more-4241"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805242589/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0805242589" target="_blank">Sacred Trash</a> is best known for its wonderful way of weaving together the men and women who discovered the geniza, their motivations and personalities with their discoveries. It reads more like a novel than a book of Academia and I am sure that history buffs and budding scholars will find the book a bit watered down. No matter. It was perfect for me.</p>
<p>Reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805242589/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0805242589"></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805242589/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0805242589" target="_blank">Sacred Trash</a> I learned a lot about Solomon Schechter. Today, his name is associated with Conservative Judaism. But when he was chasing the Cairo Geniza, he sounded very different from what I expected. His writings and his passions for strict observance of Judaism is more familiar in Orthodox Judaism than Conservative Judaism today. It seemed to me from the excerpts in the book that were taken from his writings that he would be more comfortable in a Yeshiva today than at the JTS. It could be the book has mislead me, but that is what I gleaned from the book about Solomon Schechter.</p>
<p>I also learned that rough drafts of the Mishnah Torah were found in the geniza. Oh how I would love to see those&#8230;</p>
<p>My main interest in the book was to get a sense of daily religious life for observant Jews 1000 years ago. It wasn&#8217;t easy to pull these details out of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805242589/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0805242589"></a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805242589/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0805242589" target="_blank">Sacred Trash</a> as that was not its purpose. But the few things that I learned in this regard were very profound and have affected or affirmed the way I see Judaism.</p>
<p>In the earliest recorded days of the Jewish community in Cairo, there were three synagogues. One was for Jews who followed the tradition of the Babylonian Talmud. That would be most similar to today&#8217;s orthodox Jews. The second was for those followed the Palestinian Talmud (Talmud Yerushalmi). The third was for Karaites. They did not follow the Talmud at all. Although their disagreements on theology were intense. There is evidence that they married out of their respective sects and &#8220;intermarried&#8221;. They made stipulations about observance in the marriage contracts resolving to place their affection for one another above disagreements on observance. They disagreed on theology but all realized that they were striving for the same truth. This created an environment of inclusion rather than exclusion.</p>
<p>To me, this is an important lesson. I am not certain if the lesson is applicable today or not. But I am sure that I wish it was. Healthy competition among Jewish sects is a good thing. But hatred, negative propaganda and absolute dismissal of entire swaths of Judaism cannot be the ideal. But more importantly, it wasn&#8217;t always this way. It doesn&#8217;t always have to be this way either.</p>
<p>The other thing that caught my eye in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805242589/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0805242589" target="_blank">Sacred Trash</a> was the focus on liturgy and in particular piyitum of the Jews in the early years of the Cairo Geniza. Piyutim (liturgical poems) were the focus of Jewish life in those days. People who could not read hebrew or pray came to the synagogue to hear the newest piyutim. Each week a new piyut was written in masterful style and substance. It is something that is lost upon us moderns but to them it was the ultimate expression of devotion and connection to God. It&#8217;s interesting for a number of reasons. The first thing I thought about was the comparison to the secular world. Entertainment in those days were ballads. People paid money to hear a good ballad. Jews came to the synagogue to hear beautiful ballads about God, the Jews and Torah.</p>
<p>In my view, this illustrates the amorphous nature of social Jewish observance. During the era of the Temple, the focus of Jewish social observance was the holy Temple service. Following the destruction of the Temple the focus became redacting, editing and perfecting Jewish texts like the Torah and the Talmud. It seems that in the 9th through 12th centuries piyutim were the focus. During medieval times, the focus for many was simply survival for others it was the three methods of commentary on the Talmud, pirush, psak and pircha. After the Renaissance the focus shifted to scholarly Talmudic discourses called pilpul. Some felt this was too intellectual and robbed many of a connection with God and Chassidus was born. In the last century, the focus has shifted to a life of kollel, where men study Torah full time after marriage and are supported by their communities (or wives). Also we have seen the rise of the Daf Yomi (daily study of one folio of Talmud) and perhaps most of all we have seen the proliferation of chumros (stringencies) and segulos (charms). I wonder, how will we be defined in a few hundred years?</p>
<p>Of course, these are generalizations. And also, we are presuming adherence to mitzvos and participation in the synagogue as a given throughout these eras of observant Jews. But the point remains. The focus of social Jewish observance changes, has changed many times and continues to change. It is important for our generation to know that we are unique, things are different today than they have ever been and the social acceptability of kollel life is not a given. Many would say, perhaps it should be reexamined.</p>

<p>While browsing the local Barnes and Noble, I made a stop at the perilously thin Judaism section. There are a couple shelves of mostly uninteresting books. Only one book caught my eye. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen: The Hidden Lives of Hasidic Rebels</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0807036277&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. I vaguely recall hearing about this book a while back. (As in years ago, But I never read it.)</p>
<p>Now I have a renewed interest in the lives of those who live in a community that they are not comfortable in since my <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/04/13/thoughts-on-ami-magazines-orthoprax-article-the-impostors-among-us/">Thoughts on Ami Magazine’s Orthoprax Article: The Impostors Among Us</a> blog post. So I purchased the book at Barnes and Noble, something I rarely do, and read the book after the meal on the 7th night of Pesach.</p>
<p>The book is really a dissertation by the author who intended to study hasidic Jews in Williamsburg for her Ph.D. By accident, she began a study of those who left or were in the process of leaving hasidic Judaism. For this I am thankful, because it was way more interesting than the former.<span id="more-4194"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> had me almost right away when it distinguished between Lubavitch / Chabad and all other chasidic groups. This is something that I have discussed with friends online and in real life that was very well stated in the book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>With its &#8220;mitzvah tanks&#8221;, campus Chabad houses, celebrity stuffed fundraising telethons, and outposts across the globe, Lubavitch has become almost synonymous with Hasidism. This despite the fact that in the United State it numbers less than half the size of Satmar and is hardly representative of the Hasidic community as a whole. With their mission &#8211; unique in the Hasidic world &#8211; to attract unaffiliated Jews, Lubavitchers are raised to engage (Jewish) outsiders, doing missionary work wherever Jews are found around the world. [&#8230;]</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This emphasis on proselytizing has meant that a significant percentage of Lubavitchers were not born in the community but joined by choice. Often those who join [&#8230;] have led formerly secular lives, which likely included a college education or beyond. [&#8230;] Additionally, Lubavitch raises a substantial amount of money from non-Hasidic Jews [&#8230;]. All of this is strong contrast to the other Hasidic sects, which include Satmar, Ger, Viznitz, Belz, Bobov, Skver, Sponka, Pupa and Breslow, to name only a few. In these sects, almost all members are born into the community, and none engages in formal outreach, making them comparatively more insulated from , and less aware of, the ways of the outside society than their counterparts in Lubavitch.</em></p>
<p>This is a very important distinction and I quote the book here because it is an important point about Lubavitch and a more important point about Chasidic Judaism in general. They are isolated. Almost completely.</p>
<p>What happens when someone who was isolated wants to rejoin society at large? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> tells that story. Short version: It is very hard, sometimes humorous and always painful.</p>
<p>The book is similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> (reviewed here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/23/book-review-hush/">Book Review | Hush</a>) in that it does a decent job describing the immense social pressure placed upon members of the Chasidic community. So much of their approach to dealing with issues is by worrying what the neighbors will say and less about what might have caused the issues or even thinking about solutions to the issues.</p>
<p>Another very eye opening element of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> is the interests of those who &#8220;leave&#8221;. The writer of the Ami article assumed it was because of mental illness. Others say it is because they want to commit sins. But the truth is obviously more comples. The subjects in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> had a varitey of interests. Some of the interests were purely intellectual. But they could not satisfy their intellectual interests within their community. They wanted to read literetature or even just Jewish philosiphy from non-Orthodox rabbis. These were forbidden. For this reason many of them began to venture off into the libraries of New York. It seems that the Jewish Theoligical Seminary library, with its vast collection of Jewish books, is a frequent haunt of these rebels. Hardly the places of debauchery and hedonism some are wont to believe draws people away from tradition.</p>
<p>I also found that the confusion between what is mitzvah, halacha, minhag and social convention really hurt these rebels. They were taught that a streimel or chasidic dress in general was on the same level as keeping Shabbos or kosher. Obviously this is not true and wrong. But because they were taught this, it made it that much easier to leave mitzvah observance after shaving a beard.</p>
<p>Something else in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> that was interesting was the revered rabbi who became an orthodox Jewish feminist and left the chasidic community because of their approach to women. He kind of reminded me of a less atheistic version of the orthoprax rabbi (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/01/the-orthoprax-rabbi-takes-the-j-blogosphere-by-storm/">The Orthoprax Rabbi Takes the J-Blogosphere By Storm</a>) and I was pleased to see that he was able to (kind of) leave the Chasidic world but find a comfortable place in the non-chasidic orthodox community.</p>
<p>Of course the Internet played a large role in these people finding each other, finding comfort and finding their new lives. The Internet cannot be blamed, but it was a part of the process.</p>
<p>The thing that left the greatest impact on me was the insight of one woman who left the chasidic world and to placate her family and her daughter&#8217;s father sends her daughter to a modern orthodox Jewish school. She herself is not observant but leaves room for the possibility that she could become more observant after she heals (she was sexually abused) and can reconnect with her Judaism. She expects her daughter to be observant and raises her in that kind of home. She remarked that she would always try to discipline her child to be a good person and keep the rules of Judaism. She tries to make it fun and not about fear. That is a great. But what struck me is that she said that while she might, from time to time, yell at her daughter about other things, she would never yell at her daughter about anything having to do with religion. For her it has to be about love and happiness. Not fear and yelling. At the very least, it is something worth thinking about.</p>
<p>Overall <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807036277/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0807036277">Unchosen</a> is an amazing book. It offers insight that people of all walks of life can and should learn from. I am very happy that I read it and I recommend that adults read this book.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there are many lessons in the book that can help keep as many  as possible, &#8220;chosen&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>There will be one more future post about this book forthcoming.</em></p>

I recommend Rabbi David Fohrman’s<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983269017/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0983269017" target="_blank"> The Queen You Thought You Knew</a>. If you order it today, you can get it before Shabbos and read the book before Purim. It is an easy read and the book is not too long.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983269017/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0983269017" target="_blank">The Queen You Thought You Knew</a> is worthwhile addition to your library. Rabbi Fohrman discusses a novel approach to the Purim story. His work is mostly speculative but presented reasonably and in my opinion, responsibly.</p>
<p>The premise of the book is that there are many many questions that remain unanswered in the Megilla which can be answered with the novel approach of Rabbi Forhman. Many of the questions in the book have been asked and answered by Chazal or more recent rabbis. But I am not aware of any holistic solution to some of the more well known and lesser known challenges within the Megilla narrative.<span id="more-3915"></span></p>
<p>Rabbi Forhman takes us on a journey of question, thought and theory to find answers and ultimately his novel approach.</p>
<p>I won’t ruin the book in this post but I will say that it is nothing like anything you have heard before. The book is clearly well researched and well thought out.</p>
<p>Although I wholeheartedly recommend this book. But there is one small caveat. It is important to note that Rabbi Fohrman’s theory is almost completely unsubstantiated in Chazal or other classical sources. It is almost entirely novel and based purely on the text of the Megilla. Rabbi Fohrman himself seems to forewarn of this throughout the book by hedging the theory of the book as speculative and a possibility not to the exclusion of any other idea. To some, this may be a great accomplishment. To others it may be controversial. I think it is a worthwhile read if only for the questions presented and the very novel solution as tenuous as it may be.</p>
<p>While using an academic style of study, the book fails to use any external corroborative materials to support its flimsy premise. In fact, I think the historical record would indicate that the premise is wrong. In my mind, if you&#8217;re going to use academic methodology, you should provide some scholarly support for your premise. This is the biggest and most glaring flaw of the book. Outside of this critique the book&#8217;s premise is elegant and useful.</p>
<p>It is also worthwhile to discuss the merits and demerits of the style of study the book represents. It is a departure from typical yeshiva style study in that it is more similar to academic text-based study. This is different than almost every other Torah book that is studied in the yeshiva milieu. It remains to be seen if this will become a more popular form of study or if it will be shunned by the yeshiva fraternity.</p>
<p>This last issue is being discussed in my post on DovBear: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/03/is-rabbi-fohrmans-purim-book.html">Is Rabbi Fohrman&#8217;s Purim Book Controversial?</a></p>

I don&#8217;t write about every book I read, but this one was worth sharing with you.</p>
<p>The book tells the story a white-Jewish woman Rachel Shilsky / Ruth McBride Jordan, who married two black men and raised a very successful family in the inner city. Alternating chapters, the book tells the story of her childhood from her perspective and the story of her adult life from her son, the author, James McBride&#8217;s perspective. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159448192X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=159448192X">The Color of Water</a> reads like a novel but is biographical.<span id="more-3702"></span></p>
<p>Rachel&#8217;s father was a rabbi in Virginia. According to his daughter, he was a really horrible person. He was violent, unloving and unfaithful to his crippled wife. He was cheap, racist and a hypocrite. Rachel&#8217;s experience with her father was her only Jewish experience and eventually led her to a life as far from Judaism as she could run. Reading about her limited understanding of her Judaism and her father&#8217;s gross behavior was depressing.</p>
<p>But despite it all, she persevered as a person. She left Judaism but she turned herself into a very strong woman. She led a large family against the odds to great success. Perhaps most importantly and ironically, her son attributes their success to her &#8220;Jewishness&#8221;. She pushed her children to get an education and stereotypically, many of them are &#8220;professionals&#8221; that would make any yiddishe mama proud.</p>
<p>As much as Rachel ran away from her Jewish roots, those Jewish values were nevertheless instilled in her family and led them to great success.</p>
<p>The book is fascinating, educational, heartwarming, heartrending and challenging. It is well written, fun to read, leaves room for much discussion, indeed, the book is part of many high school and college curricula and I recommend the book for teens and adults.</p>
<p>I would love to meet Mr. McBride and his mother after reading this book. I am pretty sure you will too.</p>

I paid for the book and received no compensation for this review. (Nor do I want any.)</em></p>
<p>Last week, my friend Heshy Fried told me about a new book called Hush. Curiosity piqued, I immediately purchased the book from Amazon. It was delivered to my door on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>After our Friday Night Dinner, I tucked my elder son into bed at 8:30 PM. I sat down with the book and began to read. Three hours later (and several tissues later) I completed the book. The best determination of a good read, is whether I can put the book down. I could not put down Hush. If you stop reading now, just buy the book and read it yourself. (You can buy the book by clicking on this link: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=PJFZ72NBQKBKWHAT" target="_blank">Hush</a>)<span id="more-3336"></span></p>
<p>Hush is a novel about an ancillary victim of sexual abuse in a chasidic community. But it&#8217;s not really a novel. The anonymous author writes that the story is based on her own story. Truthfully, the book is based on hundreds of stories and not just stories from the chasidic world. The same story, with a different backdrop can be told by many victims of abuse from almost any insular culture. This includes, inner-city communities, Catholics, Amish and Ultra-Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>The backdrop for this story is a fictional Chasidic sect in Borough Park. The fictional sect is in the style of the major Chassidic branches in the New York metropolitan area like Satmar, Ger, Vizhnitz and Skver.</p>
<p>The story is mostly told through the eyes of a nine year old girl. To me, this is the charm of the book.Victims of abuse say that their lives can become frozen at the age of the abuse. The nine year old perspective is so innocent on the one hand, so damaged on the other hand, so naive on yet another hand and disturbing on all hands.</p>
<p>There are plenty of villains in Hush, there are plenty of victims too. But only a few heros. This is how it is. Sexual abuse can ravage a community, but it takes a very strong person to be a hero in the face of abuse. Strong people like that are rare and the book demonstrates this sad reality wonderfully.</p>
<p>One of the heroes in Hush is a chasidic newspaper publisher. To me, he represents the bloggers who have done the dirty work of exposing this harm and its perpetrators. On behalf of everyone, thank you. The publisher in this book exposes abuse at his own peril. It shouldn&#8217;t be that way. The other hero in the book is the main character&#8217;s husband whose unconditional commitment to his wife gave her the strength to prevail under extremely trying circumstances. Enough so that she felt like an Eishes Chayil, a woman of valor, as the pseudonym implies.</p>
<p>Hush has a surprisingly light tone to most of the book. As it is seen through the eyes of a nine year old chasidic girl, the names and places in the book have cute and funny names that ring true to Orthodox Jews. I found myself laughing out loud many times throughout the book.</p>
<p>As to the &#8220;meat&#8221; of the plot. the community&#8217;s approach to allegations of sexual abuse are all too familiar. Insular communities all share a distrust of governmental authority and prefer to self-police. Unfortunately, there is no self-policing of abuse in the book.</p>
<p>Crying is to be expected as one reads Hush. There are moments of heartbreaking sadness and moments of emotional triumph. The book will move its reader to tears throughout the book and by the time the reader is at the climactic ending resistance to crying is futile.</p>
<p>Hush is important. It gives real life victims a voice they can relate to. The voice of the main characters of Hush are familiar to any victim of abuse. In this respect, the book is relevant to victims of abuse in any community.</p>
<p>I am only somewhat familiar, not intimately familiar with the idiosyncrasies and foibles of the chasidic community. But Hush does a spectacular job of drawing you into their community. I can only assume that what is written is accurate. (I would love if a chasidic reader would read Hush and get back to me about the accuracies of the depiction of the chasidic community in Hush.) The worldview portrayed in the book is absolutely terrifying. Anyone that is not exactly like &#8220;you&#8221; is an enemy or at best a heathen. The self absorption and ignorance about almost everything is shocking. Characters in Hush describe any custom they have as &#8220;The Torah say&#8221;, even when the Torah certainly does not say the thing they are quoting. Characters in Hush subscribe to every possible superstition Jewish culture has to offer. And perhaps worst of all, every kind of prejudice about &#8220;outsiders&#8221; that I am sure outsiders can sense in their real life interactions with the community. Characters in Hush have no working knowledge of what most communities call common sense and the facts of life.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, I wonder if these characteristics of the chasidic community, real or imagined for the book, contributed the trauma of sex abuse. Is abuse so horrible that the milieu plays a negligible role? Or perhaps is the abuse exacerbated when you have been trained to think that your community is vastly superior to others in every possible way, that God prefers you over anyone else and misinformation is so prevalent that one has to wonder if it is a vast ignorance conspiracy to maintain allegiance?</p>
<p>It is a question that may not have an answer but I think it is the broader question that is raised in Hush.</p>
<p>I cannot possible give a bigger endorsement for Hush. I recommend you click one of the links on this review and buy the book immediately. Read it. Feel the pain and hurt. Share it with a friend or a spouse and hopefully slowly, together, we can slay this dragon that has been harming our community for far too long.</p>
<p><em>(This book is for adults. I am not recommending this book for teens. Parents, use your own discretion.)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1036" title="Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/I9UB.jpg?resize=210%2C147" alt="Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg" data-recalc-dims="1" />Yesterday I flew from New York to Los Angeles. We got to the airport just under 3 hours before our flight. This is a direct result of missing a few flights in the last few years. We always err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>I stopped in a Hudson Books to peruse the available reading material. Prominently displayed was a new book by Ben Mezrich called &#8220;<a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385529376?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0385529376&quot;&gt;The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=" target="_blank">The Accidental Billionaires</a>&#8220;. I am a big fan of Mezrich having read, <a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060575123?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060575123&quot;&gt;Busting Vegas: A True Story of Monumental Excess, Sex, Love, Violence, and Beating the Odds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=" target="_blank">Busting Vegas</a>, <a style="&quot;width: 120px; height: 240px;" href="&lt;iframe src=" target="_blank">Rigged</a> and of course <a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416564195?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1416564195&quot;&gt;21: Bringing Down the House - Movie Tie-In: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=" target="_blank">Bringing Down the House</a> (I recommend all those books). I took a look at the book and discovered it was about the founding and founders of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>I bought the book.</p>
<p><span id="more-1033"></span>And so should you.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The book is interesting, tells a compelling story and most of all offers fantastic insight into our world. Facebook transformed the way we interact with each other on the web and in real life.</p>
<p>Before Facebook, the web was mostly information that <em>someone else </em>put on the web for you to learn from. The genius of Facebook is that it gave everyone the opportunity to share their lives with their friends on the web. Facebook is a web platform that is the really the voice of the people. Facebook wrestled the web away from corporate content providers and gave the power of the web to <em>you and me and our friends</em>.</p>
<p>Prior to Facebook there was MySpace. MySpace was and continues to be a big advertisement for one&#8217;s brand, band, etc. It is not a relationship building platform. Facebook is a place to meet and befriend people. It is your real life, just online. Facebook took the interactions of our daily lives and transported them onto a web page. That is why Facebook is not only the largest online community, but is also the most popular photo sharing site on the web. People share their lives in a natural way on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">Twitter</a> really took the Facebook lesson of sharing and community building and over-simplified it. Twitter has also become wildly successful because it builds community.</p>
<p>Understanding our highly interactive online world is important and this book really illuminates that reality.</p>
<p>The other thing that made the book powerful was the struggle the founders of Facebook encountered while attributed credit to the creator of Facebook.</p>
<p>See, Facebook wasn&#8217;t revolutionary. It was just social networking done the right way. Other folks had thought of similar sites and other sites were launched and they failed.</p>
<p>The tension over whose idea Facebook was is something that happens all the time in our modern world. People think of ideas or concepts at the same time as others. One of those parties may be successful with their version of the idea and the other version may fail. When the failing version owners realize they have not succeeded oftentimes they get angry, they file lawsuits, they yell and scream and make themselves look bad.</p>
<p>Much of the book is dedicated to appreciating this complex dynamic and it is a valuable lesson in modern fairness.</p>
<p>I recommend <a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385529376?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0385529376&quot;&gt;The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=" target="_blank">this book</a> (click to purchase) to anyone wishing to gain insight and appreciation for our interactive, modern, web based universe. As well as people who just like reading a good book about a college geek who became the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Mark-Zuckerberg_I9UB.html" target="_blank">youngest billionaire in the history of America</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the summer months many people find some extra time to catch up on their reading. By reading, I mean books with paper, ink, covers and turning pages. I don&#8217;t mean on a backlit display plugged into an electrical outlet.</p>
<p>This summer, I have been too busy to do any real substantive offline reading. I have done a lot of online reading, but my book reading has fallen behind.</p>
<p>One exception has been <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/06/book-review-dovbear-on-the-parsha/" target="_blank">DovBear on the Parsha, and you can read my review here.</a></p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is that in my &#8220;spare time&#8221; I usually end up reading up on Law School materials. I actually enjoy reading cases and Law Review articles, so my reading of other stuff has fallen a bit behind.</p>
<p>There is plenty of summer left and I thought it would be nice to provide some of my all time favorite reads and a quick note about why I like each book.</p>
<p><span id="more-855"></span></p>
<p>Click the title of the book to purchase on Amazon.</p>
<p>Please feel free to add your favorites, especially if you see my faves and think I would like your suggestions.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jewish Books</span></strong></p>

</em></strong></p>
<p>Written for Observant Jews and anyone else, the quintessential Rebbetzin Jungreis weaves together stories of commitment and dedication to life, love and spirituality. I confess to crying throughout the book and if you have an emotional side, this book will speak to you.</p>
<p><strong><em><a id="static_txt_preview" style="color:#003399;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568713568?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=1568713568">Letters to a Buddhist Jew</a> by Akiva Tatz<br />

<div>A series of letters between an expert in Jewish philosiphy and conservative Jew practicing Buddhism. The book compares and contrasts many of the overlapping features of both cultures shedding new light on both traditions.</div>

<div>Rabbi Matis Weinberg&#8217;s series on Torah is simply incredible. Full lenght essays on important topics highlighted by side notes citing sources from Shakespeare to &#8220;The Zen Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance&#8221;. Each essay provides new deep ideas and is worth the effort needed to really understand the point. All volumes are superb, I have linked my favorite, Exodus.</div>

</em></strong></p>
<div>Really all of Gladwell&#8217;s books are superb. Blink is my favorite because it applies to all of us. We are all experts in something and understanding how we can analyze things quickly and effectively gives us confidence in our decisions. Buy this book!</div>

<div>I love sports and I love business. This book melds the two and shows how statistics can mean more or less than they appear to mean. Also, it helps the average sports fan understand a lot of the behind the scenes of baseball.</div>

</em></strong></p>
<div>The compelling story of a Jewish MIT grad who took Vegas for millions of dollars in a few short years playing blackjack. A rare insight into genius minds, the greed of Vegas and the fine line between cheating and &#8220;gaining a competitive edge&#8221;.

<div>A charming book that makes us think about the small things in life. Moving and inspirational, this book is a super read.</div>
<div><strong><em><a id="static_txt_preview" style="color:#003399;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743253973?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0743253973">A Separate Peace</a><a href="0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank"> </a>by John Knowles</em></strong></div>
<div>My favorite book. This book is a parable about the male teenage years. Various events and reactions in the book give rise to situations we all can relate to our own lives. With piercingly sharp quotes and messages this book is timeless.</div>
<div><strong><em><a id="static_txt_preview" style="color:#003399;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8445074873?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=8445074873">Farenheit 451</a><a href="0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank"> </a>by Ray Bradbury</em></strong></div>
<div>A book about the &#8220;future&#8221; where thoughts are managed and controlled by a government opposed to reading. Some of the awful predictions in the book have come true. If you haven&#8217;t read this book, it is about time you did.</div>

<div>The most popular book of Lawyers and Law Students everywhere. The story of discrimination, a good lawyer&#8217;s fight against a corrupt society and the innocence of children.</div>
<div><strong><em><a id="static_txt_preview" style="color:#e47911;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385339100?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0385339100">The Partner</a><a href="0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank"> </a>by John Grisham</em></strong></div>
<div>I am not a huge Grisham fan but of his books that I have read this book is the one that I liked best. I won&#8217;t spoil it by telling you why I loved it, but after you read it send me an email and we can talk about it!</div>

On Thursday my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a><img style="border: none!important; margin: 0!important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00262OUR4" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> arrived at my summer residence and I was hoping to look it over on Shabbos.</p>
<p>At just over 175 pages I thought I would peruse the articles and formulate a general opinion of the book over Shabbos. Instead, I was so tired by the time Shabbos came along I decided to just read the first couple of chapters before heading to bed Friday night.</p>
<p>To my surprise I was unsuccessful in my goal&#8230; I started the book after the Friday night meal and I went to sleep at 11:30 PM, after I had read the entire book cover to cover (not just the first couple chapters). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is a true page turner.<span id="more-825"></span></p>
<p>I was spellbound and mesmerized. As I was reading I felt myself running through the full gamut of emotions. The book made me laugh, cry, agree, disagree, shake my head, nod my head, upset, happy, disappointed, thrilled and thirsty for more.</p>
<p>Before I begin the substantive review, I would be remiss if I did not mention that I found the dedication and acknowledgements sweet and honest. It was not contrived as some cheesy dedications are and it only added to the power of the book. The book certainly starts on the right foot.</p>
<p>First, allow me to say, the book demonstrates DovBear&#8217;s tremendous breadth of Torah knowledge. The sheer number of Torah commentaries, Midrashim, Talmudic passages and contemporary opinions presented represents a life&#8217;s work devoted to understanding and appreciating Torah.</p>
<p>Too many of us &#8220;punch in&#8221; at the local Daf Yomi instead of &#8220;tuning in&#8221; to our learning. This book demonstrates the latter.</p>
<p>Second, the insights are impeccable. I found myself time and time again wishing that I had thought of what I was reading. Much of it seems so obvious and yet elusive to the average observant Jew.</p>
<p>In particular the observations made in &#8220;Eliezer and his 318 Men is obviously the correct reading of the material and yet I have never heard it before! Perhaps, I would have seen it myself in the original text down the road, but the way DovBear seemlessly integrates the words of the commentaries with the Torah gives life and a spark to the commentaries quoted.Similarly, the sentiment expressed in &#8220;What Was Rivka Playing At&#8221; and &#8220;Esav Enigma&#8221; is something I talk about often but is foreign to many learned Jews.</p>
<p>A clarity of thought and of writing makes some difficult concepts more palatable and easier to appreciate. But the depth of the content is not compromised by its simple tone. Each short essay (almost each essay) provides deeper insight into some of the most complex sections of the Chumash. Such as, the story of Tamar, Yaakov stealing the Blessings from Esav, the curse of Cham, the sin of the Spies and the first Shabbos violator.</p>
<p>Third, the aesthetics of the typography and layout is pleasing. So often a book is well written but so hard to read because of the obvious lack of attention paid to the reader&#8217;s eyes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is easy to read linguistically and physically.</p>
<p>Next, the essays. Many essays were outstanding. My overall favorites (I could be missing a few) are: Rainbows, The Curse of Ham, A Twenty First Century Sodom?, Why Was Isaac Blind?, Salt and Straw, Marrying Sisters, Leah&#8217;s Lament, Esav Sonei L&#8217;Yaakov, Tamar&#8217;s Tale, Abominations, Stoned, Talking Torah with the Baby Bears and What Remains of my Favorite Post. I regret that I read it on Shabbos, because I kept on thinking &#8220;I have a great kneitch to add here&#8221;, or &#8220;that is just like something I once saw on something else&#8221;, or &#8220;that is such a pet peeve of mine as well&#8221;, and I wish I could have annotated the book with my thoughts.</p>
<p>To me, that is the greatest asset of the book. It provides real (fast) food for thought on an unlimited number of Torah subjects. The essays are not ends in themselves, they are starting points for discussion and beginning point to understanding Torah more deeply.</p>
<p>There were a couple of essays which I disagreed with on a theological basis. That is a good thing. That means that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is pushing us to challenge and think. Too often we accept and move on. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> takes that away from its reader and I think that is wonderful.</p>
<p>What moved me the most was DovBear&#8217;s unyielding devotion and dedication to Torah. Questions, answers, problems, solutions, issues and explanations did not deter DovBear as throughout the book he remained dedicated to Torah and mitzvos. It was clear to me, the reader, that DovBear is passionate about his Judaism and takes pride in his adherence to Torah and mitzva observance.</p>
<p>I felt this particularly due to the joy that jumps off the page in DovBear&#8217;s tone as he writes a new insight or thought. The sheer enjoyment is palpable and to me, only a feeling felt through a real dedication to Torah Judaism.</p>
<p>The final essay in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is &#8220;<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2005/02/great-moments-in-torah-commentary.html" target="_blank">What Remains of My Favorite Post</a>&#8220;. The relevant quote is here:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Any two-bit exegete can flatter his colleagues and offer simpering praise. That sort of behavior may suggest manners, but it doesn&#8217;t demonstrate brains, talent or confidence. Endless praise is the behavior of a </em><a style="color: #3d81ee; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.akademik.cz/ias/GFX/smithers.gif"><em>sycophant</em></a><em>, someone who values popularity over truth and integrity. Is that really what we want&#8230;</em><em>? An endless exchange of Valentines?</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>As a blogger who has been </em><a style="color: #3d81ee; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://benchorin.blogspot.com/2004/12/dovbear-reacts-to-my-previous-post.html"><em>smacked around </em></a><em>(and who has done his share of </em><a style="color: #3d81ee; text-decoration: underline;" href="http://biurchametz.blogspot.com/2004/11/terrorism-only-for-consenting-adults_09.html"><em>smacking</em></a><em>) I can relate. The roughness is how some people prefer to communicate but it&#8217;s always sign of respect to be noticed, and mentioned. Moreover, rough language often comes with the territory when ideas are at stake.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>With this thought, DovBear has given license to his readers to criticize. A review with no criticism would be shallow and empty. It is in this light that I present my sole critique.</p>
<p>Imagine you buy a brand new car. Let&#8217;s say you got your first new Lexus. It is a beauty and something you have coveted for years. You get into your new ride and turn the key, ahhhh, the engine roars to life. You exert some pressure on the gas pedal, ahhhh, the cars purrs as it accelerates. Your hand reaches for the radio and you push the power button and&#8230; nothing. The radio doesn&#8217;t work. Big deal, right? The car is a Lexus, you didn&#8217;t get a Lexus for the radio &#8211; right? But it still bothers you &#8211; right?</p>
<p>That is how I felt a couple of times while reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a>. The content is so good and yet it could use another good proof-reading. There are more than a few typos. There is a lack of consistency in the transliterations. For example one (great) essay is title &#8220;Makot Machlokes&#8221;. Those two spellings are contradictory. Makot is a sephardic pronunciation and Machlokes is an ashkenazic pronunciation. Throughout the book we are treated to both variants with no consistency. Similarly, in a post titled &#8220;Mean Loez&#8221;, the Me&#8217;am Loez is spelled Meam and Me&#8217;am.</p>
<p>This is just like the radio not working in the Lexus. I don&#8217;t tune in to DovBear for perfectly consistent writing style I tune in for substance. But the lack of attention to the nitty gritty in the writing does not do the rest of the book justice. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is too good a book for the reader to be annoyed by typos and inconsistencies.</p>
<p>My only other critique (if this is even a critique) is the lack of content on the summer Parshios and the book of Devarim. I simply wish there was more content in the book.</p>
<p>In summary, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is a masterpiece. It is a masterpiece because so few of us could even write a book like this. Most lay people are not producing innovative thought on Torah and our Rabbis and teachers focus on so many other corners of Torah. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> is a mechayev on all of us to think, challenge, study and grow in our Torah study. Each short essay can evoke emotion and thought from its reader.</p>
<p>I recommed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00262OUR4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00262OUR4">DovBear on the Parsha</a> for every Jewish home. You will probably find yourself agreeing with most of what DovBear has written. And even if you disagree with everything in the book it will still be a worthwhile, if not important read.</p>
