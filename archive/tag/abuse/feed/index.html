				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A couple of weeks ago, The Atlantic ran an article written by the loving wife of a victim of childhood sexual abuse. The article is difficult to read yet doubly rewarding. First, the appreciation for the challenges abuse victims encounter and how they affect those who love them and second, the very sweet end of the article nearly outweighs the darkness of the rest of the article.</p>
<p>I have often (naively) said that if the <em>gedolim </em>would really understand the way abuse affects its victims, it they would really comprehend the trauma and horrors of abuse they would not hesitate to report abuse to the police.<span id="more-7615"></span> I&#8217;ve been told that the <em>gedolim </em>have been made aware of the severity of abuse and to no avail. This article would be part of that presentation that I naively think would change their minds on abuse. In a very direct and practical way, this article demonstrates just how deeply the victim of abuse feels their pain. Further, it illustrates how far reaching the trauma of abuse can be. It affects so many people beyond the initial victim.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7616" alt="discriminacion-mayorias-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/discriminacion-mayorias-2-600x424.jpg" /><br />
For that reason alone I recommend reading the article.</p>
<p>But there is so much more. In a large portion of the orthodox Jewish world, young men and women meet upon the approval of their parents. Mothers and fathers vet possible date prospects for their children. They rarely know these prospective mates personally. Rather, resumes are distributed and phone calls are placed to common friends and beyond. Parents are often overwhelmed with suggestions. It&#8217;s easy enough to eliminate the damaged goods before even embarking on a thorough investigation.But unfortunately there is a negative consequence to this kind of education in the orthodox Jewish community. Because victims of abuse are dealing with so much in their lives, they can be stigmatized and shunned as potential spouses.</p>
<p>Divorced parents? No thanks. Brother is no longer frum? No thanks. Sister didn&#8217;t go to seminary? No thanks. He&#8217;s in college? No way. She&#8217;s in law school? No thanks. Baal Teshuva? No thanks. At risk teen who figured things out at around 20 years old? No thanks.</p>
<p>Superficial details that have almost zero value in determining the true nature of the prospect can eliminate the prospect from contention very early on in the process. This results in a haves and have nots environment.</p>
<p>Organic dating avoids this issue. Boys meets girl, they get on well, they get to know each other, the develop feelings for one another, and then the superficial details emerge. By that time, very few sane people would toss out a relationship because his parents are divorced or she has a brother who is not frum. The relationship is more important than those petty details.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic dating has its own set of problems that the shidduch system can help avoid. I am not arguing in favor or against shidduch dating in this post. It&#8217;s just the reality of the shidduch scene that this is what happens.</p>
<p>According to my anecdotal, non-scientific research and basic reasoning skills, one of the greatest fears that frum abuse victims have is that they will be branded as damaged goods and find themselves at the bottom of the shidduch Totem pole. It is a legitimate fear. It&#8217;s stupid, but it is probably what would to happen. If parents hear a potential shidduch candidate was abused it makes sense within the misplaced priorities and confines of the shidduch system that they would just eliminate that person from consideration immediately.</p>
<p>By contrast, the first thing you learn about someone after meeting them is usually not whether they were abused. Obviously. In a good relationship, eventually it is likely to be disclosed and discovered and most probably dealt with together. So the abuse issue only arises once there is a couple with an existing relationship. If the abuse creates an unhealthy environment for a relationship that might doom the couple. But the information alone does not torpedo the relationship like it can within the shidduch system.</p>
<p>Thus, as much as we need to educate ourselves and our communities about the horrors of abuse, we also need to be careful not to allow ourselves to think that abuse victims are damaged goods who should be placed on the bottom of the deck when it comes to shidduchim. It&#8217;s a very difficult and narrow path to navigate but it is a necessary one. One solution to this problem might be jettisoning the shidduch system. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen. Instead, I think we will need to make a conscious effort to walk this tightrope. Let victims know that we empathize with their pain and their struggles. But we also are careful to make sure that victims know that we believe in them and in their ability to lead proud, confident, and successful lives. We all have challenges in life. Victims of abuse may have struggles that are more public than others, but we all have our struggles and no one group should have their struggles written off as inferior or that their struggles should automatically disqualify them from living orthodox Jewish life at its fullest.</p>
<p>For that matter, none of the superficial shidduch disqualifications make any sense. Let&#8217;s do away with all of them. But I think the abuse issue needs attention first because of how far behind we are in handling abuse and because suffering in silence compounds the trauma of abuse.</p>
<p>Please read the article and let&#8217;s start working together on the healing process, both individual and communal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>It takes courage for any victim of abuse to come forward and accuse their abuser. It&#8217;s almost suicidal to try it in New Square. Yet, that is just what a young man named Yossi has done.</p>
<p>He sat down with News 12 Westchester for an in depth report. Journalist Tara Rosenblum talked with Yossi and spent some time in New Square researching this story. She does an excellent job.  If she&#8217;s eligible, I vote this reporter for the Pulitzer.<span id="more-7598"></span></p>
<p>The heartbreaking part of this is neighbors and children naively believing that the abuser Herschel Taubenfeld is not only innocent, but he is a safe person around their children. He is not. Yet, he is teaching in the school and mothers have no problem with it whatsoever.</p>
<p><img class="alignright  wp-image-7602" alt="Screen Shot 2013-08-31 at 10.39.14 PM" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.39.14-PM-600x340.png" width="420" height="238" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s even worse is that Yossi, for all his bravery, did not even manage to keep Taubenfeld off the streets. The Ramapo DA thinks that six years probation is going to keep kids safe. I don&#8217;t see how that&#8217;s possible. No one is going to report this guy to the police again so it&#8217;s unlikely that his probation will deter him nor will he ever violate the probation because he will never be reported.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how Rabbi Noson Leiter got involved in this case. I thought his thing was being anti-gay marriage. Anyway, he says the right things even if his part of the segment made me cringe.</p>
<p>This kid gets a medal for coming forward and hopefully he can inspire some sanity to this town. At the very least, people who don&#8217;t live in New Square should not be supporting or visiting this make believe city upon a hill until they get their act together. Attempted murder and rape can not be tolerated but in New Square they are. It&#8217;s time for the good people of the world to make it stop.</p>
<p>Watch the segment and cheer for Yossi.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>There was a great article in the NY Times last week about nostalgia. I believe that nostalgia is a very important element of the religious experience. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/03/21/the-magical-secret-of-the-seder/">The Magical Secret of the Seder</a>)</p>
<p>I had no idea that until recently nostalgia was considered a mental disorder. Apparently, it was thought to be akin to depression. But people who were nostalgic were not sad and so research commenced to determine the proper classification and function of nostalgia.</p>
<p>It turns out that nostalgia is actually pretty useful. Studies have shown that nostalgia can make people feel happier, can physically warm the body, can give people hope, and overall improve one&#8217;s life. This all serves very important evolutionary purposes. Modernly, it helps with relationships in general and in particular with marriage. Good memories make for good relationships.<span id="more-7393"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7394" alt="V7K1cJRPaafgLZP" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/V7K1cJRPaafgLZP-600x450.jpg" /></p>
<p>Looking at nostalgia through the lens of the religious person, nostalgia becomes even more useful. If our religion gives us good memories and makes us feel good when we are young it is going to be important to us to relive those memories year to year and life event to life event. Even more importantly, it motivates us to give our children similar experiences. We want our children to look fondly upon their youth and we want religion to be front and center in their positive memories.</p>
<p>I think we should cultivate good memories. We should create our own nostalgia. We should actively mine those memories for good feelings towards people, family, spouses, and of course religion. Jewish holidays are perfect for this kind of work but really it should be a full time effort.</p>
<p>All this leads me to two issues that are plaguing the orthodox Jewish community right now.</p>
<p>Victims of sex abuse invoke many coping mechanisms to deal with the betrayal and violence of the crimes perpetrated against them. Obviously, if the abuser is an authority or religious figure, the victim&#8217;s associations with religion become supremely negative. There is little religious nostalgia for victims. Even worse, is when the coping mechanism involves repressing memories of one&#8217;s childhood. Some victims cannot even remember their childhood. Clearly, these victims have no nostalgia towards their religion. They may stay in the fold for other reasons, but an important part of their religious experience is left with a gaping hole instead of positive memories. Aside from robbing children of their innocence and inflicting untold pain of their victims, predators paint over their victim&#8217;s childhood memories with a very big, very dark brush. This has many negative consequences, including religious consequences.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have witnessed there is a recent spate of <i>baalei teshuva </i>returning to their prior lives and leaving orthodox Judaism. This group also lacks the nostalgia of an orthodox Jewish upbringing. This is not a defect. It can be a difference that does not make a distinction. But for some people, it can be hard to stay in the orthodox Jewish community and for some of those people nostalgia is a decent motivating factor. Unfortunately, those who choose to become orthodox later in life lack this secret weapon. Sometimes that can make all the difference in the world between staying or leaving.</p>
<p>The article in the NY Times corroborates what I think is a very underappreciated part of being an orthodox Jew. Nostalgia. Those who are missing it, whether because of despicable violence or courage to choose orthodox Judaism are often missing this non-essential ingredient. But we all have the power to give it to our children and I contend that it&#8217;s a very worthwhile endeavor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/liar.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7257" alt="liar" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/liar-300x292.jpg" width="300" height="292" /></a>One of the primary concerns in the orthodox Jewish community when discussing the issue of reporting sex abuse to the authorities is that inevitably there will be false accusations that will ruin the lives of innocent people. It is very scary to think that someone can be named as an abuser and before any evidence is presented the accused can be found guilty in the court of public opinion. In a community where the main currency is reputation and communal standing false accusations can have drastic consequences.</p>
<p>This is a good reason not to judge people before the facts are known and also a good argument against placing too much stock in reputation. Changing our approach on these issues would go a long way to making our communities safer places.</p>
<p>Whether concern over false accusations is a legitimate reason to require rabbinic approval before going to the authorities is a discussion for another time. I don&#8217;t see why should be any different than other non-orthodox Jewish communities, but again, not the discussion here.</p>
<p>The NY Times has a very (appropriately) one-sided article on the Baruch Lebovits and Sam Kellner situation.<span id="more-7256"></span> In short, Lebovits is a known sex abuser, he molested Kellner&#8217;s son, Kellner got permission from a rabbinic court to pursue Lebovits in criminal proceedings, and Lebovits was convicted. Kellner was a hero and symbol of strength in the victims advocates community. Then Kellner was convicted of obstruction for allegedly offering money for testimony and threatening to extort Lebovitz&#8217;s family. Kellner was charged and to add insult to injury, Lebovits&#8217;s conviction was overturned. He awaits retrial.</p>
<p>The Times quotes a rabbi who advised Kellner to go to the authorities as saying that if Kellner goes to jail it will have the effect of preventing future victims from coming forward. It&#8217;s hard enough to come forward in the community but it will be even harder if a strong advocate for victims of abuse finds himself in trouble with the law.</p>
<p>The merits of Kellner&#8217;s case notwithstanding, I think it could be argued that a conviction of Kellner would have the opposite effect. If one concern with reporting abuse to the authorities is the fear of false accusations, it is possible that seeing Kellner&#8217;s troubles with the law could mitigate this fear. Clearly, the law does not take kindly to those who are deceptive or dishonest when reporting allegations of abuse. Thus it stands to reason that we need not be terribly concerned that false allegations would occur frequently.</p>
<p>The Brian Banks case illustrates this same idea. Banks was a rising college football star when he plead guilty to rape. The accuser admitted to lying after Banks sat in jail for several years. Banks was released and now his accuser is being sued for millions of dollars. She will probably lose too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that Banks was falsely accused and proponents of rabbinic go-betweens might point to the case to show how dangerous it can be to just go to the authorities without an independent investigation. However, the fact that the false accuser stands to lose millions of dollars in civil court, not to mention possible criminal prosecution actually serves as a huge deterrent. Certainly these kinds of consequences to false accusations will serve as a barrier to future false accusations.</p>
<p>The point is that false accusations happen from time to time. But when they do happen there are severe consequences. It&#8217;s unlikely that people would be willing to risk suffering those severe consequences when there is no basis for their accusation. We should not be afraid that these stories will chill allegations of abuse in our community. We should use these stories as examples of the fidelity of the criminal justice system and hopefully our community will encourage victims of abuse to come forward without being overly concerned with false accusations so that we can get to fixing this problem as quickly as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7081" alt="91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_-230x300.jpg" width="230" height="300" /></a>Over the weekend it was reported that a teacher in an orthodox Jewish school in Seattle has been charged with molesting two six year old girls in his class. It is suspected that this fellow molested more than just the two girls but he is only charged with molesting the two girls.</p>
<p>Sex abuse happens everywhere. It is no indictment of a school, community, or family if sex abuse occurs. The test is how sex abuse is dealt with. The most important question is whether the victim is able to articulate that they have been abused and that the victim has a safe place to talk about the abuse. If no one comes forward there is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>It takes great courage to come forward. But more importantly, it takes education to come forward. Our best defense against abuse is quite simply our children. If they are equipped with the tools necessary to prevent molestation and report it when it happens we have our first two lines of defense in place.</p>
<p>The prosecutor in the case in Seattle attributes the girls&#8217; willingness to come forward and their ability to articulate what happened to a book that is the brainchild of Rabbi Yakov Horowitz, written by Bracha Goetz and illustrated by Tova Leff. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a>. Incredibly, it took years for this book to see the light of day. But now it is endorsed by leading Torah authorities and it must be in every home and every school.</p>
<p><span id="more-7080"></span></p>
<p>In a sensitive way, the book gives children the tools to prevent abuse. When the book was released, I bought several copies of the book for my home and anywhere else I thought it necessary.</p>
<p>Just consider for a moment how incredible it is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> helped end a cycle of abuse in Seattle. It could do the same in your community. Get the book.</p>
<p>In places where abuse is not reported and not even acknowledged there is too much space for predators to wreak havoc. It is a matter of <em>sakanas nefashos, </em>we must act now. Our children must be educated. There are no excuses. We must educate our most insular communities on the harms of abuse and help them help themselves get out from under the cycle of abuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> is so versatile that it is not only a book that prevents abuse. The book also keeps children safe generally. Rabbi Horowitz shared with me a letter that he received from a learning disabled child thanking him for the book as it helped him in several situations. The letter is so sweet and innocent, it brought tears to my eyes. It is time for us to take this challenge and grab it by the horns. The first step is buying and using this book.</p>
<p>Aside from the book, Rabbi Horowitz has an excellent video on keeping our children safe. Watch that here: <a href="http://youtu.be/LWQHaInsCGk" target="_blank">YouTube</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6803" alt="Ravschwab1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Ravschwab1-193x300.png" width="193" height="300" />With all the excitement about R&#8217; Hershel Schachter&#8217;s comments last week, some discussion about the role of the lay people as critics of the rabbinic leadership has ensued. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, R&#8217; Shimon Schwab in Parshas Vayikra has an interesting, and particularly relevant thought on Torah leaders being criticized by their followers.</p>
<p>The verse says (JPS) <em>&#8220;When a ruler sinneth, and doeth through error any one of all the things which the LORD his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty: if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without blemish.&#8221; (Leviticus 4:22-23)</em></p>
<p>Rashi comments on the choice of language in the verse. The verse says &#8220;אִשֶׁר&#8221; - &#8221;when a ruler sinneth&#8221; and we would expect it to say &#8220;if a ruler sinneth&#8221; like it says previously with regard to the sin of a High Priest. Why? Rashi quotes the Toras Kohanim and says that the word is אִשֶׁר because it is reminiscent of the word אַשְׁרֵי &#8211; &#8220;fortunate.&#8221; Thus, &#8220;Fortunate is the generation whose leader [does not hold himself too high, but rather,] gives attention to bringing an atonement offering for his unintentional sins-and how much more will he experience remorse for the sins he has committed willfully!&#8221; (Translation of Rashi via Judaica Press).<span id="more-6802"></span></p>
<p>Rav Schwab quotes the Talmud in Chagiga 14A, <em>(translation via Soncino).</em> <em>&#8220;When R. Dimi came, he said: Eighteen curses did Isaiah pronounce upon Israel, yet he was not pacified until he pronounced upon them this verse: The child shall behave insolently against the aged, and the base against the honorable.&#8221; </em>The Talmud explains the verse: <em>Those persons who are empty of good deeds shall behave insolently against such as are filled with good deeds as a pomegranate with seeds. &#8216;And the base against the honorable&#8217;: to those to whom weighty [precepts] appear as light ones will come and behave insolently against those to whom light [precepts] appear as weighty ones.</em></p>
<p>In other words, Isaiah cursed the Jewish people with 18 curses. But that didn&#8217;t placate him. The only thing that calmed him down was this final idea, really two curses, that things would be so bad that the leaders would be severely criticized by people completely unworthy of making that criticism.</p>
<p>Rav Schwab asks, did Isaiah hate his fellow Jews? Eighteen curses weren&#8217;t enough? He needed two more? Isaiah needed to add insult to injury? And what about these last two curses made him feel better anyway?</p>
<p>Rav Schwab explains, that Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy here was that there would be a time where the unworthy, younger generation will have complaints against their elders and they will come to the carriers of Torah and lodge their complaints, and even the complainers will severely lacking in Mitzvos, still the criticisms will be lodged against the Torah leaders of the generation and raise their voice loudly when revealing a flaw in the acts of those leaders.</p>
<p>This is what comforted Isaiah. Even thought the situation will be disastrous following 18 curses the Torah leaders will be forced to be deliberate in their actions so that their mistakes will not be disclosed by the lesser worthy people who are lacking in righteousness. Isaiah can take comfort in this. The leaders may err, but there will always be followers to speak up when that happens.</p>
<p>The Talmud in Rosh Hashana (25B) similarly states &#8220;Praiseworthy is the generation where the great ones listen to the lesser ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what Rashi was referencing. A generation is fortunate when its leaders are able to recognize that they are mistaken. This comes from their followers who despite their sins and weaknesses criticize their leaders when necessary.</p>
<p>Seems appropriate considering the state of affairs in orthodox Judaism in general and in particular how our leadership is dealing with sexual abuse. Sometimes our leaders need the people beneath them to criticize them. Isaiah felt like that was a good thing according to Rav Schwab. I humbly agree.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6787" alt="IMG_3104" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3104-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" />R&#8217; Hershel Schachter whom I admire greatly, is in a bit of hot water. The Forward published an article that is misleading and inflammatory about R&#8217; Schachter.</p>
<p>The lede is particularly egregious: <em>&#8220;A top rabbinic dean of Yeshiva University has warned rabbis about the dangers of reporting child sex abuse allegations to the police because it could result in a Jew being jailed with a black inmate, or as he put it, “a schvartze,” who might want to kill him.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Sounds pretty bad, huh? Well once you actually read the article you see that it&#8217;s not quite so simple.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go in reverse order.<span id="more-6786"></span> R&#8217; Schachter is not a racist. This is a certainty. He doesn&#8217;t have a negative bone in his body. He is one of the nicest, sweetest people I have ever met. He also speaks in yiddish a lot. When he says the &#8220;S&#8221; word, he does not mean it in a negative sense. He means it as the yiddish word for black person. There may be a little of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/03/11/r-manis-friedman-and-dov-hikind-explained/" target="_blank"><em>this</em></a> here as well. Sure, it sounds bad when he adds &#8220;who wants to kill him&#8221; but in all likelihood he was simply using an example, a poor example, of someone who would be in harm&#8217;s way if they went to jail. <em>(Edit: It&#8217;s pretty clear he was referring to the Nation of Islam as a potentially dangerous cell mate.)</em> More on that later.</p>
<p>A for the abuse and the reporting of abuse, the Forward totally hides the ball. For all his genius and piety, R&#8217; Schachter is a genuinely committed halachic Jew. He does everything in accordance with halacha and his approach is to show how halacha would handle any potential situation.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter is among the most liberal halachic authorities when it comes to reporting abuse or any other crime to the secular authorities. I was in the room when I heard him say that there is no prohibition of mesira today. (For more on mesira see this: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/">Mesira in Halacha</a>.) This is a huge statement. One that the Forward should be championing. The primary obstacle to reporting abuse has classically been a misguided reliance on mesira. R&#8217; Schachter says there is no mesira. That&#8217;s huge. Pop the champagne.</p>
<p>However, in R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s opinion, one can&#8217;t go to the authorities unless one has something to report. Unless a victim can state facts with a fair amount of certainty, there is nothing to report. So if a victim comes forward and says &#8220;So and so abused me,&#8221; and there is reason to believe the victim, I am under the impression that R&#8217; Schachter holds that one is obligated to go to the authorities.</p>
<p>But the Forward doesn&#8217;t learn in a yeshiva. So the Forward doesn&#8217;t know that most of what we focus on in yeshiva are the non-obvious cases, the close calls, the cases that cut two ways or more. So R&#8217; Schachter spends considerable time on the borderline cases. He explains that when the veracity or factual basis of the claim is unclear you need to bring in professionals to assess the situation. That&#8217;s also the right idea! But it&#8217;s only in a small number of cases. Most cases are more clear cut. But in our Talmudic fashion, these abnormal cases become the focus of the discussion.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter sprinkles in an anecdote too. In the anecdote he is harsh to a possible victim. He advises the victim to go to a professional because he doesn&#8217;t have enough information to go to the authorities. The victim does not go. R&#8217; Schachter says that the victim is playing with fire. This is because more than anyone else, R&#8217; Schachter understands the gravity of allowing an abuser to run free.</p>
<p>So it is easy for the uninitiated to focus on this part of the conversation. The non-automatic cases. But that is a mistake. The primary points were already established: No mesira, if a victim comes forward go to the authorities. Sure, there are grey area cases and in those cases, one should try to figure out how to proceed using the best available professionals. This is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter also wants to show the gravity of a false accusation simply to show that halacha is concerned for everyone. The victim, the abuser, the falsely accused. All of them can be dealt with in the framework of halacha. Going to the authorities is very serious business. Halachically, we take responsibilty for what happens after we report abuse. We need to be careful and if we are careful, we must go to the authorities.</p>
<p>In my opinion, R&#8217; Schachter is one of our greatest authorities on this issue should be praised by the Forward, not maligned.</p>
<p><em>If you can&#8217;t see the difference between R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s situation and R&#8217; Manis Friedman&#8217;s and you need help, I am happy to assist you. But they have nothing to do with each other. Don&#8217;t even try to compare them.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6638" alt="Yeshiva-University1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Yeshiva-University1-295x300.jpg" width="295" height="300" />In the wake of the Weberman trial, the Forward published an expose on Yeshiva University, Rabbi Norman Lamm, and abusers George Finkelstein and Macy Gordon.</p>
<p>The relevant facts are that abuse of some sort was known to be taking place at MTA, the school did not report it, but eventually the abusers stopped working for the school. Nothing was publicized and nothing was reported. Rabbi Lamm knew about the abuse and decided to handle it privately. The extent of the abuse is unclear, but it seems that with one of the abusers was a sexualized version of wrestling, the other one is accused of far more heinous acts.</p>
<p>Rabbi Lamm, who is now 85, tried to explain YU&#8217;s lack of action. He said that things were different in those days. People didn&#8217;t quite know what to do about abuse.</p>
<p>It is easy to draw parallels between this case and the Weberman case. Both involved religious men who were accused of abuse. In both cases the religious institution protected its own interests and the interests of its employees over the safety of their students.</p>
<p>In some ways the YU case parallels the Penn State scandal as well. A very elderly statesman for a prestigious institution is embroiled in an abuse scandal for not taking care of the problem completely. The degree of abuse is different, and Rabbi Lamm didn&#8217;t enable the abusers, but there are some poignant similarities.</p>
<p>YU is guilty here. I believe that Rabbi Lamm could even face prosecution. Allowing abuse in our community is never acceptable.</p>
<p>But there are some very important distinctions between the Weberman case and the YU case.<span id="more-6637"></span></p>
<p>The most important distinction between YU and Satmar is the reaction of the community and the institution. YU has taken responsibility. YU apologized. YU has vowed to make sure this does not happen again. They have taken this on by the horns and are dealing with it appropriately.</p>
<p>Satmar has done nothing other than raise money for Weberman&#8217;s defense, publish articles blaming the media, terrorized witnesses and supporters of Weberman&#8217;s victim, and worst of all &#8211; not used this is an opportunity to educated their public about the horrors of abuse and ways to prevent it. It&#8217;s inexcusable, really.</p>
<p>To me, this makes a huge difference. It show that YU has learned from its mistakes and will do whatever it takes to prevent future abuse. YU will be a partner in ending abuse not a partner in perpetrating abuse. Satmar is the latter.</p>
<p>Some will argue, in defense of YU, that they didn&#8217;t really understand abuse back in the day and they thought it was best to deal with it privately. I think this is a terrible argument. Mandated reporting laws were passed precisely to educate the public and gatekeepers that they must report abuse. These laws are designed to take the decision out of the hands of the institution. YU ignored these laws (as far as I know) and pushed a predator out the door into some other institution. There is no excuse for ignorance. The law is clear.</p>
<p>In this respect, YU and Satmar are similar. Satmar is just 30 years behind. Well that&#8217;s to be expected. They are living in a recreation of 18th century eastern Europe. Of course they don&#8217;t get the horrors of abuse. But it&#8217;s not an excuse for Satmar in 2012 and similarly it is not an excuse for YU in 1985.</p>
<p>However, YU has clearly learned their lesson. This does give me a glimmer of hope that Satmar can learn their lesson too. But YU&#8217;s philosophy is to live in the present, Satmar&#8217;s philosophy is to recreate the past. YU celebrates science and research. Satmar demonizes it. This might prove a fatal flaw to by hope that Satmar will adjust. But if the Satmar community demands it and there is enough of an outcry over their disastrous record on abuse, maybe, just maybe Satmar can sheepishly follow in the footsteps of YU and enter the 21st century.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CNN-Breaking-News-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5738" title="CNN-Breaking-News-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CNN-Breaking-News-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180" /></a>It was only a matter of time. The national media has picked up the most important story in the orthodox Jewish community of our day. Nothing compares to this. Not Internet bans or Siyum celebrations or kosher hot dogs. This is THE issue of our time.</p>
<p>CNN does a superficial but somewhat thorough and honest segment on abuse in the chasidic community.</p>
<p>I have embedded the report below. You can watch it, share it, and cry for the victims.</p>
<p>I will just make several bullet points:<span id="more-5737"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The segment is not sensationalist or riddled with half-truths. It is honest and straightforward.</li>
<li>Denial is a powerful drug.</li>
<li>I honestly believe that Hynes is not &#8220;protecting abusers&#8221; for the sake of votes. I think he can&#8217;t prosecute without witnesses and he needs cooperation from victims to prosecute. (I wrote about that here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</li>
<li>One in five being abused is a number that is not scientific but is very possible. One in five thousand would be enough to push us to deal with the issue. One in five is a number that demands immediate and powerful action.</li>
<li>The intimidation of victims and their families should warrant its own segment. Protecting abusers and sacrificing victims is not just heartless and stupid, it compounds the effects of abuse by giving victims the right to think that they are sacrifices and I believe can be linked to victim suicide.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s obviously not just in the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish communities that abuse occurs, but the approach to dealing with abuse is the main difference between the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish community and the rest of the world. We are not equipped to deal with it internally even if we admit that we have a problem. How could we be?</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/WSJ460.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5522" title="WSJ460" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/WSJ460-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a>The Wall Street Journal is taking its turn with the orthodox Jewish community following yesterday&#8217;s article in the NY Times. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/09/the-ny-times-article-on-sex-abuse-in-the-ultra-orthodox-jewish-community/">The NY Times Article on Sex Abuse in the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Community</a>)</p>
<p>The article attempts to explain the reasons for the upcoming gathering at Citifield and the arguments against the gathering. It is pretty fair. I don&#8217;t have any particular problems with the article.</p>
<p>My problems are with Eytan Kobre who is quoted extensively in the article. The article names him as a spokesperson for the event. I  spoke directly to people involved in the planning of the Asifa. I spoke to many other people who spoke to people involved in the Asifa. I never heard this man&#8217;s name mentioned a single time. It&#8217;s almost as if he was given the title of spokesman just for the article.</p>
<p>When asked about who would be on the program, the spokesman had no response.<span id="more-5521"></span> Some spokesman.</p>
<p>His sales pitch was this gem: <em>&#8220;Hopefully we&#8217;ll fill the role that the Jewish people have tried to fill from time memorial, which is serving as a beacon to the world and as a force for the transformation of the good in society.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Does he not know that intelligent people all over the world have been taking precautions against the harms of the Internet over the last 20 years? Does he not realize that filtering companies have millions of subscribers without the orthodox Jewish subscribers? You are late to the party. You can&#8217;t be a beacon when you wake up years after everyone else. The gathering is necessary simply because the attendees are less likely to listen to the good, wise advice of non-orthodox Jewish experts and are only willing to rely on the advice of a rabbi.</p>
<p>But when asked about the counter protest dubbed &#8220;The Internet is Not Your Problem&#8221; that is highlighting victims of sex abuse and the protecting of abusers in the orthodox community, Kobre said: <em>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s a legitimate issue or not, and I&#8217;m willing to posit that it is a legitimate issue, are they really going to make progress on it by holding a counter rally? It seems like a cheap political circus. It&#8217;s sad. It&#8217;s unfortunate.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>If rallies don&#8217;t accomplish anything, what in the world are you going to accomplish at an Internet rally? Also, very benevolent of him to posit that sex abuse is a legitimate issue.</p>
<p>Another disappointment was the spokesman&#8217;s statement about what the gathering will advise. Every person I have spoken to about the Asifa assured me that there would be no objective standard. Each family will follow its communal standard. Some people will only use the Internet for Torah learning. Some will also use it for news. Some will also use it for reading fiction, or non-fiction. Others will use if for social purposes like sharing photos and videos. Others will use it for fun and engage others with social media. And even others may use it to watch a movie or TV show. Each family according to their standard. But the important thing is that everyone is aware that it takes vigilance and education to maintain that standard with the Internet in one&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>However, Kobre lay down the law. He said the Asifa will recommend that people <em>&#8220;block out all social-media sites including Facebook and Twitter&#8221;. </em>This is contrary to everything I heard. If it is true I am upset that I was told differently. If it is not true I am upset that this is what he told the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>In other news, the event is sold out. I am flabbergasted and somewhat relieved. They managed to do it somehow and I am happy for them. I hope the event is a success and I also hope the counter rally is a success. We need people to take action and get involved wherever their passion lie. If not for my Law School graduation that day I might have flown to New York to attend both events.</p>
<p>Read the article for yourself. I spoke with the journalist for about an hour. That got condensed into a short soundbite. As I have been accused of doing for my entire life, I &#8220;got the last word&#8221; in the article. So you&#8217;ll need to read all the way to the end.</p>
<p>If you have full access to the Wall Street Journal site read it on their site. If not, I have also linked a pdf version.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><div id="attachment_5510" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Orthodox-articleLarge.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5510" title="Orthodox-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Orthodox-articleLarge-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: NY Times</p></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s New York Times features a below the fold, front page article on sex abuse in the Hasidic community of New York. It&#8217;s usually not a good thing when orthodox Jews are on the front page of a newspaper, even below the fold. I am aware that this article reflects poorly on Hasidic Jews in particular and orthodox Jews in general. But I have to say that I found the article to be pretty fair overall and an excellent assessment of the situation.</p>
<p>Contra the article in the Forward, this article does not focus on DA Hynes (although it seems there will be an article about him tomorrow), the article in the NY Times focuses on the victims and the social pressure not to report incidents of abuse.</p>
<p>This is the real problem. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</p>
<p>The article tells the story of several victims and their families who did report the abuse to authorities only to find that they were shunned, excommunicated, or bought off. </p>
<p><span id="more-5509"></span></p>
<p>According to the article it goes all the way to the top. A family member of the Vizhnitz Rebbe in Monsey is alleged to have offered $20,000 to a victim&#8217;s family to drop charges. This is not some low level handler. This is not some shnook with a printer posting signs. This is the Grand Rebbe&#8217;s family. If that is how the leadership of thousands of Hasidic Jews handles abuse, what are we to expect from his followers?</p>
<p>Justice Guston L. Reichbach is a hero for standing up to the support of the community behind the accused and the lack of support for the victim. In court, he expressed deep disappointment with the community&#8217;s response in support of the abuser. He said there was a<em> &#8220;communal attitude that seeks to blame, indeed punish, victims.”</em> He also rebuked the multitude of Hasidic Jews in the courtroom standing in support of the abuser for writing letters in support of the defendant without a single word of <em>&#8220;any concern or any sympathy or even any acknowledgment for these young victims, which, frankly, I find shameful.”</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It was nice to see the workaround for <em>mesira</em> suggested by one rabbi, to tell a psychologist about the abuse and the psychologist will report it. This is completely unnecessary of course. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/">Mesira (The Jewish Informant) in Halacha</a></p>
<p>In addition to the text of the article, there are several very interesting documents attached. Take some time to read them. They are worth investigating.</p>
<p>Also, it is worth noting that there is no greater incidence of abuse in the ultra-orthodox community. There is just a much lower rate of reporting.</p>
<p>But the most difficult and heartbreaking part of the entire article was the quote from Rabbi Zweibel of the Agudah.</p>
<p>First of all, the Agudah has nothing to do with this. Hasidic groups could not care less what the Agudah says about sex abuse. So his quote is a non-sequitor. But he was asked his opinion and he reaffirmed with what we already know. His organization believes that a victim should go to a rabbi before going to the police. To be fair, the Agudah <em>expects </em>rabbis to be reasonable and advise bona fide victims to go to the police. However, there is little evidence that this will happen. I should also add that this is a step forward, believe it or not. It used to be that one was prohibited to go to the police at all, now one can go if a rabbi advises it. Baby steps.</p>
<p>But the worst part about what he said was this brusque comment: <em>&#8220;You can destroy a person’s life with a false report&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Absorb that for a moment.</p>
<p>The concern is that a false report could ruin someone&#8217;s life. I have two things to say about this. Both are very important.</p>
<p>First, this is built on a fallacious assumption. That is, that only rabbis have the ability to sniff out a false report and further that law enforcement is incapable of doing this task on their own. Both of this are horribly wrong. Rabbis are not trained to discern between true allegations, innuendo, and pure fabrication. Law enforcement professionals are trained to do that. They do it with regularity and with much success. Charges are not brought unless law enforcement is convinced that the abuse happened AND that it could be proved in a court of law. To say that rabbis are needed to protect innocent people who are falsely accused overstates their abilities and understates the reality.</p>
<p>But much, much, much more important is the implication of this policy. Victims of abuse have their entire lives ruined. One cannot overstate the effect of sexual abuse on a person. It haunts them every day of their life. Contemplating suicide is a normal response for a victim of abuse. It can become impossible for victims to function normally. Indeed, many victims have taken their own lives, unable to cope. Sex abuse kills. There are great rabbis who have held that an abuser is a <em>rodef</em>, a pursuer who is trying to kill someone, and anything and everything that can be done to stop them <em>must </em>be done. Sex abuse <em>destroys people&#8217;s lives.</em></p>
<p>I have <em>never </em>heard of someone who was falsely accused of a crime who committed suicide, who could not have a relationship with his or her spouse, who could not love, who could not trust, who could not cope with life. Is it an inconvenience? Absolutely. I  would not wish a false accusation on anybody. But to protect falsely accused people (which are a <em>very</em> rare occurrence) because it could ruin their life, when juxtaposed with the destruction caused by sex abuse comes off as so far removed from reality that it is scary.</p>
<p>To recap: Rabbis are not super-qualified to ascertain the truth of an accusation, law enforcement is qualified. False accusations are rare. When they occur they can harm a person&#8217;s life. To spare the falsely accused at the expense of victims is a heinous travesty of misplaced priorities. It is sick.</p>
<p>I want to end on a more positive note. My rabbis have all said that if one is a victim of abuse they <em>must </em>go to the police. These are ultra-orthodox rabbis. My point is that some rabbis get it. They were not the rabbis interviewed in the NY Times, but they are out there. <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/07/14/yadeinu-shafchu-es-hadam-hazeh/" target="_blank">As Rabbi Adlerstein wrote</a>, <em>&#8220;If your rov (rabbi) doesn’t get it, think of getting a new rov.&#8221;</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/image.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5430" title="charles hynes" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/image.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="255" /></a>The Forward is fuming at the Brooklyn district attorney for not releasing names of sex abuse suspects in the orthodox Jewish community. The Freedom of Information Act is supposed to give citizens access to government documents and information including the names of individuals arrested for sex abuse.</p>
<p>The DA explained to the Forward that these names are different than other names because they are all of the names requested are part of Hasidic groups and have allegedly abused Hasidic victims. Therefore there is a significant danger that the names of the victims would be discovered.</p>
<p>The Forward then cites several legal scholars who feel that this is an abuse of discretion by the DA. The reactions to this story have been equally heavy-handed. Some going as far as saying that DA Hynes is bought and paid for by the Hasidic community.<span id="more-5428"></span></p>
<p>In legal terms the decision might be wrong. But I don&#8217;t think the anger over this decision should be directed at Hynes and the DA&#8217;s office. I think they are acted reasonably under the circumstances. I really do.</p>
<p>In the Hasidic community, the understanding sex abuse is only its infant stages. Their reaction to abuse is pretty medieval. It&#8217;s hardly as if their is a firm grasp of the harms caused by abuse nor the proper approach to dealing with abuse. This is the reality. There is no way around it.</p>
<p>What would happen if the names were released and the victims names were discovered? It&#8217;s not far-fetched to assume that the victims would be outed. Once the names are outed you can be sure they would be called liars, <em>mosrim</em>, attention-seekers, and other names. It&#8217;s entirely possibly that some &#8220;well-meaning&#8221; vigilantes would take matters into their own hands and silence the victims with threats or violence.</p>
<p>The DA is correct in not releasing the names. But don&#8217;t blame him. Blame the community that would prefer to silence victims and reward its abusive members than do the right thing and weed out this horrible plague from its midst.</p>
<p>I am positive that if the community would deal with abuse like any other normal community the DA would feel comfortable releasing the names of the alleged abusers. But as it stands now, he cannot risk the health or even lives of the victims. I agree with this decision.</p>
<p>This does not give the DA a pass for not prosecuting cases from the community that should be prosecuted. But I think it goes to show just how difficult such prosecutions would be without the cooperation of witnesses and victims. The problem here is not the DA. In fact he understands the community better than his critics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a cover up at all. It&#8217;s protection.</p>
<p>Fix the community and justice will follow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/western_wall_2-1024x768.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5076" title="western_wall_2-1024x768" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/western_wall_2-1024x768-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The Jewish Week has an exposé on the controversial Rosh Yeshiva of a certain yeshiva in Israel. For purposes of this blog post, it is irrelevant who this person is and what yeshiva he presides over. I have not met this rabbi nor have I ever been in his yeshiva. I have no personal experience to draw from. The issue I would like to address is a general issue brought to light in discussions about this rabbi (and others).</p>
<p>Examples of behavior by this rabbi include, emotional manipulation, intense yelling, embarrassment in public, forcing boys to wait for him for hours on end after he called them in for a meeting, insulting students, gathering information from student&#8217;s therapists, among other anti-social behaviors all designed to elicit change in the recipient of the abuse. I call it abuse because without justification it certainly is abusive. The question is whether or not there is justification.</p>
<p>The claim has been made that the rabbi is a genius or savant who understands human nature so well that there is a method to the madness. It usually works. Sometimes it does not. The victims of cases where it does not work are the ones who speak out. The others are appreciative that it did work and claim that the rabbi is amazing.</p>
<p>Similar claims have been made about other rabbis. Sometimes the rabbis are too touchy-feely. They hug or kiss their students in a non-sexual way and for many this is a welcome sign of affection. For others it is abuse. Other rabbis have been said to have hit students. Sometimes the hitting was playful or with camaraderie, like when an athlete congratulates another athlete with more force than the average person can bear. Other times the hitting is unequivocally abusive.</p>
<p>I find these sorts of claims, whether emotional or physical or sexual to be under one broad category.<span id="more-5075"></span> I think they show poor judgment on the part of the rabbi. I <em>don&#8217;t</em> think they show absolute abuse. However, in the absence of proper judgment some of the acts or even many of the acts may have been abusive. In other words, I don&#8217;t think rabbis with wacky methodologies are intrinsically evil. Nor do I think that their successes justify their sometimes erroneous behavior.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes. I am sure these rabbis would admit to having made mistakes in their dealings with people. We all do. Rabbis are human. They should be held to the standard of human beings. That is, the standard of people who err and regret things they have done. People are complex. They are not all good, nor are they all bad. Trying to put this rabbi in either of those categories is folly.</p>
<p>What bothers me most are the absolutists.</p>
<p>On the one hand you have people saying the man should be fired, removed, lynched, exposed, no matter what. On the other hand you have people explaining away all the wrong things that occur because &#8220;he&#8217;s a genius&#8221; or because he knows exactly what he is doing. Neither of these positions is reasonable.</p>
<p>If the rabbi has done something illegal, morally repugnant or harmful to a student we would not be having this conversation. He has not. Rather, he has tread a fine line of questionable behavior. If that line is crossed there are ways to handle it. But that does not mean that in the meantime the acts should be hidden. Nor does it mean that he should be given a free pass.</p>
<p>As always, balance is the key. Some people work best in non-conventional ways. Students know what they are in for when they sign up to learn in the rabbi&#8217;s yeshiva. That does not give the rabbi license to do as he pleases with no regard for human life. It means if you don&#8217;t want to be in that kind of environment, don&#8217;t go. But if this rabbi even puts one toe over the line, he begins a walk down a treacherous path. It is difficult to live that kind of life. It&#8217;s his life, he can choose to try to pull it off. To this point, there is no evidence he has crossed the line. But Lord help him, if he does.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I think it would wise for the rabbi to tone it down. I don&#8217;t know if he can, or if he wants to. But that would be my advice. If he is such a genius of human nature, I am sure he will figure out how to help his students while avoiding questionable behavior.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/pointing-finger.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4844" title="pointing-finger" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/pointing-finger-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>The moral outrage over the Penn State scandal is reaching epic proportions. In the NY Times, David Brooks raises a salient point and it got me thinking. Brooks says that humans have a bad track record of speaking up when something needs to be said.</p>
<p>Everyone is horrified by the heinous acts alleged to have been committed by Jerry Sandusky. But there is another level of disdain for Joe Paterno, Mike McQueary and the police that investigated the accusations over the years. These people all contributed to the abuse. They either created or fostered an environment that tolerated abuse. They did not follow through on their professional responsibilities. They let the victims down.</p>
<p>It is easy to point the finger at these guilty parties and say they were wrong. It is also easy to say that if we were in their situation we would have acted more responsibly. Maybe many of us would have acted differently. We have no way of knowing for sure.</p>
<p>Similarly, we point fingers laced in guilt at the complicit parties in the Catholic Church scandal. I know there is the same sentiment among many orthodox Jews regarding abuse in the orthodox Jewish community. The finger pointers always say that they would not have covered it up. They would have done the moral thing and blown the whistle. Maybe they would have. But we we have no way of knowing for sure.<span id="more-4843"></span></p>
<p>My point is that this is the third scandal with the same kind of structure. An infallible leadership, concern over reputation, self imposed regulation and policing etc and all three scandals followed the same form.</p>
<p>Someone finds out about the abuse and the information is locked down. Nothing is done for years.</p>
<p>I used to be <em>really</em> mad at people who know about abuse and don&#8217;t say anything. I am still mad, but less mad. It seems that this cycle is almost inevitable. The people who did the covering up are just like you and me. They probably never thought they would not blow the whistle either. But it is not as easy as it seems.</p>
<p>When things happen and we judge others based on what we would have done, we are being disingenuous. There is no way for us to know if we would have had the courage to act in the way we think we would have acted.</p>
<p>Hillel, one of the great rabbis of the Mishna says: &#8220;<em>Don&#8217;t judge your friend until you reach his place. [And you will never </em><em>reach his place</em>.]&#8221; &#8211; Avos 2:5</p>
<p>The point is that we can all feel morally superior but we have no idea if we would have actually acted differently.</p>
<p>Our true anger should be directed at the systems that allow such a casual approach to such horrible things. The people who are in the system and don&#8217;t say anything are just part of a corrupt system. Sure, their complicity gives them a role in the system too. But I think it is very hard to buck an entire system. It is hard to swim upstream. It is hard to blow that whistle. That is why the whistle blowers are such heroes.</p>
<p>So in retrospect, looking at the feelings of anger and resentment I had toward the people in the institutions who did not do everything in their power to curb abuse, I feel differently now. I see a pattern that almost does not allow for whistle blowing. I am still upset that they did not do the right thing, but I can understand better how hard it is.</p>
<p>But this only increases my anger and disdain for the &#8220;system&#8221;. A system that is structured perfectly for predators will have predators. The system is bad, it is to blame, and must be fixed. The NCAA will look at their system, the Catholic Church has looked at their system and orthodox Judaism has also been looking at their system. But it will take courage to fix the system so that these heinous acts do not repeat themselves and force us to count on heroism.</p>
<p>We should not need to rely on heroes to save children from abuse. That is the most horrible thing about abuse in these communities. To protect children we are relying on heroes. We should be able to rely on the system.</p>

This was curious.  But some of Sandusky&#8217;s responses were even more curious.</p>
<p>Costas asked all the tough questions and I recommend reading the transcript and / or watching the video.</p>
<p>The thing that caught my eye the most was a Sandusky response to a very provocative Costas question.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the interview Costas asked Sandusky:<span id="more-4837"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Are you sexually attracted to young boys, to underage boys?</em></p>
<p>To which Sandusky, in classic Talmudic fashion, responds with a question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Am I sexually attracted to underage boys?</em></p>
<p>At this point every single normal human being is thinking this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION? HOW IS YOUR IMMEDIATE ANSWER &#8220;HECK NO!&#8221;? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?</strong></p>
<p>Being the nice guy (at least on Camera) that he is, Costas offers him a second chance and answers Sandusky&#8217;s ridiculous question. So Costas says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p>Sandusky realizes he better answer the question so he replies:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Sexually attracted, you know, I enjoy young people. I love to be around them. But no I&#8217;m not sexually attracted to young boys.</em></p>
<p><em></em>WHAT?! It took him three prefatory phrases to get to the word &#8220;No&#8221;. To me, this indicates something very significant.</p>
<p>Like most predators, Sandusky is oblivious to the peculiarity of his behavior. He thinks it is normal. He is not phased by the fact that someone just asked him about being sexually attracted to young boys. This is not normal.</p>
<p>At this point it is fair to say that whether Sandusky is guilty or innocent, he is a very strange man.</p>
<p>If someone would ask me or almost any of you reading this blog post the question that Bob Costas asked Jerry Sandusky I am confident that 99.99% of the group would react strongly and assertively that we are not attracted to young boys. Sandusky didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I believe that this fits the pathology of sexual predators. They don&#8217;t see themselves as doing anything wrong. They see their acts as normal. Perhaps at one time it was normal. I have heard of historical societies that did not frown upon this kind of behavior. That does not make it right, it just makes it less objectionable. But in our society it is considered abuse and a crime to do the things Sandusky is alleged to have done. It is objectionable. And it is up to us to be vigilant in protected our children and those who are dependent on us from predators.</p>
<p>Penn State failed the victims. Society failed the victims. But it is even more disturbing to get a peek into a twisted mind and see what is so patently obvious now but was ignored far too long.</p>
<p>That is, Mr. Sandusky is a sick man. Sick men will do harmful things to people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-105203.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4804" title="20111108-105203.jpg" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20111108-105203-300x217.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a>A scandal has rocked the NCAA Football landscape. A former Penn State football coach, Jerry Sandusky has been implicated by a grand jury. He is accused of sexually abusing young boys while he worked in an official capacity at the school and while working in an office on campus as part of a non-profit.</p>
<p>His boss was famed and revered football coaching legend Joe Paterno. Paterno is 84 years old. At some point the coach learned of the abuse and reported it to his boss, the Athletic Director. No further action was taken and Sandusky remained on the coaching staff at Penn State. The university administration did not report the abuse to the authorities. As mandated reporters this broke the law. They further complicated their situation by lying to the grand jury. Two administrators have been arrested for perjury failing to report the abuse.</p>
<p>The grand jury testimony contains some very graphic instances of abuse. It truly is horrifying.</p>
<p>An abusive person would be wise to position himself at a university. There is plenty of access to victims and the circumstances of working at a university make it easier to get away with abuse.<span id="more-4799"></span></p>
<p>I think the NCAA can be compared to the Catholic Church and orthodox Judaism to a certain degree. They are each closed environments with their own set of rules, codes and regulations. They give their leaders a lot of autonomy and hardly subject them to public scrutiny. Many of their proceedings and policy decisions are kept secret. And they have all had a hard time dealing with abuse in their communities. <em>(The NCAA is beyond corrupt but that&#8217;s another topic entirely&#8230;)</em></p>
<p>In my opinion, the best way for reluctant leaders to &#8220;repent&#8221; for their missteps with regard to abuse is by taking strong steps to ensure it does not happen anymore.</p>
<p>Many people are clamoring for Paterno to step down or for the university to fire him.</p>
<p>In this situation the most effective course of action will be one that will create a breach in the cone of silence within the NCAA and prevent future misdeeds and harm, especially with regarded to abuse. I don&#8217;t care if the abuse could be attributed to Paterno or not. I don&#8217;t care if Paterno broke the law or not. But I do care that more young boys not be abused in similar situations.</p>
<p>In this light I believe that Paterno should step down and make a strong statement saying that he is sorry for what happened under his watch. He should strongly condemn the acts and admit that his silence was wrong. He should put all abusers on watch and more importantly put all their protectors on watch. He should step down to say that he failed those young men who were abused and because of this he feels he is inadequate to continue in his capacity as Head Coach. He should talk about the horrors of abuse and the compounding effect that silence has upon victims. He should speak loudly and eloquently, like a good football coach.</p>
<p>He should not step down because he is too old nor should he step down because he failed the young men who were abused. He should not be fired for not doing the right thing nor should he be fired for protecting an abusive person. Rather, he should do whatever he can to make sure that the culture that permits abuse will not continue. I think the best way to do that will be for Paterno to use this platform, awareness and outrage to fix things for the future. I believe he can do that and if he would do that he would change his personal legacy from &#8220;abuse enabler&#8221; to &#8220;abuse fighter&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is too late to prevent the abuse that already happened but he can play a role in writing the future story of how the NCAA handles and deals with abuse.</p>
<p>Similarly, the religious institutions that have committed similar acts of tacit approval of abuse should use future or present incidents to make strong statements against abusers and their protectors. For the victims of these institutions and their abusers nothing can be done to change the past but if the institutions are strong enough to take a hard stance on future abuse their legacy in the arena of abuse can be changed forever.</p>
<p>I hope they do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><span style="color: #003366;"><strong><a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/typewriter_1_lg.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3352" title="typewriter_1_lg" src="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/typewriter_1_lg-300x206.gif" alt="" width="300" height="206" /></a>A couple days ago, I wrote a review of a book called Hush.

<p><em><span style="color: #003366;"><strong>I received this anonymous &#8220;stream of consciousness&#8221; email asking me to post her thoughts on the book and on the abuse situation in general. I have done just a tiny bit of editing but the emailer really wished that the note be presented in this raw form. I apologize for its length, but I encourage you to read it carefully and think about its message.</strong></span></em></p>
<p>Just to give you a bit of background on who I am. I did not grow up in the Chasidic world but in the orthodox yeshiva world. I went to the community yeshiva for elementary school and then to Bais Yaakov high school and  seminary in Israel (and a good one that’s hard to get into.) My brother was and is part of the Yeshiva world as well as the rest of my siblings. My family is a core part of the community and is well respected and liked by everyone. We were not a family with “issues” my family is wonderful and “normal” – or so it seems.</p>
<p>I’m not sure we to begin. I just finished reading the book Hush. I can’t stop crying the tears will not stop coming. Of course the book was moving and well written but most importantly, I think I am crying because I was Devory. I was the little girl who was molested by her brother.<span id="more-3351"></span></p>
<p>I think I am crying most right now because I am grateful. I am so overwhelmingly grateful for every minute I am alive longer than Devory.  I gave myself a chance at life and I didn’t even know it. I hate what she did to herself. I hate that she killed herself but I understand her. I now think to myself “why didn’t I kill myself?” I understand why people feel like they may want to; I may have felt like it at times too.  I understand how that guy who (may have) killed himself after he got married last year felt and I understand how Devory felt. I think all us victims feel it and understand it. I am crying now because I am grateful for my life as it is right now. I have SO much to be thankful for. Look how fortunate I am.  Look at my life and look what it turned into. I am so accomplished. I am a great mommy, wife, and friend.  Daughter, daughter in law, granddaughter, sister and so on…. I have a wonderful job and amazing friends. I live in a great community and everyone honestly loves me. People respect me a lot. I have amazing children thank God but most importantly I have an incredible marriage. And for this I have to thank my husband. Honey, I hope you are reading this and if you are &#8211; yes believe it or not it is me I actually wrote this and shared my feeling with others, Thank you from the bottom of my heart! I really do have the most unbelievable husband ever! He has always been there for me, and please god always will be. He stood beside me and encouraged me through the most difficult time of my life. (Admitting that it happened is actually even harder then being abused.) He gave me the courage I needed to heal. And trust me you need so much courage – it is so hard to face the truth. And he waited – he waited patiently for me to understand and make peace with my self in order to be a better wife and mother.</p>
<p>My husband is a lot like Gittel’s. Gittel’s husband is the hero of the story for me. He didn’t know what he was getting himself into. He didn’t know that she had a story and that she was scared and that a relationship would be difficult for her. He didn’t know that she had a traumatic past. He didn’t know it would be harder for her then it is for any other girl. And yet he stood by her, he supported her and gave her strength. My husband did too. I didn’t even know it would be so hard for me. But then when I got married and I was in a relationship and I had to share my life with someone and I was expected to have kids only then did I begin to realize that I was scared. That I didn’t want anyone to touch me. That I didn’t want to share my feelings with anyone. That I didn’t trust anyone. I didn’t realize that I became so good at living a fake feeling life and pretending that everything was rosy and great that I forgot how to actually feel real life. Only then did I realize that I kept a deep dark secret for over 10 years and that I shut out everyone and everything from my life. That I was living a fake life. On the outside everyone said wow look at her she is so pretty and so special and so popular and always so happy, “what a great girl” I want her for my son or nephew or cousin… but they didn’t know. They didn’t know that out of all my friends I did not have one single real friend that nobody actually knew a single thing about me. That although I have lots of siblings I didn’t feel like I had anyone. I felt like I lived in my own world. If anyone ever got too personal I just lied or made up stories. Reading this you probably think I am crazy but no one ever thought I was crazy, everyone thought I was normal and even special! And you know what, I am not crazy I knew I had to lie and hide this to protect my family – my parents and my other siblings (they don’t deserve this label) and I was and am willing to keep it all a secret and hurt myself so no one will ever think badly about my family. And you know what? I kind of still have to.</p>
<p>Like Gittel who only dealt with this after she got married so did I. It wasn’t such an issue for her until she was in a relationship. She too must have made a fake world for herself. Only when she was married and tried to get pregnant did she realize she couldn’t do it anymore. She couldn’t live the lie, pretend nothing had happened. And her husband was there for her when he found out he didn’t leave her but he encouraged her and he told her that she is a really and truly what an Aishes chayil is. And so did mine. He helped me through so much. He helped me admit that it happened and seek a therapists help and encouraged and stood by me through every single step of the way.</p>
<p>This is why I am still crying – we all unfortunately know that this is out there. And there has been so much support and understanding from all of you to help this issue get out there – and thank you for that. But many of you think &#8220;thank GD it didn’t happen to me&#8221; or worse, &#8220;of course this didn’t happen to me&#8221;. And I wont marry someone who is “damaged goods” (and bloggers out there, this is you&#8217;re line, I read it myself many times on blogs) or I wont let my kids near someone who is damaged. But in our “secret” orthodox world you have no idea who or when you will meet or befriend someone who is a victim like me. Who knows? If my in-laws knew this about me they may not have let us get married. But they didn’t know and you know what they don’t either know something else, they don’t know their own son was abused too. And I have to say they are really truly amazing parents. They just have no idea – just like my parents. And you have no idea either. It could be any of us. Don’t judge. Don’t be harsh.  Don’t say we need to do something about this, get rid of the bad guys and then just turn your backs on us victims and isolate us. We are a part of you and we need you to accept us.  I beg you please be there for that person help them through it don’t think of them as a crazy person like Devory or the others who have done like she did. Realize that it wasn’t our fault we didn’t do anything wrong it happened to us and we already suffered so much, please be there for us now. Don’t just say those schools or shuls they need to fire those Rabbis they need to do “something”…. Be that person who does something. Please don’t think of us as damaged goods anymore please accept us and love us and realize we already suffered enough. Don’t say I wont let my kids marry someone like that…</p>
<p>We are doing so much to get rid of the people who are abusing others; but we need to do more to accept those of us who have been their victims. Don’t avoid us, don’t treat us different, just be our friend. Let your children be our friend, let your children marry us. Please. Those of us who have been abused and who are still here today did not end it all. We survived it and we know we will be okay. Our lives are so much more precious. We know that it didn’t have to be this way. I didn’t have to survive. I didn’t have to have the great life that I have now. But I do. And I am so thankful for my amazing children, family and husband. And most of all, for my life. I will forever make every minute count. I will count each blessing that I have and realize that I may not of had it had a chosen a different path. I will cry harder then you when my babies are born and when I send my kids off to school. I will cry so hard when I walk them down the aisle and when they have their children.  They will be tears of joy because I will remember that I was given a second chance. And I want you all to know that whether you have been abused or know someone who has been abused, please take the time to make this second chance at life meaningful don’t turn your backs on it and don’t ignore it. And please don’t think that we are crazy or to stuck in our “victimhood”, but just like I am finding my life to be a second chance, you can too. Make my choice matter. Help me and help every victim who made this choice have a meaningful life. Our moments on this earth are so precious – we really chose to be here and I know that we can never forget it. This is something that will always be a part of our past and who we are. We cant replace our lives with new ones we can only make ours better.</p>
<p>Don’t treat us as damaged goods anymore. Accept us. Let it be ok for us to say something. Don’t look at us with pity. Realize we are special. We are just like you. And even more. We chose to live.</p>
<p>Of course we need to stop abuse and all this openness and acceptance by you is amazing. It wasn’t like this when I was going through it 15 years ago. I don’t think I even realized what abuse was.  This awareness will help people feel more comfortable reporting abuse and it will also help victims be stronger so that they wont also have to live with the fact that not only were they abused but they also have a secret that is eating at their hearts and making them disappear day by day further away from real life. This is so important. I don&#8217;t mean to put this down at all.  But we also need to be accepting so that we can tell everyone who is thinking about choosing to end their life that they should choose to live and that if they live it will be okay. We will not judge them but we will make it comfortable for them to be here. We will love them and accept them.</p>
<p>I know I rambled a lot and this is pretty crappy writing but I wanted to share my thoughts before I gave it a second thought. And if I read it back I might delete much of it because it is really hard for me to share my feelings. So thanks for sticking with me and reading my random thoughts.</p>
<p>I think to sum it all up my point is that those of us who have chosen to live and overcome our abuse are just like you. We don’t want to read that you won’t let your child marry one of us, we don’t want to read that the victim probably caused it to themselves, we don’t want to feel like second class citizens because of something that someone else did to us. First of all, it’s all wrong. And second of all when we do read or hear that, it makes us feel like maybe it wasn’t worth living through that hell just to suffer again from your fear of us. Give us a chance and know that if you do your life will be blessed. It will be so much more special and meaningful because of it. I promise you – mine is!</p>
<p>Thank you for taking your precious time and reading this…. It means a lot to me</p>

I paid for the book and received no compensation for this review. (Nor do I want any.)</em></p>
<p>Last week, my friend <a href="http://frumsatire.net" target="_blank">Heshy Fried</a> told me about a new book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. Curiosity piqued, I immediately purchased the book from Amazon. It was delivered to my door on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>After our Friday Night Dinner, I tucked my elder son into bed at 8:30 PM. I sat down with the book and began to read. Three hours later (and several tissues later) I completed the book. The best determination of a good read, is whether I can put the book down. I could not put down <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. If you stop reading now, just buy the book and read it yourself. (You can buy the book by clicking on this link: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>)<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0802720889" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> is a novel about an ancillary victim of sexual abuse in a chasidic community. But it&#8217;s not really a novel. The anonymous author writes that the story is based on her own story. Truthfully, the book is based on hundreds of stories and not just stories from the chasidic world. The same story, with a different backdrop can be told by many victims of abuse from almost any insular culture. This includes, inner-city communities, Catholics, Amish and Ultra-Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>The backdrop for this story is a fictional Chasidic sect in Borough Park. The fictional sect is in the style of the major Chassidic branches in the New York metropolitan area like Satmar, Ger, Vizhnitz and Skver.</p>
<p>The story is mostly told through the eyes of a nine year old girl. To me, this is the charm of the book.<span id="more-3336"></span> Victims of abuse say that their lives can become frozen at the age of the abuse. The nine year old perspective is so innocent on the one hand, so damaged on the other hand, so naive on yet another hand and disturbing on all hands.</p>
<p>There are plenty of villains in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>, there are plenty of victims too. But only a few heros. This is how it is. Sexual abuse can ravage a community, but it takes a very strong person to be a hero in the face of abuse. Strong people like that are rare and the book demonstrates this sad reality wonderfully.</p>
<p>One of the heroes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> is a chasidic newspaper publisher. To me, he represents the bloggers who have done the dirty work of exposing this harm and its perpetrators. On behalf of everyone, thank you. The publisher in this book exposes abuse at his own peril. It shouldn&#8217;t be that way. The other hero in the book is the main character&#8217;s husband whose unconditional commitment to his wife gave her the strength to prevail under extremely trying circumstances. Enough so that she felt like an Eishes Chayil, a woman of valor, as the pseudonym implies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> has a surprisingly light tone to most of the book. As it is seen through the eyes of a nine year old chasidic girl, the names and places in the book have cute and funny names that ring true to Orthodox Jews. I found myself laughing out loud many times throughout the book.</p>
<p>As to the &#8220;meat&#8221; of the plot. the community&#8217;s approach to allegations of sexual abuse are all too familiar. Insular communities all share a distrust of governmental authority and prefer to self-police. Unfortunately, there is no self-policing of abuse in the book.</p>
<p>Crying is to be expected as one reads <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>. There are moments of heartbreaking sadness and moments of emotional triumph. The book will move its reader to tears throughout the book and by the time the reader is at the climactic ending resistance to crying is futile.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> is important. It gives real life victims a voice they can relate to. The voice of the main characters of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> are familiar to any victim of abuse. In this respect, the book is relevant to victims of abuse in any community.</p>
<p>I am only somewhat familiar, not intimately familiar with the idiosyncrasies and foibles of the chasidic community. But <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> does a spectacular job of drawing you into their community. I can only assume that what is written is accurate. (I would love if a chasidic reader would read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> and get back to me about the accuracies of the depiction of the chasidic community in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>.) The worldview portrayed in the book is absolutely terrifying. Anyone that is not exactly like &#8220;you&#8221; is an enemy or at best a heathen. The self absorption and ignorance about almost everything is shocking. Characters in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> describe any custom they have as &#8220;The Torah say&#8221;, even when the Torah certainly does not say the thing they are quoting. Characters in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> subscribe to every possible superstition Jewish culture has to offer. And perhaps worst of all, every kind of prejudice about &#8220;outsiders&#8221; that I am sure outsiders can sense in their real life interactions with the community. Characters in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a> have no working knowledge of what most communities call common sense and the facts of life.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, I wonder if these characteristics of the chasidic community, real or imagined for the book, contributed the trauma of sex abuse. Is abuse so horrible that the milieu plays a negligible role? Or perhaps is the abuse exacerbated when you have been trained to think that your community is vastly superior to others in every possible way, that God prefers you over anyone else and misinformation is so prevalent that one has to wonder if it is a vast ignorance conspiracy to maintain allegiance?</p>
<p>It is a question that may not have an answer but I think it is the broader question that is raised in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>.</p>
<p>I cannot possible give a bigger endorsement for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802720889?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802720889">Hush</a>. I recommend you click one of the links on this review and buy the book immediately. Read it. Feel the pain and hurt. Share it with a friend or a spouse and hopefully slowly, together, we can slay this dragon that has been harming our community for far too long.</p>
<p>(This book is for adults. I am not recommending this book for teens. Parents, use your own discretion.)</p>
