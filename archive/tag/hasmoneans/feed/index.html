				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6615" alt="menorah-temple" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/menorah-temple-224x300.jpg" width="224" height="300" />One of the anomalies of Chanukah is that we have historical and apocryphal texts along with rabbinic texts. We have a pretty reliable idea of what life was like when the Chanukah story took place. I think the context of the story sheds light on the far reaching consequences of the Chanukah story.</p>
<p>The Seleucid-Greeks were involved in a three way civil war. They thought conquering Israel would solve their problems by giving them a port in the Mediterranean. Meanwhile Greeks were integrating into the culture of the Land of Israel. This relationship started off amicably. The Septuagint was published. Greek / Jewish relations seemed okay. The two cultures shared some impressive characteristics. They both valued wisdom and scholarship as opposed to brute force. The Rabbis even considered Greek a sub-Hebrew language in the rank of languages. There was a legal system that was older and just as comperehensive as the Greek system.</p>
<p>On one hand the Greeks would be able to find much in common with Jewish people. On the other hand, there was no “need” for the Greeks to modernize the Jews. They weren’t a savage tribe that needs laws and philosophy to teach them how to live. Greek and Jews could live together so long as there was no attempt by one or the other to assert their will above the other. Many Jews adopted Greek culture into their lives. Some went too far and became Greeks or Hellenists. Other were religious, law abiding Jews who were acculturated.</p>
<p>At the same time that this is happening, a schism is forming within Judaism. The Pharisees were the traditionalists. They believed that the Oral Tradition was Divine and binding. They were heavily representative of rabbis and members of the priestly class. A populist group also formed and they called themselves the Sadducees. They rejected the Oral Law and rabbinic authority. The Sadducees saw a natural ally in the Greeks and the Hellenized Jews. They recruited the Greeks and Hellenized Jews to their cause. They were a good fit because the Hellenists were less traditional than the Pharisees and the Sadducees rejected tradition.<span id="more-6614"></span></p>
<p>Eventually the Hellenists and Sadducees enlist the Greeks to help their cause. The Seleucid King Antiochus is happy to oblige and he begins a reign of terror over the Jewish people. He forbade celebrating Jewish holidays, Torah study, and circumcision. The Pharisaic Jews resist these laws. The hand of the Greeks comes fast and heavy.</p>
<p>First there were passive rebels. They ignored the decrees and were mercilessly slaughtered. A war was not ideal because it would kill Hellenist Jews as well as Greek intruders. But in the end there was no choice. The Hasmoneans led a spirited rebellion and after 25 years of war eventually vanquished the Greeks. After just 3 years of fighting, Jerusalem is reconquered and the Hasmoneans rededicated the Temple and in a great symbolic and moral victory they lit the Menorah. The next year they instituted an eight day celebration that we are in the midst of celebrating right now.</p>
<p>This is the start of the Hasmonean dynasty. It lasts 103 years and ends tragically with zero Jews remaining from their line. Worse, another civil war that could be blamed on the Hasmoneans invites the Romans into Israel and eventually the Romans destroy the Temple and exile the Jewish people in one of the most horrific genocides in our history.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years later, the Talmud wants to distract us from the military victory because of the corruption it caused. The rabbis frowned upon the Hasmoneans. They focus on the miracle of the oil. The heretofore-unmentioned miracle of the oil. It is not mentioned in Maccabees or Josephus. The Braisa in Shabbos tells us about the miracle for the first time. Clearly, the rabbis of the Talmud were distracting the attention of the holiday from the victory of the war to the miracle of the oil.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>There can be many answers to this question. I propose the following possibility. Maybe the rabbis shifted the focus to the oil to remind us that the Hasmoneans were not exemplars of what the Torah really wants from us.</p>
<p>The Ramban says that the Hasmoneans were doomed because they usurped the Jewish monarchy and were also the Priests. They had all the power and the honor. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. But what was their fatal flaw? Why did they mess up so badly? Why didn&#8217;t they restore the Davidic monarchy? Why did they insist on keeping all the power?</p>
<p>I believe their flaw was a failure to properly adjust to modernity. They rejected everything Greek. They sought to completely remove the Greek influence from Israel. This exacerbated the rift between them and the Saducees and Hellenists. This caused those groups to enlist the Greeks. This caused a war. The Hasmonean led Pharisees were unyielding. They would not rest until their brethren completely rejected anything but their stringent beliefs. But the irony is that their fundamentalism worked for a little while. They did liberate the Temple. They did restore Jewish sovereignty to Israel.</p>
<p>But their ultimate downfall was because of a failure to address modernity. They had no approach to Greek culture. It was all or nothing. This was a recipe for short-lived success but eventual disaster. In the end the Hasmoneans were only able to reject or fully embrace the Greek culture. The Hasmoneans wound up as assimilated as one can possibly be. They had no approach to deal with modernity and they failed it.</p>
<p>The rabbis of the Talmud <em>did</em> have an approach to deal with modernity. They were Torah scholars but were well versed in the science and philosophy of their day. The rabbis were not &#8220;all or nothing&#8221;. The rabbis of the Talmud were willing to explore the wisdom that came from outside the Torah. The rabbis wanted us to realize the mistake of the Hasmoneans and focused on the oil, which was not really as important as the victory in the war. But the oil story has staying power. As we are taught, the Menorah in the Temple had 7 lamps and the three lamps on either side represented the wisdom of the world turning toward the center of Torah. That lesson is a lesson taught by the rabbis of the Talmud. The Hasmoneans could not relate to that idea.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, the oil teaches us another thing. Fire is the fusion of spiritual and physical. It is physical but it is used to symbolize the spiritual. We light candles for the souls of our loved ones. Fire is a nexus between the physical and spiritual worlds. The miracle of the oil part of the story makes Chanukah about the using of military might and newfound autonomy for service of God. We are being told that the Hasmonean way is not to revered or emulated. The fire and oil remind us to integrate the world with Torah. This was a message the rabbis could endorse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/shamash_drip.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4975" title="shamash_drip" alt="" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/shamash_drip-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>Separation of Church and State is widely regarded as a modern concept. For most of the world this is an accurate assessment. In some places in the world there remains no separation. What I mean by a separation between church and state is that quite simply there are two different and exclusive bodies that legislate religion and politics. Political leadership is vested in one person or group and religious considerations are seen to by a different person or group.</p>
<p>In the United States, I believe separation of church and state is a misnomer. It&#8217;s not that there is a separation as much as the state has no opinion on religion. I think that a truer version of a separation between church and state originated with ancient Judaism.</p>
<p>The law was that the political leadership of the Jewish people flowed through the Davidic family of the tribe of Judah. The religious leaders in ancient Israel were the priests and the Levites who were are members of the tribe of Levi. These two groups were separate. This separation of powers was to ensure that no group had absolute power. It created a balance between political and domestic interests and religious interests. It was a good system and I believe the model for today&#8217;s separation.<span id="more-4974"></span></p>
<p>The story of Chanukah tells the tale of the Hasmonean family rebelling against the oppressive Seleucid-Greeks. This family was a priestly family. They sough to restore honor and holiness to the Temple. They also sought political autonomy from the Seleucid-Greeks.</p>
<p>They won both.</p>
<p>At that moment that they won they should have appointed a Davidic heir to the throne. But they failed to do so. A Hasmonean was anointed king and this began a slow fall from grace for the Hasmoneans. Not one Hasmonean remained after several generations of intermarriage and intra-violence. The Rabbis of the Talmudic era cite their error in taking the throne as the reason for their ultimate colossal failure.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Hasmoneans did not separate church and state. They were the kings and the priests at the same time and carried absolute power. As time has proven time and time again, absolute power corrupts absolutely. The Hasmoneans ended up in the scrap heap of history because of their failure in this regard.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of candles on our Chanukah menorah. There are the candles that we light each light. On the first night we light one and the second night we light two and we continue adding candles for eight night. By lighting these candles we fulfill a religious obligation to light these candles as instituted by the great rabbis of the Mishnah. We light candles and create holiness.</p>
<p>However there is another candle. The shamash is the candle we use to light the nightly candles. It does not factor into the religious nightly lighting. It is a functional candle, not a holy candle. It is a candle whose name, shamash can mean &#8220;caretaker&#8221;. The shamash is the lighter. But it is not the candle of the mitzvah.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the requirement that we use a shamash was a wink from the rabbis of the Mishnah reminding us why the Hasmoneans were such a disaster. They did not separate the political from the religious. The functional and holy were too closely intertwined. The political leaders were from the same family as the religious leaders.</p>
<p>Chanukah remembers their initial success but the lighting of the Chanukah candles reminds us of their ultimate failure. They did not separate church and state. On our Chanukah menorah we do separate church and state. We light holy candles to do a mitzvah. We light those candles with a separate, purely functional candle.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not quite sure how to relate this idea to contemporary Chanukah celebrations and the current state of Jewish affairs. But I am pretty sure there is a message in there that reminds us that sometimes we and our leaders need to hear alternative voices. That a <em>kinas sofrim</em> among Jews is a good thing and helps us fine tune our personal observance. There cannot be just one way, with one leadership, with one set of ideas. There must be multiple voices. There can&#8217;t be absolute power because is absolutely corrupts. Just ask as the shamash.</p>
