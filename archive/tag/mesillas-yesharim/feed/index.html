				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/200573745-001.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2804" title="200573745-001" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/200573745-001.jpg?resize=200%2C240" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>As we approach the Jewish New Year there is an effort  to at least attempt to enter Rosh Hashanah clean from sin. Unfortunately, we have made bad choices, we have done wrong in our lives. How are we to start a fresh year with joy and confidence if we are carrying all the baggage of mistakes we have made. It can be depressing thinking about bad choices we have made. They all have consequences and we may regret what we have done. But regret does not fix the harms we have caused. Regret can have a debilitating effect if it holds us back from achieving our goals as we wallow in self pity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a concept of Teshuva, repentance, in Judaism. The word repentance generally refers to a person to has decided to commit their life to God (see Wikipedia on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentance" target="_blank">repentance</a>). But what of someone who already has committed their life to God and is trying to do their best to make the best moral choices in their life but has made mistakes? Is there a mechanism for that person to somehow come back to God? Aren&#8217;t they already committed to God? What more can they do?</p>
<p>In Judaism there is such a mechanism. <span id="more-2801"></span>That is what we call Teshuva. Anyone can do teshuva and everyone should be doing teshuva all the time. Any time we make the wrong choice we have created separation between ourselves and God who is Perfection. Our lack of perfection stands in the way of being with God and Perfection. The further we are from perfection, the further we are from God. Teshuva gets us closer to perfection.</p>
<p>But how? Once we have acted and done wrong the deed is done. Can teshuva make it disappear? Is it magic?</p>
<p>Compounding the problem is the idea that God is the Ultimate Judge. That means that if an act is &#8220;bad&#8221; it deserves immediate consequences. There is no judge, no jury, no lawyers, no plea bargain deals, Ultimate Judgment means that every act has an exact and precise Divine Reaction. That is how the physical world works as well. If ones steals something, the item is stolen immediately. There is no grace period or gray area. If one kills someone, the person is dead. If one cheats on their wife, they have cheated. In the physical world, our actions have immediate, real reactions. That is what is meant by &#8220;judgment&#8221; (poor translation of the hebrew word din). There is an immediate reaction to our actions from God as well. The distance created by our lack of perfection is instantaneous. How do we repent from acts that are done? If someone is dead because of our action, no amount of sorrow or regret will bring the person back. Same with infidelity. How can teshuva fix the immediate reactions of our actions?</p>
<p>This leaves us with an additional question: While it is true that God acts with judgment, God also acts with mercy (rachamim) how does mercy reconcile with judgment if judgment means that every action has an immediate physical and spiritual reaction?</p>
<p>The Ramchal in Mesillas Yesharim provides a wonderful explanation. First, he explains that the mercy of God is that while every action does have an immediate spiritual consequence, that consequence can be suspended for a period of time giving the person time to repent.</p>
<p>But what of the repentance? How does that work? He says that every action really has two parts. The first part is the formation of intent. The idea and the desire to act are the first part of every action. Then we act; that is the second part. The action causes the immediate result. Physical and spiritual. Each action is &#8220;owned&#8221; by its actor. So when one makes a wrong choice the act is connected to them. The action is the end of a chain that hooks up to the actor. The hook on the end of the chain that is connected to the actor is the desire for the result. So a flow chart would look like this:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Actor&#8212;-&gt;Desire&#8212;-&gt;Action&#8212;-&gt;Result.</h3>
<p>The result is only connected to the actor through the desire. Teshuva is the process of &#8220;undoing&#8221; the desire for the action and its result. True repentance occurs when the actor wishes with all their heart that they had never acted the way they did. When the person truly regrets their choice the desire part of the action can be unhooked from the actor! If there is no hook connectig the action to the actor (the desire) then the actor and the action are no longer associated with one another. That is teshuva. Repentance is disassociating the action from the actor by removing the desire to act. Of course, in order for the desire to be disassociated from the actor the actor must everything in their power to fix the horrible results of their action. But once that is done, repentance can be achieved and the action can be clipped away from the actor.</p>
<p>Certainly, the deed is done. What&#8217;s done is done. We cannot change the past. But we can change our association with the past.</p>
<p>This kind of repentance leaves no room for baggage and guilt. It is a clean break from the past and allows us to move forward to a future of better choices.</p>
<p>It is the perfect way to begin a new year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a wonderful<a href="http://www.ou.org/chagim/roshchodesh/default.htm" target="_blank"> Rosh Chodesh</a> morning services we began our weekly foray into the depths of Ramchal&#8217;s Mesillas Yesharim.</p>
<p>Last week we began to learn about the detriment of scoffing or sarcasm to out spiritual growth. The general principle is that one who is incapable of seriousness about life will not be able grow spiritually. This week I had planned on completing Chapter 5 in its entirety.</p>
<p>However, we got no further in the text of Mesillas Yesharim this week.</p>
<p>Instead we had a truly invigorating discussion ab0ut &#8220;seriousness&#8221;. It is tough for us to relate to this section Mesilas Yesharim. We are allowed to make jokes, frivoility is not ALWAYS bad, so how can we bring this section down to earth and make is relevant?</p>
<p>One example that I cited for a moment as we began class was the way observant Jews typically dress. Have you ever wondered why observant Jews dress conservatively for the most part or wear &#8220;black and white&#8221;?</p>
<p>Much of what we talk about was related to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/" target="_blank">this post</a>, as well as these <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/13/clothes-in-the-nba/" target="_blank">posts</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/05/clothing-round-up/" target="_blank">this post</a> as well.</p>

<p>Click to listen to our discussion. It was very interesting and enlightening.<span id="more-704"></span></p>
<p>Enjoy the class (29 minutes)</p>

		<itunes:summary>After a wonderful&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ou.org/chagim/roshchodesh/default.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Rosh Chodesh&lt;/a&gt; morning services we began our weekly foray into the depths of Ramchal&#039;s Mesillas Yesharim.

Last week we began to learn about the detriment of scoffing or sarcasm to out spiritual growth. The general principle is that one who is incapable of seriousness about life will not be able grow spiritually. This week I had planned on completing Chapter 5 in its entirety.

However, we got no further in the text of Mesillas Yesharim this week.

Instead we had a truly invigorating discussion ab0ut &quot;seriousness&quot;. It is tough for us to relate to this section Mesilas Yesharim. We are allowed to make jokes, frivoility is not ALWAYS bad, so how can we bring this section down to earth and make is relevant?

One example that I cited for a moment as we began class was the way observant Jews typically dress. Have you ever wondered why observant Jews dress conservatively for the most part or wear &quot;black and white&quot;?

Much of what we talk about was related to &lt;a href=&quot;http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, as well as these &lt;a href=&quot;http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/13/clothes-in-the-nba/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/05/clothing-round-up/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; as well.

You can also subscribe to all classes in &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/pacific-jewish-center-rabbi/id546393368&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/pacific-jewish-center-rabbi/id546393368&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/health/05mind.html?scp=1&amp;sq=stumbling&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">very interesting column</a> in the New York Times today.</p>
<p>The column presents some evidence that a large chasm exists between what an individual will claim they would do in a given situation and what one would actually do in that given situation.</p>
<p>In other words our actions betray our feelings of righteousness. (How funny is it that the columnist&#8217;s named is Benedict? well, it made me smile&#8230;).</p>
<p>As I was reading the article, which I highly recommend I kept thinking: Why is this idea so natural to me? Where else have I seen this?</p>
<p>The answer was really obvious.</p>
<p><span id="more-548"></span>The article talks about the &#8220;holier-than-thou&#8221; effect. People overstimate how they would behave if they were in a specific situation. For example, most of us probably think that we never take steroids if we were athletes, or that if we were investment bankers we never would have inflated the market for personal gain, or any other time you have been morally horrified.</p>
<p>The truth is, that most of us would have made the same decisions. How do we know? By setting people up.</p>
<p>Like 83% of college student at Cornell believed they would buy a flower to benefit cancer research and that only 56% of their peers would buy a flower.</p>
<p>In reality only 43% actually bought flowers. That is very few.</p>
<p>The article then veers into murky waters.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>One practice that can potentially temper feelings of moral superiority is religion. All major faiths emphasize the value of being humble and the perils of hubris. “In humility count others as better than yourself,” St. Paul advises in his letter to the Philippians.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The article concludes that those who are religious have an even higher percentage of individuals who think they will outperform their peers in moral challenges.</p>
<p>Maybe the element of humility is not the key to avoiding &#8220;holier-than-thou&#8221; effect.</p>
<p>In Judaism we have a basic precept to avoid this problem.</p>
<p>One who sees someone sin <em>must</em> concoct an excuse or rationale for the wrongful behavior they witnessed. We are not permitted to think that someone else did wrong. It is irrelevant and mostly harmful to ourselves. There is a couple of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Other-Side-Story-Strategies-Artscroll/dp/0899065201" target="_blank">great</a><a href="http://www.judaicaplace.com/result.html" target="_blank"> books</a> that train us how to do this. You learn how to judge others favorably.</p>
<p>Further, we also have the following rule. <em>&#8220;Do not judge your friend until you stand in his place&#8221;.</em> This is exactly how to avoid &#8220;holier-than-thou&#8221; syndrome. Don&#8217;t think about it. You are incapable of making a moral judgment as an outsider. Until you are in the exact same situation you cannot possibly assess whether the other person made a good or bad judgment. In truth, you will never stand in his place. You will never know what his state of mind or affairs was. Nor do any two people have the same challenges.<em>&#8220;Do not judge your friend until you stand in his place&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Finally, we have another rule to avoid the &#8220;holier-than-thou&#8221; effect. <em>&#8220;Do not trust yourself to avoid sin until the day you die&#8221;.</em> We must be vigilant until our final moments because we can always fall. When you are aware that you are susceptible to failure, you are more likely to stay off the high horse. It also shortens the gap between those who are good and those who they think may not yet be so good. You can fall at any time. Don&#8217;t get &#8220;holier-than-thou&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now it all makes sense. The columnist helped me review these rules by showing how without these rules society runs a huge risk. It makes me more thankful to have been taught these ideas and now I am sharing them with you.</p>
<p>Live by these rules and I guarantee you will find more things to smile about, more things to brighten your day and more way to bring happiness to others.</p>
