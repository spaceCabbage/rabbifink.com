				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach was interviewed by <a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2014/09/ultra-orthodox-jews-have-better-sex.html" target="_blank">New York Magazine</a> about his new book “Kosher Lust.” He drops a bombshell right off the bat:</p>
<p><em>Among us religious Jews, sex is a big deal. It’s a religious obligation. In Jewish law, a man has to make his wife orgasm before he does.</em></p>
<p>The interviewer is skeptical. <em>Really?</em></p>
<p>The Rabbi insists. <em>It’s in the Talmud.</em></p>
<p>This week, Rabbi Shmuley cited the interview <a href="http://shmuley.com/2014/10/20/kosher-and-non-kosher-voyeurism/" target="_blank">in an article</a> that weirdly places the blame for Rabbi Freundel’s voyeurism on his wife. Or something like that. Here’s how he restated his position:</p>
<p><em>The rule applies even more to women. I was amazed last week that an orthodox Jewish sex counselor attacked me for an interview I gave on my new book “Kosher Lust” to New York Magazine, reprinted in Britain’s Daily Mail, that said that Jewish law encourages a man to make his wife climax first. This is Judaism’s tacit acknowledgment of a fact that modern science has finally caught up with – that women are much more sexual than men, having more deeply-rooted sexual needs.</em></p>
<p>This passage presents a softer version of the New York Magazine bombshell. It’s no longer a religious obligation for the man to make his wife orgasm before he does &#8211; now it’s encouragement &#8211; but there is a more fundamental problem with the entire premise. It’s <em>not </em>in the Talmud.<span id="more-8910"></span></p>
<p>Undoubtably, the rabbi is referring to a selection from <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.31a" target="_blank">Tractate Niddah 31A</a>.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/22/rabbi-shmuley-thats-talmud-says/674x501_682670_548164_1346314330/" rel="attachment wp-att-8912"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8912" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/674x501_682670_548164_1346314330.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="674x501_682670_548164_1346314330" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> <em>“R. Isaac citing R. Ammi stated: If the woman emits her semen first she bears a male child; if the man emits his semen first she bears a female child; for it is said, If a woman emits semen and bear a man-child.” (Translation: Soncino)</em></p>
<p>The Soncino translation is confusing to the modern reader because women don&#8217;t emit semen.  In the original Hebrew, “emit semen” is <em>“mazra’at,”</em> which is more literally translated as “she seeds.” What does <em>mazra’at</em> mean in practical terms? And why would it affect the gender of the baby?</p>
<p>We find two general paths of interpretation in the commentaries. One is that when the female climaxes first, the child will be a boy. Thus, <em>mazra’at</em> is indeed orgasm. The other possibility is that women actually do emit a substance during intercourse and if the woman’s emission arrives first, the child will be a boy. In this version, <em>mazra’at</em> follows a more literal translation and refers to a female version of sperm.</p>
<p>It sounds completely unscientific to believe that gender is determined this way. In fact, we can demonstrate that both of the translations are absolutely false, but the Talmud and its commentators got these ideas from the science of their day. The two paths of interpretation may reflect a dispute between the Greek philosophers Aristotle, Hippocrates and Galen, who all held that female orgasm was essential to conception in some way. Aristotle believed that the woman had no seed, but the womb was inhospitable to semen before she climaxed. Hippocrates and Galen believed that friction would “heat” the woman, and a seed would be released inside her body when she climaxed. (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=f2d-11Y_u3cC&amp;lpg=PA270&amp;ots=2p77aBKHko&amp;dq=aristotle%20female%20orgasm&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Either way, the Talmud holds that in order to bear a male child, the female must climax first. The background to all of this is purely medical and obviously obsolete.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, the Talmud does not say what Rabbi Shmuley claims it says. Not even close. Rabbi Shmuley is trying to teach a lesson about sexual pleasure within a marriage based on a Talmudic statement, but <em>nowhere</em> in this statement is there an indication of preference regarding which person climaxes first. Armed with the background information, his attempt seems laughable. The Talmud is not giving sex advice. The Talmud is giving information about <em>sex selection</em>. It simply informs the reader that, scientifically speaking, the order of orgasm determines the gender of the child. That’s all. No obligations. No encouragement. None of that.  Since the information is based on a false premise, it follows that any directive would be obsolete as well.</p>
<p>There is one last twist of irony that undermines the rabbi’s broader point and betrays a troubling bias. Rabbi Shmuley paints the obligation to pleasure one’s wife before oneself as an example of Judaism’s sensitivity towards women. However, the only way one could make that inference from the text is with the assumption that male offspring are better than females. Were males truly more desirable, one could argue that when the Talmud reports how to conceive a male child, it is actually instructing the reader to do so. To me, it seems totally incongruous to make a feminist point from a Talmudic statement that is instructing couples in the fine art of producing male children.</p>
<p>In Rabbi Shmuley’s defense, it’s possible that he borrowed this teaching from a <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/23255501" target="_blank">55 year old article written by Rabbi Emanuel Rackman in Tradition</a>. He mentions this idea, citing the Talmud in Niddah 31A as part of his broader thesis in the article.  His version is softer than Rabbi Shmuley’s version, saying that the Talmud is specifically referring to practices that are <em>not</em> laws. Rather, they are natural consequences of principles that are part of the fabric of Jewish life and tradition.</p>
<p>In summary: Rabbi Shmuley waffles on whether it is an obligation or an encouragement. It’s almost certain that the entire purpose of the talmudic statement is to educate couples in gender selection techniques, and <em>not</em> in the secret to happy marriage. The Talmud is agnostic about whether he or she should climax first. That is, unless you are so patriarchal that you deduce the importance of pleasuring one’s wife first in order to have male children.</p>
<p>It’s wrong to advance one’s agenda by misquoting and misunderstanding sections from the Talmud. Fortunately, we don’t need to rely on mangled proof-texts to make Rabbi Shmuly’s point. In any good relationship, both partners are seeking ways to pleasure their counterparts. Whether it’s through intimacy, general kindness and consideration, support, helping significant others achieve personal success, or raising children together, putting the other ahead of the self is a fundamental of Judaism.</p>
<p>The Talmud (and this is actually true) says that a man has an obligation to make his wife happy (Kiddushin 34b). After all, the Torah commands us <em>“Love your neighbor like yourself.”</em> We are commanded to treat others the way we want to be treated. Seems to me, that’s reason enough to take Rabbi Shmuley’s advice. We don’t need advice that locks us into a specific formula; we use our discretion and follow the love in our hearts. A good husband already knows to put his wife first, as a good wife wishes to put her husband first.</p>
<p>Above all, a good relationship needs honesty and trust. Doling out advice based on an untruth &#8211; even decent advice &#8211; is a terrible way to teach people about relationships.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new literary project caught my eye over the last few days. Two of my friends, Leah Vincent and Sam Katz, have teamed up with Aya Rose, and are trying to publish a book called “Legends of the Talmud.”</p>
<p>People often assume that Orthodox Judaism is a religion based on the Five Books of Moses. Of course it is, in a sense, but the People of the Book actually have a different book that forms that basis of the religion. That book is the Talmud.<span id="more-8562"></span><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/06/25/talmud-everyone/4389233dbd2ba678c1294100a6b03dfc_large/" rel="attachment wp-att-8563"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/4389233dbd2ba678c1294100a6b03dfc_large.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="4389233dbd2ba678c1294100a6b03dfc_large" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8563" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The Talmud is the primary text of Orthodox Judaism. The Bible requires interpretation and Orthodox Judaism relies on the interpretations of the Talmud. Personally, I think when it’s taught the right way, Talmud can be for everyone. One can have a spiritual experience swimming in the sea of the Talmud. It should be that way for everyone and it can be that way for everyone. From a halachic perspective, experiencing Talmud discourse and participating in the process, is a valuable experience for anyone.</p>
<p>It’s not just in matters of law and ritual that the Talmud influences Orthodox Judaism, social mores, ethics, philosophy, and many other non-legal aspects of Orthodox Judaism find their source in the Talmud as well. Perhaps above all, story telling is the hallmark of the non-legal sections of the Talmud. Rabbis and political figures, Biblical characters, and legendary heroes come to life on the pages of the Talmud through the stories told about these figures.</p>
<p>“Legends of the Talmud” seeks to bring some of these stories to a modern, younger audience that is thirsty for stories with ancient and religious themes. The “Myths, Folktales, and Fairy Tales” genre for children lacks authentic Jewish content. Artscroll somewhat fills the need for Orthodox children, but not all their publications are accessible and acceptable to the non-Orthodox. “Legends of the Talmud” might be able to fill that niche.</p>
<p>Many Orthodox Jews are probably wondering why non-Orthodox Jews would write a book like this and why they would read a book like this. There is a movement, especially in Israel, for non-Orthodox Jews to study Talmud seriously. MK Ruth Calderon, famously champions this idea. I have my own theories and ideas about the interest that non-Orthodox Jews take in the Talmud, but I was fortunate to have some time to talk with Sam Katz about these issues and more.</p>
<p>Sam is one of those people who is very passionate about Talmud. In his own words, “nothing compares to the Talmud. It’s moiradik!” He cited Carl Sagan’s famous retort when he was asked why he made The Cosmos to bring science to the public. Sagan said “when you’re in love, you want to tell the world.” Sam is in love with the Talmud and it comes through when talking about the Talmud with him. In one sense, that answers the question. If you love Talmud, you want to share it. Observance is unrelated to enjoying Talmud study.</p>
<p>For Sam, the journey of writing this book fixed some of the flaws of his yeshiva education. Something I experienced at Ner Israel and Yeshiva of Far Rockaway, was the willingness to take Aggada seriously and analyze the various opinions of certain rabbis in the context of other things they taught. Sam reported that this was taboo in the yeshiva he attended and he thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of working on this book.</p>
<p>One of the stories in the book is a conversation between Rabbi Yose and a Roman Matron. She asked him what God has been busy doing eve since the creation of the world. Rabbi Yose answered that God is playing matchmaker. The book offers no commentary on this story or any other of the stories in the book. I wondered what this story could mean to someone who didn’t actually believe that God was making shidduchim in Heaven. Sam told me what this story meant to him. Children often assume that marriage is easy and natural. They see their parents as a unit that only exists as a unit. They don’t imagine there is any way things could be different and children often struggle with understanding how their parents could have trouble getting along. Separation and divorce often baffle children. Children don’t appreciate the nuances and challenges of relationships, especially marriage. In Sam’s view, the Talmud is teaching us a lesson about marriage. It’s not easy. It’s not simple. God Himself is working on marriages because it is so important and so difficult.</p>
<p>Overall, the book has been an amazing experience for Sam. He was a Talmudphile when he was in yeshiva, and this has reignited his love for Talmud. Sam wants everyone to share in this wisdom and feel the warmth of the Talmud’s fire. But even more profoundly, the Talmud is our collective history and culture encapsulated in words. We all share the Talmud and by bringing it to non-Orthodox children through this book, Sam hopes to build a bridge that can create common language between Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews. The stakes are even greater when families have Orthodox and non-Orthodox siblings and cousins who might be able to relate to each other through this book and others like it.</p>
<p>I wondered if Sam thought this book would appeal to a Orthodox audience and whether the more insular communities would allow this book in their homes and libraries. He felt that the translations should be perfectly acceptable but the illustrations might irk some people. I wish it could have been done in a way that works for everyone but I understand that it can be impossible to satisfy all needs. At the very least, as Sam reiterated, the book can open the doors of the Talmud to a new audience. Hopefully, will become part of the Jewish vocabulary of non-Orthodox Jew and inspire them to seek more of the Talmud’s wisdom.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the more interesting ways to frame the question of Orthodox Jewish women wearing tefillin is in the context of yesterday&#8217;s post. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/02/24/life-is-in-its-struggles-dealing-with-the-tough-questions/">Life is in its Struggles: Dealing With the Tough Questions</a>)</p>
<p>Many of the statements made about women in the Talmud that sound offensive to us relate to women studying Torah. The objections to women learning Torah are mostly an issue of cognition or intellectual prowess. Regardless, the accepted unequivocal conclusion of the Talmud is that women should not study Torah.<span id="more-8160"></span></p>
<p>The parameters of this prohibition are not as broad as the Talmud seems to imply. The most restrictive opinions in the achronim say they may only learn the laws that are relevant to their practice. The Rambam says they are only prohibited from studying the Oral Law but he seems to hinge it upon their overall academic abilities which are fluid and subjective. The Chida famously said that if a woman wants to learn she can learn whatever she wants.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/two-tracks-converging.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8161" alt="two-tracks-converging" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/two-tracks-converging.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The point is that the very harsh statements of the Talmud regarding teaching women Torah has been narrowly tailored even according to the least permissive opinion. No one reads the halachic part of this rabbinic ban on Torah study for women without some form liberal interpretation.</p>
<p>When we contrast this with the statements of the Talmud regarding women wearing tefillin we see the opposite process. The Mishna simply says that women are exempt from tefillin. The Talmud never says explicitly that women should not wear tefillin. The Sefer HaChinuch discusses whether women would make the blessing on tefillin without saying that it is prohibited. We don&#8217;t know if women actually did wear tefillin but from a Talmudic perspective, they would have been allowed to wear tefillin.</p>
<p>Instead, the Rama is the one who makes the liberal statement of the Talmud more restrictive than it&#8217;s simple reading. The Rama says that women are exempt from tefillin but they should be strongly discouraged from wearing them. As an aside, I think it is reasonable that the Rama&#8217;s citation that <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.88" target="_blank">women should not touch Torah scrolls</a> is relevant and might have influenced his tefillin position. Something to think about.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2014 and it&#8217;s not just that they should be discouraged, it&#8217;s that it&#8217;s prohibited altogether. It&#8217;s even been said that women wearing tefillin today is a form of sectarianism. This is so far from the position stated in the Mishnah that it has to make us wonder how this happened.</p>
<p>I think it is worth noticing that these two trains are going in opposite directions on two different sets of tracks. I can&#8217;t explain or account for these very different story lines with any degree of certainty but I do have a guess. It could be that in the view of the poskim along the way, the leniencies regarding studying Torah are a &#8220;necessary evil&#8221; but are not ideal at all. It was just impossible to tell girls that they cannot study Torah in modern society. Plus there is the Chida. There is no such necessity for tefillin and there is no Chida (although there is the Chinuch and Michal bas Shaul).</p>
<p>That does not account for the increasingly stringent views on tefillin. That might just be the same as any other increasingly stringent halachic development. The combination of necessary and precedent might explain the reason for increasingly liberal positions on Torah study for women. It might also provide the blueprint for adjustments to our views on women wearing tefillin and other similar issues. Time will tell.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s understandable that Orthodox Judaism is reluctant to endorse academic approaches to Torah. The basic assumptions of Orthodox Judaism are in direct opposition to the basic assumptions of academic research. We believe God gave the Torah. We believe the Oral Law is the interpretation of the written Torah and it is equally binding. Academics assume none of that. The entire purpose of academic research is to approach the texts with zero assumptions and arrive where the pure analysis leads. Often these two approaches will lead to opposite results and this is not acceptable in Orthodox Judaism. We can&#8217;t be undermining our own religion.</p>
<p>I think there is an exception to this policy. The exception is Chanukah. No one thinks Chanukah is Divine. No one thinks that God commanded us to celebrate Chanukah. Everyone knows that the holiday was instituted by the Maccabees and was subsequently established by Megilas Taanis and then by the rabbis of the Babylonian Talmud as a holiday to be celebrated every year. So the worst thing that could happen if we follow the academic path is that we might find inconsistencies in the story or in the reasons for the rabbinic commandments of the holiday. But because we already assume it is not Divine, the potential harm from merging our traditional understanding with the academic view is minimal.<span id="more-7866"></span><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IRHT_126277-p.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7868" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IRHT_126277-p.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="IRHT_126277-p" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>At most, we might discover that the version of the story according to the Talmud is not the only version of the story. What&#8217;s the harm in that? We are required to keep the holiday because of their power of Beis Din HaGadol, not because what they said is objectively factually true. If it turns out that they had one understanding of the story that is not corroborated by the historical evidence it wouldn&#8217;t make an ounce of a difference to us. We would still have to keep the holiday as commanded by the rabbis of the Talmud. If you disagree, stop reading.</p>
<p>With the preamble out of the way, I think it&#8217;s safe to dive right in.</p>
<p>The Chanukah story occurred between 167 BCE and 165 BCE. We have two apocryphal books describing the events of the Chanukah story. 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees were written within 50 years of the revolt. Megilas Taanis was written a century later, followed shortly thereafter by Josephus&#8217;s Antiquities. In all four of these texts we are told about the Chanukah story and the establishment of a yearly celebration.</p>
<p>In 1 Maccabees we are told that the celebration was for the restoration of the daily sacrifices in the Temple and the general rededication of the sanctuary. Hence the name Chanukah; a celebration of the dedication, as <span style="font-size: medium;">חנך</span> means to dedicate. 2 Maccabees echoes the same sentiments and adds that the first Chanukah celebration was a reflection of the Sukkos celebration of 8 days that they had been unable to celebrate a few months earlier because of the war.</p>
<p>Megilas Taanis simply proclaims the 25th of Kislev a holiday and it is forbidden to mourn for 8 days. The text does not give a reason for the celebration. Josephus slightly editorializes the version of 1 Maccabees in his work. But he adds the first reference we find to the idea of lights being associated with the Holiday:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days, [&#8230;] they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of the restoration of their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was, because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The Babylonian Talmud famously asks &#8220;What is Chanukah?&#8221; The response is the quote from Megilas Taanis followed by an unsourced version of the Chanukah story that is familiar to Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;for when the Greeks entered the Temple, they polluted all the oils in the Temple, and when the Hasmonean dynasty overcame and defeated them, they checked and they found but one cruse of oil that was set in place with the seal of the High Priest, but there was in only [enough] to light a single day. A miracle was done with it, and they lit from it for eight days. The following year [the Sages] fix those [days], making them holidays for praise and thanksgiving.”</em> (Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 21A, Translation from Sefaria.org)</p>
<p>This may or may not have also been the version of the story according to the scholia (commentary) of Megilas Taanis. The original scholia was likely written between the writing of Megilas Taanis and the Talmud. A hybrid of two fairly early versions of the scholia seems to have the same story. It&#8217;s quoted by the Ohr Zarua (1260) in this manner. However, the foremost expert on the scholium is convinced (and for good reason) that the original commentary on Megilas Taanis does not contain the same version as the Talmud. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_HUCA73_Noam_v07.pdf" target="_blank">Vered Noam</a>) From what I have seen, it seems that this expert is correct.</p>
<p>So what we have is a very clear summary of the various explanations for the celebration of Chanukah. The most popular version is probably the Talmud&#8217;s explanation. Everyone &#8220;knows&#8221; that the small jug of oil was only supposed to last for one day and miraculously lasted for eight days. The popular English name for Chanukah is not &#8220;Dedication&#8221; rather it&#8217;s the Festival of Lights. Let&#8217;s assume the miracle occurred. It was not latched onto as a reason for celebration by the Maccabees. Nor was it a popular reason for the celebration at the time of Josephus. Although it&#8217;s safe to assume that candles were lit as part of the celebration of the holiday at the time of the Mishnah (and Josephus) as the Mishnah in Bava Kamma exempts someone from paying damages if a fire was started by outdoor Chanukah candles. Obviously, people lit candles and one was permitted to leave these lights outside the home on Chanukah. Further, as noted above, Josephus called the Chanukah the &#8220;Festival of Lights.&#8221; Still, there was no particular importance attached to this miracle until the rabbis of the Talmud.</p>
<p>I have a few thoughts on all this plus one thought that I choose to keep to myself for now.</p>
<p>First, 1 Maccabees follows the pattern of the Purim story. God is hidden throughout the story. There is no mention of God in the narrative. Heaven is used as a euphemism for God, but even then, God plays no active role. This is what we would expect from a story that took place after the Purim story. God&#8217;s name is omitted from Megilas Esther because God is hidden from them. Purim reinforces the concept of a hidden God pulling the strings from &#8220;afar&#8221; and arranging events to meet a specific end. It was always strange to me that Chanukah seems to revert to the pre-Purim sort of special event with an overt miracle. Further, what&#8217;s the point of this miracle? It was completely unnecessary and completely besides the point of the story. So it makes sense that a miracle would not be the focus of their narrative. The book was written like the Purim story with a focus on the man-made events with God&#8217;s tacit approval. Perhaps the sources up to the Talmud were following this pattern.</p>
<p>Second, there is a lot of speculation about why the laws of Chanukah were omitted from the Mishnah by R&#8217; Yehuda HaNasi. Whatever the reason, it was omitted. R&#8217; Yehuda HaNasi needed a <em>&#8220;heter&#8221;</em> to write down the Mishnah. His justification was that if it wouldn&#8217;t be written down, it would be forgotten. To me that means that whatever was not written down is subject to forgetfulness. Yes, there are those who try to say that the reason it was not written down was because it was so widely known, but I don&#8217;t think that fits. So it&#8217;s okay to assume that because it was not written down it might have been forgotten and the rabbis of the Talmud were using the lapse in memory to reinterpret the holiday for their own reasons. There are other examples of things being forgotten and reestablished in the Talmud. Of course, there is plenty of speculation on the reason the rabbis of the Talmud may have wanted to refocus the holiday on a God-made miracle as opposed to a Hasmonean military victory, and I have written some of my thoughts on that issue here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/12/the-chanukah-story-a-cautionary-tale-of-extremism-gone-wrong/" target="_blank">Chanukah 2012</a>. But most importantly, it seems that just about everyone who celebrates Chanukah, including non-Orthodox Jews, go with the Talmudic version of the story. That&#8217;s no small victory for the rabbis of the Talmud.</p>
<p>Third, the rabbis may have been tapping into something else in the rabbinic tradition. That is, the Talmud in Avodah Zara expanding on an idea found in Pirkei d&#8217;Rabbi Elazar states that Adam lit candles on the 25th of Kislev as it coincided with the Winter Solstice. Adam was banished from the Garden of Eden in the fall and watched as the nights grew longer and longer each coming day. He feared that that the pattern would continue until the sun would be completely hidden from earth. On the Winter Solstice he discovered that he was mistaken and the light would return so he lit candles. Lighting candles seems to be something so basic to this time of year that it makes sense that it would have become the focus of the Chanukah celebration. Even the biggest non-Jewish holiday of the year takes place this time of year and would seem to have nothing to do with lights. Yet, trees are lit up across the world. Lights are inescapable this time of year and it seems that the rabbis of the Talmud leveraged this for the benefit of Chanukah.</p>
<p>Regardless of the pre-Talmudic reasons given for the holiday, Orthodox Jews make the blessings on the candles because the rabbis of the Talmud had the authority to establish this holiday based on Megilas Taanis. Nothing that has been discussed here jeopardizes anything of significance. And so, we get to enjoy the academic study of the origins of Chanukah risk free.</p>
<p>When we light our candles this year we will be connecting ourselves to a chain of generations who lit candles, sometimes under extreme duress, to celebrate Chanukah. Let us hope that the fire of the Chanukah candles inspires us to light up the night of our exile and vanquish the negative forces in our personal temples of spirituality as they were vanquished from our public Temple 2200 years ago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The biggest challenge we have on Tisha B&#8217;Av is relating to its sadness. Our Judaism is so upbeat and so positive that it can be hard to find the inner strength to be sad on this day. We are more Slabodka than Navardhok. We are more Chasidishe than Litvishe. We are more Mesillas Yesharim than Shaarei Teshuva.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s contemporary Judaism. Asceticism is out. Joyful service is in. Eating is the new fasting.</p>
<p>As such, it can be difficult to muster the requisite sadness and appropriate mood for Tisha B&#8217;Av. I struggle with this every year and I know many others who do as well.</p>
<p>Since the time around last Tisha B&#8217;Av I have been stuyding and teaching Daf Yomi. I think that the daily Talmudic study may have a secret that can inform our Tisha B&#8217;Av experience this year.<span id="more-7384"></span></p>
<p>One of the beautiful things about studying Talmud is appreciating the way the text immerses you in the conversation. The reader is not a passive bystander. The reader is an active participant in the discussion. Sometime we are the Tanna Kamma. Then we are the voice of the Gemara that challenges that Tanna. Then we become the the various Amoraim who answer these challenges. All along the way we take on the persona and logical faculties of the speaker in the text. One second you&#8217;re R&#8217; Yehoshua, the next second you&#8217;re R&#8217; Elazar, the next minute you are Abaye, and immediately thereafter you are Rava. We read their words and we strive to understand their thinking.</p>
<p>I find this exhilarating. Every other book I have read or studied tells you what to think. The Talmud asks you to join along in thinking with it.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7385" alt="Religious Jews Mark The Anniversary Of The Destruction Of The Temple Of Solomon" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6c3d94e69c3621fb25789283f4103745.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This Tisha B&#8217;Av we can try to do the same thing with the Tisha B&#8217;Av liturgy. We hear the haunting intonations of Eicha. Instead of trying to feel pain that is so fleeting for us today, let&#8217;s try to empathize with the pain of Jeremiah. His pain leaps off the page. Can we hear the agony in his words? Can we step into his shoes and experience his torment?</p>
<p>We can do the same thing we read the Kinos. They are obscure and arcane. But they can also give us a window into the hearts and minds of their composers. When we read the poetic dirges written centuries ago we must transport ourselves to that day in history. We must try to feel what they are feeling when they wrote these searing laments. We may not be able to feel our own pain, but we can all empathize with our ancestors and feel their pain.</p>
<p>I propose that we treat the Tisha B&#8217;Av liturgy the way we treat the Talmud. We read the lines of the Talmud and we put ourselves in the place of their speaker. We can do the same thing on Tisha B&#8217;Av. We can become Jeremiah, we can become HaKalir, we can live Eicha and the Kinos vicariously.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we feel their pain, it will awaken the dormant pain in our hearts this Tisha B&#8217;Av. And maybe if we awaken that latent pain found deep in the recesses our soul, we will merit to have that pain replaced with the joy of a time when Tisha B&#8217;Av is a day of celebration and no longer a day of mourning.</p>

<p>Normally the Talmud is a free flowing conversation. Each new topic that is discussed is properly headed or is a segue from a previous conversation. On Sanhedrin 43A, the Talmud abruptly ends the conversation and picks up the conversation on 43B with an unrelated topic. Some scholars have offered creative suggestions that connect the two but no interpretations are sufficiently satisfactory.</p>
<p>The mystery has been already been solved. Here are 10 incredible photos of three versions of one book of the Talmud that tell the story of this mystery and its solution. Come with me on a Talmudic journey spanning 5 centuries.<span id="more-2556"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>1. Standard Edition Talmud</strong></span></p>
<p>When you look at a typical Gemara Sanhedrin and open it to the page with 42B and 43A this is what you see. Text of the Mishna and Gemara in the center and Rashi and Tosfos on the outside of the page with Rashi near the binding and Tosfos on the edges.</p>
<div><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082923_f05a9d2e76_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7172" alt="IMG_1550" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082923_f05a9d2e76_o.jpg?resize=559%2C419" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>The thing that immediately jumps out at you is all that white space under the text of 43A. The second thing that would jump out at you if you were studying this folio is that there is no apparent connection between the end of 43A and the start of 43B. For many years this bothered Talmudic scholars.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>2. Lots of White Space</strong></span></p>
<p>Here is a clearer view of just 43A. Note all the white space</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082655_b4c5dcf1e8_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7173" alt="IMG_1549" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082655_b4c5dcf1e8_o.jpg?resize=461%2C614" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>3. The Zhitomer Talmud Has the Same Problem</strong></span></p>
<p>This problem is not just a recent one. Below is a photograph of the same folio from the Zhitomer edition of the Talmud. This edition was printed in 1859. The above photos are from the Vilna edition of the Talmud that is used today and was first printed in the 1880&#8217;s. As you can see, the Zhitomer edition suffers from the same white space and as expected has the exact same text as the Vilna edition.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523718154_901d163a05_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7169" alt="IMG_1555" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523718154_901d163a05_o.jpg?resize=461%2C614" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>4. A Closer View of the Zhitomer</strong></span></p>
<p>Here is a closer view of the end of the Zhitomer 43A.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523719376_cb9869ba70_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7165" alt="IMG_1559" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523719376_cb9869ba70_o.jpg?resize=614%2C461" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<div>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>5, 6, and 7. A Volume of the Talmud almost 500 Years Old</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Here is where it gets interesting. The first printed edition of the Talmud was printed in Venice (not California) in 1549. Incredibly, some of these editions are still in circulation. My grandfather OB&#8221;M was an avid collector of antique <em>seforim</em> and owned a copy of Sanhedrin from the Venice edition of the Talmud. (He owned several Venice volumes.) Below are 3 photos of the spine of that volume.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523707200_a051d7db2f_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7187" alt="IMG_1510" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523707200_a051d7db2f_o.jpg?resize=461%2C614" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523706940_eb6d750e38_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7186" alt="IMG_1509" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523706940_eb6d750e38_o.jpg?resize=461%2C614" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523706636_ea6620d603_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7185" alt="IMG_1507" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523706636_ea6620d603_o.jpg?resize=461%2C614" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>8. The Oldest Printed Version of Sanhedrin 43A</strong></span></p>
<p>If we turn the page to 43A we notice something incredible. No white space. If we take a closer look we will see that 9 extra lines of text are present in the Venice edition. See below.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523715588_9664faaabf_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7163" alt="IMG_1545" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523715588_9664faaabf_o.jpg?resize=461%2C614" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>9. Now You Can Actually Read It</strong></span></p>
<p>Below is a readable photo of the text and you can see the content of the missing section. This section tells of a theoretical conversation between the students of Jesus and the rabbis. The tale incriminates the rabbis as the killers of Jesus and these students. The conversation is fascinating on its own but of more interest to us right now is the resolution to the mystery of Sanhedrin 43A. This section was removed at some point between 1549 and 1859. Either printers that were censored by the church removed the text or the rabbis had it removed to protect themselves from the ire of the church. In either case, it left many generations of Talmudic scholars in the dark.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082143_4f02739c22_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7162" alt="IMG_1547" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082143_4f02739c22_o.jpg?resize=614%2C461" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>10. Jesus Was Hanged On Passover Eve According to These Rabbis</strong></span></p>
<p>Below you can clearly see some of the text: &#8220;On Erev Pesach they hanged him&#8221;, &#8220;He tricked and misled Israel&#8221;. This is not a reliable proof that the rabbis killed Jesus. It is not meant to be historical as it is an <em>aggadic</em> text. Further, I believe some of the facts of the story here are actually impossible to reconcile with each other</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082405_2ca444cc2b_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7161" alt="IMG_1548" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082405_2ca444cc2b_o.jpg?resize=614%2C461" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Mystery solved! The old editions of the Talmud tell us the story of Sanhedrin 43A. Of course, this mystery has not been solved by me, this stuff is pretty well known and available in other formats. I just think it is even more amazing to see it in action. Now you have seen the evidence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6919" alt="A-7-toward-A-8" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A-7-toward-A-8.jpg?resize=300%2C203" data-recalc-dims="1" />It&#8217;s amazing how often I can be talking with someone about Rambam and they are surprised when I tell them that it seems to me that Maimonides rejected mysticism. I am almost certain of it and I can show how it is a very nearly impossible presumption to disprove. But greater minds than mine have either doubted or rejected this claim so I try to keep an open mind.</p>
<p>There are four typical responses when people first hear that Rambam rejected mysticism:</p>
<p>1) It&#8217;s not true. They&#8217;ll quote the Brisker Rav who supposedly said that every line in the Moreh Nevuchim is based on 100 lines in the Zohar. Or the the Lubavitch view that Rambam was such a deep writer that it only appears to be &#8220;nigleh&#8221; but really it&#8217;s all nistar.</p>
<p>2) Nebach, Rambam never had a chance to learn real kabbalah because he was isolated. But if he did, he would have been a mystic for sure.</p>
<p>3) Of course Rambam held of mysticism, he just did not anything mystical in his books for some reason. [Insert reason]
<p>4) That&#8217;s cool. Tell me more.</p>
<p>I teach a Rambam class on Sunday mornings.<span id="more-6904"></span> We just learn Mishneh Torah and I provide insights based on the commentaries and my own personal experiences. From time to time, we learn a law in the text that reaffirms the rationalistic tendencies of Rambam. Here is an example.</p>
<p>מי שנידוהו בחלום אפילו ידע מי נידהו צריך עשרה בני אדם ששונין הלכות להתירו מנידויו ואם לא מצא טורח אחריהם עד פרסא לא מצא מתירים לו אפילו עשרה ששונים משנה לא מצא מתירין לו עשרה שיודעים לקרות בתורה לא מצא מתירין לו אפילו עשרה שאינן יודעין לקרות לא מצא במקומו עשרה מתירין לו אפילו שלשה.</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means if someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication. If he can&#8217;t find 10 people he should walk up to a <em>parsa</em> to find the requisite number of people.</p>
<p>From where does Rambam get this law? From the Talmud.</p>
<p>(אמר רב יוסף: נידוהו בחלום, צריך עשרה בני אדם להתיר לו.והוא דתנו הלכתא; אבל מתנו ולא תנו, לא. ואי ליכא דתנו הלכתא, אפילו מתנו ולא תנו.ואי ליכא, ליזיל וליתב אפרשת דרכים, ויהיב שלמא לבי עשרה, עד דמקלעי ליה עשרה דגמרי הלכתא. (נדרים ח א</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means that someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication, if he can&#8217;t find 1o people he should wait at the פרשת דרכים &#8211; junction &#8211; until he finds enough people.</p>
<p>The medieval commentators explain why he should go to the junction. Some say that he should greet everyone who he sees with a Shalom Aleichem and they will reply Aleichem Shalom. This will protect him from the apparent decree that has been decided against him as shown by the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>This interpretation assumes that the blessing of Aleichem Shalom actually protects someone. This is a mystical idea.</p>
<p>Rambam is uncomfortable with this idea. So either he uses a variant text (I have not seen any manuscripts with this text) or he changes the words פרשת דרכים to the word פרסא. They sound similar, but they have completely different meanings in this context. If you go with the concept found in the Talmud you are relying on mysticism to &#8220;keep you safe&#8221; until you can properly nullify the dreamy excommunication. If you go with Rambam&#8217;s version, it&#8217;s just a limitation on how far one must go to find people to nullify the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the explanation for this law in the Mishneh Torah has nothing to do with mysticism and rationalism? Sure. But the most elegant explanation is that Rambam made a conscious choice to excise this mystical idea from his book of law. Especially when you consider this example among the mountains of other similar instances.</p>
<p>All this means is that Rambam seems to have made an effort to be as rationalist as possible in the Mishneh Torah. Further conclusions are conjecture. Personally, when I see 100 signs telling me to go one direction, I figure that I should go in that direction. To me it seems that Rambam theologically rejected mysticism in every instance possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6733" alt="ancient-bow-arrow47212524193719900" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ancient-bow-arrow47212524193719900.jpeg?resize=300%2C199" data-recalc-dims="1" />In Parshas Vayechi Yaakov blesses his grandsons, Ephraim and Menasheh with a special blessing. Then Yaakov turns to Yoseph and informs him that he has given Yoseph a double portion by considering his two sons to be tribes equal to the immediate sons of Yaakov. The end of this declaration is an enigmatic phrase where Yaakov says &#8220;אֲשֶׁר לָקַחְתִּי מִיַּד הָאֱמֹרִי, בְּחַרְבִּי וּבְקַשְׁתִּי.&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;<em>&#8230;which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my <strong>sword</strong> and with my <strong>bow</strong>.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<p>The Talmud (Bava Basra 123A) asks: Did Yaakov conquer with his sword and his bow?! [&#8230;] Rather חרבי (the sword) refers to prayer and קשתי (my bow) refers to בקשה (request from God).</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah explains this statement by connecting the word חרבי to the well known verse in Psalms that is recited every day during morning prayers: <em>&#8220;The praises of God are in their throats and the dual edged sword is in their hands.&#8221;</em> The Talmud in Brachos says this alludes to prayer. The second part refers to request from God &#8211; בקשות &#8211; because it is related to prayer. The word קשתי (my bow) is not related to prayer or request, it&#8217;s just that since we say חרבי refers to prayer and קשתי sounds like בקשה we interpret it as &#8220;request&#8221; and when it says ובקשתי it means &#8220;with my בקשה&#8221;.</p>
<p><span id="more-6725"></span></p>
<p>According to this, says the Torah Temimah, the correct text in the Talmud should be unlike the way we have it in our version of the Talmud which says &#8220;קשתי זו בקשה&#8221; it should say &#8220;<strong>ב</strong>קשתי זו בקשה&#8221;. With this version of the Talmudic text the word being interpreted is בְקַשְׁתִּי which is easier to hear as בקשתי -&#8220;with my בקשה&#8221;. Saying &#8220;קשתי זו בקשה&#8221; is weak. The word קשתי has nothing to do with&#8221;requests&#8221;. However בְקַשְׁתִּי has the exact same letters as בקשתי [bakashati] &#8211; my request. Therefore it makes much more sense if the Talmud would say בקשתי זו בקשה. Unfortunately, our Talmud says קשתי זו בקשה. It seems the Torah Temimah would like to change the text of the Talmud to the proper בקשתי זו בקשה.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah then reports that he later found a manuscript that had it this way. He concludes with&#8221;Thank God, for he has led me along the path of Truth&#8221;.</p>
<p>I did a little legwork. The Vilna Shas says it the way it&#8217;s quoted in the Torah Temimah at first. That is &#8220;קשתי זו בקשה&#8221;. As the Torah Temimah noted, this is not an ideal version of the text. The Vatican Manuscript has the same text as our Talmud. That&#8217;s no help either. However, the French Bibliotheque Manuscript does say &#8220;בקשתי זו בקשה&#8221;! So we have a winner! I think the Torah Temimah is right. This should be the proper text in the Talmud.</p>
<p>It\&#8217;s amazing to see how a careful reading of the Talmud and asking the right questions can validate a discarded manuscript. Interestingly enough, there are two other examples of manuscripts vindicating a proposed textual change in the  Talmud according to the Torah Temimah just in Parshas Vayechi.</p>

The article stands on its own merit, but it has some secondary relevance that I think is worth noting.</p>
<p>There are a number of ancient Jewish synagogues that have been excavated in the Land of Israel that date back to the sixth century. That means that these synagogues were extant around the closing of the Babylonian Talmud. Today, we are very familiar with the kind of Rabbinic Judaism that was practiced by the rabbis of the Talmud and to a large extent, orthodox Judaism is a logical extension of that form of Jewish practice.</p>
<p>However, these synagogues had mosaics and the mosaics tell a story that is different than the Judaism practiced and preached in the Talmud.</p>
<p>The mosaics combine very Jewish symbols such as the Binding of Isaac, a citron and palm frond, the ark of the covenant, and other uniquely Jewish symbols with Astrology and imagery reminiscent of Greek Gods. This is very confusing.</p>
<p>The well-behaved Jews were virulently against Pagan symbols in general. Certainly, they would not be welcome in a synagogue! Yet, it seems that these people also paid homage to the holy symbols of traditional Judaism. Quite the mystery indeed.<span id="more-6182"></span></p>
<p>In the article, Walter Zanger proposes that there was a large segment of Jews who were not rabbinic Jews. They had the same ancient traditions from the Bible as rabbinic Jews but they handled the quasi-enlightenment of the Hellenistic era in a very different way. They simply superimposed neo-pagan, Greek Philosophy on top of Judaism and them Judaism back on top of that. To them it was a natural progression from religious cult to enlightened post-Biblical culture. They cared passionately about Judaism, but it was just a different kind of Judaism. Zanger calls it &#8220;vertical&#8221;. That&#8217;s because the religion evolved from what we see in the Bible to what we see in the later prophets, to what we see in the non-Pharisee groups of Judaism, culminating with the practices present in these synagogues. One progresses from one to the next. Whereas, Pharisaic Judaism is horizontal. It is a more modern view of Biblical Judaism, but it is an attempt to remain true to the original Biblical path.</p>
<p>These synagogues were the places of prayer for a different tradition of Judaism in the sixth century. Much like the Sadducees or the Karaites or the Essenes who did not really survive the test of time, this group eventually vanished. But they clearly rejected the tradition that has been recorded and preserved in the Talmud and that is by and large practiced today by orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>The dogma of the vertical Judaism that Zanger describes is not necessarily offensive to our modern notions of Torah Judaism. Their belief was that there was a natural order as described by Greek Philosphy but Israel was above that natural order. This explains why the Jewish symbols were always above the Pagan symbols in the mosaic hierarchy. The God of Israel was supreme and the natural world was subject to God and the People of Israel were above the natural order because of their fealty to God. The offensive thing here is including this imagery in the synagogue. Further, they seemed to have rejected rabbinic Judaism as described in the Talmud. This rejection alone is sufficient to set them apart from our tradition.</p>
<p>Considering that this is a possibility, I think we gain insight into some of the fears of the rabbis in the Talmud. The things that they were careful to avoid and that they wanted to prevent could very well be represented by these synagogues and the religion associated with them. On the other hand, astrology is fairly prominent in the Talmud. I would not go so far as to say that the rabbis of the Talmud would endorse its imagery in the synagogue, but the they were definitely involved in astrology.</p>
<p>I am fairly certain that if you read the article, you will find it very interesting. If you don&#8217;t care for the content and analysis, you&#8217;ll still love the photos. So check out the article and let me know what you think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://Daf.finkorswim.com"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6092" title="wasserzeichen-projekte.php_" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wasserzeichen-projekte.php_.jpeg?resize=300%2C100" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>As I mentioned previously, (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/07/31/ode-to-the-siyum-hashas/">Ode to the Siyum HaShas</a>) the Siyum HaShas is a great source of inspiration for me and for many others.  The simplest way to channel that inspiration is to attempt to join the hundreds of thousands of Daf Yomi learners as the program begins from the start of the Talmud on Thursday.</p>
<p>I want to count myself among the many Daf Yomi students and would also like my shul to be a place where Daf Yomi is studied. I also love learning and teaching Talmud. So we have formulated and implemented a Daf Yomi plan at <a href="pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a> and we are including all of you.</p>
<p>I have set up a new site at <a href="http://daf.finkorswim.com" target="_blank">Daf.Finkorswim.com</a>.<span id="more-6091"></span> On that site I will be posting videos and podcasts of every daf. The live classes are being held in advance of the daf schedule so they will be available online on the daf schedule. You can subscribe to the YouTube Channel for the videos or to the podcasts in iTunes, or just visit the site daily. The daf podcasts are separate from the non-daf podcasts. Hopefully we can keep pace and hopefully the online community will make use of the site.</p>
<p>The style of the class will be a fast paced run through the daf. The assumption will be that you do not need any prior Talmud experience to understand the class or appreciate the material. I hope to keep each class between 20-30 minutes. There are many resources on other sites if you want to go more in depth, my idea is to make it as simple and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>So, if you are interested in joining the Daf Yomi program I have made it pretty easy to do from the comfort of your home, your car, your lunch break, wherever, and I hope you will avail yourself to the new site. If you have any suggestions please send them my way.</p>

The event is a massive spectacle and the orthodox Jewish community is on display. The Olympics come every 4 years. The Siyum HaShas comes around once every 7 and half years. This is a huge opportunity for positive Jewish media coverage and a chance to inspire the world.</p>
<p>Agudath Israel of America does an excellent job preparing and managing the siyum. It is easy to quibble or complain about a project of this magnitude, but overall they do a really good job.</p>
<p>Rabbis Frand and Lau are the featured speakers and they are excellent choices. These keynote speakers are moderates. That just means that the right wingers think they are too left wing and the left wingers think they are too right wing. In my opinion that is a good decision as opposed to trying to find one representative from each micro-subsection of orthodox Judaism.<span id="more-6087"></span></p>
<p>One only need look to the cornucopia of Siyum HaShas&#8217; in Israel to see how difficult Agudah&#8217;s job is and that they have been by and large successful. In Israel there are many, many siyums and most of them are sect-centric. Meaning, the attendees are mostly monolithic and &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t dare go to the other siyums&#8221;. (See the article in Haaretz linked below.) The plain fact is that in America almost all orthodox Jews go to one siyum or they join is via a satellite siyum. But it is all in the spirit of unity.</p>
<p>This is the greatest feature of Daf Yomi. The beauty of Daf Yomi is that wherever one goes, there are Jews studying the same part of the Talmud. The Torah is our most important asset as a people and Daf Yomi assists the Torah as a unifying banner under which we all pledge allegiance. It is fitting that the siyum be almost as universal as possible, bringing together the best feature of Daf Yomi and the beauty of Torah.</p>
<p>I am proud to be attending my third Siyum HaShas. One of my grandfathers took me when I was 9 years old to the siyum and my other grandfather met us there and bought me my first Gemara. Seven and a half years later I attended my second siyum with my grandfather. I was unable to attend the next siyum, but this year I will be attending. More importantly, my nine year old son will be attending his first siyum as well. My father, his grandfather, will be taking him and his other grandfather will be there as well. It comes full circle.</p>
<p>This really represents what the siyum is all about. Torah is transmitted from father to son and sometimes from grandfather to grandson as well. The siyum is not just a celebration for the dedicated daf yomi participants. It is also a monument of our dedication to Torah and Torah study. The sheer numbers of participants and the diversity of the participants is inspiring and gives us all hope for our future.</p>
<p>Many people are inspired to attempt to join daf yomi with the start of a new cycle. The siyum, a celebration of completion, somehow inspires people to redouble their efforts toward their own Talmud study. I too am inspired by the siyum and the multitude of people celebrating their personal seven and a half year journey at the siyum. I am inspired by praying with 90,000 people in one venue. I am inspired by the everyday people who have taken part in this cosmic adventure. I look forward to being present at the siyum. I look forward to celebrating with the thousands of people finishing the entire Talmud for the first or for the fiftieth time.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Agudah for doing their best to keep the celebration as universal as possible. To those who are boycotting the siyum I say, you are on the wrong side of this issue. Torah unifies us and if we are unable to come together to celebrate Torah, there is a very deep problem with your approach to Torah and Judaism. We need to unite over things we agree upon, not look with a magnifying glass to find things we disagree upon.</p>
<p>The siyum will be glorious and the people it inspires will make it worth it and then some. Let&#8217;s come together and savor this wonderful moment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_5636" style="width: 196px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gra.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5636" title="gra" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gra.jpg?resize=186%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Gaon of Vilna&#39;s Talmud</p></div>
<p>A few weeks ago, I was alerted to a very interesting article in the NY Times that provided some really good food for thought. The article sets its launching point at an ornithological discovery in 2005. A thought to extinct bird was spotted and the evidence was uploaded to the Internet.</p>
<p>It seems that although there was enough evidence for the journal Science, thousands of bird enthusiasts dissected the evidence and have conclusively shown the discovery to have been a hoax (or mistake).</p>
<p>This kind of thing happens all the time. And it&#8217;s been happening for a long time.</p>
<p>Going back to the earliest days of writing, readers would comment, redact, correct, disagree, argue, and question what they were reading by writing notes in the margins or writing glosses or writing something to counter what they had just read. Later, readers of both the original and the subsequent writings would sometimes collect them and publish them together. Sometimes they would fix the errors, other times they would just add the notes of others.</p>
<p>In fact, this is precisely how the Mishna and Talmud were composed.<span id="more-5635"></span> The Mishna is made up of short snippets of Jewish law that were culled from the notes of prior scholars. The compiler, Rabbi Yehuda HaNassi, combined earlier opinions with later opinions and used his judgment to produce the best result for the future of Judaism. The Talmud then records hundreds of years of conversations and annotations on the Mishna. Ravina and Rav Ashi made the final choices about which comments, arguments, proofs, anecdotes, discussions, and clarifications to include.</p>
<p>To a lesser degree the same thing happened with the Midrash, as the author of the NY Times article notes. Throughout Jewish history, scholars have been using this method to develop Jewish law and thought. This is the way many of the Rishonim and Achronim made their way into our daily lives. Rashi on Chumash is a great example of this. He took his favorite interpretations that he found in prior works and now they are found as part of his commentary in almost every Chumash printed. The many commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch follow the same pattern. They had notes in the margins of their copies of the Shulchan Aruch and later printers wished to include them in their new versions of the Shulchan Aruch and now the Shach and Taz are household names.</p>
<p>The NY Times article argues that the Internet creates the same kind of writer to commenter interface. The writer says something. The reader has something to say in return and the result is sometimes beautiful discussion, and other times flamewar. Either way, much of the value in today&#8217;s writing is not found in the original article, it is found in the comments section. Or in the Facebook comments, or the Tweets, or the Reddit threads. Wherever it is found, the readers&#8217; contributions often have a lot of value.</p>
<p>Some bloggers, like <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a>, consistently tout the excellence of the comments on their blog. I tend to agree. DovBear has had some amazing commenters. The posts on this blog don&#8217;t usually generate as robust conversations as the posts on his blog, but when there are good conversations here, the comments become the stars of the show and the posts become basic material for discussion. <em>(Parenthetically, DovBear&#8217;s blog comments from over 7000 posts are on the verge of being lost forever. A tragedy if I ever heard one&#8230;)</em></p>
<p>In the tradition of the redactors and later publishers of the great works of history that integrated the original writings with subsequent comments, the author of the NY Times article suggests that the Internet needs a redactor. The best comments and opinions that follow the original articles need to highlighted somehow, even integrated into the posts. The give and take of the comment thread produces excellent material and oftentimes helps the group come to a better truth. It would be such a shame if all that wisdom was lost in the black hole of cyberspace.</p>
<p>But the real powerful point of the article is that experts and non-experts have an equal voice in the comments. And the crowd has a unique ability to ferret out lies, fools, and fallacies. If we all take our commenting duties seriously, we can help the greater community arrive at truths that may have been otherwise missed, either intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p>When it comes to discourse on religion, clearly there are some ground rules upon which we all need to agree in order to facilitate positive discussion. But when the rules are agreed upon and the discussion is vociferous, yet civil, we can benefit from coming closer to a truth. That is just another of the incredibly powerful uses of the Internet for the orthodox Jew. If we ban it, we lose that opportunity. I don&#8217;t think that it is a stretch to say that the Internet might exist simply for us to make the most of that opportunity and make the future of orthodox Judaism as viable and vibrant as it must be for our children and grandchildren.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/laura-talmudStretch.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5618" title="laura-talmudStretch" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/laura-talmudStretch.jpg?resize=253%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I received a press release for the New English Talmud from Koren a few days ago. With all the excitement over the Asifa and the unexpected brouhaha over the role of women in chasidic Judaism, I neglected to post my initial thoughts on this edition of the Talmud.</p>
<p>First of all, I am a huge fan of the Talmud. I think studying Talmud is amazing. The experience of Talmud study, when done right, can be at least as inspirational and spiritually satisfying as anything else in the world. The problem is that it can be a locked book. An English translation is nice, but so much of the Talmud requires background information and illustration that the simple rendering of the words into English is not sufficient to unlock the Talmud.</p>
<p>Artscroll has magnificently risen to the occasion with their English Talmud. Their contribution marked a key turning point for mainstreaming Talmud study. Their translation and interpretations follow Yeshiva style conventions. The Artscroll Talmud may be the greatest contribution to Torah study since the first printing of the Tamud in the 16th century. Its commentary digest is extremely well researched and presented and the sheer magnitude of the project is awe-inspiring.<span id="more-5617"></span></p>
<p>It is hard to believe, but 30 years prior to the Artscroll Talmud was conceived, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz began a similar project translating the Talmud into modern Hebrew and penning a fresh Hebrew commentary digest. His work would have been more widely used if he had maintained the canonized page format of all the previous printings of the Talmud. But he did not and his version was placed under Rabbinic ban.</p>
<p>The New English Talmud will provide another option for English speaking sudents of the Talmud. The translation is adapted from Rabbi Steinsaltz&#8217;s translation into modern Hebrew and the commentary is his. But in keeping with tradition, the New English Talmud stays true to the canonized pagination of the Talmud thus rectifying an unfortunate error in the previous versions.</p>
<p>More options is a good thing. In particular, this version has an emphasis on the aesthetic, taking layout seriously and using color illustrations. It truly looks to be a remarkable and fresh way to study the Talmud. Plus, having two big names in the English Talmud game will force both to step up their games and bring even more innovative, high quality products to the market.</p>
<p>Artscroll announced their iPad app a few months ago. Koren is also supplying an app. Only a few details are available at this point but I look forward to using both of them.</p>
<p>My shul has a set of Artscroll and I have been gifted (by a loving family member) a significant selection of the New English Talmud so I will be able to do a more complete comparison after I receive my copy. In the meantime, if you are considering an English Talmud purchase, I strongly urge you to consider the Koren version. It looks to be amazing.</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, the YouTube video promo for the New English Talmud is a tad on the ridiculous side. I&#8217;m not sure what they were thinking.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SPA-SPAGLOBELOGO.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-5505 alignleft" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SPA-SPAGLOBELOGO.gif?resize=252%2C252" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A lot of the political discourse in American and in Europe revolves around economic models. The bold faced names in the discussion are capitalism and socialism. To be fair, no matter what, the United States will have a hybrid version because we will never get to a place where the system is completely capitalistic without taxation and social programs for the poor nor will we ever have a system of 100% taxation and governmental distribution of wealth.</p>
<p>In America, we are somewhere in the middle. Which is why I find it humorous when people call President Obama a socialist or Romney is touted as a true capitalist. It makes for good sound bites but the truth is that they are fairly close to one another economically. They might be on opposite extremes on the center. But they are not on opposite extremes of the spectrum the way Ayn Rand and Karl Marx are.</p>
<p>One fun argument is what the Bible has to say about these contemporary economic systems. Pretty much any view can be shoehorned into some passage from the Bible. So it is not a strong argument when one invokes scripture seeing as it so open to interpretation. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/03/wwjd/">WWJD?</a>)</p>
<p>However, Jewish Law does not follow the literal translation of scripture.<span id="more-5504"></span> Instead, Jewish Law follows the interpretations and codifications of the rabbis of the Mishnaic period and the analysis and expansion of those laws during the Talmudic period. These are &#8220;The Rabbis&#8221; that are referred to when people say things like &#8220;the rabbis said&#8230;&#8221;. In Hebrew they are known by their Hebrew acronym, Chazal.</p>
<p>The thing with Chazal is that they actually enacted specific legislation and we know the specific rules that they enforced. They are written in black and white in the Talmud. At <a href="http://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/social-legislation-in-the-talmud-isidore-epstein/" target="_blank">Kavvanah Blog</a> Rabbi Isidore Epstein&#8217;s introductory essay to the Talmud was posted and among many other fascinating issues, the essay addresses this particular point.</p>
<p>Rabbi Epstein enumerates dozens of regulatory laws in the Talmud. These are laws that were enacted and enforced by Chazal in a governmental capacity. Anyone who has studied the Talmud is familiar with many of these laws. But to see them rattled off one by one and analyzed through the lens of a 20th century scholar is very eye opening.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of Jewish Laws:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guarantee of public trees from which anyone could pluck</li>
<li>Highly regulated weights and measures</li>
<li>Agencies that regulated quality control of food and other goods</li>
<li>Common rights on real property that was owned</li>
<li>Price control over the sale of chattel</li>
<li>Rights for workers, including going beyond the letter of the law for their benefit</li>
<li>Protection of tenants</li>
<li>Competitive practices when there was no need for additional</li>
<li>Charity taxes that were distributed to the poor</li>
</ul>
<p>This short list does not do it justice. I think it impossible to read the essay and not draw the conclusion that Chazal endorsed a pretty severe form of socialism. That is not to say that they would endorse the same system for the United States of America in 2012. But it is to say, that the most traditional form of economic policy in orthodox Judaism is pretty close to socialism.</p>
<p>I do note that there were protective policies in place that were designed to prevent over-reliance on the social benefits of Rabbinic Judaism and some policies were skewed more to the side of capitalism. However, it is almost impossible to find ideas like <em>caveat emptor</em> or &#8220;the marketplace will decide what is fair or moral&#8221; in their system of commerce.</p>
<p>At the very least, the essay shows that many aspects of a social economy were considered moral and preferable to Chazal.</p>
<p>The essay is a must-read for its economic theory as well as its broader implications that are discussed more fully on Kavvanah. I cannot recommend reading the essay enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fshas.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5217" title="fshas" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fshas-300x176.jpg?resize=300%2C176" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In case you have not heard, Artscroll is joining the digital revolution. Perhaps Artscroll&#8217;s greatest contribution to date is the Schottenstein Talmud. Their version of the Talmud is comprehensive and useful for beginners and scholars alike. It has likely opened the doors of Talmud study to more people than any other edition of the Talmud in the history of the Talmud.</p>
<p>Now Artscroll is taking the Talmud to the next level. As mentioned previously, the iPad is a magical Torah study device. It lends itself to Torah study more than any other piece of technology. You can hold it in your hand, you navigate with your fingers, pop-ups are the perfect method for providing additional information beyond the text that is so key to Talmud study. Artscroll is bringing the Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud to the iPad.</p>
<p>The features are extensive and the video below outlines many of the key features. It&#8217;s a really impressive feature set.<span id="more-5216"></span></p>
<p>iTalmud did a wonderful job with their limited resources. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/14/italmud-ipad-edition-app-review/" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a>. They did not have access to the copyrighted material and research that went into the Schottenstein edition. But iTalmud pales in comparison to what Artscroll can offer. Of course I expect this to be reflected in the price, iTalmud is $40. Each volume of the printed Shottenstein Talmud is $40 and some tractates are several volumes long. If ebook prices are any indication, the Artscroll digital edition will be priced similarly to the printed edition. That is a lot of money.</p>
<p>A source tells me that there will be various options to gain access to the app. You can buy a daf, a tractate or the entire Shas. There will also be a rental model that will allow users to follow along with the Daf Yomi giving access to each particular daf for a limited time. I think the price will be one of the more interesting story lines as the app moves from development to the marketplace.</p>
<p>The iPad will be the first digital edition of the Shottenstein but my source also tells me that Android and desktop version will eventually follow.</p>
<p>Artscroll has hired the best Jewish app developer out there in <a href="http://www.rustybrick.com/" target="_blank">RustyBrick</a> to write the software and you can be confident that the final product will be elegant, simple to use and very powerful. RustyBrick also works hard to constantly update their apps to bring more features to the end users. I am happy for my friends at RustyBrick.</p>
<p>Artscroll is doing this because they think it will be a good business decision. I am happy that they are ready to embrace the digital era. Now we just need to get our yeshivos and rabbinic leaders to follow the lead of the community.</p>
<p>Here is a severely overdramatic video about the upcoming app. Whatever happened to understated, humble marketing? Yeesh. This thing is way out of control. (I also don&#8217;t love using copyrighted music for a product that so covets its own copyrights.) But shout out to my friend <a href="http://baltimorejewishlife.com" target="_blank">Jeff Cohn</a> who makes a cameo at 3:00!</p>

<p>One of my favorite topics and themes in Judaism is understanding the structure and methodology of the Talmud. I am constantly looking for more sources and studying, adapting and adjusting my understanding of the issues. Until I read the post on Kavvanah I did not know about the introduction to the Talmud written by Rabbi J.H. Hertz. I read it and I loved it.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest you read the entire introduction. It is written beautifully and with such an inspiring view of the Talmud that it becomes required reading.</p>
<p>Some highlights:<span id="more-5051"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Like nearly every one of the rabbis, he earned his bread by manual labour.</em></p>
<p>Speaking about the rabbis of the Talmud, R&#8217; Hertz reminds us that the rabbis of the Talmud worked for a living. They studied when they were able. He wrote this before the standardization of kollel. But it is almost prophetically inspired.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Concerning the exact time at which the Mishnah was committed to writing, diversity of opinion has prevailed among eminent Jewish authorities during the last nine centuries.</em></p>
<p>I never knew this. But apparently, R&#8217; Sherira Gaon and Rashi, among others held that the Mishna was not actually written down until the 8th or 9th century. I would love to see a citation for this. Either way, this is astounding to me. I was always taught that R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi codified AND wrote down the mishna. It seems that these authorities held that the Mishna was codified by R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi and was transmitted orally for a few hundred years before it was published in written form. Clearly, Rambam disagrees. Fascinating.</p>
<p>Here is the best part:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Halachah, as we have seen, means ‘the trodden path’, rule of life, religious guidance. To it belong all laws and regulations that bear upon Jewish conduct. These include the ritual, the civil, criminal, and ethical laws.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Everything else is embraced under the term Haggadah; literally, ‘talk’, ‘that which is narrated’, ‘delivered in a discourse’. This again can he subdivided into various groups. We have dogmatical Haggadah, treating of God’s attributes and providence, creation, revelation, Messianic times, and the Hereafter. The historical Haggadah brings traditions and legends concerning the heroes and events in national or universal history, from Adam to Alexander of Macedon, Titus and Hadrian. It is legend pure and simple. Its aim is not so much to give the facts concerning the righteous and unrighteous makers of history. as the moral that may be pointed from the tales that adorn their honour or dishonour.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>That some of the folklore element in the Haggadah, some of the customs depicted or obiter dicta reported. are repugnant to Western taste need not be denied. ‘The greatest fault to be found with those who wrote down such passages. says Schechter, ‘is that they did not observe the wise rule of Dr Johnson who said to Boswell on a certain occasion, “Let us get serious, for there comes a fool”. And the fools unfortunately did come, in the shape of certain Jewish commentators and Christian controversialists, who took as serious things which were only the expression of a momentary impulse. or represented the opinion of sonic isolated individual, or were meant simply as a piece of humorous by-play, calculated to enliven the interest of a languid audience.’</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In spite of the fact that the Haggadah contains parables of infinite beauty and enshrines sayings of eternal worth, it must be remembered that the Haggadah consists of mere individual utterances that possess no general and binding authority.</em></p>
<p>This is a loaded paragraph and one that today is considered highly controversial. R&#8217; Hertz has the broad shoulders necessary to make such a statement and I admire him greatly for making it. What he is saying is that the Talmud has statements that are binding and many that are not. The difference between the two is whether or not they are halachic. Further, it should not be a surprise to anyone if the rabbis of the Talmud were inaccurate in their non-halachic statements. Some were mistakes, others were made for purposes other than for their truth. R&#8217; Hertz charges those who take these non-serious statements with greater seriousness than they were intended as fools. I wouldn&#8217;t be so harsh. But I agree with the sentiment.</p>
<p>I wonder what would happen if a prominent rabbi wrote this today.</p>
<p>And finally another excellent line in conclusion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>My purpose is merely to give a brief presentation of the Talmud as a book. I shall therefore conclude with the words of I. Abrahams. ‘The Talmud,’ he says, ‘is one of the great books of the world. Rabbinism was a sequel to the Bible; and if, like all sequels, it was unequal to its original, it nevertheless shares its greatness. The works of all Jews up to the modern period were the sequel to this sequel. Through them all may be detected the unifying principle that literature in its truest sense includes life itself; that intellect is the handmaid to conscience; and that the best books are those which best teach men how to live. The maxim, Righteousness delivers from death, applies to books as well as to men. A literature whose consistent theme is Righteousness, is immortal.’</em></p>
<p>Through it all, the Talmud is one of the greatest books ever written. It&#8217;s true, the sequel is at least as good as the original. We follow the Talmud in our lives and the Talmud interprets the Torah. It&#8217;s world certainly seems different to the naked eye than the world of the Bible. Says, R&#8217; Hertz, this is a good thing.</p>
<p>Above all, the Talmud is an attempt at righteousness and aids us all in our attempts towards the same.</p>
<p>Now go study!</p>

See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/10/22/italmud-english-edition-review/">iTalmud English Edition: Review</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A few months ago we got an iPad and I could not wait to try <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a>. Torah learning is much easier on a bigger screen and the navigation through an iPad app is less crowded than on an iPhone. I&#8217;ve been testing the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a> and it with recent updates and the bigger screen the iPad app is one of the best apps I have used on the iPad. Period.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I figured to give you all a real taste of what using <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a> is like I would give you a walkthrough with photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Before we begin, I will just say that if you have an iPad and have any interest in studying Talmud, this is the absolutely best way to do it. The Torah is timeless and when technology can be leveraged to make the experience more accessible, exciting and convenient, it speaks to the eternal nature of the Torah and its people. When you think about it, it can be quite inspiring.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here we go:<span id="more-4914"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I always begin studying a page of the Talmud with the traditional page view.  iTalmud provides clear PDFs of every folio of the Talmud. It is a straight PDF with no iOS magic. Functional and perhaps enough to justify spending $40. Imagine having the entire Talmud accessible on an iPad!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0036.png"><img class="wp-image-4916 aligncenter" title="IMG_0036" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0036.png?resize=614%2C461" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>To change pages, one taps the book icon on the top of the page and using the iOS selection wheel can turn to any Tractate and any page in that Tractate in an instant. It takes about 2 seconds to download each PDF over wifi. It does not feel like you are &#8220;waiting&#8221; when you switch pages. Here I have switched from Shabbos to Brachos in an instant. In real life that would mean going to a bookshelf and replacing one overly large tome with another. Amazing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0035.png"><img class="wp-image-4915 aligncenter" title="IMG_0035" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0035.png?resize=614%2C461" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If you want to be able to read folio pages when offline you can download PDFs of every Daf View page and save them for later in the Download Manager. There is no charge to keep these on your iPad. Additionally, the app provides excellent audio classes for each page. These can also be downloaded and saved for later.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0037.png"><img class="wp-image-4917 aligncenter" title="IMG_0037" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0037.png?resize=614%2C461" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let&#8217;s move on. Daf View is nice, but the other stuff is where we experience the real magic of iTalmud. I use landscape view for viewing the PDFs. It just seems more natural. But for the other modes I mostly use portrait view. (We will stick with landscape for now.) Switching modes is simple. Just tap the page icon on he bottom left. A menu pops up and you can select how you would like iTalmud to display text. Until now we have been using Daf View.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0039.png"><img class=" wp-image-4919 aligncenter" title="IMG_0039" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0039.png?resize=614%2C461" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now I&#8217;ve selected &#8220;Hebrew Text&#8221; and &#8220;Rashi&#8221;. As you can see, this view is just text without the traditional Daf format. But I have also selected Rashi and the commentary is displayed split-screen style on the left. The two columns are independent and can be scrolled on their own. So if Rashi is lower down on the page you can scroll the left side down but leave the right side where it is. This is great.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0040.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4920" title="IMG_0040" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0040.png?resize=614%2C461" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We also can select Tosfos and Tosfos will be displayed instead of Rashi. Everything else remains the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0041.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4921" title="IMG_0041" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0041.png?resize=614%2C461" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another option is to have the English translation displayed. This translation is the Soncino translation with the Footnotes. If you tap a footnote and popup displays the text of the footnote.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0042.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4922" title="IMG_0042" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0042.png?resize=614%2C461" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ve switched the view to portrait. In this view, the secondary text, in this case Rashi, gets moved to the bottom of the screen. I have also tapped on the Daf Yomi shiurim menu. Here, we can see a list of local Daf Yomi classes and their locations. Languages are included so that you can find the class that best meets your needs. You can also enter an address and find  class near that address. Unfortunately, this feature did not work for me. The keyboard kept disappearing. I hope this is fixed in a future update.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0043.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4923" title="IMG_0043" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0043.png?resize=461%2C614" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sometimes you want to go directly to a specific page. You can easily navigate to any page using the browse and search menu. The English Keyword search is also great. As I have beards on my mind (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/13/the-shave-heard-round-the-world/">The Shave Heard &#8216;Round the World</a>) I typed &#8220;beard&#8221; into the search and the results displayed everywhere the word beard occurs in the Talmud. This is a really super tool. Tapping a result sends you to that page. This is great, but could be better. The place on the page that the word occurs is not highlighted anywhere. This would not be so bad if there were a &#8220;search this page&#8221; option but iTalmud does not have that feature yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0044.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4924" title="IMG_0044" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0044.png?resize=461%2C614" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One of the coolest things in the iTalmud app is a $5 add-on. I bought it because it was useful to me and I think it is a great feature. To bring up the extras pop-up just tap on the Extras menu icon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0045.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4925" title="IMG_0045" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0045.png?resize=461%2C614" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">With Biblical References&#8221; add-on you can tap any verse from Scripture that is quoted in the Talmud and explore that verse. So just click buy and then it is automatically built into the app.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0047.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4927" title="IMG_0047" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0047.png?resize=461%2C614" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, I tapped a verse on Brachos 2a. Tapping the verse brings up a menu where you can choose which commentary should be displayed with the text of the verse from the Torah. I chose English. The verse is automatically highlighted and the commentary is inline.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0049.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4929" title="IMG_0049" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0049.png?resize=461%2C614" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I tried to select Rashi, but it was not working. That&#8217;s another kink that needs to be worked out. But the others work. Here is the Ramban on that verse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0050.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4930" title="IMG_0050" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0050.png?resize=461%2C614" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And here is Ibn Ezra. It could not be simpler.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0051.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4931" title="IMG_0051" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0051.png?resize=461%2C614" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also want to show you a full-screen view that removes the menus and just shows the text on the screen. This is the ideal method for studying. No distractions and it uses the maximum of the real estate. It would even better if iTalmud could do Airplay and be displayed on an external display. Maybe next version&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0052.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-4932" title="IMG_0052" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG_0052.png?resize=614%2C461" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So there you have it. That&#8217;s how I use iTalmud English for iPad. I am sure many of you would use it differently. That&#8217;s part of the beauty of the app. It can be used your way.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I have one more suggestion for a future release (my father actually suggested it to me). It would be great if illustrations and models could be provided as well. The Talmud can be so well illuminated by diagrams and graphics. Some sections require illustrations. I hope a future release could provide pop-up graphics for these sections of the Talmud.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other than that, search on the page and a couple of bugs iTalmud is one of the most complete iPad apps I have had the pleasure of using. I highly recommend the app and even more than the app, I recommend studying Talmud.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Purchase the app here: <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/italmud-ipad-edition/id390170996?mt=8" target="_blank">iTalmud &#8211; iPad Edition</a>. Check out <a href="http://www.crowdedroad.com/" target="_blank">Crowded Road’s other apps and services on their website</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_4520" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/s_nf_3897_233121.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4520" title="old Torah" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/s_nf_3897_233121.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A really old Torah scroll</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m no scholar of ancient texts. But there are scholars of ancient texts. A large group of them has been studying the evolution of the text of the Tanach (the Jewish version of the Old Testament) for 53 years.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the text we have today has remained virtually unchanged since the 11th century. It was then that Maimonides used the Aleppo Codex to codify a version of the Torah scroll. That version is almost exactly what we have today.</p>
<p>But notice, I used the word &#8220;almost&#8221;. That&#8217;s because it is not exactly the same. Or it might not be exact. There are several nuances that differentiate the standard Torah scroll used in the majority of Jewish communities from the Yemenite Torah text tradition. They can&#8217;t both be exactly the same as the text codified by Maimonides.<span id="more-4518"></span></p>
<p>Certainly the Talmud seems to indicate that they had a different version. The Talmud in Kiddushin gives specific places as the middle of the text and the number of words and letters. None of those are consistent with our text. In several places various rishonim (Medieval commentators) indicate that there were small differences between the Torah scrolls among their peers. Other rishonim stated that the text was deliberately changed by later prophets in certain instances. They were permitted to do so as long as none of the Torah&#8217;s laws were affected by their changes.</p>
<p>None of the differences that have been recorded are significant enough to change the law. None of the discrepancies have an effect of the theology or religion of the Torah. Yet, there has emerged a &#8220;sacred belief&#8221; that the Torah remains unchanged over the 3000 years since the Revelation at Sinai.</p>
<p>This is quite obviously impossible.</p>
<p>A massive project in Israel is charting all the extant versions of the text and their collective history. They are using every possible version and manuscript to show any and all minor differences between each version. The Aleppo Codex is the starting point for the project and all differences are being compared to that version.</p>
<p>And there are differences. It is impossible to pretend otherwise. But this should not be a problem for believers in orthodox Judaism. There are several acceptable approaches to the issues raised by the variations in the text. Each approach appeals to different styles within orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>1) Hashgacha pratis. God runs the world. Whatever changes that have evolved are part of a grand Master Plan.</p>
<p>2) Lo bashamayim hi. &#8220;The Torah is not in the Heavens&#8221;. Once the Torah was given to Man, it was understood that there would be mistakes. We do our best to avoid mistakes, but errors are inevitable and it cannot be legitimately stated that our version is perfect.</p>
<p>3) Torah She&#8217;Baal Peh is primary. The truth is that we do not live our lives as orthodox Jews based on the Written Law as much as we lived based on its interpretation in the Oral Law. Mistakes in the Written Law have no real bearing on a Jewish life based on the Oral Law.</p>
<p>Certainly each of these positions is more nuanced and broad than the one or two sentence headlines mentioned here. The point is that approaches exist and we should not be afraid of them.</p>
<p>What about the 8th principle of faith according to the Rambam?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img title="Someone is wrong of the Internet" src="http://i2.wp.com/imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png?resize=300%2C330" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Best. Cartoon. Ever. ©xkcd</p></div>
<p>The blogosphere is really one giant argument. Opinions are expressed, supported, rebutted, debated, refined and discarded on a daily basis. One has to wonder if anyone ever wins. Is anyone ever swayed by an argument on a blog or even in person? Will anyone change their mind based on an argument? How and when do we change our minds?</p>
<p>These questions are impossible for me to answer. But I have feelings about each of these questions. I have had so many arguments in real life and on the Internet about so many different things. Ranging from sports, to politics, to religion, to culture and everything in between.</p>
<p>Of course my opinions have changed over time. But how did it happen? Did I lose an argument and my mind was changed? It&#8217;s impossible to know how it works and when the switch gets turned. But learning is a process and people can change their minds. It just feels like they never do.</p>
<p>Of course, I have also spent significant time arguing over and reading arguments in the Talmud and its commentaries.<span id="more-4361"></span> The Talmud is basically one giant argument. There are many opinions about many things and their validity is questioned and challenged with logical reasoning, textual support and moral arguments. The many commentaries on the Talmud argue about how to codify the law, explain various passages and answer contradictions in logic and thought. Very frequently arguments are won or conceded.</p>
<p>The assumption in all arguments and especially in the arguments in the Talmud is that there is a search for truth that is behind the arguments. Each side believes that they have the truth and when the truth becomes apparent the loser will concede that their opinion is incorrect and change their mind. As mentioned before, this doesn&#8217;t seem to happen in real life. Although in the Talmud it happens on just about every page. To be fair, the ones doing the conceding are rarely the owners of the opinion, rather it is the proponents of that opinion. We are left to wonder what the author of the losing opinion would have held had he been presented with the winning arguments.</p>
<p>A recent NY Times article mentions a study that attempts to redefine argument. According to the study we do not argue or use reason to find the truth. Rather we argue with logic and reason, sometimes very flawed, to win the argument and support a previously held position. This is something like confirmation bias. Our opinion is not formed by reason, our powers of reason are used to support an opinion that we want to hold.</p>
<p>This is significant because it really means the real reason that we argue is not with the expectation that we will change anyone&#8217;s mind. Rather it is so that we can convince ourselves of our opinion and win the argument. In other words, winning is more important that being right. In fact this is exactly how the law works in the secular court system. We don&#8217;t care who is right, we care who presents a better case. We don&#8217;t care if the defendant committed the crime, we care whether it can proved that he committed the crime.</p>
<p><em>(If you read the article you will see that the article uses the law as an example of deciding who is right. I don&#8217;t believe the author of the article characterizes the law correctly.)</em></p>
<p>So, in the Talmud the object is certainly to find some sort of truth. I don&#8217;t believe the article would apply to the Talmud as the objective there is clear and established. But I am willing to consider that arguing has evolved into a competition of who wins and who loses as opposed to who is right and who is wrong.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that arguing cannot lead to the truth. It just means that is why arguing evolved and it is part of every single argument that ever existed and will ever exist. Arguing to win can lead to truth. It&#8217;s just not the explanation for why we argue and why we choose certain logic and fallacies to support our position.</p>
<p>That also doesn&#8217;t mean arguing isn&#8217;t important or valuable. On the contrary, I also believe that the winning arguments that are best supported by their arguers will over time represent some kind of truth. Sometimes the truth is empirical, but most of the time, the truth is that there is a bias that must be confirmed. Admitted that or acknowledging that can be the case is important. Especially in the areas of religion.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Right now, the entire world is is divided into two groups. (At least it seems that way.)

(At least it seems that way.)</p>
<p>Group 1: Passionately interested and soaking in every excrutiating detail about the Royal Wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton.</p>
<p>Group 2: Passionately DISinterested and annoyed at every excruciating detail about the Royal Wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton.</p>
<p>As for me, I just wondered what Prince William&#8217;s surname is. I found the answer on Wikipedia and it&#8217;s not as simple as one would think! (&#8230;it&#8217;s Mountbatten-Windsor by the way)</p>
<p>All this talk about Monarchs got me thinking about whether there is a Jewish reason to be interested in the wedding and the Prince. Immediately I thought of the statement of the Babylonian Talmud in tractate Brachos<span id="more-4186"></span> that is mentioned on 3 separate occasions (9b, 19b, 58a).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Said R&#8217; Yochanan: One should always attempt to run to greet the kings of Israel. Not only should he run to greet the kings of Israel, but he should also run to greet the kings of idol worshipers so that if he merits [Rashi: to earn a place in the Next World and see the Messiah] he will be able to see the difference [Rashi: between the honor accorded a secular king and the honor accorded to righteous people]. (Rashi from 58a, translation: mine)</em></p>
<p>There is an eternal message in this passage: We can learn from everything.</p>
<p>Even during the time of R&#8217; Yochanan, when non-Jewish kings did not take too kindly to the Jews, R&#8217; Yochanan taught that it was important to see the honor given to the great monarchs of his time. Was there any real value in simply seeing the king? Perhaps a bit. It certainly was a nice gesture of appreciation to the monarch. But the real value was found in the lessons that could be gleaned from seeing the tremendous honor bestowed upon the king.</p>
<p>If a despot or even benevolent king receive such honor then we can only imagine the great honor reserved for those who act righteously. After all, what is really important? Fleeting honor granted by virtue of fate of birth or earned via might and power? Or a good moral life?</p>
<p>There is no question, the greater honor belongs to the one who has used their time wisely and chosen life.</p>
<p>If you want a sneak peak at what that honor will be like, tune in (if only for a moment) to the Royal Wedding.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/typewriter.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4046" title="typewriter" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/typewriter.jpg?resize=300%2C265" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I read a fascinating article about an interesting phenomena in the NY Times.</p>
<p>Technology pervades our lives. Phones that have little computers inside them that can take lovely photos and videos, share them with the world, access the entire Internet and make a phone call live in our pockets. We have computers at home. We have computers at work. Many people use electronic devices to read books. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/12/23/orthodox-jews-and-e-readers/">Orthodox Jews and E-Readers</a>).</p>
<p>Some people feel like it has gone too far.</p>
<p>As a result, typewriters are surging in popularity. The unwieldy, noisy, with no delete button typewriters of the 40&#8217;s and 50&#8217;s. I am not that old, but when I was in 2nd grade I remember the school office secretary had a typewriter. But it was fancy and used a screen to show what you were typing, even had an automatic delete function and was not black metal. Those are not the popular typewriters. People want the old fashioned ones.<span id="more-4045"></span></p>
<p>A really nice point is made in the article by a Ms. Kowalski:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“You type so much quicker than you can think on a computer,” Ms. Kowalski said. “On a typewriter, you have to think.”</em></p>
<p>Writing on a computer is like using a pencil. Typing on a typewriter is using pen, or perhaps more like chiseling into a stone. Because we can type faster than we write, sometimes we write things that are incorrect, or stupid. The same thing happens when we speak before we consider the weight of our words. It can be a great exercise in cognition to type without the luxury of delete. I had a half a thought to publish this post in typewriter style, that is, without deleting or modifying anything. It would have been incoherent. I can barely write one sentence without making a correction or two, or three.</p>
<p>But the message is clear. Sometimes we do need to slow down.</p>
<p>Another great lesson I learned from the typewriter enthusiasts is the need to focus. Just while writing this blog post, I have checked and replied to email, replied to a Twitter conversation and commented on a Facebook post. There is something about using a uni-tasker. A typewriter can only do one thing. It helps one to focus and I suppose that is a good thing too.</p>
<p>The last thing I take from this typewriter revival is a bit of nostalgia. Some of us have it, some of us don&#8217;t. But in orthodox Jewish life there is much nostalgia. One of the greatest areas of this nostalgia is in the area of Torah study. Old books are treasured and revered. Old printings of those books are treasured and revered. Most significantly, old ideas are treasured and revered.</p>
<p>Using a book to study Torah is the standard. Torah scholars pore over books with ink and paper every day. Many of those texts are available digitally. But the old fashioned way lives on. When no one in the world is reading books anymore, I am positive that Torah will still be studied from books and read during services from scrolls. That nostalgia is built into Judaism. We revere the ancient, we respect the past, we look back to our parents and grand parents with love and admiration and we integrate all that into our present and future.</p>
<p>Personally, I love old things. Maybe one day I will get myself a typewriter, but until then I will need to practice typing more effectively the first time around&#8230;</p>

<p>We sometimes forget how fortunate we are. We have access to the greatest inventions, medical care, information, comfortable living conditions, every kind of food under the sun and things our great grandparents only could have dreamed of. Sure we have our probelms too. But our problems are mostly &#8220;<a href="http://therealfirstworldproblems.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">First World Problems</a>&#8220;. The Internet goes down during an epic Internet battle, our cell phone drops an important call, our takeout food is a bit soggy etc etc etc. These are First World Problems.</p>
<p>Around the world, others have Third World Problems. Dirty water, no medical care, hunger, extreme poverty, no electricity etc etc etc. Depending on where we are in the world, our problems are to varying degrees. The solutions to those problems depends on our ingenuity, willingness to think out of the box and creativity. Everywhere you go, people are dealing with whatever obstacles present themselves. Or sometimes people stagnate and resign themselves to their problems and don&#8217;t seek solutions. To me, that is failure.</p>
<p>Throughout history, Jewish people have use difficult situations to improve the world.<span id="more-4029"></span> In fact, the Talmud, one of the greatest gifts to mankind, is really a result of persectution. Due to the banning of Torah study and a lack of communication between various academies it became necessary to record the Talmud for posterity. Imagine if they had simply thrown in the towel and felt their impossible situation had no solution. The world would be a far darker place.</p>
<p>In our own lives we may be riddled with complications or issues and we don&#8217;t know how to extricate ourselves from our situation or fix what is broken. That is a sad place to be. We can all suffer from lack of inspiration at times. If you are feeling even just a tad uninspired I have the perfect way to jumpstart your creative juices. Watch this video.</p>
<p>On a floating village in Thailand called Koh Panyee the youth had nowhere to play soccer. But they needed an outlet. So they got creative and it paid off for them in a big way. The short film is based on the true story from 1986.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

A kal v&#8217;chomer is the Talmud&#8217;s version of the a fortiori argument.</p>
<p>That is, if A is more advanced than B, if A can do X, B can certainly do X. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_fortiori_argument" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> uses this example: &#8220;If it has been established that a person is deceased, then one can, with equal or greater certainty, argue that the person is not breathing.&#8221;</p>
<p>When invoking the kal v&#8217;chomer in Talmud study, it is the opportune moment to utilize the familiar Talmudic sing-song as well as a &#8220;thumb dip&#8221; to emphasize your point. (Speaking of which, the thumb dip needs a wikipedia entry&#8230; no?)<span id="more-3346"></span></p>
<p>Anyway, the kal v&#8217;chomer is not considered a perfect argument by the Talmud. No punishments are able to be given as a result of a kal v&#8217;chomer.</p>
<p>The weakness of a kal v&#8217;chomer is mostly due to the lack of external information that could prove that A is not stronger than B for another reason.</p>
<p>This graphic demonstrates exactly why the kal v&#8217;chomer doesn&#8217;t always work&#8230;</p>
<p>Sports fans love trying to prove their team&#8217;s supremacy by using the kal v&#8217;chomer. Team A beat Team B and Team B beat Team C so Team A can certainly beat Team C. The problem is, this is a complete fallacy. There are matchup issues, injury issues, effort issues plus the element of luck.</p>
<p>The graphic shows how there are no kal v&#8217;chomer&#8217;s in the NFL. As you go clockwise, the first team has defeated the second team, thus, imperically demonstrating that anyone can win on &#8220;Any Given Sunday&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1597" title="iTalmud" src="http://i1.wp.com/66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/iTalmud.jpg?resize=100%2C101" alt="iTalmud" data-recalc-dims="1" />I love technology and I love Talmud. So imagine how excited I was when I found out that I could learn Talmud on my iPhone!</p>
<p>For the last few weeks I have been testing an incredible iPhone app. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=326474560&amp;mt=8">iTalmud English Edition</a> (warning: link will open iTunes) is one the best apps I have ever used on the iPhone.</p>
<p>iTalmud English Edition is a very powerful tool that anyone that wishes to study or research anything in the Talmud must have.<span id="more-1596"></span></p>
<p><strong>User Interface</strong></p>
<p>All good iPhone apps maintain the beauty and simplicity of the iPhone in their user experience. iTalmud English Edition is all those and much more. It is so easy to use and so elegantly presented that it almost feels like an iPhone app developed by Apple! When you start the app you get a simple menu with the basic functions of iTalmud English Edition.</p>
<p><strong>What Does iTalmud English Edition Do?</strong></p>
<p>The app brings the entire Talmud to your fingertips. You can browse the entire Talmud by page or search the entire Talmud by term. The app includes an English translation of the Talmud that is easily accessed as well.  In addition, audio classes of every single page are available via the menu. You can find any Daf Yomi class in the world from the menu as well.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Talmud</strong></p>
<p>There are 3 ways to read Talmud in iTalmud English Edition. The default view is a modern Hebew font text view. The text size is large enough to read and wherever Rashi has a commentary the words are hyperlinked so that clicking the text will bring up the Rashi. Very intuitive and perhaps the way Rashi intended us using his commentary &#8211; through hyperlinks! iTalmud English Edition also gives you the standard Talmud page view. When invoked, the app downloads a pdf of the folio with the tzuras hadaf preserved. Using multitouch gestures like pinching to zoom and flicking to scroll you can navigate the page pretty easily. The 3rd way to read Talmud with iTalmud English Edition is to read in English. The user just needs to tap the English button on the menu bar and the full English text of the page is displayed. It&#8217;s really easy to use. Also, a bookmark can be placed at any time so that you can return to that spot later by tapping bookmarks in the menu.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to Talmud</strong></p>
<p>Many people prefer to have a teacher guide them through the Talmud. iTalmud English Edition has a full library of audio lectures on every page of the Talmud. The classes are taught by <a href="http://www.dafyomi.org/aboutrg.php" target="_blank">Rav Dovid Grossman</a>, an accomplished Rebbe in Yeshiva Gedola of Los Angeles. His explanations are clear and concise and make learning Talmud easier and interesting. The classes are downloaded to your iPhone but stay within the app so you can listen while you read along on using any of the three ways to read Talmud.</p>
<p><strong>Search</strong></p>
<p>Type any Hebrew or Aramaic word into the search box and you will get a comprehensive list of where that word is found in the Talmud. Tap on any of the pages listed and it will take you to that page and the word your searched will be highlighted. This is really a great tool if you are preparing a dvar Torah or just can&#8217;t recall the exact page of a Talmudic passage you remember. One limitation of the search is that the results are limited. So when I searched for a fairly common term, the results ended after 3 tractates. Hopefully, this is something that can be addressed in a later version.</p>
<p><strong>Daf Yomi</strong></p>
<p>All around the world, people study Talmud. There is a universal folio a day cycle called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daf_Yomi" target="_blank">Daf Yomi</a>. In almost any city with Jewish people studying Talmud one can find lectures on that day&#8217;s stduy. With iTalmud English Edition the location of those lectures is easy to find. iTalmud English Edition will give you as much information as possible. Details include time, location, phone number, teacher and language. A vital tool to folio a day students around the world, iTalmud English Edition, will help you find a lecture near you.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I give iTalmud English Edition 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, a gold medal, whatever. It is a really impressive iPhone app. The price is right too. At $25 you can have the entire Talmud in your pocket &#8211; 4 ways! Compare that with a print Talmud which will run anywhere from $150 to $1500. The app gives you everything you need to study Talmud at home or on the road. Kudos to the developers at Crowded Road for providing us with such a great app at such a great price. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=326474560&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">Buy it now at the iTunes App Store</a>. <em>Check out </em><a href="http://www.crowdedroad.com" target="_blank"><em>Crowded Road&#8217;s other apps and services on their website</em></a><em>.</em></p>

I have cross posted this post there as well. <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/09/essay-oral-law-in-judaism.html" target="_blank">Head over there for more discussion.</a></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #808080;">What follows is my understanding of The Oral Law and its transmission to us. This article does not attempt to validate or prove its transmission as fact, rather it explains just what is being transmitted when we refer to Torah SheBaal Peh (TSBP).</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #808080;">I am sure there are plenty of maamarei Chazal that are not 100% congruent with this approach. I am also sure that there are many maamarei Chazal that do jive with this approach. I have spent many hours studying and analyzing the concept of TSBP and what follows is what I believe to be a rational, coherent, non-apologetic approach.<span id="more-1108"></span><br />
</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #808080;">Much of this essay is accessible<span style="color: #808080;"> in </span><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/18/structure-and-philosophy-of-torah-3-connections-5409/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #808080;">audio format by clicking here</span></a><span style="color: #808080;">.</span></span></em></p>
<p>The Torah preceded the world. One tradition tell us that God looked into the Torah and created the world. That means that the Torah contains within it the spiritual genetic code of the world and the world is a physical manifestation of that code. Another metaphor would be a blueprint. All the information necessary to build is in the blueprint, yet it is merely ink and paper. What can this mean? God looked at the stories of Adam and Eve and created the world? Or God looked at the sale of Joseph and created the word? Impossible. The metaphor does not even make sense. I believe Chazal are telling us that Torah is not the stories or even laws in the Chumash. &#8220;Torah&#8221; refers to the all encompassing Oral Law (this idea is attributed to Rambam). In other words, the Oral Law refers to the natural and supernatural rules of the universe that manifested themselves in a physical sense once God put them into motion during &#8220;Creation&#8221;.</p>
<p>What this means is that the Torah and our universe are really two sides of one coin. The spiritual code on one side and the physical manifestation on the other side. Thus, someone could potentially rewrite the spiritual code by examining the physical manifestation side. Just as with a blueprint, a talented architect could possibly rewrite a blueprint by examining a building a talented spiritualist would be capable of figuring out the spiritual code the world is made of.</p>
<p>This spiritual code contains within it the natural rules of our universe and some of those rules are recommended limitations on human activity designed to help a person maximize their existence in the world. In this light, the Torah is a guide that gives the physical world its characteristics and contains the instructions for living in that world.</p>
<p>A few individuals were in tune with this reality and implemented some of the Torah&#8217;s concepts into their lives. Shem, Ever, Noach and Enosh were a few of the first people who were able to glean spiritual rules from their observations of the world.</p>
<p>Abraham was the first to grasp enough of the code for God to choose him to begin a nation of people to whom God would eventually charge with keeping and teaching this code. Slowly, Abraham taught these concepts to whomever would listen. The Abrahamic family was also aware of these Torah rules and whether they kept them or not is not relevant. They knew them and may have practiced them.</p>
<p>Upon Abraham&#8217;s family being enslaved in Egypt, the concepts and their rules became more and more forgotten. The exodus occurred just before the point of no return. The point that Chazal call the 49th level of impurity. The slaves were just as Egyptian as their slave-masters save for 3 (or 4) areas. Such, a large nation of people would need a guide book to remind them of their Abrahamic, monotheistic, Torah tradition. The Bnei Yisrael left Egypt for the sole purpose of receiving these instructions in the form of the Torah.</p>
<p>At Sinai, God gave Moses the entire code. This code included the spiritual rules, the laws, the stories (which all contain important moral and quasi-historical lessons) as well as all the information necessary to live according to those laws. God then gave Moses a written version of notes to this code. These notes were the bare minimum necessary to reconstruct the entire code as God gave it to Moses.</p>
<p>At this point, Moses has all the information in his head and gives the people this written book of notes that we call the Written Law or Torah SheBiksav (TSBK). As time progresses Moses added (probably divinely inspired) notes to the end of the TSBK to complete the books. The Jewish people try to live a lifestyle as Moses taught them according to the code and had the notes in TSBK to help them remember their obligations. As we are taught at the start of Ethics of our Fathers, Moses &#8220;kibbel&#8221; (received) the &#8220;Torah&#8221; (including the TSBP) (and again this does not mean the Chumash, why would there need to be a mesora for that if it was written) and gave it all to Joshua, who gave it to the elders etc. There was a central Torah authority who could resolve disputes. Originally, it was a one man show starring Moses. But at the behest of Jethro, some delegation gave Torah authority to others. There was no machlokes (disagreement) among the Torah authority as Moses could always be consulted to give them the truth.</p>
<p>The system was designed to ensure that there would be a transmission from parent to child and teacher to student. This guaranteed the Torah would remain a &#8220;living&#8221; Torah and not relegated to a library. Codifying the bare minimum in text form forced the Jewish people to rely on a system of relationships and living the life of Torah to remember all its laws. This is an integral part of the Oral Transmission that has stood the test of time, as we shall see.</p>
<p>This system remained in place throughout the 1st Temple. A central Torah authority was the final arbiter of disputes and there was no machlokes as to what Moses claimed God wanted the Jewish people to do in their service of God.</p>
<p>Many called this entire concept into question. Korach, Yeravam and others wished to undermine the Mosaic Torah authority. But it always existed.</p>
<p>During the Second Temple, due to oppression it was literally impossible to maintain a central Torah authority. Torah study was banned, Torah scholars were killed and Yeshivas were disbanded. Students began taking notes to ensure TSBP would be remembered.</p>
<p>In a revolutionary move, Rabbi Yehuda HaNassi collected many of these notebooks and canonized a version of TSBP notes called the Mishna. He too, followed the Mosaic formula of writing just the bare minimum necessary for a scholar to recreate the code from the Mishna. He wrote the Mishnayos in a format that would induce questions and those questions would in turn produce the TSBP tradition. He was successful to an extent. But due to the increased hostility and lack of central Torah authority disputes were common. R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi completely succeeded in the broader goal of maintaining the need for the parent to child, teacher to student relationship to transmit TSBP.</p>
<p>Mishnaic literature was discussed, argued and taught for a couple hundred years. Students continued taking notes and eventually these notes became the Talmud. Ravina and Rav Ashi collected these notes and recorded these conversations to canonize the understanding of the Mishna in order to recreate the entire code. Although to a lesser degree, they also made an effort to be concise and include only the discussion necessary for recreating the method of Jewish life briefly described in the Mishna that was based on the written notes of the Chumash that God gave to Moses. Their brevity, once again maintained the familiar generation to generation connection that TSBP demands.</p>
<p>Since the closing of the Talmud it has been discussed and argued vociferously. This is a good thing. It gives its scholars the chance they need to arrive at the truth. TSBP is not their discussions, it is what they are discussing. TSBP was given to the Jewish people at Sinai but in truth it exists all around us. It is the rules of nature and spirituality that govern our world. Distant cultures and tribes can come to similar conclusions as the Torah because they are examining the world that is the physical manifestation of that Torah. People who never heard of Torah can relate to many of its laws as they seem natural to them. In fact they are natural to the world.</p>
<p>In conclusion, when we say that Moses received Torah SheBaal Peh, what we mean is that Moses had all the information necessary to live and appreciate the Torah lifestyle. The Written Torah were the original notes to this information as time progresses, we now have Mishanic and Talmudic notes as well. Thus, our study of Talmud today continues the Oral Transmission of TSBP as we attempt to decode the original version of the Oral Law handed from God to Moses on Sinai. Today, our greatest resource to that end is the study of Talmud.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear &#8211; <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/08/mesira-informant-in-jewish-law.html" target="_blank">more discussion there</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p>The topic of mesira is complex. I do not claim expertise on the subject of who is a moser, but I have heard a discourse from an expert on Jewish and American Law named <a href="http://www.wsat.org/therav.htm" target="_blank">Rabbi Breitowitz</a>. Aside from teaching law at University of Maryland, Rabbi Breitowitz is a practicing Rabbi in Silver Spring Maryland. When I lived in Baltimore, I heard Rabbi Breitowitz speak on the topic of mesira and I was able to find the same speech online to refresh my memory.</p>
<p>This is my basic understanding of his take on mesira.<span id="more-1000"></span></p>
<p>He mentions three contemporary positions, Reb Moshe Feinstein, the Aruch HaShulchan and Rav Wosner.</p>
<p>He begins with Reb Moshe. Reb Moshe holds that there is a prohibition of mesira when the secular punishment is worse than the Torah&#8217;s punishment. A moser has a halachic status of a rodef, one who is trying to kill another, and must be stopped from his mesira. There are 3 big exceptions. 1) When the person about whom the moser is speaking of is a rodef himself. This is because a person who kills a rodef is not a killer nor is his act of attempting to kill the rodef is not considered a rodef. As an aside, a sexual or physical abuser is considered a halachic rodef and thus there is no prohibition of mesira in those situations. 2) If the moser is preventing a major communal disaster then there is no prohibition. 3) If it one&#8217;s job to inform, then mesira will not apply.</p>
<p>This is the most narrow view of when one is permitted to be moser that Rabbi Breitowitz mentions.</p>
<p>The Aruch Hashulchan says in a footnote to section 318 in Choshen Mishpat that in a benevolent and fair country where there is a justice system that does not unfairly imprison Jews, one is not guilty of mesira by informing the government of a fellow Jew&#8217;s crimes. He continues by saying &#8220;for example in wonderful Czarist Russia&#8221;. There is a question as to the seriousness of this footnote as he could not have possibly meant that Czarist Russia was fair and benevolent. The question is whether the entire footnote has value or if the entire thing was a false gesture of good faith to the Czar. It is not likely that the Aruch Hashulchan would add a deliberately misleading footnote and the reasoning of his footnote stands whether his country was wonderful or not. Thus, the Tzitz Eliezer holds that the Aruch Hashulchan means that wherever there is a &#8220;procedural justice&#8221; there is no mesira.</p>
<p>The third opinion is that of Rav Wosner. His approach integrates the rules of dina d&#8217;malchusa dina with mesira. His reasoning is that when the non-Jews follow the Noachide law of creating a set of laws it becomes a halachic basis for the Jew to obey those laws. Thus, he concludes that it cannot be possible to violate the prohibition of mesira if one is following the laws of their country. Since, he must follow the laws of that country his mesira is not against halacha. This does not mean one is required to be a moser, rather the reporting is not a violation of mesira.</p>
<p>It is necessary to define when dina d&#8217;milchusa dina constitutes to determine when mesira is not prohibited according to Rav Wosner. The Mechaber says that dina d&#8217;malchusa dina is limited to government interests. The Rama disagrees and says that it applies to anything that is designed to promote the well being of society. Most poskim agree with this definition which includes but is not limited to, criminal law, minimum wage laws, environmental laws and child labor laws.</p>
<p>In conclusion, mesira is a term bandied about to protect our own criminals. In reality, it is very difficult to pin down a halachic moser according to the Aruch Hashulchan or Rav Wosner and although it is possible according to Reb Moshe to be a moser it is still unlikely. We need to be honest with ourselves and stop hiding behind archaic halachic terms to justify false ideas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week the world witnessed another wonder of our universe, the Solar Eclipse. This eclipse was visible from Southeast Asia and was the longest eclipse in 18 years and will remain the longest for the next 123 years.</p>
<p>The eclipse has long been associated with mythology and supernatural acts. If you are a fan of the TV show, <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Heroes/" target="_blank">Heroes</a>, you know what I mean.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iX8d-T09U9BY--80N9QWImFwW2ewD99JN2T01" target="_blank">many Hindus were gripped by fear</a>. According to Hindu  tradition, the eclipse can cause harm to unborn children. Many ancient cultures attached mythological meaning to solar eclipses. Today, we know that the eclipse is part of the solar pattern that is predictable to the second.</p>
<p>What about Judaism? What do we say about the solar eclipse?</p>
<p><span id="more-894"></span>The Talmud in Sukkah (29a) gives us a clue.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><em>The Rabbis taught: </em><span style="font-weight:normal;"><em>An account of four things the sun is [eclipsed]: An improperly eulogized head of Jewish court, a betrothed girl who is raped and her cries go unheeded, [&#8230;], and two brothers killed on one day.</em></span></strong></p></blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">What in the world does this mean?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight:normal;">Is this more mythology? </span></strong></p>
<p>The 19th Century German Torah Scholar, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Ettlinger" target="_blank">Yaakov Etlinger</a>, writes in his Aruch L&#8217;Ner, that the Talmudic Rabbis certainly knew eclipses were natural phenomena running their course. (He proves this with inferences from within the text which are too tedious and lost in translation to English). It is similar to what Nachmanadies writes with regard to the Biblical promise after the Great Flood that God would not flood the world again, and he sealed the promise with the rainbow. Of course, the rainbow always existed, it is a natural phenomena. Nachmanadies explains that the rainbow is a sign, a reminder to us and in a different sense to God that He made a promise never to destroy His world again.</p>
<p>Simililarly, when a solar eclipse occurs and the light is temporarily removed from the physical world we are reminded of the moral implications of a dark world. A world in which good leaders are quickly forgotten, women are treated as objects and blood is spilled within one family, is a world of darkness.</p>
<p>When we see the eclipse we are to remember that it is our job as human beings to bring light into our world. The light of morality, mindfulness and sensitivity will protect our society from these terrible social ills mentioned in Sukkah. It is important to recognize what a world we would have if there was no moral light. If our world was thrust into spiritual darkness just as the physical world is thrust into sudden solar darkness during an eclipse our world would be quite different. Seeing this occur in the natural world &#8220;enlightens&#8221; us to provide that light and prevent the spiritual darkness from overcoming the light.</p>
<p>I think it is absolutely magnificent to live a life where we find meaning and messages from every part of our lives. A life where each moment makes a difference and each of our choices can change the world.</p>
<p>Equally magnificent is the sheer physical beauty of the solar eclipse.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this post. In appreciation I have provided some of the best footage (seen on NYTimes.com) of last week&#8217;s eclipse. Enjoy it &#8211; you deserve it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a really interesting column this week.</p>
<p>Whenever I find a <em>convergence</em> of ideas between the Legal field and Torah I get excited.</p>
<p>This time I found a <em>divergence</em>. Not quite as exciting, but very interesting.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/us/26bar.html?_r=1&amp;src=twt&amp;amp;twt=nytimes" target="_blank">NY Times followed up</a> on a study conducted a few years ago by a 2nd year <a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/" target="_blank">Georgetown Law School </a>Student.</p>
<p>The study was groundbreaking. It focused on the amount of questions from the Judges to lawyers and its effect on the outcome of cases.<span id="more-714"></span></p>
<p>It turns out that there is almost a direct correlation between the number of questions the lawyers are asked and the decision of the Supreme Court. Over a five year period , the party that was asked more questions <em>lost</em> <strong>86% of the time</strong>.</p>
<p>That is a lot. Some of it can be attributed to the Justices attempting to find holes in the weaker arguments. Most cases at the Supreme Court level are very gray areas. The side that is weaker will be exposed by more questions, thus the Judges use the questions to poke holes in the less compelling argument.</p>
<p>On the other hand, getting the Judges to ask your opponent more questions will help you win as well.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that the Judges, by asking questions, are attempting to show their colleagues the flaws in the arguments.</p>
<p>In fact a new, more comprehensive study found:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“The more attention justices pay to a side,” said Timothy R. Johnson, who teaches law and political science at the University of Minnesota and is one of the new study’s authors, “the more likely that side is to lose.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>This week is the Jewish holiday of Shavuos. A day where Jews around the world celebrate the giving of the Torah to the world. To this very day , Torah is studied in depth. Its ideas are discussed and argued.</p>
<p>The greatest arena for this study is the Talmud. The Talmud is a collection of legal analysis of Jewish Law. It is also a lot more thant that, but the purpose of the book is to develop a high level understanding of Jewish Law.</p>
<p>I find it very interesting that the Talmud asks tons on questions. It is not a law book. It is a book of questions. Invariably the side of the law with more questions will help the Talmud get closer to the truth. Questions do not indicate weakness. Good questions provoke better answers and better understanding. The side that has<em> better </em>answers emerges as the true path.</p>
<p>This holds true for all of Judaism. We encourage questions. We provoke discussion. We want to get closer to truth. The path to the truth is paved with questions.</p>
<p>When in the Supreme Court, questions prove fatal. In Judaism they are a necessary component to finding the true path.</p>
<p>On this blog I have an &#8220;<a href="http://finkorswim.com/ask-the-rabbi/" target="_blank">Ask the Rabbi</a>&#8221; Section. I encourage questions. If you have any, just click. I will try to answer as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>

<p>Our discussion ranged from history of the Jewish people, the connection between the spiritual and material world, astrology and much, much more.</p>

		<itunes:summary>This week &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Connections&lt;/a&gt; was the first of a series of classes about the history, philosophy, structure and benefits to Torah study.

In preparation for Shavuos, when the Jewish people accepted the Torah, this was the perfect time to begin the series.

This class is the foundation for the next few classes so I highly recommend checking it out. The reviews of the class were great and we hope more people will join us next week.

Our discussion ranged from history of the Jewish people, the connection between the spiritual and material world, astrology and much, much more.

Looking forward to next week. See you there (or here).
