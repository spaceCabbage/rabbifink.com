				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6878" alt="trust_action" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/trust_action-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" />The latest twist in the Doheny Kosher Meats scandal is that Shlomo Yehuda Rechnitz, a well known community activist and philanthropist will be buying the butcher shop. He will keep the store from closing down in the wake of the scandal and it is expected that the RCC will reissue their supervision on the store under its new ownership.</p>
<p>The key to this resurrection will be that the quality we have come to expect from Doheny Meats will be maintained and the steady flow of kosher meat will continue from the area&#8217;s largest provider of kosher meat.</p>
<p>This is great news for the consumers of Los Angeles. Our community is blessed to have a man with the magnanimous nature of Shlomo Yehuda Rechnitz. Stepping into this mess is a  wonderful gesture, the likes of which the LA community is accustomed to because we have been spoiled by Shlomo Yehuda Rechnitz.</p>
<p>There are many people who would only buy kosher meat if it was of the quality that is found at Doheny and losing the shop completely would have likely resulted in fewer people observing kosher laws. Keeping the store open is huge for this reason alone. But additionally, it is imperative that the flow of meat continue unabated to avoid a major shortage and price escalations. For the Jewish people of Los Angeles who keep kosher.<span id="more-6877"></span></p>
<p>For Mike Engleman, soon to be former owner of Doheny Kosher Meats, it is a pretty sweet compromise. He will lose his business, but he will be paid for it. He might be hated and villified by many members of the community, but he gets out of a tought situation all while keeping some face and some cash. It could have been much worse for him.</p>
<p>However, there is something that does concern me a bit.</p>
<p>The RCC will not give a hechsher to Doheny if it is owned by Engleman. On the one hand, this is reasonable. Mike has no credibility and might try to pull similar shenanigans again if given the opportunity. The RCC does not owe him a hechsher. They can supervise whom they choose to supervise. If they choose to supervise Rechnitz, they are certainly within their rights to do so.</p>
<p>The minor issue I have is twofold. First of all, I wish that we could just give hechsherim to food, not to people. It seems to me that the butcher is just a mechanical actor. His role is to provide the meat. The supervisor&#8217;s role is to make sure the meat is kosher. I don&#8217;t love the idea that the meat can be technically kosher, but we won&#8217;t supervise the meat and give it our approval because the butcher is a bad guy. I can hear it, but I don&#8217;t love it.</p>
<p>What really gets me is that the RCC is saying that they can no longer trust Engleman. That&#8217;s the rub. They never should have to trust him or anyone they supervise. Their job is <em>not</em> to trust their clients. They must be vigilant and super skeptical about everyone. The fact that their mashgiach was not doing his job and this enabled crooked behavior only proves that we need more and better supervision. From their perspective it seems like they think they need to trust their clients. No! They need to distrust their clients! They shouldn&#8217;t decline to supervise because they don&#8217;t trust someone. The reason we need the RCC to supervise is because we <em>don&#8217;t </em>trust purveyors of kosher food <em>unless</em> they are supervised.</p>
<p>After the Monsey kosher scandal few, if any, improvements were made to the kashrus system in place. They went into the scandal with the attitude that we can trust people who look and act frum and they left the scandal the same way.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if the only public improvement following this scandal was frummer owners of butcher shops. We need better supervision too. Ideally we should be able to trust one another. When it comes to religious law, we say &#8220;one witness is believed&#8221; &#8211; even an involved witness. But kashrus is no longer about religious law. It has become big business. In business we always require two witnesses. To me, this means we should step up the level of supervision and not rely on &#8220;trust&#8221; no matter who the person is that we are trusting.</p>
<p>So while I absolutely concede that the RCC has the right to supervise whomever they choose at their discretion, it concerns me that they seem to express their unwillingness to supervise a shop owned by Engleman simply because they cannot trust him. They can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t trust anybody. That&#8217;s why we need them to do the important job they are doing.</p>
