				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The term Rationalist Judaism has been clanking around the Internet and Orthodox Jewish conversation for a while now. It’s not quite a movement, but there are some very strong contemporary voices behind Rationalist Judaism. Many people think the term is an oxymoron. Others think it is intellectually dishonest. Yet others think it is heresy. But without a working definition or at least a framework to understand what we are talking about, any conversation about Rationalist Judaism will result in people talking past one another and miscommunication.<span id="more-7938"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7939" alt="Thinking-Man-Rodin" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin-600x381.jpg" /></a>First, to address the complaint that calling one brand of Judaism “Rationalist” is insulting or offensive to everyone else. It sure seems like the term is implying that everyone else is irrational. This is not the correct implication. Rationalist Judaism is not to the exclusion of irrationality. Instead it is to exclusion of supernaturalism. That’s not to say that mysticism is inherently irrational either. Maybe it is for some. These are just the words that are used to describe two different approaches to God and Judaism. Words are often cumbersome and imprecise. That is the case here. We don’t mean to say Rationalist Judaism is rational and everyone else is irrational.</p>
<p>In general, rationalism literally means to use reason above all else. In this view, truth can be deduced and is not subject to fallacies like appeals to authority or <em>argumentum ad populum</em>. Obviously, a religious person maintains some belief in authority and relies on some subjective baseline truths that cannot be logically argued. But we are not talking about pure rationalism. We are talking about Rationalist Judaism.</p>
<p>I believe that term Rationalist Judaism was adapted from the term Theistic Rationalism. Both groups share some common principles. The basic idea of both groups is to release theology from supernaturalism and focus on morality. To the extent that supernaturalism can be justifiably removed from religion, Rationalist Judaism holds it should be removed. That is all Rationalist Judaism really means.</p>
<p>There are several heroes and champions of this concept, none greater than Rambam. In his halachic and philosophical works, Rambam sought to eliminate superstition, mysticism, and supernaturalism from Judaism to the greatest extent possible. One overriding theme of his works is that there is nothing supernatural other than God. Giving power to charms, incantations, or even angels is akin to idol worship. He held that belief in God was logical. He held that prophecy was a natural result of perfection. He held that God rarely intervenes with nature. He held that <em>Mitzvos</em> have material benefits for the person who performs the Mitzvah. He held that astrology was bunk. He held that God conformed the Torah to the needs of mankind. He held that <em>Maaseh Breishis</em> was science. He held that <em>Maaseh </em><em>Merkava</em>h was metaphysics. There is not a single mystical idea mentioned in any of his books. It’s as if there is no such thing as mysticism in Rambam’s universe.</p>
<p>Some have tried to argue that Rambam was a mystic and obscured his true views. This has been thoroughly debunked by many great scholars and if you are of this mind, I direct you to this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906764158" target="_blank">Maimonides’ Confrontation with Mysticism</a></p>
<p>There are many other examples of great Torah authorities who used similar principles in their halachic, or philosophical, or exegetical works. R’ Samson Raphael Hirsch wrote Horeb, a book of the philosophy of <em>mitzvos</em> without a single kabbalistic reference. The entire book makes sense of Torah Judaism and it all works even if one rejects mysticism.</p>
<p>Ralbag is another. His commentary on Chumash literally reinterprets examples of supernatural events into metaphors or visions instead of real life occurrences. His worldview fit this same broad category. To the extent that supernaturalism could be excised from Torah and Judaism, he saw to it that they were.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Rationalist Judaism. It’s a tradition that has a long and powerful chain of great Torah luminaries who lived by this philosophy.</p>
<p>Another important element of Rationalist Judaism is that because God’s intervention and communication with man is so limited, the Mesorah and Holy texts of Judaism are more subject to error than one who believes that God ensures the truth of everything. In the opposing view, God’s essence permeates the writings of men like the great Talmudic scholars known as Chazal. Thus, their writings are presumed to be free of mistakes or misjudgments. Rationalist Judaism holds that the best efforts of man can still result in error. This is especially true in matters that are not Torah specific. We refer here to math, science, history, medicine, and other disciplines not directly related to Torah. However, even if Chazal were to err in issues of halacha or Torah specific interpretation, it would not matter as they have the authority to establish the laws for the Jewish people.</p>
<p>It’s true that this sort of thinking led many people to conclusions that we would reject today. Rambam himself was of the belief that God’s existence is provable. Rambam also thought Aristotelian philosophy and science were as true as God’s word in the Torah. We know that both of these are actually untrue. Does this mean that Rationalist Judaism is wrong? Of course not.</p>
<p>In fact, only someone whose paradigm is that Torah authorities are infallible would argue that by disproving Aristotle the entire worldview of Rambam is incorrect. But the paradigm of Rationalist Judaism does not allow for this sort of thinking. People do err, only God is infallible. So Rambam dealt with truth in the same way Chazal dealt with truth. That is, they were subject to the thinking and common beliefs of their time. We are also subject to the thinking and common beliefs of our time. Therefore, we are also supposed to look at Torah through the prism of modern thinking. No one actually pretends that Rambam was a Modern Orthodox Jew of 2013 America. But his worldview is one that allows, or even requires, using contemporary thinking to build one’s Jewish life. That’s what Chazal did and that is what Rambam did and that is what we are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Rambam is not making the claim that Chazal and the prophets before them lived and believed the same way he believed. Rather he is making the argument that with the same information available to Rambam they would have drawn the same conclusions as Rambam. Further, he demonstrates that so much of what they did say is compatible with his Aristotelian, Islamic influenced philosophy. However, even if they would have not reached the same conclusions, they would have used all the available information and evidence to formulate their views. That is what Rationalist Judaism attempts to do as it has always attempted to do.</p>
<p>But what’s the point of all this? Isn’t it obvious that there are supernatural forces and that Judaism believes in mysticism?</p>
<p>The answer to this very serious question is that Rambam held that these were all corruptions. In his view, true Judaism does not have any of the trappings of a supernaturalist cult. God is supernatural, a few miracles that were necessary for the birth of our nation occurred in Biblical times, but other than that, Judaism is a religion that is supposed to be hyper-focused on the practical matters of personal growth and emulating God in our lives.</p>
<p>Sure, many great people introduced mystical or supernatural elements into Judaism. Most people believe in them too. But in Rambam’s view, these are human additions and emendations. They are not integral to serving God, and may in fact harm our service of God.</p>
<p>For someone who believes in the supernatural and mystical this all sounds crazy. That’s fine. However, not everyone is predisposed to believing in things that they can’t see or prove. Those people may still be willing to suspend their disbelief or skepticism and believe in God or even in Divine Revelation. However, if they are not required to believe in mysticism and its trappings of Zoharic and Lurianic kabbalism, the ties to astrology, the use of charms and <em>segulos</em>, the existence of demons, the belief that human beings can be infallible, the idea that Chazal had access to modern science (but didn’t tell everyone about penicillin), that God still communicates with humans (but only to Orthodox Jews), and many other beliefs that require active supernaturalism and a healthy dose of non-skepticism, then why should they believe in those things? Further, if they were required to believe in these things, would it surprise us if they rejected the entire package? No, it would not. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/16/judaism-of-the-future-my-response-to-klal-perspectives-spring-2012/" target="_blank">Judaism of the Future: My Response to Klal Perspectives Spring 2012</a>)</p>
<p>Rationalist Judaism is a real thing. It’s not a fantasy. It’s not a boogeyman that seeks to demonize those who believe in supernatural Judaism. It’s an alternative for people who are more skeptical. It’s a way of serving God without being forced to believe in an entire universe that stretches beyond what is acceptable in their view. There are other side benefits to this perspective. Some of them have already been discussed on this and other blogs. One of those benefits will be the subject of a future post.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that one can practice Orthodox Judaism and love God and make a Kiddush Hashem without mysticism. It still works. Perhaps it even works better. But no matter how one practices their Judaism, it is wise to establish both views as viable options. In this way, we can ensure that the personality types that are drawn to mysticism and skepticism have a place in Orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Last summer, The Jewish Action featured a panel of experts answering the &#8220;tough questions.&#8221; One of the panelists was the great Rabbi Lawrence (Leib) Kelemen of Neve and Mussar Vaad fame. The question he was asked was: &#8220;Why are so many kids off the Derech?&#8221; (That&#8217;s their term. I don&#8217;t use it.)</p>
<p>Rabbi Kelemen starts off great. He says that kids don&#8217;t leave Orthodox Judaism because of a cell phone or the Internet or even because they never experience the beauty of Shabbos. He even says that secular courses at college are not the problem.<span id="more-7890"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10142436.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7891" alt="10142436" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10142436-600x427.jpg" /></a>Then he cites the research of the two foremost Orthodox therapists who deal with these issues in a paper published 15 years ago:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;First, there are child risk factors, such as attention deficit disorder (ADD), hyperactivity, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), learning disabilities, poor academic abilities, poor social skills and depression. Second, there are environmental risk factors, which include major medical or economic crises, corrupt rabbis and teachers, sexual abuse, physical abuse, lack of recognition of individual strengths and Internet abuse. Third, there are family risk factors, which include hypercritical or angry home environments, parents with poor parenting skills and lack of shalom bayis.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>But Rabbi Kelemen says that the only real cause in this list compiled by professionals in the field, is the home. Forget the first two reasons mentioned in the paper. Basically, the real problem is bad parenting. He calls it parental selfishness.</p>
<p>He then discusses some other very important points and critiques of frum culture including: The emotional cost of being a frum Jew, teaching Mitzvos without appreciation for Mitzvos, the Shidduch system meat market, and overall misplaced values. These are all excellent points.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I didn&#8217;t love how Rabbi Kelemen latched on to one particular reason for kids leaving Orthodox Judaism and in essence blaming the parents, it was a pretty decent article. Made some good points, fell a little flat in others.</p>
<p>Apparently, not everyone saw it this way. It seems an avalanche of letters arrived in The Jewish Action mailboxes criticizing Rabbi Kelemen&#8217;s take on the issue. They sensed that Rabbi Kelemen was being too hard on parents of children who had left Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Rabbi Kelemen responds in the current Winter 2013 issue of The Jewish Action. He basically doubles down on his theory, and not only that, he expresses regret that he left wiggle room for anyone to think that the parents did not cause the child to leave Orthodox Judaism. In fairness, a letter from a third professional (this is in addition to the two cited in the 2013 article) lends some support to his theory that the parents are to blame, but the context of the letter was to answer a specific question, not to address the general issue.</p>
<p>He also cites R&#8217; Chaim Kanievsky who says that if the parents fought in the home then the children cannot be blamed for rebelling. This too, does not address the issue head on, it simply exculpates children from difficult homes from Heavenly Justice. Finally, he quotes R&#8217; Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg who said that almost every child who is struggling with their religion is seeking attention they could not get at home from their bad parents.</p>
<p>This response disturbs me.</p>
<p>First of all, I respect R&#8217; Chaim Kanievsky, but I don&#8217;t think he is in a position to offer specific advice on this specific issue. I could be wrong, but I do not think that he has experience with formerly Orthodox Jews in any meaningful sense. I simply have never heard of him being involved with these kids. Other Gedolim have such experience. I don&#8217;t believe R&#8217; Chaim is one of them. So while his thoughts are interesting and worth hearing, I don&#8217;t see how his oblique statement should be taken more seriously than experts in the field. The same goes for R&#8217; Scheinberg.</p>
<p>Second of all, I don&#8217;t like the assumption that there is a common or specific reason that people leave Orthodox Judaism which implies that without some sort of trauma or disability they would not leave. People leave for tons of reasons. And many people leave for intellectual or social reasons despite charmed childhoods. It&#8217;s arrogant to think we can turn every born Orthodox Jew into an adult Orthodox Jew. It just doesn&#8217;t work for some people. We have to acknowledge that possibility in any discussion of the topic.</p>
<p>Third of all, because there are completely healthy people who leave Orthodox Judaism, it&#8217;s obvious that not all of them are scarred by bad parenting. Most children of bad parents actually don&#8217;t leave Orthodox Judaism. Conversely, we all know excellent parents who have children who left Orthodox Judaism. The blame game here is silly and tired.</p>
<p>I remember when the Jewish Observer article on this phenomenon was released in the 90&#8242;s. The parents blamed the schools, the schools blamed the parents, the professionals blamed mental health issues, and the teens didn&#8217;t blame anything. I heard from rabbis who attended the Nefesh conferences in those days that the sessions were basically arguing over who was to blame.</p>
<p>Has it never occurred to people that not everyone is going to be frum? Has it ever occurred to people that some people just don&#8217;t get anything from Orthodox Judaism. Yesterday, I wrote about an heir to a Chasidic dynasty that did not feel comfortable in his religious environment. If not for an external factor, he may have left Orthodox Judaism too. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/26/book-review-untold-tales-of-the-hasidim/">Book Review | Untold Tales of the Hasidim</a>). The author of that book <a href="http://unpious.com/2012/05/interview-with-professor-david-assaf/" target="_blank">said in an interview</a> that he was raised Orthodox, but just never felt or believed in God so he stopped practicing. It&#8217;s not always something other than that! I recently talked with a young man who left Orthodox Judaism about his journey. I asked him when he felt like he was no longer Orthodox. He told me that he never actually felt Orthodox. Throughout his years of school he kind of just breezed right through it and knew in his head that when high school yeshiva was over, he was going to leave. No trauma, no mental illness, no story. Just left. He&#8217;s not the only one.</p>
<p>When the question of &#8220;Why are so many kids off the Derech?&#8221; is asked, the only proper response in my opinion, is to say that each kid has their own reason and each kid has their own story and each kid has their own choice to stay or to go.</p>
<p>People would like to identify trends so that fewer born Orthodox Jews leave. If the reasons for their flight are understood, the thinking is that the community can reform its behavior and as a result more people will stay Orthodox. Unfortunately, this is a game of whack-a-mole. There are too many reasons and too many factors to effectively keep everyone in the fold.</p>
<p>However, there is something that can be universally implemented. Many teens or young adults experiment with a life outside the confines of Orthodox Judaism. Some people call these kids &#8220;at-risk&#8221;. How we treat these kids is very likely to impact their loyalties as they grow older. If we marginalize them, infantilize them, insult them, hurt them, hate them, or judge them we are likely sealing their fate. So while I don&#8217;t think we can possibly control all the factors that might push someone to leave Orthodox Judaism, we can adjust our attitude toward people who are on the margins. They must be made to feel comfortable, loved, accepted, important, smart, and capable of contributing positively to the community. That is something we can control and it is something that should be done regardless of whether it will keep more people Orthodox. But I have a feeling it would help the numbers too.</p>
<p>Finally, I do think there is a bit of a silver lining here. If frum people really think that mental illness, and learning disabilities, or even ADD is a huge factor in kids leaving Orthodox Judaism and that a peaceful home is of utmost importance to keeping kids frum and that we should instill positive Judaism in our education system in order that more people appreciate the beauty of Orthodox Judaism so they will want to stay Orthodox, go for it! I think it&#8217;s a bit disappointing that we would only seem to address these issues as a way to prevent people from leaving Orthodox Judaism, but if that&#8217;s what gets people exciting about solving these problems, I am all for it. I would prefer if these challenges were addressed simply because they are important issues on their own, but sometimes people need superficial motivation to do the right thing. At the very least we can justify putting more resources into solving these very real problems for the sake of all the people who are affecting by them, not just the kids who are at risk of leaving Orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Limmud is a pluralistic Jewish organization that organizes learning conferences for Jewish people all over the world. Limmud London is a very large gathering and for the first time ever, it is being attended by the new Chief Rabbi of England, Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis. This has set off a controversy. Many charedi rabbis have prohibited their constituents from attending Limmud and are urging Rabbi Mirvis to renege on his commitment to attend.  A very important discussion within the Orthodox Jewish community has ensued.<span id="more-7860"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/limmud.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7862" alt="limmud" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/limmud-600x356.png" /></a>Rabbi Nathan Lopes Cardozo defends the position of the Chief Rabbi in the Jerusalem Post. His argument is mostly that Limmud is a tremendous opportunity to showcase the beauty of Orthodox Judaism to the world and instead of taking that opportunity, they have handed it off to non-Orthodox Jews. Jonathan Rosenblum defends the charedi position in an article on Cross-Currents. His argument can be summarized as a reaffirmation that attending events with non-Orthodox Jews is the wrong forum for teaching Torah. He bases this on two assumptions. One is that Limmud is not serious about learning because they have too many fluffy sessions like &#8220;50 Shades of Hummus&#8221; and a drumming workshop. The second assumption is that something bad will happen if Orthodox rabbis attend a pluralistic event. He does not mention this in his article, but it is the underlying assumption here. Without making this assumption, his argument about the forum not be serious enough is flailing in a soft breeze.</p>
<p>Rabbi Adlerstein adeptly attacks this assumption in his latest article on Cross-Currents.</p>
<p>The assumption is not necessarily based on facts, evidence, or reason. It is based on a rabbinic proclamation issued 58 years ago and signed by Hall of Fame Orthodox rabbis from the bridge generation between Europe and America. This proclamation declared that it was prohibited by the Law of the Torah to be a member of an organization of Orthodox and non-Orthodox rabbis. In turn, this edict has been interpreted and expanded by the Orthodox Jewish establishment to include any joint learning or activity that may seem to give tacit approval to non-Orthodox movements.</p>
<p>As only he can, Rabbi Adlerstein softly and respectfully suggests that perhaps it is time to revisit this assumption. He makes two arguments. First, the reason for the proclamation in 5716 was to address Jews on the fence between Orthodox and non-Orthoodox Judaism. In his opinion, this is no longer a valid concern.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/17/we-are-going-in-the-wrong-direction/" target="_blank">I agree</a>. In fact, there is no more fence. Now we have a Grand Canyons between us. The soft center is nearly gone. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/07/09/my-appearance-with-rabbi-shafran-on-talkline-with-zev-brenner/" target="_blank">Rabbi Sacks lamented this in his controversial farewell address</a>. It&#8217;s true. So there is hardly a concern that we are going to lose the soft middle to non-Orthodox movements if we acknowledge they exist.</p>
<p>Second, Rabbi Adlerstein seems to be saying that working together need not imply approval, tacit or otherwise. We are absolutely capable of engaging in a discussion while acknowledging our irreconcilable differences. We do it all the time in real life. We don&#8217;t only talk to people with whom we agree on everything. Somehow it works.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/17/we-are-going-in-the-wrong-direction/" target="_blank">I agree with this as well</a>. Rabbi Shubert Spero made this argument in the 1960&#8242;s. He was correct back then and Rabbi Adlerstein is correct today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that we can be a little more forceful that Rabbi Adlerstein. We actually have a responsibility to our shrinking non-Orthodox brethren to shine bright the light of passionate, compassionate, enlightening and enlightened Judaism. Non-Orthodox Judaism has kept many of our brothers and sisters in the fold. They are Jewish and religious in their own way thanks to Reform, Conservative, and the rest of them. For that we sincerely thank them. But many yearn for more. Not everyone that yearns for more will become Orthodox. Many of them would never attend a lecture that has Kiruv written all over it. But they will attend Limmud. They will attend other pluralistic events. That is our opportunity to inspire them.</p>
<p>There is no cost anymore. There is nothing to fear from showcasing our version of Judaism to more people, even if there is a drum circle 25 yards away. Nothing bad is going to happen. They are not the enemy. Our mutual enemy is leaving Judaism, God, and religion entirely. We are actually partners in that war. Let&#8217;s fight together.</p>
<p>The only reason we think something bad might happen is because we have a rabbinic edict telling us so.</p>
<p>But the truth is that the edict itself never prohibited a rabbi from speaking at Limmud or at a similar event. It merely prohibited membership to pluralistic organizations. We don&#8217;t need to violate the edict in order to participate! Why make the letter more broad than its words? It is shooting ourselves in the foot for no good reason. One can stay loyal to the Gedolim who signed the proclamation and speak at Limmud. They are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>We can debate the value of the rabbinic edict with regard to membership another time. Limmud is not membership. It is a speaking engagement. An amazing opportunity that I can only hope will inspire more rabbis to participate in a similar way in the future. We can pave the way for a time where all Jewish people can learn from one another. Yes, there are even some things that Orthodox Jews can learn from non-Orthodox Jews, despite Jonathan Rosenblum&#8217;s insistence to the contrary.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of unity. We can do great things together if we take a break from chasing demons from the last century.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The ongoing conversation about the agunah problem in the wake of the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/05/the-ny-post-agunah-story-is-about-much-more-than-jewish-divorce/" target="_blank">Gital Dodelson article in the NY Post</a> consistently raises one impossibly difficult question. I’ve been asked this question many times and in many different ways. In my opinion, it’s the fundamental issue of the agunah crisis.</p>
<p>The public is justifiably angry with a husband who does not give a get. But the recalcitrant husband has a pretty compelling argument in his favor.<span id="more-7805"></span></p>
<p>The Torah itself gives the husband absolute authority in the matter of the divorce. If this is Torah law then we are forced to say that this is God’s will. If God gave the power of divorce to the man alone, how can it be considered wrong or evil if he does not give his wife a get? And how can we call it an injustice when he does not give a get? Don’t blame the husband, blame the Torah. The Torah is at fault. God is at fault. Change the laws of divorce and the problem will be solved!</p>
<p>Some variant of this question is the crux of the agunah problem. In simple terms, why is the husband a bad guy when he doesn’t give a get if God gave him the power to decide if he wants to give the get? It is a very difficult question for an Orthodox Jew. And now it is being asked over and over again.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/large-9564591.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7807" alt="large-9564591" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/large-9564591.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think I have an answer to this question.</p>
<p>It’s true that in terms of divorce law, the power to divorce vests in the husband and he is the only one who can dissolve a marriage. The husband must willingly give the get. We are stuck with that law. Pure legalistic Torah matters are almost always unassailable. There is almost no way for contemporary rabbinic authorities to change a law derived from the Torah or even established by Chazal. There’s just no acceptable mechanism within Orthodox Judaism to make changes to Torah law.</p>
<p><em>(Rabbinic laws often have loopholes baked into the law, e.g. eruvei chatzeros, eruv tavshilin. Pruzbul and hefker beis din hefker are examples of the rabbis creating a legal fiction that circumvents Torah laws with regard to money, they do not change the actual Torah laws.)</em></p>
<p>The thing is, divorce law is not the only part of the Torah that informs us how to behave in case of divorce. That part of the Torah is will never change. There are other parts of the Torah that do fluctuate and are subject to societal norms and niceties. Ethical and moral laws in the Torah depend on the context. Kindness and virtue largely depend on the subjective expectations of one’s friends and community. Perhaps at one time a certain act or behavior was considered normal and fair. But at a different time it could be considered evil or wrong. Things in this arena are more subjective and they do change. These <em>bein adam l’chaveiro</em> elements of the Torah always apply and I think they are especially important during a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> One is obligated to love his fellow as himself. “That which is hated to you, do not do to others.” Would a husband want his wife to hold him hostage? No. Thus it is prohibited to hold the wife hostage.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> It is prohibited to cause an animal pain. All the more so it is prohibited to cause pain to a fellow human being. Withholding a get causes extreme pain to the estranged wife.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> One who causes emotional damage to another person is obligated to compensate the victim. One cannot act in a way that causes other emotional harm. R’ Elyashiv <em>paskened</em> that sexual abusers were <em>rodfim</em> (pursuers) because of the emotional harm caused by their violence toward their victims. Causing another person emotional harm is a very serious issue and is absolutely against the Torah.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The Torah requires that we help unload the animal of our enemy. Many authorities learn from this that we are required to lend a helping hand to anyone who requires help. Does a wife waiting for her get not require assistance?<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> We are obligated to follow in the merciful ways of God. Is it merciful to withhold a get? Clearly not. A recalcitrant husband violates this mitzvah as well.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Read the prophets. Their words often constitute rabbinic obligations. They admonish us for mistreating the underprivileged. A wife at the mercy of her husband is underprivileged.</p>
<p>The list goes on. There are many interpersonal obligations and prohibitions that are blatantly trampled upon when one withholds a get. I don’t think there is an doubt about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the objective laws of divorce won’t ever change. But the subjective laws of how to treat one’s wife during a divorce are subject to change. Maybe at one time it was not evil to withhold a get. I don&#8217;t understand it, but I accept that it may have been normative behavior at one time in history. But our common sense tells us that today it is amoral to cause this kind of pain to anyone, let alone one’s wife.</p>
<p>Turns out that while the Jewish laws of divorce don’t obligate the husband to give a get and a wife really cannot divorce her husband, by refusing to give a get the husband is violating several other mitzvahs. In other words, if one isolates the get issue as a pure question of Jewish divorce law it’s true that the wife is powerless and seemingly unprotected. But the Torah is not so simple. We don’t isolate civil law from religious law and we don’t sequester civil and religious law from the Torah’s moral and ethical laws. It’s all part of one Torah given by one God. Exploiting a legal loophole does not justify violating ethical laws in the Torah. It’s forbidden to be a jerk. It’s an <em>issur d’orysa</em> in many instances. It does not matter that the Torah gives him the right to be a jerk. It’s still assur.</p>
<p>I think that the original question obfuscates just how terrible it is to withhold a get. It is so obviously a horrible way to act towards a fellow human being. Regardless of whether it is within the husband’s legal right to withhold the get, it is patently clear that by refusing to give a get a husband is in violation of the ethical and moral laws as well as the spirit of the Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>One of our Jewish sisters, Gital Dodelson (Weiss) published a heartrending account of her marriage to a now-recalcitrant husband Avrohom Weiss. Reading her story brought tears to my eyes. It’s so painful to hear of her struggle and there were a few lines in there that resonate with all of us who may have some issues with parts of the Orthodox Jewish establishment.</p>
<p>There are two sides to every story and her husband’s family and supporters have supported Mr. Weiss’s right to withhold the get.<span id="more-7783"></span></p>
<p>I’ll be quick on the get issue. I don’t care what the supposed justification might be, I don’t care how terrible of a person a wife might be, I don’t care if she broke Jewish tradition, broke Jewish law, is an adulterer, is a bad mother, I don’t care about any of it. There is no justification for withholding a get. Wielding a legal document as a weapon to a person whom one willingly entered into a marriage and supposedly loved and shared a life with, is abuse. I cannot condone any forms of abuse. Emotional, financial, sexual, verbal, or any other form of abuse is against Torah principles.</p>
<p><em>(For more on this topic see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/07/answering-the-most-difficult-question-about-the-agunah-crisis/">Answering the Most Difficult Question About the Agunah Crisis</a>)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/divorce.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7784" alt="divorce" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/divorce-600x400.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Further, the statement from the Weiss camp does not justify not giving a get. Not even in their own words.</p>
<p>In fact, in this case there is apparently a letter (I say apparently, because one never knows if a letter is real these days) from leading Charedi rabbis who support Gital. This is an important fact as the Weiss family carries heavy rabbinic credentials and mockingly claimed that Gital was only being supported by YU and ORA. This is obviously untrue. More importantly, it doesn’t matter. There is no justification for withholding a get.</p>
<p>As an aside, this saga demonstrates how little social sanctions matter in contemporary Orthodox Judaism. No one cares. This guy is not suffering any serious social consequences for his recalcitrance.</p>
<p><strong>But I think this story is more about Orthodox Jewish marriage than it is about Orthodox Jewish divorce.</strong></p>
<p>Gital claims she did not want to continue dating Avrohom after the first or second date. Her parents and support group pushed her into it. And from there, her troubles began.</p>
<p>We’ve discussed the infantilization of young adults within Orthodox Judaism. Parents love their children very much and want what is best for their children. But parents are often wrong and often have different interests than their children. Yet, in the Shidduch System parents vet potential suitors, parents push children to continue dating, parents pay for the wedding and make it a party for their friends that the children are invited to, parents support their children and we all know that money comes with strings attached, the married couple eventually is thrust into difficult life situations with no real life experience, a minivan full of their own children, and no idea how they got there.</p>
<p>Young couples are hardly even given the opportunity to work things out. Dating is short. The focus is on external things and simple things like getting along nicely. But there is rarely enough time to even work out a problem together. Engagements are too quick and hectic to encounter and tackle real challenges. Obviously couples do not live together before marriage so there is no way of really knowing what that is going to be like. They get married and it’s traumatic for most couples. Which would be okay if they had the tools and skills to figure it out. But they don’t. Almost always, pregnancy begins almost immediately and now the focus is on a young woman surviving the difficulties of pregnancy. Eventually that becomes navigating parenthood. But again, there is little time to work on the marriage and the relationship. Let alone time to figure out one’s religious feelings.</p>
<p>Indeed, the system as it is today makes it increasingly difficult to be prepared for life’s challenges. According to Gital, Avrohom says he can’t handle it when things don’t go his way. He’s not the only one.</p>
<p>This dovetails into a bit of anecdotal disillusionment with Orthodox Jewish marriage and post-Yeshiva life. Anecdotally, people are finding it harder to make marriages work and finding it harder to make their frum lifestyle work in sync with their spouse. The sometimes spoken, but always unspoken goal of Orthodox Jewish life until 20years old is to get married. Get a good shidduch. Be a desirable match. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about and then everything is supposed to just work out nicely. Fall in line with the communal standards and way of life. People get married young and before they’ve had a chance to find their religious niche. It can change a lot between the age of 20 and 30. But most of us are married closer to 20 and by the time 30 comes along, it feels like it’s too late.</p>
<p>Gital writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“If I move on romantically without a get, I would have to leave this community — my friends and family and entire support system — because it’s committing adultery. My children and I would be ostracized and not welcomed in the community.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Some people might argue that I should ignore the traditions of the Torah. But I’m deeply religious and won’t go against the God I believe in.”</em></p>
<p>This is one part that made me cry. The feeling of being stuck is more and more common. These people want to be frum. They believe in God. They believe in the Torah. But they don’t believe in many aspects of the Orthodox Jewish lifestyle. But our communities are so monolithic that it makes being a non-conformist very challenging. Sometimes it&#8217;s even social suicide.</p>
<p>It’s easier in Modern Orthodox Judaism, but even there we see an expected conformity that can be uncomfortable for some. Today’s Orthodox Judaism is very rigid in its organization of people and groups. That kind of inflexibility is having an adverse affect on many people.</p>
<p>I am sure there is some Yeshiva guy out there who, after reading this article, says he wants to date for longer or spend more time getting to know a potential shidduch. But will the community and his parents allow it? Unlikely.</p>
<p>Others will read this and wonder why it’s okay for Weiss to terrorize his ex-wife but a woman who wears the wrong clothing is ostracized.</p>
<p>These are legitimate issues that are all raised by the saga between Gital, Avraham, and their supporters. I hope their situation is resolved soon. I really do. But I think the story illustrates some of our more systemic problems that are affecting many more people than just the few Agunos out there.</p>
<p>I thank Gital for writing her story. It gives us an opportunity to reflect on the state of normative Orthodox Judaism today and perhaps a chance to right the ship. It’s a big ship and it doesn’t handle very well. But the next generation of Orthodox Judaism will have a say in how it is steered.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The following exchange appears in this week’s edition of HaModia newspaper.</p>
<p><em>“I am occasionally invited to my uncle’s house for Shabbos. Sometimes he has as his guest a friend who was a yeshiva student in his youth, but unfortunately says he does not believe the Torah comes from Hashem. He gets into discussions with me to challenge my emunah with all kinds of philosophical arguments.</em></p>
<p><em>Should I just ignore him, which may make him think that I accept his arguments, or should I read up on how to respond to these challenges?”<span id="more-7742"></span></em></p>
<p>In his answer R’ Abraham J. Twersky advised the reader to inform the guest that he is not interested in these discussions. He then goes on to explain the pathology of the formerly orthodox Jew. <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7744" alt="presidential-debate" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/presidential-debate-600x400.jpeg" /></p>
<p>In his opinion, the real reason anyone leaves orthodox Judaism is because they want to be able to do anything and everything without restrictions. It’s a matter of self-control, not theology. He is blinded by his desires and thus cannot engage in critical thinking.</p>
<p>This answer betrays a deep misunderstanding of the ex-frum community. It’s simply not true that everyone who leaves orthodox Judaism does so because they have no self-control and are incapable of intelligent conversation. It’s an old trope that if one leaves the strictures of orthodox Judaism they are hedonists. In fact, many of them add new restrictions to their lives and go vegetarian, or exercise regularly to the point that it’s a burden, and of course most of them live very humanist lives. Not too many become gangsters or serial philanderers.</p>
<p>What might be a better answer to the question posed by the reader in this column?</p>
<p>I would say that these discussions should be avoided too. But for a completely different reason.</p>
<p>If this formerly orthodox Jew is coming to a Shabbos table, that’s great. We should make it as comfortable and pleasant as possible. We want him to continue coming to Shabbos meals. If we believe that a Shabbos meal is a positive Jewish experience, and we do, we should want this fellow to attend as many Shabbos meals as possible. We don&#8217;t want him to feel threatened, or judged, or uncomfortable. Your job at the meal is to keep him coming. Stay away from divisive issues of religion. Talk about sports, politics, neighborhood hock, the cholent, anything but the things that divide you. Don&#8217;t be divisive.</p>
<p>Be a friend. Be kind. Be a kiddush Hashem. Don’t be the self assured argumentative intellectual advocate for God that you fancy yourself. The chance of changing his mind is close to nil. Put your energies into being a good person, not being a good debater. You will give him the opportunity to engage in more positive Jewish experiences if you behave like a <em>mentch.</em> So be a <em>mentch!</em></p>
<p>If the questions he poses bother you, there are some excellent books that might quench your thirst for answers. If you don’t need answers and you were only going to research the questions to answer the guest, study something you are interesting in learning.</p>
<p>However, if you are not bothered by the questions, ask yourself why that is so, and think about how deep your faith runs. We all should contemplate how we can answer these questions for ourselves, not simply to win over new recruits to our cause. If we can provide positive Jewish experiences for those who have left orthodox Judaism, we are doing a great service to them and we are making a true kiddush Hashem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>In Israel, a haredi woman named Ruth Colian is asking that the Israeli government stop funding haredi political parties because they discriminate against women. The haredi parties will not place a woman on their ballots, yet they are receiving money from the government. Colian argues that the government is sponsoring gender discrimination by supporting the patriarchal system of haredi Judaism in politics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good argument and I hope she wins. But that&#8217;s not the issue here.<span id="more-7733"></span></p>
<p>The real issue is that Colian is running as a haredi woman for political office. She won&#8217;t run on a secular list because she says she is haredi. She wants to break the glass ceiling in the haredi community. I wish her luck because it won&#8217;t be easy. In the past, people who tried to change haredi norms were either pushed out or left on their own accord. It&#8217;s an uncomfortable place to be a revolutionary but maybe Colian will be the one.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7735" alt="feminism2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/feminism2-510x600.jpg" /></p>
<p>If she is successful, it will mean yet another avenue that haredi women can achieve the same level of acclaim and success as men. Leaving the rabbinate as one of the few places haredi women cannot. That might prove to be a difficult position to maintain.</p>
<p>Corian is a true haredi feminist. She is haredi and she is vying for equal opportunities for women. This is the basic premise of feminism. It comes in many flavors and textures, but at the heart of all of these feminist movements is a sense that men and women should have equal opportunities and that men should not dictate the role that women must play in society. One can see how feminism and haredi life seem incompatible. While it&#8217;s true that many, if not most, haredi women choose to play the dignified and refined role of mother, wife, and homemaker on the sidelines of religious and communal life, there are many women who would prefer to have a choice to play a more public role in religious and communal life. That is what the haredi feminists want.</p>
<p>When juxtaposed with a trailer for an upcoming documentary on the hasidic community of Brooklyn called Uniforms: The Hasidic #Community, Corian&#8217;s struggle seems even more poignant. The documentary was produced by a self proclaimed non-traditional Jewish woman. She offers a peek into the softer, more spiritual side of Hasidic Judaism. It&#8217;s a noble attempt to show good people living good lives. The public has a negative perception of Hasidic Judaism and this documentary could go a long way to bridging that divide.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the extremely problematic conflation of different hasidic groups in the movie, illustrated by the visuals of chasidim in shtreimels and double head coverings for the women, while hip Chabad people talk about their more liberal way of life, there was a line in the trailer that requires attention.</p>
<p>A woman, who almost certainly is Chabad as betrayed by her perfectly unaccented English, proclaims: <em>&#8220;Jewish [sic] women, we&#8217;re kind of the biggest feminist women out there. Judaism creates space for women to tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I think that if a woman wants to &#8220;tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children&#8221; she should have that opportunity. I am all for traditional values for women that want those values in their lives. It&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s one of the secrets to Orthodox Judaism. In fact, I think it&#8217;s a problem that so many husbands and fathers are studying all day while their wives are leaving the home to support their husbands and babies are being dropped off at day care. I believe the traditional home is a great ideal and bearing children is a wonderful and powerful role to play in this world.</p>
<p>However, it is decidedly not feminist. It can be feminist to choose that life. But if everyone is doing it, or is expected to do it, it does not fit any accepted meaning of the word. You can&#8217;t unilaterally change the entire meaning of the word feminist and apply it to haredi Judaism. It doesn&#8217;t pass the laugh test, forget the smell test.</p>
<p>And why is feminism an ideal for this haredi woman? Why is she trying to pretend that a world where women are not given every opportunity that men are given and they are expected to produce large families is feminist. It&#8217;s not feminist at all. Proudly so! Recently, I heard a prominent rabbi say that Jewish feminists were comparable to reform and conservative Judaism! Orthodox Judaism is not feminist. You need to be okay with that to be orthodox.</p>
<p>In Israel, Ruth Corian is dying for the opportunity to lead her community. She is a feminist. In Brooklyn the party line is apparently that being a mom is the most feminist thing one can do.</p>
<p>Again, I am not degrading moms. God forbid! I think it&#8217;s a great choice if one can and one wants to make it. But it&#8217;s not feminist if that is what is expected. But even more perplexing is why are you trying to call it feminist?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is an isolated incident. I&#8217;ve seen this more and more often. People are selling Orthodox Judaism as feminist. I&#8217;m a pretty liberal Orthodox Jew and I don&#8217;t see how anyone could interpret my religion as feminist.</p>
<p>Personally, it bothers me. I grapple with it. I struggle with the current inequality and I empathize with those orthodox Jewish women who want to play a more prominent public role. I wish Orthodox Judaism had more feminist opportunities. I do my best to accommodate feminism within tradition. But I don&#8217;t redefine the term to conform to my orthodox worldview. Words have meaning and that meaning must be respected.</p>
<p>It seems impossible, if not extremely unlikely, that orthodox Judaism will ever have equal opportunities for men and women. Maybe that&#8217;s okay. Not every religion or creed has to conform with every modern sensibility. But let&#8217;s at least be honest about it. And if we can, try to break as many glass ceilings that we can shatter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Pew conducted a study of Jews in America and has released a comprehensive report based on its findings. Nearly 2800 religious Jewish people were interviewed and the results of those interviews make up the model for the results of the study. It&#8217;s difficult conduct a study like this and achieve meaningful results. I am not a statistician nor can I compare the sample sizes used in this study with others. To my untrained eye, it seems small.</p>
<p>There are many very interesting findings to discuss. I have three things I want to say about the study.</p>
<p>First, people will point to the staggering number of orthodox Jews who are no longer orthodox. That number is 52%. It seems impossible to believe. That means that over half of people raised orthodox are no longer orthodox. Think about the orthodox Jewish friends and family you know. Does it make sense to say that over half of them are no longer orthodox? I don&#8217;t think so.<span id="more-7664"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7665" alt="jew-chp3-3" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp3-3.png" />If you drill down a bit you notice a couple of things. For starters, I know many people who say they were raised orthodox because they went to a yeshiva or modern orthodox school even if they weren&#8217;t frum at home. I went to school with several people like that. Those people certainly skew the numbers. After all, the study relied on self identification. There was no process to classify people into categories other than to ask them.</p>
<p>But the real key here what the numbers are for young people being raised in contemporary orthodoxy. Those numbers are impressive. 83% of people raised as orthodox Jews under the age of 30 stay. This is a huge success. It&#8217;s also a number that correlates with anecdotal evidence. So the people who were raised orthodox and no longer are orthodox are mostly older people. What does this mean?</p>
<p>It means one of two things or perhaps a hybrid of two. [It doesn't mean that orthodox Jews leave the fold in their 30's and 40's at alarmingly high rates.] It could either mean that orthodoxy is much stronger today than it was 20 and 30 years ago. People get a better Jewish education, there is more insularity, and the shift to ultra orthodoxy which outnumbers modern orthodoxy by nearly 10:1 in this demographic is working to keep more orthodox Jews orthodox. Alternatively, it signifies a shift in who attends orthodox schools. In other words, 20-30 years ago it was far more likely for a family to send a child to an orthodox school and identify as orthodox even if they were not totally observant of halacha. There was more cross-pollination and there were fewer non-orthodox options. So you wind up with more people from previous generations identifying as being raised orthodox even though they weren&#8217;t truly orthodox through and through. This is rarer today because we are more insular and non-orthodox or unaffiliated Jews feel less comfortable in orthodox institutions. The truth is likely a combination of the two but the latter does concern me.</p>
<p>Also, very few middle aged and older people consider themselves ultra-orthodox. It&#8217;s a youth movement. Sure, some mellow out and switch affiliation. But it&#8217;s also a recent phenomena that is sweeping orthodoxy. It&#8217;s pretty compelling evidence that what is happening now for the under 40 orthodox Jew is different from what their parents and grandparents experienced. It&#8217;s a different kind of Judaism. The numbers bear it out.</p>
<p>Next, the non-orthodox denominations are falling apart. The numbers support the rumblings and rumors regarding the demise of Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism is dwindling as well. Some orthodox Jews like to cheer while these two denominations begin to disappear. Others view it as a sign that those Jews must be saved and brought into orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I think that it is important for Judaism that non-orthodox denominations are strong and vibrant. I think that orthodox Jews should be concerned and make efforts to help revive non-orthodox Judaism. This sounds controversial and heretical but it&#8217;s really not. Orthodox Judaism is not going to magically become the Judaism for the 89% of non-orthodox Jews. We can either wish them well and watch them disappear or we can try to keep them connected to their Jewish heritage. I think the latter choice is preferable. Now we can either keep them connected by &#8220;making them orthodox&#8221; as if that is even possible, or we can rely on strong non-orthodox denominations to keep them in the fold. I think the latter choice is preferable here too. It&#8217;s certainly the more likely option to achieve widespread success. While resources are precious in the orthodox community, I think strengthening the non-orthodox denominations is a worthy endeavor. They are also our brothers and sisters. If we value what we have, we should do whatever we can to help them stay somewhat connected to their Judaism. A little bit of a good thing is a whole lot better than nothing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7666" alt="jew-chp4-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp4-2-306x600.png" /></p>
<p>The last thing for now are the numbers on belief in God. 96% of ultra-orthodox Jews are <em>certain </em>that there is a God. Certain. That&#8217;s a very high number. I also wonder how they can all be so certain. The modern orthodox number is 77%. Also a very high number for certainty. 8% of ultra-orthodox Jews believe but are less certain and 19% of modern orthodox Jews fit that description. I think that both of those numbers are really higher. Most people don&#8217;t think about belief in God. They just do it. But the question wasn&#8217;t simply about belief. The question measured the certainty of the believer. I am skeptical that someone can be certain of something without being able to make a compelling argument in favor of that certainty. How many of us can make that argument? If we can&#8217;t, can we be certain? <em>(Stay tuned for an essay on this issue sometime soon.)</em></p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting numbers in this section are the numbers of people who &#8220;do not believe.&#8221; Here the number for ultra-orthodox is 1% while it is 3% for modern orthodox. Practicing Judaism under a state of disbelief s not an easy proposition. If one doesn&#8217;t think the mitzvos and traditions have Divine meaning then they are bound to become a huge burden. However, orthopraxy &#8211; practicing Judaism despite disbelief is a growing trend. I wonder what these numbers will look like in a few years. It&#8217;s possible that more people who do not believe in God will feel comfortable in orthodox Judaism and they will grow as a public group. But it&#8217;s also possible that a rise in those numbers will inspire a thorough vetting of all orthodox Jews which would force all orthoprax Jews into a closet or out of orthodox Judaism altogether.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other interesting numbers to discuss. (97% of ultra-orthodox Jews have all or mostly Jewish friends. That&#8217;s insularity! How about only 57% of orthodox Jews are Republicans? And the support for Israel numbers need addressing as well.) Perhaps I will revisit the study and more of its social commentary in a future post. For now, these are the three things that jumped out at me.</p>
<p><em>Note: The orthodox people surveyed were all from Brooklyn, Monsey, and Lakewood. I think this might be significant.</em> (EDIT: This is imprecise. Those were the oversampled counties. My apologies.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A couple of weeks ago, The Atlantic ran an article written by the loving wife of a victim of childhood sexual abuse. The article is difficult to read yet doubly rewarding. First, the appreciation for the challenges abuse victims encounter and how they affect those who love them and second, the very sweet end of the article nearly outweighs the darkness of the rest of the article.</p>
<p>I have often (naively) said that if the <em>gedolim </em>would really understand the way abuse affects its victims, it they would really comprehend the trauma and horrors of abuse they would not hesitate to report abuse to the police.<span id="more-7615"></span> I&#8217;ve been told that the <em>gedolim </em>have been made aware of the severity of abuse and to no avail. This article would be part of that presentation that I naively think would change their minds on abuse. In a very direct and practical way, this article demonstrates just how deeply the victim of abuse feels their pain. Further, it illustrates how far reaching the trauma of abuse can be. It affects so many people beyond the initial victim.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7616" alt="discriminacion-mayorias-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/discriminacion-mayorias-2-600x424.jpg" /><br />
For that reason alone I recommend reading the article.</p>
<p>But there is so much more. In a large portion of the orthodox Jewish world, young men and women meet upon the approval of their parents. Mothers and fathers vet possible date prospects for their children. They rarely know these prospective mates personally. Rather, resumes are distributed and phone calls are placed to common friends and beyond. Parents are often overwhelmed with suggestions. It&#8217;s easy enough to eliminate the damaged goods before even embarking on a thorough investigation.But unfortunately there is a negative consequence to this kind of education in the orthodox Jewish community. Because victims of abuse are dealing with so much in their lives, they can be stigmatized and shunned as potential spouses.</p>
<p>Divorced parents? No thanks. Brother is no longer frum? No thanks. Sister didn&#8217;t go to seminary? No thanks. He&#8217;s in college? No way. She&#8217;s in law school? No thanks. Baal Teshuva? No thanks. At risk teen who figured things out at around 20 years old? No thanks.</p>
<p>Superficial details that have almost zero value in determining the true nature of the prospect can eliminate the prospect from contention very early on in the process. This results in a haves and have nots environment.</p>
<p>Organic dating avoids this issue. Boys meets girl, they get on well, they get to know each other, the develop feelings for one another, and then the superficial details emerge. By that time, very few sane people would toss out a relationship because his parents are divorced or she has a brother who is not frum. The relationship is more important than those petty details.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic dating has its own set of problems that the shidduch system can help avoid. I am not arguing in favor or against shidduch dating in this post. It&#8217;s just the reality of the shidduch scene that this is what happens.</p>
<p>According to my anecdotal, non-scientific research and basic reasoning skills, one of the greatest fears that frum abuse victims have is that they will be branded as damaged goods and find themselves at the bottom of the shidduch Totem pole. It is a legitimate fear. It&#8217;s stupid, but it is probably what would to happen. If parents hear a potential shidduch candidate was abused it makes sense within the misplaced priorities and confines of the shidduch system that they would just eliminate that person from consideration immediately.</p>
<p>By contrast, the first thing you learn about someone after meeting them is usually not whether they were abused. Obviously. In a good relationship, eventually it is likely to be disclosed and discovered and most probably dealt with together. So the abuse issue only arises once there is a couple with an existing relationship. If the abuse creates an unhealthy environment for a relationship that might doom the couple. But the information alone does not torpedo the relationship like it can within the shidduch system.</p>
<p>Thus, as much as we need to educate ourselves and our communities about the horrors of abuse, we also need to be careful not to allow ourselves to think that abuse victims are damaged goods who should be placed on the bottom of the deck when it comes to shidduchim. It&#8217;s a very difficult and narrow path to navigate but it is a necessary one. One solution to this problem might be jettisoning the shidduch system. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen. Instead, I think we will need to make a conscious effort to walk this tightrope. Let victims know that we empathize with their pain and their struggles. But we also are careful to make sure that victims know that we believe in them and in their ability to lead proud, confident, and successful lives. We all have challenges in life. Victims of abuse may have struggles that are more public than others, but we all have our struggles and no one group should have their struggles written off as inferior or that their struggles should automatically disqualify them from living orthodox Jewish life at its fullest.</p>
<p>For that matter, none of the superficial shidduch disqualifications make any sense. Let&#8217;s do away with all of them. But I think the abuse issue needs attention first because of how far behind we are in handling abuse and because suffering in silence compounds the trauma of abuse.</p>
<p>Please read the article and let&#8217;s start working together on the healing process, both individual and communal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>An interview with Rabbi Mendel Epstein has gone viral. The protagonist of the article is Rabbi Epstein, a man who has dedicated his life to helping women navigate the rough waters of Jewish divorce. He is a professional to&#8217;ein (Jewish for lawyer) and advocates for women. He has a lot of insight. He also carries a bias. We all do. There&#8217;s no crime in bias. But it&#8217;s important that we know what we are dealing with.<span id="more-7576"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7580" alt="82507772MB023_2008_Republic" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Bill-of-Rights1-600x296.jpg" /></p>
<p>In terms of substance, I agree with a lot of what Rabbi Epstein says. Obviously. Who wouldn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>He comes off a bit paternalistic at times. He&#8217;s also working in a very male dominated social environment so some of what he says sounds uncomfortable to more modern ears. I think it&#8217;s clear that he is talking about a fairly insular charedi community. Most of the modern orthodox or even centrist yeshiva type people I know are fully aware of these things and don&#8217;t need to be informed or even reminded to treat their wives respectfully.</p>
<p>Four items in his &#8220;Bill of Rights&#8221; for Orthodox Jewish wives are:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(1) A wife must be treated with respect and not be abused. A woman in an abusive relationship has a right to seek a get.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(2) She is entitled to be supported by her husband. Read the kesubah.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(3) A husband is obligated to honor and respect his wife’s parents.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(4) She is entitled to a normal conjugal relationship.</p>
<p>He also cites some very specious anecdotal evidence about divorce and infidelity that sound exaggerated. He basically tries to assert the &#8220;it might lead to mixed dancing&#8221; argument as fact.</p>
<p>But here is the real problem. What kind of society needs to be told these things? How is this all not patently obvious? What kind of world needs a rabbi to affirm these basic principles?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not as if Rabbi Epstein is saying that there a few people who need to be reminded or scolded about these things. He seems to be saying that this Bill of Rights is necessary for our entire society. This makes me ill.</p>
<p>We tout our communities as safe havens from the dysfunction on the outside. But is it true? Is there dysfunction on the outside? Are we functioning better? These are very difficult claims to answer. Rabbi Epstein seems to be poking a hole in our armor. It seems that in some ways we need to look to the outside as our guide on how to behave. Ask any middle-class, educated, family orientated person about marriage and there is no doubt that they will echo Rabbi Epstein&#8217;s supposed bombshell.</p>
<p>But how does this happen? How is it that we are falling behind?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that we have demonized the outside so much in our communities and educational systems that we passively reject whatever they espouse. We gloss over חכמה בגויים תאמין. We think that we have the answers and they don&#8217;t. Eventually this leads us to a place where we tune out the good ideas and advice from the outside and bad habits and poor social standards become set in our communities.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that there are many people who need to hear this Bill of Rights. But I also don&#8217;t doubt that anyone normal would agree with them. So why does it need to be said? It has to be that we simply ignore these issues. Why are we ignoring them if the rest of modern society is addressing them? There is no satisfactory answer to this question.</p>
<p>One more thing. Rabbi Epstein places too much faith in the Beis Din system. I have never in my entire life heard of someone who had a positive Beis Din experience. It seems extremely unlikely that a woman&#8217;s best course of action is to go to a Beis Din that requires both parties to agree to a binding arbitration. The problems with our Beis Din system are well known and it&#8217;s a disservice to his audience that Rabbi Esptein recommends entering into this basically corrupt system. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/18/restoring-credibility-to-the-beis-din-system/" target="_blank">Restoring Credibility to the Beis Din System</a>.</p>
<p>The article ends with a call for action and ideas for solutions. I think it&#8217;s pretty simple. Reinstitute חכמה בגויים תאמין. Start learning from the outside. Read secular books of marriage and intimacy. Pay attention to what psychologist, marriage therapists, and secular experts say. Rabbis have to stop dismissing everything that comes from outside the Beis Medrash. We can learn a lot from experts on these matters, especially intimacy. We have to start respecting people outside our community and not believing as a matter of faith that a <em>yarmulka</em> and a <em>sheitel</em> and a <em>vort</em> and a 500 guest wedding and <em>sheva brachos</em> and <em>shana rishona</em> are going to magically make for great marriages and happy couples.</p>
<p>There are many very happy marriages within our community. There are also many happy marriages outside our community. We can learn from them. We should learn from them. Hopefully we can arrive at a place where we can laugh at the absolute silliness of a Bill of Rights that says not to abuse women, to provide for one&#8217;s family, and to be intimate with one&#8217;s wife. I hope we get there soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Another voice has entered the online discussion about Bible Criticism and orthodox Judaism. Professor Jacob L. Wright is an orthodox Jew who has studied, taught, and written extensively on Bible Criticism.</p>
<p>He made waves Pesach time when he published a provocative article on the Huffington Post where he talked about &#8220;The Myth of Moses.&#8221; In his article he explained that his view of the Bible is that it is a composite work with each layer added for a specific reason. In the Moses story, there was a need to justify the existence of an Egyptian prince named Moses who saved the Israelites and establish him as a bona fide Israelite. So the Bible tells the story of a boy who was cast off by his mother into the Nile. This story has very obscure references as the names of the major players in the story are not mentioned. Later, the story was viewed as salacious so new details were added as a prologue to the story.<span id="more-7473"></span></p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t the Bible and I weren&#8217;t orthodox, this would be a great theory to explain anomalies in the text. But it is the Bible and I am orthodox so it hardly sits well with me when the Bible is explained away as myth.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7475" alt="157328845" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/157328845-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p>Professor Wright was interviewed by Professor Alan Brill on his <a href="http://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/08/19/interview-with-prof-jacob-wright-of-emory-university/" target="_blank">Kavvanah</a> website. The interview is worth your time and consideration if you don&#8217;t mind reading what is widely considered to be absolute kefira.</p>
<p>The first important thing in the interview is the introduction where Brill outlines the current status of Biblical Criticism. It&#8217;s required reading so I copy it in full here:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As background, the problems of the Bible go back to the tenth and eleventh century Islamic critiques of the Bible by Ibn Hazm and others. Second, modern figures such as Spinoza and Jean Astruc sought to understand the Bible as a human book using the same tools that we use to understand Greek and Roman books. And in the 19th century, Wellhausen popularized a theory that the Pentateuch had four authors. But the important part of his theory was that the ritual and priestly material was a priestly Pharisaic digression from the original pure faith of the prophets necessitating Christianity for a restoration. Hence, Solomon Schechter called it higher anti-Semitism, David Zvi Hoffman showed that Leviticus is not in contradiction to the rest of the story, Kaufman showed that the prophets assumed the priestly material, and Cassuto showed based on Sumerian and Akkadian sources that the divisions fail.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Well, Wellhausen was writing a century ago, with the aforementioned defenses all formulated in a post WWI climate. For at least forty years the field was already given to authors such as Gunkel who assumes the Bible is legend, the way Gilgamesh is legend. And Martin Noth who assumed most of the narrative was formulated originally as oral traditions- read here. Questions of redaction were not tied to Wellhausen, or even literary documents, but to oral traditions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">What do historians currently think about the context of the Bible? They assume that it was written between 720 BCE and 587 BCE, between the destruction of the Northern Kingdom destruction of Jerusalem, with some editing until the end of Ezra’s life circa 440 BCE. (Minimalists make it more recent and Evangelicals defend the chronological dates.) They work from parallels to Assyrian texts, the nature of script, linguistics, and reconstructed context of author. Little of this has anything to do with literary doublets. If you want to reject historical criticism, then start learning ancient linguistics and texts contemporary to the Bible. No harmonization of passages changes this dating nor does anything from Cassutto or Hoffman affect it. (However, Prof. Josh Berman is seeking to shift the discussion from Assyrians to the Hittites in 1300 BCE, an effort that may be accepted by the Orthodox but does not promise to have much of an impact on the experts. But it is better than refuting Kugel, who is not a historian of ancient Israel or source critic so the critique does not help.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This past May there was a major conference at Hebrew University on“Convergence and Divergence in Pentateuchal Theory;” if you are interested in these topics, then that was the place to be. The conference opened up with a clear statement that there are three approaches: a Documentary approach (not based on Wellhausen but on Noth and others) where there are separate documents; a Supplementary approach,where a single document get more and more complex; and a Fragmentary approach, where we cannot separate out authors or layers anymore.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Finally returning to Cassuto, he may have rejected Wellhausen but he accepted historical context, showing that all the numbers and genealogies in Genesis do not correspond to ages and events, rather are stylized number, ten generations, twelve children. He does this by reading the ancient parallels to the Biblical story.<br />
Wright answers Brill&#8217;s various questions and hte discussion is fascinating and worth your time.</p>
<p>However I would like to focus on the end of the interview. Here, Brill asks the million dollar question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>How can one be a shomer Torah uMizvot and accept historical criticism?</em></p>
<p>Wright basically dodges the question by attacking those who attack Biblical Criticism without a background in the field. He also reassures the reader that there are plenty of scholars who are shomer Torah u&#8217;Mitzvos. Wright reiterates the question and fails to provide a sufficient answer. If anything, his answer strengthens the question. He answers that he is in awe of the authors of the Bible. Their genius makes it a compelling work. In conclusion, the Torah is authoritative but not divine.</p>
<p>I tried to follow up in the comments and ask why anyone would feel compelled to adhere to an ancient man made book of rules. Wright replied that the Torah has divine origins but is not divine. I was eventually directed to Gideon Slifkin&#8217;s Facebook page where Wright says he went into more detail. I followed instructions but the discussion there did not deliver.</p>
<p>This is the crux of the issue. In mainstream frum circles today, from Satmar and Lakewood to YU and Merkaz HaRav, the assumption is that if the Torah is not approximately 99.99% of what God gave Moses at Sinai then people would not keep the Torah. That is the basic assumption. The fear of Bible Criticism is that it assumes (or even purports to prove) that the Torah is not 100% divine. Some scholars say it&#8217;s 0% divine, but that is not a necessary assumption to Bible Criticism. The only way Bible Criticism will ever be accepted in mainstream frum circles is if this assumption about keeping the Torah changes. If this assumption is replaced with the assumption that people will keep the Torah even if the Torah we have today is a composite work based on an original divine revelation at Sinai then the fear of Bible Criticism disappears.</p>
<p>As an aside, I see no reason to think that this assumption (i.e. that even if God is not responsible for 100% of the Torah we would keep the Torah) could not work. We keep plenty of things that are not from God. We keep all the Rabbinic Mitzvos and many customs on top of those as well. So I think there is no reason that the current assumption is unimpeachable and unchangeable.</p>
<p>The challenge will be carving out a version of Biblical Criticism that doesn&#8217;t undermine our mandate that we keep the Torah but allows for subsequent emendations and additions. Is it possible? Not yet. It will only become a possibility once we as a collective group realize that the Torah need not be 100% from God in order for us to keep it. But once the current assumption is replaced with the new assumption I think we will see Bible Criticism seep into the frum community as an acceptable form of study. As a matter of comparison, Talmudic criticism was once considered taboo and is gaining slow acceptance in some frum circles.</p>
<p>For all the uproar over R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s position, I feel that his is far more tenable than Wright&#8217;s position on this issue. R&#8217; Farber holds that prophets made additions to the original text of the Torah. This is extremely controversial, but at least God is the one doing the writing, albeit through God&#8217;s prophets. Wright&#8217;s version has too much human interference to be taken seriously as a document that requires our attention. His basic approach is that if it&#8217;s meaningful we will do it no matter where it comes from. This is weak and I doubt it would survive more than a couple generations at most.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the assumption about what it takes for people to keep the Torah is far too limiting. Once it expands I think we will see an increase in Bible Criticism that is acceptable in frum circles. I hope we can get there before we lose too many people based on the wrong assumptions.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not troubling to me that people would want a phone that is insulated from certain tasks. Although I think it is an unnecessary measure and perhaps counter productive, I don&#8217;t begrudge people their personal self control restraints.<span id="more-7468"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7469" alt="cert1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/cert1.jpg" /></p>
<p>What is troubling is that a kashrus agency is part of this initiative. A kashrus agency should be concerned with one thing and one thing only. Their singular concern should be the kosher status of the food. I don&#8217;t even think that a kashrus agency must concern itself with humanitarian or other ethical issues that may arise. I have no problem with a secondary agency coming in and providing a secondary level of supervision. But the kosher status of the food cannot be affected by anything other its status as kosher food.</p>
<p>So when I see a kashrus agency entering into the phone market, I see an agency that should be worried about kosher status of food but is now legislating morality. It&#8217;s not even as if the technical skills involved in kosher supervision overlap the neutering of cell phones. They have nothing to do with each other. I don&#8217;t think it is smart for kosher supervision to be intertwined or even related to morality supervision.</p>
<p>Similarly, when kosher supervision agencies make demands on the clientele or ambience of an eating establishment I believe they are overstepping their bounds. There are restaurants that are not allowed to be open at certain hours because they will lose their hechsher if they are open. This is far beyond the scope of kosher supervision. Tell me if the food is kosher and I will decide if I want to patronize the restaurant. That is all we need from a kashrus agency. The stretching of their authority serves no important purpose for the public. It seems to me that it is merely a self-serving, self-righteous way to legislate their morality. If they can legislate phones and who can eat where, what&#8217;s next?</p>
<p>I am not making a slippery slope argument. I am pointing out that there is no logical connection between the kosher status of food and the kosher status of a phone. There is also no relationship between the kosher status of a restaurant and whether teenagers are hanging out. In other words, the kashrus agencies are already legislating their morality. There is no reason to think it only will apply in these two instances because there is no connection between these two things and the kosher status of food.</p>
<p>We need to stop using the word kosher for things other than food. Yes, the word is a general term but it has evolved into a word that describes whether food can be eaten by orthodox Jews who keep kosher. We don&#8217;t eat anything that is not kosher. Using the word kosher for phones and Internet implies that the non-kosher versions are not allowed to be used. This is sophomoric and divisive.</p>
<p>If anything, the kashrus agencies should be concerned with the ethics and morality of the actual food. This is something they have resisted time and time again. I am not recommending they get into the ethics of food business, but if they must expand their business and purview of supervision I think that is the first place they should be looking to legislate seeing as they have the knowledge and expertise to monitor and report on that aspect of food production. But teens mingling and phones? They don&#8217;t belong there at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The new issue of The New Republic cover story is about us. It is about Haredim, modern Orthodox, and women. These are things we discuss regularly online and at our Shabbos tables, and in our coffee rooms. The story is remarkably accurate and balanced, displaying a very deep understanding of the issues in Israel today. I recommend reading the article immediately.</p>
<p>Imagine a spectrum of religious fundamentalism in the orthodox Jewish community. On one end you have extreme Haredi sects and on the other end you have completely secular Israelis. On most things and for most of time the people in the middle, let&#8217;s call them modern orthodox, skewed their allegiences toward the Haredi side. Orthodoxy is the great uniter. The assumption is that any two orthodox people will have more common interests than an orthodox and a secular Jew. This is how things were.<span id="more-7442"></span></p>
<p>In essence, the article argues that while naturally aligned with their fellow orthodox Jews, women from the modern orthodox community in Israel are finding themselves aligned with secular feminist Jews in Israel. The collective pain that is felt due to the oppressiveness toward women in the extreme and not so extreme Haredi world is taking a toll. Women have been attacked physically, verbally, and psychologically for a long time and it is starting to create a negative reaction.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7443" alt="article_inset_lithwick_2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/article_inset_lithwick_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Several times the article mentions signs that tell women how to dress. We have become accustomed to these signs. But the women in the article argue that the signs give license to thugs who want to make a statement to women. To them, the signs mean much more than &#8220;Please be sensitive to our religious beliefs.&#8221; Part of that is because these standards are entering the public sphere and are no longer just limited to the private insular neighborhoods. But the other part of it is that the signs are somehow justifying the negativity and violence toward women.</p>
<p>What has happened is that women who feel hurt and abused are turning to secular and Reform Jews for salvation. Feminism is a dirty word in many orthodox communities, even in some places within the modern orthodox community. But it&#8217;s becoming a necessary evil for modern orthodox women who are not feminists at all to ask for help from feminists. It&#8217;s odd when orthodox people are funding they have more in common with secular and very liberal Jews than fellow orthodox Jews. But that is what is happening.</p>
<p>The article also talks about modern orthodox women who sympathize with the Women of the Wall. I wish they would be more vocal but i was heartened to hear it.</p>
<p>Last week I wrote about finding common ground and room for dialogue between modern orthodox and yeshivish Jews in America. (See:<br />
<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/08/02/maybe-rabbi-birnbaum-has-a-point-a-solution/">Maybe Rabbi Birnbaum Has a Point: A Solution</a>) I think what we are seeing in the article in TNR is what will happen if we can&#8217;t work together. If the people in the middle start to feel like the liberal and secular Jews are more sympathetic to their way of life, the great split that has been predicted for years, will finally happen. Modern orthodox Judaism will become an independent group.</p>
<p>Some might say, what&#8217;s so bad about that? Well there are plenty negative consequences to mention. But I will mention the two biggest issues. First, the Haredi institutions will fall without modern orthodox support. Some might say that&#8217;s not so bad either. I disagree. Their services are necessary, as is their trap door into engagement with society. On the other side, without a connection the Haredi community, the modern orthodox community will be hard pressed to support its own institutions for lack of qualified teachers and rabbis.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not in our best interests to see a formal split. It might happen in Israel and it might happen in America. I think we should do everything we can to prevent it. The first thing we need to do, is get together and talk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The most important discussion in orthodox Judaism right now is the pair of articles written by R&#8217; Zev Farber. The articles have been deemed heresy by R&#8217; Gordimer on Cross-Currents. If you are averse to reading anything that might touch on issues and ideas that are possibly heretical please stop reading and pick up a Nesivos Shalom or something.</p>
<p>Still here? Okay. The two articles say different things so I&#8217;d like to briefly address the <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2013/07/18/from-openness-to-heresy/" target="_blank">Cross-Currents post</a> as it relates to the &#8220;<a href="http://thetorah.com/devarim-recounting-different/" target="_blank">short article.</a>&#8221; This article went through two versions. R&#8217; Gordimer&#8217;s article used the first version which was more objectionable. R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s article was edited a full week before the article on Cross-Currents was published. I find this to be egregious. If you are going to call someone a heretic, possibly the worst thing to call an orthodox Jew, you best be sure that every detail of your case is accurate.<span id="more-7405"></span></p>
<p>The original version said this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The simplest explanation for these differences between the accounts in Exodus-Numbers and Deuteronomy is that they were penned by (at least) two different authors with different conceptions of the desert experience.</em></p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Despite sharing many details with the desert story as told in Exodus and Numbers, there is no way to make the two versions work with each other without unreasonably stretching the meaning of the texts. Whether it be the description of the scout story, the reaction of the Edomites and Moabites to Israel’s request, or the legitimacy of dwelling in the Transjordan, the two versions work with contradictory assumptions.</em></p>
<p>I can see why R&#8217; Gordimer thinks this is heresy. I don&#8217;t think it has to be as will be discussed later. But the second version is almost certainly not heresy. This is the revised version:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Despite sharing many details with the desert story as told in Exodus and Numbers, there appears to be no way to make the two versions work with each other without unreasonably stretching the meaning of the texts. The simplest literary approach is the academic one which posits multiple authors with multiple traditions. How such an approach meshes with traditionalist belief requires serious thought but it is necessary to start by recognizing the simplicity and straightforwardness of the academic approach.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7406" alt="Bible1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bible1.jpg" /></p>
<p>There is nothing remarkable about this statement. It simply states that the academic approach is simpler. Simpler is not necessarily more truthful. Thus, there is no value judgment on whether the academic approach is preferable. I hope that if this was the only thing R&#8217; Farber said, it would not have created a controversy. I hope. For this reason, I am disappointed in the Cross-Currents article.</p>
<p>However, whenever I raise this point I am reminded of the other &#8220;<a href="http://thetorah.com/torah-history-judaism-introduction/" target="_blank">long article</a>&#8221; where the heresy is stronger and harder to wiggle out of.</p>
<p>On to the second article.</p>
<p>This is R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s worldview. It is his Grand Theory of Everything. His goal is clear. R&#8217; Farber wants very badly to harmonize all the things he has taken for granted as an orthodox Jew, his adherence to halacha and social orthodoxy, with modern Biblical Criticism. This is his goal and it is important to begin with an appreciation of his assumptions.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Farber takes the challenges presented by Bible critics very seriously. It&#8217;s hard not to take them seriously. They are asking good questions. It&#8217;s true that we have &#8220;frum&#8221; answers for most of these questions and some of the questions are not so bothersome. Yet, the challenges exist.</p>
<p>The maximalist Bible critic answer is the text is not Divine. It is a text that comes from people and therefore any anomaly is understood as poor editing by a later redactor. The various writers have different agendas and their works reflect their personal biases.</p>
<p>The maximalist orthodox Jewish answer is that the text is Divine. It is a text that comes from God and therefore any anomaly is understood as part of the infinite wisdom of the Author of the Torah. The different versions of stories and laws reflect Divine intent to teach us everything we need to know.</p>
<p>There is a huge chasm between these two approaches. They share nothing other than the questions that they ask.</p>
<p>But most thinking people know that the maximalist orthodox Jewish position is untenable. No one really thinks that. The people who do are &#8220;mesorah maximalists&#8221; who will hide from the truth to support their position. The Talmud discusses the last few verses of Devarim. Chazal had a different midpoint to their Torah scrolls. Ezra reconciled the texts of several versions of Torah scrolls. Maimonides reconciled errors he found in Torah scrolls using the Aleppo Codex. Rashi had at least one discrepancy in his Torah scroll. Ibn Ezra famously said that there are twelve places in the Chumash that speak in present tense and those were not written by Moses.</p>
<p>In other words, we know that some parts of the Chumash were not spoken by God to Moses. That&#8217;s certainly acceptable in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>We also know that there is a dispute about the very nature of the book of Devarim. The Ramban says it was given word for word from God to Moses at Sinai. Others say Moses spoke these words as prophecy. Contrasted with the rest of the Chumash, it is more similar to the books of the prophets than Sefer Vayikra in this respect. The Avnei Nezer says that Devarim is a bridge between the Written Law and the Oral Law as it is Moshe&#8217;s discourse where he darshens the first four books of the Chumash.</p>
<p>The point is obvious. Devarim is treated differently by the Medieval commentators. The maximalist orthodox Jewish answer is not a reasonable position. Legitimate sources recognize this and we must recognize this as well. The question I wish to address is why. Why do we find these sort of opinions about Devarim and other scattered examples throughout the Chumash?</p>
<p>There are two possible answers. I think here we find a difference of opinion loosely based on affiliation. Charedim subscribe to one view and non-charedim subscribe to another.</p>
<p>Charedim are more apt to say that God included all aforementioned items when God gave the Torah to Moses. God told Moses to make the book of Devarim sound different. It was part of God&#8217;s plan that errors rf anachronisms creep into the text for the sake of the answers that would be given later. They were latent in the text the entire time but were waiting for the right people to reveal them.</p>
<p>Non-Charedim are more likely to take a different approach. This alternative approach holds that things may have happened after revelation and great Torah authorities used their wisdom and Torah knowledge to answer the questions in the best way they know how. This means that the issues that forced the hand of the great sages were the result of history, scribal errors, or any other circumstance that could have caused the problems. The answers are true to Torah because of the people who said them and their universal acceptance by the greater Jewish people.</p>
<p>We could say the same thing about the drashos we find in Chazal whether they be Halachic or Aggadic. One way of looking at it is that these drashos were latent in the text, they were always there, they were always kept, they were just &#8220;revealed&#8221; by the various tanaim and amoraim. The other view is that these drashos were Chazal&#8217;s way of dealing with textual and perhaps social or religious issues. They could have learned differently, but they chose to learn this way. The drashos that gained consensus became Torah. This approach certainly rings true when studying the Talmud.</p>
<p>Why did one opinion in the Talmud say that the last verses in Devarim were not written by Moses? Because he had a mesorah? Or was it simply the easiest solution to a very obvious problem? I think it is more elegent to sat that he saw a problem and this was his solution. To say otherwise means that at some point the mesorah was lost and a disagreement developed and the rabbis were merely reporters of their tradition as opposed to Torah giants with ideas of their own.</p>
<p>It is possible that the version I ascribe to more charedi orthodox Jews is correct. But I don&#8217;t think it is correct. It&#8217;s hard to believe that Chazal came along and just explained what was already known to everyone. But even if the charedi version is correct with regard to Chazal, it is almost certainly not correct with regard to the rishonim.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard people say that Rashi on Chumash is a semi-prophetic work. Rashi was Divinely inspired to comment on each verse and his commentary reflects God&#8217;s intended interpretation of the verses. This is a disservice to Rashi. It seems to me that Rashi saw inconsistencies or anomolies in the text and he chose his preferred interpretations from his vast knowledge of Chazal&#8217;s teachings. Rashi saw a problem and Rashi provided the solution.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s easier to see where this is taking us by looking at Ibn Ezra and Rambam. Why did the Ibn Ezra say that there are 7 places in the Chumash that are not original to the text? Was it something handed down to him from his teachers? I don&#8217;t think so. I am fairly certain that Ibn Ezra saw a problem in the text, there was evidence that contravened the accepted (or maybe it wasn&#8217;t accepted at that time) wisdom that every word of the Torah was given to Moses by God and those were the exact same words they had in the 11th century Torah scrolls. His solution was to accept the evidence and change the dogma. Religion cannot contradict truth so Ibn Ezra adjusted the religion accordingly.</p>
<p>Rambam managed to make the Torah consistent with Greek and Arabic philosophy. Do we think that Rambam thought that Greek and Arabic philosophy were handed to Moses from God at Sinai? That&#8217;s preposterous. Rather, Rambam held that the maxims he accepted in those non-Jewish sources were the truth. If they are true, then the Torah must work with Greek and Arabic philosophy. Rambam made it work. It&#8217;s the same idea. Rambam accepted external evidence and then conformed the Torah to make sense in the context of his truth. Truth cannot be changed. But sometimes religious dogma can be changed. Even more surprising is that Rambam did not say &#8220;prove Greek and Arabic philosophy to me and then I will work out the Torah but until then I accept the Torah as truth and all this secular stuff is obviously wrong.&#8221; He simply accepted the secular wisdom as true and conformed Torah to that truth.</p>
<p>This is how the rishonim and Chazal dealt with Torah vs. evidence.</p>
<p>Similarly, when both Chazal and rishonim encountered a verse or section that seemed too unlikely to be literal, they interpreted it metaphorically. We don&#8217;t circumcise our hearts because that verse was deemed allegorical. Rishonim, like Ralbag and Rambam went even further by turning sections that contradicted their common sense into dream-sequences or metaphors. Many rishonim and even some achronim have done the same thing with difficult passages in the Talmud. If it can&#8217;t be explained literally because of evidence then it could be allegorized. (Granted, some achronim felt no pangs of guilt by simply saying that Chazal were incorrect.)</p>
<p>The point to all this is to demonstrate how things have changed. The achronim lived in a time where science and other evidence was used to counter religion, not bolster it. In turn, they began the trend of lifting religion above the fray and arguing that the science or other evidence must be reinterpreted to fit religion. If it could not reinterpreted, it was wrong. This is the paradigm of almost all religions since the Renaissance and Enlightenment. There were exceptions to this rule, but for the most part this rule has held firm for several hundred years. Evolution doesn&#8217;t seem to fit in with Biblical narratives? Despite much more evidence than there is for the erroneous astronomy Rambam used in the Mishneh Torah, religious people all over the world are fighting against evolution. The Bible seems to be a composite work? Religious people reply that it&#8217;s impossible. Chazal seemed to be mistaken about medicine or science or math? Our modern thinking must be wrong, or alternatively the Talmud meant something else, or alternatively nature has changed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s such a different attitude from the way Torah scholars approached evidence for almost 2000 years.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t learn Chumash the same way the rishonim learned Chumash. Instead we learn what the rishonim said about the Chumash. This handicaps us from being too innovative on the one hand and has a way of maintaining tradition on the other hand.</p>
<p>I believe, what R&#8217; Farber is trying to do is to relaunch the ancient way of studying Chumash. How would Chazal or some of the rishonim reacted to the evidence presented by Biblical Criticism? If they were consistent, I believe they would have done something like R&#8217; Farber has done in his long article. I am not commenting on R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s academically leaning conclusions. There are other conclusions that could be reached by the questions raised. But his version is certainly a valid conclusion, especially when one only takes the academic data and for the sake of argument ignores the religious approach.</p>
<p>In his long article R&#8217; Farber allegorizes some things. Other things are seen as products of editing over time. We have seen that allegorization is an acceptable form of interpretation. We have also seen that it was obvious that to Chazal and rishonim that the text of the Torah had been edited. R&#8217; Gordimer and others take issue with both of these devices.</p>
<p>Allegorizing too much of the text could create a problem for people. It might be seen as cannibalizing the Torah. If the narratives are not literal then are they meaningful? R&#8217; Farber says yes. Others seem to say no. I don&#8217;t see a reason to say no. I only see a fear of what might happen if we say no. R&#8217; Farber is trying to lay the groundwork for allegorization not to be a problem.</p>
<p>As to the issue of subsequent editing of the Torah I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s a huge problem. R&#8217; Farber is not saying that random people came around and edited the Torah. I think R&#8217; Farber is saying that the edits were made by prophets. The same way we take the works of the prophets seriously and we take them as divine books, we can take edits to the Bible. Our Tanach is filled with various voices that sound very different. Sometimes these books contradict one another. But it&#8217;s okay because we know that they all came from God and God speaks through each prophet in a different way. If prophets did the same thing to the Torah, it&#8217;s true that this would be a very different way of looking at Torah, but in the end, it&#8217;s just as binding on us. It&#8217;s equally the word of God. <a href="http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6372&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=90" target="_blank">There is a rishon</a> who says something like this with regard to the stories in the Torah.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s approach completely changes what we mean by Torah M&#8217;Sinai as well. But is the belief in our version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai a necessary belief for orthodox Judaism to work? Perhaps not.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s worldview is the articulation of how Revelation and Torah M&#8217;Sinai works. Professor Tamar Ross makes an attempt at this, and I don&#8217;t think it satisfactory (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/12/torah-msinai-according-to-professor-tamar-ross/">Torah M’Sinai According to Professor Tamar Ross</a> ) R&#8217; Farber articulates his beliefs at the end of the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe in Torah Min Ha-Shamayim, that the Torah is from heaven, and that the entirety of the book is nevua (prophecy) and represents the encounter between God and the people of Israel.</li>
<li>I believe in Torah mi-Sinai, meaning the uniqueness of the Torah as being of a higher order than any other work in its level of divine encounter. The story of the revelation at Sinai in the Torah I understand as a narrative depiction of a deeper truth—the Torah is God’s book and the divine blueprint for Israel and Jewish life.</li>
<li>I believe that the Torah is meant to be as it is today and that all of its verses, from “Timnah was a concubine” (Gen. 36:12) to “I am the Lord your God,” are holy.</li>
<li>I believe that halakha and Jewish theology must develop organically from Torah interpretation and not by excising or ignoring any part of the Torah or Chazal’s interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p>They sound pretty safe and pretty reasonable. But I also think that this kind of Torah M&#8217;Sinai is too nuanced to catch on and it sounds too heretical to gain traction.</p>
<p>It seems to me that R&#8217; Farber is trying to use orthodox principles to push orthodox Judaism into a discussion about our sacred texts.</p>
<p>If this is what R&#8217; Farber is doing, and I am pretty sure it is, we can say that he has good intentions. We can also say that it deserves a conversation and not to be shot down as heretical immediately. I was particularly upset that the article on Cross-Currents did not articulate the objections to R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s statements. Instead quotes were mined and the audience was expected to simply conclude that the statements were heretical. It is symptomatic of a larger problem in orthodox Judaism where reason and debate are stifled. Dogmatic proclamations are very much in style. Well argued responsa died with R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein.</p>
<p>Purely for the sake of honest religious debate, I think that R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s approach demands a discussion and not condemnation. But for the social reasons I think there is even more benefit to an inclusive approach. We should not be rooting for a breakaway from orthodoxy by the Left, nor should we even give the appearance of rooting for it. One thing that Yeshiva Chovevei Torah and its community do well, is inclusivity. The times we live in are dark in some ways, but people are more capable than ever before to think on their own and formulate their judgments. I see no benefit to jettisoning an entire group of people and the people who are sympathetic to them because of controversial statements. I am aware that this is a time-honored custom of Jews and religious people everywhere. I just don&#8217;t see the utility in it anymore. Our best defense against losing the battle vs. complete secularism is not insularity and narrowing the playing field. Our best defense is the exact opposite.</p>
<p>If we want to have a small narrow-minded cult that ignores the outside world and in turn is ignored by the outisde world we should continue the trend of ousting people and movements from orthodox Judaism. If we want to keep a foothold in the outside world and carry weight and influence in a world that could certainly use some of our wisdom, we need to keep the broadest base possible.</p>
<p>I hope that R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s article and the entire theTorah.com website can become a springboard for education and discussion. Inclusivity to the maximum should be our goal.</p>

<p><em>Write an article about modesty that is respectful to men and women, makes a case for an orthodox Jewish version of tznius, and it also has to make tznius sound pleasant.</em></p>
<p>Can I do it? This is my attempt.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of <i>tznius</i> in orthodox Judaism. The first is the concept of modesty. The second is the details of how <i>tznius</i> is observed in orthodox Judaism. I admit that it is much easier to make a case for the first aspect than it is for the second. But I submit that once one is convinced of the first aspect, the second aspect becomes much easier. But I am hopeful that we can carve out a third aspect to <i>tznius</i>, if not in practice yet, at least in theory.</p>
<p>The Sefer HaChinuch asks an excellent question. There is a mitzvah to kindle the fire of the altar in the Temple. A priest would light the fire every day. If the Temple needs a fire, someone has to to light it. The problem is that we have a tradition that the fire on the altar came from heaven and thus there was no need for a mere mortal to light the fire.</p>
<p><span id="more-7298"></span></p>
<p>Answers the Sefer HaChinuch, this is the way of God. Whenever God acts in a miraculous way that displays God&#8217;s greatness, God will seek to hide God&#8217;s greatness and make the miracle appear to be natural. There will always be a way to rationalize the miracle as a non-miracle. This explains the requirement that a priest light the fire on the altar. It must appear that God is not acting in a way that is clearly miraculous.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s reasonable to say that God&#8217;s &#8220;moment&#8221; in the Bible was the splitting of the Sea of Reeds. That was the bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, down by three runs, and God hits it out of the park for the win. It&#8217;s the defining moment in our relationship with God until this very day and one of the most dramatic episodes in the Bible. It&#8217;s very interesting to note what is recorded in the Torah before the sea actually split. We are told that Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and strong winds stirred up the sea water all night. The next day God split the sea.</p>
<p>The Chinuch explains that God&#8217;s miracles must be hidden. God could have been a show-off and designed this big moment to be as dramatic as possible. The waters could have been completely still, Moses could have been crying on his hands and knees begging for mercy, and then God would swoop in at the last possible moment and save the Israelites with a grand show. But instead God hid the miracle behind outstretched arms and swirling winds.</p>
<p>This is the way of our God. Our God is modest. Even our all powerful God chooses to limit God&#8217;s exposure when performing miracles. The Chinuch concludes that this is true greatness. One who is great is not one who needs to make a show of oneself. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Jewish modesty. <em>V&#8217;halachta b&#8217;drachav</em>. We emulate God&#8217;s character. <em>V&#8217;hatzneah leches im Elokecha</em>. Walk modestly with your God.</p>
<p>Every person should strive to be Godly. Greatness is found when people don&#8217;t expose everything. This is the paradigm that we learn from God. Overexposure is unGodly.</p>
<p>But what is the reason for this? Is it some rule that can&#8217;t be explained? Or can we make some sense of this?</p>
<p>I think it does have some basis in reality. We are easily distracted. Please note, I am not saying we are perverts or we have a hard time controlling ourselves. I am saying that our minds are biased towards simplicity and gravitate toward the external things that are easily seen. Marketers know this and they distract us with beautiful people in their ads for horse manure. But wisdom and maturity are seeing things that are beneath the surface. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>Of course it is entirely possible for a beautiful naked person to be espousing wisdom. It’s just harder to hear the wisdom. This had nothing to do with Judaism or God. Professors at universities, CEOs, and politicians in our Western society dress at least somewhat formally. We all understand this.</p>
<p>Taken to another level, we all disregard showboaters and over-aggressive, transparent, self-promotors. We dismiss those kinds of people and their ideas are taken far less seriously. Our minds know that greatness is usually not “in your face.” We know that greatness is hidden. I think this is the rational explanation for God&#8217;s behavior in hiding God&#8217;s miracles.</p>
<p>Modesty in Judaism is supposed to reflect this value. It applies equally to men and women and applies equally to clothing as it does to the rest of one&#8217;s life. This is the Jewish concept of modesty. It is the first aspect. It explains the value in limiting one&#8217;s external exposure.</p>
<p>If it ended here, we would all take this lesson to heart and try to make our own decisions in consonance with this ideal. Practices would vary but we would all try to live with this concept in our lives.</p>
<p>But orthodox Judaism is not just about ideas and concepts. The rabbis of the Talmud and their halachic heirs take these concepts and interpret them into laws. These are really old laws. Some are 2000 years old. Other more “recent” laws are only several hundred years old.</p>
<p>Over the millennia, the laws of each time and place were added to our legal codes. The rigid laws of our current <i>tznius</i> standards of clothing, whether from the stringent or lenient extremes are borne out of this system. They don&#8217;t really make sense today. They are not really expected to make sense today. These laws are mostly anachronistic.</p>
<p>Today’s laws seem to draw arbitrary lines about what can be seen and what may not be seen. There is little rhyme or reason and this is a breeding ground for stringencies and false displays of piety. With no firm halachic foundation, it is easy to invent new and improved ideas about <i>tznius </i>that can creep into society and become de facto standards seemingly overnight. Some people draw the line here and others draw the line over there. If you’re in doubt? Cover it up. Better to be safe than sorry. The spirit of <i>tznius </i>can be hard to find under these circumstances.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line it seems, we have collectively lost the ability to adapt our laws for modernity within the confines of halacha. That being said, orthodox Jews conform to halachic standards. Sometimes it&#8217;s not easy, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t really make perfect sense, but it&#8217;s the laws that we have and until they are abrogated they are the laws we must keep. This is the second aspect.</p>
<p>There is no real theological reason that <i>tznius</i> should be so heavily regulated and codified in Jewish law while all the other areas of our lives that require us to act with modesty are left to our whims and desires. Rather it is social. Dress codes and sensuality are things that people have traditionally been concerned with and thus we have a huge compilation of laws associated with <i>tznius</i>. This despite the fact that <i>tznius</i> in the Talmud is barely a blip on a very large radar. when it is mentioned it is mentioned as a restriction against reciting the Shema or matrimonial disputes. It is hardly recognizable as a formulaic dress code.</p>
<p>It can feel like there is a huge disconnect between the first aspect and the second aspect. To me it feels that way sometimes. But sometimes there is a price to pay if one wants to be part of orthodox Judaism. This is the way orthodox Judaism is now. It’s not perfect, but it’s the way the first aspect is attempted to be lived contemporarily.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think it always will have to be this way. Mormons also have very strict modesty laws. Their laws also relate to all areas of one&#8217;s life but there is a dress code as well. Their dress code is updated from time to time. It&#8217;s a modern version of modesty. There are some hard and fast rules, but it is not 17th century modesty. It is modern modesty. One who follows their guidelines would certainly be emulating God&#8217;s modesty of hiding greatness behind a veil.</p>
<p>However, if an orthodox Jew would dress in the Mormon way they would probably be shunned by their orthodox Jewish friends and neighbors. It&#8217;s almost certain that they would be chastised by rabbis and modesty activists. But I would venture to guess that they would be modest and they would be satisfying the Godly standard of the Chinuch.</p>
<p>There are two Judaisms. There is the Judaism between Jew and God and there is the Judaism between Jew and fellow Jew. They are not always the same thing.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is a good example of this. One can be dressed very respectfully, modestly, and Godly but still not follow the laws of <i>tznius</i> as they are practiced in orthodox Judaism today. Conversely, one can follow the letter of the law of <i>tznius</i> and be the complete opposite of Godly. We all know this is true.</p>
<p>Maybe, if there is enough demand and enough people who won&#8217;t look down their noses at people with subjective standards of modesty, the first and second aspects of <i>tznius</i> could be reunited. I don&#8217;t expect it to happen quickly, I don&#8217;t even expect it to happen at all. But it is something to think about.</p>
<p>Perhaps there will be some sort of reformation within orthodox Judaism and the standards of <i>tznius</i> will be updated to modern sensibilities. I think guidelines that are similar to the Mormon regulations would be far less criticized than the standards we have today. This, coupled with a severe toning down of <i>tznius</i> rhetoric, blame, and false promises of salvation would completely change the tenor of the <i>tznius</i> conversation. We should be talking about God&#8217;s <i>tznius</i>. The kind of greatness the Chinuch describes is what our goal should be.</p>
<p>At the very least, I think attempting to emulate God in this manner is valuable. It can improve our lives. We can begin to appreciate the wisdom of universal modesty that applies to men and women in all of our lives. Understanding the circumstances that led to <i>tznius</i> regulations in orthodox Judaism today can also soften the challenge of arcane dress codes at least a little bit. But I think the hopeful part of this article is the most important part. Our collective standards might be able to change if we allow them to change. In our hearts we must know that in theory our goal is to be Godly in a way that is not intended nor should it ever be interpreted as a way to control women, burden women with the brunt of dealing with man&#8217;s animalism, some new-agey feminist form of liberation, or the fundamental way women serve God.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is meant to be a way of emulating God. Let’s bring that back and try to end the current trend of fetishizing <i>tznius.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/israel-jerus-285.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7269" alt="israel-jerus-285" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/israel-jerus-285-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>In many ways Mormons are like American Orthodox Jews. We share many values and our lifestyles are very similar. One thing that we share is the emphasis on modesty. The rules of modesty in Mormonism are far less rigid than they are in orthodox Judaism, but they are taken just as seriously. Their rules sound like 20th century rules and ours sound like 16th century rules. All this makes perfect sense considering when our books of law were codified.</p>
<p>One thing Mormons do at the tender age of 19 is they go on Missions. We have <a href="http://chinuch.org/project_seed.php" target="_blank">Project SEED</a> programs. It&#8217;s basically the same idea.</p>
<p>For many young Mormons it is their first real contact with non-Mormons on a regular basis. Obviously this creates new challenges for the missionaries. It seems that dealing with the relative immodesty of non-Mormons when compared with what they are accustomed to is a particularly difficult challenge.</p>
<p>Mormons are expected to be chaste in every possible way and this can be particularly difficult for young men.</p>
<p>A young man on a Mission where clothing is worn sparingly writes of his personal struggles.<span id="more-7268"></span> It is fascinating to hear him talk in Mormon terms about struggles that he shares with young Yeshiva students. What is most interesting is where he takes the article. I recommend reading the article for its content but also to compare it with our values and terminology.</p>
<p>He wants things to change. In short, he uses anecdotal evidence, scientific studies, and logic to argue that the overemphasis on modesty has the opposite of its intended effect. Instead of making it easier for men it makes it harder for men. Further, it does not ensure that women are thought of in the purest of terms. Finally, it reinforces unfortunate stereotypes about pleasure and intimacy that can have negative consequences later on in life and throughout marriage.</p>
<p>He concludes that it is time to rethink old ideas about sexuality in the Mormon Church.</p>
<p>I sense that a similar conversation is brewing in the orthodox Jewish community. All the talk of Tznius is having an opposite of its desired effect on so many people in our community. It has gone from reasonable to extreme to laughable. Has it even helped anything? What are the tangible benefits of increased modesty to an absurd degree?</p>
<p>Science and soft science have a lot to say about how we are affected by what we see and what we wear. Are we interested in what they say? Is there a way to bridge the gap between the two?</p>
<p>Will a budding Torah scholar with Yeshiva bona fides write an article like this? Are we ready for this conversation?</p>
<p>These are tough questions but I think we will be doing a world of good by trying to answer them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/P3080110.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7250" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/P3080110-300x240.jpg" width="300" height="240" /></a>The war over MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is rising to a crescendo. The mouthpiece of the Ultra-Orthodox American establishment is the Yated Ne&#8217;eman. The Yated and its Matzav.com website are <a href="http://www.yated.com/dov-lipman--bad-choice-to-keynote-rca-convention.7-977-7-.html" target="_blank">leading the charge to discredit and demonize Lipman</a> in every way possible. Meanwhile, the Centrist Orthodox Americans are watching from the sidelines as they watch a potential hero go to zero. The Modern Orthodox Jewish community is becoming enraged as they see their values trudged upon by their charedi brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mess.</p>
<p>Two important voices from the moderate camp have invited Lipman to speak. The RCA Convention will be headlined by Lipman and the BAYT Shul in Toronto is featuring Lipman as a Scholar in Residence the last week in June.</p>
<p>For these grievous sins, Lipman, the RCA, and BAYT have come under a severe assault of attacks from the Yated and Matzav. Articles calling for boycotts of these fine institutions, articles condemning the the decision makers and rabbinic leadership of both institutions, and of course articles enumerating the horrible sins of Lipman as ammunition for their war appear regularly in their pages.<span id="more-7249"></span></p>
<p>The thrust of their arguments against Lipman focus on isolated incidents, out of context quotes, but most of all guilt by association.</p>
<p>I think this is a very important point. There are pundits who &#8220;connect the dots&#8221; to spin conspiracy tales on a daily basis. People believe it. Others just disqualify the opinions or ideas of others because they have a second cousin who gave money to someone else who has a nephew in Al Qaeda. People seem to be okay with this too. For some, guilt by association is actual guilt. For these people, who you know and with whom you associate determine your credibility.</p>
<p>Obviously, this parlor game is ridiculous. If you search long enough you can connect any two people in the world. Guilt by association is terrible way to make a point. Assuming that the two people are associated, there is no evidence that they agree on anything. They could hate each other. Or they could agree on one thing and completely disagree on another. It&#8217;s pure scare tactics and dishonesty to impugn people because of loose ties or even strong ties that they may have with others who might be different or even dangerous.</p>
<p>The same exact thing is happening now in the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish media.</p>
<p>Lipman is in the same party as Yair Lapid? And Lapid&#8217;s father, Tommy, was virulently anti-orthodox? Lipman must also be anti-orthodox! The RCA asked Lipman to speak? The RCA must agree with everything Yair Lapid says too! BAYT invited Lipman for Shabbos? BAYT is clearly anti-Torah.</p>
<p>These are the arguments being made.</p>
<p>The non-Ultra-Orthodox Jews don&#8217;t play this game. They would prefer to hear challenging ideas and thought provoking conversation than disqualify any dissenters by way of guilt by association. Does the RCA agree with every single thing Lipman says? Probably not. No two people agree on everything! Does BAYT co-sign every single thing Lipman has ever done? Of course not. But both institutions pride themselves on appealing to a broad spectrum of orthodox Jews and care passionately about matters of great communal importance. Thus, Lipman is a great candidate for a talk in both places.</p>
<p>But the uber-charedi world it doesn&#8217;t work like that. Unless someone is 100% kosher, they can&#8217;t get to the table. No matter how salient their points may be, they don&#8217;t have the opportunity to be heard. Worse, when two people are associated, and person A says or does something controversial, everyone runs to person B and asks if person B &#8220;holds of&#8221; what person A did. It&#8217;s ridiculous! People can disagree. People can have different opinions. Why is it even expected that if person B associates with person A they would agree with everything person A does? It makes no sense.</p>
<p>This is the best way to seek and destroy any dissent or debate. There is no room for dissent or debate when as soon as someone dissents or debates all that person&#8217;s associates are impugned and they are forced to distance themselves from the dissenter or debater. Nothing could be more chilling.</p>
<p>The other way is to analyze ideas, not people. Rambam writes &#8220;Hear truth from whoever says it.&#8221; These are wise words. The source of an idea is only secondary to the content of the idea. Great people can say stupid things and stupid people can say great things. It&#8217;s terribly insecure and unwise to automatically eliminate so many voices simply because they are guilty by association.</p>
<p>I believe that this is the primary issue that is at play here. Since Lipman is straddling two worlds, he is by definition persona non grata in the Ultra-Orthodox world. One can&#8217;t be for Torah and also cavort with people who are not for Torah. Therefore he is automatically wrong and all the rules of fair play and honesty are no longer relevant. He is a threat who must be stopped. He is not a voice that must be answered. This is the only explanation for the completely disingenuous and false attacks against Lipman.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old argument within orthodox Judaism. For some time now there has been resistance against fostering debate and conversation amongst people with differing views and perspectives. Worse, it has long been established that orthodox Rabbis may not sit on organizations with non-orthodox Jews lest it be perceived as endorsement of non-orthodox values. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a great tactic, nor do I think it&#8217;s wise in the long run. Writing for Tradition Magazine, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/23256285" target="_blank">Rabbi Shubert Spero addressed this issue in 1966</a> and we can see how things have changed since then. Rabbi Spero was writing about engaging non-orthodox Jews. Engaging orthodox Jews wasn&#8217;t an issue in 1966.</p>
<p>Look where we are today. We still don&#8217;t participate with non-orthodox Jews. In fact the <a href="http://matzav.com/the-rca-and-the-women-of-the-wall" target="_blank">Yated recently addressed this very issue</a>, going so far as to compare Reform Jews in the mid-20th century with the Women of the Wall and MK Lipman. The Yated takes for granted that it would be prohibited to work together with Reform Jews, the additional point was that this rule would also apply to WoW and Lipman. In 1966 Rabbi Spero was hopeful that orthodox Jews could participate with non-orthodox Jews. Here we stand in 2013 and orthodox Jews cannot participate with orthodox Jews who associate with non-orthodox Jews! It seems to me we are going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>What will it take to change the tenor of discourse in the orthodox Jewish community? I don&#8217;t know. Maybe an Asifa. An <em>achdus</em> Asifa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gérôme_Jean-Léon_-_Moses_on_Mount_Sinai_Jean-Léon_Gérôme_-1895-1900.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7234" alt="Gérôme,_Jean-Léon_-_Moses_on_Mount_Sinai_Jean-Léon_Gérôme_-1895-1900" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gérôme_Jean-Léon_-_Moses_on_Mount_Sinai_Jean-Léon_Gérôme_-1895-1900-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a>Professor Tamar Ross was interviewed by Professor Alan Brill over at Kavvanah about Torah M&#8217;Sinai and Biblical Criticism. To be honest, when I read the interview I was unable to comprehend what she was trying to say. Only after a lengthy Facebook conversation and some posts by Gideon Slifkin did I get her approach, sort of.</p>
<p>Her words are very dense and quite cryptic but I think this what she is trying to say.</p>
<p>In her opinion, we have two immovable objects. We have Divine Revelation and the requisite belief that God gave the Torah to us in its complete form and we have Biblical Criticism which in her opinion asserts that the Torah has evolved from multiple authors and multiple eras. Something has to give. For most people, ignorance about one or the other is the turning point. People who know more about Biblical Criticism than TMS are more likely to think that the Torah is not Divine. Those who know more about (the Orthodox Jewish) approach to Torah than Biblical Criticism are more likely to think that Biblical Criticism is just a theory or soft science with more biases than religious approaches to Torah.</p>
<p>I am not here to take sides and apparently neither is Professor Ross.<span id="more-7233"></span></p>
<p>Ross&#8217;s basic idea is that &#8220;revelation&#8221; was not a one time thing. The revelation continues as the world progressed and however the Torah was emended or edited after Sinai was part of revelation. In order to make this sound religious, Professor Ross uses all kinds of fancy kabbalistic &#8220;logic&#8221; to make this approach kosher. In short, God is not bound by time so everything is really happening at once. Revelation can&#8217;t be just a moment in time and God is continually revealed through the evolution of Torah. Apparently there are allusions to this kind of theology in classical sources. Also, the thing that make our tradition unique is only that it is our tradition. I&#8217;m not sure how and why this fits in, but she does say it.</p>
<p>Read the entire interview because the bulk of it is really about what this approach is not as opposed to what this approach actually is. But what is it?</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not Orthodox. That&#8217;s for sure. But as has been pointed out, it&#8217;s not that far off. In terms of how the charedi world sees Mesorah and Daas Torah, the assumption is that God is &#8220;signing off&#8221; on the developments of Orthodox Judaism is part and parcel of how charedi Judaism works. So is it so hard to hear that God functioned the same way with regard to how the text of the Written Law evolved? Granted, the Written Law and Oral Law have different parameters and roles and I am not saying that these two ideas are the same. I am merely pointing out that the two ideas are similar.</p>
<p>Is this idea viable or useful?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. First of all, simple ideas are popular. There is a reason that more nuanced positions are less popular than bombastic theories of everything. People like when things are simple. The fundamentalist version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai is simple and not nuanced at all. It&#8217;s also pretty popular. If you want a theory to be popular it needs to be simple. Professor Ross has proposed a very complicated theory that is very difficult to articulate. It&#8217;s not going to gain much traction because of this fatal flaw.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think that an idea like this is not likely to help actual people. People who believe in the fundamentalist version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai don&#8217;t need this. People who reject Torah M&#8217;Sinai are not usually looking for creative way to believe in Torah M&#8217;Sinai. Further, I am not sure that this path will lead people who reject fundamentalist Torah M&#8217;Sinai to mitzvah observance. I think they want to do what God says to do, not what men say to do as a part of God&#8217;s slow revelation.</p>
<p>However, there are a few people in the middle who I am confident that this approach can help. Some people just want some theological basis to be orthodox and this can potentially serve that small group. If we believe in the primacy of keeping Torah and Mitzvos then we should welcome creative ways that are somewhat theologically sound to help more people accomplish this goal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2603_MEDIUM.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7226" alt="2603_MEDIUM" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2603_MEDIUM-300x272.jpg" width="300" height="272" /></a>Yesterday, in an article in Newsday, the world was introduced to the term Tuna Beigel. Now it&#8217;s time to retire it.</p>
<p>A little Googling will yield plenty of results for the term and almost all of them are negative. It&#8217;s used to describe people born to chasidic families who modernize. They keep many of the exterior elements of chasidishe life but lead lives that are not insular at all. They are familiar with popular culture, they have less rigid ideas about modesty, and they live outside the chasidic enclaves. However, I would say that these people are by and large orthodox. If they leave orthodoxy they leave this group.</p>
<p>For non-chasidim, these people can seem odd. They don&#8217;t speak English well, they are under-educated, they have chasidishe foibles and tendencies. Because of these barriers they don&#8217;t really integrate perfectly into the mainstream yeshiva world or into the modern orthodox world. Hence, they have their own group and their own name. The separate name and their lack of integration are an indictment of the frum world. Non-chasidim must do a better job of welcoming those who left insular community. Titles that mock their difficult choice would not a good way of doing this.</p>
<p>The problem is that Tuna Beigel is a pejorative.<span id="more-7225"></span> It is used to mock their Yinglish and I am told that many people use it derisively and many feel derided by the word. Of course there are many people from this group that use the word proudly. They are not insulted by the word at all. But too many people find the term offensive for it to be used in civilized conversation.</p>
<p>Personally, I compare it to using the &#8220;off the derech&#8221; to describe someone who left orthodox Judaism. I try very hard not to use that description because I think it is offensive. It tells those who left orthodox Judaism that they are off the path which implies that they are defective. While it&#8217;s true that orthodox Jews believe there is a path and those who left are not on the path, calling attention to that is implicitly offensive. Now, some people who fit into that category don&#8217;t find it offensive. That&#8217;s cool. But it doesn&#8217;t mean that we should use it. You&#8217;ll not find a single mention of that phrase on this blog unless I am quoting or paraphrasing someone else. That&#8217;s because I find it offensive.</p>
<p>Similarly, the term for modernized chasidim should not be offensive. In fact, I believe they should be celebrated and embraced. They are heroes. They are choosing our life. And it&#8217;s even more impressive that they are staying within the confines of orthodox Judaism even after having left the insular community. That&#8217;s the interesting thing about the article in Newsday. It&#8217;s a growing phenomenon and we hope it continues to grow.</p>
<p>In my private life I don&#8217;t use the word Tuna Beigel. In my public life I do not want to use it either and I don&#8217;t want others to use it. Try Modern Chasidim if you need a title. That&#8217;s what I use and I think it is a respectful and accurate description. (Modern Orthodox doesn&#8217;t work because that group stands for Torah U&#8217;Mada, excellence in secular education and high professional accomplishment. Hopefully the next generation of Modern Chasidim can grow into that.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s stop using this ugly term to describe Modern Chasidim. Let&#8217;s do a better job of helping them integrate into the non-chasidic world. If I offended anyone by my association with the article in Newsday, please forgive me. I admire the Modern Chasidim (and you ex-hasids too) and did not intend to hurt anyone. I hope we can work together to end the use of this term and create a brighter future for those who choose not to stay in the insular chasidic community.</p>
<p>(Also, I think the article is interesting. I was quoted a few times too.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7202" alt="131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>Every group or cause needs a spokesperson. There is no more eloquent a spokesperson for her cause than Leah Vincent. (No offense to the rest of her group intended.)</p>
<p>Leah represented herself and Footsteps quite nicely on Katie Couric&#8217;s show, creatively named Katie. Every story about someone leaving the ultra-orthodox community has the potential to be a huge chillul Hashem and an abject failure. My sense of the segment on Katie was that despite the significant obstacles placed before her, Leah has been very successful in her personal and professional life. The segment veered from a discussion about the flaws or problems in her community. In fact, it almost glossed over them.</p>
<p>If one was looking for a chillul Hashem, I think it would be hard to find one in this segment. It was much easier to see chillul Hashem in previous television appearances by those who left ultra-orthodox Judaism. I think it speaks to Leah&#8217;s dignity and demeanor that the segment was so respectful.<span id="more-7200"></span></p>
<p>Leah&#8217;s story is harrowing. She points to two traumatic incidents in the segment. One ended her childhood and the other ended her life. When her parents cut her off, Leah was forced to live on her own, work minimum wage jobs just to survive. It&#8217;s not clear what her level of observance was at the time, but I gather that she was still orthodox. Unfortunately, this kind of thing happens in our community. It&#8217;s being worked on and hopefully we will see less and less of this odd form of &#8220;tough love&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then she was raped. Leah was obviously trying to control her emotions when she talked about this second traumatic event. She pushed through it displaying great strength and courage. I do wonder what happened to her attacker. Nothing was mentioned about that.</p>
<p>I found it interesting how Leah still calls the world of her childhood &#8220;my sect&#8221;. She still identifies with the community. I guess that&#8217;s a good thing, but I also think it shows how hard it is to leave.</p>
<p>Here is what is a little different about Leah&#8217;s story. She is not from a chasidic background. She got a decent secular education and speaks English perfectly. Others who have left orthodox Judaism, leave with a rudimentary education at best, and a speech handicap that may appear to limit them. Also, being from the non-chasidic world, it is more likely that Leah encountered Jews who were not ultra-orthodox in her childhood. The level of insularity in her world is less than in the chasidic world.*</p>
<p>Which leads me to the real purpose behind the segment. I think the goal was to publicize the work of <a href="footstepsorg.org" target="_blank">Footsteps</a>. On the show, Footsteps was said to provide a safe place for those who left orthodox Judaism and especially ultra-orthodox Judaism. They tend to social and psychological needs as well as practical needs of those who left orthodoxy. People like Leah, who needed friendship and emotional support. Others need help getting GEDs or jobs or speaking English properly.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of orthodox Jews who look at Footsteps as the enemy. They see them as the group that is making it easier to leave and as part of the problem. Or worse, they seem them as evangelizing those who are still in the community and influencing them to leave.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see it this way at all.</p>
<p>The people who need Footsteps are our brothers, sisters, cousins, children, and grandchildren. They are our family. Our system didn&#8217;t work for them. No system can work for everyone. Are we to leave them to die in the streets? If we have not prepared them for life on the outside, we are failing our duty to our own family members. If we do not provide them with warmth and support even after they leave, they must get that love and support somewhere. Footsteps is doing that work.</p>
<p>Of course, I would prefer to see our community provide these services. I would rather we all learn English and earn high school diplomas. I would love it if we could stay connected emotionally to those of us who leave. And we are working on all that. Hopefully we will get there soon. But in the meantime, Footsteps is doing <em>our </em>work by helping those in our community who leave. We must express our dismay that there is a need for Footsteps. We must also express our appreciation for Footsteps. They are doing our holy work of taking care of our children for us.</p>
<p>So long as Footsteps is not actively trying to draw people out of our community I think they should have our support. If they do attempt to subversively foster dissent and revolt, I can&#8217;t see how we can embrace their mission. Either way, we must thank them for taking care of our family members. So, thank you Footsteps.</p>
<p><em>*UPDATE: Leah&#8217;s background is non-conventional. She grew up in a non-insular community but her family tried to live an isolated life.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7137" alt="DoubleLife-Cover" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DoubleLife-Cover-231x300.jpg" width="231" height="300" /></a>I received a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife: One Family, Two Faiths and a Journey of Hope</a> a few weeks ago. It took a while for me to actually  sit down and read the book but I read it over the weekend and will do my usual review with a side of analysis on the book.</p>
<p>The story is quite intriguing. A Jewish man who makes a living playing music at Church and a Christian woman who does the same fall in love, get married, and end up as orthodox Jews. There&#8217;s a lot of blanks to fill in and the book does a fair job of telling their story.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to notice the book&#8217;s most obvious shtick right away. The entire story is told in letters between Harold and Gayle. Harold&#8217;s letters are written in regular typeset and Gayle&#8217;s are in italics. I found this very distracting. I don&#8217;t like italics. But that might be a personal quirk.</p>
<p>The larger issue is that it seems so artificial. Everything is written in letter format. Even things that couples obviously already know about one another. Normal people do not write letters to each other that ask the big questions like &#8220;will we have a Christmas tree or Hanukkah bush in our home&#8221;. Normal couples do not express themselves in letters to the exclusion of anything else. Yet, the book expects us to believe that all these important conversations took place via letters. Either these are real letters, which is just odd or it&#8217;s a gimmick. Making things worse, in order for this to work logistically, the two of them are almost never together. He is writing about his life, she is writing about her life, but because of the format we rarely get a feel for what life is like for the two of them when they are together. Some people might like this format choice, but I did not. It was weird.</p>
<p><span id="more-7134"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> tells the reader a lot about how difficult life can be for intermarried couples. They really don&#8217;t fit in anywhere. The Christian community does not embrace Howard and Gayle and we all know how skeptical the Jewish community can be of intermarried couples. I was surprised that the more liberal branches of Judaism were so antagonistic toward Howard and Gayle. It could just be that this was their experience and others have had different experiences. But reading the book, one would think that Reform and Conservative rabbis and communities are not welcoming to intermarried couples. This might be true in general, but all one can say from the book is that this was the experience of this couple. I would not say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> dishonestly portrays the positions of other denominations to puff up orthodox Judaism, but it at some points it did feel like that a little bit.</p>
<p>The punchline of the book is that the one place that welcomed Howard and Gayle more than any other was the orthodox Jewish community. In the end, despite their reservations, especially Gayle&#8217;s, the couple settled in the orthodox Jewish community. Gayle had a full orthodox conversion and the couple is has been living as orthodox Jews ever since. I do admit to completely breaking down during the conversion scene in the book. It was very emotional and I felt that the book did an excellent job making the moment work as a true climax of the story.</p>
<p>I wish the book would have spent some more time dealing with the theology of becoming an orthodox Jew. Gayle struggles with it quite a bit and we are never really told what changed her mind from resistance to acceptance of orthodox Judaism. I suspect it was mostly an emotional decision but I thought we should have heard a bit more about the transition.</p>
<p>The book tells a great story, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> also seeks to carve out a place for intermarried couples in orthodox Judaism. On the one hand their story seems to say that they are welcome with open arms, but on the other hand it seems that more resources are needed to handle these situations in the orthodox community. To that end <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> promotes the website created by Howard and Gayle for intermarried couples <a href="http://j-journey.org">j-journey.org</a>. The site seems to focus on orthodox conversion exclusively.</p>
<p>This all leads me to the piercing unasked question raised by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. What should be the Jewish approach to intermarriage. In a generation where more Jews intermarry than &#8220;intramarry,&#8221; what is the best way to handle it?</p>
<p>As it stands now, we discourage intermarriage so vociferously that orthodox rabbis will not officiate the ceremony of an intermarried couple. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> seems to indicate that Reform and Conservative rabbis will not officiate either. What chance do we have of ingratiating an intermarried couple back into Judaism if we can&#8217;t participate in their wedding? I am not saying that we should ignore halacha, God forbid. I am only saying that we stack the deck against the intermarried couple that it becomes extremely difficult to include them in our communities. It is something that we need to work on and I think the Bermans are doing good work by trying to make orthodox Judaism more inclusive for intermarried couples.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. It&#8217;s worthwhile to read the book just to sense of the difficulties that intermarried couples encounter in their spiritual journeys. But more importantly, the book raises questions we must answer about how we handle intermarriage in the modern world. If you have read the book, I welcome your thoughts as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gavel31.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7106" alt="gavel31" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gavel31-300x247.jpg" width="300" height="247" /></a>I am not permitted to disclose particular details, but I was privy to the court transcript of the end of the trial and court decision in the custody battle from <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/05/20/another-ex-hasid-loses-custody-of-her-children/" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s post.</a> My general thoughts have not changed. In general, I think that many women are scared that if they leave the ultra-orthodox community they will be forced to forgo custody of their children. This is a legitimate fear. That was my point yesterday.</p>
<p>Today, I will address this case and I will attempt to be brief.</p>
<p>The case is complex and there is no simple solution. Both of the parents are flawed human beings, just like the rest of us. Both parents have some merit to their case. The judge seemed to skew toward the father whenever it was a judgment call and away from the mother when it was a judgment call. The primary issue in the case, as always, is what is the best interest of the child.</p>
<p>One aspect of that was where the children would have less &#8220;confusion&#8221;. With very little support and with a dismissive wave of the hand to the mother&#8217;s expert, the judge ruled that having the children live a new secular life with their mother would be more harmful than continuing the same life with their father.</p>
<p>I think this was the weakest part of the case.<span id="more-7105"></span></p>
<p>The children will still be seeing their mother on a fairly regular basis. Although she is required to adhere to the rules of the children&#8217;s&#8217; school, they will know she is not chasidic like their father is. So it&#8217;s still confusing. I don&#8217;t see how this solves anything.</p>
<p>In other words, the court established as a fact that there would be confusion is she were awarded custody &#8211; this was speculative and rebuttal evidence was not really considered, then the court established that to minimize confusion the father should be awarded custody &#8211; this doesn&#8217;t seem to solve the problem. This was the extent to which religious values and practices were applied in the case. It was purely with regard to &#8220;confusion&#8221;.</p>
<p>In terms of this case, I think the evidence to support custody on either side was weak. Neither side made a great case. The &#8220;confusion&#8221; section of the decision was particularly speculative (which is ironic considering how the judge dismissed some evidence in favor of the mother because it was too speculative). In the trial transcript the judge clearly said that the mother has the right to choose to leave orthodox Judaism, however she cannot make that choice for her children. I found that troubling. I wonder how old or how young a child must be for a parent to have the right to take their child out of orthodox Judaism? Maybe never?</p>
<p>In terms of the general issues this case raises, I think there are some legitimate concerns. First, like I said above, I think that losing child custody is a fear that many women have when they consider leaving orthodox Judaism. I am not sure this is the best tactic for keeping people in the fold nor do I think it is a positive message from the Frum community. But I think this case opens the door to fighting this presumption. The court relied heavily on the &#8220;confusion&#8221; for the children if their mother was no longer ultra-orthodox. This can be rebutted. It might take some time, it might take some better experts, but by no means is this a <em>fait accompli. </em>Further, the court seemed to have been much more amenable to joint custody solutions if the mother would have committed to even the slightest observance. There is room in the most liberal sects of modern orthodoxy for very relaxed observance. It seems that this would have been enough to allay fears of confusion. This just goes to show how little sense the &#8220;confusion&#8221; issue makes.</p>
<p>In sum, the case was decided on several issues. It was a harsh decision that I don&#8217;t think solves the issues it purports to solve. It was not a purely religious decision. It seems that this case need not be a case that will impact future cases of women in similar situations if the chips fall just a little bit differently.</p>
<p>I empathize with the mother in this case, but I do not feel that the sole issue in the case was religious observance. It may have played to prominent a role, but I have a feeling she may have lost custody even if &#8220;confusion&#8221; was not at issue here. In the end, it is extremely painful to read, let alone experience, a judge deciding the fate of a family. I can only imagine what kind of pain the entire family is experiencing. In particular, the mother, who lost custody must be completely beside herself. I wish her much strength in putting the pieces back together and finding happiness and success in the next phase of her life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1776.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7022" alt="1776" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1776-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>Lag B&#8217;Omer is on Sunday. This means the entire State of Israel (and many Jewish areas around the world) will be lit with bonfires, the city of Safed and Meron will host thousands of pilgrims to the grave of R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai, schools will take their students on outings, some people will watch great rabbis shoot a bow and arrow, young boys will get their first haircuts, charity will be given for holy water, and songs will be sung to remember R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai. This is all aside from all proliferation of bogus Lag B&#8217;Omer segulos that bombard us.</p>
<p>These are all Lag B&#8217;Omer traditions that are a part of our culture.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all great fun and all, and I don&#8217;t mean to rain on anyone&#8217;s parade (or bonfire) but we do need to question whether these activities are appropriate.<span id="more-7021"></span></p>
<p>Lag B&#8217;Omer is a very recent holiday. It&#8217;s not in the Mishna, Talmud, Geonim, Rishonim, Shulchan Aruch, or Rema. Because it is not found in our traditional books and sources, it is worth thinking about the contemporary celebrations of Lag B&#8217;Omer in the broad context of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>If I would tell you that there is a holiday where people make a pilgrimage to a tomb, light bonfires, dance around the fires, give money for holy water, sing songs about a great man, and make a religious ceremony out of a haircut, would you think that sounded like a traditional Jewish holiday? It wouldn&#8217;t to me. To me it sounds a bit pagan.</p>
<p>And it makes sense that it doesn&#8217;t sound familiar to the Jewish ear, because it is a new holiday which was certainly influenced by outside factors.</p>
<p>There are many halachic concerns regarding some of these practices. Just because they are done, does not mean they are right. Certainly it is possible to participate in all the Lag B&#8217;Omer fun and excitement without violating halacha. But it is not an easy task. If anyone starts to think that R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai is praying on their behalf, that could be idol worship. Or if someone venerates R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai as a spiritual power, that could be idol worship. If the haircuts at three years old at a tomb are borrowed from idol worship, it&#8217;s a problem. If giving money for holy water is a borrowed from Christianity, it&#8217;s a problem. Relying on charms and magic is a problem.</p>
<p>So you see, it&#8217;s not so simple to celebrate the new holiday of Lag B&#8217;Omer.</p>
<p>But the most important question we have to ask ourselves is why are we celebrating Lag B&#8217;Omer in this manner? How did this happen? How did it come to be that a holiday which was invented in the last few hundreds years has become a very religiously significant event? So much so that people will read this post and wonder if I am orthodox? How did this happen?</p>
<p>And one last question: Should R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai really be our biggest rabbinic hero? See this post on DovBear for more that: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/05/mitzvoth-not-magic-or-what-about-r.html">Mitzvoth not magic: Or what about R. Yehuda?</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, but I don&#8217;t think we will like the answer if we ever find out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6895" alt="clip_image002" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/clip_image002-300x248.gif" width="300" height="248" />Professor Jack Wertheimer of the Jewish Theological Seminary (Conservative &#8211; not the Commentary Magazine kind, the Jewish kind) published a lengthy, <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-outreach-revolution/" target="_blank">thorough article on kiruv in the orthodox Jewish community</a>. It comes on the heels of two consecutive Klal Perspectives Journal issues on kiruv. He even quotes one article from KP.</p>
<p>First of all, Wertheimer gets kiruv and he gets the issues it creates. I commend him for writing an article as outsider while somehow grasping many of the nuances of kiruv in the orthodox Jewish world. It was very well done. I was impressed. That being said, he does make a few points that don&#8217;t pass the smell test.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the good observations. First, the article combines Chabad outreach and &#8220;everyone else&#8221;. I am not sure that makes sense. Chabad mostly functions independently of the rest of orthodox Judaism, especially in kiruv. Wertheimer comments that Chabad is sometimes viewed disparagingly by the non-Chabad orthodox Jews and even by the non-kiruv Chabad community. So while the numbers of of kiruv workers are staggering if one includes Chabad, it&#8217;s not so clear that they should be included in the same category as everyone else. Aside from the differences in perspective and allegiances, Chabad outreach is not always outreach, Wertheimer notes. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a service. Is a public service the same as kiruv? Maybe. But many non-Chabad people would say it is not.</p>
<p>The article proposes that the large number of kiruv workers is partially a result of more orthodox Jews who need jobs. This is true. For some people, kiruv is a paycheck. This might explain some of the diminished returns. The numbers in the 1990&#8242;s were higher than they are now. When it was a &#8220;calling&#8221; one could expect more success. Now it is just a job for a lot of people. That might make a difference.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about the article for me was that Wertheimer claims that in confidence non-Chabad kiruv workers told him that they consider it a success even if a prospect does not become orthodox.</p>
<p><span id="more-6894"></span></p>
<p>It is a success even if the prospect is more likely to attend a conservative or reform service. This surprised me. It does not reflect my experience. But while I concede that kiruv workers may be satisfied with that kind of return, their donors are not. Wertheimer notes that donors expect a greater return on their investment. &#8220;<em>Donors are increasingly linking their largesse to quotas: One funder insists that each campus outreach worker must reel in at least seven college students annually. Not surprisingly, these pressures have resulted in creative bookkeeping — and demoralization when unrealistic goals cannot be met.&#8221; </em> I alluded to this in my kiruv article as well. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/28/a-different-kiruv-paradigm/">A Different Kiruv Paradigm</a>)</p>
<p>Werheimer&#8217;s estimated numbers are staggering. He estimates that the &#8220;<em>collective impact of Orthodox outreach may touch between a half million and 700,000 Jews each year, rivaling the impact of the Conservative and Reform movements, and in the majority of cases complementing and enhancing the work of those important movements. </em>To think that we have that kind of influence among the other denominations is incredible.</p>
<p>He goes through some of the tension between orthodox kiruv workers and non-orthodox rabbis as well. One thing I had not thought of was the free Bar Mitzvah lessons and free admission to services on the High Holidays severely cutting into the bottom line of conservative and reform congregations. This is an area that needs to be addressed. We cannot cannibalize non-orthodox institutions.</p>
<p>Also mentioned is the questionable practices of using chicanery or smooth-talking to bait kiruv prospects. It&#8217;s deplorable and he could have spent even more time on it.</p>
<p>Further, the article notes that kiruv is not really a great match for today&#8217;s insular frum communities. He quotes the excellent article by Rabbi Ilan Feldman in Klal Perspectives. <em>“To effectively inspire people to become observant, the effort must be done in isolation from the established Orthodox community,” Rabbi Ilan Feldman laments. “Frum communities as cultures are simply not conducive to outreach.”</em> This is lamentable, but true. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/20/one-excellent-article-from-the-new-klal-perspectives-kiruv-issue/">One Excellent Article From Klal Perspectives Fall 2012 on Kiruv</a>)</p>
<p>The article concludes on a hopeful note. Wertheimer hopes that the ad hoc collaboration of kiruv with non-orthodox institutions can bolster American Jewry. <em>&#8220;The American Jewish community can rely upon a new resource to complement existing religious movements, synagogues, and educational institutions in their collective mission to inspire Jews of all ages to draw closer to their religious tradition.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>One thing that seemed improbable to me was the assertion that most kiruv success stories are formerly conservative Jews. My experience has been the complete opposite. That is, the <em>less </em>one knows about Judaism, the more likely one is to become frum. Conservative Jews are pretty educated and usually are passionate about their traditions. These are the people that are least likely to jump ship and go the orthodox route. Yet, for some reason Wertheimer asserts that they are the most likely. The entire article is devoid of footnotes. This is one area that the omission of footnotes is especially glaring. Perhaps Werhteimer&#8217;s conservative roots are coloring his perspective here.</p>
<p>But the most glaring issue to me was Wertheimer&#8217;s assumption that this is considered &#8220;working together&#8221;. He paints this whole thing as orthodox rabbis working <em>with </em>theconservative and reform movement. As if it&#8217;s some kind of partnership. I don&#8217;t agree. A partnership is where two groups work together. Kiruv can at best be viewed as supplementary. I think that calling it a partnership is a bit disingenuous at this point.</p>
<p>What are we to make of this article?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s remarkable that kiruv is such a huge industry that it is being written up in somewhat glowing terms by a conservative Jewish professor. The assumption has always been that kiruv is viewed as the enemy by non-orthodox Jews. It certainly did not feel that way reading Wertheimer&#8217;s article.</p>
<p>More importantly, an outsider who understands kiruv has some great advice. I think his criticisms must be considered.</p>
<p>But above all, I think we need to rethink the entire paradigm. We, as orthodox Jews, should be able to figure out a way to work together with the non-orthodox for real. Not just as supplements and not just as a safety net. We should be permitted and we should be able to partner in events and programs in which we share common goals. We should seek out such events and make them a priority. Wertheimer insinuates that orthodox Jews no longer view non-orthodox Jews as an enemy. This is only slightly true in some less insular quarters. But we can make it true for all orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, the war is over. No one is really deciding between orthodox Judaism and conservative or reform Judaism. Now the battle is all the denominations vs. secularism and apathy. We are on the same team now. It&#8217;s time to take kiruv to the next level and integrate with non-orthodox Jews for the sake of friendship and brotherhood. It can&#8217;t just be for the sake of kiruv. Those days are gone. Now it is time for real kiruv &#8211; closeness. A closeness for the pure sake of being close.</p>
<p>I think this article tells us that we can do just that. Now let&#8217;s do it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6883" alt="Stout_Fox_and_Sage_Hedgehog" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Stout_Fox_and_Sage_Hedgehog-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" />One of the books I am reading now is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159420411X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=159420411X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail  but Some Don&#8217;t</a> by Nate Silver. It&#8217;s an excellent book and I highly recommend it. Perhaps a full review of the book will find its way onto the blog. In the meantime, I want to explore something Silver mentions in the book.</p>
<p>While talking about the general buffoonery of political pundits in the media, Silver notes that people are drawn to bombastic, all-encompassing predictions and most people are not very impressed with nuanced, unsure predictions. He doesn&#8217;t say this in the book, but that&#8217;s why Rush Limbaugh is so popular. He says everything with an air of absolute authority. Whether he right or wrong plays no role in how many people judge him. Subconsciously, we are all very impressed with someone who is assertive and unequivocal. When someone tries to explain why things are not so simple, we get bored and lose interest.</p>
<p>To illustrate this phenomena, Silver draws upon the well known poem &#8220;The Hedgehog and the Fox.&#8221; Isaiah Berlin wrote the poem in 1953 but it just as relevant today as it was then. The poem divides the great thinkers of the world into two categories.</p>
<p><span id="more-6882"></span></p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8230;hedgehogs, who view the world through the lens of a single defining idea (examples given include Plato, Lucretius, Dante, Pascal, Hegel, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Ibsen, and Proust) and foxes who draw on a wide variety of experiences and for whom the world cannot be boiled down to a single idea (examples given include Herodotus, Aristotle, Erasmus, Shakespeare, Montaigne, Molière, Goethe, Pushkin, Balzac, Joyce, Anderson).</em></p>
<p>Silver contends that most of us are hedgehogs and we like hedgehogs, especially in the media. People like soundbites and hedgehogs produce soundbites, Foxes do not. Silver advises us to try to be more like foxes and see nuance. Nothing is as simple as hedgehogs make it seem.</p>
<p>When I read this part of the book I thought about the state of orthodox Judaism and Judaism in general today.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve become very hedgehog-ish. By that I mean that we are dogmatic and tend to oversimplify great issues. Take the way many secular Jews think abuot orthodox Jews, it&#8217;s not nuanced, it&#8217;s based on stereotypes, and is usually not accurate. Take the way orthodox Jews think about secular Jews, it&#8217;s not nuanced, it&#8217;s based on old tropes, and is usually not very accurate.</p>
<p>When it comes to issues within the orthodox Jewish community, we do the same. Everything and everyone is labeled. Issues are called crises. Leaders are oftentimes quoted in simplistic terms without regard for specific situations and circumstances.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the &#8220;crisis&#8221; of people from orthodox homes leaving orthodox Judaism. People are looking for the &#8220;reason&#8221; or the &#8220;solution&#8221; but things are not so simple. I know many people who left orthodox Judaism. They all have their own story, their own reasons, and their own lives. There is no one reason. There is no one solution. But as hedgehogs, we think there should be one. To me, the only solution to this issue is to view people as people with choices and sometimes people make choices we are not happy with. Our job is to provide every orthodox child the opportunity to thrive. Do we do that? I don&#8217;t think so. Can we do that? Maybe not. The point is that it&#8217;s complicated. People want to hear a simple sound bite that will solve everything. Many speakers and writers try to do that. But in the end, it&#8217;s all foam with no beer. It all sounds good, but each individual situation needs specific attention. There is no silver bullet.</p>
<p>The people we tend to hear are people that proclaim that there is a unified theory to answer our questions. The people that get the biggest platforms are the ideologues with a single position approach to whatever they are asked. Chasidus and chumros are popular now because it&#8217;s easier to just buy into a system of extremism. It&#8217;s hedgehoggery at its finest.</p>
<p>But orthodox Judaism is complex. It&#8217;s okay to have questions and it&#8217;s okay to sense tension and contradictions. That&#8217;s where beauty is found. Pundits are popular, but they are fleeting. They have their time in the sun. Beauty and pleasure come from more nuanced and sophisticated views. It&#8217;s like the difference between a hotdog and a masterfully prepared steak. Sure the hotdog tastes good. But one who appreciates finer things wants to enjoy the complexity of an excellent steak.</p>
<p>We should not settle for simplistic approaches to anything, and certainly not orthodox Judaism. Let&#8217;s not expect everything to fit into a neat and tidy box with a ribbon and a bow. Life is complicated. Judaism is complicated. Let&#8217;s seek out the most nuanced and sophisticated positions within orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Returning to ideas secular Jews and orthodox Jews have about one another for a moment. Is anything ever so simple? Let&#8217;s take the time to become more familiar with one another. We should strive to understand and appreciate each other. If we approach life more like foxes, we are bound to understand more about the world and the people around us. I think that would wonderful.</p>

It was a good choice. As usual, I will review and also discuss some of the parts of the book I found most interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius</a> is as much a biography of the Vilna Gaon as it is an examination of the Gaon&#8217;s milieu. Stern compares and contrasts the Gaon with central figures from history and his contemporaries in an effort to paint a more complete picture of the Gaon. It seems that Stern is trying to portray the Gaon as a bit of a reformer who can be associated with modern orthodox Judaism as opposed to modern haredi Judaism.</p>
<p>Honestly, after reading the book I was not convinced of this. It sounds almost ridiculous and the book does not provide a compelling enough case to change my mind. But it was a valiant effort. In this respect the book was a failure. However <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius</a> is a monumental success so many other ways that the thesis of the book is almost an irrelevant side show.</p>
<p>One interesting side show was the discussion of the centrality of Creation Ex Nihilo. According to Stern, the Gaon held that there was no creation from nothing, rather all creation was from &#8220;something eternal&#8221;. This goes to the phenomena of certain interpretations gaining popularity and the rest of the interpretations becoming dinosaurs. The Gaon disagreed with Rambam on Creation Ex Nihilo and I never even heard about it. Fascinating.<span id="more-6823"></span></p>
<p>My favorite chapter in the book compared and contrasted the Gaon and Moses Mendelsohn. Most people assume that Mendelsohn was a reformer and the Gaon was a traditionalist. In some ways that is true. But as far as the way they interpreted the Torah in their commentaries, Mendelsohn expressed much greater deference to Chazal than the Gaon. In his Biur, Mendelsohn argued in favor of Rabbinical interpretations of the Torah in order to distinguish Judaism from the Christian neighbors to his fellow German Jews. Emancipation from the Ghetto brought on challenges of debating and dealing with Christian scholars. Thus, his greatest weapon was to argue for the Rabbinic tradition. The Gaon was cloistered in Vilna. There were no theological challenges from Christians. The challenges were different. The Gaon gave his own interpretations to verses where he didn&#8217;t want to go with the interpretation of Chazal.</p>
<p>The Rashbam is known to disregard many of Chazal&#8217;s interpretations. Mendelsohn was very wary of the Rashbam. He didn&#8217;t like. The Gaon loved the Rashbam and used the Rashbam&#8217;s methodology even where the Rashbam himself did not. The Gaon had no problem saying that Deuteronomy was prophesied by Moses, as opposed to dictated at Sinai, while Mendelsohn would not even concede that the last 8 verses in the Torah were written by Joshua.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Gaon encouraged a translation of Euclid into Hebrew where Mendelsohn translated the Torah into German. Both men were influenced by their social conditions. In the end, this made Mendelsohn into an apologist and the Gaon into a relevant leader.</p>
<p>I posted an excerpt of the book on Facebook. It generated a lot of discussion there so I will direct you there for the comments. (Here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101421218867825" target="_blank">Facebook.com</a>) The excerpt contrasts the Gaon&#8217;s defiant stance against Hasidut and ambivalence toward the Haskala. This is further reflected by his rabbinic legacy in R&#8217; Chaim Volozhin and the Netziv who accepted on the fence <em>maskilim</em> into the Volozhiner Yeshiva. Much of the Gaon&#8217;s opposition to Hasidut was based on the fairly recent memory of Shabtai Tzvi. But the Gaon did not have a problem with the Ramchal and R&#8217; Yonason Eybeshutz who were rumored Shabatean sympathizers. His problem was the movement of Hasidut.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting is that contemporary Hasidic movements want to include the Gaon in their worldview and sometimes reinterpret or apologize for the Gaon. It&#8217;s hard to take these ideas seriously when one has the full picture of the Gaon&#8217;s approach to Hasidut.</p>
<p>Although the Gaon was a great kabbalist, it seems that he was not a mystic in the sense that he would not emphasize or rely upon modern miracles or stories of fantastic occurrences. Some like to attribute his greatness to a magical ability or a special soul. The Gaon&#8217;s students taught that the Gaon was a self made man. Anyone could be the Gaon. He had no gifts or supernatural abilities. His greatness came from his dedication and commitment to Torah and study. His intense discipline and anti-social tendencies opened the doors to greatness. Not something that was given to him from on High. Further, Stern argues that he rejected the Daas Torah model that was made popular by the Chasam Sofer.</p>
<p>In the end, the book is an excellent read. The Notes section is almost as thick as the content section. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius</a> is an impressive book that offers much more than what it purports to do. I highly recommend it. If you need a book for some Pesach reading, pick one up today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6777" alt="Choices" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Choices-300x239.jpeg" width="300" height="239" />The Forward deserves a lot of credit for publishing a <a href="http://forward.com/articles/172778/a-mother-is-who-i-am/?p=all" target="_blank">very nice article written by Rachel Freier</a> about the joys of Hasidic motherhood. Unlike Judy Brown, Freier is still part of the Hasidic community and she argues that being a <em>yiddishe momme</em><em> </em>is who she is. It defines her. She argues that the pressure and value placed on having children in the Hasidic community is vital and a beautiful part of her lifestyle. It is what makes her life worth living.</p>
<p>Freier is an attorney. I don&#8217;t know for sure, but I think she might be the only Hasidic woman who is a lawyer <em>(NOT INCLUDING LUBAVITCH).</em> As an orthodox Jew, I am very proud of women like Rachel Freier. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/" target="_blank">With all the talk of whether women can &#8220;have it all&#8221;</a>, she is a example of someone who does have it all. She has a family &#8211; 6 kids. She has a career &#8211; a law practice. She has religion &#8211; Hasidic Judaism. She has it all. As a role model, I think she is an excellent person for orthodox Jewish women to emulate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also inspiring to see someone who has it all, coming back to their role as a parent, and in her case as a mother as the thing she values most and as the part of her life that defines her. I cannot say it with any more conviction &#8211; More Rachel Freiers please!</p>
<p>But, and you just had to know there was a &#8220;but&#8221; coming, I don&#8217;t entirely agree with her approach.<span id="more-6776"></span></p>
<p>I think Freier makes a mistake that a lot of women with traditional values make. They think that feminism or modern gender roles seeks to eliminate the traditional homemaker or <em>yiddishe momme</em> from society. Therefore, they will argue that there is a lot of value and beauty in traditional roles where women are mostly mothers and wives.</p>
<p>But that argument is not a counter argument to feminism. It is not a counter argument to the Deborah Feldmans and Judy Browns of the world. All they are arguing is that women should have a <em>choice</em>. If a young woman wants to marry after a couple dates, great. If a woman want to have children right away, great. If a woman wants to have a large family, great. But what if they don&#8217;t? Should they be pressured? Should they be forced? Should they feel like they must do what they don&#8217;t want to do?</p>
<p>Brown, Feldman, feminists, etc. want women to have choices. Freier is happy with her life. That&#8217;s great. Really. I hope many women can follow in her footsteps. I am happy for her and for the thousands and thousands of women who chose motherhood, or even if they merely accepted motherhood, but did so with exuberance and gusto. But there are too many women (and men too) who would like to have options.</p>
<p>By limiting options, traditionalists are implying that with a choice, too many would opt out. That doesn&#8217;t make for a very compelling case to opt in. So what I suggest strong, successful, more traditional women in the Hasidic and non-Hasidic communities do, is join the voice of the progressives who want women to have that choice and then and only then make their case for traditionalism. Don&#8217;t make the case for traditionalism and hope to head off anyone from rejecting it. Give our daughters every option available to them and guide them, teach them what values you think are important. If they buy in, great. If not, they will be productive, happy, contributing members of society in other ways. They may have but a few children instead of half a dozen or more. Or they may postpone motherhood for a few years. Let them. Please.</p>
<p>Rachel Freier had options. She is a lawyer. Clearly, she has excellent command of the English language. But far too many of the young women in her community are deprived of the tools that would enable them to have a choice and they march in lockstep to a sit in date at 17, the bridal canopy at 18, and the maternity ward at 19, and at 21, and at 23, and so on.</p>
<p>I know that Freier does not appreciate this point because of her law school anecdote. She took a brave stance in her law school classroom discussion on abortion and argued that abortion should not be legal because <em>&#8220;having children is a blessing and each day that I gave birth was the most memorable day of my life. The joy of motherhood cannot be properly described in a law school casebook.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great argument in favor of someone <em>electing</em> not to abort a pregnancy. It is <em>not</em> a valid argument against giving women a choice about aborting a pregnancy. I am not arguing that abortion is good, bad, or otherwise. There are perhaps very good arguments to ban abortion. The joy of motherhood is not a valid argument when the potential mother does not want that joy or maybe she doesn&#8217;t even feel it. This anecdote shows that Freier misses the point on the choice to have an abortion and on the march to motherhood. Women should have choices, so long as they are moral and justifiable in one&#8217;s legal and ethical code. There is nothing in halachic Judaism that should prevent a young woman from having a choice.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget, that there are many women in the Hasidic community who would never let their daughters attend law school. Would Ms. Freier not argue that even Hasidic women should have that option?</p>
<p>We love our <em>yiddishe mommes. </em>They play a very important role in the future of our people. We want our <i>yiddishe mommes</i> to want to be <em>yiddishe mommes</em> and embrace that role. But it&#8217;s only one role. It need not be the only role.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6770" alt="Thomas_Nagel_teaching_Ethics" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Thomas_Nagel_teaching_Ethics-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" />Thomas Nagel, a well known philosopher, recently published a controversial book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199919755/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0199919755&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank">Mind and Cosmos</a>. I have not read the book. But I have read a lot about the firestorm it has generated.</p>
<p>Nagel is an atheist scientist  / philosopher and he has upset his peers because his book rejects some nearly universally held scientific positions. I am not completely familiar with all the nuances nor the explanations of the nuances of the disagreement but I can describe the broad strokes of the issue.</p>
<p>It seems that the standard opinion among scientists today holds that everything is material, including consciousness. In other words, everything can be explained evolutionarily. Everything. Including the one thing that makes humans different than animals, that is, our consciousness. Nagel argues that consciousness is not material. He argues that humans have something that is quantitatively different than animals and that our consciousness did not simply evolve as everything else has evolved. Nagel remains staunchly atheist and does not attribute this &#8220;thing&#8221; to God.</p>
<p>Just the subtitle of the book would be enough to raise hairs: <em>&#8220;Why the Materialist Neo-Darwinian Conception of Nature Is Almost Certainly False&#8221;<span id="more-6769"></span></em></p>
<p>For deviating from the orthodox scientific position, Nagel has been abused, maligned, outcast, and insulted. Indeed, the tables here are turned. Nagel is a heretic of heresy. He is rejecting a nearly universally held position amongst his peers. One could say that despite his theological beliefs, he is more like Maimonides or Spinoza <em>(l&#8217;havdil)</em> than Dawkins or Hawking.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is not that his ideas are rejected by nearly everyone in his field, the interesting thing is the reasons for their outrage.</p>
<p>One reason for outrage is simply because some believe his science is shoddy or flat out wrong. This is fair and we can expect scientists to disagree on matters that cannot be measured.</p>
<p>But the second reason for outrage interests me much more. Some scientists are arguing that Nagel&#8217;s book is dangerous because it can be construed to lend credence to Intelligent Design and anti-Science religious groups. They accuse Nagel of cavorting with the enemy. In other words, they are more concerned about how his book will be used by the wrong people than they are about the actual content.</p>
<p>Now, I think most of us would agree that this is silly. If the ideas are true then what&#8217;s the problem? If the ideas are being used incorrectly, show those who are using them incorrectly the folly of their ways. Don&#8217;t silence a voice because it might assist your philosophical opponent. That hardly seems honest.</p>
<p>Yet, this is eerily reminiscent of book bans in the orthodox Jewish world. Sometimes the books themselves are not necessarily bad or wrong, but what might happen to people who read them, or what might happen if the information is misunderstood, or misused is the reason for a ban. This kind of thing happens all the time, even outside the context of bans on books. We often her that something is not &#8220;wrong,&#8221; but it could be dangerous, so it should not be publicized.</p>
<p>So what are we to make of this brouhaha? Well, first of all, we see that when it comes to some ideas in the science community there is an orthodoxy that is not very different than orthodoxy within religious circles. There are acceptable ideas and there are unacceptable ideas and sometimes their acceptability does not depend on the merits, sometimes it depends on conformity.</p>
<p>If this kind of group-think, pressure to conform, orthodoxy exists in science, and it does to a small degree, can it be any wonder that it will exist in religious groups? Certainly not. It&#8217;s presence is not an absolute evil, rather it is a fact of life and must be dealt with, lest it control us. Some people express anger over this orthodoxy and standard of conformity in the orthodox Jewish world. It can definitely be frustrating, but it might help to realize that every group has orthodox beliefs. It&#8217;s not just us.</p>
<p>Further, challenging commonly held ideas is risky business. No one comes away unscathed. Whether it is in reputation, confidence, relationships, or whatever, going against the grain takes courage and is likely to yield uncomfortable results. Tread carefully.</p>
<p>But perhaps most of all, Nagel&#8217;s opponents are correct. Nagel&#8217;s book does give the believer a glimmer of hope in a scientific world that is perceived as anti-religion. Thanks to Nagel, it is possible that even within the scientific community, not everything can be attributed to pure materiality. Nagel won&#8217;t call it God, but perhaps we can.</p>
<p>Thank God for Thomas Nagel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6755" alt="Hands on a globe" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/HandsEarth-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" />While I was away, two prominent public figures in the orthodox Jewish world embarrassed themselves.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Manis Friedman compared getting raped to having diarrhea among other vomit inducing statements on abuse and Dov Hikind dressed up in blackface for Purim. We need not reconsider the incredible stupidity of both of these decisions. R&#8217; Friedman fake apologized and then halfheartedly apologized later. Hikind didn&#8217;t apologize and then sort of apologized later.</p>
<p>But what happened? Why did they make such incredible faux pas?</p>
<p>Orthodox Jews live in insular communities. I think that a symptom of insularity is tunnel-vision. We see things the way that our small group of similarly minded people see something. We are infrequently exposed to alternative views when our peers and community reflect very similar values and ideas to our own.<span id="more-6754"></span></p>
<p>Almost every orthodox Jew must deal with this at some point. Our schools, shuls, neighborhoods, little leagues, shops and stores, restaurants, and social gatherings are almost exclusively with people who are just like us. We even have our own media (along with secular media bans to boot!). Diversity is rare and not especially valued. This is not necessarily a bad thing. But there are going to be some side effects.</p>
<p>One side effect is that we may be completely unaware of how the rest of the civilized world feels about certain things.</p>
<p>Growing up, there was a racial slur that I heard very often. I guess in the back of my mind I knew it was not appropriate, but it was part of the vernacular of the social environment I was part of. One Shabbos evening, when I was a campus rabbi at USC, I had some students over and we were talking outside as they were about to leave. A name came up and I said something like &#8220;I thought they were [racial slur - (not the N word)]. The second I said it, I regretted it. I realized immediately that it was totally inappropriate. The reaction of my politically correct college student guests was enough to send me digging a grave beneath my feet. I apologized right away, but I should not have said it in the first place.</p>
<p>I am not excusing my behavior. However, it was new for me to be outside the comfort zone of my insular community. No one would have looked twice if I had said that word among our community. But now I was on the outside. It was trial by fire. Saying that word in the real world is wrong and everyone knows it.</p>
<p>Attending Law School was an amazing experience for me. I got to meet and talk with people from all sorts of backgrounds and with all kinds of different ideas. For the first time, I was engaging people with backgrounds that were different than my own as a peer. It changes you. It makes you a better person. For better or worse, most orthodox Jews don&#8217;t get that experience.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that neither R&#8217; Manis or Dov Hikind meant to be offensive or racist. They just had no idea how their ideas would sound or look to people on the outside. That&#8217;s a symptom of being surrounded by people who don&#8217;t interact with people on the outside.</p>
<p>If before he answered that question, I told R&#8217; Friedman that sex abuse can be deadly, it can drive people to suicide, it can destroy one&#8217;s life, and he believed me, and he understood what I was saying, he would never have said what he said. But I presume that no one ever told him that. That&#8217;s becuase no one has been telling orthodox Jews the truth about sex abuse until very recently and very timidly at that. It&#8217;s getting better, but the degree of misinformation highly outweighs the appreciation of the truth about abuse in our communities. So it&#8217;s no surprise that R&#8217; Friedman made comments that nearly caused me to lose my lunch and had me so upset for a few days. He didn&#8217;t know better. And how would he considering our insularity?</p>
<p>If before Purim, I told Dov Hikind that blackface was considered inappropriate in the 60&#8242;s and asked a few black people to explain why it bothers them so much, I am sure he would never would have dreamed of wearing blackface to a Purim party (and then saying &#8220;I would do it again&#8221;). I am pretty sure he had no idea and still doesn&#8217;t really get it. Whose fault is that? Partially his for not breaking out of his insular bubble, but in the end he is just a victim of his society that doesn&#8217;t really get it when it comes to minorities in general and black people in particular. In a community where no one bats an eyelash at racial slurs like the N word or the Yiddish slightly less offensive version, how in the world are we to expect any sensitivity toward racially inappropriate behavior?</p>
<p>Now I am not excusing R&#8217; Friedman or Hikind for their deplorable actions. Ignorance is not bliss. I am saying that we as a community need to be more aware of what the rest of the world thinks. We need to realize that we are part of a global community now and we are going to be noticed. There is outside information that can help us and we should attempt to assimilate that information into our social structure. It&#8217;s not more frum to think that the Torah can cure sex abuse and it&#8217;s not more frum to say or do things that could be considered racist. It&#8217;s time to move on and learn from our advanced understanding of psychology and our politically sensitive society.</p>
<p>The same goes for how women are thought of and treated in the frum community. We are way behind the rest of the world in our approach to women. Is it really frum or necessary to keep those ancient notions that are rooted in social conventions and commonly held beliefs? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>We must hold tightly to what the Torah says and what Chazal require from us, but we must also integrate new knowledge and understanding that increases our sensitivity to others and our place in an international, cosmopolitan community. In this way, we can combine the best of what Torah offers with the best of what a global, sensitive society can offer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6707" alt="513723" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/513723-261x300.jpg" width="261" height="300" /></a>I planned this post for a little while, and it dovetails perfectly in the wake of yesterday&#8217;s post about the Op-Ed by Rabbi Sacks (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/25/a-small-addition-to-rabbi-sacks-beautiful-article-in-the-ny-times/">A Small Addition to Rabbi Sacks’ Beautiful Article in the NY Times</a>).</em></p>
<p>The best book I read this year was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists: A Non-believer&#8217;s Guide to the Uses of Religion</a> by Alain de Botton. The author is a Jewish atheist and apparently a direct descendant of the author of the Lechem Mishnah commentary on Maimonides&#8217; Mishnah Torah. The book is excellent and I highly recommend that everyone read it.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the book is written for atheists. I think believers should read this book at least as much as atheists should read it. The book tries to show that there is a lot that atheists can learn from religion. Generally speaking, de Botton argues that even if religion is  complete bunk there is a reason it developed, evolved, and flourishes. There are evolutionary needs that religion addresses. Religion serves a very important role in the scheme of man&#8217;s existence and when people abandon religion as atheists, they risk losing the very important evolutionary benefits of religion.</p>
<p>In other words, atheists cannot abandon the principles of religion simply because they disbelieve in God. In fact, it almost makes no sense to do that. An atheist must believe that religion evolved as a response to a human need because the atheists does not believe that religion could possibly be a revelation from God since God does not exist according to the atheist! It follows that according to atheists, religion is a human response to some innate needs and its development and success are vital to the success and progress of humanity. Excising religion from the human experience may be necessary for the atheist, but it is fraught with risks. There are elements of religion that are necessary for human development and without religion, those needs may not be met.<span id="more-6667"></span></p>
<p>So the book then goes on to describe some of the humanistic benefits of various religions. Most of the focus is on Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. I found the references to Judaism very fascinating and enlightening. The author even uses some of the harshest victims of atheistic criticism as examples of worthy ideas that should be emulated. For example, he uses mikvah, (yes mikvah!), as an example of attaching ritual and meaning to washing. He says that there is something valuable in attaching bathing to renewal and associating outer washing with inner purity. As orthodox Jews, we may scoff at this humanistic approach to mikvah and it may not be sufficient to allay some of the discomfort that some orthodox Jewish women have with mikvah, but it is refreshing to see a non-believer try to find beauty and meaning in this practice.</p>
<p>Another great example in the book is his section on forgiveness. Yom Kippur is an ingenious way of reconnecting people. It is a day where we are forced to reconcile with our past. Non-believers need such a day as well.</p>
<p>Most importantly, religion creates community and responsibility toward one another. The book mentions Jewish weddings and Bar Mitzvah celebrations as important rituals within a community that should be emulated by non-believers.</p>
<p>The follow up point to each example is that atheists must create analogous practices and rituals for their lives in order to satisfy their needs that are not being met by the absence of religion in their lives. The book proposes cathedrals for atheists, yearly celebrations of bounty, and other corollaries to religious practices for atheists. The proposals are fantastic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mostly theoretical book because I don&#8217;t see how any of this would every come into being. But if it would happen, I think it would be great for society.</p>
<p>Although the book is written for atheists, I think there is something important here for believers as well. We need to appreciate the depth and beauty of our religious practices. We need to see how to a non-believer many of our practices are useful even if God did not exist. To us, who believe God does exist, the benefits of religion are even greater. We need to appreciate how incredibly useful our religion is to our psyche and wellbeing and we need to thank God for giving us such a wonderful way of life to satisfy those needs. This is the true value of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> to the believer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not recommending orthopraxy. I am suggesting that the believer take into account all that religion does for the believer in a religious but also in a secular, psychological, and evolutionary way. We need to realize that what we are doing was given to us by God and it goes beyond just ritual or Divine command that has no non-religious benefit. We should acknowledge and explore the potential humanistic reasons for practicing orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The book also can serve as a bit of a bridge between atheists and believers. It gives us common ground and serves as an antidote to the Dawkins inspired derision of religion. I&#8217;d pay a lot of money to see a debate between Dawkins and de Botton. I also wish the Chief Rabbi would have read this book and incorporated some of its lessons in his Op-Ed earlier this week.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> enough. It is a great book for believers and non-believers alike.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6654" alt="270209_reachingout" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/270209_reachingout-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" />We&#8217;ve covered Klal Perspectives here before. I think we will follow the same format as we did last time. I am going to highlight the one good article that I read in the journal in this post. Hopefully next week I will write my response to the Questions in this Klal Perspectives issue.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Klal Perspectives, here is the intro from my post on the previous issue:</p>
<p><em>Klal Perspectives is a great journal of articles written by orthodox Jewish rabbis and writers. The difference between Klal Perspectives and other journals is basically the content. KP is not a halacha journal. It is a practical journal.</em></p>
<p><em>The articles are not about well researched, fine nuances of Jewish law. The articles are about the issues that the orthodox community is facing and how to deal with them. Because the articles are not academic, they appeal to more people and more people are capable of writing articles for the journal. In a pleasing development, several articles have been authored by women. Lay-people are also featured as writers.</em></p>
<p>The issue being handled in this issue is Kiruv. The questions are pretty specific but the goal is to discuss <em>&#8220;varying approaches to outreach currently being pursued, and the appropriateness of the current allocation of communal resources as among these alternative strategies and focuses.&#8221;<span id="more-6653"></span></em></p>
<p>The journal does not agree upon a definition for the word Kiruv but I think they generally define it as bringing non-orthodox Jews to mitzvah observance.</p>
<p>Honestly, the responses that I read were pretty depressing. The articles did not really answer the questions that they were asked to answer. This is somewhat typical of Kiruv in general, as the entire field is not really very into using data and statistics. There were barely any footnotes in the articles I read. To me, this means that the writers are writing from their hearts and minds, but not from a place of hard data. That&#8217;s fine, but it is qualitatively different than well researched writing. Most of the articles I read sounded more like sermons, or divrei Torah than journal articles. That&#8217;s also fine, but I think that reflects poorly on the Kiruv field. Yet, it rings true to my ears, in the sense that the Kiruv profession, for better or worse, is not really about data, numbers, efficiency of resources, or other more modern metrics.</p>
<p>None of the articles I read actually discussed the issues of proving God&#8217;s existence or the veracity of the Torah. One article acknowledged the challenges of Biblical Criticism, but said nothing about how to meet the challenge. It&#8217;s almost as if the Kiruv professionals who wrote articles are not aware that belief in God and Torah from Sinai is not as easy as it sounds. Perhaps, the reason Kiruv seems to be floundering is because we can&#8217;t get past first base!</p>
<p>One article stood out. Rabbi Ilan Feldman wrote more about the orthodox Jewish community than about Kiruv per se, but his observations are right on the money.</p>
<p>His basic point is that the success of orthodox Judaism actually harms Kiruv. Our communities are large, intimidating, and have become focused on observance above being what he calls &#8220;model communities&#8221;. We are more careful about chumros and precision in halacha and hashkafa that it detracts from our appeal. Further, our success permits untrue stereotypes about our non-orthodox comrades to develop and reach levels of acceptance that they are considered normal.</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman relates a powerful story about the time he joined a mission of Federation style Jews (read = non-orthodox) as a way of trying to build a bridge between the respective communities. Throughout the trip he had to make many sacrifices and concessions all while not getting offended by the ignorance of orthodox Judaism exhibited throughout the trip. By the end of the trip his trip-mates warmed up to him and they had great conversations while getting to know each other pretty well. He felt that he was successful in dispelling many of the unfair or erroneous assumptions about orthodox Judaism by going on the trip.</p>
<p>This is not an unfamiliar script. It happens all the time. But the part that hit home for me, and elicited a tear in the corner of my eye was this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But the one who was most transformed on that trip was me.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What I expected to encounter was a group of 200 Jews devoid of feelings for Israel or religion. What I discovered instead were 200 very religious, spiritual, passionately devoted, proud Jews who knew very little about Torah and who lacked a Jewish vocabulary, but who loved their Jewish brethren in Israel, respected holiness and possessed a passion for Judaism as they knew it that rivaled the passion I had seen in my frum friends. In short, I learned to respect them. And I learned that “secular” Jews are often very religious Jews who do not know ritual, and whose devotion and willingness to sacrifice for the Judaism they do know is inspiring. By the time we parted ways, I actually loved them. Once I made this discovery, I was both surprised and embarrassed that it was new to me.</em></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is so true. In some orthodox circles, the non-orthodox are heathen, God hating, anti-Semites. This is a lie. Maybe part of why Kiruv has become so hard is because they know what we think of them&#8230;</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman then returns to the point about our communities focusing more on observance than being models. When combined with our arrogance about our own observance our ignorance about non-orthodox Jews creates this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Picture an emotionally and financially secure, successful, well-educated head of household who lives in a world in which wisdom is respected, volunteering over the weekend is considered a wonderful way to spend one’s time, wholesome family activities on Saturday afternoon are seen as a healthy way of building character. Ask him to join a world in which routine Shabbos-table talk argues in favor of Torah by disparaging secular wisdom, in which political candidates are assessed purely on selfish concerns of the religious community, with little concern for their impact on broader society. Not only is this sort of talk distinctly unattractive, it is not the talk of giants; it obscures the sense of responsibility, compassion and awe for G-d’s children that Avraham Avinu left as his legacy to his descendants.</em></p>
<p>Again. Wow.</p>
<p>But it is true. Orthodox Jews are led to believe that non-orthodox Jews and non-Jews are flailing about in the God-forsaken secular world. They are up the creek without a paddle. If only they would see the beauty of orthodox Judaism, they would be like thirsty camels drinking from the cool waters of our oasis of Torah. But that&#8217;s not the way it is. People are doing just fine without religion, and we are not always doing just fine with religion. We need to change how we view them and more importantly we need to change ourselves.</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman offers a hopeful alternative vision.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Orthodox Jews would be sufficiently secure with their own Yiddishkeit to invite their neighbors and co-workers to their homes, because the language of fear will have been replaced by a language of connection and confidence. Orthodox Jews would lead lives of idealism that extend beyond their own religious needs, inevitably becoming role models and attractive examples of lifestyle to non-observant Jews. Families will make life decisions informed by the religious needs of Klal Yisrael, not exclusively their own. Young couples will be recognized as an invaluable resource in a battle for the spiritual lives of all Jews, and will be encouraged to choose where to reside based upon where their presence would most greatly enhance Judaism, rather than merely their own religious comforts.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Because Orthodoxy would authentically and profoundly respect people, Orthodox community leaders would develop a reputation for selfless devotion to the good of the broader community, rather than solely parochial interests. For example, communal leadership will be invested in ensuring strong public schools in their neighborhoods, even though their own constituencies attend only yeshivas.</em></p>
<p>Notice the subtle criticism of the orthodox establishment? I honestly think this criticism is spot on. But there is hope. In Rabbi Feldman&#8217;s opinion, with the proper attitudes in place, we become a more attractive destination for passionate Judaism among the non-orthodox. I agree. This is what it would look like:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Non-observant Jews will be welcomed by their frum neighbors in both large frum communities as well as in evolving frum neighborhoods, and frum Jews will be more than welcome into their neighborhoods by the non-Orthodox, eruv and all, because Orthodox people would be known to be ideal neighbors: friendly, non-judgmental, and interested in the needs of others.</em></p>
<p>We can dream, right?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Shema_Yisrael.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6497" title="Shema_Yisrael" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Shema_Yisrael-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>A little background: Someone I know, and respect, was watching a documentary online about something Jewish history related. One of the people interviewed in the documentary was Professor Lawrence Schiffman. Some time later, this fellow mentioned something about &#8220;the conservative rabbi in the documentary&#8221;. I did not understand who he was talking about. Eventually we figured out that he was talking about Prof. Schiffman. Incredulous, I told this person that Prof. Schiffman is a very orthodox Jew and certainly not a conservative rabbi!</p>
<p>But I think I can understand why a run of the mill orthodox Jew would consider Prof. Schiffman conservative. It is on display in his recent, <a href="http://lawrenceschiffman.com/the-lord-is-one-reflections-on-the-history-of-judaism-in-light-of-the-shema-text-from-halbturn-austria/" target="_blank">magnificent blog post about an 1800 year old Golden Shema plate from Austria</a>. The article is really incredible in its scope and implication and I highly recommend reading it for several reasons.</p>
<p>The point I wish to focus our attention is the overall theme that Judaism has evolved, but not just from the time of the Mishna to now, it evolved from the time of entering the Land of Israel with Joshua to the time of the Mishna. Primarily, Prof. Schiffman suggests that monotheism in Judaism changed from a fuzzy version of One God with multiple Deity like figures to a more modern version of Monotheism where there is One God and no other power.</p>
<p>Things like magical spells are permissible using this original form of fuzzy monotheism, if done in the right way. Once the rabbis of the mishna modernized and canonized monotheism in a more rigid manner, &#8220;white&#8221; magic would be prohibited.<span id="more-6496"></span></p>
<p>To me, this also explains how in the origins of Christianity a Trinity was not so completely at odds with Judaism. There was an ancient Jewish tradition of fuzzy monotheism to draw from. The immediate reaction was to counter with rigid monotheism and then later on, the Mystics, according to Chacham Faur, reinvigorated some of the fuzzy monotheistic flavor back into Judaism.</p>
<p>But the overarching theme here is that things do change and Judaism does respond to social, political, and religious conditions. Whether is a conscious move or a subconcsious drift, Judaism is not a monolith and it never really has been.</p>
<p>As Prof. Schiffman concludes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This is Judaism as a historical phenomenon in ancient times.  To deny this diversity and to use the term “Judaisms” is also to deny its continuity and commonality and, hence, to deny its essence.  To deny its variegation is to turn it into a cult, in the modern sense of the term. To deny its often fuzzy boundaries is to deny its identity.</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But to state this today is to contradict the contemporary orthodox Jewish narrative. Saying these things implies something other than orthodox Judaism. It can lead an objective, honest, 2012 orthodox Jew to think that this is objectionable and only that for some reason only makes sense in the paradigm of conservative Judaism. That is a shame. Let us hope that we can broaden the spectrum just enough to be more honest about the evolution of Judaism. Let us try to ensure that there is a place, if not a primary one, for acknowledging Judaism&#8217;s capacity to change and at the same time be inclusive of many different shapes and forms even within orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/family.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6377" title="family" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/family-300x208.gif" alt="" width="300" height="208" /></a>A bunch of people sent this video my way. They all suggested I watch the video and they all felt the video was very powerful. I needed to find 30 minutes to watch it. This morning I had an opportunity to watch it and I must say that I wholeheartedly agree with them.</p>
<p>The video is a student project (read: not very professionally produced) but sometimes simplicity is the most pure form of art. It is a documentary that tells the story of three daughters, maybe three and a half daughters, of prominent religious Zionist rabbis in Israel. I am not familiar with too many religious Zionist rabbis but I have heard of all three of these rabbis.</p>
<p>Each of the daughters is no longer as observant as her family. The film explores that tension in a very real way.<span id="more-6375"></span></p>
<p>In my opinion, the film is not about rabbis and daughter. Only one of the daughters seems to have been particularly affected by the fact that her father was a prominent rabbi. The other two could have just as easily been daughters of any orthodox family.</p>
<p>I trust you&#8217;ll watch the video when you have the time and I am sure you will have your own reactions.</p>
<p>Here are some of my thoughts on the video.</p>
<p>The fathers come off really well. I am sure it was not always so pleasant growing up as a rebellious daughter of a prominent rabbi. Yet they are portrayed at loving, down to earth, and genuinely concerned about their daughters. Especially Rav Aviner.</p>
<p>The daughters all seem really artistic, artsy even. I think this is a very important point. Of all the personality types that might not be compatible with orthodox Judaism, I think the artsy type could be the most difficult. Artsy types, and I know this is a generalization, value and crave independence. Freedom of expression and thought is a large part of what makes people artistic. Conforming to orthodox Judaism is hard for artsy types if they are born into it. A lot of Baalei Teshuva are artsy for the opposite reason. They left their homes and expressed themselves via orthodox Judaism. But I think it is still fair to say that the artistic Baalei Teshuva are non-conformist orthodox Jews. I think that is great. But we need to find more opportunities for artsy types who are born into orthodox Judaism, especially for young women.</p>
<p>Thinking about this from a rabbinic perspective was interesting. First of all, I am the son of a rabbi. My experience actually somewhat mirrored the one daughter (Bigman) whose experience was rabbi-centric. She was &#8220;more orthodox&#8221; than her peers as a child. I had a similar experience. My father was the principal of a modern orthodox school and we had higher religious standards than almost all of my friends. It was not easy for me either. Going to high school at Ner Israel almost turned that upside down as many of my peers had more religious homes than mine. Perhaps they balanced each other out. But I was able to relate to her struggle very much.</p>
<p>I am also the father of two sons of a rabbi. I know that it can sometimes be challenging for them to be the son of a rabbi. But in this respect, I don&#8217;t see their experience mirroring that of the daughters all that much at this point. I am not a super famous rabbi who is called away from his family too often. I feel more like a regular dad who happens to be a rabbi. But the video certainly illustrated the fears that I have in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>I am sure that some people will watch this video and attribute the issues these daughters have to their more open religious Zionist lifestyle. They will blame this philosophy for these rabbis&#8217; daughters leaving orthodox Judaism. This is burying one&#8217;s head deep into the sand. Amongst every kind of orthodox Judaism there are people who leave. There are daughters of every single kind of rabbi out there who have left orthodox Judaism. It is not a new phenomena either. It is a part of our heritage and history. I really hope that people don&#8217;t come away from this video and see it is a justification for living any other form of Judaism as a protection against this.</p>
<p>The most important thing about this video to me, is that it raises the issue of how to deal with children who are not following our personal choices. It can be extremely challenging for a parent when a child reject their way of life. Sometimes rejection is absolute. The parents are orthodox and the child is secular. Sometimes it is far less absolute. The parents are chasidic or very yeshivish and the child is modern. Or the parents are modern and the children are ultra-orthodox. These can sometimes be very challenging situations as well.</p>
<p>I think that it is very important that the parent / child relationship not depend on religious observance. It is hurtful to parents when children diverge from their parents&#8217; way of life. But that pain cannot be more prominent than the love of a parent for a child and a child for a parent.</p>
<p>Every child needs to feel accepted by their parents. Every child needs to know that they are loved for who they are even if they are doing things which parents do not approve.</p>
<p>In so many of our prayers and remarks around the High Holidays we note that despite our failings God loves us unconditionally. We need to be able to follow the lead of God on this one. If God can do it, we need to at least try.</p>
<p>Not everyone works the same way and not everyone can be exactly the same. We need to find a place in our communities and even in our families for different forms of expression. Sometimes those forms of expression may be in accordance with halacha, and sometimes they might be at odds with halacha. While the orthodox community cannot condone the breaking of halacha, we must understand that it simply does not work for everyone. If we want to have relationships with our friends and family who are not as comfortable in the box, we need to let them know that they can still be loved and accepted despite our religious differences.</p>
<p>Everyone yearns for acceptance. Clearly, in our homes we should not make acceptance dependent on religious practice. But even in our communities we should not make acceptance dependent on religious practice. The Jewish people are a family. We have all types and that&#8217;s just fine with us.</p>

<p>By now you&#8217;ve probably heard that Anat Hoffman was arrested at the Western Wall last week. You may have read her personal account that describes a harrowing encounter with law enforcement. I don&#8217;t know if her claims are true or exaggerated, but her claims are irrelevant. Nor does it matter what sensationalist headlines have been penned.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post we will focus exclusively on facts and then my opinion based on those facts. Here are the facts:</p>
<p>Women of the Wall is an organization whose &#8220;mission is to achieve the social and legal recognition of our right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray, and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those facts are undisputed. They are agitators. They are trying to change the status quo. They are activists.<span id="more-6360"></span></p>
<p>Anat Hoffman is their leader and her mission is to agitate, change the status quo. She is the chief activist.</p>
<p>The Women of the Wall write on their website that the law at the Western Wall is that no religious ceremony may be performed in the Women&#8217;s section of the Western Wall plaza. Although this is not a primary source, and I cannot find the primary source (feel free to fill me in), we will consider this a fact as well. The law has been interpreted to ban women from blowing a shofar or wearing a prayer shawl and from reading the Torah out loud.</p>
<p>Anat Hoffman leads a women&#8217;s prayer group at the Western Wall from time to time. She wears a prayer shawl and reads from the Torah. On several occasions Ms. Hoffman has been asked or demanded to cease these illegal activities. She does not acquiesce. She gets arrested.</p>
<p>This has happened several times. Each time it happens the media gets excited about it, Women of the Wall gets publicity, and&#8230; nothing changes.</p>
<p>Supporters of WOW find the law offensive and the subsequent arrests and treatment subversive.</p>
<p>Traditionalists consider Hoffman a disingenuous troublemaker who deserves what she gets.</p>
<p>Here is where the facts end and my opinion begins.</p>
<p>The law prohibiting women from religious ceremony at the Western Wall is a law that is written by orthodox rabbis to preserve the sanctity of their holiest place.They honestly believe that a woman who blows a shofar, or wears a prayer shawl, or reads from the Torah is an affront to God and the Holiness of the Western Wall. My question for them is why?</p>
<p>There is no prohibition against a woman doing any of these mitzvos. In fact, R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein writes that women are welcome to do these mitzvahs. There is nothing wrong with a woman reading from a Torah scroll for other women. Nothing at all. To be clear, the law is prohibiting actions that are permissible according to halacha. I find this hard to stomach.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s grant the rabbis of the Western Wall the power to legislate the decorum of the Western Wall. While this may be offensive to non-orthodox Jews, I can also understand why they have control over the Wall. But the rabbis of the Wall are only granted the right to legislate the Wall in accordance with Jewish law! So it is reasonable that they would prohibit men and women from praying together. It is also reasonable that they would mandate reasonably modest dress at the Wall. But it is not reasonable to enforce a rule that prevents people from performing mitzvahs that they are granted permission to perform!</p>
<p>It is hard to condone the law as it currently stands.</p>
<p>Some people have a hard time giving credence to an agitator like Anat Hoffman. While it may be challenging for Traditionalists to support her cause, the broader message of her cause is universal. All people should be granted the right to serve God at the Western Wall so long as it does not violate halacha. It seems hard to oppose that kind of rule.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really feel bad for Ms. Hoffman. She knows what is coming to her when she agitates the establishment. But just because she knows what is coming to her, that does not mean that her battle is not my battle. I empathize with Ms. Hoffman and I support her right to worship God at her holiest of places so long as she conforms to halacha. She has. Getting arrested for following halacha and doing a mitzvah at the Western Wall should not be the norm. This is a form of religious persecution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only the more liberal branches of Judaism have publically supported Ms. Hoffman.</p>
<p>This is the least effective way to change the established rules. Hopefully, the powers that be at the Western Wall will see the beauty and value in allowing women to pray in accordance with halacha even if it is not in accordance with their personal preferences and standards.</p>

Fraenkel is a philosopher and the various philosophies of different groups intrigues him. The basic premise of his efforts is that most people are religious or secular based on things that are completely out of their control. Where one is born, to whom one is born, when one is born, are the most relevant factors in determining beliefs.</p>
<p>Fraenkel paraphrases the great Muslim philosopher who questioned his beliefs when he realized he would have been a fervent Jew or Christian had he been born to a Jewish or Christian family.</p>
<p>I will never forget when <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/09/rabbi-yosef-tendler-of-blessed-memory/" target="_blank">Rabbi Tendler</a> told me that he had the same question. It&#8217;s a bit of an epiphany when one realizes that this is likely the truth. But this question is not the focus of Fraenkel&#8217;s article or this blog post.<span id="more-6223"></span></p>
<p>Fraenkel proposes that we create a culture of debate. People from all backgrounds would discuss their ideas and hopefully arrive at some level of truth. He disingenuously invokes the debates of the middle ages as support. I say disingenuously, because those debates often had fatal consequences for the loser. Be that as it may, Fraenkel&#8217;s proposal is to teach debate and philosophy as a way of increasing mutual tolerance between believers of different faiths and non-believers.</p>
<p>I think he is sincere and I agree with his theory about tolerance. Although, I must forewarn that I am pretty sure that without incredible sensitivity, these debates will result in less tolerance and less adherence to one&#8217;s faith. It is very difficult to have religious debate without it turning personal or offensive. Further, most people are not well versed enough in their religions to carry an honest debate. If he think he can pull it off, more power to him. But I think increased debate will undoubtably lead to less fervent belief. The group with superior debaters will surely influence the others. Meaning, the personality and skill of the debater can outshine the substance of the arguments.</p>
<p>But Fraenkel&#8217;s overall point is very worthy. His idea is to slow the melting pot and create a multi-cultural society where people have strong religious or ethnic identities but live together in harmony. This is a very noble idea and I share this dream. The problem is that when people live in less homogenous environments their strong beliefs are bound to be weakened. Insularity is harmful for many things, but it is helpful for reinforcing beliefs. So while I dream of the same kind of society as Fraenkel, I am skeptical that this dream can become a reality.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend the NY Times article.</p>
<p>On Jewish Ideas Daily, Fraenkel writes a follow up to his NY Times article where he discusses his work with some chasidic Jews. I think only one or two of them are Satmar and the others are Chabad. As you should know by now, Chabad is different than the other Chasidic groups in many ways (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/04/29/book-review-unchosen/">Book Review | Unchosen</a>) and I think that the differences play a role in their involvement here. But we are going to pretend that all chasidic groups are the same for the sake of this post.</p>
<p>The article is long and sometimes boring, but worth reading in its entirety. The basic idea is that some chasids have a philosophy study group with Fraenkel and this has contributed to their disenfranchisement with their community. This is a really cool idea and I think it is great to learn philosophy, especially with an expert like Fraenkel. The article is also full of excellent observations on insular chasidic life. Many of the observations are equally valid in non-chasidic orthodox environments as well. (Those were my favorite parts of the article).</p>
<p>The problem that I have with this little study group is that they reinforce the stereotype that orthodox Judaism is not up to the challenge of philosophy. The article implies in more than one place that these fellows are the new enlightened orthodox Jews and they now know that orthodox Judaism is incompatible with modern thinking.</p>
<p>However, this is not true. The reason this group feels that way is because they were disenfranchised before they began studying philosophy. They had already left orthodox Judaism in their hearts and minds before they began to study with Fraenkel. I would hardly expect them to survive an in depth analysis of philosophy once their collective bubbles had been burst.</p>
<p>I wish Fraenkel would find a study group of committed orthodox Jews. That would be more interesting to me and more useful overall. As it is now, he is dealing with people who want to leave but are stuck. Not exactly a case study in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Learning philosophy and engaging in debate in the more formative years of yeshiva learning could be very beneficial. It was considered beneficial to the medieval Jewish commentators. We could learn a think or two from them. But in the end, philosophy in Judaism is periphery. It is not the reasons we do anything and it is mostly conjecture as God has not handed us a book of philosophy. But working things out in one&#8217;s mind and challenging each other to understand the questions and answers of our religion is a good thing. It was good 1000 years ago. It should be good now as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll close with an invitation to Professor Fraenkel: Come to LA and study with some committed orthodox Jews who are part of less insular communities. I think the results would be extremely fascinating.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Man_walking_away_pe0058192.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6204" title="Man_walking_away_pe0058192" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Man_walking_away_pe0058192-300x203.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="203" /></a>This is a great essay. It&#8217;s not great because I enjoy the story or because I am proud of its writer. It is a great essay because it is a window into the fragile state of orthodox Jewish teens.</p>
<p>I think this specific type of problem is more prevalent in modern orthodox day schools than in the more right wing yeshivas. The yeshivas have their own set of problems and issues they need to deal with. But in the modern orthodox schools, I think this kind of story is more common.</p>
<p>In short, this young man talks about his love affair with his tefillin. He recalls the surge of emotion and pride as he wore those tefillin for the first few years after his Bar Mitzvah. Then he began to question everything and finding no sufficient answers (apparently) he has decided to leave orthodox Judaism. He does it all with a great analogy to Toy Story.<span id="more-6201"></span></p>
<p>I think the tefillin are a metaphor for the entirety of orthodox Jewish life. Accepting that assumption, I think we can also safely assume that this kid was a great student and proud orthodox Jew. His love for orthodox observance in his early teens gave way to indifference in his later teen years.</p>
<p>The writer makes the claim that his faith was shaken by the lack of satisfactory answers to legitimate questions. This is a real issue for teens and for adults. I believe it is the biggest challenge that the orthodox Jewish community is facing today. I don&#8217;t claim to have a solution to the problem. But I think the most basic first step to a solution is rooted in dialogue about these issues. If we don&#8217;t have that conversation we have no chance of keeping inquisitive teens in the fold.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the article is the end. Even the writer acknowledges that he has not left permanently. This is a stage of life that he is going through and no one can predict what the next stage will bring. I think that is a great attitude. It&#8217;s a great attitude for the young man but it is an important attitude for us that staunchly remain in the fold too.</p>
<p>We need to recognize that some people will go on their own path to discovery and while we can&#8217;t condone behavior that is incompatible with halacha, we can be patient. We can be supportive. We can still love our friends and family who may be going through this kind of internal upheaval. I think that is the most effective ingredient for providing a safe haven for these people to return should they choose to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to keep a place in our communities open and available to those on the fence or on the other side of the fence. We cannot allow them to feel like pariahs or like they are unstable or unwell. We cannot let them feel like they are being judged or cast off. They need our support and friendship at least as much as our halachically observant friends and family. But I don&#8217;t mean that we should be nice to them out of pity or out of a hope that our friendship will bring them back. I mean that we should be friendly to them in the same way we would want to be treated by others. Treating them like they are pathetic or needy is not very helpful. Treating them just like we always treated them is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I wish this young man much success and I hope he can find his way back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/url.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5781" title="why" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/url-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>In less than four years, this blog has grown from a minor blip on the radar (I got 6500 hits in the first six months) to a substantial, engaging community of interested and interesting people (I get 6500 hits a day sometimes). Reflecting on my time as a blogger, I can see how my voice has changed, adjusted, and adapted to meet varying needs and wants as well as my (somewhat fluid) views on Torah and orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>If you look back at the articles from 2008 and 2009 you&#8217;ll see that they are a bit different than the articles I write these days. Not significantly different, just different enough to notice. But as I grew in my rabbinic position at Pacific Jewish Center, and journeyed through law school, and learned more Torah, and accumulated more experiences I found a voice. But this voice was not just my own voice. It was the voice of many Jews from every single kind of background that I have come in contact with through the last few years. (Similarly, many people are comfortable in my shul, while they are not comfortable in other orthodox shuls.) I am not saying I speak for everyone or even most people. Rather, there are enough people who find their own voice coming through the words when they read this blog.</p>
<p>It was never my intention to create controversy. It was never my intention to bash or insult large swaths of people. That may happen from time to time but that&#8217;s not the goal. In fact, I would rather do without it.</p>
<p><span id="more-5772"></span></p>
<p>Yet, I do find myself the target of criticism, usually from the charedi side of things, but often enough from the more liberal communities of orthodox and non-orthodox Jews. As a committed orthodox Jew, I recognize that I am easy pickings for more liberal Jews. But the criticism from the charedi side is more significant and has a greater impact on my reputation and career. I would therefore like to clarify and explain a few things to set the record straight.</p>
<p>My goal with this blog is to increase <em>kavod shamayim</em><em> </em>and <em>kiddush Hashem</em>. My goal is to nudge orthodox Judaism just enough to be more inclusive, more welcoming, and more attractive, to non-orthodox <em>and</em> to orthodox Jews. My goal is to inspire positive change that is permissible within the context of halacha. My goal is to facilitate conversations about the issues that are important to orthodox Jews and to everyone else. My goal is to increase communication between all people. My goal is to inspire people to find their voice within orthodox Judaism. My goal is to provide<strong> positive Jewish experiences</strong> to as many people as I possibly can.</p>
<p>Sometimes this means talking frankly and candidly about flaws in our communities. Sometimes that means challenging our leadership. Sometimes that means asking questions that deserve good answers. Sometimes that means finding ourselves in strange alliances with people who seem so far from our beliefs. Sometimes it means disagreeing with people far greater than me in Torah and with much more life experience than me. Sometimes it means making mistakes.</p>
<p>Am I a troublemaker? Should I be banned or excommunicated?</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>The style of orthodox Judaism that I try to endorse and promote is a similar style to that of my rebbeim, my grandfathers and my father. My rebbeim never told me not to ask question and challenge. I was taught to respect the words of great rabbis and I do. But respect does not mean blind adherence. Sometimes it means challenging. After all, if their words are to be revered and respected, their words should be scrutinized as well. And if the forum was a newspaper or magazine 50 years ago, the forum today is the Internet. I apologize if people think the Internet is a <em>moshav leitzim</em> and a place where it is impossible to have a serious conversation. I think that has been disproved a million times over.</p>
<p>My family tradition has always been to be activists and involved in community growth. My grandfathers were engaged in the secular world, formally educated, and also great Torah scholars and influencers in the broad orthodox Jewish community. The Internet is a natural place for this kind of work to take place in 2012. I get emails, messages, calls, texts, comments, and snail mail, acknowledging and thanking me for this blog. The correspondence comes from every type of Jew and from all over the world. The Internet makes this possible. This blog is a community and it is new kind of community that didn&#8217;t exist 15 years ago. That doesn&#8217;t make it wrong.</p>
<p>My hope is that by creating this space for important conversations we can all make our claim in the future of orthodox Judaism. We all have a stake in it. We all can have our voice in it.</p>
<p>There is a method to the madness. I try my best to invite good discussion whether it is on the blog comments, on Facebook (there&#8217;s almost always an equal, if not better, comment thread over there), the coffee rooms, or at your Shabbos table. I try very hard not to cross the line of impropriety. Reasonable people may disagree over where that line is. But I do have a line and I do try to stay on one side of that line. (The safe side.) I welcome criticism and suggestions. Those of you who have reached out to me know that I respond to your positive emails and your negative emails.</p>
<p>I think orthodox Judaism is great. We have stories of unbelievable heroism and leadership in our communities. Many people are living beautiful orthodox Jewish lives. There are books that have been written about these people and their stories. I don&#8217;t think I need to reiterate how much goodness exists in our communities but I will do it anyway. Go to any orthodox Jewish community. You will find open homes, open hearts, and disproportionate virtue and charity. We are getting some things right and when we are doing well it means we are doing incredibly well. We can sit back and enjoy how awesome we are or we can try and tweak the things that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>My point is that I am not trying to destroy anything. The things that it may seem like I am trying to destroy are really just what I believe to be cancers that are destroying us a people. Sometimes chemo is the only solution. Whatever is being attacked, is being attacked with the ultimate goal that the body come out stronger and healthier than it was before the problems were attacked. Sometimes the conversations get a bit heated. Passion should not be confused with disrespect. Passion means that the writer cares. Sometimes I write objectively but other times I write persuasively and it is those times that passion can be misunderstood.</p>
<p>I remain committed to the ideals of passionate orthodox Judaism. I want Judaism to thrive. I want it to grow. I want more people to find joy and satisfaction in orthodox Judaism. These are my goals as a person and a rabbi. These are the same goals that I have for this blog.</p>
<p>Thank you all for making this blog a fun and education place to gather together on the Internet. I hope this post explains at least a little bit about what I trying to do over here. It may seem like it has no rhyme or reason or that I am just trying to push buttons. In fact, there is a rhyme and reason and while I trying to push buttons, the buttons are the ones that I hope will bring improvement and increased vitality to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I hope that if you are a reader of this blog and encounter people who criticize me or the things that are discussed here, this post will be able to quell their fears and reassure them that we are all on the same team. I truly believe in a future where we can all get along and everyone can find their place in orthodox Judaism. I am just trying my best to leave a little space for the out-of-the-box thinkers and non-conformists. We need all types in <em>Klal Yisrael</em>. Let&#8217;s just make sure there is a place for everyone.</p>
<p>Classically, Judaism believes that there is good and evil potential in everyone and everything. Nothing is intrinsically good or evil. The Internet presents us with incredible opportunities and tremendous power. If we are to ignore it and pretend it does not exists we may be wasting a great Heavenly gift. A place on the Internet full of fruitful and thoughtful discussion is a kiddush Hashem. I endeavor to make this blog just such a place. It may not make everyone happy all the time, but I am hopeful that we can agree on mutual goals and ideals and our meeting of the minds in those places allows for the kind of productive discussion on this blog and on many others.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want to be the problem. We just want to be part of the solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/birth-control-pills.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5762" title="birth-control-pills" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/birth-control-pills-300x295.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="189" /></a>A friend of mine and his chavrusa, two Torah scholars, were <a href="http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%2010%20Messner.pdf" target="_blank">published in Hakirah</a> two summers ago. That article discussed the various positions and authorities in Jewish Law regarding ascending the Temple Mount. Their next project was an article on contraception in orthodox Judaism. This article has not yet been published. It is being made available on this blog to benefit the public.</em></p>
<p>A little while back (I can&#8217;t remember when) I mentioned that would be writing a blog post about this subject. I had intended to do a little summary of this article and add my own two cents. Now you get the full article and maybe only 1 cent from me.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my one cent. Contraception is a huge issue in the orthodox Jewish community. In general, its use is managed by the rabbis. Couples are discouraged from using birth control in general.</p>
<p><span id="more-5759"></span></p>
<p>In some more liberal communities within the yeshivish community, newly married couples are being granted a few months of contraception use. This is because there has been a spate of quick divorces in the community so they are encouraged to use birth control just to make sure they aren&#8217;t stuck with a baby on the way and a crumbling marriage.</p>
<p>Once the couple is comfortably married, they are expected to have a large family. Birth control is usually permitted for at least a year after a baby is born. That&#8217;s it. More than that requires asking the rabbi. The rabbis usually give a few months. Then the couple asks again and they get a few weeks. They ask again, the rabbi tries to convince them it is time to have another baby. At this point the couple has four options. 1) Listen to the rabbi. 2) Ignore the rabbi and risk lose respect for rabbinic guidance. 3) Explain to the rabbi why it is impossible to have another baby because of financial pressures (he will say Hashem will help), or because there is too much stress from motherhood (he will say to get domestic help), or because of the mother&#8217;s emotional or physical health (that might do the trick) and hopefully the rabbi will grant a longer reprieve. 4) Lie about the things mentioned in 3.</p>
<p>I hear things. People tell me things. I get emails. I get phone calls. It seems the most popular option these days are #1 and #4. Some people just listen. They have large families and even if some don&#8217;t really want large families, they do it and just chalk it up to the price of being a <em>Frum Yid</em>. But many others end up lying or stretching the truth just so the rabbi will let them use birth control.</p>
<p>Sometimes the rabbis even want to talk to the wives and they try to show them that having children is so important and some have even said that it is more important than their relationships with their husbands.</p>
<p>I have heard these things from men and women, first hand. Some are disappointed, most feel discouraged, and all are upset.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a problem here.</p>
<p>To what extent should couples be able to make their own decision about contraception? To what extent should rabbis be pulling the strings here? What do the sources say about birth control? Is it really a rabbi&#8217;s decision? Is there another way?</p>
<p>Enter this excellent article by Rabbis Mayer and Messner.</p>
<p>I love this article. It goes through the sources very thoroughly and ultimately favors personal decision making and autonomy over blind adherence to authority. In a macro sense, <em>this is how I feel orthodox Judaism works best</em>. Educate yourself on a subject, and make an informed decision that falls within the parameters of halacha on your own. That is the basic premise of the article.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t ruin the article by snatching the punchline. Read the article for yourself. It is worth your time and should be understandable to most people with a basic Torah education.</p>
<p>As a an additional benefit, the writers of the article will be checking in to answer questions and respond to your comments. So please, by all means, maximize this opportunity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/3454935091_Explaination_xlarge.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5750" title="3454935091_Explaination_xlarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/3454935091_Explaination_xlarge-300x236.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="236" /></a>Children are fascinating creatures. All adults started out as children, yet we seem to have no real recollection of what it was like to be a child. Can we really recall what it was like to try things for the first time? Do we remember what it was like to dream of being old enough to make our own decisions? Or to be excluded from conversations because we were not old enough?</p>
<p>I think that intellectually we have those memories in our collective psyche but we can&#8217;t really relate to children.</p>
<p>One of the more difficult roles that adults need to play in the lives of children is &#8220;Answerer of Questions&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are many types of questions and many approaches to answering their questions. Some questions relate to religion, others to society, others are just questions that we cannot answer because we simply don&#8217;t know the answer.</p>
<p>An article in this week&#8217;s NY Times Magazine addresses the concerns of one father as he and his son encounter stereotypes in books and movies. In just 60 years, we as a society have severely adjusted what we consider proper and appropriate depictions of minorities. Yet, some stereotypes persist and are still debated in 2012.<span id="more-5749"></span></p>
<p>The article begins with the child asking why some pirates have a gorilla. The &#8220;gorilla&#8221; is not a gorilla. It is just a very ugly stereotype of an African male.</p>
<p>What do you answer your children when they ask about these ugly stereotypes? Read the article to see what that guy does.</p>
<p>But the article got me thinking about a few things as they relate to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>For starters, I think it is good for us to know that all kids have questions and many parents are placed in the uncomfortable position of answering them. It&#8217;s not just us.</p>
<p>Next, the obvious correlation to orthodox Judaism. In general, we teach our children a very midrashic form of Judaism. We also neglect to mention that there are other interpretations that are valid even within orthodox Judaism. So when our children ask questions and they challenge the wisdom they are being taught, we have ourselves a similar quandary. There are several options. We can defer until they get older. We can change the subject. We can answer the way we would answer an adult. We can reinforce the more fundamentalist view. We have to make the best choice for ourselves and our family.</p>
<p>But the most difficult issues arise when modern sensibilities feel betrayed by commandments in the Torah. I don&#8217;t need to be specific. But there are many instances where a child&#8217;s innocence can cause them to question the Divine Wisdom of God. What are we to say then? How do we explain to our children that God&#8217;s Book has different ideas about what is fair and just than we do?</p>
<p>There are really only three options. 1) We are wrong. God is right. Our minds are perverted by society and when our mind conflicts with God&#8217;s word, we must be wrong. Adjust your thinking accordingly. 2)We are right. God is wrong. Our society is smarter than the Author of this book that claims to be Divine. Toss the Book. 3) The word of God was just at one time. Society has changed and God&#8217;s will can change based on society&#8217;s adjustments.</p>
<p>Option 1 is easy. Fundamentalist Jews use this all the time and with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Option 2 is also easy. It not an acceptable approach in orthodox Judaism. Not one tiny bit.</p>
<p>Option 3 is complicated. Certainly, this is one part of the overall approach of the Reform and Conservative movements. This is not a sufficient reason for it to be wrong in the eyes of orthodox Jews, but it is a warning sign to many. The real question is not who subscribes to this belief, rather, is this belief an acceptable belief in certain circumstances?</p>
<p>Now I am not enough of an expert, by any means, to completely answer this question. However, I do have some preliminary thoughts. First of all, isn&#8217;t this the message of Avraham&#8217;s prayer for the Sedomites? I think it may be.</p>
<p>Further, some parts of Biblical Judaism have already been abrogated, either by the fact that we don&#8217;t have a Temple, or a Sanhedrin, or a Biblical Court. Other parts have been abrogated by the fact that we are not in a position to carry out the word of God. So what do we make of these? Are we to say that God&#8217;s will is that we should really be following these laws but we are <em>anusim</em> in these matters? Or do we say that this is fate? God&#8217;s will is that we should adapt over time and these laws should not be followed in 2012.</p>
<p>There are also cultural and social aspects of contemporary orthodox Judaism that may seem to be part of Judaism but are really just non-essential parts of our lives. Certainly, there are some things that fall into this category that may even be a mitzvah to reject. I will leave this category as a very general comment.</p>
<p>And then there are areas of Jewish law and thought that have not been touched or adjusted at all over time. Or have only been marginally adjusted. Admittedly, I don&#8217;t think any of those are explicitly found in the written Torah. But the Oral Law has generally been treated with the same reverence and reluctance for change. So returning to the original question, is Option 3 acceptable for orthodox Jews?</p>
<p>In some ways yes in other ways no. Is there a pattern or any rhyme or reason to when the answer is yes and when the answer is no? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Most importantly, these questions are not just questions that our children ask, they are questions that we as adults ask. We can&#8217;t be afraid of the questions. We need to be confident in our answers or in our lack of answers. But either way, taking Option 1 or Option 2 ends the conversation. We don&#8217;t want to end the conversation. We want to continue the conversation that&#8217;s been taking place for 3000 years and will take place until the end of days.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CNN-Breaking-News-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5738" title="CNN-Breaking-News-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CNN-Breaking-News-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="180" /></a>It was only a matter of time. The national media has picked up the most important story in the orthodox Jewish community of our day. Nothing compares to this. Not Internet bans or Siyum celebrations or kosher hot dogs. This is THE issue of our time.</p>
<p>CNN does a superficial but somewhat thorough and honest segment on abuse in the chasidic community.</p>
<p>I have embedded the report below. You can watch it, share it, and cry for the victims.</p>
<p>I will just make several bullet points:<span id="more-5737"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The segment is not sensationalist or riddled with half-truths. It is honest and straightforward.</li>
<li>Denial is a powerful drug.</li>
<li>I honestly believe that Hynes is not &#8220;protecting abusers&#8221; for the sake of votes. I think he can&#8217;t prosecute without witnesses and he needs cooperation from victims to prosecute. (I wrote about that here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</li>
<li>One in five being abused is a number that is not scientific but is very possible. One in five thousand would be enough to push us to deal with the issue. One in five is a number that demands immediate and powerful action.</li>
<li>The intimidation of victims and their families should warrant its own segment. Protecting abusers and sacrificing victims is not just heartless and stupid, it compounds the effects of abuse by giving victims the right to think that they are sacrifices and I believe can be linked to victim suicide.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s obviously not just in the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish communities that abuse occurs, but the approach to dealing with abuse is the main difference between the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish community and the rest of the world. We are not equipped to deal with it internally even if we admit that we have a problem. How could we be?</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1828636222-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5735" title="1828636222-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1828636222-1-300x173.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="173" /></a>One blogger at the New York Celebrate Israel Parade was so overwhelmed by the orthodox community&#8217;s involvement at the parade that she declared the future of Judaism in America to be orthodoxy. To be clear, the writer is not orthodox, but the lack of apparent vibrancy from the non-orthodox seemed to swing her vote for orthodoxy as the future of Judaism in America.</p>
<p>I happen to agree. It is extremely difficult to maintain cultural and social Judaism absent ritual and observance of Jewish law. It can be done, but it is becoming more difficult with each passing generation. The proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p>The brand of orthodoxy that will prevail in America is still up for discussion. The writer of that blog post was referring to modern orthodox Judaism seeing as they are the ones she saw at the parade.</p>
<p>Another person at the parade was overwhelmed to a certain degree by the participation of the non-orthodox. This person felt that orthodoxy was not as well represented as they could and should have been. In this person&#8217;s opinion, the parade showcased non-orthodox Jews showing their passion for Israel. The orthodox Jews were like an afterthought. This person is an orthodox Jew.<span id="more-5734"></span></p>
<p>How interesting is it that two different perspectives can yield such different observations?</p>
<p>I believe that we need a combination of the two to maximize the chances of success for American Judaism. And the perfect opportunity to implement this vision is at the parade. Israel is something we all (with the exception of some fringe anti-Israel groups) can agree upon. Israel activism and AIPAC are full of orthodox Jews. Not just modern orthodox Jews. More right wing Jews strongly identify with Israel as well. The JewsNews sites report heavily on Israeli society, politics, and events. Those are sites that are read and written by right leaning (not in the political sense) orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>It seems to me that a parade for Israel is the perfect time to march together in support of a cause and in solidarity with each other. The modern orthodox community has embraced this opportunity and marches in the parade every year. But aside from a few sporadic people from the more yeshivish side of the spectrum, the Agudah / chasidic / Lakewood communities are noticeably absent from the parade.</p>
<p>I understand that there are political concerns. I understand there may be halachic concerns as well. But I just wish we could see past those, if only for one day to stand together and do something as a united Jewish people. I just wish that for once, we could all join in unison and make a clear statement on behalf of something we all agree upon.</p>
<p>In the future of American Judaism, all Jews are able to work together on the things upon which we agree, and there are many such things. The places where we disagree will still be contested. But it will be more like two opinions from the same team as opposed to two opinions from opposing teams.</p>
<p>If we are to get there, I think the New York Celebrate Israel Parade <strong>2013</strong> is a great place to start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/193920.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5728" title="193920" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/193920-233x300.png" alt="" width="233" height="300" /></a>The NFL has decided to give the fans the Holy Grail of NFL Football, the All-22 video.</p>
<p>What is this Holy Grail? It is the film that NFL coaches receive. It is different than broadcast footage because the broadcast only shows a small part of the game. The quarterback is the main focus of the broadcast and the viewer at home does not see what the wide receivers are doing nor do the viewers get a full grasp of how the defense covers the receivers or disguises blitzes. In short, the broadcast footage is very limited in what it allows the viewers at home to see.</p>
<p>ESPN got a very small percentage of All-22 for the NFL Matchup show. But in general, we the public, have never seen enough All-22 to understand the very complex game of the NFL completely.</p>
<p>The All-22 footage gives the viewer a full view of all 22 players on every play. It shows how the schemes look before the play and how the players move through the play. It is the definitive source of all NFL information. It shows everything.</p>
<p><span id="more-5726"></span></p>
<p>For years, the NFL has resisted giving away the All-22 film to the public. Their reasoning was that the public cannot handle the information. They are not initiated in the ways of NFL football like the coaches are and they will misinterpret the information. This will open the players and coaches to unwarranted criticism. Further, the broadcasters do have the All-22 during the game. That&#8217;s how they sound so smart. If people see what the broadcasters see, they will see behind the curtain and realize they are not that smart after all, they just have access to more information.</p>
<p>Now that will all change. We will all be able to see the All-22 footage. The NFL no longer holds the keys to the Ferarri. We all do now.</p>
<p>To me, is representative of a fundamental change in the way we approach information in 2012. Knowledge, wisdom, and information are expected to be accessible to all. They are expected to be available to anyone who wants it. This is the generation of Wikipedia. This is the generation of Google. This is the generation of free information.</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica was a giant leap in making information accessible to many people. But they still needed to shell out a ton of cash to buy a full set or they could mosey on to the library and read it there. But it was not easy accessible to anyone and everyone. That&#8217;s the old model. Wikipedia is the new model. Free information.</p>
<p>The NFL has caught wind of this. They want to please their young fan base. Eventually they caved to pressure and now the most valuable NFL data is available to the public.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s this got to do with Judaism? Mysticism? Rationalism?</p>
<p>One of my favorite Torah scholars is Chacham Jose Faur. One of his favorite theories about the relationship between Maimonidean rationalism and mysticism / kabbalah is very relevant to this decision by the NFL.</p>
<p>Chacham Faur believes that the core of the battle between rationalism and mysticism is the accessibility of knowledge. In the mystical view, kabbalah is received wisdom that comes from great scholars and is imparted to great scholars only. It is not accessible to the masses as it is deemed too dangerous or too esoteric for the common people to grasp. Laws  can be changed based upon this extremely private knowledge base and it can even usurp revealed Torah found in the Talmud. It is so powerful, yet so few can gain entry into the kabbalah club. It takes years of Torah study and personal growth to be worthy of hearing this mystical knowledge.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, we find the teachings of Maimonides. It was his desire to turn this model on its head. Knowledge was to be accessible to all. The Mishneh Torah was written so that everyone who could read was able to access the core text of Judaism. It no longer required a process by which one had to prove himself to be worthy of knowing the law. It was available to everyone. Free information.</p>
<p>This was one of the primary arguments against the Mishneh Torah. It made things too easy.</p>
<p>But to a rationalist, it is impossible to justify keeping wisdom locked away from the public. So Maimonides followed in the footsteps of R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi and made Torah accessible to all.</p>
<p>This tension exists today as well. On one hand we have groups that try to make kaballah more accessible to the masses. But most orthodox Jews find this unacceptable. On the other hand, we have Daas Torah die-hards who are buying into the same structure as the mystics of the medieval era did with regard to policy setting and halachic decisions. The Daas Torah skeptics are more universalist with their approach to Torah and thus believe that everyone has access to all of Torah, not just a select group of Torah giants.</p>
<p>It is harder than ever to maintain the model of the mystics. The NFL finally gave in to the side rationalism and granted the public access to their information. In the orthodox Jewish world a similar struggle is starting and is likely to continue for the next few years.</p>

<p>Remember the brouhaha from few months back when Matisyahu shaved his beard? We talked about it extensively on this blog over here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/13/the-shave-heard-round-the-world/">The Shave Heard ‘Round the World</a>. In that post we noted two primary things (in reverse order). 1) A beard is no big deal and 2) Orthodox Judaism is structured by definition and leaving chasidic Judaism might not save him the existential angst of being directed by religious constructs for most of one&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>That incident was directly addressed by Matisyahu and he tried to allay the fears of his orthodox Jewish supporters by letting them know he was still committed to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>This week, Matisayahu seems to have taken more drastic steps in his relationship with orthodox Judaism. Photographs of a bare-headed Matisyahu are circulating the Internet and an article on Ynet indicates that he has abandoned external displays of orthodox Jewish observance. At this moment, no public statement has been issued by Matisyahu to address these developments.<span id="more-5666"></span></p>
<p>First of all, how interesting is it that shaving his beard was &#8220;<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/13/the-shave-heard-round-the-world/">The Shave Heard ‘Round the World</a>&#8221; and this next step has barely registered a peep on the orthodox Jewish richter scale. I can think of three reasons this is the case. 1) A chasid shaving his beard is a bigger deal than a clean shaven orthodox Jew taking off his yarmulka. 2) Once he shaved his beard dropping orthodox Judaism was to be expected (by superficial people) so no one is surprised by this. 3) His public statement helped fuel the discussion last time and this time he has been silent.</p>
<p>More importantly, what are we to make of this story?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin by saying how difficult it must be to live in the music industry and the orthodox Jewish community. Indeed, it seems impossible. Not just because of the challenges inherent in living in two worlds with vastly different priorities, but because of the orthodox community&#8217;s reluctance to accept the compromises that are inevitable in a situation like this one. What I mean is that the orthodox Jewish community has standards that it expects of the people associated with orthodox Judaism. Some of these standards are arbitrary. For example, in some places tznius is more important than honesty in business. Improper dress will invite negative attention but a trial for fraud will not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these standards exist and they are routinely enforced by social convention. I have a feeling that being a rock star crosses the social standards of most orthodox Jewish communities. Despite one&#8217;s personal beliefs and practices, the mere existence of a pop star career is enough to discredit one&#8217;s affiliation with orthodox Judaism. This is not because it is impossible to manage both or that being a Hollywood celebrity is a violation of a Torah or Rabbinic statute. [It is possible and "I told you so" sentiments are awfully childish]. It is because the social environment of orthodox Judaism simply does not tolerate it.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that a bare-headed male is likely to be considered persona non grata in the orthodox Jewish community. This is true despite the possibility that the bare-headed Jewish male is more stringent in a myriad of other laws and customs. In other words, the true level of one&#8217;s observance becomes irrelevant. The lines are drawn and enforced by social convention, not objective truth.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that in many industries, men go to work without a yarmulka and just 30 years ago it was considered acceptable and normal for orthodox Jewish males to go to work without a yarmulka. Isn&#8217;t Matisyahu entitled to the same latitude in his line of work? Somehow, I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Most importantly, in my opinion, is the predictable complaint of the orthodox Jewish Mayisyahu fan.<em> &#8220;Matisyahu, you were our hero, how could you do this to us? How could you abandon us? Don&#8217;t you see how much it pains us to see you struggle with your religious observance?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In my opinion, this is obscene. None of us own Matisyahu. He doesn&#8217;t need to consider us when he makes his choices. It&#8217;s his life and he needs to live with whatever decision he makes. We don&#8217;t. In fact, I have a sneaking suspicion that all the pressure of &#8220;representing orthodox Judaism&#8221; had more than a little bit of a negative effect on Matisyahu. Imagine a world where your every action is scrutinized by the media on the one side and on the other side by your fellow orthodox Jews. Imagine having to live up to the impossible standard of perfection that was seemingly demanded of him. Imagine a life where one&#8217;s choice to become orthodox / chasidic no longer felt like a choice and instead felt like living up to someone else&#8217;s perception of what one should be.</p>
<p>It couldn&#8217;t have been easy.</p>
<p>And so I say, let the poor man be. Obviously he is going to through a lot. Some of the most talented people in the world deal with so much existential angst. Stop propping him up to be our religious superhero. Don&#8217;t expect anything out of him other than good, (hopefully) clean, inspirational music. He is not our paradigm or example of perfection. He is just another Jewish dude struggling with the same things we all struggle with albeit in a much more public manner.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/spartan-warriors-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5664" title="spartan-warriors-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/spartan-warriors-2-300x204.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></a>This weekend, Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel granted Mishpacha Magazine an interview. I presume that when a orthodox Jewish publication interviews an orthodox Jewish public figure, the idea is to give the public figure an opportunity to set the record straight on any ambiguous issues and paint the public figure in a positive light. This is what makes this interview so odd. It didn&#8217;t quite work out that way.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zwiebel briefly addressed what has become a cornerstone issue for most sane people, sex abuse in the orthodox Jewish community. The expressly stated position of the Agudath Israel of America on this matter was ostensibly formed by the Moetzes Gedolei Yisroel. These Torah giants have determined that an orthodox Jew who is told about abuse should speak with a rabbi who in turn will advise them if they should proceed to the police. There is no central list of qualified rabbis to address this hairy question. Unluckily, Rabbi Zwiebel is constantly in the extremely difficult position of defending this position.</p>
<p>Invariably, Rabbi Zwiebel changes the discussion from the policy to the bloggers, or the falsely accused, or the assault of Daas Torah to deflect the criticism. It&#8217;s a poor strategy and it is not working. A couple weeks ago, an Agudah employee asked his Twitter followers and Facebook friends, I fit both categories, what Agudah could do to change the negative public perception about their abuse policy. I responded that they should change the policy. They haven&#8217;t. The point is that Agudah is aware of the public backlash.</p>
<p>The Mishpacha interview was more of the same and it spawned two very strident posts by my two favorite bloggers, <a href="http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2012/06/agudah-acknowledges-dropping-ball-on.html" target="_blank">Rabbi Slifkin</a> and <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2012/06/zweibel-paraphrased-better-thousand.html" target="_blank">DovBear</a>.<span id="more-5663"></span> When strident posts like theirs are written, the apologists take to the airwaves. In their best attempt to mete out measure for measure, the apologists counter attack. They call those who dare question the authority of the great rabbis heretics, rabble-rousers, angry, no longer orthodox, and a litany of other offenses.</p>
<p>What strikes me is that the apologists often wind up championing positions or ideas that those they are defending would not agree with. In other words, the rabbis these people are defending tooth and nail don&#8217;t necessarily agree with their world wide web warriors.</p>
<p>I can attest to this. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/27/why-is-the-internet-asifa-at-citifield-for-men-only/" target="_blank">When I questioned the folly of disallowing women from attending the Asifa</a>, I was called all kinds of names. But the truth was that the rabbis who these name callers were defending actually agreed with my position. They wanted the women to attend. I can&#8217;t be a jerk or kofer for suggesting the very thing that the rabbis wanted. When I questioned the wisdom of a one-size-fits-all Internet solution I was lambasted. I subsequently discovered that several Gedolim agreed with that position as well. How can I be a horrible person for agreeing with some of the Gedolim?</p>
<p>I think a little of the same thing happens when people attack Rabbi Slifkin and DovBear. The apologists take more hardline positions than those who they are defending. They invoke crazy <em>svaros</em> and obscure statements from earlier rabbis, that the ones whom they are defending would never use. Their positions are always more nuanced than their apologists. The other side of the same coin is that the dissenters oftentimes understand the position they take issue with as more extreme than it was intended.</p>
<p>Apologists come in many shapes and forms representing many ideologies and positions. In politics I see the same thing. Politicians from either side of the aisle are much more willing to compromise than their constituents. It&#8217;s easy to be an extremist fundamentalist when you have no responsibility or consequences to your actions. But when the fate of others rests in your hands, and you are a good person, you are going to consider more than your most fundamentalist position. Public policy, whether it is religious or political is usually a combination of compromises. There are no true socialists and no true capitalists in government. They realize that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I think the apologists for the Gedolim need to take a deep breath and realize that the American Gedolim generally do not choose extremist positions. Similarly, most of the educators in our schools are not as extreme or unreasonable as the <em>parents</em> of the children in their schools. We cannot  allow the apologists and extremists to hijack or become the leaders of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>That being said, on the issue of abuse, the time has come for the Gedolim to really learn and appreciate what happens to victims of abuse. I honestly do not think they understand the gravity of the situation and perhaps if we educated them, their policy could change. If you would like to assist me or direct me in how to do this, please be in touch.</p>
<p>And for the record, my charedi poskim do not agree with the position of the Moetzes and they recommend going to the authorities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/xojane_logo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5611" title="xojane_logo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/xojane_logo-300x102.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="102" /></a>(If you haven&#8217;t read Chaya&#8217;s article, you&#8217;ll need to read that first. Click: <a href="http://www.xojane.com/relationships/hasidic-women-sex" target="_blank">XOJane</a>)</em></p>
<p>I am very happy that you have found personal satisfaction in your religious life. I am also happy you took to the Internet to profess your love for your personal relationship with God (and apparently your husband). I honestly wish every orthodox Jewish woman was as religiously fulfilled as you are. However, sadly this is not the case.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the real issues I take with your effusive article.</p>
<p>You represented your subjective experience as the objective experience of chasidic women. Making things worse, you failed to disclose in the article many important factors that contributed to your personal experience. Indeed, you made them clear in the comments, but it was too little, too late.</p>
<p><span id="more-5610"></span></p>
<p>You were not born into orthodox Judaism. That means that you actually chose the life you live. That&#8217;s amazing and I am so happy for you that you arrived at what I believe to be the truth on your own. But the simple fact is that people who are born into orthodox Judaism don&#8217;t choose it. This means that they are stuck. For better or for worse. Some people are thrilled to be stuck. Others, not so much. But this means that while you feel like you are free to as you please. I am sure you realize that if an orthodox woman would put on &#8220;pants and go snort coke&#8221; she would probably be asked to leave the community and be handed a quick divorce and lose custody of her children. So it is not as free as you intimate. It might feel free to you because you chose it. But it is not free.</p>
<p>The second thing that you did not disclose, and this is a far more egregious error, is that you are a member of the Chabad sect of chasidus. The reason this is so crucial is because Chabad is different than every single other chasidic sect. There are absolutely no social correlations between Chabad and the other sects of chasidus. None.</p>
<p>In the words of Hella Winston (quoted from <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/04/29/book-review-unchosen/" target="_blank">Unchosen</a>):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>With its “mitzvah tanks”, campus Chabad houses, celebrity stuffed fundraising telethons, and outposts across the globe, Lubavitch has become almost synonymous with Hasidism. This despite the fact that in the United State it numbers less than half the size of Satmar and is hardly representative of the Hasidic community as a whole. With their mission – unique in the Hasidic world – to attract unaffiliated Jews, Lubavitchers are raised to engage (Jewish) outsiders, doing missionary work wherever Jews are found around the world. [...]</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This emphasis on proselytizing has meant that a significant percentage of Lubavitchers were not born in the community but joined by choice. Often those who join [...] have led formerly secular lives, which likely included a college education or beyond. [...] Additionally, Lubavitch raises a substantial amount of money from non-Hasidic Jews [...]. All of this is strong contrast to the other Hasidic sects, which include Satmar, Ger, Viznitz, Belz, Bobov, Skver, Sponka, Pupa and Breslow, to name only a few. In these sects, almost all members are born into the community, and none engages in formal outreach, making them comparatively more insulated from , and less aware of, the ways of the outside society than their counterparts in Lubavitch.</em></p>
<p>You see, the insular chasidic sects bear no resemblance to this world you love. Their world is even more closed and more insular. So your personal experience, while wonderful, has no relevance to the world of chasidic women in the insular sects of Satmar, Ger, Vizhnitz, Square, etc. More importantly, their world is a world where women are more oppressed than in the rest of orthodox Judaism. There are rules against driving, getting an education, men and women walk on separate sides of the street in some communities, there are very strict rules about sex, many women shave their heads, girls are wed after extremely short meetings to young men they barely know, they must wear synthetic (bad looking) wigs, can&#8217;t wear latest fashions (even the modest ones), I could go on and on. The point is that in these communities, women don&#8217;t feel the great freedom and empowerment that you feel.</p>
<p>Ironically, by ignoring all this omitted information, you are causing a disservice to chasidic women everywhere. You make it sound like things are all honky-dory. But they are not. I am sure many chasidic women love their lot in life. But your experience has no bearing on theirs. In fact, I would bet you wouldn&#8217;t last a week in Kiryas Joel or New Square! The things you love about your Judaism are simply not present in those uber-insular communities.</p>
<p>But the most difficult thing about your article is that it completely ignores that plain fact that in halacha, women can easily be perceived as second class citizens. This is an incontrovertible fact. Women cannot be rabbis, cantors, judges, witnesses in Beis Din, and they aren&#8217;t counted as part of a minyan. Women&#8217;s dress codes are medieval, their stained underwear is checked by rabbis, they are discouraged from using contraception, they don&#8217;t study the most important text of orthodox Judaism &#8211; the Talmud (because they are assumed to have weaker minds), and they don&#8217;t take positions of authority. Heck the women in Crown Heights are not even allowed to vote on communal issues! I am well aware of the various apologetics and interpretations of these rules. It could be argued that women have an elevated role and do not require the encumbrances of mitzvah observance. I have used them and taught them myself. Some people buy those explanations, but many others do not. It&#8217;s great that so many orthodox Jewish women are happy with their place in orthodox Judaism, but it is completely reasonable for women inside the system and outside the system to perceive orthodox Judaism as oppressive to women.</p>
<p>In sum, I respect your healthy exuberance for your Chabad lifestyle. I think it&#8217;s great. Share the love. By all means. But please do not generalize and use terms like &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; to describe your personal experience. Not only is it disingenuous, it actually harms the cause of those who are trying to advocate for women&#8217;s rights and opportunities in the chasidic and otherwise orthodox Jewish women. The future of orthodox Judaism will need to make adjustments to the way we deal with women issues (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/06/13/the-future-of-women-in-orthodox-judaism/">The Future of Women in Orthodox Judaism</a>). Pretending it is perfect as it is, sets us backwards several decades.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/future.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5547" title="future" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/future-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>A few weeks ago, the Spring issue of the Klal Perspectives Journal was released. I noted the excellent article written by Moishe Bane and recommended that everyone read it. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/24/klal-perspectives-spring-2012-one-excellent-article-stands-out-from-the-rest/" target="_blank">Klal Perspectives Spring 2012: One Excellent Article Stands Out From the Rest</a>)</p>
<p>I mentioned in passing that I had my own response to some of the issues that were discussed in the journal.</p>
<p><a href="http://klalperspectives.org/spring-2012/spring-12-questions/" target="_blank">Writers were asked to address three questions</a>. They are more fully developed on the Klal Perspectives site. These are the questions in general terms:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>How accurate is the perception that there is a crisis in the degree of religious fulfillment experienced by observant Jews?</em></li>
<li><em>What is the source of this alienation and what can be done to cure it?</em></li>
<li><em> Are there proven methods to inspire observant Jews experiencing a gap in religious enthusiasm?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="more-5544"></span></p>
<p>I begin with three short answers. 1. Fairly accurate. 2. Modernity and a fresh approach. 3. No.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Judaism of the Future</h2>
<div>
<p>In my personal experience, I have come across a lot of people that would somewhat fit into this broad category. All of them know others in the same situation as well. So I would say the numbers are higher than just the number of people I know of personally. Of those people, there is a general feeling of malaise about religion. Some are apathetic to their plight and others are anguished by it. The apathetic ones are resigned to a marginalized relationship with God and their religion. The ones in anguish wish they could turn back the clock to their yeshiva days when they felt something special or they dream of living up to the lofty goals of <em>dveykus</em> and spiritual nirvana.</p>
<p>I think there is a need to discuss this issue. It is a legitimate problem and is definitely causing discomfort among many orthodox Jews. Would I call it a crisis? I don&#8217;t know. What is of greater concern is that the issue is framed as an issue of <em>perception</em>. The question implies that happy, fulfilled orthodox Jews are looking at others and are concerned that others are not feeling fulfilled. That is what perception means. I would prefer if the question focused on the actual people who are feeling burnt out of religion and not the assumptions or judgments of others. So I would rather adjust the question to: Is there a significant group of orthodox Jews who feel under-fulfilled by their Judaism?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is undoubtedly, yes.</p>
<p>The more interesting question is the second question. Where does this spiritual melancholy come from?</p>
<p>It was hard to pinpoint a consensus among the journal writers on this point. Most of the writers attributed the problem to a flaw or misstep in <em>Avodas Hashem </em>(religious observance). As I remarked in a previous post, Moishe Bane pointed more toward phenomena outside Mitzvah observance that affect one&#8217;s spiritual psyche. While I agree in form, I have a different twist on the substance. I think there is something that is being overlooked in these discussions and that is the historical context of orthodox Judaism&#8217;s rise and its place in the modern world.</p>
<p>Taking a big step back and looking at orthodox Judaism from a bird&#8217;s eye view gives one an interesting perspective of theology in orthodox Judaism. We have the canonized books of Tanach. The stories in Tanach are replete with miracles, Divine communications with people, complex heroes and villains, struggles with idol worship, violence and war, and stories of high drama. The lens with which these stories are viewed in orthodox Judaism is through the lens of <em>Chazal</em> and then through the eyes of the <em>Rishonim</em> who elucidate the teachings of <em>Chazal</em>.</p>
<p>Then we have the <em>Mishnah</em>, <em>Talmud</em>, various <em>midrashic</em> sources, and their numerous commentaries. The world of <em>Chazal</em> was also a fantastic world that talks of miracles brought about through acts of the saintly <em>Tannaim</em> and <em>Amoraim</em>, an awareness of angels and demons, a hybrid of folk medicine, real medicine, and faith healing, and many other ideas and expressions that were appropriate for Ancient Greece and the medieval era.</p>
<p>More recently, we have the writings of the <em>Arizal</em> and his students. Somewhat related, we have the works of the <em>baalei</em> <em>mussar</em> and the <em>Chassidus</em> which paralleled it. These teachings focus on a transcendental version of Judaism. Their focus on perfection of character and mind, hearkens the typology of a superJew. The person who is complete control of his life, thoughts, and actions. All of it with cosmic proportions. One misstep and worlds are affected. The ultimate goal of these works is to elevate the Jew from man to [almost] angel. But the payoffs are lofty. <em>Ruach</em> <em>HaKodesh</em>, understanding dreams, granting blessings that come true, and practical mystic powers are part and parcel of this genre.</p>
<p>Throughout the last 2000 years, various codes of halacha have been codified as well. The primary sources used today are the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> and the <em>Mishnah</em> <em>Brurah</em> on <em>Orach</em> <em>Chaim</em>. The status of halacha has been cemented for several hundred years. To be lenient, based on a <em>rishon</em> or <em>gaon</em> not quoted in the <em>Shulchan</em> <em>Aruch</em> is considered unacceptable. Removing statutes that were based on mistakes or assumptions that have been shown to be incorrect is not really permissible. Historical social norms that helped establish <em>halacha</em> are not considered when analyzing <em>halacha</em> today.</p>
<p>I believe this is a fair overview of the basic corpus of Torah that is studied today by orthodox Jews. I also believe that the descriptions of those general bases of knowledge are accurate and I do not mean them in a disrespectful or cynical way. At all.</p>
<p>But herein lies the problem, I think.</p>
<p>The kind of life a Jew expects his religion to provide for him is completely unrealistic in modern terms. We are not going to debate or discuss the veracity or meaning of the fantastic claims made in each of these genres of Torah study. But we are going to assume that this is the world the average orthodox Jew associates with his religion. Years of studying about open miracles, direct communication with God, demons, angels, mystical universes affected by man&#8217;s acts, practical kabbalistic feats, and the like, has an effect on the one doing the studying. Its effect is that the person associates the religion with these things.</p>
<p>We hear about stories of great Jewish leaders who made incredible things happen. Whether it is Choni HaMa&#8217;agel (drawing a circle and demanding rain &#8211; and it worked), Reb Yochanan (turning people into bags of bones with his eyes), Rashi (born after his father tossed a diamond to the sea), Reb Yehuda HaChassid (the wall that moved to save his life), the Baal Shem Tov (flying around Europe), The Arizal (locating ancient graves by &#8220;sense&#8221;), my great-great-grandfather Reb Elya Lopian (meeting Eliyahu HaNavi), or the Chazon Ish (knowing how to do brain surgery) all these stories reinforce the idea that Jews can do supernatural things if we could just get to that level.</p>
<p>Orthodox Jews are generally smart, well educated (at least in comparison with the majority of the rest of the world), come from good, balanced homes, and are generally part of the middle to upper class of society. In my experience, most people who believe the type of legends, stories, and anecdotes that are taught in yeshivos are less advanced in every other way.</p>
<p>Allow me to explain. In ancient times <em>everybody</em> believed the kinds of things that are described in the Talmud. In medieval times <em>everyone </em>believed in the kinds of things the <em>rishonim</em> speak of. In early modern times <em>almost everybody</em> believed in the same kinds of things we find in <em>mussar</em> <em>seforim</em> and <em>chassidus</em>. The folk cures and superstitions that have crept into <em>halacha</em> were <em>common for the people of their time</em>. Today, the only people who still believe such things are looked at as backward or relics of the past.</p>
<p>I am not using this analysis to judge whether these things are true or whether they are essential to our religion. I am only making the following point: Many of the very basic assumptions of orthodox Jews were prevalent in the rest of the world, each in their time, but they have been discarded by smart, successful, happy people in the non-orthodox Jewish world. They <em>used to believe </em>in similar ideas and stories, but they <em>no longer</em> believe in them.</p>
<p>In other words, it used to be <em>normal</em> to believe in these fantastic abilities and tales. <em>Everyone did it.</em> This was their way of  life. It could be explained by pointing to all the unanswered questions that are prevalent in their understanding of the universe. They had no better explanation for various phenomena. Rather they had to believe in the supernatural on a regular basis. God was responsible for everything because they had no other explanation. But now, it is only religious fanatics, naive people, those who live in undeveloped countries and other indigenous groups that still have maintain these kinds of fundamentalist beliefs because for the most part, they are either wrong or unnecessary.</p>
<p>At this point, the orthodox Jew, is confronted with two basic options. Either the beliefs of orthodox Judaism that go against modern sensibilities are true and the beliefs that everyone who was not an orthodox Jew, which were nearly identical in substance and identical in form, were not true in the first place, so it is still reasonable to believe and this is an example of the people of the world &#8220;not getting it&#8221;. <em>Or</em>, orthodox Jews and everyone else believed in the same kinds of things a long time ago, the fact that society as a whole has moved on is indicative that the beliefs are flawed and perhaps many of them are untrue.</p>
<p>Again, I am only pointing to the options, and not to the validity of either position. I am merely stating what I believe are the reasonable options available to a modern Jew when considering traditional orthodox Jewish beliefs in our modern times.</p>
<p>To me, this is the underlying, unexpressed issue that lies beneath the surface and causes the most internal angst and frustration with regard to spiritual success. The goals are impossible to achieve. None of my friends from yeshiva have <em>ruach</em> <em>hakodesh</em>. None of my <em>rebbeim</em> from yeshiva perform miracles. The universe of our heroes simply does not exist anymore. None of us has experienced or witnessed the kinds of things that are such an integral part of our lore.</p>
<p>Yet, the majority of what we learn today was borne out of that universe. The kind of relationship <em>they </em>had with the Almighty is not able to be reproduced in a modern society. Whereas, every nook and cranny of life was a connection to something Greater, due to a lack of sophistication or flawed understanding of science or a general mood of superstition, the world in which they lived was a world where God was found in everything at all times. It was so easy. In those days, it was stupid to <em>not s</em>ee God in everything. But in our modern times, where we have answers to many questions, we have reasonable explanations for many things that were mysterious in the past, where we know that superstition is bunk, all that seems so distant, so impossible, and so different from our world.</p>
<p>This causes one of two things to happen. For some people, the ideals become too lofty. &#8220;Oy, I&#8217;ll never find the supernatural in my life.&#8221; If all your life you&#8217;ve been striving for something that simply does not happen anymore, the frustration is going to be overwhelming. The result is apathy toward religion.</p>
<p>But for others, the skeptics among us, it can cause people to throw out the baby with the bathwater. It all goes down the drain. &#8220;If Chazal were wrong about some things, maybe they were wrong about everything.&#8221; If our religion has similar characteristics to ancient pagan cults, to other religions, and to medieval folklore, which parts are &#8220;real&#8221;? These people will by and large either leave orthodoxy, become orthoprax, or live in the agony of what they believe to be two mutually exclusive truths.</p>
<p>If I were asked to point at what I believed to be causing spiritual malaise among Klal Yisrael, I would point to this. The idea that our religion has so many characteristics that are similar to clearly false beliefs and that the world of our religious heroes is a world that for the most part, no longer exists.</p>
<p>So what is the cure?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not simple nor is it something that I see happening anytime soon. But I think that R&#8217; Soleveitchik was on the right path in this regard. A new, modern understanding of Judaism and our culture needs to be cultivated. We cannot base our theology on ancient Greek methodologies, or Muslim and Christian approaches from the Middle Ages. If we are confident that we have the truth, and I believe we do, we must believe that it is can be reconciled with modernity with absolute fealty to the words of Chazal which are binding and the halacha that flows from those words. I am not advocating that we abandon halachic Judaism, <em>chas v&#8217;shalom</em>. I am advocating for a new approach to Torah that uses modern ideas <em>much in the same way Chazal used ideas from their time </em>and all the great Jewish thinkers over the last 2000 years up until recently.</p>
<p>It can start with our education system and approach to the non-orthodox and to the non-Jews in our world. We have transplanted a model from a time of blood libels, of pogroms, and of Jew hatred, that led to the Holocaust in Europe and are trying to implement it in a free, safe, and friendly United States of America. It&#8217;s just more of the same. We can&#8217;t expect those models to work anymore. It&#8217;s a brave new world. It&#8217;s a <em>different </em>world. And just as we can&#8217;t expect that style of <em>chinuch </em>(education) to work on these shores, we can&#8217;t expect that what inspired and fascinated a water carrier or a farmer in Europe circa 1730 would inspire and fascinate an accountant or an attorney today.</p>
<p>On an individual level, I strongly recommend that people trying to find their place in orthodox Judaism by finding the things that they like. Exploit them. Enjoy them. Focus on what makes you feel good religiously and what inspires you. All the while, maintaining strict adherence to <em>halacha</em> and conforming to the standards of one&#8217;s community. But don&#8217;t expect the kinds of returns that our great-great-grandparents had. It was a different world with different challenges. What you should expect is that you can have a <em>2012 type of relationship with God and Judaism.</em> Set that kind of realistic goal and a lot of disappointment and apathy can be avoided.</p>
<p>I really believe that this is not only possible, but necessary. I think we can do it and that we must do it. Each era of Judaism had its challenges and configured a form of orthodox, <em>halachic</em> Judaism to meet those challenges all while remaining strictly adherent to the <em>daled amos shel halacha</em>. We can do the same for the future of our Judaism. We can move past the model of early modern history based on the romanticization of European pre-war shtetl life and forge our own beautiful, successful, passionate orthodox Judaism of the future.</p>
<p>To answer the third question, this method is not proved to work. It is a suggestion that I am confident has some merit. I hope that we can make the adjustments that we need to ensure that our children and grandchildren feel a similar, yet different passion, as our parents and grandparents did before us. I think we can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><div id="attachment_5510" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Orthodox-articleLarge.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5510" title="Orthodox-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Orthodox-articleLarge-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: NY Times</p></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s New York Times features a below the fold, front page article on sex abuse in the Hasidic community of New York. It&#8217;s usually not a good thing when orthodox Jews are on the front page of a newspaper, even below the fold. I am aware that this article reflects poorly on Hasidic Jews in particular and orthodox Jews in general. But I have to say that I found the article to be pretty fair overall and an excellent assessment of the situation.</p>
<p>Contra the article in the Forward, this article does not focus on DA Hynes (although it seems there will be an article about him tomorrow), the article in the NY Times focuses on the victims and the social pressure not to report incidents of abuse.</p>
<p>This is the real problem. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</p>
<p>The article tells the story of several victims and their families who did report the abuse to authorities only to find that they were shunned, excommunicated, or bought off. </p>
<p><span id="more-5509"></span></p>
<p>According to the article it goes all the way to the top. A family member of the Vizhnitz Rebbe in Monsey is alleged to have offered $20,000 to a victim&#8217;s family to drop charges. This is not some low level handler. This is not some shnook with a printer posting signs. This is the Grand Rebbe&#8217;s family. If that is how the leadership of thousands of Hasidic Jews handles abuse, what are we to expect from his followers?</p>
<p>Justice Guston L. Reichbach is a hero for standing up to the support of the community behind the accused and the lack of support for the victim. In court, he expressed deep disappointment with the community&#8217;s response in support of the abuser. He said there was a<em> &#8220;communal attitude that seeks to blame, indeed punish, victims.”</em> He also rebuked the multitude of Hasidic Jews in the courtroom standing in support of the abuser for writing letters in support of the defendant without a single word of <em>&#8220;any concern or any sympathy or even any acknowledgment for these young victims, which, frankly, I find shameful.”</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It was nice to see the workaround for <em>mesira</em> suggested by one rabbi, to tell a psychologist about the abuse and the psychologist will report it. This is completely unnecessary of course. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/">Mesira (The Jewish Informant) in Halacha</a></p>
<p>In addition to the text of the article, there are several very interesting documents attached. Take some time to read them. They are worth investigating.</p>
<p>Also, it is worth noting that there is no greater incidence of abuse in the ultra-orthodox community. There is just a much lower rate of reporting.</p>
<p>But the most difficult and heartbreaking part of the entire article was the quote from Rabbi Zweibel of the Agudah.</p>
<p>First of all, the Agudah has nothing to do with this. Hasidic groups could not care less what the Agudah says about sex abuse. So his quote is a non-sequitor. But he was asked his opinion and he reaffirmed with what we already know. His organization believes that a victim should go to a rabbi before going to the police. To be fair, the Agudah <em>expects </em>rabbis to be reasonable and advise bona fide victims to go to the police. However, there is little evidence that this will happen. I should also add that this is a step forward, believe it or not. It used to be that one was prohibited to go to the police at all, now one can go if a rabbi advises it. Baby steps.</p>
<p>But the worst part about what he said was this brusque comment: <em>&#8220;You can destroy a person’s life with a false report&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Absorb that for a moment.</p>
<p>The concern is that a false report could ruin someone&#8217;s life. I have two things to say about this. Both are very important.</p>
<p>First, this is built on a fallacious assumption. That is, that only rabbis have the ability to sniff out a false report and further that law enforcement is incapable of doing this task on their own. Both of this are horribly wrong. Rabbis are not trained to discern between true allegations, innuendo, and pure fabrication. Law enforcement professionals are trained to do that. They do it with regularity and with much success. Charges are not brought unless law enforcement is convinced that the abuse happened AND that it could be proved in a court of law. To say that rabbis are needed to protect innocent people who are falsely accused overstates their abilities and understates the reality.</p>
<p>But much, much, much more important is the implication of this policy. Victims of abuse have their entire lives ruined. One cannot overstate the effect of sexual abuse on a person. It haunts them every day of their life. Contemplating suicide is a normal response for a victim of abuse. It can become impossible for victims to function normally. Indeed, many victims have taken their own lives, unable to cope. Sex abuse kills. There are great rabbis who have held that an abuser is a <em>rodef</em>, a pursuer who is trying to kill someone, and anything and everything that can be done to stop them <em>must </em>be done. Sex abuse <em>destroys people&#8217;s lives.</em></p>
<p>I have <em>never </em>heard of someone who was falsely accused of a crime who committed suicide, who could not have a relationship with his or her spouse, who could not love, who could not trust, who could not cope with life. Is it an inconvenience? Absolutely. I  would not wish a false accusation on anybody. But to protect falsely accused people (which are a <em>very</em> rare occurrence) because it could ruin their life, when juxtaposed with the destruction caused by sex abuse comes off as so far removed from reality that it is scary.</p>
<p>To recap: Rabbis are not super-qualified to ascertain the truth of an accusation, law enforcement is qualified. False accusations are rare. When they occur they can harm a person&#8217;s life. To spare the falsely accused at the expense of victims is a heinous travesty of misplaced priorities. It is sick.</p>
<p>I want to end on a more positive note. My rabbis have all said that if one is a victim of abuse they <em>must </em>go to the police. These are ultra-orthodox rabbis. My point is that some rabbis get it. They were not the rabbis interviewed in the NY Times, but they are out there. <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/07/14/yadeinu-shafchu-es-hadam-hazeh/" target="_blank">As Rabbi Adlerstein wrote</a>, <em>&#8220;If your rov (rabbi) doesn’t get it, think of getting a new rov.&#8221;</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Melinda-Gates-300x300.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5483" title="Melinda-Gates-300x300" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Melinda-Gates-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>In the never ending battle over contraception, the bold faced names are usually the Catholic Church, Evangelicals, Conservatives, Democrats, Liberals. and Atheists. The Catholic Church in particular, has a comprehensive statement from the Pope banning the use of contraceptives for Catholics.</p>
<p>When it comes to setting Catholic policy, there is usually only one voice. The Church is that voice.</p>
<p>It takes a special kind of <em>chutzpah</em> and self-confidence to challenge the Church on anything, at least in public. Similar to right wing orthodox Judaism, in the wake of enlightenment and secularism, the Church asserted itself as authority to the exception of everyone else. It wields its power and the people listen. There is no discussion. There is no opportunity for the average person to have their opinion heard and debated by the powers that be. The leaders speak and the people are expected to listen.</p>
<p>In their excellent philanthropy work, the Gates duo of Bill and Melinda have spent billions of dollars in third world countries. Their focus has been on global health and development.<span id="more-5482"></span></p>
<p>One area that Ms. Gates speaks on is contraception. She believes strongly that family planning is wise for underdeveloped society. This makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>In one respect it seems as if Ms. Gates, a Catholic, is defying the teachings of her church. In fact, some people have called her out on this. Her response to them was</p>
<p><em>&#8220;as a practicing Catholic,&#8221; and &#8220;in the tradition of the great Catholic scholars,&#8221; it is &#8221; important to question received teachings,&#8221; in particular &#8220;the one saying that birth control is a sin.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I for one, was not aware that there was a tradition of great Catholic Scholars to challenge tradition. I though that was punishable by death. I also did not know that Ms. Gates was a great Catholic scholar. But I digress.</p>
<p>The important thing here is that a religious woman, who apparently loves her church and its teachings has decided on her own what the Church&#8217;s position ought to be. Almost all Catholic women use birth control. But I always thought that they just felt like ignoring the &#8220;correct&#8221; teachings of the Church. In the same way many call themselves &#8220;Bad Catholics&#8221;, they defy their religious leaders on this matter. But Ms. Gates is going a step further. She is saying that the Catholic Church is wrong and that contraception should be permissible.</p>
<p>Angry, self-righteous, right-wing bloggers find this very offensive.</p>
<p>I find this fascinating as in many ways it mirrors the attitudes of some orthodox Jews today. Some say, I know the Gedolim are right, but I can&#8217;t listen to everything they say. Others say, the Gedolim are wrong about this specific thing and I am not going to listen to them when they are wrong.</p>
<p>At least in Judaism there is a strong tradition of challenging religious leaders. Although it seems as thought that tradition is being phased out in favor of a more Catholic model.</p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It turns out that Ms. Gates&#8217; comments were taken out of context. She explains herself admirably in the actual TED Talk. In fact, I think this speech should be watched by orthodox Jews too!<strong> Watch it here: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/melinda_gates_let_s_put_birth_control_back_on_the_agenda.html" target="_blank">Let&#8217;s put birth control back on the agenda</a> </strong></em>(thanks commenter milhouse537)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/WorldWideWeb.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5460" title="WorldWideWeb" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/WorldWideWeb-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="179" /></a>This is not a retraction.</p>
<p>I still think there are many reasons one <em>could</em> oppose the Asifa. I still think women <em>should</em> be able to attend too.</p>
[By the way, I was told by one of the organizers that there is a simple reason women are not attending. The reason is that a large contingent of Jews made it clear that they would only endorse and promote the event if the Asifa was for men only. But up until a few days ago, it was intended to be for men and women. I mention this because some people took severe offense to my suggestion that the Asifa be open to men and women. Clearly, the organizers wanted it to be for men and women, so it's a bit much to say I am being <em>mevazeh</em> the Gedolim when I question why it is for men only.]
<p>But, during the course of my conversation with one of the higher ups at the Ichud HaKehilos I learned a lot and I have something important to say about the Asifa.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>huge of community of people who I believe should attend the Asifa</strong>. The Asifa is playing an important role and despite the various flaws in vision and execution, it should be attended by a specific (large) category of orthodox Jews.<span id="more-5459"></span></p>
<p>For starters, the Asifa&#8217;s position is that the <strong>Internet should not be banned</strong>. Their position is that the Internet is a reality of our modern world. We have it. Let&#8217;s learn how to use it. This is a major step forward.</p>
<p>For 15 years orthodox Jews have been told that the Internet is assur. The notable exception was for business purposes. The most permissive position of the Gedolim has been that Internet use is permissible &#8220;when necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people adhered to this rule. Many did not. Most orthodox Jews that use the Internet are using it for business and pleasure. That means they use the Internet to read the news, learn about the world, follow sports, share photos and videos (of vorts, upsherins and cute babies) with friends and family, read blogs (not just the ones that are &#8220;bad&#8221;), and socialize (with people with whom it is permissible to socialize).</p>
<p>These people are Internet savvy. They know the risks, they know how to avoid the risks, and they are generally responsible about how they and their children use the Internet.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who listened to the advice of the Gedolim. They only use the Internet when necessary. They have Internet in their homes for business purposes. They have no idea what else is on the Internet and that their children can find everything that the parents are trying to protect them from with three or four clicks of a mouse. They don&#8217;t know that their children are going on the Internet on their mobile devices. They don&#8217;t know how to monitor their children&#8217;s use of the Internet, they don&#8217;t know how to protect their children or even themselves.</p>
<p>I am told that these people exist. And I believe it.</p>
<p>These people need to get to the Asifa. They need to learn about the dangers and the protections immediately. Sure, they could learn everything that the Asifa will teach them, you know, on the Internet. Or they could attend any of the local Internet safety programs that are well attended by non-orthodox Jews. But these people need to hear about these dangers and products from a source they trust. They need to hear it from rabbis or askanim who speak their language and carry the weight of the Gedolim behind their advice. Personally, I think this is unnecessary, but I believe that there is a huge audience for this kind of advice. Is it 40,000 people strong? I don&#8217;t know. But that&#8217;s a question of execution, not policy.</p>
<p>So if you are in the group of people, or you know others in that groups of people, go the Asifa or tell your friends to go to the Asifa. They need to be there.</p>
<p>The Asifa will educate and the Ichud HaKehilos will assist anyone who needs help in implementing the solutions you want to use. If you need help choosing or setting up a filter, you can call them for free tech support. If you don&#8217;t understand how a device works, the Ichud will help you too. I think it&#8217;s great. Frum tech support. It will be free and at your service. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, it&#8217;s a great idea.</p>
<p>A few final words. I do not agree that the Internet should only be used when necessary. I think it should be embraced as a modern tool for growth, relationships, Torah study, socializing, and acquisition of wisdom and knowledge. It seems that the Asifa is continuing down the road of &#8220;use it only when necessary.&#8221; I hope they come around to the more liberal view because I think we should think more positively, and harness the incredible power of the Internet for good.</p>
<p>I also think that framing the Asifa as a solution to the problems in our communities is flawed. It is its own problem and has its own solutions. The Asifa will not prevent people from leaving the fold, nor will it save marriages that are doomed, nor will it ensure that everyone <em>davens</em> with proper <em>kavvanah</em>, nor will it destroy skepticism. I sincerely hope that people are sophisticated enough to understand that those problems run much deeper than the Internet. Our c<em>hinuch</em> needs improvement. The Internet is not the broader problem here. It is <em>chinuch</em>. Destruction via the Internet is a symptom of a problem, not the actual problem. Treating symptoms may make us feel better but it does not solve anything.</p>
<p>Finally, the term &#8220;dangers of the Internet&#8221; means a lot of things to a lot of people. It seems that the Asifa is in fact most concerned with access to pornography. In our very lengthy conversation, the word &#8220;blog&#8221; was never mentioned in connection with the Asifa. I was pleased to learn this and I hope that this holds true.</p>
<p>However, there are other issues associated with the Internet. Like many permissible activities, it can be addictive. Awareness should be raised regarding this as well. Jut because something can be addictive does not mean it should be completely shunned. I also think that many people do consider blogs and &#8220;<em>kefira</em>&#8221; sites to be a major &#8220;danger of the Internet.&#8221; Obviously, these dangers are community specific and no general rules should be made. Lastly, some people consider social media an inherent &#8220;danger of the Internet.&#8221; This is a fallacy. Learn how to use the tools properly and it can be a wonderful and positive use of the Internet. Use them improperly and they can indeed be very dangerous for one&#8217;s physical and spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>My advice: If you have the Internet in your home (and I think you should), do not allow any non-adults to access the Internet without protections. The best way to do this is to create a new user account for non-adults that has limited access to the Internet for the account user. The proper protection can be ensured by <strong><em>only granting access to specific websites</em></strong>. That means that the account user can only access pre-approved sites. Don&#8217;t rely on a filter. Give them access to specific, pre-approved sites. No filter is foolproof. If you let them on social media sites, monitor their friends and interactions. Obviously, make sure you don&#8217;t let them onto the adult user account on the computer. Protect it with the best password in the history of passwords. Finally, don&#8217;t give your child or teen any devices that have Internet access. If you want to protect <em>yourself</em> from accessing specific sites there is no solution other than self control.</p>

<p>There are a million and one things to complain about regarding the Ichud HaKehilos Asifa at Citifield. Pretty much everyone has read the <a href="http://dteitelbaum.blogspot.com/2012/04/open-letter-to-ichud-hakehillos.html" target="_blank">excellent post by Dovid Teitlebaum</a> pointing out the fallacy of blaming the Internet for problems within the orthodox Jewish community. I wholeheartedly agree that positive chinuch is far more effective and valuable than bans, broad policies, filters, and fear.</p>
<p>I also understand that the Ichud HaKehilos believes that there is a legitimate reason to sincerely fear the Internet. I am willing to grant them the courtesy that the imaginary Internet boogeyman is the most pressing issue in the orthodox Jewish community for a moment. However, it completely boggles my mind how they can justify, on their own terms, one of their executive decisions.<span id="more-5448"></span></p>
<p>The latest advertisements of for the Asifa are out and they proclaim that the Gedolim endorse the Asifa. Interestingly, there are no specific American Gedolim who are mentioned and I have not heard of any bold faced names from America in support of the Asifa other than R&#8217; Matisyahu Solomon.</p>
<p>The new ads also announce that tickets are now on sale. You can have the privilege of attending the Asifa for just $10.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just one catch. 50% of orthodox Jews cannot attend. The entire Asifa is for men only.</p>
<p>This is unconscionable.</p>
<p>If the threat of the Internet is so great, as the Ichud HaKehilos claims, how in the world can they make the marquee event for awareness and education about the Internet exclusively for men?! Are women not susceptible to the harms of the Internet? Should mothers of our children not be educated about the dangers of the Internet?</p>
<p>I honestly cannot fathom how the Ichud HaKehilos can say on the one hand that the Internet is so dangerous and then on the other hand exclude the mothers who are home with their children more than their fathers and the teenage girls who are just as present online as teenage boys. If anything, the girls have more access to computers and Internet than boys in yeshiva!</p>
<p>Again, I don&#8217;t think anyone needs to go to this Asifa. But for the Ichud HaKehilos who feels that this is the most important issue of our time, there is absolutely no excuse for limiting attendance to men only.</p>
<p>This is just further evidence to me that the project is flawed, lacks leadership and vision, and is very hard to fully endorse.</p>
<p>Here is the ad:</p>
