				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>About a month ago the Star-K, a world renowned Kashrus agency, announced that they were certifying kosher phones. These phones have no access to the Internet, cannot place or receive text messages, cannot take photos, and most importantly, cannot be hacked to perform any of these tasks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not troubling to me that people would want a phone that is insulated from certain tasks. Although I think it is an unnecessary measure and perhaps counter productive, I don&#8217;t begrudge people their personal self control restraints.<span id="more-7468"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7469" alt="cert1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/cert1.jpg" /></p>
<p>What is troubling is that a kashrus agency is part of this initiative. A kashrus agency should be concerned with one thing and one thing only. Their singular concern should be the kosher status of the food. I don&#8217;t even think that a kashrus agency must concern itself with humanitarian or other ethical issues that may arise. I have no problem with a secondary agency coming in and providing a secondary level of supervision. But the kosher status of the food cannot be affected by anything other its status as kosher food.</p>
<p>So when I see a kashrus agency entering into the phone market, I see an agency that should be worried about kosher status of food but is now legislating morality. It&#8217;s not even as if the technical skills involved in kosher supervision overlap the neutering of cell phones. They have nothing to do with each other. I don&#8217;t think it is smart for kosher supervision to be intertwined or even related to morality supervision.</p>
<p>Similarly, when kosher supervision agencies make demands on the clientele or ambience of an eating establishment I believe they are overstepping their bounds. There are restaurants that are not allowed to be open at certain hours because they will lose their hechsher if they are open. This is far beyond the scope of kosher supervision. Tell me if the food is kosher and I will decide if I want to patronize the restaurant. That is all we need from a kashrus agency. The stretching of their authority serves no important purpose for the public. It seems to me that it is merely a self-serving, self-righteous way to legislate their morality. If they can legislate phones and who can eat where, what&#8217;s next?</p>
<p>I am not making a slippery slope argument. I am pointing out that there is no logical connection between the kosher status of food and the kosher status of a phone. There is also no relationship between the kosher status of a restaurant and whether teenagers are hanging out. In other words, the kashrus agencies are already legislating their morality. There is no reason to think it only will apply in these two instances because there is no connection between these two things and the kosher status of food.</p>
<p>We need to stop using the word kosher for things other than food. Yes, the word is a general term but it has evolved into a word that describes whether food can be eaten by orthodox Jews who keep kosher. We don&#8217;t eat anything that is not kosher. Using the word kosher for phones and Internet implies that the non-kosher versions are not allowed to be used. This is sophomoric and divisive.</p>
<p>If anything, the kashrus agencies should be concerned with the ethics and morality of the actual food. This is something they have resisted time and time again. I am not recommending they get into the ethics of food business, but if they must expand their business and purview of supervision I think that is the first place they should be looking to legislate seeing as they have the knowledge and expertise to monitor and report on that aspect of food production. But teens mingling and phones? They don&#8217;t belong there at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7128" alt="alaska-erosion-photo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" /></a>The fallout over the Doheny Kosher meat scandal continues. This week, the Jewish Journal reported that three kosher restaurants have dropped the RCC Hechsher in favor of alternative hechshers.</p>
<p>This can only mean one thing. RCC is not as good for the bottom line as the other hechshers. The only real reason a restaurant will switch is to increase business. It seems that RCC businesses are suffering. I have some first hand information from vendors that this is the case as well.</p>
<p>It goes even further. Shiloh&#8217;s Restaurant has a splash page of their website that assures customers that they are and always have been using Kehilla for their hechsher and not RCC. The note distances Shiloh&#8217;s from Doheny Kosher Meat as well. See the note here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gUiNl0R.png" target="_blank">Shiloh&#8217;s</a></p>
<p>All this can only mean one thing. A significant number of people have been spooked by the kashrus scandal. It goes so far that people need to be reassured that a kosher restaurant did not purchase any meat from Doheny.<span id="more-7127"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. The halachic authority who was counseled on this case and is a senior <em>posek</em> for the OU already said that there was no halachic problem for consumers or restaurants who bought from Doheny. The RCC has admitted there were issues and they are fixing them. Some of the restaurants that switched don&#8217;t even sell meat!</p>
<p>The point here is that people are basically ignoring the halachic psak given in this case. Who are these people? Are they <em>frummer</em> than halacha? Why would anyone be concerned if a restaurant got meat from Doheny? The psak is that there is no problem if one bought meat from Doheny? What are they worried about?</p>
<p>The funny thing is that people will harp on Daas Torah for every <em>chumra</em> or <em>hashkafic</em> nuance as long as it looks more frum. But the second Daas Torah says something is permissible those same people become independent thinkers who don&#8217;t rely on Daas Torah.</p>
<p>On the one hand I see this as an erosion of Daas Torah. Some might see that as a positive development. Some might see that as a negative development. Either way, it seems that people are not buying into Daas Torah completely. It&#8217;s only when it suits my <em>chumra</em> lifestyle or to marginalize others that I will listen to Daas Torah they say. On the other hand not trusting RCC (especially for dairy!) after a <em>psak</em> that says there is nothing to worry about from a halachic perspective, is a huge problem. If we do not rely on our <em>poskim</em> for <em>heter</em> we are in big trouble. I do not like the direction this is heading. We must be able to rely on <em>psak halacha, </em>especially when the halacha is lenient.</p>

<p>See: <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/05/04/agudath-israel-statement-on-magen-tzedek/">Agudath Israel statement on “Magen Tzedek”</a>. Of course Agudath Israel can&#8217;t post it on their own website because they don&#8217;t have one since the Internet is prohibited. Nonetheless they managed to leak the statement to the sinners who have blogs and news sites so that pretty much every single orthodox Jew will see the statement on the Internet. Ahhhh, the games we play&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, the statement makes a gross misrepresentation of Magen Tzedek, misunderstands its purpose, injects non-existent agendas into an otherwise somewhat worthy cause and as per usual, weakens the clout with which orthodox Jewish leaders have in the lives of orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>The statement makes the claim that Magen Tzedek seeks to redefine Kashrut and by implication, do away with the orthodox hechsher system. The effort is called a brazen one and its purpose is to undermine the religious tradition. The statement tells us to <em>&#8220;regard the new seal for what it is, a falsification of the Jewish religious heritage, and treat it accordingly.&#8221;<span id="more-4204"></span></em></p>
<p>I am embarrassed for them.</p>
<p>Hechsher Tzedek is not what Agudath Israel thinks it is. As I wrote way back when it was announced in December (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/12/16/kosher-supervision-and-ethics-supervision/">Kosher Supervision and Ethics Supervision</a>) the seal is supposed to run ALONGSIDE traditional hechsher symbols. The traditional symbol vouches for the kashrus of the food per halacha and the Hechsher Tzedek symbol vouches for the ethical concerns in mass food production.</p>
<p>It is NOT an attempt to undermine the mesorah. It is NOT a redefinition of kashrut and quite frankly, seems necessary in many instances to augment the failing oversight of the government in food production practices.</p>
<p>It has been argued that the new symbol would perhaps cause an unwitting kosher consumer to trust the hechsher Tzedek for the halachic kashrus and cause them to sin by eating food that is not in fact kosher, rather is ethically produced. In my opinion this is a ridiculous concern. No responsible kosher eating consumer buys food if there is a random kosher symbol printed on the label. All kosher consumers know that they need to vet any and all kosher symbils before relying on them. Hechsher Tzedek would be no different. There are already plenty of kosher symbols that are not relied upon by huge swaths of the Jewish community. I see no reason to be fearful that this particular symbol will cause sin.</p>
<p>I believe this statement was a mistake. The greater Jewish community would benefit from a Hechsher Tzedek alongside traditional kosher supervision. Agudath Israel is needlessly poking its head into a non-issue. By doing so they lose credibility and cause anguish and animosity among Jews for no reason. (And wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if Agudath Israel spoke with such gusto against sex abusers and orthodox Jewish criminals&#8230;?)</p>
<p>I hope Agudath Israel rethinks this statement.</p>

More discussion there: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/11/reform-jews-interested-in-kashrus.html">Reform Jews Interested in Kashrus</a></p>
<p>Ask most Orthodox Jews about Kashrus and Reform Judaism, you&#8217;ll most likely hear a snicker from the uninformed or a reference to the &#8220;Treyfe Banquet&#8221; (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/12/new-national-museum-of-american-jewish-history-in-philadelphia-apparently-misses-the-mark/">New National Museum of American Jewish History In Philadelphia Apparently Misses the Mark</a>) from the more informed. As far as I know, Reform Judaism has never officially sanctioned Kashrus observance.<span id="more-3302"></span></p>
<p>I remember reading an article 3 years ago about young Reform Jews pining to add more ritual observance to their summer camp experience. They wanted to add tefillin, kashrus and a more traditional Shabbos. At the time, I thought that was really cool. (read about it here: <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/reform_youth_flexing_their_ritual_muscle" target="_blank">The Jewish Week</a>).</p>
<p>Today, I saw another step in this direction referenced on Twitter (HT @<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/schnit/status/4586916221550592" target="_blank">schnit</a>). A new book has been published for Reform Jews that want to observe some level of Kashrus. Apparently, this is a first. The book tackles broader issues than simple dietary restrictions such as animal cruelty and treatment / paying laborers.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s great. I would only hope that just as Reform Jews are learning from the ideals of Orthodox Jews as far as Kashrus is concerned, Orthodox Jews can learn from the concern the Reform Jews express for animal cruelty and treatment / paying laborers.</p>
