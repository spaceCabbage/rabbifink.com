				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Pew conducted a study of Jews in America and has released a comprehensive report based on its findings. Nearly 2800 religious Jewish people were interviewed and the results of those interviews make up the model for the results of the study. It&#8217;s difficult conduct a study like this and achieve meaningful results. I am not a statistician nor can I compare the sample sizes used in this study with others. To my untrained eye, it seems small.</p>
<p>There are many very interesting findings to discuss. I have three things I want to say about the study.</p>
<p>First, people will point to the staggering number of orthodox Jews who are no longer orthodox. That number is 52%. It seems impossible to believe. That means that over half of people raised orthodox are no longer orthodox. Think about the orthodox Jewish friends and family you know. Does it make sense to say that over half of them are no longer orthodox? I don&#8217;t think so.<span id="more-7664"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7665" alt="jew-chp3-3" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp3-3.png" />If you drill down a bit you notice a couple of things. For starters, I know many people who say they were raised orthodox because they went to a yeshiva or modern orthodox school even if they weren&#8217;t frum at home. I went to school with several people like that. Those people certainly skew the numbers. After all, the study relied on self identification. There was no process to classify people into categories other than to ask them.</p>
<p>But the real key here what the numbers are for young people being raised in contemporary orthodoxy. Those numbers are impressive. 83% of people raised as orthodox Jews under the age of 30 stay. This is a huge success. It&#8217;s also a number that correlates with anecdotal evidence. So the people who were raised orthodox and no longer are orthodox are mostly older people. What does this mean?</p>
<p>It means one of two things or perhaps a hybrid of two. [It doesn't mean that orthodox Jews leave the fold in their 30's and 40's at alarmingly high rates.] It could either mean that orthodoxy is much stronger today than it was 20 and 30 years ago. People get a better Jewish education, there is more insularity, and the shift to ultra orthodoxy which outnumbers modern orthodoxy by nearly 10:1 in this demographic is working to keep more orthodox Jews orthodox. Alternatively, it signifies a shift in who attends orthodox schools. In other words, 20-30 years ago it was far more likely for a family to send a child to an orthodox school and identify as orthodox even if they were not totally observant of halacha. There was more cross-pollination and there were fewer non-orthodox options. So you wind up with more people from previous generations identifying as being raised orthodox even though they weren&#8217;t truly orthodox through and through. This is rarer today because we are more insular and non-orthodox or unaffiliated Jews feel less comfortable in orthodox institutions. The truth is likely a combination of the two but the latter does concern me.</p>
<p>Also, very few middle aged and older people consider themselves ultra-orthodox. It&#8217;s a youth movement. Sure, some mellow out and switch affiliation. But it&#8217;s also a recent phenomena that is sweeping orthodoxy. It&#8217;s pretty compelling evidence that what is happening now for the under 40 orthodox Jew is different from what their parents and grandparents experienced. It&#8217;s a different kind of Judaism. The numbers bear it out.</p>
<p>Next, the non-orthodox denominations are falling apart. The numbers support the rumblings and rumors regarding the demise of Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism is dwindling as well. Some orthodox Jews like to cheer while these two denominations begin to disappear. Others view it as a sign that those Jews must be saved and brought into orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I think that it is important for Judaism that non-orthodox denominations are strong and vibrant. I think that orthodox Jews should be concerned and make efforts to help revive non-orthodox Judaism. This sounds controversial and heretical but it&#8217;s really not. Orthodox Judaism is not going to magically become the Judaism for the 89% of non-orthodox Jews. We can either wish them well and watch them disappear or we can try to keep them connected to their Jewish heritage. I think the latter choice is preferable. Now we can either keep them connected by &#8220;making them orthodox&#8221; as if that is even possible, or we can rely on strong non-orthodox denominations to keep them in the fold. I think the latter choice is preferable here too. It&#8217;s certainly the more likely option to achieve widespread success. While resources are precious in the orthodox community, I think strengthening the non-orthodox denominations is a worthy endeavor. They are also our brothers and sisters. If we value what we have, we should do whatever we can to help them stay somewhat connected to their Judaism. A little bit of a good thing is a whole lot better than nothing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7666" alt="jew-chp4-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp4-2-306x600.png" /></p>
<p>The last thing for now are the numbers on belief in God. 96% of ultra-orthodox Jews are <em>certain </em>that there is a God. Certain. That&#8217;s a very high number. I also wonder how they can all be so certain. The modern orthodox number is 77%. Also a very high number for certainty. 8% of ultra-orthodox Jews believe but are less certain and 19% of modern orthodox Jews fit that description. I think that both of those numbers are really higher. Most people don&#8217;t think about belief in God. They just do it. But the question wasn&#8217;t simply about belief. The question measured the certainty of the believer. I am skeptical that someone can be certain of something without being able to make a compelling argument in favor of that certainty. How many of us can make that argument? If we can&#8217;t, can we be certain? <em>(Stay tuned for an essay on this issue sometime soon.)</em></p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting numbers in this section are the numbers of people who &#8220;do not believe.&#8221; Here the number for ultra-orthodox is 1% while it is 3% for modern orthodox. Practicing Judaism under a state of disbelief s not an easy proposition. If one doesn&#8217;t think the mitzvos and traditions have Divine meaning then they are bound to become a huge burden. However, orthopraxy &#8211; practicing Judaism despite disbelief is a growing trend. I wonder what these numbers will look like in a few years. It&#8217;s possible that more people who do not believe in God will feel comfortable in orthodox Judaism and they will grow as a public group. But it&#8217;s also possible that a rise in those numbers will inspire a thorough vetting of all orthodox Jews which would force all orthoprax Jews into a closet or out of orthodox Judaism altogether.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other interesting numbers to discuss. (97% of ultra-orthodox Jews have all or mostly Jewish friends. That&#8217;s insularity! How about only 57% of orthodox Jews are Republicans? And the support for Israel numbers need addressing as well.) Perhaps I will revisit the study and more of its social commentary in a future post. For now, these are the three things that jumped out at me.</p>
<p><em>Note: The orthodox people surveyed were all from Brooklyn, Monsey, and Lakewood. I think this might be significant.</em> (EDIT: This is imprecise. Those were the oversampled counties. My apologies.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7137" alt="DoubleLife-Cover" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DoubleLife-Cover-231x300.jpg" width="231" height="300" /></a>I received a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife: One Family, Two Faiths and a Journey of Hope</a> a few weeks ago. It took a while for me to actually  sit down and read the book but I read it over the weekend and will do my usual review with a side of analysis on the book.</p>
<p>The story is quite intriguing. A Jewish man who makes a living playing music at Church and a Christian woman who does the same fall in love, get married, and end up as orthodox Jews. There&#8217;s a lot of blanks to fill in and the book does a fair job of telling their story.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to notice the book&#8217;s most obvious shtick right away. The entire story is told in letters between Harold and Gayle. Harold&#8217;s letters are written in regular typeset and Gayle&#8217;s are in italics. I found this very distracting. I don&#8217;t like italics. But that might be a personal quirk.</p>
<p>The larger issue is that it seems so artificial. Everything is written in letter format. Even things that couples obviously already know about one another. Normal people do not write letters to each other that ask the big questions like &#8220;will we have a Christmas tree or Hanukkah bush in our home&#8221;. Normal couples do not express themselves in letters to the exclusion of anything else. Yet, the book expects us to believe that all these important conversations took place via letters. Either these are real letters, which is just odd or it&#8217;s a gimmick. Making things worse, in order for this to work logistically, the two of them are almost never together. He is writing about his life, she is writing about her life, but because of the format we rarely get a feel for what life is like for the two of them when they are together. Some people might like this format choice, but I did not. It was weird.</p>
<p><span id="more-7134"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> tells the reader a lot about how difficult life can be for intermarried couples. They really don&#8217;t fit in anywhere. The Christian community does not embrace Howard and Gayle and we all know how skeptical the Jewish community can be of intermarried couples. I was surprised that the more liberal branches of Judaism were so antagonistic toward Howard and Gayle. It could just be that this was their experience and others have had different experiences. But reading the book, one would think that Reform and Conservative rabbis and communities are not welcoming to intermarried couples. This might be true in general, but all one can say from the book is that this was the experience of this couple. I would not say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> dishonestly portrays the positions of other denominations to puff up orthodox Judaism, but it at some points it did feel like that a little bit.</p>
<p>The punchline of the book is that the one place that welcomed Howard and Gayle more than any other was the orthodox Jewish community. In the end, despite their reservations, especially Gayle&#8217;s, the couple settled in the orthodox Jewish community. Gayle had a full orthodox conversion and the couple is has been living as orthodox Jews ever since. I do admit to completely breaking down during the conversion scene in the book. It was very emotional and I felt that the book did an excellent job making the moment work as a true climax of the story.</p>
<p>I wish the book would have spent some more time dealing with the theology of becoming an orthodox Jew. Gayle struggles with it quite a bit and we are never really told what changed her mind from resistance to acceptance of orthodox Judaism. I suspect it was mostly an emotional decision but I thought we should have heard a bit more about the transition.</p>
<p>The book tells a great story, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> also seeks to carve out a place for intermarried couples in orthodox Judaism. On the one hand their story seems to say that they are welcome with open arms, but on the other hand it seems that more resources are needed to handle these situations in the orthodox community. To that end <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> promotes the website created by Howard and Gayle for intermarried couples <a href="http://j-journey.org">j-journey.org</a>. The site seems to focus on orthodox conversion exclusively.</p>
<p>This all leads me to the piercing unasked question raised by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. What should be the Jewish approach to intermarriage. In a generation where more Jews intermarry than &#8220;intramarry,&#8221; what is the best way to handle it?</p>
<p>As it stands now, we discourage intermarriage so vociferously that orthodox rabbis will not officiate the ceremony of an intermarried couple. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> seems to indicate that Reform and Conservative rabbis will not officiate either. What chance do we have of ingratiating an intermarried couple back into Judaism if we can&#8217;t participate in their wedding? I am not saying that we should ignore halacha, God forbid. I am only saying that we stack the deck against the intermarried couple that it becomes extremely difficult to include them in our communities. It is something that we need to work on and I think the Bermans are doing good work by trying to make orthodox Judaism more inclusive for intermarried couples.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. It&#8217;s worthwhile to read the book just to sense of the difficulties that intermarried couples encounter in their spiritual journeys. But more importantly, the book raises questions we must answer about how we handle intermarriage in the modern world. If you have read the book, I welcome your thoughts as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6895" alt="clip_image002" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/clip_image002-300x248.gif" width="300" height="248" />Professor Jack Wertheimer of the Jewish Theological Seminary (Conservative &#8211; not the Commentary Magazine kind, the Jewish kind) published a lengthy, <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-outreach-revolution/" target="_blank">thorough article on kiruv in the orthodox Jewish community</a>. It comes on the heels of two consecutive Klal Perspectives Journal issues on kiruv. He even quotes one article from KP.</p>
<p>First of all, Wertheimer gets kiruv and he gets the issues it creates. I commend him for writing an article as outsider while somehow grasping many of the nuances of kiruv in the orthodox Jewish world. It was very well done. I was impressed. That being said, he does make a few points that don&#8217;t pass the smell test.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the good observations. First, the article combines Chabad outreach and &#8220;everyone else&#8221;. I am not sure that makes sense. Chabad mostly functions independently of the rest of orthodox Judaism, especially in kiruv. Wertheimer comments that Chabad is sometimes viewed disparagingly by the non-Chabad orthodox Jews and even by the non-kiruv Chabad community. So while the numbers of of kiruv workers are staggering if one includes Chabad, it&#8217;s not so clear that they should be included in the same category as everyone else. Aside from the differences in perspective and allegiances, Chabad outreach is not always outreach, Wertheimer notes. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a service. Is a public service the same as kiruv? Maybe. But many non-Chabad people would say it is not.</p>
<p>The article proposes that the large number of kiruv workers is partially a result of more orthodox Jews who need jobs. This is true. For some people, kiruv is a paycheck. This might explain some of the diminished returns. The numbers in the 1990&#8242;s were higher than they are now. When it was a &#8220;calling&#8221; one could expect more success. Now it is just a job for a lot of people. That might make a difference.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about the article for me was that Wertheimer claims that in confidence non-Chabad kiruv workers told him that they consider it a success even if a prospect does not become orthodox.</p>
<p><span id="more-6894"></span></p>
<p>It is a success even if the prospect is more likely to attend a conservative or reform service. This surprised me. It does not reflect my experience. But while I concede that kiruv workers may be satisfied with that kind of return, their donors are not. Wertheimer notes that donors expect a greater return on their investment. &#8220;<em>Donors are increasingly linking their largesse to quotas: One funder insists that each campus outreach worker must reel in at least seven college students annually. Not surprisingly, these pressures have resulted in creative bookkeeping — and demoralization when unrealistic goals cannot be met.&#8221; </em> I alluded to this in my kiruv article as well. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/28/a-different-kiruv-paradigm/">A Different Kiruv Paradigm</a>)</p>
<p>Werheimer&#8217;s estimated numbers are staggering. He estimates that the &#8220;<em>collective impact of Orthodox outreach may touch between a half million and 700,000 Jews each year, rivaling the impact of the Conservative and Reform movements, and in the majority of cases complementing and enhancing the work of those important movements. </em>To think that we have that kind of influence among the other denominations is incredible.</p>
<p>He goes through some of the tension between orthodox kiruv workers and non-orthodox rabbis as well. One thing I had not thought of was the free Bar Mitzvah lessons and free admission to services on the High Holidays severely cutting into the bottom line of conservative and reform congregations. This is an area that needs to be addressed. We cannot cannibalize non-orthodox institutions.</p>
<p>Also mentioned is the questionable practices of using chicanery or smooth-talking to bait kiruv prospects. It&#8217;s deplorable and he could have spent even more time on it.</p>
<p>Further, the article notes that kiruv is not really a great match for today&#8217;s insular frum communities. He quotes the excellent article by Rabbi Ilan Feldman in Klal Perspectives. <em>“To effectively inspire people to become observant, the effort must be done in isolation from the established Orthodox community,” Rabbi Ilan Feldman laments. “Frum communities as cultures are simply not conducive to outreach.”</em> This is lamentable, but true. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/20/one-excellent-article-from-the-new-klal-perspectives-kiruv-issue/">One Excellent Article From Klal Perspectives Fall 2012 on Kiruv</a>)</p>
<p>The article concludes on a hopeful note. Wertheimer hopes that the ad hoc collaboration of kiruv with non-orthodox institutions can bolster American Jewry. <em>&#8220;The American Jewish community can rely upon a new resource to complement existing religious movements, synagogues, and educational institutions in their collective mission to inspire Jews of all ages to draw closer to their religious tradition.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>One thing that seemed improbable to me was the assertion that most kiruv success stories are formerly conservative Jews. My experience has been the complete opposite. That is, the <em>less </em>one knows about Judaism, the more likely one is to become frum. Conservative Jews are pretty educated and usually are passionate about their traditions. These are the people that are least likely to jump ship and go the orthodox route. Yet, for some reason Wertheimer asserts that they are the most likely. The entire article is devoid of footnotes. This is one area that the omission of footnotes is especially glaring. Perhaps Werhteimer&#8217;s conservative roots are coloring his perspective here.</p>
<p>But the most glaring issue to me was Wertheimer&#8217;s assumption that this is considered &#8220;working together&#8221;. He paints this whole thing as orthodox rabbis working <em>with </em>theconservative and reform movement. As if it&#8217;s some kind of partnership. I don&#8217;t agree. A partnership is where two groups work together. Kiruv can at best be viewed as supplementary. I think that calling it a partnership is a bit disingenuous at this point.</p>
<p>What are we to make of this article?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s remarkable that kiruv is such a huge industry that it is being written up in somewhat glowing terms by a conservative Jewish professor. The assumption has always been that kiruv is viewed as the enemy by non-orthodox Jews. It certainly did not feel that way reading Wertheimer&#8217;s article.</p>
<p>More importantly, an outsider who understands kiruv has some great advice. I think his criticisms must be considered.</p>
<p>But above all, I think we need to rethink the entire paradigm. We, as orthodox Jews, should be able to figure out a way to work together with the non-orthodox for real. Not just as supplements and not just as a safety net. We should be permitted and we should be able to partner in events and programs in which we share common goals. We should seek out such events and make them a priority. Wertheimer insinuates that orthodox Jews no longer view non-orthodox Jews as an enemy. This is only slightly true in some less insular quarters. But we can make it true for all orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, the war is over. No one is really deciding between orthodox Judaism and conservative or reform Judaism. Now the battle is all the denominations vs. secularism and apathy. We are on the same team now. It&#8217;s time to take kiruv to the next level and integrate with non-orthodox Jews for the sake of friendship and brotherhood. It can&#8217;t just be for the sake of kiruv. Those days are gone. Now it is time for real kiruv &#8211; closeness. A closeness for the pure sake of being close.</p>
<p>I think this article tells us that we can do just that. Now let&#8217;s do it.</p>

One of the people interviewed in the documentary was Professor Lawrence Schiffman. Some time later, this fellow mentioned something about &#8220;the conservative rabbi in the documentary&#8221;. I did not understand who he was talking about. Eventually we figured out that he was talking about Prof. Schiffman. Incredulous, I told this person that Prof. Schiffman is a very orthodox Jew and certainly not a conservative rabbi!</p>
<p>But I think I can understand why a run of the mill orthodox Jew would consider Prof. Schiffman conservative. It is on display in his recent, <a href="http://lawrenceschiffman.com/the-lord-is-one-reflections-on-the-history-of-judaism-in-light-of-the-shema-text-from-halbturn-austria/" target="_blank">magnificent blog post about an 1800 year old Golden Shema plate from Austria</a>. The article is really incredible in its scope and implication and I highly recommend reading it for several reasons.</p>
<p>The point I wish to focus our attention is the overall theme that Judaism has evolved, but not just from the time of the Mishna to now, it evolved from the time of entering the Land of Israel with Joshua to the time of the Mishna. Primarily, Prof. Schiffman suggests that monotheism in Judaism changed from a fuzzy version of One God with multiple Deity like figures to a more modern version of Monotheism where there is One God and no other power.</p>
<p>Things like magical spells are permissible using this original form of fuzzy monotheism, if done in the right way. Once the rabbis of the mishna modernized and canonized monotheism in a more rigid manner, &#8220;white&#8221; magic would be prohibited.<span id="more-6496"></span></p>
<p>To me, this also explains how in the origins of Christianity a Trinity was not so completely at odds with Judaism. There was an ancient Jewish tradition of fuzzy monotheism to draw from. The immediate reaction was to counter with rigid monotheism and then later on, the Mystics, according to Chacham Faur, reinvigorated some of the fuzzy monotheistic flavor back into Judaism.</p>
<p>But the overarching theme here is that things do change and Judaism does respond to social, political, and religious conditions. Whether is a conscious move or a subconcsious drift, Judaism is not a monolith and it never really has been.</p>
<p>As Prof. Schiffman concludes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This is Judaism as a historical phenomenon in ancient times.  To deny this diversity and to use the term “Judaisms” is also to deny its continuity and commonality and, hence, to deny its essence.  To deny its variegation is to turn it into a cult, in the modern sense of the term. To deny its often fuzzy boundaries is to deny its identity.</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But to state this today is to contradict the contemporary orthodox Jewish narrative. Saying these things implies something other than orthodox Judaism. It can lead an objective, honest, 2012 orthodox Jew to think that this is objectionable and only that for some reason only makes sense in the paradigm of conservative Judaism. That is a shame. Let us hope that we can broaden the spectrum just enough to be more honest about the evolution of Judaism. Let us try to ensure that there is a place, if not a primary one, for acknowledging Judaism&#8217;s capacity to change and at the same time be inclusive of many different shapes and forms even within orthodox Judaism.</p>
