				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the very least, Yom Kippur gives us a reason to put our lives on pause and evaluate how we are doing. Inevitably we&#8217;ve hurt some people along the way. Yom Kippur reminds us to make amends with those people who have been harmed by our insensitivity or malice. It&#8217;s obviously better to apologize and make peace than it is to allow the pain to fester and infect us long term.<span id="more-7626"></span></p>
<p>I am not a fan of digital requests for for forgiveness. They are impersonal and make it seem like one is trying to take a shortcut rather than the heartfelt apology that is deserved.<img class="alignright  wp-image-7627" alt="forgiveness-healing-heart" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/forgiveness-healing-heart-600x552.jpeg" width="420" height="386" /></p>
<p>However I do think that I need to make a digital request for forgiveness as well offer as an e-apology. Many people who read this blog or my thoughts on other digital platforms only know me through this medium. I don&#8217;t even know who many of you are. In fact the people who are probably most offended or hurt by things I have said are people that don&#8217;t even comment or &#8220;Like&#8221; posts on Facebook. They read, they get upset, and they are silent. Sometimes I get irate emails. I get it. I do appreciate the chance to have a dialogue. It is far better than when people just stay angry without seeking an explanation.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that I know for certain that I have hurt people by the things I have written. For that I sincerely apologize. I don&#8217;t intend to hurt anyone and I regret that anyone was insulted or incensed by what I have written.</p>
<p>I am sorry for anything and everything that made you upset or made you feel bad about something. I know it happens and I am truly sorry.</p>
<p>I beg your forgiveness. Let&#8217;s go into Yom Kippur with a clean slate. All of us deserve the opportunity to pass through judgment by the Almighty free of the shackles interpersonal disputes place on us. We enter Yom Kippur with unity and one love.</p>
<p>As for all of you readers who may think you need to ask me forgiveness, you don&#8217;t. No one does. I don&#8217;t bear any grudges. I don&#8217;t take offense to anything you&#8217;ve written or said about me. I probably deserved it anyway. And even if I didn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s cool. Don&#8217;t worry.</p>
<p>I wish everyone a beautiful Yom Kippur. My favorite day of the year at Pacific Jewish Center is Yom Kippur. If you&#8217;d like to find out why, I invite you to join us either this year or sometime in the future. Wherever you are, I hope the day lives up to its lofty potential for you.</p>
<p><em>May we all be inscribed in the Book of Life.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another Yom Kippur is upon us. I remember talking with my 10th grade rebbe R&#8217; Kalman Weinreb outside the High School Beis Medrash on Erev Yom Kippur 5757. I was complaining about how hard the fast was for me. I suggested that it would be easier to pray and repent if I could just eat and drink a little. Not a lot, just a little. He empathized with my 15 year old sensibilities but explained to me how the complete immersion in spiritual pursuits requires complete immersion not almost complete immersion. He said it would be worth it. All good things are worth the difficult path we must take to arrive at our desired destination. R&#8217; Kalman was about to wrap up our conversation and then he looked at me with a gleam in his eye and told me that the fast gets easier every year. That was it. He walked away.<span id="more-7622"></span></p>
<p>My 15 year old self thought it was great news that the fast was going to get easier every year. Something to look forward to.<img class="alignright  wp-image-7623" alt="Kol_nidre_in_the_machzor_of_Worms" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Kol_nidre_in_the_machzor_of_Worms-508x600.jpg" width="305" height="360" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s true. The fast does get easier every year. This is my sixth Yom Kippur in an official capacity at Pacific Jewish Center. The first year I led the services for Kol Nidre, Maariv, and Neilah. I also spoke 4 times. I thought that I could not possibly do any more. Four years ago I started doing Mussaf as well. Indeed, it does get easier every year.</p>
<p>My 32 year old self does not agree with my 15 year old self. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good that the fast gets easier every year. The easier the fast becomes, the harder it is to truly experience the dread and discomfort that help make the day so powerful. I am not suggesting that we make it extra hard on ourselves. We take the day as it comes. But I think something is lost as we grow older. Our idealism may fade a bit. Our imagination is a little less active. Our dreams are not quite as vivid. We don&#8217;t feel things the way we did when we were younger. That&#8217;s why it gets easier.</p>
<p>While that may make surviving Yom Kippur less of a challenge, it can make living the day more challenging. It&#8217;s a new challenge every year. The hardest part of the challenge is being aware that it is there. I&#8217;ve only recently realized that this is something I need to work on for my own Yom Kippur experience.</p>
<p>The challenge is different. But we are certainly up to the challenge. Instead of struggling to pray while we feel ragged and tired we must struggle to feel ragged and tired as we breeze through the prayers.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The goal of Yom Kippur is not to get through the day. Rather the goal is for the day of Yom Kippur to go through us.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Its unique blend of spirituality should be coursing through our veins by the end of the day. After all, it&#8217;s the only thing we&#8217;ve put into ourselves for 25 hours.</p>
<p>If we succeed, and I am confident we will, we will realize the full magnitude of the gains to had on Yom Kippur no matter where we are in life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RH-2012-Card.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6214" title="RH 2012 Card" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RH-2012-Card-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>In what has become a bit of a custom for me, I took to the Venice Boardwalk on Sunday to wish everyone a sweet new year. As usual, I met some very interesting and wonderful people through the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Many people stopped by to dip the apple in the honey which is not as easy as it looks with the nice ocean breeze wreaking havoc with honey drips. Some stepped into the shul for a few moments and we had some lovely conversations. Everyone got free apples and honey and an open invitation to join us at the Shul on the Beach for High Holidays services.</p>
<p>Of all the people that stopped by, three were of particular interest.<span id="more-6213"></span></p>
<p>One guy was an Iranian Muslim. He said his father was very religious and used to pray his morning services for three hours. It only takes a few minutes for most people, but his father was so pious that it took him hours. Then he told me the entire story of Muhammad. He said his father had great respect for Jewish people and used to study the Torah. This fellow is not Muslim. He claims he is &#8220;everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then there was the film student from Boston. She recently came to LA as part of a program with Boston University. Earlier that day her mother was guilting her about where she was going to go to hear the Shofar on Rosh Hashanah. So she told her mom she didn&#8217;t know yet, but she was definitely going to services &#8220;on the beach&#8221;. She had never even heard of shul but when she saw the shul she said it was &#8220;<em>beshert</em>&#8220;! Now she is planning on joining us for services. Her mother will be happy.</p>
<p>My third encounter was with an Intactvist across the way. He gets his own post. Tune in tomorrow for my conversation with the Venice Boardwalk Intactivist.</p>
<p>The High Holidays are a magical time everywhere. But at The Shul on the Beach they are particularly inspiring. Jews from every walk of life, with every level of observance, and of every background join together for services. Everyone is welcome and everyone is made to feel welcome. We invite you to join us.</p>
<p><strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> is September 16 at sundown through nightfall on September 18. Shofar blowing at The Shul on the Beach will be around 11 AM on September 17 and 18.</p>
<p><strong>Yom Kippur</strong> is September 25 at sundown for K0l Nidre through nightfall on September 26.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to join us for services whether for the entire thing or just a few moments. If you want a seat with your name on it, call or email the PJC office at info@pjcenter.com.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/KolNidre.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4705" title="KolNidre" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/KolNidre-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>Tonight is Yom Kippur. Across the world, millions of Jews will usher in the solemn day of Yom Kippur with the ancient prayer of Kol Nidre.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more strange.</p>
<p>Yom Kippur is the day of repentance. Kol Nidre is a prayer that annuls our vows. That is a very unlikely way to begin Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>Yet, not only do we begin Yom Kippur with Kol Nidre we tremble when the familiar tune is chanted. Then, we end the prayer with ונסלח לכל עדת בני ישראל כי לכל העם בשגגה. &#8220;And all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven&#8221;.</p>
<p>Why do we begin Yom Kippur with Kol Nidre and what relationship is there between the Kol Nidre prayer annulling our vows and the statement of ask for forgiveness for the congregation of Israel?<span id="more-4700"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://baltimorejewishlife.com/news/news-detail.php?SECTION_ID=1&amp;ARTICLE_ID=9918" target="_blank">Says Rabbi Frand</a>:</p>
<p>Throughout the year, many of us take on additional practices to enhance our observance. We may be stringent in various matters to protect ourselves from sin. It is possible even that we would disassociate ourselves from others as a result of our personal stringencies. It is possible we could feel an air of superiority for keeping these practices.</p>
<p>These additional practices have the status of a vow.</p>
<p>Kol Nidre annuls these vows.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to stand before God Almighty and beg for forgiveness would we be individuals at odds with our brothers and sisters. If we separate ourselves with these stringencies we stand divided before God.</p>
<p>Kol Nidre levels the playing field. All those stringencies are removed by the Kol Nidre prayer. One is free to re-initiate them after Yom Kippur. But on Yom Kippur we stand united. No personal preferences, stringencies and personal practices stand between us. Therefore, we conclude Kol Nidre with ונסלח לכל עדת בני ישראל כי לכל העם בשגגה. The <em>entire congregation</em> can stand before God as one. We can come to God to ask for forgiveness strengthened by our unity once we get rid of whatever minor practices we may have that can divide us.</p>
<p>The key is to come together. The key is unity.</p>
<p>I mentioned in a previous post [see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/10/04/making-the-post-yom-kippur-meal-meaningful/">Making The Post Yom Kippur Meal Meaningful</a>] that there is no Jewish observance that is more universal than fasting and coming to The Shul on the Beach Yom Kippur. Everyone [almost] does it. Aside from the beauty that we can find in our unity, it is the ultimate tool in our hands as we ask the Almighty to forgive us.</p>
<p>Let us enter this day with unity, leave it with unity as well but most importantly maintain that unity for the future.</p>

<p>The song is The Bird of Hope, the singer is Mordechai ben David.</p>
<p>For me, this song has always been a powerful metaphor for Yom Kippur. I really wanted to share it with you but it was not available anywhere online. So I decided to do it myself. I made this video <del>yesterday</del> last year. The pictures don&#8217;t do the lyrics justice, but it was worth making the video so everyone could hear the song before Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>Please watch the video and contemplate its important message.<span id="more-4695"></span></p>
<p>No matter where how drastically we fall, we can always rise from the ashes to great heights. We just need to make the right choices.</p>
<p>On a side note, this song was recorded in 1979. Mordechai ben David&#8217;s voice is so incredible in this song. It&#8217;s amazing that he is still recording new songs, but after listening to this, you will note that he a shadow of his former self&#8230;</p>
<p>I want to wish everyone a successful Yom Kippur. <em>Please forgive everyone who may have harmed you</em>. I know I have.</p>
<p>Please share this video to help everyone prepare for Yom Kippur.</p>

I think it is worth reposting for this year&#8217;s &#8220;10 Days of Repentance&#8221;.</strong></em></p>
<p>As we approach the Jewish New Year there is an effort  to at least attempt to enter Rosh Hashanah clean from sin. Unfortunately, we have made bad choices, we have done wrong in our lives. How are we to start a fresh year with joy and confidence if we are carrying all the baggage of mistakes we have made. It can be depressing thinking about bad choices we have made. They all have consequences and we may regret what we have done. But regret does not fix the harms we have caused. Regret can have a debilitating effect if it holds us back from achieving our goals as we wallow in self pity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a concept of Teshuva, repentance, in Judaism. The word repentance generally refers to a person to has decided to commit their life to God (see Wikipedia on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentance" target="_blank">repentance</a>). But what of someone who already has committed their life to God and is trying to do their best to make the best moral choices in their life but has made mistakes? Is there a mechanism for that person to somehow come back to God? Aren&#8217;t they already committed to God? What more can they do?</p>
<p>In Judaism there is such a mechanism. <span id="more-4685"></span>That is what we call Teshuva. Anyone can do teshuva and everyone should be doing teshuva all the time. Any time we make the wrong choice we have created separation between ourselves and God who is Perfection. Our lack of perfection stands in the way of being with God and Perfection. The further we are from perfection, the further we are from God. Teshuva gets us closer to perfection.</p>
<p>But how? Once we have acted and done wrong the deed is done. Can teshuva make it disappear? Is it magic?</p>
<p>Compounding the problem is the idea that God is the Ultimate Judge. That means that if an act is &#8220;bad&#8221; it deserves immediate consequences. There is no judge, no jury, no lawyers, no plea bargain deals, Ultimate Judgment means that every act has an exact and precise Divine Reaction. That is how the physical world works as well. If ones steals something, the item is stolen immediately. There is no grace period or gray area. If one kills someone, the person is dead. If one cheats on their wife, they have cheated. In the physical world, our actions have immediate, real reactions. That is what is meant by &#8220;judgment&#8221; (poor translation of the hebrew word din). There is an immediate reaction to our actions from God as well. The distance created by our lack of perfection is instantaneous. How do we repent from acts that are done? If someone is dead because of our action, no amount of sorrow or regret will bring the person back. Same with infidelity. How can teshuva fix the immediate reactions of our actions?</p>
<p>This leaves us with an additional question: While it is true that God acts with judgment, God also acts with mercy (rachamim) how does mercy reconcile with judgment if judgment means that every action has an immediate physical and spiritual reaction?</p>
<p>The Ramchal in Mesillas Yesharim provides a wonderful explanation. First, he explains that the mercy of God is that while every action does have an immediate spiritual consequence, that consequence can be suspended for a period of time giving the person time to repent.</p>
<p>But what of the repentance? How does that work? He says that every action really has two parts. The first part is the formation of intent. The idea and the desire to act are the first part of every action. Then we act; that is the second part. The action causes the immediate result. Physical and spiritual. Each action is &#8220;owned&#8221; by its actor. So when one makes a wrong choice the act is connected to them. The action is the end of a chain that hooks up to the actor. The hook on the end of the chain that is connected to the actor is the desire for the result. So a flow chart would look like this:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Actor&#8212;-&gt;Desire&#8212;-&gt;Action&#8212;-&gt;Result.</h3>
<p>The result is only connected to the actor through the desire. Teshuva is the process of &#8220;undoing&#8221; the desire for the action and its result. True repentance occurs when the actor wishes with all their heart that they had never acted the way they did. When the person truly regrets their choice the desire part of the action can be unhooked from the actor! If there is no hook connectig the action to the actor (the desire) then the actor and the action are no longer associated with one another. That is teshuva. Repentance is disassociating the action from the actor by removing the desire to act. Of course, in order for the desire to be disassociated from the actor the actor must everything in their power to fix the horrible results of their action. But once that is done, repentance can be achieved and the action can be clipped away from the actor.</p>
<p>Certainly, the deed is done. What&#8217;s done is done. We cannot change the past. But we can change our association with the past.</p>
<p>This kind of repentance leaves no room for baggage and guilt. It is a clean break from the past and allows us to move forward to a future of better choices.</p>
<p>It is the perfect way to begin a new year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/225px-Gottlieb-Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4682" title="225px-Gottlieb-Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/225px-Gottlieb-Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="291" /></a>Although many Jews celebrate Pesach and Chanukah, anecdotally, I think the most universal Jewish tradition is Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>Back when I was a campus rabbi at USC, even the most unaffiliated students would fast. One year, many of my students attended the USC Trojans football game in Palo Alto against Stanford on Yom Kippur. Almost all of them fasted.</p>
<p>At the Shul on the Beach, we are bursting at the seams on Yom Kippur. At least 20 minutes before Kol Nidre every seat is full. As the shofar blasts signaling the end of the holiest day of the year, there is standing room only. Every square inch of the shul is occupied by our Jewish brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Indeed, Yom Kippur brings all Jews together. I think it brings us together even more than Chanukah and Pesach because there is only one way to do Yom Kippur, at least externally. We all fast and we all come to shul. The sense of unity and camaraderie is inspiring. On other holidays, the traditions have become more fractured and diverse. Different communities, religious denominations and families celebrate so differently.</p>
<p>On Yom Kippur the observances are much more uniform. I believe Yom Kippur is the most universal Jewish tradition.</p>
<p>Where traditions veer off onto their own is the post fast meal.<span id="more-4681"></span></p>
<p>For some, the solemnity of the day carries over into the post fast meal. For others, the sheer physical toll makes the meal less of a meal and more of a struggle to restore some of their sapped energy. For others, it becomes a bit of a party and celebration; a time to socialize and connect on a personal level. My family&#8217;s tradition is to break the fast with a festive meal that is almost like a Yom Tov meal.</p>
<p>The NY Times chronicles some of these traditions in a recent article. One tradition that is gaining traction is non-orthodox circles is a post fast community or group meal.</p>
<p>I think it is important to realize that the post fast meal has great potential for growth and accomplishment as we begin anew post our Yom Kippur penance. Wasting the opportunity seems like a shame.</p>
<p>It seems that it is easy to dismiss the post Yom Kippur meal as a newfangled (read: negative) experience. A social gathering has potential for undesirable levity and frivolity. This would be disappointing after an inspiring day of spirituality. But if done the right way, I think there is merit to post fast meal.</p>
<p>Upon the completion of a powerful group experience of fasting and praying together, we can tap into the energy of those moments and use them to our advantage as relationship building experiences. I know that whenever I been part of a shared experience that has impacted the group, we connect and share a common bond that carries tremendous weight. Using the post fast moments to unite and connect with one another could be a very meaningful experience.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of many better ways to spend the nirvana-like moments after Yom Kippur.</p>

<p>For hundreds of years, rabbis have been trying to ban kaparos. The Rashba, the Ramban, the Bais Yosef and more recently, the Aruch Hashulchan all wanted to ban kaparos. Some did, and no one listened, others did not because they knew no one would listen.</p>
<p>Classically, the primary halachic objections to kaparos are the issue of &#8220;darkei Emori&#8221; (pagan ritual) and the likelihood of flawed shechita due to the high volume of chickens being shechted in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Kaparos lives on. In fact kaparos with chickens has only increased in popularity in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I think it is time to end the kaparos with chickens custom. Here is why:<span id="more-4678"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Many smart rabbis have tried to ban the practice already. (see above for the two primary reasons &#8211; pagan / bad shechita)</li>
<li>When the great rabbis of yore try to ban a practice and the PEOPLE are persistent&#8230; I am suspicious.</li>
<li>The &#8220;reasons&#8221; given to justify kaparos are purely kabbalistic and have no other source in nigleh.</li>
<li>It appears like magic.</li>
<li>Saying the formula of &#8220;zeh tmurasi&#8221; while holding an animal is an activity that is dangerously close to acting as if the chicken is a korban. That is assur.</li>
<li>Money is just as &#8220;effective&#8221;.</li>
<li>The treatment of the animals before, after and during is often tzaar baalei chaim. Chickens were found wandering the streets of Brooklyn one year after a rain forced the organizers indoors and the chickens were neglected. The unlucky chickens drowned in their cages.</li>
<li>The HUGE chillul Hashem that has occurred in many locations over the last few years. Chickens dying from dehydration, feces and feathers on the street for days after Yom Kippur and other health violations as well.</li>
<li>It looks pagan. Thus it makes Orthodox Judaism look pagan in the eyes of others. This might also qualify as a chillul Hashem.</li>
<li>A diyuk in the Aruch Hashulchan (605:4).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do we need a diyuk? Because some people don&#8217;t use common sense (1-8) unless there is a &#8220;source&#8221; in a relied upon halachic decisor. So for them&#8230;</p>
<p>Here is the diyuk:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;(Use the chicken that you use for kaparos for your erev Yom Kippur meal or to provide a meal for a poor person.) One is not permitted to search for a WHITE chicken to use for kaparos. This is avoda zara. Whatever one has on hand is what they should use for kaparos.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I think it is fair to say that the Aruch Hashulchan is saying that people were shechting a chicken for the seudah anyway (the same way they would if they would shecht a chicken for any festive meal), they were using a chicken from the backyard. Everyone had chickens that they would use for eggs and eventually for meat, if they wanted to use one of those chickens for kaparos it was okay. However, it was not permissible to seek out a specific chicken (like a white chicken). One was only supposed to use what was on hand.</p>
<p>I think it is likely that the Aruch Hashulchan would prohibit using ANY chickens today when we are ALL seeking a specific chicken as none of us have chickens on hand. The idea was that if you were already shechting a chicken you could add some extra meaning to the procedure by contemplating the irony of the situation. As you were heading to judgment, you were killing a chicken. But for us, who never touch chickens (unless we are shlugging kaparos) are in effect doing just what the Aruch Hashulchan prohibits &#8211; seeking after a chicken for kaparos.</p>

Rosh Hashanah was two weeks and ago and Yom Kippur was this past weekend.</p>
<p>I noticed something that almost all Jewish Twitter users must have noticed as the Holidays drew nearer. Google and Yahoo Search track the most popular searches for any given time period. There is much social commentary and benefit to observing what the most popular trends on Google and Yahoo.</p>
<p>Similarly, Twitter tracks the most popular terms found in Twitter Updates (not searches). This is perhaps even more telling as it tracks what people are writing about as opposed to what they are curious about.<span id="more-2873"></span></p>
<p>The Twitter Home Page (before login) has a scrolling account of the hottest Twitter trends.</p>
<p>On the eve of Rosh Hashanah the number one trending topic was Shana Tova (Hebrew for &#8211; Have a Good Year). On the eve of Yom Kippur the top trending topic was Yom Kippur. These were worldside trends; not local trends for New York or Los Angeles (very Jewish cities).</p>
<p>I find it incredible that a miniscule population of Jewish people can have such an impact on the Twitter Trends. It is also remarkable that although the vast majority of Jewish people are not very religious, these Holy Days still carry significance for so many.</p>

<p><em>Some readers of this blog will not understand every word. Read it anyway &#8211; it carries universal messages. My Father in Law was raised in a traditional Jewish home, not a very religious home like the religious home in which he raised his children. He went back to the synagogue of his youth for Yom Kippur this year.</em></p>
<p><em>His experience was inspiring and the account of his experience is beautiful and important.</em></p>
<p>I recently spoke at a High School orientation and urged the students to &#8220;Listen to your messages&#8221; especially during the Yom Noraim (the high holiday period). So when a random text message arrived on my BlackBerry with the following message: &#8220;A Few Men needed to help ensure a Minyan in Fall River Massachusetts&#8221;, I was eager to respond.<span id="more-2861"></span> While I live in the culturally rich community of Monsey, New York with three Shuls on my block and almost 60 Jewish Schools, I was born and raised in Fall River. When I was growing up in the 1950&#8242;s and 60&#8242;s there were around 3000 Jews out of a population of close to 100,000 people. Today the Jewish Community has dwindled dramatically through outmigration, assimilation, and aging.</p>
<p>For me, this was a unique opportunity to give back to my community in some small way and to help the shul that helped me and shaped much of my personal history. In this shul, I first learned &#8220;Alef Bais&#8221; and Mishnayos, (with Rabbi Lipschutz and Chazan Schneider) and even delivered my first complete Haftorah (which ironically enough was Maftir Yonah &#8211; which I chanted again on this Yom Kippur). More than these &#8220;activities&#8221;, the Adas Israel Shul gave me memories: memories of my zaydie and bubby whose  hybrid European and American cultures provided me with a glimpse and a small anchor back to the old country (Belarus circa 1910). It gave me memories of the years I attended services on Erev Pesach with my uncle with whom I shared the distinct merit of being a &#8220;first born son&#8221;; the memory of pleasantly surprising my parents on one Neilah afternoon by making certain that despite the fact that I was a &#8220;1960&#8242;s college student&#8221; I was not going to  forsake the precious moment when G-d opened up the gates of repentance; and my Aufruf  held in the very same Shul &#8211; more than 36 years ago.</p>
<p>These thoughts raced through me as I headed North from New York to Providence on Route 95, and then 20 miles East over the bridge to Fall River on Route 195.</p>
<p>I was also motivated to go because I had recently learned that the Shul was up for sale. After all, how could the 70 remaining members, most of whom were in their 80&#8242;s maintain the synagogue. Minyanim were harder and harder to come by even on Shabbosim. Even on Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur. I felt as Avrohom Fried sings about Moshiach, &#8220;Now&#8217;s the Time&#8221;.</p>
<p>I spent 26 magical hours in the shul. In fact, from 6:00 PM Erev Yom Kippur until after Shofar blowing, at 8:15 PM the next evening, I remained inside the building. I even slept in the shul on an air mattress which the visiting chazan had brought from New Jersey.</p>
<p>I had  five significant reactions during my experience.</p>
<p><strong>Gratitude</strong>: I most profoundly felt gratitude and humility that the Kadosh Baruch Hu had provided me with a &#8220;GPS which recalculated my direction&#8221; and put my family and me on the right roads. After all, the five little Peppers had all grown up here in Fall River and today, Baruch Hashem each of us have families (spouses, children, and grandchildren) who are fully committed frum Jews.</p>
<p><strong>Sadness</strong>: As I entered the sanctuary I had a visceral reaction to the brightness. The shul was lit up. There were 1155 names on the nine memorial plaques which illuminated the shul. Yet there were just 16 men and less than 20 women at the height of attendance on Yom Kippur. I thought and actually hummed the following:</p>
<p><em>Where have all the children gone long time passing?<br />
Where have all the  yidden gone long time ago?<br />
Gone to places everywhere but most about their Judaism they are unaware?<br />
When will they ever learn? How can they can they recognize that they must learn</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Family Pride</strong>: Of the 30 people present, about one third were family members. While these children and offspring of my Uncle Zack had only received the same rudimentary Hebrew school education that most young people in New England get (as did I), these cousins have worked tirelessly to keep the shul alive and to breath a little Jewish life into the community. I felt the concept of the Pintele Yid in action.</p>
<p><strong>Confused</strong>: In Monsey and in other well developed communities, Jews have labels for each other: FFB, BT, ashkenazi and sepharedi, Litvish and chasidish, Frum, Frei, the list goes on. In Fall  River there we no labels. Just the Jewish children, of Avraham, Yitzchok ,and Yaakov. While  not technically very religious or observant, these Jews showed reverence during the service. They didn&#8217;t talk during prayers and stood throughout neila as the  holy ark was opened.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibility</strong>: The Yom Kippur experience gave me a renewed sense of Jewish Ownership: the world was created for me and that which I do matters. I chanted along with the chain, conversed with everyone during the breaks, and felt that my tefillos and  those of my Fall River brothers and sisters were inextricably connected.</p>
<p>This was a most profound Yom Tov for me, one which allowed me to remember the past, live the present, and trust the future. I felt a connection from generation to generation and I felt the renewed sense of responsibility that all Jews are  responsible for one another and that indeed we are one people with a single destiny.</p>
<p>Am Yisroel Chai.</p>

<p>For me, this song has always been a powerful metaphor for Yom Kippur. I really wanted to share it with you but it was not available anywhere online. So I decided to do it myself. I made this video yesterday. The pictures don&#8217;t do the lyrics justice, but it was worth making the video so everyone could hear the song before Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>Please watch the video and contemplate its important message.<span id="more-2848"></span></p>
<p>No matter where how drastically we fall, we can always rise from the ashes to great heights. We just need to make the right choices.</p>
<p>On a side note, this song was recorded in 1979. Mordechai ben David&#8217;s voice is so incredible in this song. It&#8217;s amazing that he is still recording new songs, but after listening to this, you will note that he a shadow of his former self&#8230;</p>
<p>I want to wish everyone a successful Yom Kippur. <em>Please forgive everyone who may have harmed you</em>. I know I have.</p>
<p>Please share this video to help everyone prepare for Yom Kippur.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1043" title="Giants Stadium" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Giants-Stadium-1-300x214.jpg" alt="Giants Stadium" width="300" height="214" />A few months ago, the New York Jets football team <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2009/04/15/2009-04-15_jewish_fans_jolt_jets_nfl.html" target="_blank">made headlines </a>when they moved they 4 PM Sunday game on Erev (the day before) Yom Kippur to 1 PM. This time change would give Jewish people wishing to observe Yom Kippur the opportunity to be home before the start of Yom Kippur at sundown on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>This was a nice gesture. It was also, completely unnecessary as Jews are comfortable with and used to compromising to satisfy their Religious beliefs. Jews who keep kosher often cannot eat at business lunches and Shabbos observant Jews miss live college football every Saturday in the fall. Missing a Jets game the day before Yom Kippur is not that big a deal. Plus, it is like a badge of courage to miss an event for your religion. Just ask <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Koufax.html" target="_blank">Sandy Koufax</a>. Missing the game is not that big a deal. Yet, the change was made.</p>
<p>Now it seems that this decision by the Jets is causing a bit of a problem.</p>
<p><span id="more-1042"></span><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/its-a-mitzvah-u2-reschedules-concert-because-of-jets-game-and-jewish-holiday/" target="_blank">NY Times Arts Beat Blog</a> is reporting that this minor schedule change by the Jets is affecting thousands of people. The award winning band, U2 had scheduled a concert in the same stadium the Jets use (ironically, called Giants Stadium) for the Friday before Yom Kippur. Thousands of fans made travel plans, inlcuding flights and hotels ot make thier U2 pilgrimage and see the band&#8217;s live show. That Friday night show has been canceled and moved two days earlier to Wednesday. According to U2&#8242;s piblicist, the change was needed to make the show logistically possible, due to the now earlier Jets game, they were concerned that the field would not be ready for the Jets on Sunday.</p>
<p>As U2 lead singer and social activist, Bono, croons in &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCzccXAF8Lo" target="_blank">City of Blinding Lights</a>&#8220;,<em> blessing&#8217;s not just for the ones who kneel, luckily. </em>Meaning, all prayers are valuable, not just the &#8220;kneelers&#8221; (I assume <em>&#8220;ones who kneel&#8221;</em> means Christians for whom the kneel is a contemporary prayer pose). So, Bono is just respecting the Jews right? Maybe.</p>
<p>But, there is an elephant in the room. Thousands of U2 fans are being inconvenienced. Thousands of U2 fans are going to need to make alternate travel plans and will lose money because of this change in schedule.</p>
<p>That is not fair. It may even be grounds for a law suit. Who knows? Ask your local lawyer for some insight into promissory estoppel and breach of contract.</p>
<p>More importantly, for people like me this has spawned an outrage from U2 fans and others on the NY Time Arts Beats Blog and I am sure other places as well. Now I get to read Jew friendly comments like <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/its-a-mitzvah-u2-reschedules-concert-because-of-jets-game-and-jewish-holiday/#comment-122223" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/its-a-mitzvah-u2-reschedules-concert-because-of-jets-game-and-jewish-holiday/#comment-122229" target="_blank">this</a> from rightfully angry fans.</p>
<p>Disturbing as well, is the headline for the blog post on NY Times: It&#8217;s a Mitzvah&#8221;, insinuating that changing the concert date is a good deed. I disagree. It is not a mitzvah to cause financial harm to innocent U2 fans.</p>
<p>There is one more thing that nags at me about all this. The Jets made their change months ago. U2 knew about the change months ago. Changing the date now may be necessary but it should have been done at the time the Jets made their schedule change. By not making the change and then crossing their fans by changing the date after fans have already made plans and then &#8220;blaming&#8221; it on a Jewish holiday (it says in the <a href="http://www.u2.com/news/title/scheduling-change-for-giants-stadium-performance" target="_blank">press release</a> &#8220;out of respect for the Jewish faith&#8221;) gives Jew haters (<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090826213103AA4oUA7" target="_blank">like this guy</a>) the opening they need to spew their venom. That is just not right.</p>
<p>Take the blame yourself. Don&#8217;t blame it on us. That is certainly not a mitzvah.</p>
