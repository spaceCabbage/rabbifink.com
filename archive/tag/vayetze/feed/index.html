				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JudahEmblem.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6521" title="JudahEmblem" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JudahEmblem.png" alt="" width="150" height="214" /></a>In what has become a familiar refrain, the Torah Temimah in Parshas Vayetze takes the most expansive position available with regard to women prophetesses.</p>
<p>In Vayetze, Leah and Yaakov have a bunch of children who eventually become half of the tribes of Israel. In naming her fourth son, Leah decides to thank God &#8220;this time&#8221;. The commentaries wonder why Leah is thanking God &#8220;this time&#8221;. Rashi explains that she was giving thanks for taking &#8220;more than her portion&#8221;. The idea is that there were four women who were the mothers of the tribes to be and there were to be 12 tribes. If each mother got her equal share they would each bear three sons. Leah was now on her fourth so she realized she was getting &#8220;more than she thought she was getting&#8221;. For this she thanked God.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah tells us that Rashi is quoting a Midrash Raba and that Leah knew this information because she saw it with <em>ruach hakodesh. </em>He then quotes a Maharsha that says that this cannot be a prophecy because Leah is not included in the list of twelve prophetesses in the first chapter of (Babylonian Talmud) Megillah 14A. Rather she made this proclamation with no intent and God placed it in her lips to speak of the future. The Torah Temimah remarks that this is very hard pill to swallow.<span id="more-6520"></span></p>
<p>So instead, the Torah Temimah says, and there is no need to quote him here so I will paraphrase, that all the matriarchs were prophetesses. He uses a Midrash Socher Tov to support this assertion as that Midrash makes a drasha to make the same point. He goes on to say that there are competing opinions among the rabbinic commentators and there are sources on each side of the debate. Therefore, one cannot ask from one source to the other.</p>
<p>Nothing too groundbreaking here, but the overall point is that once again the Torah Temimah is trying his best to include women as potential prophetesses. And for that we thank him.</p>
<p>Also, I think it is clear from the Maharsha and the Torah Temimah that <em>ruach hakodesh </em>would be considered prophecy. I am pretty sure this is the opinion of Maimonides. What&#8217;s interesting, is that it seems that one cannot posses <em>ruach hakodesh </em> unless one is a candidate for prophecy. Are there any opinions who claim authentic prophecy is possible today? Can we authoritatively rule out<em> ruach hakodesh</em> as well? At least according to this Maharsha? I think so.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayetze<br />
The Ropes That Pull Us Together</h2>
<p>As we begin to see the emergence of Yaakov Avinu as the father of the <em>shivtei ka </em>we cannot help but notice the many nuanced messages and symbolism the Torah shares with us. One such <em>yesod</em> is found in the encounter of Yitzchok Avinu at the famous well outside of Charan.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that Yaakov Avinu arrived at Charan after his harrowing journey in flight from his brother. As he arrived he finds himself at the <em>be’er basadeh</em>. There the famous tale of his encounter with Rochel Imeinu is recorded. Chazal wonder what is to be learned from the fact that it is a <em>be’er basadeh</em>, a well in the field, which defines Yaakov Avinu’s arrival into <em>golus</em>.</p>
<p>Midrashim are filled with symbolic messages explaining the representations of this <em>be’er</em>, the <em>edrei tzon</em> and the large stone which sealed and provided access to the water source of the community. The Malbim provides us a most meaningful <em>mehalach </em>so relevant to us today.<span id="more-6505"></span></p>
<p>In his approach the Malbim explains that the<em> be’er </em>represents the <em>mekor mayim chayim</em>. It reflects the<em> hashpaas</em> Hashem, His goodness and bountiful blessings that give us the proverbial hug from the Borei Olam. In a word, the Be’er represents the Shechina and how it fills our lives with all of His blessings. The symbolism is powerful.</p>
<p>The Malbim points out that as Yaakov was now in <em>golus</em> the Shechina came with him, indeed the <em>be’er</em> was <em>basadeh</em>, in the field outside of Eretz Yisrael. However, when Klal Yisrael is living in their homeland with the close access to the Shechina the Bais Hamikdash provides we will find the <em>be’er bisoch ha’er</em>, in the very heart of the city. Nevertheless, while residing in <em>golus </em>it is our vital task to bring that <em>be’er</em> and the spiritual nourishment it represents from the <em>sadeh</em> into our home.</p>
<p>Just how does one bring the sanctity and warmth of the <em>be’er</em> into their home? The Malbim again draws on the words of Chazal and teaches that Reb Yehoshua taught his students that the way to harness the power of the <em>be’er</em> and pull it from the <em>sadeh</em> into the city is by fashioning <em>chavalim min hasubim</em> and through that be <em>machzeer Shechinaso leTziyon</em>. Strands braided from the leftover and unwanted fibers can be spun and twisted into powerful ropes, attached to the well and used to <em>shlep</em> it into the heart of the city. The ropes the Malbim describes represent the spinning and twisting together of Klal Yisrael from many fragments (even discarded ones) into one cord of strength as Yidden from all walks of life come together to accomplish the seemingly impossible.</p>
<p>The message is clear. If we want to bring the Shechina into our city, our community and our home we need strong ropes of <em>achdus</em> to pull together and bring the <em>be’er </em>closer and provide us the spiritual refreshment the <em>hashpaas haShechina </em>bestows. Only through <em>achdus</em> can we truly fare well.</p>
<p>This is no small feat.</p>
<p>Too often we stand apart rather then building on what we have in common. However, we must find a way to wrap ourselves around our common heartfelt <em>emuna</em> and the inner goodness of each Jew to braid a cord of unity and strength with which to connect to the Shechina and bring it home. This, Chazal teach us, is the formula for extricating ourselves from the morass of <em>golus</em>. It is not enough to seek spirituality. We must pull it inward. We cannot do it ourselves &#8211; we need every fiber of Jewry to pull together as one strong cord of strength. By doing so we can hope to fill our lives with His love and bring the <em>be’er </em>into our homes and thereby bring our homes to the ultimate <em>mikor</em> of <em>kedusha</em> in Yerushalayim Ir Hakodesh<br />
<em>bimheira biyameinu</em>.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayeitzei</h2>
<h2>Vayishma Yaakov!</h2>
<p>After more than 20 years in Lavan’s home, Yaakov Avinu overhears his cousins, (Lavan’s children) speaking despairingly of him. We are told “Vayar Yaakov es pnei Lavan v’henei ainenu emanu imo kismol shilshom” &#8211; and Yaakov saw that Lavan’s face wasn’t the same as it was the day before. What was it that Yaakov saw? In truth, upon learning of his true standing in the house of Lavan, Yaakov introspected. He reexamined his relationship with his uncle and realized it was one sided. He reassessed his life in Golus away from Eretz Yisrael and away from his parents. He realized he didn’t really belong. Something was amiss. Hashem Yisborach had not spoken with him for over twenty years. It was time for a change.<span id="more-3283"></span></p>
<p>Comes the next Posuk: “Vayomer Hashem El Yaakov Shuv El Eretz Avosecha Ul’moladtecha” &#8211; Hashem says to Yaakov, “Return to the land of your fathers and your birthright”. What happened? Why is it that Hashem Yisborach finally speaks to Yaakov Avinu again, in the very next posuk?</p>
<p>The answer is obvious and insightful. Until Yaakov Avinu recognized that something was wrong, Hakadosh Boruch Hu could not help him make it right. Once Yaakov understood the realities of raising his children in Golus he longed for his true home in Eretz Yisroel. He was then blessed with Geulah, as Hashem spoke to him and directed his return.</p>
<p>This maxim is true in both Ruchniyus and Gashmiyus. The first step to correcting any problem is recognizing it. Once one identifies the issues, steps can be taken to go and improve. Indeed, in dealing with the challenges of rearing our children, educating them for success and building their self-esteem we must take honest stock of their strengths and weaknesses. Then we must look at ourselves and the environment we provide to nurture these goals. If we are honest in our assessment, we can create a game plan for advancement and our children will IY”H thrive.</p>
<p>As soon as Yaakov Avinu realized the risk of further remaining in the Golus of Lavan’s home, he was blessed to merit redemption with his return to Eretz Yisroel. “Maasei Avos Siman LaBanim”: May we, too, be blessed to sense the urgency and danger of our long Golus and our need to reconnect spiritually so that we may strive to merit the brachos of Geulah, bimahara biyameinu, amen.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h1>Yetzias Tzaddik Oseh Roshum</h1>
<p>Vayeitzei Yaakov. We are familiar with the famous Rashi, which explains that the word vayeitze teaches us a very special lesson. Really, the parsha could have started with vayeilech Charana. However, by commencing with the word vayeitzei, we learn that yetzias tzaddik oseh roshum. When a tzaddik leaves town it makes an impression &#8211; while the tzaddik is in town, he is its pride and splendor. When he leaves the city, its pride and splendor are diminished.</p>
<p>On a practical level it is important to remember that one can never overestimate the impact of the tzaddik on his community. <span id="more-1736"></span>The kedusha of his Torah, mitzvos and maasim tovim permeate the very atmosphere we breathe. The town is different. The hashgocha pratis is more personal. And the hashpa’ah of the tzaddik on our own maasim is immeasurable. Still one cannot help but wonder, why is this lesson being taught here and now? The Torah records that both Avraham and Yitzchok Avinu left their respective communities on more than one occasion. Why is Yaakov Avinu’s departure more significant?</p>
<p>One beautiful pshat was conveyed to this writer by his son learning in kollel in Eretz Yisrael. He remarked that the Yaakov Avinu’s departure was different. Of course the exit of Avraham and Yitzchok from their places of residence had a significant impact in the community. Avraham and Yitzchok were both icons of Torah ugedulah who were renowned for their immense personal wealth and civic impact in their respective dwelling places. Who wouldn’t notice the exodus of such great and famous people and the disappearance of their homes of Torah and chessed from the neighborhood?</p>
<p>But Yaakov Avinu was different. Yaakov was the ish tam yosheiv ohalim. He was still a bochur. He wasn’t out there in the world of outreach and chessed. Nor was he involved in askanus and shtadlanus for the klal. At this point in his life he was living in relative obscurity, he was just sitting, learning and shteiging! He was preparing for our future!</p>
<p>The Torah is being michadesh  that yitzeas Tzaddik oseh roshum is not just for the headliners, those gedolim whom we know and venerate. When the unheralded tzaddik, the one who is totally committed to his learning and growth in yiras shamayim leaves town, it also makes a difference.</p>
<p>We may not know why things have suddenly changed but yitzeas Tzaddik oseh roshum, his departure leaves a profound impression. Moreover, we are being taught that this unknown tzaddik, this masmid and oveid Hashem who is serving the Ribbon Shel Oam bkol kochosav is the one who is really the hod, hadar v’zivah of his community. Unfortunately, he may not be appreciated or even recognized until he has departed.</p>
<p>This should provide us with a mussar haskeil. There are so many young couples, Avreichim and their wives, who follow the path of Yaakov Avinu, as ish tam yosheiv ohalim. They are mosser nefesh for learning. They are totally devoted to their own growth and the vitality of Klal Yisrael’s future through talmud Torah – sometimes in places very far from home. They are unheralded tzaddikim and we should never forget that through their learning, they are oseh roshum, they are making a difference for us all.</p>

<p>This week marks the first anniversary of the terrorist attack on the Chabad House in Mumbai, India. I dedicate this learning to the memory of the Holzberg, who were brutally murdered at that time.</p>
<p>This week’s Torah portion begins with the flight of Yaakov. He is a fugitive, having just snatched the primary blessings of Yitzchak from under his brother Eisav’s nose. Yaakov begins his exodus en route to the home of Lavan his mother’s brother to find his soul mate and marry her.</p>
<p>Does this storyline sound familiar? Did any other biblical characters leave their parent’s home recently?<span id="more-1731"></span> Of course we know that Avraham had just recently departed from Ur Kasdim and began his life in Eretz Yisrael. This week Yaakov begins his spirit walk from Eretz Yisrael to Charan.</p>
<p>There is one major difference however in the types of journeys that Avraham and Yaakov make. Avraham leaves with his entire family and entourage in tow. Avraham was a made man who just needed to make his life in a holier place. His life and family as a Jew were established – they just needed to move. Yaakov was running and he was running penniless, lonely and scared. This is a stark contrast to the Abrahamic journey. Rav Samson Raphael Hirsch points out this contrast to note that this is central to us as Jews.</p>
<p>Yaakov is also known as Yisrael and the only names for the Jewish people found in the Torah are the Bnei Yisrael and Beis Yaakov. We are named for Yaakov. The Jewish people are the children of Yisrael and the <em>House</em> of Yaakov. Today we read about the emergence of the <em>House </em>of Yaakov. Avraham traveled with his family and his home. Yaakov leaves with nothing and he travels to create and family and a home. He established the first Jewish home to bring the Shechina into that home through its existence. The home of Yaakov is a home where Hashem can rest His presence. And the journey to create that home begins in our Parsha. That journey has continued throughout the millennia as we ourselves embark on that same journey to build a home and bring the Shechina into that home.</p>
<p>On the night of Yaakov’s first stop he sleeps on the Temple Mount. Before resting his head he builds a rock formation to protect himself;’ this is the first home of Yaakov. During his slumber Yaakov experiences tremendous Divine revelations with eternal meaning. He witnesses angels ascending and descending a ladder. They are traveling from the Home of GD in the Heavens into the first home of Yaakov. Every Shabbos we greet angels into our home as well.</p>
<p>When Yaakov awakes he exclaims that this place is <em>Home</em> of God, a Beis Elokim. It is a place where God rests His Shechina. The Jewish home is a place where God rests His presence, and thus, is a place where we can find God.</p>
<p>Conversely, other cultures and religions preach going outside the home to “find”God. They look at nature, beauty, philosophy and they search for God. We always hear and know about people searching for God. We don’t hear too much about observant Jews “searching” for God. The observant Jew has no need to search. The message to the Jew is that God is out there but he is in fact much closer as well – he is right here in the home. God resides in the spiritual home and we create that environment for Him. This gives us tremendous power and an important opportunity that not to be missed!</p>
<p>Truthfully, our enemies knew this to be true as well. Later on in the Torah the gentile (pseudo) prophet Bilaam attempts to curse the Jewish people but is unable to do so. Despite his best efforts, he is only able to speak words of blessing.  One of the most poetic and moving sections of the entire Torah is where Bilaam exclaims “Ma Tovu Ohalecha Yaakov Mishkenosecha Yisrael,” “how excellent are your homes,” and he mentions Yaakov. Yaakov is the home and when we allow Hashem to enter we continue the journey that Yaakov began in our Parsha.</p>
<p>The most important asset to Jewish continuity is the Jewish home, which was established outside the land of Israel for the first time by Yaakov. Each one of us is maintaining that home every day. There are some people who raise the ante and are superstars in Jewish home building. Not only do those people establish a home for spirituality, they also share that home with everyone that comes their way.</p>
<p>This week is the anniversary of the terrorist attack on the Chabad House in Mumbai, India. The Holzbergs, previously of Mumbai, took home building to its most positive extreme. They were completely in a spiritual wilderness and managed to bring the Shechina to a spiritually dark corner of the earth. The Holzbergs were tremendous performers of Chesed. Rabbi Holzberg personally shechted chickens each week for all the Jews of Mumbai and for all its guests. Mrs. Holzberg baked 600 rolls per week to give the Jewish people of Mumbai and its visitors. That amount of chesed is a very strong prescription to bring the Shechina into one’s home. Working that diligently to bring Hashem into their home brought a light to their home and to India and to the world that is missed.</p>
<p>One observation I have is that this is the first time I know of that the Jewish home has been under attack. We have gone through attacks on buses, yeshivas, malls, airplanes etc. all in public places. This was the first time we were attacked in the Jewish home. To me this is something to think about. It could be the message here is that our homes are supposed to be immune to attack – but that is only when the spirituality of our collective homes is strong. Our homes have been under siege spiritually for some time now. The pitfalls of Western culture relationships and notions of love and child rearing enter our insulated homes and perhaps it has weakened us to the point where we are now vulnerable to physical attack. As long as our homes are fortresses of spirituality, we are protected but it could be that our homes have suffered from the unyielding onslaught of impurity that permeated our world, leaving us susceptible to attack.</p>
<p>In light of this view our response to terror is not – we must prevent this and raise awareness etc. or maybe if we had more political clout this would not happen or we need to fortify our homes with guns. Our response is purely to replace the missing spirituality from the world that results from their demise. We, as observers, are now charged with the task of replacing the lost chesed and the lost shechina through our own efforts. Incredibly, this is not that hard a task. What it requires from us is a commitment to the Jewish home. To reinforce those barriers that protect us from the spiritual holocaust that is our world. The commitment to continue Yaakov’s journey of building the Jewish home on our own by integrating Torah principles into our home gives the shechina its resting place in our world. The lesson of our Parsha and the lesson of lives lost is the eternal message that we don’t need to find GD – we just need to invite Him into our homes and He will find us.</p>
