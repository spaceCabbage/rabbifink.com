				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This essay was written on October 8, 2013. It was never published. I think it&#8217;s still perfectly relevant.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/" target="_blank">The Pew report</a> confirmed what many Jewish people already knew. Non-Orthodox Judaism is in crisis. According to Professor Stephen M. Cohen over 75% of non-Orthodox Jews are intermarried. About 43% of children of intermarriage consider themselves Jewish. The numbers are devastating and religious leaders are scrambling for solutions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, despite doomsday predictions from the 20th century, the Orthodox Jewish data demonstrates strength and viability. Almost 0% of Orthodox Jews intermarry and over 80% of Orthodox Jews between the age of 19 and 29 stay orthodox.</p>
<p>Some people think this is cause for celebrating Orthodox triumph. Other Orthodox Jews think that Orthodox Jews must step up outreach efforts to bring non-Orthodox Jews into the fold of Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I think there is a third approach.<span id="more-9291"></span></p>
<p>Professor Cohen suggested that <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/editorial-opinion/editorial/losing-our-faith">Orthodox Jews and non-Orthodox increase their social ties</a>. Both groups believe that the other is not interested, but that needs to change.</p>
<p>I agree with Professor Cohen. As it stands right now, Orthodox Jews are enjoined from participating in inter-denominational activities and groups as per a nearly unanimous rabbinic ruling of the generation&#8217;s greatest Torah authorities in the middle of the 20th century. But there is a price to this ruling. The price is very clear boundaries between fellow Jews. Sociologically this has the negative effect of preventing cross-pollination of ideas. Non-orthodox Jews get little access to the vibrancy and beauty of Jewish traditions and practices that are found in Orthodox Judaism.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9293" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/puzzle-pieces-852x500.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="puzzle-pieces-852x500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The context that non-Orthodox Jews have the greatest interaction with Orthodox Jews is <em>&#8220;kiruv.&#8221;</em> But this is not the same as creating social ties that breach the gates of the self imposed ghetto. This is interaction for the purpose of eliciting a specific desired result. I am suggesting interaction for the sake of interaction. Social ties with no strings attached won&#8217;t limit the interactions to potential <em>kiruv</em> candidates and will more likely be institutionally accepted by the non-Orthodox.</p>
<p>A <em>kiruv</em> relationship is one where the Orthodox Jew wants something for the non-Orthodox Jew. But the non-Orthodox Jew may not want the same thing. Even if the non-Orthodox Jew eventually comes to desire the same thing the Orthodox Jew wants, the relationship began as an uneven partnership. The two parties had different goals. The desired outcome is different for each party. The Orthodox  Jew wants the non-Orthodox to adopt an Orthodox lifestyle and the non-Orthodox Jew might simply want a friend. The best relationships are mutually beneficial and are created as balanced partnerships. Both parties have similar goals and aspirations for the relationship. They agree on the hopeful outcome. Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews must create these kinds of social ties. Friendship for the sake of the friendship.</p>
<p>This is aside from the obvious benefit increased intra-denominational activity will have on Jewish unity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2013/10/03/can-liberal-judaism-survive" target="_blank">In an article published by OnFaith</a>, Rabbi David Wolpe suggested that liberal Judaism must embrace rituals in order to survive.<em> &#8220;Wearing Tefillin, praying in Hebrew, Torah study, Kashrut, Jewish communal adherence and activities — these things (while not necessarily limited only to Jews) are activities that keep the core of the tradition alive.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Rituals create a common language and uniquely Jewish experiences. Jews with these collective experiences as part of their religious identity will want to perpetuate these rituals in their family lives. This increases the desirability of marrying Jewish. It&#8217;s not simply tribalism or religious mandate. It&#8217;s a self-interested choice to pass on uniquely Jewish experiences to one&#8217;s children.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s the point of all these rituals? What benefit is there to the non-Orthodox Jew? This is a question that Orthodox Jews are adequately positioned to answer.</p>
<p>Who better than Orthodox Jews to impart the wisdom of these rituals? What better way is there to demonstrate the value in these rituals than the people who do them on a regular basis? It need not be for the purpose of proselytization. It is simply an opportunity to better appreciate the role of rituals in Judaism.</p>
<p>If non-Orthodox Jews are interested in learning about rituals, the Orthodox Jewish community is uniquely poised to step in and create mutually beneficial relationships with non-Orthodox Jews. Now we can honestly say that we are interested in the same outcome. We have an opportunity to create balanced, even friendships. We all want the same thing. This can stimulate increased social ties between all Jews.</p>
<p>Hopefully, non-Orthodox Jews will heed Rabbi Wolpe&#8217;s call and trend toward adding more traditional rituals to their observance. After all, this is a major key to Jewish continuity.</p>
<p>Even among formerly Orthodox Jews who have made the choice to leave Orthodox Judaism, many find that some rituals are worth perpetuating. Most end up marrying fellow Jews. I suspect that this has a lot to do with common experiences and a bit of nostalgia toward their Judaism. That can be replicated within the non-Orthodox Jewish community as well.</p>
<p>The Orthodox Jewish community cannot afford to let this opportunity slip through its fingers either. It is time we adjust our goals and reach across the aisle for the sake of friendship and <strong>mutually agreed upon goals</strong>.</p>
<p>I ask Orthodox and non-Orthodox rabbis and leaders to consider the price of denominational isolation. I ask my Jewish brethren to consider the price of our failure to communicate to one another. We are all in this together. Let&#8217;s act like it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is an ever-present tension between modernity and tradition, especially for Orthodox Jews in America. American culture places significance on tradition, yet manages to remain optimistic about new ideas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to be a fundamentalist. It&#8217;s easy to say everything new is wrong, or everything old is antiquated and bad. But I don&#8217;t believe that we should be looking for what&#8217;s easier. We should welcome the challenges of reconciling tradition and modernity. There is great beauty in using the new to improve the old, and the old to guide the new, without relying on extremes. <span id="more-8957"></span></p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s elections reminded me that the American system of government was revolutionary in the 18th century, our Constitution a groundbreaking document that charted a new course for politics around the world.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/11/05/judaism-needs-to-bring-back-the-tension-between-old-and-new-ideas/kinderhand-und-seniorenhand-child-hand-and-seniors-hand/" rel="attachment wp-att-8962"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/190846.jpeg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Kinderhand und Seniorenhand / Child hand and senior&#039;s hand" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8962" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> We revere the Constitution, and every law passed since its adoption must conform to a valid interpretation. That sounds a lot like Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The Torah was revolutionary around 2500 BCE. It remains a groundbreaking document that charted a new course for religion and theology around the world. We revere the Torah, and all of Jewish law must be based on valid interpretations. To an Orthodox Jew, some of the political tension between old and new feels familiar.</p>
<p>Thinking about this tension raises an interesting thought experiment. If we were starting a new country today, would we write the exact same constitution? Would Newmerica be the same country as Oldmerica?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve frozen time in 1789 and only allowed 27 changes in 225 years. I can&#8217;t help but think about how many other things have been completely discarded since 1789. What is the worldview that grants specialness to political theory from 1789? The &#8220;new&#8221; argument asks why we even bother holding onto a 225 year old vision.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can&#8217;t rewrite fundamental laws every day or even every year. One aspect of the argument in favor of traditionalism is how impracticable it would be to discard the old laws regularly, but this only works to a point. How long is long enough? Another &#8220;old&#8221; argument is that the laws seem to be working. Further, it could be argued that the Founding Fathers were especially smart and saw things in a unique way that renders their opinions superior to ours. But both of these arguments are incomplete and don&#8217;t fully respond to the issues raised by the &#8220;new&#8221; argument. Orthodox Judaism shares this tension with the United States.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this kind of tension leads to revolution. A revolution exclaims &#8220;the old is terrible and the new is good,&#8221; but an extreme reaction to extreme traditionalism is unlikely to yield balanced results. Presently, this tension is handled by Constitutional amendments and Supreme Court reinterpretation, which are ad hoc solutions. The real question is whether the Constitution reflects the best possible formulation of laws for our country today. Answering that would require a comparison between the Constitution and a comprehensive new effort; I&#8217;m not aware of any such effort. I imagine that some might even consider this heretical sounding notion a form of treason.</p>
<p>The current system of law in the United States is a masterful attempt to balance the need to change things with the need for continuity. It works pretty well, and the most important element to the success of a balanced approach that reveres the tradition and embraces modernity is an internal system checks and balances. Power cannot be reserved for the traditionalists, and it cannot be seized by revolutionaries. Both must coexist for optimal success.</p>
<p>This is part of our problem in Judaism today. We&#8217;ve all retreated to our own corners. In the past, we&#8217;ve had orthodoxies and reformers in Judaism, but we were operating within one system. Judaism evolved, but not too hastily. We melded our healthy skepticism of change with our yearning for relevance and flexibility. Then, about 150 years ago, the modernists and traditionalists stopped talking to each other and they stopped working within the same ecosystem. Orthodox Judaism and Reform Judaism were born. People who leaned toward tradition chose Orthodoxy, while people who leaned toward modernity chose Reform. The internal conversation ended. Orthodox Judaism lost significant progressive voices and seems like it was frozen in the 19th century. Reform Judaism felt little allegiance to the ways of old, and seems like it has no definitive doctrine and structure. We all lost.</p>
<p>Ironically, the future of modern Judaism requires that the &#8220;new&#8221; and the &#8220;old&#8221; go back to the traditional conversation of the past. In truth, tradition and modernity are symbiotic. We need to hear the best arguments from both sides in order to move ahead with a commitment to truth and Torah as we navigate the challenges of modernity. We need to go back to a large community that lives in the tension between the past and the future. That was our secret for centuries, and now it&#8217;s time to bring it back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pew conducted a study of Jews in America and has released a comprehensive report based on its findings. Nearly 2800 religious Jewish people were interviewed and the results of those interviews make up the model for the results of the study. It&#8217;s difficult conduct a study like this and achieve meaningful results. I am not a statistician nor can I compare the sample sizes used in this study with others. To my untrained eye, it seems small.</p>
<p>There are many very interesting findings to discuss. I have three things I want to say about the study.</p>
<p>First, people will point to the staggering number of orthodox Jews who are no longer orthodox. That number is 52%. It seems impossible to believe. That means that over half of people raised orthodox are no longer orthodox. Think about the orthodox Jewish friends and family you know. Does it make sense to say that over half of them are no longer orthodox? I don&#8217;t think so.<span id="more-7664"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7665" alt="jew-chp3-3" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp3-3.png?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" />If you drill down a bit you notice a couple of things. For starters, I know many people who say they were raised orthodox because they went to a yeshiva or modern orthodox school even if they weren&#8217;t frum at home. I went to school with several people like that. Those people certainly skew the numbers. After all, the study relied on self identification. There was no process to classify people into categories other than to ask them.</p>
<p>But the real key here what the numbers are for young people being raised in contemporary orthodoxy. Those numbers are impressive. 83% of people raised as orthodox Jews under the age of 30 stay. This is a huge success. It&#8217;s also a number that correlates with anecdotal evidence. So the people who were raised orthodox and no longer are orthodox are mostly older people. What does this mean?</p>
<p>It means one of two things or perhaps a hybrid of two. [It doesn&#8217;t mean that orthodox Jews leave the fold in their 30&#8217;s and 40&#8217;s at alarmingly high rates.] It could either mean that orthodoxy is much stronger today than it was 20 and 30 years ago. People get a better Jewish education, there is more insularity, and the shift to ultra orthodoxy which outnumbers modern orthodoxy by nearly 10:1 in this demographic is working to keep more orthodox Jews orthodox. Alternatively, it signifies a shift in who attends orthodox schools. In other words, 20-30 years ago it was far more likely for a family to send a child to an orthodox school and identify as orthodox even if they were not totally observant of halacha. There was more cross-pollination and there were fewer non-orthodox options. So you wind up with more people from previous generations identifying as being raised orthodox even though they weren&#8217;t truly orthodox through and through. This is rarer today because we are more insular and non-orthodox or unaffiliated Jews feel less comfortable in orthodox institutions. The truth is likely a combination of the two but the latter does concern me.</p>
<p>Also, very few middle aged and older people consider themselves ultra-orthodox. It&#8217;s a youth movement. Sure, some mellow out and switch affiliation. But it&#8217;s also a recent phenomena that is sweeping orthodoxy. It&#8217;s pretty compelling evidence that what is happening now for the under 40 orthodox Jew is different from what their parents and grandparents experienced. It&#8217;s a different kind of Judaism. The numbers bear it out.</p>
<p>Next, the non-orthodox denominations are falling apart. The numbers support the rumblings and rumors regarding the demise of Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism is dwindling as well. Some orthodox Jews like to cheer while these two denominations begin to disappear. Others view it as a sign that those Jews must be saved and brought into orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I think that it is important for Judaism that non-orthodox denominations are strong and vibrant. I think that orthodox Jews should be concerned and make efforts to help revive non-orthodox Judaism. This sounds controversial and heretical but it&#8217;s really not. Orthodox Judaism is not going to magically become the Judaism for the 89% of non-orthodox Jews. We can either wish them well and watch them disappear or we can try to keep them connected to their Jewish heritage. I think the latter choice is preferable. Now we can either keep them connected by &#8220;making them orthodox&#8221; as if that is even possible, or we can rely on strong non-orthodox denominations to keep them in the fold. I think the latter choice is preferable here too. It&#8217;s certainly the more likely option to achieve widespread success. While resources are precious in the orthodox community, I think strengthening the non-orthodox denominations is a worthy endeavor. They are also our brothers and sisters. If we value what we have, we should do whatever we can to help them stay somewhat connected to their Judaism. A little bit of a good thing is a whole lot better than nothing.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7666" alt="jew-chp4-2" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jew-chp4-2.png?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The last thing for now are the numbers on belief in God. 96% of ultra-orthodox Jews are <em>certain </em>that there is a God. Certain. That&#8217;s a very high number. I also wonder how they can all be so certain. The modern orthodox number is 77%. Also a very high number for certainty. 8% of ultra-orthodox Jews believe but are less certain and 19% of modern orthodox Jews fit that description. I think that both of those numbers are really higher. Most people don&#8217;t think about belief in God. They just do it. But the question wasn&#8217;t simply about belief. The question measured the certainty of the believer. I am skeptical that someone can be certain of something without being able to make a compelling argument in favor of that certainty. How many of us can make that argument? If we can&#8217;t, can we be certain? <em>(Stay tuned for an essay on this issue sometime soon.)</em></p>
<p>Perhaps most interesting numbers in this section are the numbers of people who &#8220;do not believe.&#8221; Here the number for ultra-orthodox is 1% while it is 3% for modern orthodox. Practicing Judaism under a state of disbelief s not an easy proposition. If one doesn&#8217;t think the mitzvos and traditions have Divine meaning then they are bound to become a huge burden. However, orthopraxy &#8211; practicing Judaism despite disbelief is a growing trend. I wonder what these numbers will look like in a few years. It&#8217;s possible that more people who do not believe in God will feel comfortable in orthodox Judaism and they will grow as a public group. But it&#8217;s also possible that a rise in those numbers will inspire a thorough vetting of all orthodox Jews which would force all orthoprax Jews into a closet or out of orthodox Judaism altogether.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other interesting numbers to discuss. (97% of ultra-orthodox Jews have all or mostly Jewish friends. That&#8217;s insularity! How about only 57% of orthodox Jews are Republicans? And the support for Israel numbers need addressing as well.) Perhaps I will revisit the study and more of its social commentary in a future post. For now, these are the three things that jumped out at me.</p>
<p><em>Note: The orthodox people surveyed were all from Brooklyn, Monsey, and Lakewood. I think this might be significant.</em> (EDIT: This is imprecise. Those were the oversampled counties. My apologies.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7137" alt="DoubleLife-Cover" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DoubleLife-Cover.jpg?resize=231%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I received a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife: One Family, Two Faiths and a Journey of Hope</a> a few weeks ago. It took a while for me to actually  sit down and read the book but I read it over the weekend and will do my usual review with a side of analysis on the book.</p>
<p>The story is quite intriguing. A Jewish man who makes a living playing music at Church and a Christian woman who does the same fall in love, get married, and end up as orthodox Jews. There&#8217;s a lot of blanks to fill in and the book does a fair job of telling their story.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to notice the book&#8217;s most obvious shtick right away. The entire story is told in letters between Harold and Gayle. Harold&#8217;s letters are written in regular typeset and Gayle&#8217;s are in italics. I found this very distracting. I don&#8217;t like italics. But that might be a personal quirk.</p>
<p>The larger issue is that it seems so artificial. Everything is written in letter format. Even things that couples obviously already know about one another. Normal people do not write letters to each other that ask the big questions like &#8220;will we have a Christmas tree or Hanukkah bush in our home&#8221;. Normal couples do not express themselves in letters to the exclusion of anything else. Yet, the book expects us to believe that all these important conversations took place via letters. Either these are real letters, which is just odd or it&#8217;s a gimmick. Making things worse, in order for this to work logistically, the two of them are almost never together. He is writing about his life, she is writing about her life, but because of the format we rarely get a feel for what life is like for the two of them when they are together. Some people might like this format choice, but I did not. It was weird.</p>
<p><span id="more-7134"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> tells the reader a lot about how difficult life can be for intermarried couples. They really don&#8217;t fit in anywhere. The Christian community does not embrace Howard and Gayle and we all know how skeptical the Jewish community can be of intermarried couples. I was surprised that the more liberal branches of Judaism were so antagonistic toward Howard and Gayle. It could just be that this was their experience and others have had different experiences. But reading the book, one would think that Reform and Conservative rabbis and communities are not welcoming to intermarried couples. This might be true in general, but all one can say from the book is that this was the experience of this couple. I would not say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> dishonestly portrays the positions of other denominations to puff up orthodox Judaism, but it at some points it did feel like that a little bit.</p>
<p>The punchline of the book is that the one place that welcomed Howard and Gayle more than any other was the orthodox Jewish community. In the end, despite their reservations, especially Gayle&#8217;s, the couple settled in the orthodox Jewish community. Gayle had a full orthodox conversion and the couple is has been living as orthodox Jews ever since. I do admit to completely breaking down during the conversion scene in the book. It was very emotional and I felt that the book did an excellent job making the moment work as a true climax of the story.</p>
<p>I wish the book would have spent some more time dealing with the theology of becoming an orthodox Jew. Gayle struggles with it quite a bit and we are never really told what changed her mind from resistance to acceptance of orthodox Judaism. I suspect it was mostly an emotional decision but I thought we should have heard a bit more about the transition.</p>
<p>The book tells a great story, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> also seeks to carve out a place for intermarried couples in orthodox Judaism. On the one hand their story seems to say that they are welcome with open arms, but on the other hand it seems that more resources are needed to handle these situations in the orthodox community. To that end <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> promotes the website created by Howard and Gayle for intermarried couples <a href="http://j-journey.org">j-journey.org</a>. The site seems to focus on orthodox conversion exclusively.</p>
<p>This all leads me to the piercing unasked question raised by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. What should be the Jewish approach to intermarriage. In a generation where more Jews intermarry than &#8220;intramarry,&#8221; what is the best way to handle it?</p>
<p>As it stands now, we discourage intermarriage so vociferously that orthodox rabbis will not officiate the ceremony of an intermarried couple. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> seems to indicate that Reform and Conservative rabbis will not officiate either. What chance do we have of ingratiating an intermarried couple back into Judaism if we can&#8217;t participate in their wedding? I am not saying that we should ignore halacha, God forbid. I am only saying that we stack the deck against the intermarried couple that it becomes extremely difficult to include them in our communities. It is something that we need to work on and I think the Bermans are doing good work by trying to make orthodox Judaism more inclusive for intermarried couples.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. It&#8217;s worthwhile to read the book just to sense of the difficulties that intermarried couples encounter in their spiritual journeys. But more importantly, the book raises questions we must answer about how we handle intermarriage in the modern world. If you have read the book, I welcome your thoughts as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6895" alt="clip_image002" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/clip_image002.gif?resize=300%2C248" data-recalc-dims="1" />Professor Jack Wertheimer of the Jewish Theological Seminary (Conservative &#8211; not the Commentary Magazine kind, the Jewish kind) published a lengthy, <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/the-outreach-revolution/" target="_blank">thorough article on kiruv in the orthodox Jewish community</a>. It comes on the heels of two consecutive Klal Perspectives Journal issues on kiruv. He even quotes one article from KP.</p>
<p>First of all, Wertheimer gets kiruv and he gets the issues it creates. I commend him for writing an article as outsider while somehow grasping many of the nuances of kiruv in the orthodox Jewish world. It was very well done. I was impressed. That being said, he does make a few points that don&#8217;t pass the smell test.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the good observations. First, the article combines Chabad outreach and &#8220;everyone else&#8221;. I am not sure that makes sense. Chabad mostly functions independently of the rest of orthodox Judaism, especially in kiruv. Wertheimer comments that Chabad is sometimes viewed disparagingly by the non-Chabad orthodox Jews and even by the non-kiruv Chabad community. So while the numbers of of kiruv workers are staggering if one includes Chabad, it&#8217;s not so clear that they should be included in the same category as everyone else. Aside from the differences in perspective and allegiances, Chabad outreach is not always outreach, Wertheimer notes. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a service. Is a public service the same as kiruv? Maybe. But many non-Chabad people would say it is not.</p>
<p>The article proposes that the large number of kiruv workers is partially a result of more orthodox Jews who need jobs. This is true. For some people, kiruv is a paycheck. This might explain some of the diminished returns. The numbers in the 1990&#8217;s were higher than they are now. When it was a &#8220;calling&#8221; one could expect more success. Now it is just a job for a lot of people. That might make a difference.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about the article for me was that Wertheimer claims that in confidence non-Chabad kiruv workers told him that they consider it a success even if a prospect does not become orthodox.</p>
<p><span id="more-6894"></span></p>
<p>It is a success even if the prospect is more likely to attend a conservative or reform service. This surprised me. It does not reflect my experience. But while I concede that kiruv workers may be satisfied with that kind of return, their donors are not. Wertheimer notes that donors expect a greater return on their investment. &#8220;<em>Donors are increasingly linking their largesse to quotas: One funder insists that each campus outreach worker must reel in at least seven college students annually. Not surprisingly, these pressures have resulted in creative bookkeeping — and demoralization when unrealistic goals cannot be met.&#8221; </em> I alluded to this in my kiruv article as well. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/28/a-different-kiruv-paradigm/">A Different Kiruv Paradigm</a>)</p>
<p>Werheimer&#8217;s estimated numbers are staggering. He estimates that the &#8220;<em>collective impact of Orthodox outreach may touch between a half million and 700,000 Jews each year, rivaling the impact of the Conservative and Reform movements, and in the majority of cases complementing and enhancing the work of those important movements. </em>To think that we have that kind of influence among the other denominations is incredible.</p>
<p>He goes through some of the tension between orthodox kiruv workers and non-orthodox rabbis as well. One thing I had not thought of was the free Bar Mitzvah lessons and free admission to services on the High Holidays severely cutting into the bottom line of conservative and reform congregations. This is an area that needs to be addressed. We cannot cannibalize non-orthodox institutions.</p>
<p>Also mentioned is the questionable practices of using chicanery or smooth-talking to bait kiruv prospects. It&#8217;s deplorable and he could have spent even more time on it.</p>
<p>Further, the article notes that kiruv is not really a great match for today&#8217;s insular frum communities. He quotes the excellent article by Rabbi Ilan Feldman in Klal Perspectives. <em>“To effectively inspire people to become observant, the effort must be done in isolation from the established Orthodox community,” Rabbi Ilan Feldman laments. “Frum communities as cultures are simply not conducive to outreach.”</em> This is lamentable, but true. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/20/one-excellent-article-from-the-new-klal-perspectives-kiruv-issue/">One Excellent Article From Klal Perspectives Fall 2012 on Kiruv</a>)</p>
<p>The article concludes on a hopeful note. Wertheimer hopes that the ad hoc collaboration of kiruv with non-orthodox institutions can bolster American Jewry. <em>&#8220;The American Jewish community can rely upon a new resource to complement existing religious movements, synagogues, and educational institutions in their collective mission to inspire Jews of all ages to draw closer to their religious tradition.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>One thing that seemed improbable to me was the assertion that most kiruv success stories are formerly conservative Jews. My experience has been the complete opposite. That is, the <em>less </em>one knows about Judaism, the more likely one is to become frum. Conservative Jews are pretty educated and usually are passionate about their traditions. These are the people that are least likely to jump ship and go the orthodox route. Yet, for some reason Wertheimer asserts that they are the most likely. The entire article is devoid of footnotes. This is one area that the omission of footnotes is especially glaring. Perhaps Werhteimer&#8217;s conservative roots are coloring his perspective here.</p>
<p>But the most glaring issue to me was Wertheimer&#8217;s assumption that this is considered &#8220;working together&#8221;. He paints this whole thing as orthodox rabbis working <em>with </em>theconservative and reform movement. As if it&#8217;s some kind of partnership. I don&#8217;t agree. A partnership is where two groups work together. Kiruv can at best be viewed as supplementary. I think that calling it a partnership is a bit disingenuous at this point.</p>
<p>What are we to make of this article?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s remarkable that kiruv is such a huge industry that it is being written up in somewhat glowing terms by a conservative Jewish professor. The assumption has always been that kiruv is viewed as the enemy by non-orthodox Jews. It certainly did not feel that way reading Wertheimer&#8217;s article.</p>
<p>More importantly, an outsider who understands kiruv has some great advice. I think his criticisms must be considered.</p>
<p>But above all, I think we need to rethink the entire paradigm. We, as orthodox Jews, should be able to figure out a way to work together with the non-orthodox for real. Not just as supplements and not just as a safety net. We should be permitted and we should be able to partner in events and programs in which we share common goals. We should seek out such events and make them a priority. Wertheimer insinuates that orthodox Jews no longer view non-orthodox Jews as an enemy. This is only slightly true in some less insular quarters. But we can make it true for all orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, the war is over. No one is really deciding between orthodox Judaism and conservative or reform Judaism. Now the battle is all the denominations vs. secularism and apathy. We are on the same team now. It&#8217;s time to take kiruv to the next level and integrate with non-orthodox Jews for the sake of friendship and brotherhood. It can&#8217;t just be for the sake of kiruv. Those days are gone. Now it is time for real kiruv &#8211; closeness. A closeness for the pure sake of being close.</p>
<p>I think this article tells us that we can do just that. Now let&#8217;s do it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/600px-Ou_kosher.svg_.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4614" title="600px-Ou_kosher.svg" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/600px-Ou_kosher.svg_.png?resize=210%2C210" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In a fascinating religious and social experiment, a young Jewish woman named Emily Langowitz, who was raised as a committed reform Jew lived as an orthodox Jew for one week.</p>
<p>The reform Judaism she grew up with granted her much leeway and autonomy in her observance. She wanted to be able to make an educated choice about which things she wanted to observe and which things she did not want to observe. Her solution was to have a &#8220;frum week&#8221;.</p>
<p>For one week, Ms. Langowitz practiced orthodox Judaism as best she could. She kept the strict rules of kosher, she went to a minyan and prayed from the siddur three times daily, she made a blessing before and after she ate anything, she followed the laws of tznius and she dressed modestly.</p>
<p>Her experience gave her a profound appreciation for the orthodox Jewish lifestyle.<span id="more-4613"></span> Previously held criticisms were disproved by her experience. She found beauty in the minutia of halachic observance. She learned to appreciate the rhythm and music of orthodox Jewish prayer. She found that forcing herself to be conscious of God at all times gave her a greater appreciation for life and life&#8217;s gifts.</p>
<p>The one negative experience of frum week was her status as a woman in the minyan. Ms. Langowitz felt uncomfortable that she did not &#8220;count&#8221; and this would make it hard to continue praying in that atmosphere no matter how wonderful and warm the community was towards her.</p>
<p>The short of it is that for an outsider, orthodox Judaism can seem daunting, dated and difficult. But Ms. Langowitz found out how beautiful, relevant and inspiring it can be as well.</p>
<p>She was able to pick up on so many of the social, psychological and religious benefits to the halachic lifestyle in just one week. I think it is just as important for orthodox Jews to recognize those same benefits. Sometimes it takes an outsider to point them out to us. Luckily for us, Ms. Langowitz has done so. Thank you.</p>
<p>There is another thing. The intellectual honesty of Ms. Langowitz is to be complimented. I know a lot of unaffiliated Jews. Many of them are religious. Many of them are partially observant. Or selectively observant. But most of them have never explored the depth and vast richness of orthodox Judaism. They, like most people do what they do because that is what they do. They have not learned to appreciate what they do and certainly have not become educated on what they do not do. Frum week is a way of bucking this trend.</p>
<p>It is so important to understand our own personal choices and not just let them be default choices. This is something we can all learn from Ms. Langowitz.</p>
<p>Finally, the entire premise of Ms. Langowitz&#8217;s experiment is to observe orthodox Judaism without studying the rationale and reasoning behind. Nor has she studied the theological underpinnings of the halachic lifestyle. She didn&#8217;t profess to believe in the 13 Fundamentals of Faith. She has not accepted &#8220;Torah M&#8217;Sinai&#8221;. And yet, it has worked. She has enjoyed it. She has learned from it. It has changed her life.</p>
<p>I think this will be surprising to many orthodox Jews. Particularly with the vicious attacks against orthopraxy that we have seen in the last few years. Here is a prime example of successful orthopraxy. Ms. Langowitz practiced without believing. She was able to appreciate and experience the beauty of Judaism without professing any beliefs.</p>
<p>I have nothing more to say on this particular point right now. But it was certainly thought provoking.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="Glenn Beck" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.prisonplanet.com/images/september2009/150909top3.jpg?resize=371%2C182" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />I know that Glenn Beck is primarily an entertainer. I don&#8217;t think most people take him to be a scholar or expert on most important matters. He is a radio personality. He has a nice voice, a good shtick and a loyal following. Sure, I found his Nazi references ironic (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/27/glenn-beck-and-peta-in-lockstep-goose-step-on-international-holocaust-remembrance-day/" target="_blank">Glenn Beck and PETA in Lockstep (Goose Step?) on International Holocaust Remembrance Day</a>). But overall, I don&#8217;t care all that much what he has to say. In much the same way that I don&#8217;t care what more liberal entertainers have to say. It&#8217;s just entertainment.</p>
<p>But yesterday, Beck made another inane comment that made me realize something.<span id="more-3836"></span></p>
<p>First, the context:</p>
<p>Beck is talking about the 400 rabbis who took out an ad to protest his Nazi references. His point has been that these rabbis are not really religious rabbis, they are social action rabbis who don&#8217;t care about religion. Instead they &#8220;worship&#8221; liberalism. So there is no reason to take them seriously.</p>
<p>Now here is the comment:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“When you talk about rabbis, understand that most &#8212; most people who are not Jewish don&#8217;t understand that there are the Orthodox rabbis, and then there are the reformed rabbis. Reformed rabbis are generally political in nature. It&#8217;s almost like Islam, radicalized Islam in a way, to where it is just &#8212; radicalized Islam is less about religion than it is about politics. When you look at the reform Judaism, it is more about politics.”</em></p>
<p>My only real commentary on this is that the when you make an analogy you can be as broad or as narrow as you want. You could analogize the Religious Right in the GOP to radicalized Islam too. Watch this: the Religious Right in the GOP is just like radical Islam, they want to enforce a religious law on all people. See what I did there? Anyway, the test of an analogy is to see if it makes sense in any other contexts. So, do radicalized Islam and the GOP share anything else? Not really. So it&#8217;s a dumb analogy.</p>
<p>Reform Rabbis and radicalized Islam share even less.</p>
<p>Oh and FYI, Orthodox Rabbis are also plenty about politics.</p>
<p>But here is what this whole thing got me thinking: Almost a couple hundred years ago, Reform Judaism was in its infancy and was gaining traction among the young Orthodox Jews in Germany. People were jumping off the orthodox bandwagon by the dozen. It presented a real problem for the future of Orthodox Judaism. In response, two general approaches were developed. The Chasam Sofer and Rav Samson Rafael Hirsch the leaders of each. They each tried as best they could to stem the tide of those abandoning Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>No matter their tactics, it turns out that today Reform Judaism and Orthodox Judaism have very little to do with each other. Further, the bandwagons have very few people jumping back and forth between them. For almost all Jews today, there is no conscious choice between Reform and Orthodox. Most stay where they are or leave organized religion entirely.</p>
<p>My point is that practically speaking, there is no longer a battle between Reform and Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Yet, the rhetoric from both sides still sounds like it is 1860. Most Orthodox Jewish rabbis would probably agree with Beck that Reform Rabbis are not &#8220;real&#8221; rabbis. Orthodox Rabbis frequently confuse the word &#8220;Jew&#8221; with &#8220;orthodox&#8221; and basically call anyone not orthodox, not Jewish. I doubt we will see too many Orthodox Rabbis &#8220;defend the honor&#8221; of their reform counterparts.</p>
<p>(Similarly, I cannot recall hearing an Orthodox Rabbi being praised by a Reform Rabbi. It just doesn&#8217;t happen.)</p>
<p>I hereby offer my puny voice. I disagree with Beck. I think Reform Rabbis are learned, spiritual leaders and teachers who are important for the future of Judaism.</p>
<p>Really, even the most cynical of Orthodox Rabbis should agree with this. Why? Because if not for Reform Judaism, almost all secular Jews would completely lose their connection to Judaism. Isn&#8217;t it better, even from an orthodox perspective that Jews retain a Jewish identity? Marry other Jews? Contribute to the social welfare of the world? Come to shul on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur? How about every Shabbos? Advocate for Israel? Isn&#8217;t Judaism as a whole stronger if there is a reform movement?</p>
<p>I think the answer is yes.</p>
<p>I will even take it a step further. Reform Judaism challenged Rav Hirsch and the Chasam Sofer to sharpen their hashkafos and approach to Judaism. Today Reform Judaism challenges us to fine tune our observance as well (within the construct of halacha of course). Without mentioning specifics, I think it is worth noting  that Orthodox Judaism is being challenged by Reform Judaism in a good way. It&#8217;s a mild form of kinas sofrim (competition among scholars). That is also a good thing.</p>
<p>So in summary, I think Glenn Beck&#8217;s obtuse criticism of &#8220;Reformed Rabbis&#8221; is misguided. He probably thinks that all reform Jews are evil and not &#8220;really Jews&#8221; just like many Orthodox Jews. (Where would he get this from? Let&#8217;s just say there are some Orthodox Jews in his ear&#8230;) But I disagree. I salute Reform Judaism and its Rabbis. Although we may disagree about theology, we all desire for Judaism to remain strong and vibrant. Like many presumed enemies, we have much more in common than we may think and if the rhetoric is toned down, we may actually be able to work side by side (even if not hand in hand) towards our common goals.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE: Beck apologized. Kind of.</strong></p>

More discussion there: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/11/reform-jews-interested-in-kashrus.html">Reform Jews Interested in Kashrus</a></p>
<p>Ask most Orthodox Jews about Kashrus and Reform Judaism, you&#8217;ll most likely hear a snicker from the uninformed or a reference to the &#8220;Treyfe Banquet&#8221; (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/12/new-national-museum-of-american-jewish-history-in-philadelphia-apparently-misses-the-mark/">New National Museum of American Jewish History In Philadelphia Apparently Misses the Mark</a>) from the more informed. As far as I know, Reform Judaism has never officially sanctioned Kashrus observance.<span id="more-3302"></span></p>
<p>I remember reading an article 3 years ago about young Reform Jews pining to add more ritual observance to their summer camp experience. They wanted to add tefillin, kashrus and a more traditional Shabbos. At the time, I thought that was really cool. (read about it here: <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/reform_youth_flexing_their_ritual_muscle" target="_blank">The Jewish Week</a>).</p>
<p>Today, I saw another step in this direction referenced on Twitter (HT @<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/schnit/status/4586916221550592" target="_blank">schnit</a>). A new book has been published for Reform Jews that want to observe some level of Kashrus. Apparently, this is a first. The book tackles broader issues than simple dietary restrictions such as animal cruelty and treatment / paying laborers.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s great. I would only hope that just as Reform Jews are learning from the ideals of Orthodox Jews as far as Kashrus is concerned, Orthodox Jews can learn from the concern the Reform Jews express for animal cruelty and treatment / paying laborers.</p>
