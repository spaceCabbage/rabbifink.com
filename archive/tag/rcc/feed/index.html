				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7128" alt="alaska-erosion-photo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" /></a>The fallout over the Doheny Kosher meat scandal continues. This week, the Jewish Journal reported that three kosher restaurants have dropped the RCC Hechsher in favor of alternative hechshers.</p>
<p>This can only mean one thing. RCC is not as good for the bottom line as the other hechshers. The only real reason a restaurant will switch is to increase business. It seems that RCC businesses are suffering. I have some first hand information from vendors that this is the case as well.</p>
<p>It goes even further. Shiloh&#8217;s Restaurant has a splash page of their website that assures customers that they are and always have been using Kehilla for their hechsher and not RCC. The note distances Shiloh&#8217;s from Doheny Kosher Meat as well. See the note here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gUiNl0R.png" target="_blank">Shiloh&#8217;s</a></p>
<p>All this can only mean one thing. A significant number of people have been spooked by the kashrus scandal. It goes so far that people need to be reassured that a kosher restaurant did not purchase any meat from Doheny.<span id="more-7127"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. The halachic authority who was counseled on this case and is a senior <em>posek</em> for the OU already said that there was no halachic problem for consumers or restaurants who bought from Doheny. The RCC has admitted there were issues and they are fixing them. Some of the restaurants that switched don&#8217;t even sell meat!</p>
<p>The point here is that people are basically ignoring the halachic psak given in this case. Who are these people? Are they <em>frummer</em> than halacha? Why would anyone be concerned if a restaurant got meat from Doheny? The psak is that there is no problem if one bought meat from Doheny? What are they worried about?</p>
<p>The funny thing is that people will harp on Daas Torah for every <em>chumra</em> or <em>hashkafic</em> nuance as long as it looks more frum. But the second Daas Torah says something is permissible those same people become independent thinkers who don&#8217;t rely on Daas Torah.</p>
<p>On the one hand I see this as an erosion of Daas Torah. Some might see that as a positive development. Some might see that as a negative development. Either way, it seems that people are not buying into Daas Torah completely. It&#8217;s only when it suits my <em>chumra</em> lifestyle or to marginalize others that I will listen to Daas Torah they say. On the other hand not trusting RCC (especially for dairy!) after a <em>psak</em> that says there is nothing to worry about from a halachic perspective, is a huge problem. If we do not rely on our <em>poskim</em> for <em>heter</em> we are in big trouble. I do not like the direction this is heading. We must be able to rely on <em>psak halacha, </em>especially when the halacha is lenient.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6878" alt="trust_action" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/trust_action-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" />The latest twist in the Doheny Kosher Meats scandal is that Shlomo Yehuda Rechnitz, a well known community activist and philanthropist will be buying the butcher shop. He will keep the store from closing down in the wake of the scandal and it is expected that the RCC will reissue their supervision on the store under its new ownership.</p>
<p>The key to this resurrection will be that the quality we have come to expect from Doheny Meats will be maintained and the steady flow of kosher meat will continue from the area&#8217;s largest provider of kosher meat.</p>
<p>This is great news for the consumers of Los Angeles. Our community is blessed to have a man with the magnanimous nature of Shlomo Yehuda Rechnitz. Stepping into this mess is a  wonderful gesture, the likes of which the LA community is accustomed to because we have been spoiled by Shlomo Yehuda Rechnitz.</p>
<p>There are many people who would only buy kosher meat if it was of the quality that is found at Doheny and losing the shop completely would have likely resulted in fewer people observing kosher laws. Keeping the store open is huge for this reason alone. But additionally, it is imperative that the flow of meat continue unabated to avoid a major shortage and price escalations. For the Jewish people of Los Angeles who keep kosher.<span id="more-6877"></span></p>
<p>For Mike Engleman, soon to be former owner of Doheny Kosher Meats, it is a pretty sweet compromise. He will lose his business, but he will be paid for it. He might be hated and villified by many members of the community, but he gets out of a tought situation all while keeping some face and some cash. It could have been much worse for him.</p>
<p>However, there is something that does concern me a bit.</p>
<p>The RCC will not give a hechsher to Doheny if it is owned by Engleman. On the one hand, this is reasonable. Mike has no credibility and might try to pull similar shenanigans again if given the opportunity. The RCC does not owe him a hechsher. They can supervise whom they choose to supervise. If they choose to supervise Rechnitz, they are certainly within their rights to do so.</p>
<p>The minor issue I have is twofold. First of all, I wish that we could just give hechsherim to food, not to people. It seems to me that the butcher is just a mechanical actor. His role is to provide the meat. The supervisor&#8217;s role is to make sure the meat is kosher. I don&#8217;t love the idea that the meat can be technically kosher, but we won&#8217;t supervise the meat and give it our approval because the butcher is a bad guy. I can hear it, but I don&#8217;t love it.</p>
<p>What really gets me is that the RCC is saying that they can no longer trust Engleman. That&#8217;s the rub. They never should have to trust him or anyone they supervise. Their job is <em>not</em> to trust their clients. They must be vigilant and super skeptical about everyone. The fact that their mashgiach was not doing his job and this enabled crooked behavior only proves that we need more and better supervision. From their perspective it seems like they think they need to trust their clients. No! They need to distrust their clients! They shouldn&#8217;t decline to supervise because they don&#8217;t trust someone. The reason we need the RCC to supervise is because we <em>don&#8217;t </em>trust purveyors of kosher food <em>unless</em> they are supervised.</p>
<p>After the Monsey kosher scandal few, if any, improvements were made to the kashrus system in place. They went into the scandal with the attitude that we can trust people who look and act frum and they left the scandal the same way.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if the only public improvement following this scandal was frummer owners of butcher shops. We need better supervision too. Ideally we should be able to trust one another. When it comes to religious law, we say &#8220;one witness is believed&#8221; &#8211; even an involved witness. But kashrus is no longer about religious law. It has become big business. In business we always require two witnesses. To me, this means we should step up the level of supervision and not rely on &#8220;trust&#8221; no matter who the person is that we are trusting.</p>
<p>So while I absolutely concede that the RCC has the right to supervise whomever they choose at their discretion, it concerns me that they seem to express their unwillingness to supervise a shop owned by Engleman simply because they cannot trust him. They can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t trust anybody. That&#8217;s why we need them to do the important job they are doing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6836" alt="store-front" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/store-front.jpg" width="293" height="200" />As of Sunday March 24, 2013 at 3 PM, Doheny Kosher Meats is no longer under the rabbinic supervision of the RCC. In a statement released to the greater Los Angeles community, the RCC said that the hechsher was removed for cause.</p>
<p>KTLA news reports that a private investigator filmed Doheny Kosher receiving empty boxes with kosher labeling on them and a stash of kosher labels. It appears that this is the extent of what has been discovered. This is a violation of the agreement between Doheny and the RCC thus invalidating their supervision. It also implies that Doheny has been receiving non-kosher meat deliveries and replacing the non-kosher labels with kosher labels.</p>
<p>However, it does not seem that any non-kosher meat was found in Doheny nor were there any deliveries of non-kosher meats filmed. Therefore, the status of the meat purchased before the breach of protocol was discovered is still considered kosher. This is because a kosher store has a &#8220;status&#8221; (chazaka) of kosher until there is evidence to the contrary. There is only evidence of a breach of protocol so the entire store is now suspect but before this breach was discovered the halachic status quo remains intact and the food is considered kosher. Pots and dishes are also considered kosher.</p>
<p>At this point, nothing other than the breach of protocol is certain. It is possible, although very remote, that this all an honest mix up.</p>
<p>In contrast with the Monsey Kosher Scandal, there was no non-kosher meat discovered. In Monsey, chickens from non-kosher distributors were discovered on site. This meant that there was no longer &#8220;doubt&#8221; about some of the meat and the halachic status was invalidated.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Doheny was involved in a kashrus dustup when it was forced to go all Glatt lest it lose its hechsher. They complied.</p>
<p>Right now there are four unanswered questions.</p>
<p>1) Was non-kosher meat delivered to Doheny and was it distributed to its consumers?</p>
<p>2) Who hired the private detective and why?</p>
<p>3) Why did it take a private investigator to discover this breach and not the paid mashgiach?</p>
<p>4) Everyone said Doheny meats tasted the best. I&#8217;ve heard this for years. They said the same thing about the guy in Monsey&#8217;s meats. Why do non-kosher meats taste better?<span id="more-6835"></span></p>
