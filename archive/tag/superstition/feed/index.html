				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A fascinating long-form article in the Atlantic by Stuart Vyse grapples with the various aspects of magical belief. The headline is more misleading than most headlines, as it indicates that the article will be discussing how superstition works. It does not. Instead, we get a bunch of examples of superstition, which is nice, but not an answer to the question.</p>
<p>For me, biggest bombshell in the article was the extent to which the Reagan administration relied on pure superstition. It&#8217;s disconcerting that the leader of the free world was living his life and governing based on meaningless signs and astrology. See the article for more on this.</p>
<p>The problem I have with the article is that Vyse conflates superstition with ritual.<span id="more-7757"></span></p>
<p>Superstition is defined as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>1. An irrational belief that an object, action, or circumstance not logically related to a course of events influences its outcome.</em><br />
<em> 2. a. A belief, practice, or rite irrationally maintained by ignorance of the laws of nature or by faith in magic or chance. b. A fearful or abject state of mind resulting from such ignorance or irrationality. c. Idolatry.</em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kabbalah_red_string.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7759" alt="kabbalah_red_string" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kabbalah_red_string.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the examples in the article are unambiguously superstitious or pure magical thinking. Blowing on dice before a crapshoot, thinking the full moon affects behavior, or belief in premonition. But when we think of superstition we usually think of things like fear of Friday the 13th, or finding a horseshoe, or opening an umbrella indoors, or seeing black cats. These are events outside one&#8217;s control that one should not think are omens or that somehow these incidents portend good or bad news. That is classic superstition.</p>
<p>Many of the example in the article are not superstition as much as they are rituals. It is common to relieve anxiety by creating patterns of behavior. It calms us. It soothes us. So when the article mentions basketball players who do the same thing before they take a foul shot, it&#8217;s not that the ritual will magically affect the shot. Rather, the ritual relaxes the shooter and takes the person from a place of thinking about the shot to a place where the shot is part of a routine. This relieves nerves. Not magically though.</p>
<p>Or when college students wear a &#8220;lucky sweater&#8221; for an exam, it&#8217;s not because they think the sweater actually brings them luck. Rather, it&#8217;s soothing to have familiarity when one does unfamiliar things. It&#8217;s not magical thinking. I am sure there are some people who think their lucky sweater is actually a magical sweater. But for others, it&#8217;s just a way of using familiar objects and activities to find inner peace. That&#8217;s not magical thinking.</p>
<p>Religion can be both at times. Judaism has some pure superstitions as well. These are things that are not Divine commandments which people believe can change their luck or problems. Wearing a red string is perhaps the most famous of these examples.</p>
<p>Much of what all religions teach is magical. If one does not believe in God, then we would rightly call it all superstition. But there are many things within religion that are more ritual than superstition. Actions, movements, incantations, and the like that are not done for the sake of achieving a magical result. While it may be part of the religious belief that rituals will yield a magical result, the ritual has independent value. As the rabbis teach us in the name of Antignus Ish Socho who heard it from Shimon HaTzadik &#8220;Do not serve God like a servant who is trying to earn a prize.&#8221; We are instructed not to do Mitzvos for the magical reward. Their value comes in many forms. One of these forms is the benefit of ritual.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some people who think that none of the Mitzvahs make sense and we are doing them for the mystical benefit. However Maimonides and Rabbi Hirsch went to great lengths to demonstrate the ritualistic and humanistic benefits of Mitzvah observance.</p>
<p>Every commandment and sub-commandment has within it a ritualistic component that can enhance and improve our lives independent of supernatural effects and rewards. The version of Judaism that works best for me is the version that focuses on the ritual side of things as opposed to the magical. Following this path, we find that rituals have benefit even if one is struggling with core beliefs of Judaism. If one&#8217;s Judaism requires absolute belief in God in order to recognize any benefits to Mitzvah observance then if that foundational belief is not solid, the entire edifice comes crashing down. However, finding benefit and comfort and spirituality in the rituals themselves has a far greater chance of surviving a crisis of belief.</p>
<p>Science has shown that ritual even has the benefit improving the taste of one&#8217;s food. The little things that we do before we eat have been shown to enhance the flavor of what we are eating. (See: <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/rituals-make-our-food-more-flavorful/" target="_blank">NY Times</a>) It&#8217;s reasonable to assume that rituals have a similar effect in other areas of one&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s even possible that some superstitions navigate from magical to ritual over time. While we can scoff at the pure magical thinking of superstition, it is important to recognize the very real benefits of ritual.</p>
<p>Rituals can enhance our lives in a non-magical way. They provide comfort, they soothe us, they calm us, they make life taste better. No amount of magical thinking can all rituals to superstition.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/conspiracy-theory-alert.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7112" alt="conspiracy-theory-alert" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/conspiracy-theory-alert-300x262.jpg" width="300" height="262" /></a>One would think that the Internet would be good for at least one thing. It should help debunk conspiracies. After all, all one needs to do is do a little Googling to find out if there are actual facts to support a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Compared with the pre-Internet dark ages, it would seem to be much easier to debunk conspiracies. But in fact the opposite is true. Conspiracies proliferate on the Internet. People find confirmation for their ideas on the Internet, no matter how crazy the ideas may be, and so the Internet provides more fuel to the fire of conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>The NY Times published an article trying to explain why rational people believe in conspiracies and what kind of people believe in conspiracies.</p>
<p>It seems that the primary factors of conspiracy theorists are cynicism about the world, cynicism about politics, low self-worth, and a feeling of powerlessness. In other words, believing in conspiracies may be a defense mechanism against these sorts of feelings. Correlation does not equal causation, obviously, but there is some reasoning behind this as well.</p>
<p>When people feel like they have little say in the world and they feel that the world is &#8220;out to get them&#8221; they can regain some semblance of control by claiming to have inside information and a broader understanding of what is happening in the world.<span id="more-7111"></span></p>
<p>Reacting to the news that a formerly chasidic woman lost custody of her children, many people see a conspiracy. They see a judge that is biased because she is bought by chasidic groups. Or they see a a judge who favors a religious home over a secular home. Or they see a judge who is afraid to stand up to a very powerful chasidic community. All of these things are possible. However, there are also legitimate reasons she lost custody.</p>
<p>Seeing things that may or may not be there to support an overarching narrative is conspiracy-like. It also fits in well with the typology of people who buy into a conspiracy. Many of the people buying into the conspiracy are ex-hasids who are cynical about the chasidic world (rightfully so!), may feel marginalized by that world (they are), and are certainly likely to feel powerless in that world. It&#8217;s empowering to have an overarching narrative to explain what happened.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that there is a conspiracy, but I don&#8217;t think it is supported by the facts that I read. I don&#8217;t begrudge anyone for trying to advocate on the mother&#8217;s behalf and I support those who do not want courts to include any religious considerations in custody proceedings. But I think there is a reason</p>
<p>I think this can also relate to people who buy into <em>segulos</em> and magical mystical mystery thinking. People who are cynical about the world because of anti-Semitism or theologically based xenophobia, who feel powerless because the world is &#8220;out to get them&#8221; or because there are dark forces that are making things difficult, are prime candidates to turn to solutions not based in reality. They will use &#8220;spiritual&#8221; cures for illness or everyday superstition or they turn to snake oil salesmen pitching salvation for the same reasons people believe in conspiracies. I think they are very similar.</p>
<p>In politics I think this bears out as well. <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/05/oklahoma-tornado-conspiracy-theories/65499/" target="_blank">People who think President Obama made the tornado</a> with a fancy weather maker to distract from current political scandals match some of these factors. They think Obama is out to get them. They think that they are doomed. They think they are powerless to stop Obama. So they turn to conspiracy theories to empower themselves as the ones who &#8220;get it&#8221;.</p>
<p>As we learn more about the brain we will learn more about why people think the way they do. We live in exciting times. Although, I am concerned that the NY Times is a conspiracy newspaper written by Jews to achieve world domination. You can read about it in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. (Just kidding!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tefillin.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6144" title="tefillin" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/tefillin-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Last week, an apocryphal story was being circulated on the JewsNews sites. The story goes something like this: A man bought a pair of tefilin 18 years ago. He used them for 12 years and then gave them to his son-in-law who used them for six years. During the 12 years the man used the tefillin he lost two of his sons before they reached bar mitzvah. One was 12 and the other was 6. During the time that the son-in-law used the tefillin his son a was very badly burned among other difficulties.</p>
<p>The tefillin were checked for mistakes and a missing word was the discovered. It seems that the word &#8220;Bni&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;my son&#8221;  was missing from one of the chapters.</p>
<p>The story is being circulated by the scribe who checked the tefillin to urge people to check their tefillin.</p>
<p>In case you need someone to connect the dots for you, the story is making the claim that the missing word is related to the death and burning of the three sons in the story. That relationship is undefined in the story but it goes something like this: The tefillin had a mistake in the word Bni and that either caused or should have alarmed the owners that something was going to happen with their sons.</p>
<p>First of all, whenever you hear a story like this, consider the source. The source is a tefillin checking company. Is that a proof that the story is untrue? No. But it seriously affects the credibility of the story.</p>
<p>Second of all, all tefillin are checked before they are sold. I find it unlikely that a mistake as glaring as a missing word slipped by the checkers. It&#8217;s not as if a word can simply disappear and the other words slip into place leaving no empty space for the missing word.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s assume the facts of the story are true. What do we make of this?<span id="more-6142"></span></p>
<p>The idea that a mistake, an honest mistake, in one&#8217;s tefillin is troubling theologically. Normative Jewish thought emphasizes intent for good deeds and deemphasizes strict liability for mistakes. To illustrate: If one intends to give charity but then the money gets stolen, God will credit the person for giving the charity because the person had intent and the action that was attached to the intent was not completed due to something out of his control. Conversely, if one intends to sin but because of circumstances our of one&#8217;s control, the sin is never committed, one is not liable for the sin. Further, if one sinned by mistake or through negligence the sin is not considered a full sin, rather it is a separate category of mistake and none of the usual punishments apply, rather one would bring a sacrifice to atone for the mistake.</p>
<p>So it seems incongruous that a missing word in the tefillin would have such a drastic effect if it was an error when if one violated the Shabbos by mistake one would only need to bring a sacrifice!</p>
<p>The idea that people would die because of scribal errors is troubling for other reasons as well. This is a case of the sharpshooter fallacy. Tefillin have mistakes all the time. Yet, almost none of the people wearing those tefillin suffer the degree of harm suffered in this story. This story is highlighted because the facts work out neatly, but ask any scribe about the myriad of other mistakes that are found due to wear and tear or poor writing in the first place (assuming this does happen) and you won&#8217;t hear of correlating tragedies. How do I know? Because if it happened all the time, we would hear about it all the time. Classic sharpshooter fallacy.</p>
<p>Additionally, what kind of God kills children because of scribal errors?</p>
<p>The usual response to this is that God is not as nice as we would like to think. God is very harsh. There are tragedies and sadness in the world and God allows them to happen. Why should this be any different? The response to that logic is that there is nothing to be gained by making God even meaner than God already appears to be. In other words, there are some things that we must accept theologically and there are others that we do not. Why would we want to turn our God into a God who avenges scribal errors with death of children if we are not forced to do so by any preexisting rule of theology?!</p>
<p>Finally we get to the core of the issue. People who find this story meaningful are borrowing a widespread idea about mezuzah and applying it to tefillin. A fairly recent principle states that a mezuzah is a form of magical protection over one&#8217;s home. If the mezuzah is incomplete or missing, one loses the protection. It has therefore become en vogue to &#8220;check the mezuzah&#8221; if tragedy befalls a home. The sharpshooter fallacy applies here as well. Yet, this idea has a lot of traction. What is happening in this story is the mezuzah concept is being extended to tefillin.</p>
<p>There are two very significant problems with this.</p>
<p>1) There are many sources that attribute protection to mezuzah. The interpretation of those sources is the subject of #2. But the sources are there. So while subject to the analysis of #2, mezuzah may have theological basis to be a protection and mezuzah errors may foretell or even cause harm, no such sources exist for tefilin as far as I know. Thus, extending the mezuzah concept to tefilin may be a complete fabrication. That is a problem,</p>
<p>2) Do we have to believe that a mistake in a mezuzah can cause harm? The answer is no. An excellent article by Professor Martin Gordon debunks the magical protections of mezuzah as a recent and unnecessary innovation. You can read the article here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mezuza-gordon.pdf" target="_blank">Mezuzah: Protective Amulet or Religious Symbol</a>. In essence, Dr. Gordon shows that there is no basis to compel one to accept the idea that checking one&#8217;s mezuzah is a form of insuring against tragedy. There is no necessary theological reason to believe in the magical powers of mezuzah in the first place. If we take the rug from under the mezuzah belief then there is no analogy to tefilin that could make this story meaningful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to end with the words of Rambam at the end of the Laws of Mezuzah:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Whoever wears tefillin on his head and arm, wears tzitzit on his garment, and has a mezuzah on his entrance, can be assured that he will not sin, because he has many who will remind him. These are the angels, who will prevent him from sinning, as [Psalms 34:8] states: &#8220;The angel of God camps around those who fear Him and protects them.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Blessed be God who offers assistance.</em></p>
<p>This might sound like some sort of support for the idea that mezuzah and tefilin are related to one&#8217;s safety. However, a careful reading debunks this as well. Rambam is saying that wearing a mitzvah on one&#8217;s arm and head, one&#8217;s body, and placing a mitzvah on one&#8217;s door will protect a person <em>from sin </em>because they will serve as <em>reminders </em>of what one is supposed to do. Rambam continues, <em>these </em>are the angels. Meaning, the reminders provided by doing mitzvahs are the angels. Not that doing these mitzvahs <em>creates</em> magical creatures who protect us. Rather the constant reminders help us avoid sin and those reminders serves a metaphorical guardian angel that aids us in avoiding sin. This fits in well with Rambam&#8217;s rejection of the usual understanding of angels as magical creatures that exists in reality.</p>
<p>It is not a surprise that Rambam does not believe in the magical powers of tefilin and mezuzah. Nor is it a surprise that orthodox Jews believe in it today. But we do not do mitzvahs because we are looking for magical protections. We do them because God commanded us to do so. We believe that they are good acts that help us perfect ourselves. But we do not need to hang on to <em>bubbe mysahs </em>like this recent tale to serve Hashem properly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/superstition.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5148" title="superstition" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/superstition-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>A light hearted article in Tablet Magazine caught my eye today. The writer, Allison Hoffman, is a reform Jew who is in the midst of a pregnancy.</p>
<p>As a reform Jew, Ms. Hoffman takes pride in her enlightened, rational, science and fact based beliefs. She is not superstitious, nor does she use halacha as a guide for living her life. Like many reform Jews, she may equate the two as one and the same.</p>
<p>The problem for Ms. Hoffman is that during her pregnancy she has developed some nasty superstitions. Like many women who are carrying a fetus inside their body, Ms. Hoffman has developed a need to protect her baby at all costs. And this includes tapping into tried and true superstitions like not calling the baby by name until the baby is born and formally named.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all seen this happen. Perfectly rational people become irrational at certain times. Ms. Hoffman talks about her experience as a pregnant mom. Death does the same thing to other rationalists. Illness does it to others. Ironically enough, this phenomena has a scientific explanation too. When there is a uncertainty and doubt, the mind seeks to establish some control over the situation. Thus superstitions emerge.<span id="more-5147"></span></p>
<p>Ms. Hoffman is disappointed that there are so few superstitions in reform Judaism. The whole thing is rather entertaining. As a side note, it is interesting to see people defend superstitions that were borrowed from pagans or non-Jews as &#8220;real&#8221; or kabbalistic.</p>
<p>Pregnancy is one of life&#8217;s greatest mysteries. So much that is happening is unobservable and the stakes are so high that we want to somehow influence the result. We do what we cant, but we wish we could do more. We start to develop superstitions.</p>
<p>Death is no different. What happens after we die? What happens to the soul? What does it feel like? All these questions cannot be answered by observable fact. Science does not address these questions, other that to say &#8220;nothing&#8221;. Rational people become less rational around death. People who don&#8217;t believe in God or care about Mitzvah observance will come to shul and say Kaddish. I&#8217;m not saying that Kaddish is superstition. I am saying that it is out of character for a rational, non-believer to say a prayer for someone who died.</p>
<p>What does all of this mean?</p>
<p>It means that when things require an explanation but there is no explanation coming, human nature is to turn to a deity. This is what we call The God of Gaps. This belief system asserts that since not everything can be explained the only explanation that remains is God. In other words, God is to be found in the mysteries of life. Superstition and religion are siblings in this model. Closely related. Religion is legitimate beliefs that cover things that we can&#8217;t explain. Superstition are illegitimate beliefs that accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p>The problem with this belief system is that there is a line of progress that is shrinking the gaps. Drastically. What we know today is far more than we knew 20 years ago. Compared with medieval scholars we are all super-scholars. To borrow a phrase: If they are humans we are like angels. If we are humans they are like donkeys. Compared with the ancients we might even know more than they thought God knew! If one of us would travel back to the time of the ancients I am certain that person would be considered a God. This system encourages people to cast skepticism towards science. It causes people to doubt things that can be proved. It does not increase critical thinking. In short, it makes people less sophisticated, not more sophisticated.</p>
<p>The gaps are shrinking. Is God shrinking too?</p>
<p>It does not have to be this way. Maimonides wrote that God is seen in observable phenomena. The <em>more</em> we know about our physical world, the <em>more</em> we can appreciate the greatness of God. This is the opposite of the God of the Gaps. It is the God of Everything. Superstition and religion have nothing to do with each other. One is an attempt to explain things that we can&#8217;t understand. The other is an attribution of everything &#8211; things that we do understand and things that we don&#8217;t understand. In this view, there is no need to add superstitions or be sketical of science. As we discover more and learn new things, we can appreciate and even come to love God more and more. <em>(And don&#8217;t worry, science will never be able to prove that God doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s impossible.)</em> This system encourages progress because more knowledge is not be feared as an antidote to God. This benefits everyone.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day we will know even more about pregnancy and superstitions will become superfluous. We don&#8217;t need the mystery of pregnancy to find and see God. Marvel in its complexity and the &#8220;miracle&#8221; of child-birth. It&#8217;s not what we don&#8217;t know. It is what we do know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/power-balance1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3609" title="power balance" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/power-balance1.png" alt="" width="400" height="167" /></a>A few famous athletes wear Power Balance wrist bands on their wrists. Power Balance sells all kinds of products that are supposed to &#8220;react to the natural flow of the body&#8221; and increase athletic performance. How does this magic work? There is a special hologram that is on the wrist band or necklace which somehow does the magic.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.accc.gov.au/">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</a> conducted a study and found that the holograms do absolutely nothing. Shocking. Right?<span id="more-3607"></span></p>
<p>The company has fired back saying that they believe in their product and despite the claims of the scientists at the ACCC, many people believe in their product&#8217;s effectiveness.</p>
<p>I heard on the radio that the way they market their product is by pulling you very powerfully by the arm, you fall over, then they put on the bracelet and pull you again, this time much less powerfully, you don&#8217;t fall over and you are to conclude that the hologram really makes you stronger. (At least this was how it was described by Petros and Money who were subjected to this test.)</p>
<p>People are always looking for a quick fix. There are no shortcuts in life. If you want results you need to do the work. Holograms don&#8217;t make you stronger. Wrist bands and amulets don&#8217;t make you stronger either.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that these types of products are reminiscent of amulets and charms of the past. Usually associated with religion, these items were thought to bring luck or even the favor of God. The Torah prohibits these practices. Although tricksters have been fooling Jews and others into buying their miracle items despite the exhortations of the Torah. Now that religious miracles are not as reliable as they were in the past (read: frauds are more easily exposed), the snake oil salesmen have moved to athletes looking to gain an edge.</p>
<p>Reading stuff like this makes me a proud skeptic.</p>

<p>A very interesting news item came my way today.</p>
<p>Last Friday night, The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Hoops-Spiritual-Lessons-Hardwood/dp/1401308813/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1263853197&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Zen Master, Phil Jackson</a>, Head Coach of the Los Angeles Lakers Head Coach, was asked about the Los Angeles Clippers. It seems that the Clippers are cursed.</p>
<p>A near perpetual resident of the cellar in the NBA standings, the Clippers have been blessed with plenty of very high draft choices. In the NBA high draft choices are the best way to build a team. The problem for the Clippers has been their draft selections have been huge busts. Some were plagued by injury, some ended up as NBA role players and others were just terrible choices.</p>
<p>Last week the latest Clippers draft pick, selected first overall, Blake Griffin underwent season ending surgery after sitting out the first half of the season hoping to get into playing shape.</p>
<p>So, the media asked Phil Jackson: Do you believe in curses?.</p>
<p>Phil&#8217;s response?</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="more-2043"></span></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/12335/phil-jackson-no-clipper-curse-just-donald-karma" target="_blank">As reported by J. A. Adande on the Truehoop blog:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Jackson said before the Lakers played the Clippers Friday night. &#8220;I&#8217;m of that generation that believes in karma. I do think there is karma in effect, ultimately. But I can&#8217;t proclaim anybody else&#8217;s karma. That&#8217;s their own making. If you do a good mitzvah [a Jewish term for an act of kindness], maybe you can eliminate some of those things. You think Sterling&#8217;s done enough mitzvahs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another reporter replied that Sterling is a major humanitarian (at least if you believe the ads Sterling has placed in the Los Angeles Times over the years).</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, but how about all those other incidents?&#8221; Jackson said.</p>
<p>Sterling has had his share of lawsuits brought against him, most notably a civil suit that in November resulted in him having to pay a record $2.725 million to settle a suit that claimed he discriminated against African-Americans, Hispanics and families with children in the apartment buildings he owns.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So Phil doesn&#8217;t believe in curses but his does believe in Karma and the power of a mitzvah to change Karma. I think I agree. Doing good in our world creates good energy in our world. The more good energy that is created, the better things may turn out.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it is determinative, but I do think it makes a difference. Whether that is the answer to the Clippers woes I would not claim to know.</p>
<p>But what of Mr. Sterling?</p>
<p>I have two issues with Mr. Sterling.</p>
<p>1) Ads in the LA Times tooting your horn? You need to tell people how much charity you give? It may be a mitzvah to give charity, but it is no mitzvah to publicize it. In fact the highest level of charity is &#8220;matan b&#8217;seyser&#8221;, giving in secret, without anyone knowing. Mr. Sterling, you could do better than to take out expensive ads telling us how great you are. Just be great and we will figure it out on our own.</p>
<p>2)  On this Martin Luther King Day, I think it is time to call out Mr. Sterling for his discrimination against minorities. Bigots like him, prevent Dr. King&#8217;s dream from becoming a reality. A dream that I share with him. So Mr. Sterling, change your ways or risk the effect of more bad karma&#8230;</p>
<p><em>I know that love is ultimately the only answer to mankind&#8217;s problems. And I&#8217;m going to talk about it everywhere I go.</em> &#8211; Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
