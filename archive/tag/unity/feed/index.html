				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>I don&#8217;t know when or exactly how or why, but at some point in my childhood I became enamored with Martin Luther King Jr. and the speech he gave 50 years ago today. I remember that one of the first things I did on the Internet was listen to the speech. I will never forget the euphoric feeling I experienced when I heard Dr. King say <em>&#8220;&#8230;when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God&#8217;s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, &#8220;Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!&#8221;<span id="more-7585"></span></em></p>
<p>The speech influenced me greatly and I had a <a href="http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf" target="_blank">faux archive version copy of the speech</a> in my childhood desk drawer.</p>
<p>Ever since then I have shared the same dream as Dr. King.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7586" alt="GTY_MLK_march_on_washington_1963_lpl_130801_16x9_608" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GTY_MLK_march_on_washington_1963_lpl_130801_16x9_608-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Content of their character. We are getting there. It&#8217;s very hard to avoid our natural biases. It&#8217;s a lifetime effort. It&#8217;s something everyone needs to work on and Dr. King calls upon us to do just that.</p>
<p>Similarly, I urge all of us to judge ideas by the content and substance of the idea and not the value we place in the person making the statement.</p>
<p>But I have a dream that in the Jewish community we can judge one another by the content of our character and not by our affiliations and style of clothing. My dream is that we can create a global Jewish community united by far more than the things that separate us.</p>
<p>One day, all Jews, no matter their belief in God, Torah M&#8217;Sinai, or the Afterlife will work together to provide positive Jewish experiences for our communities. One day, whether we are Zionist or indifferent, liberal or conservative, Â we can form a united Jewish nation. One day, mystics and rationalists, GRAniks and chasidim will dance together. One day it won&#8217;t matter who one&#8217;s grandparents were or which town one&#8217;s family came from in Europe or &#8220;God forbid,&#8221; if they came from one of the Arab countries.</p>
<p>Dr. King&#8217;s dream resonates with all of us. It gives us hope for a better future. A future where pettiness and narcissism give way to tolerance and empathy. That is my dream.</p>
<p>How do we get there? We fight against drawing imaginary lines that only serve to divide us. We argue for the rights of those who are under-represented within our ranks. We strive to give our children every opportunity to succeed and find meaningful, joyous, passionate Judaism that is inclusive, understanding, and loving. We reach out to our ideological opponents and offer them friendship with no strings attached. We explore innovative and comprehensive solutions to our social problems instead of applying bandaids to severed limbs.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a dream. But it&#8217;s a dream I believe in strongly. It is a dream worth fighting for. It is a dream that Dr. King inspired in a little boy who grew up to be me.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, the speech echoes through my brain. It&#8217;s message cuts through the noise and sings a beautiful song of hope. Thank you Dr. King for inspiring generations of people and thank you for inspiring me with the greatest speech I have ever had the privilege to hear. On its 50th anniversary we say thank you.</p>
<p>I hope we will live to see your dream come true and all of our dreams as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>In this week&#8217;s Yated, Rabbi Birnbaum writes a pretty offensive article aimed at the modern orthodox community. In private and public correspondence the article is being heavily criticized for its many flaws.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t wish to discuss its salient points, errors, or fallacies here or anywhere else for that matter. I am not interested in debating or fighting with Yated people about the two different communities. It&#8217;s pointless and I am sick of it.</p>
<p>Instead I want to propose a solution.<span id="more-7434"></span></p>
<p>Much of the heated exchange between the yeshivish and modern orthodox communities is based on a lot of misinformation and hearsay. There is very little communication between the two groups. Rarely do the two groups work together to solve social or political issues. There are no formal forums where both communities interact in writing. Facebook is the closest thing we have to a common area for discussion and I have been blessed to host many conversations on my Facebook page where people from across the spectrum interact. But it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>In the old days we lived among one another. We shared resources. We worked together on common issues. There was a rapport. Today our respective communities are so vibrant and are thriving. We don&#8217;t need each other. We stand apart, separated by the tiniest of margins. It&#8217;s a blessing that we have become so strong as individual groups but in my mind it has caused this divide.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7435" alt="Reaching out" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/handshake.jpg" /></p>
<p>True, we disagree on a lot. We disagree about the value and power of Daas Torah. We disagree about Chazal and science. We disagree on the value of full time learning and how long it is appropriate. We disagree on the importance of fathers providing for their family. We disagree on the level of insularity. We disagree on the harms of media consumption. We disagree on Zionism. We disagree on the flexibility of some areas of halacha. We disagree on the emphasis on chumros. Yes, we disagree. But in the end, this is a minuscule fraction of what we agree upon. We agree on Torah M&#8217;Sinai. We agree on Rambam. We agree on Shulchan Aruch. We agree on R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein. We basically agree on Israel. We agree on America. We basically agree on education for children. We agree on so much.</p>
<p>Yet, as we have noted many times, when we are similar to one another we seek ways to distinguish ourselves from one another. That&#8217;s what has happened here. We&#8217;ve divided ourselves over petty matters and it&#8217;s starting to affect our midos toward each other.</p>
<p>The solution here is quite simple. People from all walks of life need to get together and talk. We need to have Shabbatons for all kinds of people to enjoy the company of one another. We need to tackle issues of common concern together. We need a formal place to talk to each other instead of about each other. I doubt Rabbi Birnbaum would have dropped his article as a comment on Ha&#8217;emtza or even on my Facebook page (although I have gotten worse). But he&#8217;s writing for Yated readers and somehow (read: the Internet) the modern orthodox community gets ahold of the article, reads it, and to them he sounds off the wall. It would be so much more productive to talk to each other rather than writing screeds on blogs or &#8220;olde tyme&#8221; blogs (newspapers) like the Yated.</p>
<p>The modern orthodox community must be able to articulate its positions from a place of strength and confidence. The yeshivish community must be able to express its positions with less bombast. Both communities must try to hear the other side. But most of all, this conversation should not be between strangers, it should be between friends.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got to figure out a way to have friends from across the spectrum of orthodox Judaism. The issues have to be personalized by the humanity of relationships.</p>
<p>If this doesn&#8217;t work and we still can&#8217;t find a way to communicate civilly and productively, I&#8217;ll try to think of something else. But in the meantime, l&#8217;maan Hashem, let&#8217;s try to do this right.</p>
<p>This is a formal invitation to engage in a round table or panel discussion on the issues that are plaguing our communities. Let&#8217;s talk to each other, not about each other.</p>
<p>I am happy to host or attend such a conversation. If you are interested, please contact me. Send this to people from both sides of this issue and let&#8217;s make it happen.</p>

<p><em>Sorry about the mini blog-cation. I think I am back.</em></p>
<p>On Friday in downtown Monsey a newly formed group of activists called Wake Up Rockland entered Rockland Kosher Supermarket, basically it&#8217;s the Pomegranate of Monsey. The group was led by a black reverend and was made up of a cross-section of non-Jews from the local community. They marched into the store, innocent frum Jews looked on, mouths agape, as the activists walked up and down the aisles looking for items to purchase.Â The store did not appreciate this gesture and they asked that the group leave.</p>
<p>The group had summoned the media to be present at the demonstration and the local paper wrote about the effort. The article seems to praise the activists and is lukewarm on the store people who were not receptive to the group.</p>
<p>Demonstrators explained that they were hoping to show the frum community that we are neighbors, they are not going anywhere, and we should try to integrate our communities a bit or at the very least try to get along.</p>
<p>I think this is a great idea. There is tension in Ramapo. There are non-Jews who are nasty to Jews and there are Jews who are nasty to non-Jews. It would be great if the two communities could somehow come together.</p>
<p>But there are a couple problems with the execution of this idea.<span id="more-7286"></span></p>
<p>First, the demonstrators seem to think that there is segregation in Ramapo. It&#8217;s not really segregation. It&#8217;s more like insularity. The frum community in Monsey wants to be insular and free from secular influences. So it&#8217;s not bigotry per se. In other words, bridging the gap is not a solution, it&#8217;s actually looked at as a problem for the frum community.</p>
<p>But more importantly, if the activists are genuine, and I have no reason to think they are not, they should work together with liaisons from the frum community to create harmony. No one wants to be surprised or forced into unity. Popping into Rockland Kosher on Friday may have worked for the cameras and for headlines, but it will not achieve the desired result unless members of the frum community participate in the decision-making and execution of ideas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really not that different than the situation in Israel with the charedim. Both situations needs insiders to make the change happen. But more importantly, the very philosophy and way of life that the charedim in Israel and Monsey live makes it nearly impossible to foster integration with non-charedim.</p>
<p>This kind of worldview is becoming more and more archaic and anachronistic. The world is less tolerant of insularity and isolation. The world desires integration, mutual respect, and harmony. The challenge for charedim will be how this approach to a global community can be reconciled with insularity, if it can at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><i><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/torah_study.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7237" alt="torah_study" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/torah_study-300x223.jpg" width="300" height="223" /></a>âConcerning this it is told in the account of the Wars of the Lord, &#8220;What He gave at the [Sea of] Reeds and the streams of Arnon.â &#8211; Numbers 21:14</i></p>
<p>The Torah connects the miracles at the Sea of Reeds with the miracles at the streams of Arnon. We are very familiar with the splitting of the sea and the drowning of the Egyptians as the waves crashed down upon them. At the streams of Arnon, Amonites and Moabites were waiting for the Israelites and planned to ambush them. G-D saved the Israelites by crushing the soldiers lying in wait with the mountains they were using for cover. The twin peaks merged together destroying the people lying in wait. The verse tell us that these fantastic miracles are recorded in the book of the Wars of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Hebrew words for âwhat He gave at [the Sea of] Reedsâ are âet vahev bâSufa.â In the Talmud, our Sages ask what <i>drasha </i>we can learn from the words in Psalms (127) âet oyvim bâshaar &#8211; the enemies at the gates?â The Talmud answers in name of Râ Chiya bar Abba that even a father and son or a teacher and student that study Torah in one gateway become enemies when they argue about the Torah and they do not budge from their position until they love one another, as the verse says âet vahev bâSufa.â Rashi explains that the Talmud is referencing the mention of the book of the Wars of the Lord and is playing on the word vahev which is similar to the word ahava &#8211; love, and is saying that the battles of Torah (the Wars of the Lord) end in love.</p>
<p>Râ Schwab asks the obvious question here. This is a very farfetched <i>drasha.</i> What possible connection could there be between the splitting of the seas, the crushing of potential ambushers by way of mountains, and the intense study of Torah with a partner?<span id="more-7236"></span></p>
<p>We can understand the teaching of the Talmud if we examine the true nature of the miracles being referenced here. There were several miracles at the Sea of Reeds, but the miracle recognized here is the demise of the Egyptians in the raging waters of the sea. The waters split for the sake of the Israelites. It was a necessary measure to save the Israelites from certain death. Once the danger passed there was no longer a need for the miracle and the miraculous forces that were keeping a dry path in the sea stopped holding the waters back. As soon as there was no force splitting the sea, the waters returned to their natural, original position and the Egyptians drowned in the crashing waters.</p>
<p>Similarly, the miracle at Nachal Arnon was the merging of two mountains to crush the enemy. In essence, says Râ Schwab, the two mountains were really one mountain with two peaks. They were supposed to be one mountain but were only two peaks for the sake of giving a path for the Israelites to pass. To crush the would-be ambush all that was required was a suspension of the miracles separating the two peaks. Once the force keeping the mountain in two parts stopped, the mountain naturally crushed the ambush.</p>
<p>When fathers and sons or teachers and students study Torah they become enemies. They take different positions on matters of great importance. They disagree on the correct understanding, message, or interpretation. They argue for their point of view and fight for their position. It looks like there is a legitimate war. But the truth is that this schism is a mirage. Their true status is a state of peace and love. Itâs just that through arguing in the Battles of Torah they take positions that are at odds. Love is their natural position.</p>
<p>The Talmud is saying that the same way the waves crashing on the Egyptians and the mountains crushing the ambushers was the previously held unnatural state returning to its natural state, âet vahev bâSufaâ can refer to the natural state of love between opponents in the Battles of the Torah. Even though they appear to be at odds, they are really only temporarily arguing. Their true state is peace, love, and harmony. The <i>drasha </i>is not so farfetched after all.</p>
<p>Never in the history of the Jewish people have so many people had the opportunity to hear so many different perspectives and ideas about Judaism. Hundreds and thousands of years ago, people were exposed only to the small group of people they knew personally. Eventually, books were published with slight variances of tradition and thought but generally speaking, people knew what they knew and they did what they did. Our modern society has opened the floodgates of information. This is a great blessing. We have access to more Torah than we ever had before. But we must now contend with many more competing views of religion in general, Judaism, and Orthodox Judaism. As a group we have a lot of opinions and we are passionate about our ideas.</p>
<p>Sometimes the discussions and disagreements can get heated. After all, it is the Battle of the Torah otherwise known as the Wars of the Lord! There is so much at stake and there is so much to learn and to discuss. We all have opportunities to hear new ideas and learn from others. We also have a chance to share our perspectives and opinions. This is wonderful. But we cannot forget that despite our differences, they are only superficial. Disagreement is not our natural state. Our arguments are only for the sake of Torah and G-D. We must be sure that when our arguments end we find ourselves in our natural state of peace, love, and harmony.</p>
<p>What a poignant thought for our generation. In a world of international discussion and debate via the Internet we can never forget that when our learning is over we leave the conversation with the love of a father to a son. Certainly, in our face to face interactions, Shabbos table discussions, coffee room shmoozing, and of course learning in the Beis Medrash we always remember that it ends in our natural state of love and affection toward each other. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mount_sinai_2_2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7095 alignleft" alt="mount_sinai_2_2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mount_sinai_2_2.jpg" width="312" height="258" /></a>Shavuos is upon us. In our times, the holiday is celebrated as the time we received the Holy Torah at Mount Sinai. The day is a day of Torah. Many have the custom to learn through the night in anticipation of the morning which we commemorate the revelation at Sinai. Extended Torah study is an excellent way to celebrate Shavuos.</p>
<p>To me, the most poignant element of <em>ma&#8217;amad Har Sinai</em> comes before the revelation. The Torah tells us that the Jewish people camped around the mountain. The world used to describe this encampment is the word <em>va&#8217;yichan</em>. We would expect that the word would be <em>va&#8217;yichanu</em>, in the plural tense. Instead we get<em> va&#8217;yichan</em>, in the singular tense. Rashi quotes the famous Midrashic interpretation that the Jewish people were united as one in their preparation for receiving the Torah. Since the people were &#8220;one&#8221; the Torah uses a singular tense to describe their encampment.</p>
<p>The message is loud and clear. We are being told that there can be no <em>matan Torah</em> without unity.<span id="more-7094"></span></p>
<p>Thus, every year we hope to renew our covenant with God and Torah on Shavuos, but first we must fulfill the prerequisite of unity to have a chance at accepting the Torah.</p>
<p>In addition to our unity, it seems there was a unity of nature and supernature at the same time. <em>Chazal</em> tell us that the birds stopped chirping, the animals were quiet, even the Angels were silent. The seas were calm, people all over the word held their tongues. The entire world was waiting in absolute unity for God to share the Torah with the world.</p>
<p>To me, universal silence represents each person, each being, each element of nature listening as it were, to the word of God. When we are talking, when we are active, when we are not silent, we are unable to hear anything from the outside. In order to listen, in order to hear, we need to be silent.</p>
<p>In order to achieve true unity and to accept the Torah we need to be silent. We need to hear what is being said. We need to open our eyes and open our hearts to connect with one another and become one.</p>
<p>Unity means different things to different people. Some people think it means that we all need to agree. Some people think it means tolerance of others and acceptance of those who are within a certain accepted boundary. Some people think it must include everyone, even those you believe are truly evil or wrong.</p>
<p>To me, unity means listening to everyone. It means giving everyone an opportunity to be heard, even our opponents. Unity means trying to find common ground and focus on the things we can agree upon. It means choosing our battles wisely so that we can create positive feelings toward one another.</p>
<p>We have been through a lot over the last few weeks and months as a nation. Sometimes we get contentious toward one another. Often our disagreements are passionate and can get heated. We are all trying to do what is right.</p>
<p>As we approach Shavuos it is incumbent upon us to emulate our forefathers and come together as one in preparation of renewing our relationship to God and the Torah. We also must practice effective silence. We need to listen to one another. We need to hear each other. We need to create opportunities for dialogue and conversation.</p>
<p>We all want to merit the crown of Torah. Let us take these lessons and make them a part of our collective lives. Let us find the strength of unity and silence and we will find a Torah that connects us all to one another and to the Almighty.</p>
<p>Happy Shavuos</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayetze<br />
The Ropes That Pull Us Together</h2>
<p>As we begin to see the emergence of Yaakov Avinu as the father of the <em>shivtei ka </em>we cannot help but notice the many nuanced messages and symbolism the Torah shares with us. One such <em>yesod</em> is found in the encounter of Yitzchok Avinu at the famous well outside of Charan.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that Yaakov Avinu arrived at Charan after his harrowing journey in flight from his brother. As he arrived he finds himself at the <em>beâer basadeh</em>. There the famous tale of his encounter with Rochel Imeinu is recorded. Chazal wonder what is to be learned from the fact that it is a <em>beâer basadeh</em>, a well in the field, which defines Yaakov Avinuâs arrival into <em>golus</em>.</p>
<p>Midrashim are filled with symbolic messages explaining the representations of this <em>beâer</em>, the <em>edrei tzon</em> and the large stone which sealed and provided access to the water source of the community. The Malbim provides us a most meaningful <em>mehalach </em>so relevant to us today.<span id="more-6505"></span></p>
<p>In his approach the Malbim explains that the<em> beâer </em>represents the <em>mekor mayim chayim</em>. It reflects the<em> hashpaas</em> Hashem, His goodness and bountiful blessings that give us the proverbial hug from the Borei Olam. In a word, the Beâer represents the Shechina and how it fills our lives with all of His blessings. The symbolism is powerful.</p>
<p>The Malbim points out that as Yaakov was now in <em>golus</em> the Shechina came with him, indeed the <em>beâer</em> was <em>basadeh</em>, in the field outside of Eretz Yisrael. However, when Klal Yisrael is living in their homeland with the close access to the Shechina the Bais Hamikdash provides we will find the <em>beâer bisoch haâer</em>, in the very heart of the city. Nevertheless, while residing in <em>golus </em>it is our vital task to bring that <em>beâer</em> and the spiritual nourishment it represents from the <em>sadeh</em> into our home.</p>
<p>Just how does one bring the sanctity and warmth of the <em>beâer</em> into their home? The Malbim again draws on the words of Chazal and teaches that Reb Yehoshua taught his students that the way to harness the power of the <em>beâer</em> and pull it from the <em>sadeh</em> into the city is by fashioning <em>chavalim min hasubim</em> and through that be <em>machzeer Shechinaso leTziyon</em>. Strands braided from the leftover and unwanted fibers can be spun and twisted into powerful ropes, attached to the well and used to <em>shlep</em> it into the heart of the city. The ropes the Malbim describes represent the spinning and twisting together of Klal Yisrael from many fragments (even discarded ones) into one cord of strength as Yidden from all walks of life come together to accomplish the seemingly impossible.</p>
<p>The message is clear. If we want to bring the Shechina into our city, our community and our home we need strong ropes of <em>achdus</em> to pull together and bring the <em>beâer </em>closer and provide us the spiritual refreshment the <em>hashpaas haShechina </em>bestows. Only through <em>achdus</em> can we truly fare well.</p>
<p>This is no small feat.</p>
<p>Too often we stand apart rather then building on what we have in common. However, we must find a way to wrap ourselves around our common heartfelt <em>emuna</em> and the inner goodness of each Jew to braid a cord of unity and strength with which to connect to the Shechina and bring it home. This, Chazal teach us, is the formula for extricating ourselves from the morass of <em>golus</em>. It is not enough to seek spirituality. We must pull it inward. We cannot do it ourselves &#8211; we need every fiber of Jewry to pull together as one strong cord of strength. By doing so we can hope to fill our lives with His love and bring the <em>beâer </em>into our homes and thereby bring our homes to the ultimate <em>mikor</em> of <em>kedusha</em> in Yerushalayim Ir Hakodesh<br />
<em>bimheira biyameinu</em>.</p>

One particularly devastated area was the Seagate neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Seagate is a orthodox Jewish neighborhood. Many people living there are in basement apartments compounding the effect of the storm.</p>
<p>A massive effort was coordinated to try assist in the clean up of the neighborhood. Jews from all over the east coast (and I am sure some from further away too) organized a huge volunteer network and despite all their great work, much more work still needs to be done.</p>
<p>A very touching video has been produced that depicts a small sliver of the kindness amidst the destruction.</p>
<p>It is hard to watch and even harder not to feel a strong tug of emotions as you watch. The confluence of devastation in people&#8217;s homes and the outpouring of support from the community is quite moving. Equally impressive is the potpourri of Jews who came to help. You&#8217;ll see all shapes, sizes, and colors of orthodox Jewish men in the video. It is powerful to see the unity displayed for the sake of this relief effort. It was also cool to see my brother in law doing work in the video. Shkoyach!</p>
<p>Great job by Aryeh Gelbard of Studio 7 producing this video. Thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TheUnionisDissolved.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6466" title="TheUnionisDissolved" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TheUnionisDissolved-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" /></a>If your candidate loses the election you have three choices. You can grin and bear it, move to another country, or secede from the Union. I have not heard of anyone actually getting up and leaving the United States of America in the wake of the election, and I am sure if someone does leave purely for political reasons we will hear about it. Though I wonder where a libertarian of conservative would enjoy living more than in these United States. Is there a country out there with more conservative / liberal balance than America? I don&#8217;t think so. But I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Of course, this is part of the blessing of America. There is always a balance. There are some states that are more liberal than others. There are some states with more conservative values than others. Put it all together and you get an odd mix of values, opinions, and policies that create a great country unlike any other.</p>
<p>The White House has a petition website where one can petition the government for just about anything. If you get 25,000 signatures on your petition, the government guarantees a response. There are now 20 petitions from 20 states requesting that the Federal government allow them to peacefully secede from the United States of America so that they can form their own little country.<span id="more-6465"></span></p>
<p>Aside from the logistical problems of turning a state into a country and the oft ignored fact that the Federal government gives millions of dollars to the states, conservatives and liberals would be wise to oppose these shenanigans.</p>
<p>First of all, asking to secede after losing an election is the very definition of being a sore loser. It&#8217;s like the kid who takes his ball home after his team loses and doesn&#8217;t let the next team play.</p>
<p>But it is much more than that. Part of what America great is the diversity of its population. We are a nation of immigrants and though we Americans do not share a common ancestry or heritage we share common dreams. We pride ourselves on the great opportunity that awaits the huddled masses from wherever they come.</p>
<p>One of the great checks and balances built into our country is the political system where conservatives and liberals and everyone in between has a voice in government and ideally our government represents the best of both sides of the spectrum.</p>
<p>It would be a disaster if our country lost its great diversity and political balance due to secession. Now I know that these petitions are silly and reactionary. But I just think that if we would appreciate our country for what it is, we would not see attempts to secede after losing an election. We need to be proud of our system and if we want to change things but have been rebuffed we need to adjust strategy or tactics, not take our ball and run away.</p>
<p>I feel the same way about Jewish institutions. The Jewish people are also a nation of immigrants and huddled masses. Although in contrast to America, we do share common ancestry and heritage which makes us even more connected to one another. Part of what makes us great is our diversity. We are proud that there are so many different kinds of Jews. People to the left of us and people to the right of us may disagree on substance and style, but we are still brothers and sisters. For that reason alone we must do everything we can to identify with one another. We cannot afford secessions. Debate, dispute, disagreement, dialogue &#8211; those we can handle. But we cannot tolerate a group seceding from Judaism nor can we ostracize a group so much that we create a secession by default.</p>
<p>Our differences are our strength.Â It&#8217;s not easy to understand or empathize with people on the opposite of an ideology. But it is the sign of strength, not weakness, when we do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/8178.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6228" title="8178" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/8178.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="202" /></a>I won&#8217;t ruin it for you, but Avital Chizhik has hit another home run in her latest article. This time she has been published by the NY Times in their Opinionator Blog.</p>
<p>The article teaches an important lesson in tolerance. We tend to focus on our differences. I know I am certainly guilty of this. Everyone is guilty of it. The best tool in our arsenal of building tolerance and creating bridges is to focus on our similarities. When we see other people who look so different or who affiliate themselves so differently, we tend to zone in on those stark differences.</p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t it true that we are much more alike than we are different?<span id="more-6227"></span></p>
<p>With fellow Jews, we share much more than we realize sometimes. Often the people we like least are the people that are closest to us ideologically. But that is not a reason to hate someone else. That should be a ton of reasons to like someone else.</p>
<p>With members of other faiths we also share so much. Sure we disagree on some things, but overall we agree on a lot. This is the key to interfaith relations.</p>
<p>With secular people we share so much. Sure we disagree on a few big name items, but we agree on many things. If we can focus on the things upon which we agree, a lot of the anger and disdain will fall away. There is absolutely no reason that religious and secular people cannot work together on projects and ideas that are compatible with our mutually held beliefs.</p>
<p>The 20th century and the early 21st century brought strong feelings of nationalism. As the world shrunk, people needed to self identify more strongly with their ethnicity or religion. People were introduced to new cultures and ways of life that they never new existing. It created existential angst. In response, people retreated to their more tribal instincts as they needed a way to set themselves apart. The world suffered through several wars as a result of this nationalism and exclusionary philosophy.</p>
<p>Yet, the world continued to shrink and people continue to create imaginary lines between themselves and others as a defense mechanism to the world shrinking. It doesn&#8217;t make us stronger as individuals. It does not make our communities or religious groups stronger. It does not make society stronger.</p>
<p>Weakening our ties to each other weakens the human race in every possible way. The first step to making things right is recognizing what is highlighted in this article.</p>
<p>Go read it. Then take its lesson to heart.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Haredi-Secular.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6127" title="Haredi-Secular" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Haredi-Secular-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160" /></a>This week&#8217;s Time Magazine features a cover story on Jerusalem. Although, it is not an article about the BBC pretending that Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel, nor is it an article about East Jerusalem Arabs trying to attain Israeli citizenship. The article is about the cultural war and the turf war between secular Jews and ultra-orthodox / charedi Jews in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The focus of the article is on one &#8220;mixed&#8221; neighborhood where the charedi presence has significantly increased as the secular presence has decreased. Although the article is talking about a few individuals, the behavior described in the article can best be described as juvenile. Both sides have their villains, and in their attempt to gain control over the neighborhood both sides play pranks, vandalize, intimidate, and in general refuse to communicate.<span id="more-6124"></span></p>
<p>Sure, the article makes some technical mistakes and some incorrect assumptions, but I don&#8217;t really care about that. What I do care about is how the sad truth that in today&#8217;s society some Jews can&#8217;t figure out how to get along with each other unless the other person is just like them. That story is a story being repeated over and over again in many communities around the world.</p>
<p>Our schools and shuls are becoming more and more monolithic, our attitude toward the outside is becoming less and less tolerant, and what we are willing to do and sacrifice is becoming greater and greater for the sake of insularity. I find this trend disturbing on many levels. But the situation in Israel demonstrates to a certain degree the logical conclusion to this cycle.</p>
<p>It is a very sad state of affairs when we cannot even live happily amongst Jews. I don&#8217;t excuse the secular guerrilla warfare exposed in Time Magazine such as cutting eruv wires or slapping nude posters on synagogue walls. That is disgraceful behavior. But I also don&#8217;t excuse bullying people out of their homes or enforcing tznius standards on non-religious people.</p>
<p>If all the energy that is being used to outsmart and outwit the other side was used to figuring out how to live together, all the problems would certainly be solved. But it&#8217;s not even an option anymore. The baseline standard is to live apart from one another. I find this very sad.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that Time Magazine is a particularly good venue for this discussion, but it is a discussion that must take place. Is the goal to have a city like Jerusalem completely charedi? Is that what we are striving for? Is that what God wants from us? Will that city be a place that we can all be proud of? Is it moral to impose our religious standards on others?</p>
<p>Honestly, I can&#8217;t answer those questions with any sense of certainty. But those who are answering those questions with certainty, and are trying take control of Jerusalem or any other place in a similar situation, need to have satisfactory answers to those questions. If there is anything that this long dark exile has taught us, it is that being a minority can be very difficult. Especially when the ruling class has ideological differences with the minority. But have we only learned how to be an oppressive majority? Or are we capable of running a free, open society where orthodox Judaism can thrive alongside other ways of life?</p>
<p>I fear that the orthodox Jews who want to create orthodox Jewish cities are struggling with this. We know how to survive very well when others are in charge. Can we meet the challenge of autonomy without creating the same problems for others that we suffered throughout this exile?</p>
<p>I understand that the fear of charedi rule is mostly a fear of extremists. But the extremists are no longer so extreme. The basic standards of life in the charedi world may have been considered extreme 40 or 50 years ago. But now they are standards. Clearly, things are moving in a certain direction. The voice of moderation needs to be heard and the extremists must be silenced. If we do that, we have a chance at creating a united Jerusalem and other other towns, villages and cities as well, that are dominantly charedi but welcoming to all.</p>
<p>If we fail, I can foresee a time where non-charedim, like regular American orthodox Jews, won&#8217;t be welcome in our holiest of places because of our more moderate standards. Imagine waiting 2000 years to return to Jerusalem, only to be denied by our own brothers (and sisters). That would be a tragedy that we must avert.</p>
<p>Thank you Time Magazine for starting the conversation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mysiyum-stadium.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6089" title="mysiyum-stadium" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mysiyum-stadium-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" /></a>The 12th Siyum HaShas will take place on August 1, 2012. The event is a massive spectacle and the orthodox Jewish community is on display. The Olympics come every 4 years. The Siyum HaShas comes around once every 7 and half years. This is a huge opportunity for positive Jewish media coverage and a chance to inspire the world.</p>
<p>Agudath Israel of America does an excellent job preparing and managing the siyum. It is easy to quibble or complain about a project of this magnitude, but overall they do a really good job.</p>
<p>Rabbis Frand and Lau are the featured speakers and they are excellent choices. These keynote speakers are moderates. That just means that the right wingers think they are too left wing and the left wingers think they are too right wing. In my opinion that is a good decision as opposed to trying to find one representative from each micro-subsection of orthodox Judaism.<span id="more-6087"></span></p>
<p>One only need look to the cornucopia of Siyum HaShas&#8217; in Israel to see how difficult Agudah&#8217;s job is and that they have been by and large successful. In Israel there are many, many siyums and most of them are sect-centric. Meaning, the attendees are mostly monolithic and &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t dare go to the other siyums&#8221;. (See the article in Haaretz linked below.) The plain fact is that in America almost all orthodox Jews go to one siyum or they join is via a satellite siyum. But it is all in the spirit of unity.</p>
<p>This is the greatest feature of Daf Yomi. The beauty of Daf Yomi is that wherever one goes, there are Jews studying the same part of the Talmud. The Torah is our most important asset as a people and Daf Yomi assists the Torah as a unifying banner under which we all pledge allegiance. It is fitting that the siyum be almost as universal as possible, bringing together the best feature of Daf Yomi and the beauty of Torah.</p>
<p>I am proud to be attending my third Siyum HaShas. One of my grandfathers took me when I was 9 years old to the siyum and my other grandfather met us there and bought me my first Gemara. Seven and a half years later I attended my second siyum with my grandfather. I was unable to attend the next siyum, but this year I will be attending. More importantly, my nine year old son will be attending his first siyum as well. My father, his grandfather, will be taking him and his other grandfather will be there as well. It comes full circle.</p>
<p>This really represents what the siyum is all about. Torah is transmitted from father to son and sometimes from grandfather to grandson as well. The siyum is not just a celebration for the dedicated daf yomi participants. It is also a monument of our dedication to Torah and Torah study. The sheer numbers of participants and the diversity of the participants is inspiring and gives us all hope for our future.</p>
<p>Many people are inspired to attempt to join daf yomi with the start of a new cycle. The siyum, a celebration of completion, somehow inspires people to redouble their efforts toward their own Talmud study. I too am inspired by the siyum and the multitude of people celebrating their personal seven and a half year journey at the siyum. I am inspired by praying with 90,000 people in one venue. I am inspired by the everyday people who have taken part in this cosmic adventure. I look forward to being present at the siyum. I look forward to celebrating with the thousands of people finishing the entire Talmud for the first or for the fiftieth time.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Agudah for doing their best to keep the celebration as universal as possible. To those who are boycotting the siyum I say, you are on the wrong side of this issue. Torah unifies us and if we are unable to come together to celebrate Torah, there is a very deep problem with your approach to Torah and Judaism. We need to unite over things we agree upon, not look with a magnifying glass to find things we disagree upon.</p>
<p>The siyum will be glorious and the people it inspires will make it worth it and then some. Let&#8217;s come together and savor this wonderful moment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/godhatesnoone1_custom.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5623" title="godhatesnoone1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/godhatesnoone1_custom.jpg" alt="" width="418" height="187" /></a>All religions that I know of claim to be religions of love. Their Gods might be vengeful or strict, but God always acts of love and concern. This is much in the same way we envision a parent disciplining a child. Despite harsh rhetoric or punishment, the parent loves the child.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, religious people are not alway so loving. Some hate others and use their religious beliefs as an excuse or justification for their hatred.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most hateful religious group is the Westboro Baptist Church. They take hate to a whole new level. Not only do they hate. They make the claim that God hates. This is despite the fact that I don&#8217;t believe there is a place is Scripture that they can cite to show that God hates the people they hate.</p>
<p>An adorable nine year old boy who lives in Topeka, Kansas &#8211; home of the Westboro Baptist Church, took matters into his own hands. He made a perfect protest. He took his pencil and a small notepad and wrote his slogan in big bold letters: God Hates No One. I have a nine year old son. I could totally see him doing the same thing.</p>
<p>The kids gets it.</p>
<p><span id="more-5622"></span></p>
<p> Religion is useful when it helps people come together and live better lives. But when the only vocal message of a religious group is hate and exclusion, the religion has outlived its utility. The starting point and ending point of all religious discussion must be &#8220;God Hates No One&#8221;.</p>
<p>As the Jewish people prepare for another celebration of the revelation at Sinai and the communication of the Torah from God to human, we cannot forget that we are all God&#8217;s children. Whatever divisions we may have based on interpretation and priorities are most likely invisible to God. We are his children and our petty sibling rivalries are of little consequence God&#8217;s infinite existence.</p>
<p>It has been a contentious few weeks. At Sinai we were present &#8220;like one person, with one heart&#8221;. Let us take a time out from our quarrels, quibbles, questions, and squabbles to come together to a virtual Sinai. That&#8217;s the way God should see us. A nation of unity.</p>
<p>Now it is time for us to see ourselves the same way.</p>
<p>Wishing everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, an inspiring, meaningful, and happy Shavuos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5100" title="51CKG07JF5L._SS500_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/51CKG07JF5L._SS500_-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Menachem Kellner is a scholar par excellence. I enjoy his books, and other writings very much. One book that I particularly enjoyed was the provocatively titled: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a></p>
<p>The book is not really about what the title implies. Instead, the book is an analysis of required beliefs in Judaism. It is an excellent book and a joy to read. I heartily recommend the book to anyone interested in the evolution of fundamental beliefs in Judaism.</p>
<p>One important issue that is thoroughly discussed is the importance the Sages of the Mishna and Talmud placed on actions while placing less importance on faith or beliefs. This is true. But the significance of this fact is debatable. That is because faith or belief in a deity was a basic assumption of life in the era in which the Sages lived. One had to be insane to be an atheist 2000 years ago. How would one even begin to explain the world in which they lived. However, today one can certainly be sane and deny the existence of God. In fact, some might argue that the tables have turned and belief in God is the less sane position. After all, there is no scientific proof of an all-knowing, all-powerful Creator. So, while I enjoyed the discussion in the book about actions having more meaning than beliefs in the eyes of the Sages, how well that transfers to modern times is another discussion entirely.</p>
<p>Another core point of the book is that in adopting the 13 Fundamental Beliefs of Maimonides there is an odd irony.<span id="more-5099"></span> On the one hand, Maimonides the Rationalist lost. By this I mean that Judaism today is mostly not the Judaism of Maimonides. Today&#8217;s Judaism is dominated by metaphysics, mysticism, and Zohar-centric Kabbalah. The Judaism of Maimonides functioned without Â these elements. (For a thorough analysis and discussion of this point see Kellner&#8217;s book:Â <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906764158">Maimonides&#8217; Confrontation with Mysticism</a>.) So Maimonides lost. He tried to establish a Judaism free from these non-essential elements but he failed. The public rejected his approach.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the public embraced the revolutionary suggestion of Maimonides that there are 13 fundamental beliefs and what those beliefs actually entail. There were other fundamental belief systems proposed by others and Judaism may have got along just fine without a formal expression of fundamental beliefs.</p>
<p>Yet, here we are today. The public has rejected rationalism and embraced fundamental beliefs. Isn&#8217;t it ironic?</p>
<p>The final part of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a>Â is a polemic. Kellner argues that it should be okay to relegate the 13 Fundamental Beliefs for the sake of Jewish Unity. His proposal is based on the assumption that Orthodox Jewish rabbis and non-rabbis avoid working with non-orthodox rabbis and non-rabbis. There is no conversation or joint agenda in which orthodox and non-orthodox JewsÂ Â participate. Further, Kellner assumes that this plain fact is because of the halachic prohibition that proscribes a believer from engaging with a heretic. The logic follows that since by the lights of the 13 Fundamental Principles there is a presumption that non-orthodox Jews are technically heretics. Hence, it is forbidden to engage them. This, according to Kellner is the reason there is no communication between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews. Kellner then argues that for the sake of unity, continuity, and peace we should discard with a highly literal usage of Maimonides fundamental beliefs and open the lines of communication with non-orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>One might suspect that I would agree with Kellner on this matter. In principle I do. I wrote about it here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/21/there-is-no-tent/">There is No Tent</a>.Â I think we should increase communication and interaction with all Jews. But I don&#8217;t agree with Kellner&#8217;s logic here. Not at all.</p>
<p>The reason there is little interaction between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews has very little to do with halacha. It has a lot to do with social concerns. The orthodox establishment is more concerned with their children and keeping their children orthodox than the nitty-gritty of whether or not it is permissible to engage with the non-orthodox. In other words, the real reason there is little interaction between the groups is because the orthodox are concerned about the influence that non-orthodox will have over their children or even themselves. It is a matter of insulation and isolation, not a matter of halacha.</p>
<p>And so, it makes little difference to the orthodox Jew that fundamentals of faith are a novel introduction by Maimonides or that there are other codes of faith that could be acceptable. What does matter is that access to a world of Judaism that does not follow the chain of halacha that is followed by orthodox Jews could &#8220;corrupt&#8221; orthodox Jews and they may jump ship. It is merely circling the wagons. It is not a halachic decision.</p>
<p>Therefore, Kellner&#8217;s ambitious and admirable suggestion is a non-starter. Unless the orthodox Jewish community can foster a confidence in its principles and ideals to the point that interaction is not considered a spiritual danger, I don&#8217;t foresee a change in approach. As a pure academic exercise, the recommendation ofÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a>Â is bold and exciting to me. But in a practical sense, it is lacking.</p>
<p>The only way intra-Jewish relations will change significantly is if our leadership suggests that it has value and that value trumps overzealous concerns over assimilation. I hope it does change.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest readingÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a>Â and thinking about its many fascinating points for discussion. If you have read it let me know what you think in the comments.</p>
<p><em>Buy the book on Amazon:Â <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1904113389/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1904113389">Must a Jew Believe Anything?</a></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/KolNidre.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4705" title="KolNidre" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/KolNidre-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>Tonight is Yom Kippur. Across the world, millions of Jews will usher in the solemn day of Yom Kippur with the ancient prayer of Kol Nidre.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more strange.</p>
<p>Yom Kippur is the day of repentance. Kol Nidre is a prayer that annuls our vows. That is a very unlikely way to begin Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>Yet, not only do we begin Yom Kippur with Kol Nidre we tremble when the familiar tune is chanted. Then, we end the prayer withÂ ×× ×¡×× ××× ×¢××ª ×× × ××©×¨×× ××Â ×××Â ××¢× ××©×××. &#8220;And all the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven&#8221;.</p>
<p>Why do we begin Yom Kippur with Kol Nidre and what relationship is there between the Kol Nidre prayer annulling our vows and the statement of ask for forgiveness for the congregation of Israel?<span id="more-4700"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://baltimorejewishlife.com/news/news-detail.php?SECTION_ID=1&amp;ARTICLE_ID=9918" target="_blank">Says Rabbi Frand</a>:</p>
<p>Throughout the year, many of us take on additional practices to enhance our observance. We may be stringent in various matters to protect ourselves from sin. It is possible even that we would disassociate ourselves from others as a result of our personal stringencies. It is possible we could feel an air of superiority for keeping these practices.</p>
<p>These additional practices have the status of a vow.</p>
<p>Kol Nidre annuls these vows.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to stand before God Almighty and beg for forgiveness would we be individuals at odds with our brothers and sisters. If we separate ourselves with theseÂ stringencies we stand divided before God.</p>
<p>KolÂ Nidre levels the playing field. All those stringencies are removed by the Kol Nidre prayer. One is free to re-initiate them after Yom Kippur. But on Yom Kippur we stand united. No personal preferences, stringencies and personal practices stand between us.Â Therefore, we conclude Kol Nidre with ×× ×¡×× ××× ×¢××ª ×× × ××©×¨×× ××Â ×××Â ××¢× ××©×××. The <em>entire congregation</em> can stand before God as one. We can come to God to ask for forgiveness strengthened by our unity once we get rid of whatever minor practices we may have that can divide us.</p>
<p>The key is to come together. The key is unity.</p>
<p>I mentioned in a previous post [see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/10/04/making-the-post-yom-kippur-meal-meaningful/">Making The Post Yom Kippur Meal Meaningful</a>]Â that there is no Jewish observance that is more universal than fasting and coming toÂ The Shul on the Beach Yom Kippur. Everyone [almost] does it. Aside from the beauty that we can find in our unity, it is the ultimate tool in our hands as we ask the Almighty to forgive us.</p>
<p>Let us enter this day with unity, leave it with unity as well but most importantly maintain that unity for the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/225px-Gottlieb-Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4682" title="225px-Gottlieb-Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/225px-Gottlieb-Jews_Praying_in_the_Synagogue_on_Yom_Kippur.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="291" /></a>Although many Jews celebrate Pesach and Chanukah, anecdotally, I think the most universal Jewish tradition is Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>Back when I was a campus rabbi at USC, even the most unaffiliated students would fast. One year, many of my students attended the USC Trojans football game in Palo Alto against Stanford on Yom Kippur. Almost all of them fasted.</p>
<p>At the Shul on the Beach, we are bursting at the seams on Yom Kippur. At least 20 minutes before Kol Nidre every seat is full. As the shofar blasts signaling the end of the holiest day of the year, there is standing room only. Every square inch of the shul is occupied by our Jewish brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Indeed, Yom Kippur brings all Jews together. I think it brings us together even more than Chanukah and Pesach because there is only one way to do Yom Kippur, at least externally. We all fast and we all come to shul. The sense of unity and camaraderie is inspiring. On other holidays, the traditions have become more fractured and diverse. Different communities, religious denominations and families celebrate so differently.</p>
<p>On Yom Kippur the observances are much more uniform. I believe Yom Kippur is the most universal Jewish tradition.</p>
<p>Where traditions veer off onto their own is the post fast meal.<span id="more-4681"></span></p>
<p>For some, the solemnity of the day carries over into the post fast meal. For others, the sheer physical toll makes the meal less of a meal and more of a struggle to restore some of their sapped energy. For others, it becomes a bit of a party and celebration; a time to socialize and connect on a personal level. My family&#8217;s tradition is to break the fast with a festive meal that is almost like a Yom Tov meal.</p>
<p>The NY Times chronicles some of these traditions in a recent article. One tradition that is gaining traction is non-orthodox circles is a post fast community or group meal.</p>
<p>I think it is important to realize that the post fast meal has great potential for growth and accomplishment as we begin anew post our Yom Kippur penance. Wasting the opportunity seems like a shame.</p>
<p>It seems that it is easy to dismiss the post Yom Kippur meal as a newfangled (read: negative) experience. A social gathering has potential for undesirable levity and frivolity. This would be disappointing after an inspiring day of spirituality. But if done the right way, I think there is merit to post fast meal.</p>
<p>Upon the completion of a powerful group experience of fasting and praying together, we can tap into the energy of those moments and use them to our advantage as relationship building experiences. I know that whenever I been part of a shared experience that has impacted the group, we connect and share a common bond that carries tremendous weight. Using the post fast moments to unite and connect with one another could be a very meaningful experience.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of many better ways to spend the nirvana-like moments after Yom Kippur.</p>

<p>The insular orthodox Jewish community in New York woke up this morning to a horrific end to a harrowing past few days. A 9 year old boy never came home from camp. A massive search ensued, uniting all types of Jews and non-Jews in an effort to find and rescue the boy. Volunteers from all over the New York Metropolitan area came to Brooklyn to assist in the search.</p>
<p>Eventually the FBI found the boy. But it was too late.<span id="more-4429"></span> He had been murdered and dismembered. A suspect, who has confessed is in custody. The suspect is, according to reports, an orthodox Jewish male may have been friends with the boy&#8217;sÂ family.</p>
<p>It is all to much to handle at this point. Even tears seem too trite under the circumstances.</p>
<p>An innocent boy has been brutally murdered.</p>
<p>The only thing to say at this point is how my heart and the hearts of every single other human being must go out for this child&#8217;s family and friends. They say there is nothing more difficult than burying a child. I can&#8217;t imagine the pain involved. But I can imagine that it is even worse under circumstances like these.</p>
<p>Let us hope that the family will find the strength to cope with this tragedy and let us give each other support through this difficult time.</p>
<p>There is a silver lining to every dark cloud. I think I have found a silver lining**, even in this case, but now is not the time to discuss silver linings. Now is the time to grieve and support.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/statue.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4391" title="statue" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/statue-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>When considering the importance of the July 4th holiday in America, it is almost impossible to overstate it. July 4th is the day it all began. It is the day that set into motion all of the wonderful things that is the United States of America.</p>
<p>Perhaps above all, the second line of the Declaration of Independence illustrates why July 4th 1776 changed the world forever.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This line has taken on a life that goes well beyond the intended meaning of this proclamation. It has become a calling card for civil rights and equality for all. It has created an environment where many religions have been able to flourish alongside seculars and humanists. It has created a country where no one can be discriminated against for their beliefs.<span id="more-4390"></span></p>
<p>In theory this is certainly a powerful sentiment. But if people are forced into non-discrimination would that create a harmonious atmosphere of different groups working together? Or would it simply protect against overt acts of violence or threats between groups?</p>
<p>In real life, it&#8217;s a mixed bag. Too often it is the latter. When it is the former it is worth noting. Especially on July 4th.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s LA Times ran an article about the LA Eruv. (What&#8217;s an Eruv? My explanation is here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/11/the-good-wife-unorthodox-from-a-rabbi-law-student-perspective/">The Good Wife: Unorthodox, From a Rabbi / Law Student Perspective</a>.)Â The LA Eruv uses the 405 Freeway for one of its walls. In case you haven&#8217;t heard, the 405 is the world&#8217;s biggest parking lot. During rush hour it can literally take an hour to travel a mile. To help relieve some of the stress on the 405, Caltrans is doing some construction.</p>
<p>The 405&#8242;s most dense corridor runs between the 10 Freeway and the 101 Freeway. That corridor will be 100% closed for TWO FULL DAYS. Los Angeles will be a traffic nightmare. (<a href="http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/06/405_freeway_closure_july_16_17_traffic_los_angeles_subway.php" target="_blank">Carmaggedon</a> &#8211; of course)</p>
<p>All the construction has also been a potential nightmare for the Eruv committee. Each project along the 405 breaks the wall and it is necessary to fill that area in with a temporary &#8220;wall&#8221; until the construction in that area is complete. Working together with Caltrans, the Eruv committee has been able to satisfy the halachic requirements for the Eruv every week during the construction.</p>
<p>But they have help. Howard Witkin, an administrator with the LA Eruv says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;The level of help we&#8217;ve had, from the Roman Catholic permit people at Caltrans â¦ to the Muslim line inspector along the freeways who gave us engineering help.â¦The level of deference and courtesy and kindness â it makes you feel good that you live in America.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Yes it does.</p>
<p>So on July 4th, we celebrate the birth of a country that enables this kind of relationship between vastly different groups with very different beliefs.</p>

<p>Plessy v. Ferguson was the landmark Supreme Court case that held that racially segregated trains were constitutional so long as they were &#8220;separate but equal&#8221;.</p>
<p>Over half a century later &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; was shown to be a fallacy and inherently, separate was not equal.</p>
<p>Something that was drilled into me during my first year of law school, primarily by Professor Dan Schechter, was to put yourself in the the shoes of the people in the case. This is a useful tool because things can become so abstract in the law that we can forget that real humans are involved in the dispute and there are real human emotions often at play.</p>
<p>This idea is particularly poignant when discussing civil rights cases.<span id="more-4339"></span></p>
<p>Plessy was a real person. Ferguson was a real person. Their names are forever linked in the controversy surrounding their case. Plessy challenged the legality of separate train cars.Ferguson upheld their legality. What Plessy did took a lot of guts. What Ferguson did did not but would we have acted differently? Their choices made a real difference in real lives. Plessy inspired a civil rights movement and Ferguson forced that movement to bide its time. Real people. Real consequences. Real history.</p>
<p>Recently, their grandchildren started a civil rights foundation. Together. They are rewriting their history from Plessy vs. Ferguson to Plessy <em>and</em> Ferguson.</p>
<p>Just beautiful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><div id="attachment_4037" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0628-500x333.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4037" title="IMG_0628-500x333" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_0628-500x333-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(rehearsal)</p></div>
<p>Last week I told you about the concert featuring Itzhak Perlman and Cantor Helfgot (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/21/the-soul-of-jewish-music-concert-in-los-angeles/">The Soul of Jewish Music Concert in Los Angeles</a>). Through a series of fortuitous events I was given a pair of excellent seats. My wife and I attended the show and it was amazing.</p>
<p>For me, it was stepping out of my comfort zone. I don&#8217;t particularly love cantorial music, nor classical music, nor klezmer music. But I can appreciate all three. I enjoy pushing the envelope of my personal tastes so I was excited at the opportunity to do just that. I recorded some parts of the concert on my phone to share with you. But unfortunately when I woke up this morning, my phone was broken. It has been replaced and those recordings are lost. Gam zu le&#8217;tova&#8230;</p>
<p>I hear they are making a CD / DVD of the event. I will likely buy that and I recommend you do the same.</p>
<p>The show opened with one of all time favorite comedians, Elon Gold. He calls himself the Jewish Jerry Seinfeld. Hilarious. I know.<span id="more-4034"></span> He only gave us a small taste of his hilarity but I have been fortunate to hear him for a full set (see:Â <a href="http://jamusc.blogspot.com/2005/04/elon-gold-and-me.html">Elon Gold and Me!</a> from six years ago). His Jewish jokes are the best I&#8217;ve ever heard and he had the entire place rolling within seconds.</p>
<p>Then the klezmer band played an opening song to get everyone warmed up. Every time I hear klezmer I wonder if I like it. It&#8217;s a strange feeling not knowing how you feel about something. But I think I like it when it&#8217;s being played, especially live, but I don&#8217;t think I would actively pursue a klezmer group of album.</p>
<p>Itzhak Perlman rolled onto the stage next to a raucous ovation. He played masterfully and I particularly enjoyed his facial expressions as he played. It is clear that the music speaks from his violin but through his very essence.</p>
<p>Eventually, Cantor Helfgot took the stage. To many in the crowd, he was an unknown. He blew everyone away. He sang with such control, such beauty and such royalty. He took people&#8217;s breath away. The people behind us had never heard him before. They could not stop gasping in astonishment, raving about his performance and cheering his big moments. The entire audience was spellbound by Helfgot&#8217;s masterful performances. I was also particularly moved by how regal he looked and held himself. Chasidic dress is supposed to look that way and Helfgot played the part perfectly.</p>
<p>The &#8220;tour guide&#8221; and conductor for the evening was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hankus_Netsky" target="_blank">Hankus Netsky</a>. He was funny, charming, informative and soulful all night and to me he was the surprise star of the show.</p>
<p>Throughout the night, various music styles were featured. We heard klezmer, chasidic and cantorial pieces all performed exquisitely. It really and truly felt like we had been transported a century or two back to the shtetl. The lyric were mostly (unapologetically) religious and the prayers and meanings of the songs were a source of pride for the performers.</p>
<p>I honestly was surprised at how much I enjoyed and how much I was amazed by the performance. Thinking back, I shouldn&#8217;t have been so surprised. Arguably, Perlman and Helfgot are the best people in the world at their craft. Any time the best does what they do, you can&#8217;t help but be impressed. It also got me thinking about what it must feel like, or be like, to be the absolute best in the world at something. I&#8217;ll never know, but it something worth thinking about.</p>
<p>One of the funniest things about the night were the glaring foibles of ashkenazik Jews on display. Self deprecating jokes, confusion about the sets, performers interrupting each other during their little talks and music sheets strewn across the stage made me laugh a little inside.</p>
<p>The highlight of the night for me had nothing to do with music. The highlight for me was spending 3 hours with a crowd that was well over 95% Jewish and representatives of almost every single kind of Jew. Most of the men were not wearing head coverings. But many were. There were rabbis of all denominations and flavors as well. Even within the orthodox Jewish contingent there was so much diversity. There were chasidic Jews, yeshivish Jews, kollel fellows, all kinds of rabbis and the full gamut of modern Orthodox Jews. Ashkenazim, Sephardim, baalei teshuva and FFBs were all in attendance. The cross section of Jewry in Los Angeles was fully represented and it made me feel so good.</p>
<p>Music has that ability. It can unite. It can connect. It can break through the imaginary barriers we place between ourselves. Perhaps that is why the evening was called the &#8220;Soul of Jewish Music&#8221;, as Jews, we all share one soul. It was easy to see that last night at the Saban Theater in Los Angeles.</p>

<h2>Parshas Shemini<br />
Tovim Hashnayim Min HaâEchad</h2>
<p>The Parsha commences with the celebration of Aharon and his sons as they ascend into the role of Kohanim for the very first time. Prepared, trained and ready to serve, they offer their first sacrifices filled with excitement and pride. While still atop the Mizbeach, The Posuk says vayisa Aharon es yadav â âAharon Hakohein lifted up his hands to bless Klal Yisraelâ. Filled with excitement and joy he turns toward Bnai Yisrael and blesses them with the words of Birchas Kohanim for the very first time. The climax of this monumental moment was to be when a heavenly fire would ignite the Mizbeach to offer an awesome revelation of the Shechina to all. But as Aharon completed the Bracha, all was  silent. Nothing happens.</p>
<p>Rashi explains how Aharon, stunned with disappointment, turned to his brother Moshe and lamented his âunworthinessâ to serve. <span id="more-3967"></span>Moshe reassured him and together they approached the Ohel Moed. Inside they offered private prayers. Then, together, the Posuk says, vayeitzu vayivarchu es haâam â âthey went forth and blessed Klal Yisraelâ. Immediately the Torah proclaims vayeireh kvod Hashem el kol haâamâ The Shechina was revealed for all to see. What changed to enable the success of this revelation?</p>
<p>&#8216;The Midrash itself provides us a clue. Says the Midrash, this episode is an example of tovim hashnayim min haâechad â âtwo are better than one.â It is a reflection of  Heinei mah tov umah naim sheves achim gam yachad. Why?</p>
<p>A fundamental maxim of dedicating the Mishkan, is the knowledge that all Jews are interdependent. A Jew is never alone. Moreover, we can never look at ourselves as being complete. We have to continue to learn and to grow from one another other. When Jews function Bâachva there is nothing that cannot be accomplished. This is the underlying message of the Chanukas Hamishkan. Aharon Hakohein was the conduit to provide this vivid reminder for us all. Indeed, we must always remember to not âgo it aloneâ. We can take this lesson with us today as we consecrate the Mikdash Meâat of our home, shul or school. With the new month of geula, Nissan, upon the horizon, our sense of Achva must guide us. The number âoneâ is reserved for Hashem Yisborach alone. Only with the power of 2 can we fully connect to the Shney Luchos Habrius â and IYâH excel bein adam laMakom ubein adam lachaveiro to build the Beis Hamikdash anew, bimhara biyameinu Amen.</p>

(<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/15/the-difference-between-murder-and-terrorism/">The Difference Between Murder and Terrorism</a>) Apparently, this was considered inappropriate by some. I was told should not be trying to have a rational, reasoned discussion about terrorism during the Shiva of a terror victim.</p>
<p>Others were aghast that my &#8220;reaction&#8221; to the tragedy was to have an intellectual discussion. This is a dumb complaint. I don&#8217;t need to have an official &#8220;reaction&#8221; before I write anything besides that official &#8220;reaction&#8221;. It should have been obvious that my &#8220;reaction&#8221; was of horror, disgust and immense sadness just like every other human being that heard about the tragedy. My post was only supposed to be supplemental to the obvious.</p>
<p>If you were offended. I am sorry.<span id="more-3926"></span></p>
<p><em>(I&#8217;m not sorry if you thought I was trivializing the act of terror or saying it wasn&#8217;t so bad or rationalizing the act itself. That&#8217;s just ridiculous. I would never and did not ever do anything like that.)</em></p>
<p>What are my non-rational thoughts on the tragedy? Words don&#8217;t do justice to my feelings. I am horrified. I am in pain. I am hurt. I wish I could fix the whole mess and make it better.</p>
<p>The Fogels are holy Jews who died al kiddush Hashem. The Rambam holds that anyone who dies for the simple reason that they are a Jew is kadosh. The Fogels are eternally kedoshim. We can only try to live our lives as kedoshim.</p>
<p>This act of terror crossed all lines. It was not an act of war or uprising. It was an act of cowardice and hate. At least 9/11 was supposedly attacking working adults. This attack on the Fogels destroyed a family and killed a wife / mother and her young children. This is a step beyond war. An invisible but obvious line has been crossed. Hopefully, it will never be crossed again.</p>
<p>As for the aftermath of the tragedy, it once again showed that despite all our differences, whether they be political, religious, ideological, superficial, meaningful, ancient or recent, the Jewish people band together when we need each other most. The unity expressed when faced with tragedy is awe inspiring. It is also a call to action to try not to wait for tragedy to express and feel that unity. We can&#8217;t wait for the Hamans and Hitlers of the world to remind us that a Jew is a Jew is a Jew no matter their beliefs or observance. We need to seek that harmony on our own.</p>
<p>I choose to mourn the Fogels by trying to inspire unity. By making the feeling of connection that every Jews has as of this very moment a permanent feeling of connection we can use this horrible tragedy as an opportunity to break the unfortunate barriers that stand between Jewish people of all stripes and colors.</p>
<p>Together we can do so much more than we can do alone. The Fogels have showed us that. Let&#8217;s make their memory a permanent blessing. <em>Yehi zichram baruch.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/germany01.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3311" title="german" src="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/germany01-284x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="210" /></a>The NY Times has a write-up on a little controversy in Germany. There are two main rabbinical seminaries in Germany. There is a &#8220;Liberal&#8221; seminary and an &#8220;Orthodox&#8221; seminary. The Orthodox seminary is the reincarnation of the Hildesheimer seminary which was founded in 1873. It has reopened as the Orthodox community has grown.</p>
<p>The controversy stems from funding that the government provides the Jewish community. The Liberal seminary is receiving funds while the Orthodox institution is not. See the article for the details.</p>
<p>There are three very interesting things I noticed in the article.<span id="more-3310"></span></p>
<p>1) Read this quote:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Hildesheimer seminary, which was founded in 1873, was forced to close in 1938 as life for Jews became intolerable underÂ Hitler.</em></p>
<p>Intolerable? Really? That&#8217;s a pretty poor word choice for &#8220;systematic extermination of all Jews in Germany&#8221;. I have no problem with current Germans or Germany or German products. I do have a problem with whitewashing the Holocaust and calling it &#8220;intolerable&#8221;.</p>
<p>2) There is a general secretary of the Central Council of Jews named Stephen Kramer. The council represents and tries to unite all Jews. In the United States, there is no central Jewish agency. Jews in America have created a ton of independent agencies but they all work independently. The CCJ in Germany works hard to unite all Jews from all denominations. There is no such agency in the United States, nor does it seem that there is any effort made to that end. I would like to see that change. We are all family, regardless of differences in theology.</p>
<p>Without a central agency, perhaps we can try on our own. That would be good.</p>
<p>3) This issue is creating a divide between Jews in Germany. The CCJ is trying hard to prevent that from happening. As Mr. Kramer says: <em>âWe need both pillars if we want to rebuild the community here. But the longer this dispute continues, the more it could force Jews to choose one side or the other. Until now, the majority of Germanyâs Jews are somewhere in between.â</em></p>
<p><em></em>It would be a shame to see the Jews of Germany become as fragmented and divided as we are in the United States. We have strength in numbers across all denominations. So in a sense we can afford to be divided. I don&#8217;t like it. It&#8217;s unfortunate, but it works.</p>
<p>However in the fledgling JewishÂ German community they need strength of unity. Hopefully the issue can be resolved soon and they can go back to working together again.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah âThoughtâ) series.</span></em></p>
<h2><span><span>Parshas</span> Noach</span></h2>
<h2>ROYGBIV</h2>
<p><span>As the <span>Ramban</span> points out, the world was blessed during the seven days of creation with the phenomena of the rainbow, a magnificent display of color. We can even see âmini-rainbowsâ as we spray water in the air on a bright sunny day. Indeed, the beautiful spectrum of light is refracted through the prismatic effect of moisture in the sky. We must wonder: why was the rainbow selected by <span>Hashem</span> <span>Yisborach</span> as the symbol of His â<span>bris</span>â to never again destroy the entire world through a catastrophic flood? What is the <span>middah</span> <span>kineged</span> <span>middah</span> connection between the flood and the <span>keshes</span> and what unique qualities can we learn from this inter-relationship.</span><span id="more-2918"></span></p>
<p><span>Our <span>Chachamim</span> point out that the ultimate flaw of the <span>dor</span> <span>hamabul</span> was their selfishness; their total disregard for their fellow man. <span>Chamas</span>, petty theft, was the straw that broke the camelâs back in a generation exhibiting every form of moral decay. Indeed, they looked at the world as a place with no limits or boundaries. An opportunity to do âwhat I want, when I want and with whom.â They no longer saw or respected the significance of the individual or the community. They had no sense of private property, personal or communal responsibility. They lost touch with their essence of having been created bâ<span>tzelem</span> <span>Elokim</span> and no longer viewed their Creator as involved in daily events. They were hopelessly lost, except for Noach. The worst aspects of human nature had consumed them.</span></p>
<p><span> Enter the rainbow. The pure, unblemished sunâs white light which warms and sustains our entire world is a seemingly boundless and unlimited source of energy. However, as it is refracted through the misty lens of the clouds we can see that the gift of light from <span>Hashem</span> is not a lack of color but a combination of it all. Through the prism we see individual bands of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet maintaining their discipline in place. Yes, the rainbow carries a unique message. Each color of the <span>keshes</span> symbolizes to us the importance and discipline of the individual performing his unique role while working together with others to combine into one. As Jews we are especially conscious of the unique individual roles we play in creating the totality of <span>Klal</span> <span>Yisrael</span>. We are men, women and children, who play different roles in the <span>klal</span> as do our <span>Kohanim</span>, Leviâ<span>im</span> and <span>Yisraelim</span>. Only by maintaining our roles and adhering to boundaries do we truly create a seemingly seamless light force. <span>Mitzvos</span> are the same. Each has its own unique spiritual hue and color. When combined by the totality of Am <span>Yisrael</span>, they form the spectacular luminance of the <span>ohr</span> <span>haganuz</span> which awaits us lâ<span>asid</span> <span>lavo</span>.</span></p>
<p>The dor hamabul thought that they would enlighten their lives by modeling the sun and its apparently boundless state of matter. They too lived life without limits.</p>
<p>They were dreadfully wrong.</p>
<p><span><span>Hashem</span> teaches us through the rainbow that just the opposite is true. Torah demands structure and discipline.  It is only within the limits and boundaries of <span>Halacha</span> that our defined mission is actualized. Through our personal and communal <span>avoda</span> we create the essence of <span>Klal</span> <span>Yisrael</span> as an <span>ohr</span> laâ<span>amim</span>, a spectacular light to all nations. And in so doing, we can generate that most brilliant light which <span>Hashem</span> <span>Yisborach</span> has stored away for our future. May we be <span>zocheh</span> to bask in its rays <span>bimharah</span> <span>biyameinu</span>. </span></p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h1>Parshas Yisro</h1>
<h1>Achdus, Emunah and Simcha</h1>
<p>The raison-dâÃªtre of maaseh braisheis and the essential tachlis of Klal Yisrael is defined in parshas Yisro with the experience of Matan Torah. No other event in world history more profoundly impacted the world for eternity.<span id="more-2113"></span> For Klal Yisrael our role as banim laHashem, of being privileged to be designated as an ohr laâamim is nestled in the achdus we shared as we proclaimed naâaseh vânishmah, Kâish echad bâlev echad. With this expression, the unity of Am Yisrael is linked forever to our acceptance of the responsibilities Hashem Yisborach was placing upon us.</p>
<p>The Midrash Tanchuma elaborates on this idea. He quotes Rebbi Hakadosh, who includes an additional ingredient in the paradigm of Matan Torah. It creates a chut Hamishulash and a message  which is so vital it must be explored. âRebbi omer, bshaâah sheâamdu Yisrael al Har Sinai hishvu kulan lev echad lâkabeil aleihem malchuchus shamayim . . . bâsimcha.â</p>
<p>The Achdus of Klal Yisrael at Sinai was not limited to our unity of acceptance of  mitzvos.  Rather, it was expanded to include the attitude of Simcha. It is simcha  which must permeate every aspect of our achdus and avodas Hashem. It is the prerequisite of Matan Torah . These three: simcha, achdus and kabbalas malchus Shamayim are the âchut hamishulashâ of our avodas Hashem. The message is that without simcha true unity is impossible; without simcha, emunah is lacking. The declaration of naâasseh vânishma is dependent on all threeâ achdus, emunah and simcha. Strengthening each of these aspects of our daily avodah can help reignite the inspiration of Sinai for us each and every day.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h1>Kol Brama Nishma â Rachelâs Voice</h1>
<p>As Yaakov Avinu prepares for his final farewell he tells Yosef Hatzaddik of the circumstances surrounding the death of his mother, Rachel Imeinu . He expresses regret for her not being buried in Maâaras Hamachpeila like the rest of the imahos. He explains that he had to bury her on the way to Bais Lechem not simply due to an immediate need for rapid interment. But more importantly, as the Navi tells us, kol brama nishma. . . Rachel mivakah al baneha, to secure her voice and passionate cries for Klal Yisrael in times of crisis in the future. <span id="more-1954"></span>Indeed, we would need her tears to help break the harsh decree of golus.</p>
<p>This posuk (Yeshaya 31:15) describing the emotion of Rachel Imeinuâs wailing sob for her children is fascinating for it seems to have a grammatical anomaly.  The Posuk tells us that Rachel is mivakah al baneha, Rachel is crying for her children. It continues meâanah lhinachem al baneha ki einenu she finds no solace or comfort for her children for they are gone. Looking closely, however, something is not right. Although Rachel is crying for baneha, her children, in the plural, the word describing their absence, einenu, is written in the singular. Read with grammatical accuracy the verse means Rachel Imeinu is crying for her children for he is gone. It should state the plural form of einam teaching us that they (her sons) are missing.</p>
<p>What is the Navi teaching us? My father aâh was fond of explaining this verse with a powerful and profound insight. Stated simply, he would say, that the Navi is teaching us that Rachel Imeinu cries for each one. Not all the Yidden, but each Yid! Mama Rachel cries for the yachid, the individual Jew, she is heartbroken for even one Yid lost. She finds no comfort in the masses of Yidden who are wholesome and frum, even one Jew lost is an inconsolable tragedy. Sadly we tend to get lost in the grouping of the tzibur and the klal, the totality of Am Yisrael. We must never forget that Bnei Yisrael is really comprised of individuals, each one a jewel. And so Rachel Imeinu cries for the one, that one yid left behind. We should too. Indeed we must!</p>
<p>Yehi ratzon that in that merit of our modeling mama Rochel with our tâfillos, concern and interest in each member of Am Yisrael, we will be zoche to the comforting words of the Navi. Vshavu banim ligvulam bimhara biyameinu amen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/15/a-powerful-film/full-20earth2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1921"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1921" title="earth" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/full-20earth2-300x300.jpg" alt="earth" width="166" height="166" /></a>This short film is a &#8220;must-see&#8221;. It is part of <a href="http://www.responsibilityproject.com/" target="_blank">Liberty Mutual&#8217;s &#8220;Responsibility Project&#8221;</a>. Watch the film all the way through the very end.</p>
<p>Call me a sap, but this film brought tears to my eyes. Real, wet, tears.</p>
<p>Which left me wondering, the film is certainly nice, but why did it elicit such a strong reaction?</p>
<p>I think two parts of the film in particular were resonsible for my emotional response.<span id="more-1915"></span></p>
<p><strong>1 </strong>- The &#8220;rules are rules&#8221; aspect of sports is something we take for granted as necessary elements for a game. On the other hand, we resist rules in our real lives. We don&#8217;t want to be tied down by restrictions, we defy strict structure in our lives and we are reluctant to enter long term relationships (whether in love or business) because we know the &#8220;rules&#8221; of relationships are not always comfortable.</p>
<p>I like rules. I like structure. I like order. I think that is why I was drawn to the Rabbinate and why I am drawn to Law. I actually like Law School. I enjoy the pursuit of appreciating and understand the complex system that we live in. In the film, the umpire is portrayed almost like a villain. But to me, he is the arbiter of a legal issue and I find comfort in knowing that there are rules. To me, he is the good guy, he is enforcing the rules that make the game meaningful. With no rules in games, there is no meaning. This resonated with me.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> &#8211; And this is the real reason I was so moved by the film. The world I want to live in exists in this story. A world of Unity. The world I dream of where differences (like opposing teams in an important game), are not as important as similarities (humans, softball players, women, athletes, americans, etc etc etc). To them, the overall goals of living and loving each other trumped the differences they had as opponents. This film shows a world that I want to believe can exist.</p>
<p>A large number of my recent posts have touched on this very issue. I have been writing about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/?s=unity" target="_blank">Unity</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/?s=tolerance" target="_blank">Tolerance</a> for a little while now. Working as the Rabbi of the Pacific Jewish Center, especially at the Shul on the Beach has only reinforced this strong yearning within me. I meet so many different people. I am convinced that the more we understand about one another, the more we can develop mutual respect and appreciation for one another. Certainly, looking to our similarities primarily and our differences secondarily is a good step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago I <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/26/cant-we-all-just-get-along/" target="_blank">wrote about the photo of NBA players from Israel and Iran looking like the best of friends</a>. I also <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/18/go-to-the-ant-sluggard-see-her-ways-and-become-wise-proverbs-66/" target="_blank">wrote about learning from ants that we should help each other when we are in need</a>. A while ago I <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/09/21/teamwork-important-in-sports-more-important-in-life/" target="_blank">wrote about using concepts of teamwork in our daily lives</a>. I have spoke from the pulpit about Unity on Rosh Hashana, Yom Kippur and more recently, Chanukah.</p>
<p>This film just brought all the passion I have for unity and tolerance into such clear terms. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><span style="color: #888888;"><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/my-chanukah-message-to-you-light-knows-no-friend-or-foe/heart_candles-7047/" rel="attachment wp-att-1842"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1842" title="heart candles" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/heart_candles-7047-300x240.jpg" alt="heart candles" width="242" height="193" /></a>This was the main message of my sermon for the first Shabbos Chanukah. I hope to publish the sermon in its entirety in the coming days.</em></span></p>
<p>I would like to share with you an important message that strikes me as central to Chanukah and in particular to Chanukah in 2009.</p>
<p>In Friday&#8217;s NY Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/opinion/11brooks.html?em" target="_blank">David Brooks writes</a> about the Chanukah story. The article is interesting, a bit provocative and very thoughtful. I recommend reading the article in its entirety.</p>
<p>In his words:<span id="more-1840"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Mattathiasâs five sons, led by Judah Maccabee, then led an insurgent revolt against the regime. The Jewish civil war raised questions: Who is a Jew? Who gets to define the right level of observance? It also created a spiritual crisis. This was not a battle between tribes. It was a battle between theologiesâ¦ The lesson of Hanukkah is that even the struggles that saved a people are dappled with tragic irony, complexity and unattractive choices. And he is right and the struggle </em><em>continues today.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Maccabees fought their own Jewish brothers and sisters in an effort to regain control over a Jewish people that were spiraling into assimilation. As Brooks says, in their victory there remains a tragic irony.</p>
<p>Chanukah is a festival that reminds us of the fragmentation within Judaism. Whether it is the ancient epic struggle of Yosef and his brothers or the more current struggles between Jews from along theÂ spectrum of politics, different hometowns in Europe, different Rabbis, different neighborhoods and even between more observant and less observant Jews, unity eludes us.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why the element of <em>pirsumei nisa</em>, of publicizing the grand events of Chanukah is so central to its mitzva. In no other mitzva is there so strong an element of publicizing that the observance of the mitzva depends upon it. How are we to publicize? Is it with bullhorns or billboards? TV ads or Â 2 page spreads in the NY Times?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It is by lighting candles. It is with fire. It is with light. The light unites us. The light does not play favorites. The light knows no sides. Fire is fire. The way we celebrate the festival of Chanukah is by publicizing a message of light. A universal light. A light that knows no friend or foe. Where there is light, there is light for all. We proclaim the Chanukah story with light. We proclaim a dedication to unity.</p>
<p>This Chanukah let us reunite.</p>
<p><em>We can do it </em>and we have the resources to do it. It is time to set aside differences and unite under the themes and ideals that we agree upon and not look to our differences for fuel towards animosity. Let us look for unity in one another.</p>
<p>If we can do that,Â it will be a modern day Chanukah miracle.</p>
<p><em>Part of my recent inspiration: (Matisyahu &#8211; One Day). Play the song and listen very carefully to the words.</em></p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/11520225?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Yes, this is the song <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/04/matisyahu-nbc-and-the-olympic-winter-games-make-a-great-team/" target="_blank">I mentioned as the soundtrack on the NBC promo for the Vancouver Olympics</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><div id="attachment_1744" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1744 " title="peace love" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/2256238213_6d7188379c-300x199.jpg" alt="Photo: Flickr/cortniedee." width="210" height="139" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Flickr/cortniedee.</p></div>
<p>A few days ago a photo was posted on <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">Twitter</a> by the <a href="http://twitter.com/NBA" target="_blank">NBA</a>. Somehow, this photo has been on my mind since I saw it.</p>
<p>In sports, two teams oppose each other under the pretense that they are enemies. Their fans may even dislike one another, (see Celtics / Lakers, Yankees / Red Sox, UNC / Duke, etc,) but in the end, athletes are mostly friendly with each other. Even when athletes get upset or physical with one another, they can remain friends (see Kobe Bryant and Ron Artest).</p>
<p>In the real world, people have a harder time getting along. People divide along political lines, religious lines and country lines.<span id="more-1740"></span></p>
<p>The natural state of people is almost to be at odds with one another. Peace is not just the lack of war.Â Peace is the active interrelation of two entities in harmonious activity. The opposite of peace is not war, it is merely lack of working together. It is pretty easy for two entities to ignore each other, but that is not peace. Peace is working together. Yet, peace remains so elusive on a grand scale and an individual scale.</p>
<p>This is something that is really hard for me. I honestly (perhaps naively) believe that almost all friction and disagreement is a result of misunderstanding and miscommunication. At our core, we know how to get along but the reality of society and our environment confuses us into discord. Maybe I am wrong, but this what I believe.</p>
<p>That is why seeing this photo was so stirring. It was a photo that showed that when the context changes, when our environment is different, peace is so easy. Sports provides the context for enemies to befriend one another.</p>
<p>Are there two greater enemies in the world today than Israel and Iran?</p>
<p>And yet, below you will see a photo of the best Israeli basketball player, who is now playing for the Sacramento Kings, Omri Casspi and the best Iranian basketball player, playing for the Memphis Grizzlies, Hamed Haddadi. They look like the best of friends. Yet, in their home countries people are dying for their causes in defiance of the opposing cause&#8230;</p>
<p>It is my fervent wish and prayer that we can find peace. Not just peace between nations with differences, but personal peace within ourselves and within our relationships and communities.</p>
<p>Just think of this photo the next time you are about to pass judgment or prolong a disagreement. We can all get along, we can all be a part of peace, we can all unite under the banner of the human race and be tolerant of whoever we encounter.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/CASSPI-HADDADI.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5495" title="CASSPI-HADDADI" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/CASSPI-HADDADI.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="823" /></a></p>
<p>Tolerance. Love. Peace.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
