<p><em>Write an article about modesty that is respectful to men and women, makes a case for an orthodox Jewish version of tznius, and it also has to make tznius sound pleasant.</em></p>
<p>Can I do it? This is my attempt.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of <i>tznius</i> in orthodox Judaism. The first is the concept of modesty. The second is the details of how <i>tznius</i> is observed in orthodox Judaism. I admit that it is much easier to make a case for the first aspect than it is for the second. But I submit that once one is convinced of the first aspect, the second aspect becomes much easier. But I am hopeful that we can carve out a third aspect to <i>tznius</i>, if not in practice yet, at least in theory.</p>
<p>The Sefer HaChinuch asks an excellent question. There is a mitzvah to kindle the fire of the altar in the Temple. A priest would light the fire every day. If the Temple needs a fire, someone has to to light it. The problem is that we have a tradition that the fire on the altar came from heaven and thus there was no need for a mere mortal to light the fire.</p>
<p><span id="more-7298"></span></p>
<p>Answers the Sefer HaChinuch, this is the way of God. Whenever God acts in a miraculous way that displays God&#8217;s greatness, God will seek to hide God&#8217;s greatness and make the miracle appear to be natural. There will always be a way to rationalize the miracle as a non-miracle. This explains the requirement that a priest light the fire on the altar. It must appear that God is not acting in a way that is clearly miraculous.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s reasonable to say that God&#8217;s &#8220;moment&#8221; in the Bible was the splitting of the Sea of Reeds. That was the bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, down by three runs, and God hits it out of the park for the win. It&#8217;s the defining moment in our relationship with God until this very day and one of the most dramatic episodes in the Bible. It&#8217;s very interesting to note what is recorded in the Torah before the sea actually split. We are told that Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and strong winds stirred up the sea water all night. The next day God split the sea.</p>
<p>The Chinuch explains that God&#8217;s miracles must be hidden. God could have been a show-off and designed this big moment to be as dramatic as possible. The waters could have been completely still, Moses could have been crying on his hands and knees begging for mercy, and then God would swoop in at the last possible moment and save the Israelites with a grand show. But instead God hid the miracle behind outstretched arms and swirling winds.</p>
<p>This is the way of our God. Our God is modest. Even our all powerful God chooses to limit God&#8217;s exposure when performing miracles. The Chinuch concludes that this is true greatness. One who is great is not one who needs to make a show of oneself. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Jewish modesty. <i>V&#8217;halachta b&#8217;drachav</i>. We emulate God&#8217;s character. <i>V&#8217;hatzneah leches im Elokecha</i>. Walk modestly with your God.</p>
<p>Every person should strive to be Godly. Greatness is found when people don&#8217;t expose everything. This is the paradigm that we learn from God. Overexposure is unGodly.</p>
<p>But what is the reason for this? Is it some rule that can&#8217;t be explained? Or can we make some sense of this?</p>
<p>I think it does have some basis in reality. We are easily distracted. Please note, I am not saying we are perverts or we have a hard time controlling ourselves. I am saying that our minds are biased towards simplicity and gravitate toward the external things that are easily seen. Marketers know this and they distract us with beautiful people in their ads for horse manure. But wisdom and maturity are seeing things that are beneath the surface. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>Of course it is entirely possible for a beautiful naked person to be espousing wisdom. It’s just harder to hear the wisdom. This had nothing to do with Judaism or God. Professors at universities, CEOs, and politicians in our Western society dress at least somewhat formally. We all understand this.</p>
<p>Taken to another level, we all disregard showboaters and over-aggressive, transparent, self-promotors. We dismiss those kinds of people and their ideas are taken far less seriously. Our minds know that greatness is usually not “in your face.” We know that greatness is hidden. I think this is the rational explanation for God&#8217;s behavior in hiding God&#8217;s miracles.</p>
<p>Modesty in Judaism is supposed to reflect this value. It applies equally to men and women and applies equally to clothing as it does to the rest of one&#8217;s life. This is the Jewish concept of modesty. It is the first aspect. It explains the value in limiting one&#8217;s external exposure.</p>
<p>If it ended here, we would all take this lesson to heart and try to make our own decisions in consonance with this ideal. Practices would vary but we would all try to live with this concept in our lives.</p>
<p>But orthodox Judaism is not just about ideas and concepts. The rabbis of the Talmud and their halachic heirs take these concepts and interpret them into laws. These are really old laws. Some are 2000 years old. Other more “recent” laws are only several hundred years old.</p>
<p>Over the millennia, the laws of each time and place were added to our legal codes. The rigid laws of our current <i>tznius</i> standards of clothing, whether from the stringent or lenient extremes are borne out of this system. They don&#8217;t really make sense today. They are not really expected to make sense today. These laws are mostly anachronistic.</p>
<p>Today’s laws seem to draw arbitrary lines about what can be seen and what may not be seen. There is little rhyme or reason and this is a breeding ground for stringencies and false displays of piety. With no firm halachic foundation, it is easy to invent new and improved ideas about <i>tznius </i>that can creep into society and become de facto standards seemingly overnight. Some people draw the line here and others draw the line over there. If you’re in doubt? Cover it up. Better to be safe than sorry. The spirit of <i>tznius </i>can be hard to find under these circumstances.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line it seems, we have collectively lost the ability to adapt our laws for modernity within the confines of halacha. That being said, orthodox Jews conform to halachic standards. Sometimes it&#8217;s not easy, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t really make perfect sense, but it&#8217;s the laws that we have and until they are abrogated they are the laws we must keep. This is the second aspect.</p>
<p>There is no real theological reason that <i>tznius</i> should be so heavily regulated and codified in Jewish law while all the other areas of our lives that require us to act with modesty are left to our whims and desires. Rather it is social. Dress codes and sensuality are things that people have traditionally been concerned with and thus we have a huge compilation of laws associated with <i>tznius</i>. This despite the fact that <i>tznius</i> in the Talmud is barely a blip on a very large radar. when it is mentioned it is mentioned as a restriction against reciting the Shema or matrimonial disputes. It is hardly recognizable as a formulaic dress code.</p>
<p>It can feel like there is a huge disconnect between the first aspect and the second aspect. To me it feels that way sometimes. But sometimes there is a price to pay if one wants to be part of orthodox Judaism. This is the way orthodox Judaism is now. It’s not perfect, but it’s the way the first aspect is attempted to be lived contemporarily.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think it always will have to be this way. Mormons also have very strict modesty laws. Their laws also relate to all areas of one&#8217;s life but there is a dress code as well. Their dress code is updated from time to time. It&#8217;s a modern version of modesty. There are some hard and fast rules, but it is not 17th century modesty. It is modern modesty. One who follows their guidelines would certainly be emulating God&#8217;s modesty of hiding greatness behind a veil.</p>
<p>However, if an orthodox Jew would dress in the Mormon way they would probably be shunned by their orthodox Jewish friends and neighbors. It&#8217;s almost certain that they would be chastised by rabbis and modesty activists. But I would venture to guess that they would be modest and they would be satisfying the Godly standard of the Chinuch.</p>
<p>There are two Judaisms. There is the Judaism between Jew and God and there is the Judaism between Jew and fellow Jew. They are not always the same thing.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is a good example of this. One can be dressed very respectfully, modestly, and Godly but still not follow the laws of <i>tznius</i> as they are practiced in orthodox Judaism today. Conversely, one can follow the letter of the law of <i>tznius</i> and be the complete opposite of Godly. We all know this is true.</p>
<p>Maybe, if there is enough demand and enough people who won&#8217;t look down their noses at people with subjective standards of modesty, the first and second aspects of <i>tznius</i> could be reunited. I don&#8217;t expect it to happen quickly, I don&#8217;t even expect it to happen at all. But it is something to think about.</p>
<p>Perhaps there will be some sort of reformation within orthodox Judaism and the standards of <i>tznius</i> will be updated to modern sensibilities. I think guidelines that are similar to the Mormon regulations would be far less criticized than the standards we have today. This, coupled with a severe toning down of <i>tznius</i> rhetoric, blame, and false promises of salvation would completely change the tenor of the <i>tznius</i> conversation. We should be talking about God&#8217;s <i>tznius</i>. The kind of greatness the Chinuch describes is what our goal should be.</p>
<p>At the very least, I think attempting to emulate God in this manner is valuable. It can improve our lives. We can begin to appreciate the wisdom of universal modesty that applies to men and women in all of our lives. Understanding the circumstances that led to <i>tznius</i> regulations in orthodox Judaism today can also soften the challenge of arcane dress codes at least a little bit. But I think the hopeful part of this article is the most important part. Our collective standards might be able to change if we allow them to change. In our hearts we must know that in theory our goal is to be Godly in a way that is not intended nor should it ever be interpreted as a way to control women, burden women with the brunt of dealing with man&#8217;s animalism, some new-agey feminist form of liberation, or the fundamental way women serve God.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is meant to be a way of emulating God. Let’s bring that back and try to end the current trend of fetishizing <i>tznius.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/israel-jerus-285.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7269" alt="israel-jerus-285" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/israel-jerus-285-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>In many ways Mormons are like American Orthodox Jews. We share many values and our lifestyles are very similar. One thing that we share is the emphasis on modesty. The rules of modesty in Mormonism are far less rigid than they are in orthodox Judaism, but they are taken just as seriously. Their rules sound like 20th century rules and ours sound like 16th century rules. All this makes perfect sense considering when our books of law were codified.</p>
<p>One thing Mormons do at the tender age of 19 is they go on Missions. We have <a href="http://chinuch.org/project_seed.php" target="_blank">Project SEED</a> programs. It&#8217;s basically the same idea.</p>
<p>For many young Mormons it is their first real contact with non-Mormons on a regular basis. Obviously this creates new challenges for the missionaries. It seems that dealing with the relative immodesty of non-Mormons when compared with what they are accustomed to is a particularly difficult challenge.</p>
<p>Mormons are expected to be chaste in every possible way and this can be particularly difficult for young men.</p>
<p>A young man on a Mission where clothing is worn sparingly writes of his personal struggles.<span id="more-7268"></span> It is fascinating to hear him talk in Mormon terms about struggles that he shares with young Yeshiva students. What is most interesting is where he takes the article. I recommend reading the article for its content but also to compare it with our values and terminology.</p>
<p>He wants things to change. In short, he uses anecdotal evidence, scientific studies, and logic to argue that the overemphasis on modesty has the opposite of its intended effect. Instead of making it easier for men it makes it harder for men. Further, it does not ensure that women are thought of in the purest of terms. Finally, it reinforces unfortunate stereotypes about pleasure and intimacy that can have negative consequences later on in life and throughout marriage.</p>
<p>He concludes that it is time to rethink old ideas about sexuality in the Mormon Church.</p>
<p>I sense that a similar conversation is brewing in the orthodox Jewish community. All the talk of Tznius is having an opposite of its desired effect on so many people in our community. It has gone from reasonable to extreme to laughable. Has it even helped anything? What are the tangible benefits of increased modesty to an absurd degree?</p>
<p>Science and soft science have a lot to say about how we are affected by what we see and what we wear. Are we interested in what they say? Is there a way to bridge the gap between the two?</p>
<p>Will a budding Torah scholar with Yeshiva bona fides write an article like this? Are we ready for this conversation?</p>
<p>These are tough questions but I think we will be doing a world of good by trying to answer them.</p>

The author grew up in an environment where she was required to dress very modestly. She wore clothes the would not attract attention and was conscious of her appearance at all times. Unfortunately, her story took a sad turn when she developed an eating disorder in college. The point of the article is that modesty gave her the eating disorder.</p>
<p>It almost sounds like she could have grown up in one of many orthodox Jewish communities.</p>
<p>However the author is not Jewish. She was raised in a religious community that practices <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branhamism" target="_blank">Branhamism</a> and is known as &#8220;The Message of the Hour&#8221;. I believe this a key to establishing the difference between what her experience was with modesty and our modesty ideals.</p>
<p>The author writes that she was taught that modesty is an element of submitting to man&#8217;s world. She must be vigilant not to arouse a man under any circumstance. She was led to believe that she was always on display and that any slight furtive movement could be one that ruins her. She was even told as much by members of her community on more than one occasion. In her view, modesty meant she was always on display to be judged by men. She felt like she was to be hidden behind a curtain.</p>
<p>Some people have commented that this is the wrong way to approach modesty and she was taught about modesty incorrectly.<span id="more-5308"></span></p>
<p>So I did some research (by research, I mean I went to Wikipedia) and it seems that she was instilled with the messages of Branhamism as they are meant to be understood. See this paragraph on modesty:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Message believers hold to a literal interpretation of the Bible’s references to the role of women. Women are not allowed to preach or teach (1 Timothy 2:12) although they may testify, teach Sunday School, pray aloud, and operate the vocal gifts of the Spirit (1 Cor 12:10). Wives are taught to be in subjection to their husbands (1 Peter 3:1) and that they should have long hair (1 Corinthians 11:15). Divorce and remarriage is permitted for men &#8220;for the cause of fornication&#8221; (Matthew 5:31-32) but not for women.[34] (&#8220;Fornication&#8221; is defined as &#8220;undisclosed pre-marital sexual intercourse&#8221; by most groups, although some also include adultery as a just cause). Women are expected to dress &#8220;modestly&#8221; which means avoiding tight or revealing clothing as well as any garment that &#8220;pertaineth unto a man&#8221; (Deuteronomy 22:5), such as pants, shorts, slacks, overalls, etc.[35] Branham&#8217;s followers believe that using makeup is wrong because the only woman in the Bible who painted her face was Jezebel (2 Kings 9:30).</em></p>
<p>So, was it so farfetched that the author of the article understood the meaning of modesty as she did? I don&#8217;t think so. Using Biblical narratives as the model of modesty is bound to make modern women feel like the ancients. That is the point.</p>
<p>I think it is important for our community to recognize that there are unhealthy ways of preaching modesty. They could lead to disastrous results. It could lead to eating disorders, poor self-image, marital issues, obsessive compulsive disorder, and many other social or emotional problems. The lesson of the article is not to scrap modesty. It is to learn how not to impart it to our students and children.</p>
<p>I think the healthiest way to teach modesty is for it to be balanced and part of a broader approach to religious life. It cannot be the most important thing. It cannot be the thing by which we judge and are judged. It must be a personal desire to be comfortable and confident in who we are that we don&#8217;t feel the social pressure to dress provocatively. It would be even better if we could find a way out of the rigid social norms that now plague orthodox Jewish modesty. Where fitting in is equated with modesty and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/03/14/excellent-article-in-tablet-about-modesty-and-contemporary-orthodox-judaism/" target="_blank">Tznius Inflation</a> raises the stakes every few months. In a different time, a posek might have even been willing to allow modest pants to be worn seeing as they are not &#8220;for men&#8221; nor are they immodest. But we live in an orphaned generation bereft of halachic innovation. And even if a posek was willing to take a step out of the box, the public would likely reject it. This is just an unfortunate reality of our time.</p>
<p>At the very least, we should be sure to educate our community about the harms of eating disorders and other social problems associated with self-image. Although it may unintentional, placing such emphasis on the way we look and the way we dress, even for religious reasons, can create problems far worse than showing too much skin.</p>

<p>I read this excellent article on Tablet today. It&#8217;s a great article for a lot of reasons. For me, the best part of the article is that I agree with almost every word! (Half kidding.) For the purposes of this post I will assume you have also read the article. Click here: <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/93971/tights-squeeze" target="_blank">Tablet Magazine</a>, read the article and come back when you are done.</p>
<p>The writer, a young woman studying at Stern College, comes from a more insular background than the Yeshiva University environment she now associates with. Her accounts of life in the more insular community are accurate and I myself have experienced many of the same sentiments first hand. I have heard of almost all the rest of them second hand.<span id="more-5271"></span></p>
<p>The single most important indicator of religious piety has become modesty. If that sounds ironic, it is because it is. Real modesty is to shift the focus from the external to the internal. The obsession with modesty has turned it into the very opposite of modesty.</p>
<p>I recently heard that a woman was &#8220;off the derech&#8221;. The proof was that she was seen in pants and only covering most of her hair with a hat. Why is that the deciding factor? And why are we talking about it?</p>
<p>Tznius has also turned into an arms race. The more stringent we can be with our children and communities, the more safe we feel in our observance. I don&#8217;t need to tell tales or name names, but my observation has been that the standards have increased to less reasonable levels in my own lifetime. Women being blurred out of photos, advertisements telling women to hide on Purim, summer camps for young children with only girls present are expected to have strict dress codes are all recent examples that I have seen of tznius inflation.</p>
<p>The article expresses an almost hesitant appreciation for secular wisdom and art. That is unfortunate but understandable. In the yeshiva world, beauty is found in Judaism and Torah. Searching for beauty and wisdom elsewhere is discouraged and frowned upon. I don&#8217;t think this is the way of truth. Our great Torah giants from almost all previous generations venerated all wisdom. We should as well.</p>
<p>I hope the article goes viral. I hope everyone reads the article. The insular community should see how it is perceived by those who leave it but remain true to orthodox Judaism. In fact, I wish the YU style community and yeshivish community could somehow bridge the gap and find more common ground. I see YU shifting to the right, but almost as if to one-up them, the more insular community has taken its own turn to the right. If the communal standards were less rigid, I think we would find that there is beauty in both ways of life. But it can be hard to see the beauty when it feels to many as if beauty must be repressed and hidden.</p>
<p>Great article Avital. I hope to read more of your writing in the future!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tznius-modesty.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5061" title="tznius-modesty" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tznius-modesty-300x222.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="222" /></a>So much excellent writing has come forth due to the controversy over Beit Shemesh and Meah Shearim. This week two additions to the genre found themselves at the top of the heap.</p>
<p>Both authors are rabbis. Neither are rabbis that are appreciated or recognized by anyone (or almost no-one) in the right wing orthodox Jewish community. That&#8217;s a shame because their message is valuable for the RWOJ community and they will not read or pay heed to these articles because they come from outside.</p>
<p>There is room to quibble over details within these articles but I think we can all agree that the sentiments are important and at the very least deserve a response if not agreement.</p>
<p>The first article was written by Rabbi Marc Angel. In his article, Rabbi Angel proposes modern tznius guidelines that do not change halacha but do change social expectations. In his words:<span id="more-5060"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The goal should be to create frameworks for normal interactions between men and women, where men and women conduct themselves properly without reducing each other to mere objects of sexual attraction.</em></p>
<p>Two things. First of all, I don&#8217;t think this is a fair characterization. I don&#8217;t think the complete social separation of men and women automatically reduces people to sex object. I do think this is one possible result of many.</p>
<p>Second of all, this is never going to happen. Unfortunately.</p>
<p>I once made a relevant comment to a friend of mine as we observed a kiddush celebrating the birth of a child / grandchild in a home where there were separate entrances for men and women and once inside, the men were in one room and the women were in a completely separate room. We were discussing the difference between this kind of celebration and one outside the RWOJ community. Absolute separation of married men and women is seen as necessary in the RWOJ. The rationale is usually something like &#8220;if men and women fraternize together, it will lead to sin&#8221;. But the truth is that men and women socialize together all the time and they don&#8217;t sin. Yet, this perception persists in the RWOJ community.</p>
<p>Rabbi Angel hits it on the head. RWOJ do not envision a framework for men and women to engage in normal interactions. If this changes then perhaps other things will change too. I just don&#8217;t see it happening.</p>
<p>The second article is much more prominent as it appeared in the NY Times. This article was written by Rabbi Dov Linzer, the Rosh Yeshiva of Chovevei Torah which makes his words less meaningful than a republican senator in the eyes of a RWOJ. But he also makes some good points that are worth exploring.</p>
<p>In making his main point, Rabbi Linzer raises the conundrum of sexual purity in the religious context: Who is responsible for licentious thoughts about immodest women?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8230;the Talmud, the basis for Jewish law, offers a perhaps surprising answer: It places the responsibility for controlling men’s licentious thoughts about women squarely on the men.</em></p>
<p>This is true and as Rabbi Linzer develops this point he places the focus on men who over-sexualize women as opposed to women who may not dress in accordance with tradition.</p>
<p>Although, I would add that halacha in general speaks to men. There is no section in the Talmud or Code of Jewish Law that tells women how they should dress and behave in the public sphere. It is only in from the perspective of the men that we are given clues to what is expected of women. So, it is hard to draw definitive conclusions from omissions in the sources on this matter.</p>
<p>But all in all, I do agree with Rabbi Linzer. However, it is unfortunate that this is in the NY Times. At least it has not made their list of Most E-Mailed Articles.</p>
<p>I realize that these article will read like Chinese to RWOJs who measure skirt length with a tznius ruler and examine the denier of stockings. But maybe, just maybe, if an opposite perspective presented eloquently and forcefully the attitudes will slowly change.</p>
<p>Please read and share these articles. At the very least they will engender (hehe) discussion about these issues in a meaningful way. If you go to RWOJ shul, see what happens if you print these articles and give them to some friends in shul. That might be interesting&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the home page for <a href="http://espn.go.com/" target="_blank">ESPN.com</a> I noticed a new article by <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/keyword/search?searchString=Paul_Lukas" target="_blank">Paul Lukas</a> of <a href="http://www.uniwatchblog.com/" target="_blank">Uni Watch</a> fame. Lukas writes about the nuances and idiosyncrasies of sports uniforms.He notices everything from commemorative patches to new piping along the sides of a jersey. Nothing gets past the ever watchful eye of Uni Watch.</p>
<p>The article that caught my eye was about a <a href="http://www.gcupci.org/" target="_blank">religious Pentecostal high school</a> basketball team. Turns out these guys don&#8217;t wear shorts. Ever. Including basketball games. Immediately I was reminded of my elementary school days.</p>
<p><span id="more-299"></span>I went to a <a href="http://www.ashar.org/" target="_blank">religious Jewish elementary school</a> (in a previous incarnation of the school, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/rabbi-aaron-fink/" target="_blank">my father</a> was the Dean). We had a basketball team and we did wear shorts but one teammate of ours was a little more spiritual than the rest of us and he did not wear shorts. There is an element of modesty involved in not wearing shorts and this fellow was very sensitive to maintaining that level of modesty. Eventually this guy has gone on to be a very big Torah scholar and is now teaching in a Yeshiva. (It&#8217;s not because he did not wear shorts, he was on that path regardless.)</p>
<p>Gate City Christian teaches the traditional Bible concept that it is more respectful to dress in a more respectful way and this includes on the basketball court. Morals shouldn&#8217;t disappear (or even hide) when we get on the field or court. The Talmud says that a person can be judged by three things. B&#8217;kisso (his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miser" target="_blank">money</a>), B&#8217;kaaso (his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger" target="_blank">temper</a>) and B&#8217;koso (his cup &#8211; meaning when he / if he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage" target="_blank">drinks</a>). I had a teacher who once added &#8211; B&#8217;Kaduro (with his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports" target="_blank">ball playing</a>). The message these kids are being taught is the same. The school teaches them to act modestly in their lives and the ball field or court is no different. I think that is a great lesson.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/090128" target="_blank">article</a> then proceeds to discuss other modifications of traditional basketball attire for religious purposes. A religious Jewish girls high school basketball team is featured because they only wear skirts. In fact the team name is the &#8220;Skirts&#8221;. They are actually pretty good according to the article. Observant Jewish women traditionally wear skirts below the knee and make sure that they are covered from the neck down to the knee. As the article mentions this is to help the person focus on their inner self and help others recognize them for who they are not how they are dressed.</p>
<p>The idea of modesty in Judaism is to help promote focusing on the true person by removing additional distractions from finding that true person. In a materialistic and hedonistic world we are easily distracted by superficial outer beauty so we promote the inner beauty by minimizing those distractions. More profoundly is the idea that the greater something is &#8211; the more concealed it is. We discussed this at length in a <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/05/beauty-is-it-more-than-skin-deep-connections-1509/" target="_blank">Connections </a>about beauty. I recommend checking that out!</p>
<p>What is great is that the article presented the concept in a very refreshing way. I think people that read the article will come away with an appreciation for the Torah concept of modesty (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/05/beauty-is-it-more-than-skin-deep-connections-1509/" target="_blank">listen to the class</a> for an understanding of what that is all about) and I think that is just great!</p>
