				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is an interesting interpretation by the Torah Temimah where he uses scientific knowledge to explain a dispute in the Talmud.</p>
<p>The verse in Parshas Breishis states <em>&#8220;There went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.&#8221;</em> The Torah Temimah quotes the Babylonian Talmud in Mesechta Taanis 9B that records a dispute between R&#8217; Eliezer and R&#8217; Yehoshua regarding the source of rain.<span id="more-7655"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[Copied from Soncino] &#8220;R. Eliezer said: The whole world draws its water supply from the waters of the ocean, as it is said, But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole of the ground. Thereupon R. Joshua said to him: But are not the waters of the ocean salty? He replied: They are sweetened by the clouds. R. Joshua said: The whole world drinks from the upper waters, as it is said, And drinketh water as the rain of heaven cometh down. If so, what is the force of the verse, ‘But there went up a mist from the earth’? This teaches that the clouds grow in strength as they rise towards the firmament and then open their mouth as a flask and catch the rain water, as it is said, Which distill rain from His vapor, they are perforated like a sieve and they slowly distill waters on the ground.&#8221;<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/evaporation.pdf"><br />
</a><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7657" alt="water_cycle" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/water_cycle-600x307.png" /></p>
<p>The Torah Temimah explains what R&#8217; Eliezer means using (then) modern science. R&#8217; Yehoshua is correct. The waters of the oceans are salty and unfit for drinking. Therefore R&#8217; Yeshoshua concludes that rain water cannot come from the oceans. R&#8217; Eliezer understood that the reason the waters of the ocean must rise to the clouds and then return to the earth is to desalinize the ocean water. Only the water evaporates while the impurities like salt are left behind.</p>
<p>This can be demonstrated by boiling dirty water says the Torah Temimah. The droplets that form on the lip of the boiling pot are pure water no matter what the water in the pot looks like. Similarly, the salt and minerals in water on earth are removed when the water evaporates and are returned to earth via the clouds in the sky. That&#8217;s why R&#8217; Eliezer says the whole world draws water from the oceans. R&#8217; Yehoshua is confused because the ocean waters are salty. To which R&#8217; Eliezer replies that the waters are sweetened during the evaporation and cloud process just like the droplets on the lid of the pot boiling dirty water.</p>
<p>I read this and thought this was a pretty good explanation of R&#8217; Eliezer&#8217;s position. Unfortunately it leaves R&#8217; Yehoshua in a very vulnerable position. What are we to think happened after R&#8217; Eliezer explained evaporation to R&#8217; Yehoshua? Perhaps when presented with the scientific explanation he acquiesced to R&#8217; Eliezer. The Talmud assumes he did not because the subsequent discussion deals with R&#8217; Yehoshua&#8217;s position as equally viable to R&#8217; Eliezer&#8217;s.</p>
<p>More importantly, could R&#8217; Eliezer have known this scientific information? According to my brief Internet research, it seems that the basic principles of natural desalination were known to the Greeks. It&#8217;s possible that R&#8217; Eliezer adopted something he heard from them. Although I am unsure if they understood that evaporated seawater turned into clouds in the manner the Torah Temimah understands it. Of course, it is possible that R&#8217; Eliezer received this scientific information from God or some Divine Tradition. Personally, I do not subscribe to this view, but many others do.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the correct explanation R&#8217; Eliezer&#8217;s position. It is elegant in its explanation and pretty clever but it leaves us with other unanswered questions. Either way, kudos to the Torah Temimah for using his secular knowledge in his commentary on the Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dore_Return_of_the_Spies_From_the_Land_of_Promise.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7158" alt="Dore_Return_of_the_Spies_From_the_Land_of_Promise" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dore_Return_of_the_Spies_From_the_Land_of_Promise-238x300.jpg" width="238" height="300" /></a>In Parshas Shlach, Moshe sends the spies to the Land of Israel. Just prior to their departure the Torah tells us that Moses called Hoshea bin Nun Yehoshua. The common reading of the verse is that Moses changed Hoshea&#8217;s name to Yehoshua. No reason is given in the text of the Chumash for this change.</p>
<p>The Talmud in Sota (34b) famously tells us that Moses &#8220;<em>said &#8211; Yud Hey [the name of God] will save you from the plot of the spies</em>.&#8221; I think most people understand this interpretation of Chazal as saying that Moses had a premonition about the mission from the start. He somehow knew that they were going to sin. To protect Hoshea from sin Moses added God&#8217;s name to Hoshea so that he would be saved from their scheme.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah asks the obvious questions here. First, if Moses knew about the plot how could he send them to sin? Second, the best he could muster was a name change for Hoshea? If he knew they were going to sin he should have offered protection for all of them!</p>
<p>Because of these questions the Torah Temimah reinterprets what Chazal are saying here.<span id="more-7156"></span> He says that he Moses actually thought that the plot was going to come from Hoshea. This is because Hoshea was from the family of Joseph. Joseph had a history of Lashon Hara from the incidents with his brothers back in Parshas Vayeshev. So Moses thought the best solution was to cut off the problem at its head. If Joseph&#8217;s progeny would not concoct the plan, the spies would be safe.</p>
<p>What of Gadi ben Susi? He was also from the family of Joseph?</p>
<p>Answers the Torah Temimah that it could be that Hoshea was more beloved to Moses because he was his student and also because he would be the one to bring the people to Israel and Moses was understandably more concerned with his fate. Whereas with Gadi Moses was less concerned because it was a far-fetched concern anyway.</p>
<p>Then the Torah Temimah tells us that the actual blessing given to Hoshea was not that &#8220;Yud Hey [the name of God] will save you from the plot of the spies.&#8221; Rather, Moses simply said &#8220;God should save you from bad ideas&#8221; and it was just Chazal who editorialized the blessing in light of what actually ended up happening.</p>
<p>In other words, Moses preferred to give the blessing to his close student because he was human after all and human nature is to care more about people who are close to us. Further, Moses did not know the spies were going to sin. He was nervous about his student because of his family history. But Moses did not predict the future here. He was more like a concerned Jewish father figure.</p>
<p>I think this is improves on the standard way we learned this statement of Chazal as children. It makes the characters more complex and more human. It runs counter to the current trend of deifying our Biblical and contemporary heroes. The Torah Temimah approach resonates more deeply with me and I have a hunch it is worth reintroducing into our Torah discourse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6733" alt="ancient-bow-arrow47212524193719900" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ancient-bow-arrow47212524193719900-300x199.jpeg" width="300" height="199" />In Parshas Vayechi Yaakov blesses his grandsons, Ephraim and Menasheh with a special blessing. Then Yaakov turns to Yoseph and informs him that he has given Yoseph a double portion by considering his two sons to be tribes equal to the immediate sons of Yaakov. The end of this declaration is an enigmatic phrase where Yaakov says &#8220;אֲשֶׁר לָקַחְתִּי מִיַּד הָאֱמֹרִי, בְּחַרְבִּי וּבְקַשְׁתִּי.&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;<em>&#8230;which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my <strong>sword</strong> and with my <strong>bow</strong>.&#8221;<br />
</em></p>
<p>The Talmud (Bava Basra 123A) asks: Did Yaakov conquer with his sword and his bow?! [...] Rather חרבי (the sword) refers to prayer and קשתי (my bow) refers to בקשה (request from God).</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah explains this statement by connecting the word חרבי to the well known verse in Psalms that is recited every day during morning prayers: <em>&#8220;The praises of God are in their throats and the dual edged sword is in their hands.&#8221;</em> The Talmud in Brachos says this alludes to prayer. The second part refers to request from God - בקשות &#8211; because it is related to prayer. The word קשתי (my bow) is not related to prayer or request, it&#8217;s just that since we say חרבי refers to prayer and קשתי sounds like בקשה we interpret it as &#8220;request&#8221; and when it says ובקשתי it means &#8220;with my בקשה&#8221;.</p>
<p><span id="more-6725"></span></p>
<p>According to this, says the Torah Temimah, the correct text in the Talmud should be unlike the way we have it in our version of the Talmud which says &#8220;קשתי זו בקשה&#8221; it should say &#8220;<strong>ב</strong>קשתי זו בקשה&#8221;. With this version of the Talmudic text the word being interpreted is בְקַשְׁתִּי which is easier to hear as בקשתי -&#8221;with my בקשה&#8221;. Saying &#8220;קשתי זו בקשה&#8221; is weak. The word קשתי has nothing to do with&#8221;requests&#8221;. However בְקַשְׁתִּי has the exact same letters as בקשתי [bakashati] &#8211; my request. Therefore it makes much more sense if the Talmud would say בקשתי זו בקשה. Unfortunately, our Talmud says קשתי זו בקשה. It seems the Torah Temimah would like to change the text of the Talmud to the proper בקשתי זו בקשה.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah then reports that he later found a manuscript that had it this way. He concludes with&#8221;Thank God, for he has led me along the path of Truth&#8221;.</p>
<p>I did a little legwork. The Vilna Shas says it the way it&#8217;s quoted in the Torah Temimah at first. That is &#8220;קשתי זו בקשה&#8221;. As the Torah Temimah noted, this is not an ideal version of the text. The Vatican Manuscript has the same text as our Talmud. That&#8217;s no help either. However, the French Bibliotheque Manuscript does say &#8220;בקשתי זו בקשה&#8221;! So we have a winner! I think the Torah Temimah is right. This should be the proper text in the Talmud.</p>
<p>It\&#8217;s amazing to see how a careful reading of the Talmud and asking the right questions can validate a discarded manuscript. Interestingly enough, there are two other examples of manuscripts vindicating a proposed textual change in the  Talmud according to the Torah Temimah just in Parshas Vayechi.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6694" alt="6081358_f520" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/6081358_f520-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" />This week we had two somewhat interesting Torah Temimahs. Neither are bombshells from the Torah Temimah, but they are still worth noting.</p>
<p><b>I. Science and Chazal</b></p>
<p><em>&#8220;These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.&#8221;</em> (Genesis 46:15)</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>R. Isaac citing R. Ammi stated: If the woman emits her semen first she bears a male child; if the man emits his semen first she bears a female child; for it is said, If a woman emits semen and bear a man-child.</em>&#8221; (Babylonian Talmud Nida 31A, translation Soncino)</p>
<p>The Talmud offers the verse from Vayigash as support for this statement. The idea is that the verse connects the sons to Leah and the daughter to Yaakov (thanks commenter Benny).</p>
<p>Now obviously, this is scientifically incorrect. There are several ways to deal with this kind of problem. Some will say Chazal were correct and science is incorrect. Others will say science is correct and Chazal are wrong. Others will say that the Talmud is speaking in metaphors, or mysticism, or some other non-literal interpretation.</p>
<p>It seems that the Torah Temimah is unaware that the science in this Talmudic statement was wrong, but he provides important insight nonetheless.<span id="more-6668"></span></p>
<p>If one were to try to say that Chazal were wrong about science in this instance, one might also need to say that the Torah was wrong. After all, Chazal are apparently gleaning this insight from the words in the Torah. While it is a matter of controversy to say Chazal were wrong about science, it is a matter of heresy to say the Torah is &#8220;wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Says the Torah Temimah (translation my own): <em>It seems obvious that substance of this idea was known to Chazal from the science [of their day] that everything goes according to the last force, and therefore if the man seeds first his force ends earlier and the embryo will follow the force of the end which is her seed and therefore the child will be female and vice versa. But only as a hint and sign did they rely on this verse. </em>Then the Torah Temimah proves from another Talmudic statement that this verse is not really a proof per se.</p>
<p>With this, the Torah Temimah has opened the door for one to say that Chazal were obviously basing their statement on contemporary science as opposed to some revealed wisdom and they were simply using the verse as a way of hinting toward their accepted wisdom. While this remains a matter of controversy in orthodox Jewish circles, it&#8217;s apparent that many great scholars held this way, including the Torah Temimah.</p>
<p><strong>II. An Important R&#8217;osh</strong></p>
<p>Chazal famously say that Yocheved was born between the walls of Egypt. They say this to explain a problem in the text. That is, the verse says that 70 people went with Yaakov to Egypt. The problem is that if you count the people mentioned in the Torah, it&#8217;s only 69 people and the Torah doesn&#8217;t mention her name because she was only a fetus. The Talmud even provides some textual support for this interpretation. The verse merely says that Yocheved was <em>born </em>in Egypt (Numbers 26:59), so we can infer that she was not conceived in Egypt.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah alerts us to a comment of the R&#8221;osh (Rabeinu Asher) at the end of Mesechta Pesachim §40. Some of the rishonim are bothered by the fact that the Torah says that we should count 50 days from Pesach to Shavuos and a different verse says to count seven complete weeks (49 days). The R&#8221;osh quotes some weak answers to this question and then drops the bomb. Says the R&#8221;osh: <i>There is no question here because the way of Scripture is when it gets to a round number minus one, Scripture uses the round number and it ignores the lower number. Similarly, we find the count of Yaakov&#8217;s family to be 70 (and another example).</i></p>
<p>This is huge. It is presumed by almost every serious orthodox Jew and most of the commentaries that every word in the Torah is absolutely precise and true. The R&#8221;osh obviously would agree. However, he has opened a door here. He is saying that the Torah is sometimes imprecise &#8211; specifically with regard to numbers. Would this also apply to a number like 600,000? Maybe. Maybe not. Is this an extension of <em>dibra Torah kilshon bnei adam? </em>Maybe.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah asks several good questions to poke holes in this R&#8221;osh. The gist of his attack is that Chazal and the Rishonim all took the numbers in the Torah to be precise so how could the R&#8221;osh disagree? So it&#8217;s unclear if the Torah Temimah likes this R&#8221;osh or not. But I like it either way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6643" alt="Biblical_Joseph" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Biblical_Joseph-269x300.jpg" width="269" height="300" />Parshas Miketz turns our attention to the story of Joseph&#8217;s meteoric rise to the Second in Command of Egypt. The Torah goes out of its way to tell us that Joseph and his wife had two sons before the years of famine began.</p>
<p>The Babylonian Talmud in Taanis (11a) picks up on this (Translation &#8211; Soncino). <em>&#8220;Resh Lakish said: A man may not have marital relations during years of famine, as it is said, And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The reasoning for this rule is apparently that it is wrong to add the burden of additional children at a time where resources are scarce. This is a lovely message. However Rashi in Taanis says the reason for this statement is that one should participate in the pain of the famine and since marital relations are pleasurable one should refrain from relations while others are suffering.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah quotes Tosafos in Taanis who asks how Yocheved could have been born while Jacob and his clan were moving from Israel to Egypt if it was a time of famine (assuming that she was conceived during the famine) as per the Midrash that states Yocheved was born at that time? Tosafos answer that this rule was only a stringency kept by super righteous people like Joseph.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah is not happy with this answer.<span id="more-6642"></span> First of all, Levi was Yocheved&#8217;s father. By all accounts he was a super righteous person. Moses has high praise for Levi in his blessings at the end of the Chumash. Further, the tribe of Levi did not sin at the Golden Calf because they were so super righteous!</p>
<p>Instead the Torah Temimah attempt to either interpret the words of Tosafos or offer his own answer to their question (it&#8217;s unclear to me). (I am paraphrasing the Torah Temimah here). He says that really it is permissible to engage in marital relations during a time of famine. There is no reason to add additional pain at a difficult time and relations are pleasurable. It&#8217;s not reasonable to ban pleasure when times are tough. It&#8217;s just that for someone like Joseph who was living in ivory towers in the lap of luxury it would have been inappropriate for him to engage in such pleasurable activities while his people were suffering through a famine. Joseph was joining in the pain of his people and as long as they were in famine he would not give himself the pleasure of marital relations.</p>
<p>With this explanation there is no question from Levi because Jacob and his family were certainly suffering due to the famine so they would have no such restrictions on them. This also explains the subsequent statement in the Talmud. That is: <em>Our Rabbis have taught: When Israel is in trouble and one of them separates himself from them, then the two ministering angels who accompany every man come and place their hands upon his head and say, ‘So-and-so who separated himself from the community shall not behold the consolation of the community’. </em>In other words, one who wants to associate with the suffering of the group sees the group comforted.</p>
<p>These two ideas are now related in a way that explains why they are stated back to back in the Talmud.</p>
<p>In closing the Torah Temimah has some reservations about this idea, although it fits perfectly, he says &#8220;it&#8217;s new&#8221; and it needs a lot of investigation and studying.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Shulchan Aruch (O.C 574) <i>paskens </i>that one should refrain from engaging in marital relations during a famine. So it seems that the Torah Temimah would disagree with that psak. Maybe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/furnace-fire.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6606" title="furnace-fire" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/furnace-fire-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>In Parshas Vayeshev we read the story of Tamar and Yehuda. Tamar is suspected of being harlot and following her conviction, she is sentenced to death by burning. Instead of exonerating herself by outing Yehuda, she accepts her fate and merely produces some evidence that shows Yehuda surreptitiously that he was the one who was with her.</p>
<p>The Talmud says that this teaches us that it is better to be burned alive in a fiery furnace than to embarrass one&#8217;s friend in public.</p>
<p>Tosafos ask the obvious question: If one must die in a fiery furnace rather than embarrass one&#8217;s friend, it should be included with the three cardinal sins of Judaism for which a Jew is required to give up one&#8217;s life? Those are murder, adultery, and idol worship. If embarrassing a friend must be avoided at the cost of death &#8211; it is equal to those three! Why is it omitted from the list?</p>
<p>Tosafos answer that only things that are explicit in the Torah are included in the list.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah infers that Tosafos mean that one is in fact required to give up one&#8217;s life to spare a friend embarrassment. Meaning that halachically there is no<em> </em>leeway. One must give up one&#8217;s life in order that one&#8217;s friend not be embarrassed.</p>
<p>This does not make the Torah Temimah happy.<span id="more-6604"></span> He says &#8220;if not for their words I think&#8230;&#8221; which is rabbinic code for &#8220;I very respectfully disagree&#8221;. Instead the Torah Temimah says (translation mine) that it is clear that one cannot include embarrassing a friend in the list of three cardinal sins. Rather he says that the Talmud was teaching <em>mussar</em> and good etiquette. One who does not heed the advice of the rabbis of the Talmud is not a called a <em>rasha,</em> rather he is just a person with bad character. Whereas with the three cardinal sins, the law actually requires one to martyr oneself rather than sin. One who violates one of those sins is a <em>rasha</em> and it is as if he violated the basic tenets of faith.</p>
<p>I think the significant thing here is not so much that the Torah Temimah has a different answer than Tosafos. The bomb here is that the Torah Temimah is willing to tame an extreme statement of Chazal and call it <em>mussar </em>instead of taking it literally. Tosafos did not do that. Many charedim today do not do that. But the Torah Temimah was willing to reinterpret an extreme statement of Chazal and say it was not halachic, rather it was a sermonic point that was designed to urge people to act properly without setting actual parameters of legal ramifications.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>

The verse says that Yaakov and his <em>eleven children</em> prepared for the encounter. Rashi quotes the famous Midrash that asks &#8220;where was Dina?&#8221; Seeing as Yaakov officially had twelve children at this point, the text requires explanation.</p>
<p>The answer given by the Midrash is that Yaakov hid Dina away from sight. He did not want Eisav to see Dina because he did not want Eisav to take Dina as a wife. The Midrash continues and says that Yaakov was punished for doing this. He should have given Eisav the opportunity to join his family by marrying Dina. Instead she ended up falling to Shechem.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah is really bothered by this. He asks: Where do we find anything like this? One should be obligated to marry off a daughter to an evil person just so that an evil person might repent? Plus, who knows? Maybe the evil person will influence the righteous daughter to break bad?<span id="more-6559"></span></p>
<p>The Torah Temimah answers  (translation my own, parentheticals are my additions):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> <em>It&#8217;s possible to say that Yaakov had no doubt whether Eisav would have repented, it was specifically because of this that Yaakov did not want to marry Dina to Eisav in order that Eisav </em>should not <em>repent. That is to say that Yaakov&#8217;s hate for Eisav (was so great) that he did not want Eisav to repent.</em></p>
<p>I think this is a little bit mind-blowing.</p>
<p>Some interpreters try to idolize and idealize our Bible Heroes. For example, the Daf recently learned the famous Talmudic reinterpretation of Reuven&#8217;s sin in this week&#8217;s parsha as a minor infraction and not adultery. This is a very common form of rabbinic interpretation. It&#8217;s almost jarring to see an interpretation that so humanizes a Patriarch. I also thought it was interested to see Yaakov hating Eisav instead of the usual Eisav hating Yaakov. For some reason, it resonated with me. How about you?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JudahEmblem.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6521" title="JudahEmblem" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JudahEmblem.png" alt="" width="150" height="214" /></a>In what has become a familiar refrain, the Torah Temimah in Parshas Vayetze takes the most expansive position available with regard to women prophetesses.</p>
<p>In Vayetze, Leah and Yaakov have a bunch of children who eventually become half of the tribes of Israel. In naming her fourth son, Leah decides to thank God &#8220;this time&#8221;. The commentaries wonder why Leah is thanking God &#8220;this time&#8221;. Rashi explains that she was giving thanks for taking &#8220;more than her portion&#8221;. The idea is that there were four women who were the mothers of the tribes to be and there were to be 12 tribes. If each mother got her equal share they would each bear three sons. Leah was now on her fourth so she realized she was getting &#8220;more than she thought she was getting&#8221;. For this she thanked God.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah tells us that Rashi is quoting a Midrash Raba and that Leah knew this information because she saw it with <em>ruach hakodesh. </em>He then quotes a Maharsha that says that this cannot be a prophecy because Leah is not included in the list of twelve prophetesses in the first chapter of (Babylonian Talmud) Megillah 14A. Rather she made this proclamation with no intent and God placed it in her lips to speak of the future. The Torah Temimah remarks that this is very hard pill to swallow.<span id="more-6520"></span></p>
<p>So instead, the Torah Temimah says, and there is no need to quote him here so I will paraphrase, that all the matriarchs were prophetesses. He uses a Midrash Socher Tov to support this assertion as that Midrash makes a drasha to make the same point. He goes on to say that there are competing opinions among the rabbinic commentators and there are sources on each side of the debate. Therefore, one cannot ask from one source to the other.</p>
<p>Nothing too groundbreaking here, but the overall point is that once again the Torah Temimah is trying his best to include women as potential prophetesses. And for that we thank him.</p>
<p>Also, I think it is clear from the Maharsha and the Torah Temimah that <em>ruach hakodesh </em>would be considered prophecy. I am pretty sure this is the opinion of Maimonides. What&#8217;s interesting, is that it seems that one cannot posses <em>ruach hakodesh </em> unless one is a candidate for prophecy. Are there any opinions who claim authentic prophecy is possible today? Can we authoritatively rule out<em> ruach hakodesh</em> as well? At least according to this Maharsha? I think so.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ushpizin61.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6493" title="7prohetesses" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ushpizin61-283x300.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="300" /></a>You&#8217;ll recall that last week I wrote about the Torah Temimah&#8217;s opinion of R&#8217; Meir as it relates to women. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/11/12/an-interesting-torah-temimah-on-nashim-datan-kalot/">An Interesting Torah Temimah on Nashim Datan Kalot</a>) This week I discovered another interesting comment from the Torah Temimah that I think is also significant but not as significant.</p>
<p>Parshas Toldos begins with a confused Rivkah wondering why she was experiencing a very strange pregnancy. The passuk says וַתֵּלֶךְ, לִדְרֹשׁ אֶת-יְהוָה. Rivkah went to inquire with God. The verse does not say how exactly she made this inquiry.</p>
<p>The commentaries offer two main options. 1) She inquired with a prophet. 2) She prayed to God (Ramban).</p>
<p>The Torah continues and tells us: ,&#8230;וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה לָהּ &#8211; God said to her&#8230; Here the commentaries say that she was answered via prophecy. It could be that the Ramban would say that she was answered directly, but he does not comment on these words.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah mentions some speculation that the reason that God did not speak to her directly was because as a general rule God does not speak to women (save for Sarah) as per the Jerusalem Talmud in Sota (7:1) (apologies to Michelle Bachmann). However, the Torah Temimah directs us to his commentary in Parshas Vayera where the Torah tells us that God spoke directly to Sarah. Here he quotes the Jerusalem Talmud and then expands on it in his commentary.<span id="more-6490"></span></p>
<p>Here is what he says  (translation my own, parentheticals are my additions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This exegesis requires explanation in general, because we have seen several women who were prophetesses, as the (Babylonian) Talmud counts on 14A, Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Chana, Avigayil, Chuldah, Esther, and is so how is it that the Jerusalem Talmud says that we do not find God talking with women, since these women were prophetesses he must have spoke to them!?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And me must say that God&#8217;s talking with the prophetesses must have been with regard to public matters, whereas with regard to private matters God only spoke directly with Sarah. And that which it says when God spoke to Eve and Rebecca it must have been with a go-between as we explained there.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Also we can answer this question according to that which is written in the Guide (for the Perplexed by Maimonides) chapter 45, where he counts 11 levels of prophecy, and the level of prophecy for women is until the seventh level, look there, and according to this it can be said that the intent here (Jerusalem Talmud) is that Sarah reached the level of prophecy that is the pinnacle of prophecy, and that is the level of prophecy of (King) Solomon, and this is not the place to expound further.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a huge thing, but I see this as the Torah Temimah trying to &#8220;soften the blow&#8221;. The Jerusalem Talmud takes a very harsh stance towards women and their spiritual capabilities and the Torah Temimah doesn&#8217;t think that this is a great message. In classic rabbinic form he reinterprets the statement from the Jerusalem Talmud to make it much more palatable. It&#8217;s not women&#8217;s liberation propaganda. It&#8217;s not going to be in JOFA&#8217;s literature. But it is something. It might be an acknowledgement from a great Torah scholar that taken at face value, this is an offensive statement towards women.</p>
<p>I think that most women would feel more comfortable serving God that does talk to women than a God who does not talk to women. It could be that the Torah Temimah was trying to ensure that women not be led to believe that the simple reading of the Jerusalem Talmud is the only authority on the matter.</p>
<p>Then again, it might just be a commentator trying to reconcile contradictory statements. But I think that every exegete chooses their battles. The fact that the Torah Temimah chose this battle shows me something.</p>

<p><em>(I&#8217;ve been told that the proper pronunciation of Datan is with two syllables, not three. HT: Steg)</em></p>
<p>Perusing the Torah Temimah this Shabbos I noticed something that is noteworthy for one reason, and possibly very noteworthy for another. I admit that the second part of this post is speculation, but I welcome your thoughts on my thoughts.</p>
<p>The Passuk in Chayei Sarah declares that &#8220;God blessed Avraham Ba&#8217;kol.&#8221; Literally this means that God blessed Avraham with everything. The Talmud in Bava Basra (16B) relates a five-way dispute amongst the rabbis as to specifically what &#8220;Ba&#8217;Kol&#8221; means. We only need to look at the first three.</p>
<p><em>R&#8217; Meir says that Avraham was blessed by not having a daughter. R&#8217; Yehuda says that he was blessed with a daughter. The Acheirim say that he was blessed with a daughter named &#8220;Bakol&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>The Torah Temimah explains (translation my own, parentheticals are my additions):<span id="more-6452"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The opinion of R&#8217; Meir is consistent with other information we have about R&#8217; Meir as R&#8217; Meir was the one who established the blessing of &#8220;shelo asani isha&#8221; as is explained in Menachos 43B. This is because the measure of women was light in </em>his <em>eyes, because the thinness of their mind, as it says in Avodah Zara 18B that R&#8217; Meir fled from the Land of Israel to Babylonia due to his shame as a result of his wife Bruria. (</em>According to Rashi in Avoda Zara, R&#8217; Meir was challenged by his wife Bruria regarding his assertion that women had inferior minds to men. R&#8217; Meir wanted to show that the principle was correct and so he responded by having one of his students seduce Bruria. She resisted for a while but eventually she relented. When she came to her senses, she was so upset that she hanged herself. When R&#8217; Meir discovered her, he fled to Babylonia.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Additionally, because he sinned with that one woman as it is described in Seder Hadoros</em> (I am not familiar with this reference), <em>and for this reason, the text in Menachos</em> (that teaches us to make the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em>) <em>is R&#8217; Meir and not R&#8217; Yehuda</em> (apparently, the text of this Talmudic passage was in dispute).</p>
<p>What is the Torah Temimah saying?</p>
<p>First of all, many different apologetics have been used to explain the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em>. The gist of all of them is the women are either equal or superior to men and the blessing is not indicative of a negative feeling toward women in the Talmud. The Torah Temimah is saying that no amount of apologetics can explain R&#8217; Meir&#8217;s opinion and halachic rulings about women. He did have an issue with women. It was part of who he was.</p>
<p>Thus, it seems a bit disingenuous to say that R&#8217; Meir really thought women were superior to men and that the blessing is not meant to establish women as inferior to men. The Torah Temimah is connecting his halachic rulings with his life experiences. He interpreted Avraham&#8217;s blessing of &#8220;ba&#8217;kol&#8221; as <em>not having a daughter</em><em>! </em>So while I think it is fair to say that the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em> and the dictum of <em>nashim datan kalot</em> are not as nefarious as some people may feel (as I have written previously: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/01/11/apropos-of-nothing-well-maybe-something-rabbi-julie-schonfeld-edition/">Apropos of Nothing (well… maybe something): Rabbi Julie Schonfeld Edition</a>), I also think it is fair to be honest, and the Torah Temimah is telling us that R&#8217; Meir in particular had a feeling about women that was negative.</p>
<p>I think that is unquestionably a fair inference from the Torah Temimah.</p>
<p>I now present a bit of speculation.</p>
<p>It is possible that the Torah Temimah was trying to distinguish R&#8217; Meir&#8217;s opinion from the other rabbis. It is possible that part of the point over here is that it was R&#8217; Meir <em>and only R&#8217; Meir</em> that had these opinions about women and it came from a confluence of events and issues that arose in his life. In other words, not all rabbis agree with R&#8217; Meir that <em>nashim datan kalot. </em>It was his opinion but not everyone agreed.</p>
<p>I admit that there are a plethora of other examples in the Talmud that portray women less than admirably. But as far as the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em> and the principle of<em> nashim datan kalot</em>, they may not have been as universally held as some believe. I think the Torah Temimah is trying to do this, at least obliquely. But as I said, it is speculation. Certainly, it is interesting food for thought.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
