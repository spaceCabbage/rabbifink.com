				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7218" alt="616hOnPIlZL._SL1000_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/616hOnPIlZL._SL1000_-186x300.jpg" width="186" height="300" /></a>I received a review copy of the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> siddur a few weeks ago. Over the last few weeks I have been test driving the siddur.</p>
<p>For starters, I have never used such a beautiful prayer book. The pages are laid out very well. The typography is excellent and a pleasure to read, no italics thankfully. We are given basic instructions for the service throughout and I found them to be accurate and useful. The translation was decent enough. There were some odd choices, but it&#8217;s like a happy marriage between Artscroll and Koren. What sets apart <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is the photos.</p>
<p>Many of us have seen their &#8220;benchers&#8221; with gorgeous illustrative photos. That concept has now been extended to the Shabbat siddur. It is not without careful consideration and considerable hemming and hawing that the photos were deemed appropriate. Several writers in the introductory remarks justify the inclusion of photos in the siddur. Personally, I think it&#8217;s an acceptable idea and found using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> with its photos mostly a positive experience. Praying with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is an interesting journey and I appreciated the effort to explain the use of photos in the siddur.</p>
<p><span id="more-7054"></span></p>
<p>What struck me most about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> was that it does not idealize charedim. I know this sounds odd when talking about a siddur, but the photos editorialize the text. The ideals expressed in the photos are very Zionist, very religious, and very un-charedi.</p>
<p>For example, we photos of women learning gemara. We see young women IDF soldiers as we sing Eishes Chayil. The elderly man from <em>Na&#8217;ar hayisi, v&#8217;gam zakanti </em>is a non-charedi man as well. Where there are photos of young boys learning Torah, we have young girls learning Torah on the opposing page. There are even photos of women dancing. The photo for <em>sefiras ha&#8217;omer </em>is a field, not a <em>sefirot </em>or any other Zohar centric imagery. Even the Shabbos food in the photos is not charedi. No cholent and kugel here. It&#8217;s like a Mediterranean style feast.</p>
<p>There are scant picture of charedim. The photos of charedim that are in the siddur do not glorify the usualy hallmarks of charedi society. One photo of charedim is of a yeshiva boy dancing at a wedding. Another photo is the famous photo of a rabbi being leered and jeered at by Nazi officers as he stands in his talis and tefilin. It&#8217;s weird using a religious book with so little charedi influence. We are so accustomed to orthodox Judaism being a charedi centric religion. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> turns that on its head. Religious Zionism is seen as the ideal in this siddur.</p>
<p>I took issue with a few of the editorial choices. First, the verse <em>poseach es yadecha umasbia l&#8217;chol chai ratzon </em>is illustrated in the siddur just as it is illustrated in the bencher. We see third world children with hungry eyes and smiling faces on this page. It&#8217;s disconcerting for two reasons. 1) There is tremendous hunger in third world countries. It is ironic at best to be using these photos for this verse. 2. It&#8217;s makes the African, Southeast Asian, and Indian children look like props. Almost everyone else in the siddur is Jewish. Why use these third world children here? It&#8217;s odd. It leads to another strange editorial choice. For the phrase <em>yakiru v&#8217;yedu kol yoshvei tevel </em>they show Buddhists and some Asian people looking upward as if to imply they now see God. I don&#8217;t like this choice either. We have fellow Jews who have yet to discover or believe in God, why are we shifting the focus to these other people?<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Another quirk is that almost all the liturgy about the Exodus and redemption is reinterpreted to refer to the Holocaust and the State of Israel through photos. In other words, as you are reading about our bondage in Egypt you see Holocaust photos. And as you read about the redemption and ancient entry to the Land of Canaan, you see Zionist pioneers in the modern Israel. Non-Zionists might find this disconcerting. But I would hope that it could subversively influence skeptics about Israel to see the parallels and perhaps embrace the State of Israel more fully.</p>
<p>Of course more of the photos are of outer space and nature panoramas. These photos are not editorial at all and I believe greatly enhance one&#8217;s appreciation of the liturgy.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is a great &#8220;change-up&#8221; siddur. I would not use it every week because I think the photos would fade into the pages and we would not even notice them anymore. But I certainly recommend buying at least one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> siddur and sharing it with your family. Let a different family member use it each week and I am sure your appreciation for the Shabbos prayers will increase.</p>
<p>Buy on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7137" alt="DoubleLife-Cover" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DoubleLife-Cover-231x300.jpg" width="231" height="300" /></a>I received a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife: One Family, Two Faiths and a Journey of Hope</a> a few weeks ago. It took a while for me to actually  sit down and read the book but I read it over the weekend and will do my usual review with a side of analysis on the book.</p>
<p>The story is quite intriguing. A Jewish man who makes a living playing music at Church and a Christian woman who does the same fall in love, get married, and end up as orthodox Jews. There&#8217;s a lot of blanks to fill in and the book does a fair job of telling their story.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to notice the book&#8217;s most obvious shtick right away. The entire story is told in letters between Harold and Gayle. Harold&#8217;s letters are written in regular typeset and Gayle&#8217;s are in italics. I found this very distracting. I don&#8217;t like italics. But that might be a personal quirk.</p>
<p>The larger issue is that it seems so artificial. Everything is written in letter format. Even things that couples obviously already know about one another. Normal people do not write letters to each other that ask the big questions like &#8220;will we have a Christmas tree or Hanukkah bush in our home&#8221;. Normal couples do not express themselves in letters to the exclusion of anything else. Yet, the book expects us to believe that all these important conversations took place via letters. Either these are real letters, which is just odd or it&#8217;s a gimmick. Making things worse, in order for this to work logistically, the two of them are almost never together. He is writing about his life, she is writing about her life, but because of the format we rarely get a feel for what life is like for the two of them when they are together. Some people might like this format choice, but I did not. It was weird.</p>
<p><span id="more-7134"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> tells the reader a lot about how difficult life can be for intermarried couples. They really don&#8217;t fit in anywhere. The Christian community does not embrace Howard and Gayle and we all know how skeptical the Jewish community can be of intermarried couples. I was surprised that the more liberal branches of Judaism were so antagonistic toward Howard and Gayle. It could just be that this was their experience and others have had different experiences. But reading the book, one would think that Reform and Conservative rabbis and communities are not welcoming to intermarried couples. This might be true in general, but all one can say from the book is that this was the experience of this couple. I would not say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> dishonestly portrays the positions of other denominations to puff up orthodox Judaism, but it at some points it did feel like that a little bit.</p>
<p>The punchline of the book is that the one place that welcomed Howard and Gayle more than any other was the orthodox Jewish community. In the end, despite their reservations, especially Gayle&#8217;s, the couple settled in the orthodox Jewish community. Gayle had a full orthodox conversion and the couple is has been living as orthodox Jews ever since. I do admit to completely breaking down during the conversion scene in the book. It was very emotional and I felt that the book did an excellent job making the moment work as a true climax of the story.</p>
<p>I wish the book would have spent some more time dealing with the theology of becoming an orthodox Jew. Gayle struggles with it quite a bit and we are never really told what changed her mind from resistance to acceptance of orthodox Judaism. I suspect it was mostly an emotional decision but I thought we should have heard a bit more about the transition.</p>
<p>The book tells a great story, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> also seeks to carve out a place for intermarried couples in orthodox Judaism. On the one hand their story seems to say that they are welcome with open arms, but on the other hand it seems that more resources are needed to handle these situations in the orthodox community. To that end <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> promotes the website created by Howard and Gayle for intermarried couples <a href="http://j-journey.org">j-journey.org</a>. The site seems to focus on orthodox conversion exclusively.</p>
<p>This all leads me to the piercing unasked question raised by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. What should be the Jewish approach to intermarriage. In a generation where more Jews intermarry than &#8220;intramarry,&#8221; what is the best way to handle it?</p>
<p>As it stands now, we discourage intermarriage so vociferously that orthodox rabbis will not officiate the ceremony of an intermarried couple. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> seems to indicate that Reform and Conservative rabbis will not officiate either. What chance do we have of ingratiating an intermarried couple back into Judaism if we can&#8217;t participate in their wedding? I am not saying that we should ignore halacha, God forbid. I am only saying that we stack the deck against the intermarried couple that it becomes extremely difficult to include them in our communities. It is something that we need to work on and I think the Bermans are doing good work by trying to make orthodox Judaism more inclusive for intermarried couples.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. It&#8217;s worthwhile to read the book just to sense of the difficulties that intermarried couples encounter in their spiritual journeys. But more importantly, the book raises questions we must answer about how we handle intermarriage in the modern world. If you have read the book, I welcome your thoughts as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7081" alt="91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_-230x300.jpg" width="230" height="300" /></a>Over the weekend it was reported that a teacher in an orthodox Jewish school in Seattle has been charged with molesting two six year old girls in his class. It is suspected that this fellow molested more than just the two girls but he is only charged with molesting the two girls.</p>
<p>Sex abuse happens everywhere. It is no indictment of a school, community, or family if sex abuse occurs. The test is how sex abuse is dealt with. The most important question is whether the victim is able to articulate that they have been abused and that the victim has a safe place to talk about the abuse. If no one comes forward there is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>It takes great courage to come forward. But more importantly, it takes education to come forward. Our best defense against abuse is quite simply our children. If they are equipped with the tools necessary to prevent molestation and report it when it happens we have our first two lines of defense in place.</p>
<p>The prosecutor in the case in Seattle attributes the girls&#8217; willingness to come forward and their ability to articulate what happened to a book that is the brainchild of Rabbi Yakov Horowitz, written by Bracha Goetz and illustrated by Tova Leff. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a>. Incredibly, it took years for this book to see the light of day. But now it is endorsed by leading Torah authorities and it must be in every home and every school.</p>
<p><span id="more-7080"></span></p>
<p>In a sensitive way, the book gives children the tools to prevent abuse. When the book was released, I bought several copies of the book for my home and anywhere else I thought it necessary.</p>
<p>Just consider for a moment how incredible it is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> helped end a cycle of abuse in Seattle. It could do the same in your community. Get the book.</p>
<p>In places where abuse is not reported and not even acknowledged there is too much space for predators to wreak havoc. It is a matter of <em>sakanas nefashos, </em>we must act now. Our children must be educated. There are no excuses. We must educate our most insular communities on the harms of abuse and help them help themselves get out from under the cycle of abuse.</p>

The book also keeps children safe generally. Rabbi Horowitz shared with me a letter that he received from a learning disabled child thanking him for the book as it helped him in several situations. The letter is so sweet and innocent, it brought tears to my eyes. It is time for us to take this challenge and grab it by the horns. The first step is buying and using this book.</p>
<p>Aside from the book, Rabbi Horowitz has an excellent video on keeping our children safe. Watch that here: <a href="http://youtu.be/LWQHaInsCGk" target="_blank">YouTube</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6824" alt="61oREwM629L._SL1000_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/61oREwM629L._SL1000_.jpg" width="235" height="346" /></a>After the bar exam, the first book that I wanted to read from my growing list of &#8220;Books to Read&#8221; was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius: Elijah of Vilna and the Making of Modern Judaism</a> by Eliyahu Stern. It was a good choice. As usual, I will review and also discuss some of the parts of the book I found most interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius</a> is as much a biography of the Vilna Gaon as it is an examination of the Gaon&#8217;s milieu. Stern compares and contrasts the Gaon with central figures from history and his contemporaries in an effort to paint a more complete picture of the Gaon. It seems that Stern is trying to portray the Gaon as a bit of a reformer who can be associated with modern orthodox Judaism as opposed to modern haredi Judaism.</p>
<p>Honestly, after reading the book I was not convinced of this. It sounds almost ridiculous and the book does not provide a compelling enough case to change my mind. But it was a valiant effort. In this respect the book was a failure. However <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius</a> is a monumental success so many other ways that the thesis of the book is almost an irrelevant side show.</p>
<p>One interesting side show was the discussion of the centrality of Creation Ex Nihilo. According to Stern, the Gaon held that there was no creation from nothing, rather all creation was from &#8220;something eternal&#8221;. This goes to the phenomena of certain interpretations gaining popularity and the rest of the interpretations becoming dinosaurs. The Gaon disagreed with Rambam on Creation Ex Nihilo and I never even heard about it. Fascinating.<span id="more-6823"></span></p>
<p>My favorite chapter in the book compared and contrasted the Gaon and Moses Mendelsohn. Most people assume that Mendelsohn was a reformer and the Gaon was a traditionalist. In some ways that is true. But as far as the way they interpreted the Torah in their commentaries, Mendelsohn expressed much greater deference to Chazal than the Gaon. In his Biur, Mendelsohn argued in favor of Rabbinical interpretations of the Torah in order to distinguish Judaism from the Christian neighbors to his fellow German Jews. Emancipation from the Ghetto brought on challenges of debating and dealing with Christian scholars. Thus, his greatest weapon was to argue for the Rabbinic tradition. The Gaon was cloistered in Vilna. There were no theological challenges from Christians. The challenges were different. The Gaon gave his own interpretations to verses where he didn&#8217;t want to go with the interpretation of Chazal.</p>
<p>The Rashbam is known to disregard many of Chazal&#8217;s interpretations. Mendelsohn was very wary of the Rashbam. He didn&#8217;t like. The Gaon loved the Rashbam and used the Rashbam&#8217;s methodology even where the Rashbam himself did not. The Gaon had no problem saying that Deuteronomy was prophesied by Moses, as opposed to dictated at Sinai, while Mendelsohn would not even concede that the last 8 verses in the Torah were written by Joshua.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Gaon encouraged a translation of Euclid into Hebrew where Mendelsohn translated the Torah into German. Both men were influenced by their social conditions. In the end, this made Mendelsohn into an apologist and the Gaon into a relevant leader.</p>
<p>I posted an excerpt of the book on Facebook. It generated a lot of discussion there so I will direct you there for the comments. (Here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101421218867825" target="_blank">Facebook.com</a>) The excerpt contrasts the Gaon&#8217;s defiant stance against Hasidut and ambivalence toward the Haskala. This is further reflected by his rabbinic legacy in R&#8217; Chaim Volozhin and the Netziv who accepted on the fence <em>maskilim</em> into the Volozhiner Yeshiva. Much of the Gaon&#8217;s opposition to Hasidut was based on the fairly recent memory of Shabtai Tzvi. But the Gaon did not have a problem with the Ramchal and R&#8217; Yonason Eybeshutz who were rumored Shabatean sympathizers. His problem was the movement of Hasidut.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting is that contemporary Hasidic movements want to include the Gaon in their worldview and sometimes reinterpret or apologize for the Gaon. It&#8217;s hard to take these ideas seriously when one has the full picture of the Gaon&#8217;s approach to Hasidut.</p>
<p>Although the Gaon was a great kabbalist, it seems that he was not a mystic in the sense that he would not emphasize or rely upon modern miracles or stories of fantastic occurrences. Some like to attribute his greatness to a magical ability or a special soul. The Gaon&#8217;s students taught that the Gaon was a self made man. Anyone could be the Gaon. He had no gifts or supernatural abilities. His greatness came from his dedication and commitment to Torah and study. His intense discipline and anti-social tendencies opened the doors to greatness. Not something that was given to him from on High. Further, Stern argues that he rejected the Daas Torah model that was made popular by the Chasam Sofer.</p>
<p>In the end, the book is an excellent read. The Notes section is almost as thick as the content section. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius</a> is an impressive book that offers much more than what it purports to do. I highly recommend it. If you need a book for some Pesach reading, pick one up today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6707" alt="513723" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/513723-261x300.jpg" width="261" height="300" /></a>I planned this post for a little while, and it dovetails perfectly in the wake of yesterday&#8217;s post about the Op-Ed by Rabbi Sacks (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/25/a-small-addition-to-rabbi-sacks-beautiful-article-in-the-ny-times/">A Small Addition to Rabbi Sacks’ Beautiful Article in the NY Times</a>).</em></p>
<p>The best book I read this year was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists: A Non-believer&#8217;s Guide to the Uses of Religion</a> by Alain de Botton. The author is a Jewish atheist and apparently a direct descendant of the author of the Lechem Mishnah commentary on Maimonides&#8217; Mishnah Torah. The book is excellent and I highly recommend that everyone read it.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the book is written for atheists. I think believers should read this book at least as much as atheists should read it. The book tries to show that there is a lot that atheists can learn from religion. Generally speaking, de Botton argues that even if religion is  complete bunk there is a reason it developed, evolved, and flourishes. There are evolutionary needs that religion addresses. Religion serves a very important role in the scheme of man&#8217;s existence and when people abandon religion as atheists, they risk losing the very important evolutionary benefits of religion.</p>
<p>In other words, atheists cannot abandon the principles of religion simply because they disbelieve in God. In fact, it almost makes no sense to do that. An atheist must believe that religion evolved as a response to a human need because the atheists does not believe that religion could possibly be a revelation from God since God does not exist according to the atheist! It follows that according to atheists, religion is a human response to some innate needs and its development and success are vital to the success and progress of humanity. Excising religion from the human experience may be necessary for the atheist, but it is fraught with risks. There are elements of religion that are necessary for human development and without religion, those needs may not be met.<span id="more-6667"></span></p>
<p>So the book then goes on to describe some of the humanistic benefits of various religions. Most of the focus is on Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. I found the references to Judaism very fascinating and enlightening. The author even uses some of the harshest victims of atheistic criticism as examples of worthy ideas that should be emulated. For example, he uses mikvah, (yes mikvah!), as an example of attaching ritual and meaning to washing. He says that there is something valuable in attaching bathing to renewal and associating outer washing with inner purity. As orthodox Jews, we may scoff at this humanistic approach to mikvah and it may not be sufficient to allay some of the discomfort that some orthodox Jewish women have with mikvah, but it is refreshing to see a non-believer try to find beauty and meaning in this practice.</p>
<p>Another great example in the book is his section on forgiveness. Yom Kippur is an ingenious way of reconnecting people. It is a day where we are forced to reconcile with our past. Non-believers need such a day as well.</p>
<p>Most importantly, religion creates community and responsibility toward one another. The book mentions Jewish weddings and Bar Mitzvah celebrations as important rituals within a community that should be emulated by non-believers.</p>
<p>The follow up point to each example is that atheists must create analogous practices and rituals for their lives in order to satisfy their needs that are not being met by the absence of religion in their lives. The book proposes cathedrals for atheists, yearly celebrations of bounty, and other corollaries to religious practices for atheists. The proposals are fantastic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mostly theoretical book because I don&#8217;t see how any of this would every come into being. But if it would happen, I think it would be great for society.</p>
<p>Although the book is written for atheists, I think there is something important here for believers as well. We need to appreciate the depth and beauty of our religious practices. We need to see how to a non-believer many of our practices are useful even if God did not exist. To us, who believe God does exist, the benefits of religion are even greater. We need to appreciate how incredibly useful our religion is to our psyche and wellbeing and we need to thank God for giving us such a wonderful way of life to satisfy those needs. This is the true value of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> to the believer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not recommending orthopraxy. I am suggesting that the believer take into account all that religion does for the believer in a religious but also in a secular, psychological, and evolutionary way. We need to realize that what we are doing was given to us by God and it goes beyond just ritual or Divine command that has no non-religious benefit. We should acknowledge and explore the potential humanistic reasons for practicing orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The book also can serve as a bit of a bridge between atheists and believers. It gives us common ground and serves as an antidote to the Dawkins inspired derision of religion. I&#8217;d pay a lot of money to see a debate between Dawkins and de Botton. I also wish the Chief Rabbi would have read this book and incorporated some of its lessons in his Op-Ed earlier this week.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> enough. It is a great book for believers and non-believers alike.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9652295787/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9652295787"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5057" title="kosher-jesus" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/kosher-jesus.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>I&#8217;ll be honest. There is very little that I like about Rabbi Shmuley. I rarely agree with his perspectives on life, Jews and Judaism. But recently I find myself defending him in my mind against the latest round of accusations against him.</p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuley has written a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9652295787/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9652295787" target="_blank">Kosher Jesus</a>. The book is a retelling of Jesus based on some (fringe) historical research. The book portrays the true Jesus as a man who was mostly a Torah abiding Jew but sought to establish a niche within Judaism for his personal views and style. He was later, much later, hijacked as a deity by followers of his teachings in an effort to rebel against Judaism and start a new religion.</p>
<p>At least that is what I was able to gather from the descriptions of the book on various websites. That&#8217;s because, despite what you may think, <em>THE BOOK HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED</em>.</p>
<p>I know this might come as a shock seeing as how Rabbi Shmuley has already been branded as a heretic for writing a book that almost no one  has read. In article after article, I have seen calls for Rabbi Shmuley to be ousted from Judaism or worse because of what he has ostensibly written. And this is why I come to his defense.<span id="more-5056"></span></p>
<p>Screeds against a man who has written a book that has not been read by the ones raving against him. <a href="http://zootorah.com/controversy/controversy.html" target="_blank">I have seen this movie already</a>. It doesn&#8217;t end well for anyone.</p>
<p>Criticism and discussion are important parts of any functioning society. Just open the Talmud and you&#8217;ll see many opinions and reasoning that explains those opinions that we do not follow today. It&#8217;s a discussion. There is argument. But what you won&#8217;t find is rabbis calling for someone&#8217;s head because of a book title or brief dust jacket description. Further, if there is a point to be made, make the point! Yelling very loudly that Rabbi Shmuley is X and Y and therefore A, B and C must happen to him sounds like the ravings of a lunatic.</p>
<p>How about this?</p>
<p>Read the book. Write a critique of the book based on actual research and facts. Then we can have a mature discussion about the issues.</p>
<p><strong>My two cents:</strong></p>
<p>I reserve judgment until I have read the book. (If I read the book at all.) But I am curious why this is the book Rabbi Shmuley chose to write. I know what he says in interviews or in his articles but it still doesn&#8217;t add up. I am concerned that the book may have just been written to be provacative, to gain publicity and generate controversy. I could be wrong. But that&#8217;s just how it smells to me.</p>
<p><strong>One more cent:</strong></p>
<p>In order for Jesus to become kosher, everything that Christians teach must be wrong. Is that really a road we want to go down?</p>
<p><strong>Someone else&#8217;s two cents:</strong></p>
<p>Read Rabbi Gil&#8217;s excellent post on the issue of a kosher Jesus here: <a href="http://torahmusings.com/2012/01/three-easy-steps-to-a-kosher-jesus/" target="_blank">Hirhurim</a></p>

This is not a normal book review. It is really a more of a reflection upon reading a wonderful book.</p>
<p>A friend suggested I read <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345377060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0345377060">The Search for God at Harvard</a> and gave me a copy of the book a little while ago. I finally got around to reading <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345377060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0345377060">The Search for God at Harvard</a> and really enjoyed it. There are some very important thing that I learned from the book and I recommend reading it if you have not yet read it yourself.</p>
<p><a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345377060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0345377060">The Search for God at Harvard</a> is supposed to be the story of New York Times journalist, Ari Goldman&#8217;s year at Harvard Divinity School. While much of the book focuses on his year there, the book is really about some of Goldman&#8217;s issues with religion, issues with his parents and his rise in through the ranks at the NY Times. In other words, the backdrop for the book is Goldman&#8217;s year at the Div School, but the bulk of the storytelling in the book has nothing to do with what he learned there. I would have liked more.</p>
<p>But that is my only criticism of the book; wanting more can hardly be a criticism.</p>
<p>Ari Goldman was raised as an orthodox Jew in the 60&#8242;s. As Goldman notices, much has changed in the orthodox Jewish community in the last 50 years. Goldman remains committed to orthodox Judaism, but like everyone, is not perfect. He takes some liberties with his observance. This is an attitude that has mostly been purged from orthodox Judaism. Many people think this is a good thing. I do not. Goldman&#8217;s story is a prime illustration why.<span id="more-4370"></span></p>
<p>I cried two times while reading <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345377060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0345377060">The Search for God at Harvard</a>.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t help but notice that Goldman feels cheated by his parents who divorced when he was 5 years old. He makes it clear that he still feels the pain of that 5 year old who lost his beloved friday night Shabbos dinners with his parents. So when he has a moment where he connects with his son and realizes how lucky he is to be a father it seems to give him a bit solace. You can feel him healing. The writing is that good and the point is so poignant that I could not help but to tear up. But this was a sidebar to the book. I think the second time I cried shows how the social changes in orthodox Judaism over the last 50 years may not be for the best.</p>
<p>The biggest tear-jerker for me was at the end of the book. Goldman struggles to remain observant throughout the book. He struggles as single male in the big city. He struggles as a journalist who may need to work on Shabbos. He even feels Divine Intervention when his first real journalism gig at the NY Times does not require he work on Shabbos. He feels connected to orthodox Judaism. It is his Judaism.</p>
<p>After the year at the Div School, Goldman and his wife and son move to Westchester County. They join a modern orthodox synagogue. The rabbi hears that Goldman has quite a talent as a cantor and asks him if he would lead one of the services on the high holidays. At first Goldman is honored but he declines. Eventually he acquiesces to pressure to take the job. He feels validation that he has been able to navigate the difficulties of balancing modernity with an ancient tradition. But some members of the shul are not happy. They find some of his activities are not in consonance with Jewish law. They said he worked on Shabbos, he ate (kosher food) in non-Kosher restaurants, he read the New Testament, his son was named for a non-Jew etc. In Goldman&#8217;s mind, these were struggles. Sometimes he won, sometimes he lost. In Goldman&#8217;s eyes these were battles. To his coreligionists they were seen as compromises. And they threatened the sheltered world of orthodox Judaism. That year, Goldman did not lead the services. In fact he did not even go to the synagogue because he was so hurt.</p>
<p>That was when I cried.</p>
<p>The postscript to the high holidays story was that the other synagogue members eventually apologized. They told Goldman that they too participate in many of this &#8220;objectionable&#8221; activities. But they keep them quiet. They don&#8217;t discuss them. If had kept his mouth shut he would have been just fine.</p>
<p>Goldman concludes his book with what I feel to be the most significant point in <a id="static_txt_preview" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345377060/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0345377060">The Search for God at Harvard</a>. After the ethnic pride movements of the 70&#8242;s, religions began to shift to more fundamentalist views in the 80&#8242;s. This continued through the 90&#8242;s and brings us to where we are today. Intolerance for co-coreligionists and &#8220;other-religionists&#8221; became more pronounced in the 80&#8242;s than it was prior to the 80&#8242;s. President Reagan brought religion to fore of policy and discourse in America.</p>
<p>In orthodox Judaism a similar phenomena happened as well. Orthodox Judaism became more narrow. Many activities, positions, policies, beliefs, modes of dress, aspirations among other things that were previously accepted in the broad spectrum of orthodox Judaism were expunged. People and communities were told to move to the right, or move on. It has not let up since. In matters of theology, practice, social and religious, the orthodox Judaism of my grandparents is long gone.</p>
<p>Am I crazy for trying to bring it back? Maybe. But that won&#8217;t stop me from trying.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439130094/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439130094"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4056" title="In the Valley of the Shadow" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/51yMuk-0HRL._SL500_AA300_.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>James Kugel is a modern Bible Critic AND an orthodox Jew. He believes in God. He follows the Code of Jewish Law. Yet, he is able to reconcile all that with a purely academic approach the the Bible. It is a hard line but he is able to pull it off.</p>
<p>Whenever I have seen questions asked of him about how he can reconcile the two, he always remains unapologetically committed to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have heard a lot of criticism directed his way, by (even more moderate) orthodox Jewish rabbis for his research and teachings causing orthodox Jews that cannot toe the hard line to drop orthodox Judaism. This is really a criticism of some of his students, but I can understand how it is fair to attribute some of their demise to Kugel. Although, it should noted that Kugel has written a book to help those students called &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0801859433/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0801859433" target="_blank">On Being a Jew</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>I have never read any of his books. But I have read many articles by him and about him. Mostly as it relates to his being able to reconcile his academic achievements and his beliefs. Most of his books are academic and focus on modern readings of the bible by removing or discussing the assumptions made by believers when they read the bible.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439130094/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439130094" target="_blank">His most recent book</a> is different.<span id="more-4054"></span></p>
<p>A few years ago, Kugel was diagnosed with Cancer. It is now in remission but he published a book of his meditations, thoughts and feelings as his life hung in the balance and through his treatments.</p>
<p>Every single review of the book that I have seen, speaks glowingly of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439130094/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1439130094" target="_blank">book</a>.</p>
<p>Reading some of these reviews has produced some real good food for thought for everyone. Jewish. Orthodox. And otherwise.</p>
<p>For example, on the nexus of science and religion, this review writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many studies of religion, he observes, begin with the premise that once we understand the neuroscience and evolutionary biology behind religious ideas, we can move on free of delusion. But this is akin to suggesting that once we understand human courtship behavior, we can stop the nonsense of falling in love. If a sense of the Great Unknown really is a basic aspect of human nature, we can hardly expect it to go away simply because we have explained its origins.</em></p>
<p>And in the next paragraph when discussing the age old age question of why bad things happen to good people, Kugel answers one question with another question:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Why, in spite of everything, do people persist in believing that life is ultimately fair? For Kugel, the answer has to do with the starkness of religious experience. In a world where man is very small and God (or the gods, or the universe) is very big, there is no room for moral ambiguity or indifference. There are only good and evil, and God must ultimately be good.</em></p>
<p>In the NY Times review, Kugel is quoted about the difference between how scientists view religion and how religious people actually utilize religion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The scientists “have misunderstood the most fundamental element of religious belief,” he declares. To the religious [...] religion is an experience more than a cosmology. “It is not God’s sovereignty over the entire universe that is at issue so much as his sovereignty over the cubic centimeter of space that sits just in front of our own noses,” he writes. “That is to say, religion is first of all about fitting into the world and fitting into one’s borders.</em></p>
<p>At the book event at Hillel Harvard, where Kugel is a professor, one student remarked:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What makes Kugel so prescient is that he presents a religious philosophy that is fundamentally different from the Western, and especially the Harvard, model.</em></p>
<p>It seems that people are surprised and appreciative of Kugel&#8217;s approach. For many, religion has become synonymous with fundamentalism and perhaps even a backwards closed-mindedness. I vehemently disagree with that assertion.</p>
<p>On this point, Kugel and I are aligned. And in my experience, people do appreciate the Kugel approach to religion from what I have been able to glean from these reviews of his latest book. I hope more thoughtful books on religion will be published by out-of-the-box orthodox Jewish thinkers. It is a genre that has suffered a lot over the last half-century.</p>
<p>A little reversal of this trend would be a good thing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Book-cover1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3261" title="Book cover1" src="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Book-cover1-239x300.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="210" /></a>Jon Stewart wrote a cleverly titled book called &#8220;Earth: A visitors guide to the human race&#8221;. I have not read the book and I probably won&#8217;t read it. However, I saw this great excerpt on The Jewish Journal of Los Angeles website.</p>
<p>The book provides a key to understanding all types of humans. Being a member of the tribe, Stewart claims to have some inside information on understanding Jewish people. The Jewish Journal excerpted a part of the section of Judaism and I have copied it to share it with you.</p>
<p>To be honest, I find it a little lacking and only mildly offensive.</p>
<p>First we have a handy flowchart:<span id="more-3259"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Judaism-Organized.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3260" title="Judaism-Organized" src="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Judaism-Organized.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="569" /></a>Some of my thoughts on the flowchart:</p>
<p><strong>Orthodox</strong>: Not all Orthodox Jews revere &#8220;Rebbes&#8221;. That is chasidic Judaism. True, chasidic Jews get the headlines and are easy to spot because they dress funny, but they are just segment of Orthodox Judaism. It has always bothered me that the average non-Jew thinks that chasidic Jews are the &#8220;real Jews&#8221;. More on that in a second.</p>
<p>Next we have the &#8220;Crown Heights Assemblyman&#8221;. Take my annoyance that chasidic Jews are perceived as the &#8220;real Jews&#8221; and multiply that by a million and you have my annoyance that Chabad Jews are considered the &#8220;Even More Real Jews&#8221;. Blech.</p>
<p>Whitefish? Do non-orthodox Jews really think we like whitefish?</p>
<p>Men &#8211;&gt; Boys &#8211;&gt; Women: Unfortunately, this criticism is fair. Here&#8217;s hoping that changes soon&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Conservative</strong>: I think Harvard should be a little higher&#8230;</p>
<p>Wait, they also have women beneath men? Really?</p>
<p><strong>Reform</strong>: This one is the most offensive. But I do agree with the Protestant Golf Club sentiment.</p>
<p>Some more excerpts from the Jewish Journal article:</p>
<p><strong>Mezuzah</strong><br />
In keeping with the Biblical law, Jews affixed Mezuzahs to their doorposts so the Chinese delivery boys knew where to go.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer</strong><br />
“Please protect me from violent pogroms/offensive stereotypes/negative reviews of my Broadway show or novel/ negligence lawsuits from my podiatry practice.” (Typical)</p>
<p>“If I leave now I can make it home in time for “Friday Night Lights”. (Reform)</p>
<p><strong>A Flock Divided</strong><br />
Primary religious divisions:<br />
Reform, Conservative, Orthodox</p>
<p><strong>Areas of Disagreement</strong><br />
•	How Jewish was “too Jewish”?<br />
•	Kosher socks, a bit too much?<br />
•	Women: unclean or rabbinical candidates?</p>
<p><strong>Kippa</strong><br />
Jewish boys and men wore yarmulkes to symbolize their subordination to their mothers.</p>
<p>Hahahaha.</p>
<p>Jon Stewart is a funny guy&#8230;</p>
