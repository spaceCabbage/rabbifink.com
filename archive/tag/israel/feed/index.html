				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another summer in Israel, another war. This war is playing out in the pages of the Jewish media, and this time we&#8217;re our own worst enemy. Intramural fighting between passionate commentators and rabbis has a place in our culture. In the Talmud it is called the milchamta shel Torah. But sometimes, zealots for our cause can creates a war that should have been settled patiently by cooler heads.</p>
<p>We are being told there is a battle between the Chief Rabbinate and Rabbi Riskin. I am not so convinced, but some things are abundantly clear. <a href="http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/r-riskin-versus-the-chief-rabbinate-a-dose-of-reality/" target="_blank">Supporters of the Chief Rabbinate and their brand of more conservative Orthodox Judaism</a> are concerned about more liberal Orthodoxy. <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel/.premium-1.658189" target="_blank">Supporters of more liberal Orthodoxy</a> are uncomfortable with the de facto institutionalized rabbinic authority given to the Rabbinate. These are legitimate differences of philosophy that are not particularly new, nor very likely to be solved by the current controversy.</p>
<p>If we scratch beneath the surface, something disturbing emerges. It seems that the entire controversy has been manufactured by supporters of both sides with little concern for fact checking or measured reaction.<span id="more-9280"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.658051" target="_blank">Haaretz reports</a>: <em>“On Monday, the Chief Rabbinate Council, headed by Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi David Lau, refused to extend Riskin’s tenure in the post and demanded that he present himself at the council’s next meeting to discuss the issue. […]</em></p>
<p><em>“According to the Chief Rabbinate, the problem is strictly technical: Whereas younger rabbis’ appointments are usually renewed automatically, Riskin is over 75, and all rabbis over 75 are required to submit a written request for reappointment and then appear before the council. Riskin neither submitted a written request nor attended Monday’s council meeting, and therefore, his appointment couldn’t be renewed, it said.”</em></p>
<p>The second paragraph explains the first paragraph. The Chief Rabbinate is following its own protocols and thus they did not “refuse” to extend Rabbi Riskin’s tenure, nor did they “demand” he present himself for a meeting. This is what they are supposed to do under the circumstances.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/01/the-manufactured-controversy-between-the-chief-rabbinate-and-rabbi-riskin/7526-toysoldiers-06/" rel="attachment wp-att-9281"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9281" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7526-toysoldiers-06.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="7526-toysoldiers-06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Still, the request was seen as an admonishment and personal attack on Rabbi Riskin. After all, Rabbi Riskin holds many opinions that are far more liberal than the Rabbinate, so everyone just assumes this is a religiously motivated political attack.</p>
<p>The line in the sand was drawn and shots were fired from both sides of this controversy. Some lined up behind Rabbi Riskin to defend him against “inappropriate” treatment. Others defended the decision of Chief Rabbinate by pointing out how far Rabbi Riskin has veered from the traditional positions of Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>All of this based on virtually nothing! Put your weapons down everyone. There’s nothing to see here, yet.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/NGO-cites-chief-rabbinate-documents-showing-rabbis-rarely-summoned-for-tenure-extensions-404285" target="_blank">Rabbi Seth Farber from ITIM researched the issue</a> that we got any evidence based data. Rabbi Farber&#8217;s research discovered that rabbis are generally rubber stamped even if they are older than 75. Citing public record, Rabbi Farber argues that this is the first time the Rabbinate has made such a request. Thus, the assumption that the Rabbinate was snubbing Rabbi Riskin for ideological reasons was correct.</p>
<p>Fight on!</p>
<p>The Chief Rabbinate responded that all the previous cases were before the tenure of the new chief rabbis, and the new policy is to hold hearings for renewal of older rabbis. Further, the Chief Rabbinate claims that they also gave notice to the chief rabbi of Jerusalem that fitness hearings would be standard operating procedure in the new regime.</p>
<p>Oh, maybe not.</p>
<p>I have a general rule. When presented with a choice about how to explain something that bothers us, and one of the choices is a legitimate justification for the behavior and the other is assigns negative motivations and harmful intent to the behavior, choose the one that sees the act favorably. In other words, we can choose to be hurt by ambiguous behavior or we can choose to rationalize ambiguous behavior. Unless the only reasonable option is that the behavior was done to harm us, we have to choose the benevolent option. That doesn’t excuse ambiguous behavior that hurts us, but it does soften the sting of hateful intentions.</p>
<p>In this story, the Chief Rabbinate’s behavior is plausible and well within reasonable norms. Rabbis in their employ should be of fit mind and health. That’s a good policy. It’s true that creatively connecting the dots, reinterpreting their actions, adding unspoken motivations, and calling them liars will build a story that is insulting and unsettling, but that requires a lot of subjective interpretation and some conspiracy theory. On the other hand, if the hearing is pro-forma and Rabbi Riskin is being treated the same way the Chief Rabbinate will treat everyone else, the story is not disturbing at all. If they want to get rid of Rabbi Riskin, why do it in a profoundly offensive translucent manner? If this is their play to remove Rabbi Riskin, it’s pretty stupid. Since when is the Chief Rabbinate afraid to “own” offensive positions?</p>
<p>Our loud reaction to this story, by supporters on both sides, tells us more about ourselves than about the Chief Rabbinate and Rabbi Riskin. Too many people among the ranks of both sides are little bit too trigger happy. Perhaps it’s some form of religious warfare PTSD and the slightest noise sets us over the edge. It’s as if there are two armies, battle weapons drawn, just waiting for someone to fire, even if it’s inadvertent. We need to settle down. Rest our war machines. Talk to each other. Maybe share a Coke, or something. That always seems to work.</p>
<p>We will all have our answer in a month. The hearing is scheduled for the end of June, so all this hyperventilating seems a bit premature as well. However, even if the Chief Rabbinate discriminates against Rabbi Riskin and rules against him, that only determines whether Rabbi Riskin draws a government salary. That’s all. He can still be the rabbi. He can still be Orthodox. It sends a strong message of intolerance, but we already know the Chief Rabbinate and Rabbi Riskin are on opposite sides of a spectrum where tolerance is tenuous.</p>
<p>Personally, I strongly support Rabbi Riskin’s right to an opinion. I hate the idea that the Chief Rabbinate can effectively play the role of de facto Sanhedrin and establish universal standards of Orthodox Judaism. That is not acceptable to me. I am very hopeful that this will all have been wild speculation by soldiers of the Almighty suffering from PTSD and not the rare occasion where conspiracy theorists can say “just because I am paranoid, doesn’t mean I&#8217;m wrong.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, the Israeli Rabbinate granted their coveted Rabbinic ordination to several dozen new rabbis. A cousin of mine was among the celebrants and I was very happy for him upon this great achievement. This cousin is an American born charedi learning in Kollel. He kind of defies stereotypical categories &#8211; yes it runs in the family &#8211; but if you saw him, you would assume he was an idealistic charedi who is living a very simple Israeli lifestyle for the sake of Torah study. And that sort of fits.</p>
<p>When I saw photos of the event, I could not help but notice something remarkable that also defies stereotypes.<span id="more-8837"></span> The people celebrating their ordination that day were from every walk of Orthodox Jewish life.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/23/a-remarkable-rainbow-of-rabbis-2/rb1/" rel="attachment wp-att-8838"><img class="alignright wp-image-8838 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rb1.jpg?resize=600%2C375" alt="rb1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> It was uncanny. If you dream up almost any type of Orthodox Judaism, there was a guy from that version of Orthodox Judaism who received semicha that day. Truly, it was as much a celebration of ordination as it was a celebration of the diversity within Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The beauty of a rainbow is found in its vibrant colors. Each color stands out on its own and also bleeds into the next color so that it is impossible to say where one color starts and another ends. But all those colors are just refractions from the same light. That makes it even more beautiful. This ceremony celebrated one light that refracts into many colors and styles too. The light of God, Torah, and Judaism refracted into vibrant Orthodox Jewish communities. It was a beautiful rainbow.</p>
<p>I can think of no message more important and more powerful as we prepare for the High Holidays. Superficially, there are many ways to do Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. The packaging is different but the content is the same. The body may appear to be different, but at the soul level, it is all one. The packaging is flexible and malleable. The soul is eternal.</p>
<p>We approach the Days of Awe with an awesome responsibility for ourselves, our families, and each other. Everyone has different favorite colors. Color preferences are like opinions, everybody has them. But the colors themselves cannot bicker and fight about which is the true light. They are all just a sliver of true light. None are the light on their own and the light needs all of them.</p>
<p>Same goes for us.</p>
<p>Mazel tov to the varied recipients of Rabbinic ordination. Mazel tov to my cousin. Mazel tov to all of us. Their celebration is our celebration too.</p>
<p>Here is a small selection of the many photos from that day illustrating this point in living color. Photo Credits: <a href="http://www.dat.gov.il/rpic" target="_blank">Ministry of Religious Services</a></p>
<p><em>Enjoy the photos and see it for yourself. (Click for maximum enjoyment.)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thinks that Hamas and ISIS are the same thing. After ISIS beheaded Jim Foley and Hamas beheaded some &#8220;collaborators,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/503262857425719296" target="_blank">Bibi tweeted a photo</a> that showed both groups performing executions. This replaced a tweet with a photo of Foley just before he was decapitated with a photo of an execution by Hamas in 2012 that also said Hamas is ISIS, ISIS is Hamas. <a href="https://twitter.com/IsraeliPM/status/503542317718843393" target="_blank">It&#8217;s become like a mantra for Bibi</a> and many supporters of Israel.</p>
<p>The problem is that it&#8217;s just not true.<span id="more-8749"></span></p>
<p>There are certainly reasons to compare the two groups. But there are too many fundamental differences that separate ISIS from Hamas that the comparison between the two is meaningless.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/26/clearly-hamas-is-not-isis/istock-apple-and-orange/" rel="attachment wp-att-8755"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/iStock-apple-and-orange.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="iStock-apple-and-orange" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8755" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> It&#8217;s comparing apples to oranges.</p>
<p>For starters, ISIS literally wants to kill Hamas. In their eyes, Hamas are worse than Israel. ISIS seeks to eliminate &#8220;hypocrites&#8221; &#8211; Muslims who are not sufficiently fundamentalist &#8211; before moving on to non-Muslims. It&#8217;s hard to say mortal enemies are one and the same.</p>
<p>But there is a much more fundamental difference between Hamas and ISIS. Hamas is a terrorist organization that also serves the needs of many people in Gaza. The people of Gaza are directly affected by the actions of Hamas and Hamas acts on their behalf. But not all the people of Gaza are Hamas and not all the people of Gaza approve of Hamas. In any battle against Hamas, Gaza citizens are harmed. It is inevitable. Homes are destroyed, families are broken, children are killed. The blame for these deaths can be attributed, at least in part, to Hamas. But blame is irrelevant. Hamas is a functioning government for hundreds of thousands of people. Almost all of whom are innocent bystanders.</p>
<p>Further, the people of Hamas are all from Gaza. They are fighting a war against their enemy on their border. In their eyes, Israel stole their land. In their eyes, they are fighting back. It&#8217;s a struggle on behalf of their families and neighbors. It&#8217;s their struggle for their own home and their own future. They are local people from Gaza fighting for Gaza. There are women, children, and families that are connected to Hamas militants.</p>
<p>ISIS is more than a terrorist organization. Al Qaeda is a terrorist organization. ISIS is an offshoot of Al Qaeda that doesn&#8217;t simply want to harm the West. ISIS is the state version of Al Qaeda and their intentions are clear. ISIS is now a country that rules according to their super fundamentalist version of Islamic Law. They took these areas by force and enforce their laws by the sword. The citizens of ISIS don&#8217;t really have a choice about whether they want to support ISIS, but more importantly, the IS fighters are not representative of the citizens of these areas. They imposed themselves on the new citizens of ISIS.</p>
<p>IS fighters come from all over the world. The hoodlum who beheaded Jim Foley is apparently from Britain. An American fighting for ISIS was killed today. The spiritual leader of ISIS came from Belgium. The fighters of ISIS are a ragtag group of degenerates who are fighting for glory and adventure. They have no families. Many brought their sons with them to ISIS so that they could be indoctrinated and trained to be fighters as well. But the war and the cause are the only thing that matters. There are no women and small children. In the entire <a href="http://vice.com/video/the-islamic-state-part-1" target="_blank">Vice News ISIS</a> documentary there was literally only one, very brief, shot of a woman in a burqa standing in the background of the frame. IS fighters are not fighting for their families. They are not fighting back against an aggressor. They are a club of men who are wreaking havoc on the region, and they are having a good ol&#8217; time doing it.</p>
<p>So when Bibi says that &#8220;Hamas is ISIS&#8221; and ignores the crucial difference between the two, he is attempting to justify the collateral damage in Gaza by equating the two in a way that is completely unfair. Hamas might behead collaborators with their enemies. Hamas might indiscriminately fire rockets at civilians. These are terrible things to do. No question. But when returning fire on Hamas, there is collateral damage to people under the rule of Hamas. The battlefield is in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The war against ISIS happens on the battlefield. ISIS is trying to capture cities and remove borders. Fighting ISIS in those places won&#8217;t lead to collateral damage at all. There are no families in the trenches with ISIS. But there are families in the trenches in Gaza.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Hamas claims to be interested in making an agreement with Israel. Sometimes they say they will fight Israel to the death, and other times they make agreements with Israel. They are far less ideological in their diplomacy. ISIS won&#8217;t compromise with anyone. They will kill anyone who does not submit to their rule. Hamas kills collaborators, not everyone that is not Hamas. Hamas does not desire to rule the entire earth. They just want Israel. Saying Hamas is ISIS actually betrays a deep misunderstanding of what the IS is all about.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry if this sounds like small difference. But small differences can have really massive consequences. The greatest of these consequences was today&#8217;s news.</p>
<p>A truce was signed today. Hamas agreed to a truce. Is ISIS signing any truces? Clearly, Hamas is not ISIS.</p>
<p><strong>In light of today&#8217;s news, I urge the Israeli Prime Minister to tweet a photo of Hamas shaking on the truce with a caption that says &#8220;Hamas is not ISIS.&#8221;</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I heard about <a href="http://www.seedsofpeace.org" target="_blank">Seeds of Peace</a> a few months ago. Dan Adler was at our home for Shabbat lunch and he asked me if I would be interested in going to visit the camp for a couple of days in the summer. Thrilled at the prospect, I said that whatever, whenever, I would figure out a way to be there.</p>
<p>For weeks, I had been looking forward to observing Seeds of Peace in action and I had high expectations for the experience. I spent a few hours on Monday and Tuesday this week at Seeds of Peace and my expectations were greatly exceeded.<span id="more-8709"></span></p>
<p>Seeds of Peace is an international program that brings teens from the Middle East together for a summer camp experience.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/14/my-small-piece-of-seeds-of-peace/img_8967/" rel="attachment wp-att-8712"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8712" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_8967.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="IMG_8967" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Admission to the program is highly competitive and all the campers are high achievers. Campers self-identify as Israeli (Jewish and Arab), Palestinian, Egyptian, Jordanian, Afghani, Pakistani, and Indian. Back home, many of these teens live in war zones and many are technically at war with each other. A sprinkling of American teens dot the camp roster. The Americans come to learn about conflict and conflict resolution first hand. Every one of the American campers that I met was impressive. These teens are the cream of the crop.</p>
<p>Ideally, the camp seeks to groom a generation of leaders who will be comfortable articulating the position of their opponents, maintain friendships across enemy lines, and are able to engage in meaningful and respectful dialogue with peers from the other side. For many of the campers, this tantalizing goal is met. But at worst, all the campers learn to be positive influences on their peers, cooperation and discussion skills, a great summer experience, and friends for life from around the world.</p>
<p>The very first Seeds of Peace group sat on the lawn of the White House as President Clinton acknowledged their presence as the most important people in attendance at the signing of the historic (and unfulfilled) Oslo Accords. President Clinton was correct. They were the most important people on the White House lawn that day. Friends with mutual understanding and respect, learned at Seeds of Peace, could be the Rabin and Arafat of their generation. That’s the dream.</p>
<p>The reality is that the dream is alive. It could happen. The program is incredible and I can definitely see how campers with the skills and experiences acquired at Seeds of Peace could grow up to be part of the solution. Campers go through intense dialogue sessions where they are encouraged to voice their feelings, as harsh as they may sound, and others are given the opportunity to respond. These meetings are moderated by highly trained professionals and according to the campers, the results are extremely eye-opening. But Seeds of Peace is not kumbaya and peace pipes. The wounds are ripped open, the pain is excruciating, and there are moments of passionate disagreement. That&#8217;s okay. Peace is not the absence of disagreement or pain. Seeds of Peace is real.</p>
<p>The campus is dotted with art and poetry. It’s all inspirational and it’s all made by the campers. These friendly reminders create a beautiful backdrop for the important work happening all over the campus.</p>

<p>Seeds of Peace is blessed with a superb staff from top to bottom. Every person I met who worked for Seeds of Peace impressed me. They are all confident, kind, smart, compassionate, and strong. They were all really good people.</p>
<p>My first Seeds of Peace experience was in the music room. Campers are divided in three kinds of groups. Sleeping bunks, dialogue groups, and dining groups. This way they get to interact with a variety of campers regularly. A lot of wisdom goes into these groups and the staff works hard to maximize the experience for all campers. In the music room, the group was using ukeleles and drums to work together and make some simple music. I met campers who said they were from Israel, Palestine, India, Afghanistan, America, and England before the session began and that wasn’t even the whole group. As a casual observer, I was impressed with the efforts of the staff in fostering a positive experience for everyone and using the music room as a place to develop much broader skills. The campers learned a few chords on the ukelele, but they also learned cooperation, respecting the choices and tastes of others, leadership techniques, and communication skills.</p>

<p>One of the purposes of our visit was to bring John-Michael Parker from the band Great Caesar to the camp so he could perform a bit for the campers. At a lineup before dinner, John-Michael say a gorgeous rendition of Hallelujah. With a little help from Jakob Adler (Dan’s 12 year old son), the campers joined the chorus. They all sang it again and again. It was so powerful to hear all these teens singing a very meaningful song together. It was one of the first things I saw at Seeds of Peace, and I was in tears already.</p>

<p>After dinner I played kickball with a group mostly made up of campers from Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan. I hit it off with a kid from Kabul. He was great in the field and scored a couple of runs. Kickball with a kid from Kabul. It was surreal. This kid grew up in Kabul. He lived through the intense fighting that we all heard about on the news and here he was in Seeds of Peace. Having a ball.</p>
<p>After evening activities, all the campers gathered in a great hall for short talk from the surviving wife of the founder and a video about the founder of Seed of Peace, John Wallach. The video broke me down even further. I told Ms. Wallach that it would have been worth the trip across the county just to see that video with that audience. It was powerful.</p>

<p>After the video, John-Michael performed his hit song “Don’t Ask Me Why“ with a little help from his friends Eli and Jakob (mostly Jakob). The campers loved it and I was moved by their spontaneous swaying and clapping. Our night at Seeds of Peace ended with after the performance but it was far from over for the campers. They would engage in a community building activity to create and foster new friendships and relationships.</p>
<p>My mind was racing as we drove back to our hotel. There was so much more to experience at Seeds of Peace. I had a taste and now I wanted more.</p>
<p>We returned to Seeds of Peace the next day for another dose of Seeds of Peace. This time, we joined campers at lunch. I was seated at a table with 6 campers and a few staff members. I finally had the opportunity to actually talk with the campers about camp and their lives back at home.<br />
<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/14/my-small-piece-of-seeds-of-peace/img_9018a/" rel="attachment wp-att-8710"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8710" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_9018a.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="IMG_9018a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
Some campers come to Seeds of Peace because they’ve seen how much it changed their friends. Before the summer of 2013, there was a teen from Mumbai who was not very friendly and a bit of a bully. He went on Seeds of Peace and came back a sensitive and kind young man. One of his friends noticed the chance and he decided to apply for Seeds of Peace. If it could change his friend, it could certainly help him too.</p>
<p>One camper simply said he wanted to learn about people on the other side of their conflict. An Afghani camper told me how mad he was at a Pakistani camper in his group on a day that Pakistani fighters crossed into Afghanistan and killed two people over the border. He voiced his feelings in dialogue group and directed them at his Pakistani peer. They worked through it. It was tough. But it worked. It’s not magic or anything. It’s real work by the campers that does it.</p>
<p>Others told me that they came to Seeds of Peace to change the world. They want to begin with their families and their communities and hopefully move on to the entire world. These are the optimistic, ambitious campers. One Israeli teen was waxing poetic about the role of Jewish people in the world and how he came to make world peace. Sounds too easy. Especially at Seeds of Peace, where difficult conversations are moderated and guided.</p>
<p>But it’s not easy. Many of the campers don’t have peacemaking intentions. Some of the campers come just to tell their side of the story. One Palestinian girl was so hopeless about the prospects for peace in her world that she just wanted to tell the Israeli campers how she feels. She’s even trying to resist the natural friendships that are formed through the experience. Her greatest fear is making an Israeli friend and then seeing her friend at a checkpoint in her IDF uniform. It would be too much for her to handle so she is protecting herself by not making friends. I learned a lot about the Palestinian experience from her, more than I am at liberty. I think everyone who loves Israel should talk to people from the West Bank or Gaza and just listen.</p>
<p>My favorite quip of the discussion was when a 15 year old from Pakistan told me that he is going to teach his parents and grandparents not to hate Indians and Afghanis. When I challenged him by asking why they should listen to a 15 year old kid, he was emphatic that he believes that &#8220;age does not matter.&#8221; He was undeterred. So I taught him about the <em>ad hominem</em> fallacy because he’s going to need to pull that card out of his pocket at some point. He was appreciative.</p>
<p>Another thing I learned from talking to the campers is that not all of them actually know about the conflicts in their countries. They know that there is a conflict and they may even know the major players in the conflict. But these are just teenagers. They don’t know all the history and even what they do know lacks a sophisticated understanding of the issues. Seeds of Peace helps them develop the vocabulary and terminology to discuss the problems in their countries. More importantly, it provides a framework for understanding the conflicts through the eyes of their opponents. But above all, it gives campers the opportunity to learn the history and current state of their conflicts.</p>
<p>Talking to the campers was a special treat. I learned a lot. Hopefully the campers thought I had something to offer them as well. I felt very comfortable talking to the campers and I credit them for being so warm and welcoming. I only wish I had more time with them.</p>
<p>As I walked towards the parking lot with Dan, Eli, and Jakob, I felt a sweet sorrow. I didn’t want to leave. I wanted to stay at Seeds of Peace. The camp puts everything I believe about conflict and peace into action. It is planting seeds of peace, not harvesting peace. The seeds may take a long time to germinate and sprout. Not all the seeds will be successes. But something has been planted. It was planted in me just being there for a couple of days. It gets planted in hundreds of teens from around the world year after year. Those seeds are bearing fruit. One man’s dream is coming true.</p>
<p>I have dreams of returning to Seeds of Peace. It would be an honor to spend time at Seeds of Peace next summer, or every summer. Hopefully, I’ll make my way back there. In the meantime, I know there is something incredible happening under the watchful eye of some amazing people at Seeds of Peace. Keep on planting. Peace is coming. There is peace on a small idyllic campus in Maine. The rest of us will get there soon.</p>
<p>Thank you Dan Adler for showing me this beautiful place. Thank you John Wallach for making this beautiful place. Thank you to the staff of Seeds of Peace for a beautiful experience. Thank you Seeds of Peace for being this beautiful place.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peace has descended upon southern Israel. The war is over. Finally. Hopefully. No more rockets flying overhead. No more air strikes on Hamas targets. No more artillery battles in urban Gaza neighborhoods. Hopefully, the underground tunnel terror network is impotent by now.</p>
<p>We can all breathe a collective sigh of relief.</p>
<p>The worst time for the public to analyze the cost and benefit of a war is during a war. Emotions are high. Armchair analysts have almost no way of influencing war policy and the analysis is undoubtedly missing key data and driven purely by ideology. But now that it’s over, I think it’s time to ask <em>the</em> question. There is only one question to ask now.</p>
<p><em>Was it worth it?</em></p>
<p><span id="more-8676"></span></p>
<p>The only way to answer this question is to establish the status before the war, then establish the status after the war, and then establish the cost of getting from the former to the latter.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/07/was-the-war-in-gaza-worthwhile/israel-palestinian-gaza-conflict/" rel="attachment wp-att-8678"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8678" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/532217197.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="ISRAEL-PALESTINIAN-GAZA-CONFLICT" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Two months ago, there was relative quiet in the region. A kidnapping and murder in June changed everything. Israel responded, Hamas escalated, and suddenly we were at war. Hundreds of people were killed. Lives have been changed forever. War comes at a great cost. For people like me, who want to avoid that cost unless absolutely necessary, the war became a great internal moral struggle.</p>
<p>All I could think about, was <em>how many Israeli lives were lost in the war? How many innocent Palestinians were lost? </em><em>Are those numbers higher or lower than the number of lives that would have been lost if there had been no war?</em></p>
<p>To me, that is the only thing matters.</p>
<p>It bothered me enough to do some research. From 2005-2007, four Israeli citizens were killed by Hamas terror attacks. During Operation Cast Lead in 2008, Hamas rockets killed three Israeli citizens. In 2011, Hamas militants murdered six Israeli civilians and another was killed following Israel’s immediate response. The subsequent Operation Returning Echo saw zero Israeli civilian casualties. Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012 saw the death of four more Israeli citizens. Three yeshiva students were kidnapped and murdered in June 2014 and three more Israelis were killed during the war.</p>
<p>In all, Hamas or their affiliates have killed 23 innocent Israeli civilians in the last decade. This is an unacceptable number. The only acceptable number is zero.</p>
<p>Israel championed the terror victims admirably. Vowing to neuter Hamas, the IDF has operated in Gaza several times over the last decade. During these incursions, dozens of Israeli soldiers have died. Several thousand Palestinians, innocent and guilty, have been killed.</p>
<p>We return to our initial question. Have we reduced the total number of deaths with these efforts? Or have we increased the total number of deaths? Or is it too uncertain?</p>
<p>Again, I ask this question, because it’s the only question that matters. War is a last resort for Israel and it can only justify war if the fighting will reduce death. Israel calls its army a Defense Force for a reason.</p>
<p>Prior to the discovery of the tunnel terror network, I privately feared that the war was actually causing more death than it was sparing. The status quo didn’t seem so terrible. But the war was taking the lives of far too many soldiers and Palestinian civilians. Their blood is just as red as the rest of us. I didn’t think it was fair for soldiers and innocents in Gaza to die unless their death was part of a cause that was saving the lives of others. Every time a soldier was pronounced dead, I flinched in pain. Every time I heard of the civilian casualties in Gaza, I shuddered.  It didn’t make sense to me.</p>
<p>Then we found the tunnels. The tunnels justify everything. A well-organized terror operation would have killed thousands of innocent Israelis. It’s impossible to think that the extensive tunnel network was simply an elaborate underground system for smuggling goods into Gaza. It was almost certainly part of a plan to kill Israelis. Finding and destroying those tunnels cost us many lives. But it seems very likely that it saved far more lives.</p>
<p>War is terrible. I am extremely uncomfortable with war. The only way for me to reconcile war in my mind is to see the benefits of war outweighing the cost. For much of this conflict I wasn’t sure if the benefits outweighed the cost. Now I am sure.</p>
<p>Rest easy, my fellow doves. The war is over. And it was worth it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Young men and women are fighting for their lives and the safety of their families and their nation at this very moment. The IDF is in Gaza and we all hope and pray for their swift and safe return.</p>
<p>No matter one’s personal preference or opinion on Operation Protective Edge, too soft, too harsh, too quick, too slow, too whatever, those are our sons and daughters in harm’s way and we are united in our support of their sacrifice.</p>
<p>A verse in this week’s Torah portion so purely expresses the emotions of many Diaspora Jews with an eye on Israel.<span id="more-8637"></span> First noted by Rabbi Efrem Goldberg of the Boca Raton Synagogue, when I saw this verse isolated from its context, and standing on its own, the words resonated strongly with me. The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Menashe preferred to stay on the east bank of the Jordan rather than cross the Jordan and enter the land of Canaan. Moses chastised them. Their brothers will be fighting wars of conquest in Canaan! &#8220;האחיכם יבואו למלחמה ואתם תשבו פה” &#8211; “will your brothers enter into battle and you will remain here?!”<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/07/18/you-can-help-the-idf/soldats-tsahal/" rel="attachment wp-att-8641"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8641" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/soldats-tsahal.jpg?w=980" alt="soldats-tsahal" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>That’s how it feels. Our brothers and sisters have entered into battle, and we are marooned in our homes and communities living vicariously through their courageous efforts. Appreciating the verse doesn’t mean that we can do anything about it. It doesn’t mean that I actually wish I could jump on a plane and put on an IDF uniform. It is, however, a lovely metaphor that describes the feelings of helplessness and guilt-ridden comfort I feel so many miles away.</p>
<p>Wallowing in my desperation, I remember an email I received this afternoon from my uncle Rabbi Pesach Lerner. I was working when the email infiltrated my inbox and only gave it half a glance. But now, in my anxiety filled reverie I realized it was time to take a second look.</p>
<p>The email described a program initiated by Rav Simcha Kook, Chief Rabbi of Rehovot, called “<a href="http://theshmiraproject.com">The Shmira Project</a>.” Active duty soldiers and registered civilians are randomly paired. The soldier is given the name of the civilian and vice versa. When the soldier is on the battlefield, the soldier will think of the soldier’s pair and fight on their behalf. When the civilian is living their civilian life, the civilian will do good deeds on behalf of the soldier. All the while, both are aware of their counterparts and their partner’s efforts on their behalf. It’s simple and simply beautiful.</p>
<p>There are those who subscribe to the religious belief that the merits of the good deeds will protect the soldiers. Accordingly, the shmira, protection, is spiritual and very real. Others attribute the protection to the soldier knowing that there is someone thinking about the soldier and hoping for the soldier’s success. It can be very powerful to know that one is not alone. The Shmira Project tells every matched soldier that there is a specific person out there, somewhere, who is doing good deeds on their behalf. Conversely, the civilian knows that there is a soldier who is benefitting from their partnership and this can connect the civilian to the battlefield in a magnificent way.</p>
<p>I decided to sign up. I navigated to their website, read the literature, and was ready to go. It was very easy to register and I entered all the necessary information. When I clicked to submit my name and information, the website gave me a name of my partner soldier. I read his name. <em>Achira ben Nira</em>. Then it happened. I started to cry. This was completely unexpected. But seeing that name in black and white made me feel so much closer to the battlefield. I am certain that when he sees my name, he will feel a sense of unity and belonging to the Jewish people because some person on the other side of the world is thinking about him and doing good deeds on his behalf.</p>
<p>People want to know what they can do to help the IDF. We want to participate. We want to contribute to the cause. There are practical suggestions like sending care packages and food items, or sending games and writing letters. I support all these ideas and more. The soldiers need basic supplies and we can provide many of those items.</p>
<p>I think there is also value in seemingly non-practical suggestions. There is something special about expressing solidarity and offering human connection to people who are living on the edge. Love and appreciation can provide great strength to anyone. Isolated and lonely soldiers need it even more. If you believe in the spiritual protection of good deeds, that’s obviously a superb way to contribute.</p>
<p>I suggest that we all sign up for The Shmira Project. Adopt a soldier. Remember your soldier’s name. Do good deeds on your soldier’s behalf. Connect with that perfect stranger who needs our spiritual and psychological support during life threatening combat. Be part of this effort. Don’t just sit on the sidelines. I thought being paired would be just a procedural formality. Instead, seeing that name, <em>Achira ben Nira</em>, moved me deeply. I can only hope you will feel something similar to what I felt. But I know in my heart how much it means to A<em>chira ben Nira</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>This article first appeared on <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/the-lighthouse/.premium-1.604499" target="_blank">my Haaretz blog</a>. It appears here with permission.</i></p>
<p>President Obama’s <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-peace-conference/1.603324" target="_blank">editorial in Haaretz</a> elicited predictable partisan responses. Supporters of the president and Israel gleefully shared the article as evidence of the unwavering support the current United States government continues to provide for Israel. Simultaneously, the president’s detractors criticized the timing of the article, its omissions, and dismissed its ‘acceptable content’ as political bluster that was contradicted by observable fact.</p>
<p>There’s no official position or consensus among Orthodox Jews on this issue, but my sense is that Orthodox Jews fall in the detractor camp more often than the supporter camp. Politics are messy, and there are reasonable arguments to be made about Obama’s job performance overall. But I think that supporters of Israel who oppose Obama for domestic reasons, valid or contrived, are allowing those grievances to disproportionately influence their opinion of Obama’s support of Israel.<span id="more-8615"></span></p>
<p>In particular, many critics of Obama pointed to his continued usage of the word “restraint” when referring to Israel’s right to defend itself. “At this dangerous moment, all parties must protect the innocent and act with reasonableness and restraint, not vengeance and retribution.” To his detractors, this is unacceptable. By advocating restraint the president is defanging the Israel Defense Forces which is evidence that Obama is anti-Israel. Meanwhile, how quickly we forget that Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush all used the same language of restraint when Israel has been attacked by its enemies.</p>
<p>It’s no contradiction to assert Israel’s ability to defend itself while also urging restraint. The legal definition of self defense is to protect oneself from harm caused by the attack of another. The amount of force used must be sufficient for protection from the imminent harm but it may not be used as an excuse for the use of excessive force or an affirmative attack. Determining the level of force necessary for protection in Israel is a debatable point. The United States has consistently urged Israel to be careful not to cross the line where defense morphs into aggression. This is not anti-Israel. Israel agrees with this position. The slight disagreements are simply about where to draw that line. But for too many people, politics trumps reason and prudence granting themselves a license to use this innocent turn of phrase as fuel to the anti-Obama fire.</p>
<p>Channelling this rhetoric, an Orthodox Jew on a Fox News Channel show said on Thursday, “This is an anti-Israel administration; it’s the first administration in American history that is obviously anti-Israel; it’s borderline a Jew-hating administration.” The evidence for this inflammatory statement is the flimsy criticism that the United States is now funding Hamas under the new Palestinian Unity Government.</p>
<p>It’s a valid question to ask whether support for the unity government is wise. It’s also a valid question to ask whether support for a unity government with no Hamas militants in official positions is actually funding Hamas. Another valid question is whether the unity government will last more than a few weeks. But the answer to these questions are far from settled.</p>
<p>It’s also a valid question to ask whether the PA can influence Hamas or whether Hamas will inevitably militarize the PA. President Abbas insists that nothing has really changed. He says that he is the boss and the PA will negotiate with Israel while recognizing Israel’s right to exist. Furthermore, Abbas promises that no Hamas militants will take government positions. Hamas officials claim that they will never recognize Israel no matter what Abbas says.</p>
<p>The point is that the issue is complex and unsettled. Yet, to some people this speculation is evidence that Obama is anti-Israel and borderline anti-Jewish.</p>
<p>On the other hand, President Obama personally requested that Congress fund the Iron Dome air defense system in 2010. In the years since 2010, the United States has provided additional funding for Iron Dome. It’s a terribly odd thing for an anti-Israel, borderline Jew hating administration to fund Israel’s most effective tool in protecting its citizens from rocket attacks. Unlike the criticism of the phrase parsers and Oracles, there is no speculation about Iron Dome. It was recommended by Obama and he takes pride in its success. Of course this makes perfect sense as Iron Dome is a classic self defense system and cannot be turned into a weapon or even construed as a form of aggression. An elegant solution that exemplifies restraint.</p>
<p>The congressional vote to fund Iron Dome passed 410-4. There were four members of congress who inexplicably opposed giving their ally in the Middle East an Iron Dome to protect its citizens. None of them are named Barak Obama. They are John Conyers, Dennis Kucinich, Ron Paul, and Pete Stark. If you are looking for anti-Israel villains in the 2010 United States government, those four would be a good place to start.</p>
<p>Jewish tradition places great emphasis on hakarat hatov &#8211; gratitude. Politics comes after religious obligation and ethics. Our sages teach us that God commanded Moses to strike the Nile in order to commence the plague of blood. Moses delegated this duty to his brother Aaron because of his gratitude to the Nile for saving his life when his mother placed him inside a floating cradle in the river. The water saved Moses’ life and so he refused to strike the water. President Obama is saving Jewish lives in Israel. Not just one life. He’s saving many lives. For that, the Jewish response is to say thank you. So on behalf of less appreciative Orthodox Jewish brethren, I say thank you Mr. President. Your support and tangible assistance are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Calling Obama anti-Israel and borderline anti-Jewish is more anti-Jewish than anything Obama has ever done. It is not just striking the Nile that saved us once. It is striking the Nile repeatedly after it saved us innumerable times. A cornerstone of Judaism is gratitude. The people of Israel and Jews all over the world should be thanking President Obama, not slandering the president with rank speculation and dismissive cynicism. Feel free to disagree with a million things Obama has done that you don’t like. When he does something just and moral and good, just say thank you.</p>

<p>We bared our souls and left our emotions on our sleeve throughout the last few weeks. But now it&#8217;s over. There is a void where our worry and concern occupied our hearts. It begs to be filled.</p>
<p>Music can help us heal, or at least help us cope. The tune that has been working for me is one of my favorite Jewish songs, Umacha by The Rabbis&#8217; Sons. It was therapeutic for me to make this little video with some of the poignant images set to Umacha. It helped me a little so I am sharing it with you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The devastating news reverberates throughout the Jewish world. Our worst fears have been confirmed. We won&#8217;t be able to #bringbackourboys. It&#8217;s over. And for now, we mourn.</p>
<p>But many of us are struggling to unravel the Gordian Knot of emotions, religious meaning, spiritual devotion, time, effort, energy we&#8217;ve put into these last few weeks. For those of us who are parents of children who have been aware of the ordeal, many of us are wondering what we tell our children? But all of us are also wondering, what do we tell ourselves?!<span id="more-8591"></span></p>
<p>Perhaps the wisest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard about tragedy was something Fred Rogers quoted from his mother. He said that his mother would comfort him during challenging times with a pithy thought.<strong><em> &#8220;Look for the helpers.&#8221;</em></strong> So simple and so sublime.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/06/30/tell-children/bnlfreoimaadt5v-jpg-large/" rel="attachment wp-att-8592"><img class="alignright wp-image-8592 size-medium" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BnlFreOIMAAdt5V.jpg-large.jpeg?resize=600%2C445" alt="BnlFreOIMAAdt5V.jpg-large" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>For every wicked person in the world wreaking havoc and destroying lives, there are many more good people in the world who are helping others and fixing the things that were broken by the evil people. Our minds focus on the outliers and the ones who make the most noise. But for every person doing the wrong thing, there are more people doing the right thing. We should not allow the pain to dominate us so completely that we forget that there is enough light in the world to outweigh the darkness.</p>
<p>Most of all, we can all be one of the helpers. Say something nice. Do something kind. Find empathy. Spread love.</p>
<p>Children need to be reminded of this even more than adults. If they know that something sad has happened because of bad people, remind your children to look for the helpers.</p>
<p>The emotions of a child are likely to be their primary concern. Most kids aren&#8217;t as worried about theology as adults. Adults have tougher questions and life experiences that demand a response. Here&#8217;s what I say today: <em>(For children who do worry about this kind of thing, I think the following would be just as applicable.)</em></p>
<p>For believers, there is a real struggle between belief and doubt. When we pray, we are hopeful and optimistic, and we want to believe. When we are crushed and depressed, we experience doubt. The human mind seeks to make peace between these two warring factions. We want to be certain about our beliefs and if we aren&#8217;t certain that our beliefs are true, our mind&#8217;s next option is to be certain that our beliefs are false. The last resort, and option that is to avoided at all costs, is the grey area in the middle. That place where our doubt and our yearning for certainty are at loggerheads. We don&#8217;t want to be in that place.</p>
<p>Yet, that is where life happens. The place of contradiction and confusion is where all the action is. We want to reject it so badly and be certain of everything being true on one side or if not, everything is a lie, for sure. But it just isn&#8217;t that way at all and we need to embrace that. We are not going to understand everything. It&#8217;s a limitation of being a physical being with limited resources. We can&#8217;t really be certain of anything which means that the best we can do is to expect a clash of feelings and thoughts.</p>
<p>What do we do with these conflicting ideas rattling in our brain? What do we do when our heart says one thing and our mind says another? What do we do when we want to be mad at God but we also want God to make it all better? Indeed, what do we do?</p>
<p>I think what we do is we learn to live in that struggle. We look at this challenge as an opportunity to make ourselves better, more complete, more complex, more nuanced. In whatever way we can grow or improve, we are using the struggle for good. It&#8217;s not that we ignore the questions, God forbid. No. We articulate our questions, we get mad, we feel the pain, and then we dive right into those emotions and swim to the other side. In the other side we articulate our faith, in God and in people and in ourselves, we find reasons for hope and excuses to love, and then we dive right back into the battle zone and struggle with our feelings.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy. It doesn&#8217;t simplify things. But while there is an elegance to simplicity, the most beautiful things are truly the most complex and intricate. These struggles enable us to weave a delicate tapestry that expresses our most basic human emotions. It won&#8217;t magically make us feel happy again. But in my view, we don&#8217;t try to feel better as much as we just try to feel. Feel all the feelings, live on this precipitous cliff, embrace the struggle, and when we emerge from the fray we will have found something new in ourselves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, a hyperbolic statement made by a prominent Rosh Yeshiva in March was publicized in the media. The precise nature of the comments are unimportant. The statement seemed to authorize and celebrate the idea that the Israeli government had the status of Amalek and should be killed. This provocative and dangerous statement was widely reported in the media and thrust Rabbi Nissan Kaplan into the spotlight.</p>
<p>Rabbi Kaplan attempted, clumsily at times, to retract the offensive statement and apologize for offending so many people. I sensed that his regret was genuine but most of his critics were skeptical and remained unconvinced. Friends and readers in contact with Rabbi Kaplan told me that he was committed to setting the record straight.</p>
<p>I believe that Rabbi Kaplan&#8217;s remarks in his class last night effectively communicate his true feelings on this issue. In fact, I think that he has gone further than critics of charedi society would ever dream.</p>
<p><span id="more-8406"></span></p>
<p>Rabbi Kaplan correctly says that hyperbole is a common tactic in Yeshiva. The students know it. The rabbis know it. No one takes the hyperbolic statements literally. He&#8217;s right about that. So he explains that he is sure that no one in the room when he made the statement condoning violence against Israeli government officials and soldiers took it literally. That&#8217;s true too. Rabbi Kaplan explained that the meaning of his hyperbolic statement was that the students should wage war with their <em>yetzer hara</em>. The real battle is not against the secular government or non-Orthodox Jews. It&#8217;s the internal battle of wills against oneself. <em>&#8220;Chas v&#8217;Shalom for a person to think he is allowed to or that he has to&#8230; if a person goes and hits&#8230; the one who is disturbing you is the Yetzer Hara&#8230; fight the Yetzer Hara. The guys who were taught mesiras nefesh is physically, they never became anything.&#8221;<a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/610xwa5.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8407" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/610xwa5.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></em></p>
<p>But not only did Rabbi Kaplan reiterate that his statement was not meant to be taken literally, he pushed back in the opposite direction. In a fairly remarkable section of the lecture, Rabbi Kaplan demands that his students express <em>hakaras hatov </em>(gratitude) to the Israeli government and the Israel Defense Forces. In strong language, Rabbi Kaplan impresses upon his audience that the philosophy of their society is that the people who keep Israel safe and secure, from Knesset Members and police men, to soldiers and special forces, are doing their work so that the yeshiva student may have the opportunity to do what they believe is most important, study Torah. He even jokes that if Israel was run by yeshiva students the country, no one would want to live in Israel. Rabbi Kaplan explained that even if the yeshiva and the government have their theological differences, they are owed a huge debt of gratitude for enabling their Torah study.</p>
<p>The lecture ends with a surprise dismantling of another charedi stereotype. Rabbi Kaplan talked about advising young men to leave the study hall and enter the workforce. He reported that he heard from 10 of his students in the last week. Of the ten, he had advised six to go to work and the other four were advised to study because they had potential to be great scholars and teachers. After some time, the four who were still in yeshiva followed up with Rabbi Kaplan because they were were struggling financially. Rabbi Kaplan advised one of the four to get a job. The other three were advised to return to their studies. Within a short while, the remaining three were hired as rabbis teaching in other yeshivas. I am not surprised by this anecdote, but it does present a more nuanced version of the charedi community than the stereotypes would lead outsiders to believe.</p>
<p>The lecture is 30 minutes long. The relevant portion begins at around minute 12. Yeshiva veterans will be able to decipher the yinglish and yeshivish cadence with relative ease. If you&#8217;re not familiar with yeshiva style preaching, you might feel a little lost. Everything I have written in this post is actually stated in the lecture.</p>
<p>Of course Rabbi Kaplan feels that he has to balance the requirement for hakaras hatov with reiterations of the primacy of Torah study and the universal benefits to Torah study that are part of his worldview. These might sound extreme to newcomers and could distract from his overall message. Yet, I assure you that this is the second most favorable version of this worldview I have ever heard from a bona fide contemporary charedi rabbi. We would be very fortunate if this was universally held and preached in all charedi yeshivas. For now, I am grateful that an influential and prominent Rosh Yeshiva has made taken this position on the record.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People asked me what some of the criteria were for the rabbis who were asked to join the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/05/12/groundbreaking-meeting/">Groundbreaking Meeting</a> on Sunday. While many factors and relationships were factored, there was one overriding consideration. It was the ability to be self critical.</p>
<p>Self criticism is not easy. It&#8217;s not easy for individuals. It&#8217;s not easy for leaders or spokespeople of a movement or a group. It&#8217;s especially difficult for people who part of a group that markets itself as perfect or potentially perfect. It&#8217;s even harder when those people are actually accustomed to being advocates for the movement. Their brains are trained to minimize problems and maximize success. It can be a great challenge to switch from advocate to critic, even for a short while.<span id="more-8401"></span></p>
<p>When I talked to the participants of this meeting, I asked them if they would be comfortable with self criticism. To varying degrees, they all were. Self criticism was at the core our meeting and both groups came to the table prepared to question the established norms of Orthodox Judaism. To me, this is what made the meeting unique. Sometimes one group might go to another more powerful group with criticism, but usually the more powerful group is on the receiving end of the criticism and is serving the advocate role in defending against the criticism. Here, both groups came to the table as peers, as equals. This made all the difference in the world in our discussion.<a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image116.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8402" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/image116.jpg?w=980" alt="image116" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It is my opinion, that the absence of self criticism is one of the most harmful aspects of any society and is particularly harmful in a religious community. So much of our focus as a community is on projecting an image of excellence and success, that we don&#8217;t engage in public self criticism.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard people say that it&#8217;s better not to engage in self criticism in public because it gives fuel to our detractors and external critics. Some argue that self criticism can influence people to leave our community. I think this is incorrect. The thing that I have heard from people who leave or are on the fringe is that self criticism is a reason to stay, not to leave. It&#8217;s not the thing that is being criticized, as much as it is whether we are comfortable with that criticism.</p>
<p>Others have said that we need to concerned about how we appear to the outsiders. This is particularly true about when we talk about Israel. The public image of Israel is a great concern to many people. The cost of self criticism about Israel is that the image of Israel may be tainted by the criticism. To avoid contaminating Israel&#8217;s reputation some people argue that we should not make any public criticism of Israel. But to me , the greatest sign of strength is self criticism. To me, it&#8217;s far worse to be concerned with our image that with our mistakes. This is especially true in the eyes of outsiders. Isn&#8217;t it worse to be whitewashing sins than to be self critical? I think so.</p>
<p>Reputation and public opinion cannot be crafted with carefully executed marketing plans. When something has flaws, the blemishes will be noticed. It&#8217;s our choice if those flaws will be noticed despite our best efforts to hide them or if they will be noticed because of our self criticism. If we try to hide them, we face two serious risks. One is that the insiders who notice the flaw lose faith in their leadership because no one is acknowledging the problem. The second, is that outsiders will think we are disingenuously hiding concealing our problems to make ourselves artificially look better. Both of these consequences can be avoided.</p>
<p>But most of all, self criticism is the only real way to change things. We don&#8217;t like when outsiders tell us what we need to do differently. We don&#8217;t like when our way of life is scrutinized by others. But if we do the criticism for ourselves, they won&#8217;t need to disparage. More importantly, we can turn our attention to fixing problems instead of spinning our wheels to make sure no one can see our difficulties. That&#8217;s when real change can happen.</p>
<p>If I have to choose between acknowledging our problems or concealing our problems so that insiders retain their faith in our perfection or so that outsiders don&#8217;t see our imperfections and the strength of self criticism, the choice is simple. It worked magically at our meeting and I have seen its power in conversations with dozens of questioning people over the last few years. Let&#8217;s not be afraid to put our critic&#8217;s glasses on and share what we see. Let&#8217;s put ourselves under the looking glass instead of others. It&#8217;s in our best interest to identify our issues. We look better we are honest, and we have a chance at fixing things if we acknowledge our challenges.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2014/02/breaking-students-prohibition.html" target="_blank">Ramaz won&#8217;t invite a particular professor</a> from Columbia University to speak on its grounds. Rashid Khalidi is a well known supporter of Palestinians and a former advisor to the PLO. His positions on Israel are diametrically opposed to the positions of Ramaz and more Orthodox Jews. Thus, it is reasonable that they do not give him the opportunity to speak on their campus. In general, Ramaz tries to provide the other side of the issues in Israel. It was deemed that Khalidi took this too far.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10102163043659995" target="_blank">On Facebook</a> I argued that he should be allowed to speak and Ramaz should provide a rebuttal to his position immediately. Teens are sophisticated enough to weigh arguments. They do it in Talmud study all the time. We are certain that our arguments will prevail, so let&#8217;s play it out and show our position is correct.</p>
<p><a href="http://rabbisblog.brsonline.org/judicious-platform/" target="_blank">Rabbi Goldberg from Boca Raton Synagogue</a> (along with several commenters) politely took issue with my position. Rabbi Goldberg&#8217;s basic argument is that there are positions that are too extreme and offensive to give a platform. He says that allowing Khalidi to speak is a pluralism that is too liberal invoking the famous &#8220;so open minded their brains fall out&#8221; expression to describe my thinking on this matter.<span id="more-8145"></span></p>
<p>I appreciate Rabbi Goldberg&#8217;s thoughts on this matter because he does invite speakers from a wide range of political positions to his shul. I think that is amazing. But I think my angle on this is a little bit different. Interestingly enough, I saw something written 60 years ago that is illuminating on this subject and reflects my views as well. I think that his words are a fair response to those who took issue with my position.<a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/khalidi-rashid1.jpg"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/khalidi-rashid1.jpg?w=980" alt="khalidi-rashid1" class="alignright size-full wp-image-8146" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>A similar question was raised by Rabbi Lamm in 1954. The Cold War was heating up and Communism was a true threat to humanity. It was a given that Communism was harmful, hateful, vicious, and violent. There was a debate about whether it was appropriate to teach Communism in American public schools.</p>
<p>One school of thought held that teaching Communism would lend legitimacy to an evil empire. It was harmful to teach the ideals of Communism because it would be the first step toward American children becoming atheist KGB sympathizers.</p>
<p>The other school of thought held that all information is potentially harmful and we educate our children how to use it properly. So we teach chemistry even though it could give them the tools to build an atom bomb or cook meth. Our job is to teach responsibility and maturity and morality to ensure that our children make the right choices in life. (Also, the irony of controlling information in a democracy to fight totalitarianism was also raised.)</p>
<p>Rabbi Lamm felt that because this was a moral issue, religious leaders had the right to present their opinions on this issue.</p>
<p>His response was rooted in Chazal. The verse in Shoftim says to the Jewish people that when they reach the land of Israel they are warned &#8220;<em>lo silmad la&#8217;asos k&#8217;toeivos ha&#8217;goyim ha&#8217;hem</em>&#8221; &#8211; do not learn to do as they do in their abominable superstitions and immoral cults. Chazal say that the verse does not simply prohibit learning about the disgusting ways of the nations on Canaan. It does not say we cannot learn their history or scholarship. It says we cannot learn in order to engage in their practices. &#8220;<em>Aval atah lahmed l&#8217;havin ul&#8217;horos</em>&#8221; &#8211; you can learn to understand and to teach. We are not allowed to learn in order to practice in their ways, but we are allowed to learn in order to understand their ways and to judge their ways. After all, how are we to judge their ideas and their ways and their practices if we do not even know what they are? Of course there may be dangers, but there is danger in all knowledge.</p>
<p>Thus, Rabbi Lamm concludes that American public schools should teach Communism. Students should learn all about it and then they should be taught how to criticize Communism and understand why democracy is preferable. It&#8217;s a learning experience that is invaluable and based on the understanding of Chazal.</p>
<p>He rounds out the idea by saying that the Talmud is far more liberal in its publication and education of wrong ideas than we realize. We engage in explicit discussions about all sorts of lurid and immoral behavior while studying Talmud. We are not afraid that the student of the Talmud will take the information about the sins encountered in the Talmud and lead that kind of life. Sure, ignorance is safe, but so is prison and so is death. Life is fraught with risk and our job is not to limit information and knowledge, rather it is to learn as much as we can about our world and cultivate the tools to think critically about ideas that we reject. </p>
<p>Teach Communism. Teach why it&#8217;s wrong. That was Rabbi Lamm&#8217;s approach. This way of thinking resonates with me. I do believe there are limits to this idea, especially in the religious realm, but politically I think it&#8217;s certainly a good approach.</p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s not perfectly analogous to inviting a supporter of the PLO who holds positions that if borne out would inevitably harm our brothers and sisters in Israel and the Diaspora. I prefer not to get into the specific details of what this particular speaker holds and whether he hates Jews. I happen to think his position is dangerous, if it would be carried out. I don&#8217;t think his ideas are going to become any sort of reality. I don&#8217;t even think there is a risk that his ideas will become reality. His words carry no actual effect. And so inviting him to speak for the purpose of rebutting his ideas is not only acceptable to me, I think it might even be preferable.</p>
<p>While I believe that this approach stands on its own, I know that Rabbi Lamm&#8217;s words carry far greater weight than anything I could ever hope to say on any subject. It was a complete accident that I saw his thoughts on teaching Communism last night. I share it with you because I think it&#8217;s relevant. Even if it&#8217;s not exactly on point, it paints a picture that is close enough to my view that I don&#8217;t think my position could be characterized as completely at odds with Rabbi Lamm&#8217;s position. In fact, I think it&#8217;s close enough that his words are instructive here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BBC Newsnight facilitated a bit of a debate between a policy maker at Oxfam and Daniel Birnbaum, CEO of Sodastream. Kudos to the BBC for making it happen. It&#8217;s not easy to bring opposing perspectives into a room to discuss heated issues. The host also did a masterful job at working with both guests to help them articulate their points.</p>
<p>Most people I know think that the Oxfam guy did a terrible job and Birnbaum was superb. I agree. If you haven&#8217;t seen the video yet, check it out here:<span id="more-8095"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cd9ioQrTqoY?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The Oxfam guy was brutal. He assumes too much and he can&#8217;t explain himself well enough to be taken seriously. But Oxfam does have an articulable position. While, I disagree with Oxfam, I think it&#8217;s worth understanding their position, if only to articulate clearer counter arguments. [Straps on lawyer helmet.]<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BBC-Newsnight.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8096" alt="BBC Newsnight" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BBC-Newsnight.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Oxfam is certain that Israeli &#8220;settlements&#8221; in Palestinian territory are the reason that many Palestinians are living in a humanitarian crisis. They believe that any problem Palestinians endure can be attributed to settlements.</p>
<p>Their idea of settlements is not homes or cities. They consider any Israeli anything in the West Bank to be part of the &#8220;settlements&#8221;. So homes, businesses, factories, checkpoints, all of it, are considered settlements in their view. Their tactic for discouraging settlements, is to ban all products (and people) who are living or doing business in settlements.</p>
<p>Therefore, while one person, or one family, or one soldier, or one factory, might be doing some good for the individual people they are helping, it harms the overall condition of the Palestinians because it is a &#8220;settlement&#8221;. And settlements are the problem for the greater group even if they are good for a smaller group within the greater group. So while Sodastream is amazing for what they do, they cannot be supported, and are subject to the ban.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the syllogism. Oxfam holds that Sodastream is located in Palestinian territory. They are an Isreali business therefore they are a settlement. Settlements cause all the problems. Therefore, Sodastream must be stopped for the greater good.</p>
<p>(The poor Oxfam guy on BBC couldn&#8217;t articulate this, so he looked even dumber than he should have.)</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some counterpoints [Straps on other lawyer helmet.]:</p>
<p>Under Oslo, Sodastream is not actually on Palestinian territory (maybe).</p>
<p>There are much bigger reasons that Palestinians are living in poverty.</p>
<p>A factory is not a settlement. It&#8217;s a place of business. It could be argued, perhaps, that building a home or village could be seen as a land grab, seeing as it really only benefits Israel. That might be worthy of protest from Oxfam. But a place of work for Palestinians certainly is NOT a settlement. It&#8217;s an opportunity.</p>
<p>Banning products from the settlements is a poor way to help Palestinians. There are much better ways to assist them.</p>
<p>It could be argued that by giving opportunities to Palestinians to interact in positive ways with Israelis is a far better way of achieving mutual respect and peace than faux outrage and hostility through boycotts.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s just a bit of analysis:</p>
<p>Oxfam&#8217;s fatal flaw is that they are operating with far too much policy and defining words and ideas much too simply. This is typical of big institutions. They can&#8217;t make decisions on an ad hoc basis so they revert to policy and broad strokes. They can&#8217;t analyze the individual problem and issue on its own and so they miss the boat completely. Because of the opportunity for better wages and the opportunity to foster friendship and camaraderie, I think more Sodastreams would probably bring peace and prosperity closer for Palestinians and Israelis. If Oxfam wants to solve the humanitarian crisis, it seems to me that this is a good start. Certainly better than a boycott.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good lesson for us living in a very large and cumbersome Orthodox Judaism. We also have a lot of policies. We also oversimplify ideas and words. We also fail to analyze things on their own merits, instead relying on generalities and stereotypes.</p>
<p>We need to constantly remind ourselves that policies might work for, say 65%, of the community. But everyone else needs more flexibility and case by case analysis. For example, over the last 20 years, the Kollel lifestyle was our policy. That was what people did for 2-10 years after they got married. It&#8217;s become unsustainable. Now the policy is starting to change. But I worry that we are just changing policy. We should be dealing with people as individuals. We should be finding our brightest stars and cultivating leaders. We should not just be saying Kollel is a poor choice for everyone. There are tons of other well intended policies in Orthodox Judaism, this is just one example. Policies are more efficient. But perhaps it&#8217;s time to cut back a bit on the efficiency and focus more on effectiveness.</p>
<p>My grandfather used to say, the only policy he has is that he doesn&#8217;t have any policies. I think that&#8217;s a good policy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The long awaited Sodastream advertisement featuring Scarlett Johansson made its broadcast television debut during the Super Bowl last night. The ad has become a touchstone of the various issues raised by Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory and the BDS (Boycott, divest, sanctions) movement.</p>
<p>Johansson’s appearance drew the ire of Oxfam, an activist group that supports BDS. Sodastream’s headquarters are technically located on Palestinian territory thus they are subject to Oxfam’s blanket BDS policy. After eight years as an ambassador for Oxfam, Johansson stepped down amid the controversy.</p>
<p>There is a lot to unpack in this controversy and the key is always to begin with facts. The facts are that the International community considers the settlements illegal under international law. This is a fact. Israel disputes this classification. Scholarship can be supplied to support both sides.<span id="more-8089"></span></p>
<p>It’s a matter of opinion as to whether the settlements hinder or help peaceful relations between Israelis and Palestinians. One cannot prove that they are harmful nor can one prove that they are helpful.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/30_scarlet_g_w_LRG.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8090" alt="30_scarlet_g_w_LRG" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/30_scarlet_g_w_LRG.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There is more than one kind of BDS too. The scope of the movement ranges from applying it to all Israeli products to only products of the settlements.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting developments in the case of Sodastream is related to the fact that over half of Sodastream’s employees are Palestinian. On argument against the BDS movement is that companies like Sodastream provide well paying jobs to Palestinians. Sodastream in particular, argued that they treat their Palestinian employees quite well, paying them much higher wages than completing jobs in the region with great benefits and break time for Muslim prayer in their onsite Mosque. This is really an irrelevant argument. If your business is illegal, it doesn’t really matter how friendly you are to you employees. But it is nice to see such good treatment of factory workers, no matter the surrounding circumstances.</p>
<p>Various news outlets have talked with Palestinians who work at Sodastream about their workplace conditions. I saw anonymous sources refuting Sodastream’s claims. However, in several other news outlets employees were quoted saying that their workplace environment was excellent. Many of them actually opposed BDS because they prefer their Sodastream jobs over other local jobs. They also felt that working in Israeli companies engendered friendships across ethnic lines which was a positive thing in their view. I agree.</p>
<p>That Johansson, Palestinians, and typically liberal papers like Haaretz can see nuance in the Sodastream discussion speaks to the flaws of a universal BDS policy. Like most things, an across the board policy is not the most effective way to address an issue. There is nuance and different situations require different responses.</p>
<p>But this is the way of the activist. When we have a cause we are blinded by the cause and we can barely see past the direct goals and ideals of our cause. This is a very dangerous place to find ourselves.</p>
<p>In a sermon from 1973 on Parshas Terumah, Rabbi Norman Lamm references an article in a magazine called “The Center” written by theoretical biologist Professor Rosen. I did some Internet research and I could not find the article he referenced anywhere so I will defer to his understanding Rosen’s point:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;…social organisms ought to imitate biological organisms, which are orchestrated, doing many different things at once, with nothing ever getting in the way of anything else. The biological organism is exquisitely balanced. Nothing in biology gets carried to its logical extreme. Thus, it is important to pump blood effectively. But if we are going to carry this to its logical conclusion, we must then remove all resistance to the effective pumping of blood, and that means removing the capillary bed and the tissues, and so forth. We will thus have an effective cardiovascular system &#8211; but we will have killed the entire organism in the process! Biology teaches us the principle of balance, of not carrying things to their logical conclusions; for that is the essence of biology.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Apparently, the theory uses the biological systems as a metaphor for social systems as well. We can have a great social cause, but if we are single minded and take our cause to its logical conclusion we are going to destroy the social fabric of our communities. The plight of Palestinian people is a great cause. Maybe settlements are a problem. But they are not the only problem. Nor are they always a problem. Sometimes they are part of a solution. It would appear that in the case of Sodastream, that would be the case.</p>
<p>I’ve seen activists for all kinds of causes take their causes to the logical extreme. These people are not part of any solutions. These are fringe people who eventually lose all credibility and find themselves on the sidelines as their cause is addressed by society.</p>
<p>This applies equally to causes I generally agree with like advocacy for sex abuse victims and prosecuting abusers or increasing public religious roles for women in Orthodox Judaism and causes I disagree with like BDS or circumcision bans. Every cause will have activists who go too far. Every cause has people who will remove the capillaries and tissue so that the heart can pump as effectively as possible, meanwhile the organism is dying.</p>
<p>Let’s all remember that when we are supporting our favorite causes, we cannot sacrifice the greater good for our one cause. Change in one arena will require adjustments in others. If we push too hard, we will inevitably cause malfunction and disfunction. Those are not the ideal conditions for the healthy change we seek.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the middle of December, an academic organization called the American Studies Association (ASA) issued a statement in which they endorsed a boycott of Israel. The boycott was their response to their assessment of the treatment of Palestinians by Israel. About 800 members voted in favor of the boycott.</p>
<p>There have been several strong reactions to this statement as well as many important matter of context that must be discussed.<span id="more-7981"></span></p>
<p>First, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/education/scholars-group-endorses-an-academic-boycott-of-israel.html" target="_blank">NY Times reports</a> that the ASA is an organization with few members and little influence. A Google search for ASA reveals that the American Studies Association doesn&#8217;t even make the first page of result. A professor friend confirmed that the ASA is not a well regarded association and no one really cares what they say. It&#8217;s a small corner of academia that mostly teaches American history and politics. So when opponents try to paint all academics as Israel&#8217;s enemies based on this boycott, it&#8217;s simply untrue. In fact, the much larger and more influential American Association of University Professors opposes the boycott!</p>
<p><em>(By the way, it&#8217;s interesting that the NY Times chose to use a photo of Israeli Arab students at an Israeli University in Haifa.)<br />
</em></p>
<p>Second, the boycott is not really a boycott. It sounds fancy, but the actual teeth of the boycott are anything but sharp. The boycott calls for American universities to cease cooperation with Israeli universities. It does not boycott the professors or scholars or anything else that Israel does or produces. So when opponents of the ASA make arguments like &#8220;Haha, the ASA is hypocritical because they use Israeli developed technology everyday! Haha!&#8221; It really does not address the actual boycott.<a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/la-ol-israel-academic-boycott-blowback-2013122-001.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7982" alt="la-ol-israel-academic-boycott-blowback-2013122-001" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/la-ol-israel-academic-boycott-blowback-2013122-001.jpeg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Third, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian authority actually opposes the boycott too. His position is that anything that is actually produced outside the 1948 borders should be subject to boycott. But not everything inside Israel.</p>
<p>But the thing I was left wondering after seeing the initial statement and the various responses that were written and spoken in defense of Israel was what data the ASA was using to justify its boycott? They make unequivocal statements about the lack of academic freedom for Palestinians. Are these allegations true? Even if they are true, we wouldn&#8217;t have to agree that the solution is to boycott Israel. But we should be concerned enough to learn what circumstances led the ASA to reach this conclusion. Once we&#8217;ve determined their basis for the boycott we can decide whether they raise legitimate issues or valid complaints. I&#8217;ve not seen anything seeking to address their specific grievances that are the basis for their boycott.</p>
<p>The truth is that the ASA did not enumerate these claims in their initial statement. But a recent op-ed in the LA Times by one signer of the boycott sheds light on their position. I have organized the issues she raises. I don&#8217;t know that any of these claims are true or false or if Israel can be blamed for any of the true claims. She makes two specific claims:</p>
<p>1. On our first day in Bethlehem, my husband and I met a young man who had received a scholarship from George Mason University in Virginia but was not granted an exit visa by the Israeli authorities. Instead of embarking on a promising journey in academia, this young Palestinian had to resign himself to a job selling souvenirs to tourists. We learned that Palestinian students of all ages endure harassment at military checkpoints, frequent school closures, unprovoked arrests, imprisonment and sometimes death at the hands of trigger-happy soldiers.</p>
<p>2. Within Israel proper, schools are segregated and, following the model of the Jim Crow South, the government allocates significantly less funding to Palestinian schools, which are often overcrowded and understaffed. Palestinian university professors in Gaza rarely receive permission to travel abroad for conferences, those in the West Bank also face difficulties, and international faculty have been prevented from visiting Palestinian universities.</p>
<p>Additionally, she says that the boycott is intended to give a voice to those who support Palestinians on college campuses. By standing up to Israel, the hope is that the popular, automatic assumption that Israel is in the right will be challenged. These supporters are often subject to unfair treatment in her view. She cites a few examples.</p>
<p>I found this interesting because I have become so accustomed to hearing that college campuses are so incredibly anti-Israel that supporters of Israel are subject to discrimination. I guess it&#8217;s all a matter of perception.</p>
<p>She also explains that anti-Israel is not anti-Jew or anti-Semitic. This is because the ASA resolution does not target people or ethnicities. Instead it targets institutions that are complicit in human rights violations. By targeting those acting instead of the kind of people who are like those acting, the resolution is not a form of ethnic bigotry.</p>
<p>Finally, she argues that while there are far graver humanitarian issues around the world, the relationship between Israel and the United States justifies singling out Israel. Also, the USA has undermined humanitarian efforts in Israel by vetoing UN resolutions condemning Israel.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so important to understand the claims of those who seek to boycott Israel. They have actual grievances. If their grievances are addressed with competing facts we have a chance of rebutting their claims. Upping the rhetoric and organizing counter boycotts does little to actually discuss the issues. Instead it turns into a war that will be won with the group that has greater public support and resources. That&#8217;s just a modern version of &#8220;might makes right.&#8221; We should be focused on &#8220;right makes right.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the grievances are true, I can understand why some people feel compelled to organize a limited boycott. Even if I wouldn&#8217;t join the boycott myself, I can empathize with their concerns. Wouldn&#8217;t any of us prefer that the two substantive examples she cites be untrue? And if they were true, would we not want to fix the problems? I know I would.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any first hand data to rebut the claims made in this op-ed. I am sure there are those who can confirm if these policies are real, or explain why these policies exist if they are true, or who is to blame for these policies, or maybe agree that some policies should actually be adjusted. But we need to tone down the rhetoric on both sides and begin to solve the problems. That&#8217;s the real solution to BDS and accusations of apartheid in Israel. Showing examples of equality and freedom is not sufficient. Each specific claim should be handled and addressed sufficiently. Let&#8217;s get on the same page and fix the misconceptions or errors, whichever it is, it doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new issue of The New Republic cover story is about us. It is about Haredim, modern Orthodox, and women. These are things we discuss regularly online and at our Shabbos tables, and in our coffee rooms. The story is remarkably accurate and balanced, displaying a very deep understanding of the issues in Israel today. I recommend reading the article immediately.</p>
<p>Imagine a spectrum of religious fundamentalism in the orthodox Jewish community. On one end you have extreme Haredi sects and on the other end you have completely secular Israelis. On most things and for most of time the people in the middle, let&#8217;s call them modern orthodox, skewed their allegiences toward the Haredi side. Orthodoxy is the great uniter. The assumption is that any two orthodox people will have more common interests than an orthodox and a secular Jew. This is how things were.<span id="more-7442"></span></p>
<p>In essence, the article argues that while naturally aligned with their fellow orthodox Jews, women from the modern orthodox community in Israel are finding themselves aligned with secular feminist Jews in Israel. The collective pain that is felt due to the oppressiveness toward women in the extreme and not so extreme Haredi world is taking a toll. Women have been attacked physically, verbally, and psychologically for a long time and it is starting to create a negative reaction.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7443" alt="article_inset_lithwick_2" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/article_inset_lithwick_2.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Several times the article mentions signs that tell women how to dress. We have become accustomed to these signs. But the women in the article argue that the signs give license to thugs who want to make a statement to women. To them, the signs mean much more than &#8220;Please be sensitive to our religious beliefs.&#8221; Part of that is because these standards are entering the public sphere and are no longer just limited to the private insular neighborhoods. But the other part of it is that the signs are somehow justifying the negativity and violence toward women.</p>
<p>What has happened is that women who feel hurt and abused are turning to secular and Reform Jews for salvation. Feminism is a dirty word in many orthodox communities, even in some places within the modern orthodox community. But it&#8217;s becoming a necessary evil for modern orthodox women who are not feminists at all to ask for help from feminists. It&#8217;s odd when orthodox people are funding they have more in common with secular and very liberal Jews than fellow orthodox Jews. But that is what is happening.</p>
<p>The article also talks about modern orthodox women who sympathize with the Women of the Wall. I wish they would be more vocal but i was heartened to hear it.</p>
<p>Last week I wrote about finding common ground and room for dialogue between modern orthodox and yeshivish Jews in America. (See:<br />
<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/08/02/maybe-rabbi-birnbaum-has-a-point-a-solution/">Maybe Rabbi Birnbaum Has a Point: A Solution</a>) I think what we are seeing in the article in TNR is what will happen if we can&#8217;t work together. If the people in the middle start to feel like the liberal and secular Jews are more sympathetic to their way of life, the great split that has been predicted for years, will finally happen. Modern orthodox Judaism will become an independent group.</p>
<p>Some might say, what&#8217;s so bad about that? Well there are plenty negative consequences to mention. But I will mention the two biggest issues. First, the Haredi institutions will fall without modern orthodox support. Some might say that&#8217;s not so bad either. I disagree. Their services are necessary, as is their trap door into engagement with society. On the other side, without a connection the Haredi community, the modern orthodox community will be hard pressed to support its own institutions for lack of qualified teachers and rabbis.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not in our best interests to see a formal split. It might happen in Israel and it might happen in America. I think we should do everything we can to prevent it. The first thing we need to do, is get together and talk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7062" alt="174928094" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094.jpg?resize=300%2C173" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is ruffling the feathers of many charedi Gedolim in Israel and America. It seems there are two levels to the rhetoric against MK Lipman.</p>
<p>Primarily, I think many have a problem with him by dint of his association with MK Yair Lapid. It is an article of faith that Lapid is anti-charedi and since MK Lipman is a member of MK Lapid&#8217;s party he is guilty by association. I don&#8217;t think it would be possible to support Yesh Atid and have charedi approval.</p>
<p>Secondarily, many have a problem with MK Lipman&#8217;s positions. I think that his positions are perceived as anti-charedi and therefore anti-Torah. In particular, supporting a requirement that save for specific instances, all charedim participate in the army or national service and join the workforce instead of a blanket exemption for all charedim from service. MK Lipman also supports requiring a basic secular education for all Israelis, no exceptions. By the way, he also supports a better Jewish education for all Israelis, no exceptions.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care to discuss whether charedim are truly the most authentic orthodox Jews or whether they are corrupting Judaism. That&#8217;s a discussion for another time. I want to discuss the reaction of American charedim to MK Lipman&#8217;s proposals.<span id="more-7060"></span></p>
<p>In Israel, a charedi is identified by several social and religious markers. I list them here in no particular order, nor is this list exhaustive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Manner of dress. Charedim wear black and white, sport felt or fur hats, and shun modern style of dress like jeans or T-shirts.</li>
<li>Fear of God. Charedim place God and religion above all else. The word of God is supreme.</li>
<li>Daas Torah. Charedim extend their fealty to the word of God beyond the words of the Written Torah, and even beyond the Oral Law, to include the words of the great rabbis and treat their words like the word of God.</li>
<li>Torah learning is the ultimate service of God. Working for a living is not ideal at best and is actively avoided at worst.</li>
<li>No secular education. Charedim send their children to private schools which do not teach anything that is not found in the Torah.</li>
<li>Rejection of Zionism. The State of Israel is not recognized as a positive development for the Jewish people. It is more likely described as a problem than a solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is your Israeli Charedi checklist.</p>
<p>However in America, people who consider themselves charedi use a different set of parameters.</p>
<p>I think that American charedim subscribe to 1-3, but not necessarily 4-6. The only people in America who truly hold of 4-6 would be chasidim and not all chasidim would agree with 4-6 either. Certainly, many chasidim do not agree with #4 and in America even the chasidic communities are required to give a basic (not sufficient) secular education.</p>
<p>Why does all of this matter?</p>
<p>It seems to me, that American charedim are more similar to MK Lipman than they are to Israeli charedim. It is conceivable that MK Lipman could word his platform a little bit differently and still mean the exact same thing. He could say &#8220;I want Israeli charedim to be like American charedim&#8221; and the practical ramifications would be strikingly similar.</p>
<p>I think MK Lipman would be thrilled if Israeli charedim were like Lakewood charedim. They get a secular education, they work (eventually), they even support the State of Israel to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Yet, American gedolim and charedim in America continue to malign MK Lipman and his platform. I don&#8217;t get it. All he is saying is that Israeli charedim should be more like American charedim! He wants them to be like us! They should be flattered. Not insulted!</p>
<p>R&#8217; Ahron Feldman is a Rosh Yeshiva of a yeshiva that is precisely what MK Lipman wants for Israeli charedim and yet he severely criticizes MK Lipman going so far as to call him a rasha. It doesn&#8217;t add up. If what we have in America is good why is it not good for our brothers and sisters in Israel? And even if what they have could be conceived of as better, it&#8217;s not so terrible to be like the American charedim, is it?</p>
<p>True, the two groups share one name &#8211; Charedim. But they are different types of charedim!</p>
<p>The situation in Israel is complicated. Army service can be difficult for charedim. We can understand the reluctance to become less insular and take time away from Torah study. These are reasonable critiques of the sweeping proposals being discussed right now. But let&#8217;s be reasonable. We can talk about the issues and figure out the best way to deal with them.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge that there are some potential problems with MK Lipman&#8217;s plan. It&#8217;s not easy to just throw away the old system. There are going to be complications. But I think we will be far more successful if we work together. The plan is not to turn charedim into secular Zi0nists. How about just acting more like American charedim? Seems to me that it should be a workable solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6945" alt="130415160947-boston-marathon-explosion-08-horizontal-large-gallery" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/130415160947-boston-marathon-explosion-08-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg?resize=300%2C168" data-recalc-dims="1" />Yesterday, on Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101489314937755" target="_blank">I posted the iconic photo of the 78 year old man</a> in an orange shirt surrounded by police officers with smoke billowing in the background just after the explosion at the Boston Marathon. I took notice of the Israeli flag in the background. It was hard to miss the flag through the smoke and it meant something to me that the flag was so prominent in the photo.</p>
<p>One fellow left a comment on the photo with a link to a CNN version of the photo. In the CNN version the Israeli flag cannot be seen. The implication was that the photo was edited to remove the Israeli flag.</p>
<p>I did a little digging and I discovered that CNN got the photo from Getty Images. I hunted for the photo on Getty Images and found the second photo on their site. At first I was incensed. I even put up a blog post criticizing Getty Images (completely against my nature) for what I thought was scrubbing the photo.</p>
<p>I never looked at the photos side by side. I last saw the original photo last night and I first saw the second photo this morning. They were similar enough that it looked suspicious. But once I posted the photos one above the other I noticed, as did several intrepid readers, that they were <em>not the same photo.</em> The photographer took more than one photo as he got closer to the scene. In one photo the Israeli flag is visible, in the other it is not. But in the second photo, the American flag is visible. That&#8217;s clearly a better choice for this particular tragedy.</p>
<p>Once I realized my mistake I removed the blog post.<span id="more-6951"></span> This despite the fact that I can guarantee that post would have reached 50,000 views within a couple hours. The conspiracy theorists would have loved and shared it to all their fellow conspiracy theorist friends and the realists would have come to see the post and yell at me (and them). But it&#8217;s not about views. It&#8217;s about truth and honest discussion. So I took it down.</p>
<p>Of course, there are people who will try to make this all about Israel and media bias. I almost did too. But if it&#8217;s simply not true. These people will post cropped versions of the photos to make them look like the same photo. Shame on them. It is irresponsible, whiny, and even dangerous to invent media conspiracies against Israel.</p>
<p>However, there are some media outlets that used the original photo but cropped all the flags out of the photo. I think that is acceptable. The flags are cool, but distract from the important part of the photo.</p>
<p>Today is Yom HaAztmaut. We should be celebrating Israel, not complaining about manufactured controversies. I apologize for almost jumping on this bandwagon. I am glad I got off right away.</p>
<p>Here is a PDF of my original post that has been taken down: <em>(It&#8217;s fairly obvious that these are two different photos)</em></p>

The reason these latent emotions surfaced is because of the very real war that is happening right now in Israel.</p>
<p>I explained my emotions in a post that challenged the utility of war.</p>
<p>My American readers were either ambivalent, appreciative, or upset by the post, but their response to the post were nothing out of the ordinary for a post that I expected to be seen as controversial. However, my Israeli readers were mostly incensed. I was attacked in private messages in ways that made the public comments look like glowing praise. The public comments questioned my sanity, dedication to my brothers and sisters in Israel, among several other harsh judgments. To the Israeli readers, the post was seen as insensitive at best, idiotic at worst.</p>
<p>I could try to rebut or explain what I meant to those who left comments. <em>Shtika</em> is not always <em>hoda&#8217;ah</em>. But I feel that it is not useful to carry on the debate at this point. I accept your criticisms and hope you can accept this:</p>
<p><strong>I apologize.<span id="more-6481"></span></strong></p>
<p>Obviously not all people think the same way. The beauty of humanity is apparent in our differences. I understand how what I said could be perceived as callous and indifferent. It was not how I meant it at all. I understand that some people don&#8217;t like to discuss theoretical matters such as these during times of crisis. Personally, I feel that is the best time to have these discussions. But I recognize your right to disagree.</p>
<p>I absolutely do not equate the actions of the two sides in this current conflict. I continue to support my brothers and sisters in Israel. The pain and suffering of our brethren in Israel keeps me up at night and I am extremely concerned for their wellbeing. I admire the strength and courage of the soldiers and their families. Let us pray for a quick resolution to this war.</p>
<p>Please accept my apology and forgive me for being an unwelcome distraction in this time of need.</p>
<p>Maybe in a few months we can talk about what I meant in my post. But for now, I am sorry.</p>

<p>Israel is at war with Hamas. I find myself in a familiar position. That is, unable to comprehend the entire concept of war.</p>
<p>I am not writing this to question to need or wisdom of the current operation in Gaza. That is not the point here. But when my brothers and sisters are in harm&#8217;s way, I cannot but help and wonder about the concept of war.</p>
<p><strong>I want to be very clear</strong>, I support Israel and its right to defend itself. I am urging my congregation and family to have Israel in our prayers. Last night our <a href="http://daf.finkorswim.com" target="_blank">Daf Yomi</a> class was dedicated to the safety and security of our brothers and sisters in Israel. That does not mean I can&#8217;t have a discussion about war. I do not intend to minimize the importance or sacrifice of those involved in the current conflict. This is very much a theoretical discussion.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6473" title="Peaceteken1a" alt="" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Peaceteken1a.jpg?resize=300%2C199" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This is going to be short and to the point. Here are my primary issues with war:<span id="more-6471"></span></p>
<p>It seems to me that the only thing a war proves or accomplishes is that one group can be established as physically stronger or better strategists than the other group. War does not set morality or determine which group is more fit to exist (except in the Darwinian sense). The victors of the war get safety and security until someone bigger and badder than they are start up with them.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the  people fighting the war, as in the soldiers, are fighting a war for their parents. I don&#8217;t think 18 year old kids are old enough to appreciate the gravity of war. I don&#8217;t think many of them would choose to fight the war. But they are sent into harm&#8217;s way by people of authority, while those people who are making the decisions are mostly out of harm&#8217;s way. I don&#8217;t have a better alternative, but the inequity here is great.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the groups at war should be able to resolve their issues without killing one another. I know it sounds idealistic to believe this, but I honestly believe that people have the capacity to love and care for anyone. If we would spent a quarter of the resources that are used for fighting, and reallocate those resources to creating mutual experiences and friendships we would be much better off. People don&#8217;t go to war with their friends. The world is big enough for everyone to have a place in it. Yes, there are places that multiple groups want, but people know how to compromise with their friends.</p>
<p>The entire idea that since I am born in Place A and you are born in Place B means that I am right and you are wrong is something that does not fit in with modern thinking. If I was born in Gaza, I am sure I would sympathize more with Gaza. If a member of Hamas was born in Tel Aviv he would feel differently too. In other words, these convictions and affiliations that create friction are a fiction of our own creation. Why should it matter where on is born? That&#8217;s no fault of our own. We can&#8217;t control these affiliations for the most part, and so it seems borderline insane to place so much stock in these affiliations.</p>
<p>I really wish that younger, less entrenched, more idealistic people from both sides of any conflict could come together and show their leaders that they prefer peace to war. That they prefer friendship over hatred.</p>
<p>I guess, the overall point here is that when analyzed, war is pretty senseless. I understand that sometimes events that are out of our control force our hand and we find ourselves in open conflict. I just feel that if humanity could understand this, we would be a lot better off and we could focus on the progress of humanity as a whole.</p>
<p>I cry for the victims of terror. I cry for innocent civilians in Gaza who are caught in the crossfire. I cry for the families that are under constant threat of violence. I cry for people born into the worst of situations, as they are in Gaza. I cry for children who are taught that the only way out of their struggle is violence. I cry for people who feel oppressed and see no way out of their predicament. I cry for people who inherited an almost impossible to resolve problem. I cry for all of them. But most of all, I cry that we cannot resolve our differences without death and violence.</p>

It&#8217;s a really great book and a full review is forthcoming. Something struck me as I was reading the book that is relevant to Israeli politics. In light of the UNGA I thought I would share my observations.</p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles to peace in Israel is purportedly &#8220;the refugee problem&#8221;. Thousands of Arabs were displaced from their homes during the wars of 1948 and 1967. They hope to return to their homes which are now occupied by Israel. Those thousands of refugess have morphed into millions of refugees over the years.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1616200405/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1616200405&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Aleppo Codex</a>, we learn one particular Jewish community in an Arab country, Aleppo Syria. As in many Arab countries, the Jews of Aleppo Syria dated back to Second Temple era over 2000 years ago. There were many ancient Jewish communities in Arab lands. Unlike the regular persecution threat to life that Jews experienced in Europe, many Jews in the Arab lands thrived as members of society. It is fascinating to read about a completely different social experience in the Arab lands than my personal history and heritage from the European lands.<span id="more-6293"></span></p>
<p>That all changed when the State of Israel was born. In response to the Jewish state, many citizens of Arab countries rioted and made life very uncomfortable for the Jews living in those countries. Although no one was killed in Aleppo, the Jews felt unsafe and had to flee. The same thing happened in other Arab countries. The Jewish homes were looted and Jews were forced to leave.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. Why is this never mentioned? The Palestinian refugees are not the only people who lost their homes when the State of Israel was granted to the Jewish people. All the Jewish communities in the Arab countries lost their homes as well! The entire Syrian community of Brooklyn and Deal, NJ is a big refugee camp. The Persian community of Los Angeles are a giant refugee camp too! And there are many others.</p>
<p>My point is quite simple. Yes, it is true that many Arabs lost their homes in 1948 and 1967. But hundreds of thousands of Jews lost their homes as well.</p>
<p>This means two things. Thousands of years of wandering has taught our people how to pack up and start over somewhere new. Not everyone is capable of doing this. Preventing people from starting over with [false] hope that they will get their homes back from half a century ago is a form of tyranny. It also means that any conversation about refugees &#8220;returning&#8221; should begin with a modest proposal that the Jews who were ousted from Arab lands get their homes back as well.</p>
<p>Like I said, the book is excellent. Check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1616200405/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1616200405&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Aleppo Codex: A True Story of Obsession, Faith, and the Pursuit of an Ancient Bible</a> and stay tuned for the full review.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Haredi-Secular.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6127" title="Haredi-Secular" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Haredi-Secular.jpg?resize=300%2C160" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This week&#8217;s Time Magazine features a cover story on Jerusalem. Although, it is not an article about the BBC pretending that Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel, nor is it an article about East Jerusalem Arabs trying to attain Israeli citizenship. The article is about the cultural war and the turf war between secular Jews and ultra-orthodox / charedi Jews in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The focus of the article is on one &#8220;mixed&#8221; neighborhood where the charedi presence has significantly increased as the secular presence has decreased. Although the article is talking about a few individuals, the behavior described in the article can best be described as juvenile. Both sides have their villains, and in their attempt to gain control over the neighborhood both sides play pranks, vandalize, intimidate, and in general refuse to communicate.<span id="more-6124"></span></p>
<p>Sure, the article makes some technical mistakes and some incorrect assumptions, but I don&#8217;t really care about that. What I do care about is how the sad truth that in today&#8217;s society some Jews can&#8217;t figure out how to get along with each other unless the other person is just like them. That story is a story being repeated over and over again in many communities around the world.</p>
<p>Our schools and shuls are becoming more and more monolithic, our attitude toward the outside is becoming less and less tolerant, and what we are willing to do and sacrifice is becoming greater and greater for the sake of insularity. I find this trend disturbing on many levels. But the situation in Israel demonstrates to a certain degree the logical conclusion to this cycle.</p>
<p>It is a very sad state of affairs when we cannot even live happily amongst Jews. I don&#8217;t excuse the secular guerrilla warfare exposed in Time Magazine such as cutting eruv wires or slapping nude posters on synagogue walls. That is disgraceful behavior. But I also don&#8217;t excuse bullying people out of their homes or enforcing tznius standards on non-religious people.</p>
<p>If all the energy that is being used to outsmart and outwit the other side was used to figuring out how to live together, all the problems would certainly be solved. But it&#8217;s not even an option anymore. The baseline standard is to live apart from one another. I find this very sad.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that Time Magazine is a particularly good venue for this discussion, but it is a discussion that must take place. Is the goal to have a city like Jerusalem completely charedi? Is that what we are striving for? Is that what God wants from us? Will that city be a place that we can all be proud of? Is it moral to impose our religious standards on others?</p>
<p>Honestly, I can&#8217;t answer those questions with any sense of certainty. But those who are answering those questions with certainty, and are trying take control of Jerusalem or any other place in a similar situation, need to have satisfactory answers to those questions. If there is anything that this long dark exile has taught us, it is that being a minority can be very difficult. Especially when the ruling class has ideological differences with the minority. But have we only learned how to be an oppressive majority? Or are we capable of running a free, open society where orthodox Judaism can thrive alongside other ways of life?</p>
<p>I fear that the orthodox Jews who want to create orthodox Jewish cities are struggling with this. We know how to survive very well when others are in charge. Can we meet the challenge of autonomy without creating the same problems for others that we suffered throughout this exile?</p>
<p>I understand that the fear of charedi rule is mostly a fear of extremists. But the extremists are no longer so extreme. The basic standards of life in the charedi world may have been considered extreme 40 or 50 years ago. But now they are standards. Clearly, things are moving in a certain direction. The voice of moderation needs to be heard and the extremists must be silenced. If we do that, we have a chance at creating a united Jerusalem and other other towns, villages and cities as well, that are dominantly charedi but welcoming to all.</p>
<p>If we fail, I can foresee a time where non-charedim, like regular American orthodox Jews, won&#8217;t be welcome in our holiest of places because of our more moderate standards. Imagine waiting 2000 years to return to Jerusalem, only to be denied by our own brothers (and sisters). That would be a tragedy that we must avert.</p>
<p>Thank you Time Magazine for starting the conversation.</p>

<p>A while back I wrote about the IOC&#8217;s decision not to have a moment of silence for the Israeli terror victims in Munich at the &#8217;72 games. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/18/there-will-not-be-a-moment-of-silence-for-the-victims-of-terrorism-at-the-munich-olympic-games/">There Will Not Be a Moment of Silence For the Victims of Terrorism at the Munich Olympic Games</a>) I disagreed with the decision, but I also challenged those who wished to have a moment of silence to garner support for their cause and pressure the IOC, not simply demand a moment of silence.</p>
<p>That is exactly what they did.</p>
<p>People like President Obama and other world leaders past and present supported the idea of a moment of silence at the Opening Ceremonies. This has been seen as a slap in the face to Israel and Jews worldwide. Add this insult to the BBC&#8217;s incredibly narrow idea of not calling Jerusalem the capital of Israel, it&#8217;s easy to feel like everyone is out to get us.<span id="more-5872"></span></p>
<p>I just want to point out that the IOC is commemorating the Munich Massacre with a moment of silence and the IOC chairman will be attending a memorial in September in Munich, and they already had a brief moment of silence at  moment of silence in the Olympic Village (see photo above for proof).</p>
<p>These things have either already happened or will happen. The <em>only</em> thing we won&#8217;t be getting is a moment of silence at the actual Opening Ceremony. Quite honestly, I understand the reluctance toward a moment of silence at an international spectacle like the Opening Ceremony. Like it or not, the moment of silence would be polarizing and you can be sure that some knuckleheads would ruin the moment by doing something inappropriate. It&#8217;s a matter of quality control. Further, I don&#8217;t know that the Opening Ceremony is an appropriate time to put the focus on one nation. It&#8217;s true that terrorism at the Olympics affects everyone, but a moment of silence for Israel&#8217;s terror victims does take the focus off the international community and place it on one particular nation. It&#8217;s just not the right time or place. Finally, 40 is a bit of an arbitrary number. I&#8217;m uncertain why on the 40th anniversary (more than 20, 36 or 48, or 60) it was necessary to make a huge issue over the moment of silence.</p>
<p>But thankfully, the IOC is doing several other things to remember the victims of this horrible act of terrorism. Plus, Bob Costas will be leading a moment of silence on his broadcast of the Games. All in all, the 40th anniversary of the Munich Massacre will not go unremembered or unnoticed. Let us hope and pray that the message is received by those who want the moment of silence and those who need to see a moment of silence observed.</p>

To be clear, the writer is not orthodox, but the lack of apparent vibrancy from the non-orthodox seemed to swing her vote for orthodoxy as the future of Judaism in America.</p>
<p>I happen to agree. It is extremely difficult to maintain cultural and social Judaism absent ritual and observance of Jewish law. It can be done, but it is becoming more difficult with each passing generation. The proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p>The brand of orthodoxy that will prevail in America is still up for discussion. The writer of that blog post was referring to modern orthodox Judaism seeing as they are the ones she saw at the parade.</p>
<p>Another person at the parade was overwhelmed to a certain degree by the participation of the non-orthodox. This person felt that orthodoxy was not as well represented as they could and should have been. In this person&#8217;s opinion, the parade showcased non-orthodox Jews showing their passion for Israel. The orthodox Jews were like an afterthought. This person is an orthodox Jew.<span id="more-5734"></span></p>
<p>How interesting is it that two different perspectives can yield such different observations?</p>
<p>I believe that we need a combination of the two to maximize the chances of success for American Judaism. And the perfect opportunity to implement this vision is at the parade. Israel is something we all (with the exception of some fringe anti-Israel groups) can agree upon. Israel activism and AIPAC are full of orthodox Jews. Not just modern orthodox Jews. More right wing Jews strongly identify with Israel as well. The JewsNews sites report heavily on Israeli society, politics, and events. Those are sites that are read and written by right leaning (not in the political sense) orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>It seems to me that a parade for Israel is the perfect time to march together in support of a cause and in solidarity with each other. The modern orthodox community has embraced this opportunity and marches in the parade every year. But aside from a few sporadic people from the more yeshivish side of the spectrum, the Agudah / chasidic / Lakewood communities are noticeably absent from the parade.</p>
<p>I understand that there are political concerns. I understand there may be halachic concerns as well. But I just wish we could see past those, if only for one day to stand together and do something as a united Jewish people. I just wish that for once, we could all join in unison and make a clear statement on behalf of something we all agree upon.</p>
<p>In the future of American Judaism, all Jews are able to work together on the things upon which we agree, and there are many such things. The places where we disagree will still be contested. But it will be more like two opinions from the same team as opposed to two opinions from opposing teams.</p>
<p>If we are to get there, I think the New York Celebrate Israel Parade <strong>2013</strong> is a great place to start.</p>

The incident was significant for its symbolism as much as it was significant for the lives it took.</p>
<p>The Olympic Games are supposed to be a symbol of international friendship and a message to the world that despite our differences we can compete together without killing each other. Adding to the feelings of good will was the fact that Munich, Germany was hosting the games. It seemed like the perfect vision of a post-World War II world. Nations coming together to battle on the ball field instead of on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Then tragedy struck. Israeli athletes were taken hostage and their release was to be contingent on the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. A raid ensued in an attempt to rescue the Israelis and during the raid, eleven Israelis were killed. It was an international tragedy. Not only had the terrorists taken the lives of eleven innocents, but they had hijacked the Olympic Games. They turned the games from peace to war.</p>
<p>In light of the 40th anniversary of the massacre, the government of Israel requested that a moment of silence be observed at the 2012 London Games in memory of the Munich Massacre.<span id="more-5581"></span></p>
<p>In a respectful letter, the International Olympic Committee denied the request.</p>
<p>Some are taking this as an affront to Israel. One widow of a terror victim from Munich said that <em>&#8220;If the Olympic Games don&#8217;t say anything, nothing is going to change.&#8221;</em> It is hard for me to understand what she means. There have not been any terror attacks against Israelis at the Olympic Games for 40 years. Apparently, things have changed.</p>
<p>But it gets worse.</p>
<p>In the words of Danny Ayalon:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Unfortunately, this response is unacceptable as it rejects the central principles of global fraternity on which the Olympic ideal is supposed to rest. The terrorist murders of the Israeli athletes were not just an attack on people because of their nationality and religion; it was an attack on the Olympic Games and the international community. Thus it is necessary for the Olympic Games as a whole to commemorate this event in the open rather than only in a side event.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>As much as I would love to see a moment of silence at the Olympic Games, this response does not sit well with me. It seems a bit incongruous for one nation&#8217;s tragedy to create an obligation on the IOC that makes it <em>necessary</em> to have a moment of silence at the games. I appreciate that it is very important to Mr. Ayalon and to Israel, and to me, but that doesn&#8217;t make it necessary.</p>
<p>In fact, if it was not just something that Israel wanted on behalf of itself and in reality it was something that all nations would agree is important, where are the statements from all those other nations that they would like to observe a moment of silence? I have a feeling if 30-40 nations wrote &#8220;<em>amicus briefs&#8221;</em> supporting the moment of silence the response from the IOC would be different.</p>
<p>So here is my suggestion. Get the other countries to request a moment of silence and have the entire group to make a strong push for the remembrance. Lashing out at the IOC is probably not the best idea.</p>

The impression one gets from reading the news is that there is an impending Armageddon. The lines in the sand are being drawn, sides are being chosen, heroes and villains are being portrayed.</p>
<p>It is true that the governments of the two nations are ideologically opposed to one another. It is also true that much of the talk regarding this conflict comes from the fringes of each nation. The fundamentalists of Iran dreaming of a region free of the Zionist usurpers and the right wing of Israel (backed by the right wing of the United States) leaving the negotiating table, assuming there ever was a negotiating table, and embracing the challenge of a full blown military operation.</p>
<p>But what do the people want?<span id="more-5493"></span></p>
<p>For thousands of years, leaders of men have called their followers into war for the sake of whatever the leaders want. In ancient times, in medieval times, in modern times, it made no difference to the warrior if he fought under the flag of red or blue. But it mattered to the their leaders. Citizens born in Germany fought for the Axis Powers and people born in England fought for the Allied Powers.</p>
<p>The men who fight, kill, and die in war have the least to gain or lose by war. Usually, the people at the top, who are the furthest from harm&#8217;s way have the most to gain from war. If they win, they control more people. If they lose, they are relegated to civilian status or worse, they are dead.</p>
<p>War in the 21st century almost seems anachronistic. I absolutely respect and revere those heroes in the armed forces who dedicate their lives to our safety. It just seems to me that humanity&#8217;s collective resources should be more efficiently spent in our current era of enlightenment. When people were less sophisticated war made a lot more sense than it does today.</p>
<p>So what do the people of Iran and Israel want?</p>
<p>According to some peace activists in Israel and Iran, the answer is that they want peace. The rallying cry of the Israeli activists, <strong>Ronny Edry</strong> and <strong>Michal Tamar</strong> is &#8220;<em>How can I hate someone I don&#8217;t even know?</em>&#8220;. First of all, they are absolutely right. How <em>can </em>you? Taking it one step further, some Iranian peace activists on Facebook are lobbying for the Israelis to win a Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts.</p>
<p>I know there are cynics out there who think that this is all part of some plot to soften the Israelis so that they are easier to destroy in the inevitable war. There are people who will find this post offensive. There were plenty who found the cartoon at the top of this post offensive when it was floating around Facebook. But I do believe that there are good people everywhere and there are plenty of peace loving people in all countries. They may not be in positions of leadership or authority, but they exist. Harnessing the power of the Internet, these people can find a common voice and perhaps their voice of reason will prevail.</p>
<p>As our world shrinks, it is harder and harder to invent fake boogeymen for others to despise. How much longer can fascist countries lie to their citizens about freedom and liberty? I don&#8217;t think it can be much longer. The fact is that information is impossible to censor and good, intelligent, passionate people are finding that they share more in common with the average citizen of Israel or even Iran than they do with the crazy leaders who want World War III.</p>
<p>Let us hope that the Internet can help spread this message of unity and commonality among groups of people who are not yet friends. Let us hope that our young men and women will be spared the horrors of battle. Let us hope that we can find enough in common with our fellow human beings that killing another for the sake of nationalism or pride will be so abhorrent that it will be eradicated.</p>
<p>If we communicate and share common goals and experiences, we can change the way enemies view one another. There has never been a better time.</p>

En route, we made a stopover in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
<p>I know many people who are uncomfortable with anything remotely German. They do not buy products from Germany, they would never visit for recreation, and they have a general distaste for the German language. I understand these people. I am not one of them.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to let go of the feelings that associate the Holocaust to Nazis and Nazis to Germans. For some, it is disrespectful to those who perished in the Holocaust to treat Germans like everybody else. I am not judging these people. At all.</p>
<p>As I said, I am not one of these people. It could be that I had no family who fell victim to the Nazis so it is less personal for me. I like to think that I should bear no resentment towards grandchildren and great-grandchildren of murderers. After all, they committed no crime. The physical land caused us no harm and the people who caused the harm are long gone. It seems that hatred towards present day Germany is irrational at best.</p>
<p>But again, I can understand this irrational belief.</p>
<p>In fact, when I think of Frankfurt or Germany my mind immediately turns toward R&#8217; Hirsch and then to the incredible legacy of German Torah and Judaism stretching back to the first exile 2500 years ago.</p>
<p>Just because I have positive feelings towards modern Germany does not mean that the recent significance of the place is lost on me. I felt a particularly strong stirring inside me as our El Al jet raced down the runway and took off towards Israel. The surge of emotion that I felt brought tears to my eyes. It relates to Pesach and I think provides us a nice message as we begin this year&#8217;s Pesach celebration.<span id="more-5380"></span></p>
<p>What would our brothers and sisters have done 70 years ago to hop on a plane in Franfurt and fly to Israel. First of all, they were not free to leave. They were in concentration camps, death camps, in death marches, in hiding, or on the run. Our Jewish brothers and sisters could not just leave the country like I did today.</p>
<p>More importantly, they had no Land of Israel to go to! Today, any Jew who wants to go home has a home in Israel. Seventy years ago, there was no Jewish homeland. Today there is a Jewish homeland. Imagine the emotional lift the victims of the Holocaust may have felt had they known that if they survived, they would be able to settle in Israel.</p>
<p>So taking off in Germany and landing in Israel on an El Al plane is a powerful thing. We cannot overlook how lucky we are that we can choose to freely make that trip that so many before us have yearned for so strongly.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that we should also pause and reflect on these modern times where previously held and entrenched (false) ideas about people who are different from one another are slowly being purged from our global community. There is plenty of work to be done. But it is worth considering how far we have come as well.</p>
<p>As we head into Pesach and we are commanded to feel the freedom our forefathers felt as they left Egypt, it seems prudent to revisit the more recent euphoric redemption that rose from the ashes of the Holocaust. In these heady times of freedom and a Jewish homeland it can be difficult to conjure up the emotions of a nation in slavery in search for a homeland. For more than 1500 years, the seder was a rallying call to return to the land of Israel and to feel free once again. Today we are free and we can all go to Israel if we chose to do so.</p>
<p>We have so much for which we must be thankful. The Jewish world today is nothing like the Jewish world from which so many of our grandparents and great grandparents came. Sometimes, it takes an El Al flight from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv mere hours before Pesach to put it all in perspective.</p>
<p>Wishing everyone a chag kasher v&#8217;sameach.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about visiting Israel is the diversity of Jewish people, practices and customs. In particular, the Kotel is a special place for so many Jewish people and even non-Jewish people. I always marvel at the beauty of the stones and all the people there to soak in their glory.</p>
<p>The only shul that I know of that rivals the Kotel in diversity is the <a href="pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Shul on the Beach</a> where I am the rabbi. It really is remarkable. It is not quite the diversity of the Kotel, but Pacific Jewish Center is probably a slightly distant second.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some people who do not value diversity. Some people desire uniformity in action, thought and dress. The latest victim of this attitude was chronicled in a recent AP article.</p>
<p>The Israeli rabbinate has proclaimed that the Ethiopian Jewish community religious leaders, called kessoch, no longer be recognized by the State of Israel. The control over who is recognized as a legitimate spiritual leader in Israel is in the hands of the Rabbinate.<span id="more-5067"></span></p>
<p>At this point, most, if not all of the kessoch have abandoned their traditional dress and now conform to the standard of Ashkenazik rabbis who wear dark suits, white shirts and black hats. Traditionally, the kessoch worse turbans and clothing that is appropriate for a community with roots in North Africa.</p>
<p>Some of their customs were already abandoned when they emigrated to Israel. These were customs that varied greatly from the practiced version of orthodox Judaism in Israel. But now, they are being forced to completely assimilate into the dominant version of Judaism in Israel.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of whether or not the Ethiopian Jews are legitimate. The working assumption is that they have converted if necessary and are now full-fledged Jews. The issue is that once they are Jews, they are not being permitted to have official rabbis who hail from their communities. These communities were self regulated and ruled for hundreds and hundreds of years. Now, they are being forced to give that up.</p>
<p>I find it sad and ironic the Jews are forcing assimilation on other Jews.</p>

Whether or not the Marines who performed the stunt intended for it to be a hateful act or were just horsing around is not the issue. Either way, it was wrong.</p>
<p>It also sheds light on how these Marines perceive their enemies.</p>
<p>One does not act in this manner towards an enemy with whom one has a mutual respect. Nor is there any room for mercy or compassion in the eyes of these Marines. If there were, it would be impossible to urinate on enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>It reminded me of a story one my congregants told me about his experience in the Six Day War in 1967. (Side note: How awesome would it be if we could have had a six day war in Afghanistan or Iraq instead of these endless campaigns&#8230;)</p>
<p><span id="more-5044"></span></p>
<p>Anyway, my congregant who we shall call Joe and his partner shot down an Egyptian fighter jet and captured the pilot. The partner was about to kill the enemy soldier when Joe interjected. Joe said to his partner that it would be wrong to kill the enemy. At this point he was incapacitated and posed no threat to them. Further, there is no reason to feel vengeance against him, he is just fighting for his country in the same way that we are fighting for ours. Joe prevailed and they let the enemy pilot live. The pilot so appreciated Joe&#8217;s gesture that they became friendly and even exchanged personal information. The war ended and the pilot was released and he went home.</p>
<p>Some time later, Joe was in Egypt and he wanted to pay a visit to this pilot. He tracked him down and the pilot was ecstatic that Joe had come to visit. He told anyone who would listen that Joe was the man that saved his life. Joe, says that this was one of the most rewarding moments of his life.</p>
<p>War is evil. Sometimes it is a necessary evil. But even within war there is a way to maintain perspective of the human element of the enemy. The demonification of the enemy may boost morale or even recruitment numbers. But I think it comes at a cost of humanity that is so valuable, especially through the challenges of war.</p>
<p>These Marines could learn a thing or two from Joe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/stop-sign.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4988" title="stop-sign" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/stop-sign-300x193.jpg?resize=300%2C193" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Thugs and hoodlums from extremist religious groups in Israel have been terrorizing fellow Jews for some time now. They have done so without fear of condemnation or retribution from the religiously adjacent charedi community. This recent wave of violence is not new nor is it shocking or surprising.</p>
<p>Spitting on young girls, calling women whores, forcing segregation at bus stops and on buses are all acts cut from the same cloth as the violence at Manny&#8217;s Bookshop and a political beating in Meah Shearim. We&#8217;ve known about this for a while. Nobody has said a word.</p>
<p>However, this time the media found out about it. So now it&#8217;s national and international news.</p>
<p>This has prompted responses and condemnations from rabbis, rabbinic authorities and lay people. That&#8217;s great. Finally. The problem is that these condemnations are so weak, hedged and long-winded that they, in my opinion, are a failure.</p>
<p>There is only one way to condemn violence and abuse towards women. That would be something like this:<span id="more-4987"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>We strongly condemn any and all violence towards women under any and all circumstances. Those who commit such acts of violence will feel the full effect and power of the religious and secular court system. They will be excommunicated from all religious circles and are heretofore to be considered persona non grata. If you know of any individuals who have abused anyone, whether verbally or physically notify the police and rabbinic leadership immediately.</strong></p>
<p>What we don&#8217;t need is an explanation of how these people are not &#8220;real charedim&#8221;. We don&#8217;t need poetry on the majesty of tznius. We don&#8217;t need snide remarks about the secular media. Just speak out against violence, promise retribution and to take action.</p>
<p>Enough with the apologetics and handwringing.</p>
<p><em>Feel free to copy and paste my version of an appropriate condemnation on all the blogs and news sites that have published the watered down condemnations to this point. If you can, please credit this blog. Thanks.</em></p>

Riding in the back of the bus has become identified with discrimination.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that when Hillary! Clinton, feminist extraordinaire, expressed her dismay when she heard that a democratic country like Israel had bus routes that were segregated by gender. On several bus routes in Israel men are in the front and women ride in back.</p>
<p>Hillary!&#8217;s comments drew the ire of many religious Jews. To them, this was such a minor issue in the grand scheme of things, and so unrelated to foreign affairs that Hillary! could only have been commenting on the bus situation because she is a jerk / anti-Semite / hates Israel / liberal / feminist / whatever. Now, I concede that Hillary! probably should not have created a big deal out of the segregated buses. However, I agree with her dismay.</p>
<p>There are three very big problems with these segregated buses.<span id="more-4964"></span></p>
<p>1) They are illegal. I am indebted to <a href="twitter.com/noahroth" target="_blank">Noah Roth</a> for summarizing the Supreme Court of Israel&#8217;s ruling that public transportation may not be segregated. The reasoning for the holding is similar to the separate <em>is not</em> equal argument that was made in Brown v. Board of Education in the Supreme Court of the United States. The bus drivers are not supposed to let the bus riders enforce a &#8220;voluntary&#8221; segregation and there is litigation in the lower Israeli courts right now attempting to force the drivers to enforce the law.</p>
<p>2) They are halachically unnecessary. Halachically speaking, there is no requirement for segregation between men and women. Some will argue that men and women are not allowed to touch each other and incidental touching is very likely to occur in a crowded bus. This has already been deemed a non-issue by R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein (Even HaEver 5:14). In his responsa, R&#8217; Moshe says that incidental touching on a bus is not a problem because it is not &#8220;derech chiba&#8221; which means that it is not intimate touching. (Again, HT Noah Roth for the cite.)</p>
<p>3) Segregated buses are a big deal with minimal benefit. Let&#8217;s assume that &#8220;kedushas einayim&#8221; is a super-vital element of worshiping God. (I believe it is overblown, but lets pretend that it&#8217;s not overblown for a moment). Does that mean that it is more valuable than many other Torah values? Does that mean that it is more important to have one&#8217;s eyes averted by default than it is to demean women?</p>
<p>If you are an apologist, you are saying to yourself that the women volunteer to move to the back, so what is the big deal? The big deal is the message it sends. It sends a message to the public that we appear to discriminate against women. Even if you don&#8217;t believe that seperate buses are discriminatory, and I concede that in some situations they might not be, they send a message to the less informed public that we do discriminate. This is an awful message. Not only does it affect our interactions with our non-Jewish friends and neighbors but I believe that the message of segregated buses to the public reflects back upon us and affirms to us that we are in fact discriminating. In other words, what others think of us can affect how we feel about our own actions.</p>
<p>But I think the more important message is the message we give ourselves when we institute (or tolerate) separate buses.  The message is that people are so highly sexualized that a casual encounter with any woman is enough to wreak havoc on a man&#8217;s soul. This is not a new trend, but no less disturbing. Charedi periodicals don&#8217;t show pictures of women. Even modestly dressed women. Even saintly women. None. (Let&#8217;s not forget that Hillary! was photoshopped out of a historic photo by a Charedi publication.) Little girls are not portrayed either. In fact, I&#8217;ve seen periodicals that had the faces of female INFANTS blurred out. That is sick.</p>
<p>This is a real problem. First of all, it legitimizes thinking sexually about every female in the world. It&#8217;s as if there is no choice. Women are purely sexual and we are helpless to our base desires. It says that it is impossible for men and women to interact normally.</p>
<p>It also tells our community that women are required to be out of the public eye no matter what. They are the unseen and unheard part of our community. I believe we lose a strong voice in our community if women are marginalized or at the least, made to think that that they suffer an incurable disease of attractiveness. We should focus our attention and efforts into learning how to function as normal, healthy, well-adjusted people in a society of men and women. Fighting this hard for separate buses indicates a horrible state of missed priorities.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the buses will reintegrate and holy Jews will learn how to be holy in the real world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/newt-2012.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4903" title="newt-2012" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/newt-2012.png?resize=300%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>GOP Candidate and Presidential hopeful, Newt Gingrich has made headlines with his recent claim that the Palestinians are an Invented People. The responses from across the idealogical and political spectrum have been as wild and varied as to be expected.</p>
<p>On one extreme, representatives of the Palestinians fired back at Gingrich. In a statement, they called Gingrich racist and said that his was the worst kind of insult that would only help the cycle of violence. On the other extreme are those nodding their heads in agreement at the prospect of a President who agrees with their perspective on the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the fact-checkers have confirmed and debunked Gingrich&#8217;s claim. There is evidence that the Palestinians existed as a small subgroup in the land that is currently Israel. However, there is little evidence that they had any sense of national pride or unity as a group before the State of Israel was established.</p>
<p>What strikes me is how silly this whole thing is.<span id="more-4902"></span> Gingrich&#8217;s comment could be equally said about a myriad of nations and peoples. It could really be said about anybody! What qualifies a nation as a &#8220;non-invented&#8221; people? How long do those people need to be where they are to be considered legitimate?</p>
<p>Is the United States of America not invented? Is the United Kingdom not Invented? Is Mexico not invented? Even historically ethnic countries such as Japan or Sweden are practically speaking &#8220;invented&#8221;. They lived in close proximity for a long time and eventually created a sense of national pride and unity. But they were not magically granted the land in which they live by some objective method of determining land division. Clearly land is not given only to nations who are not invented.</p>
<p>Further, let&#8217;s assume for a second that Gingrich is correct. The Palestinians are invented and invented people don&#8217;t get land. Now what? What are you going to do about it? Nuke the West Bank? Manufacture a tsunami and drown Gaza? There are millions of these so-called invented people. What now? Point being, invented or not, there is an issue that needs to be dealt with. By simply saying they are invented does nothing to resolve that issue. In fact, it probably has the opposite effect. It entrenches both sides and polarizes the parties.</p>
<p>And what about Gingrich himself? He is a Catholic. Is that an invented religion? If it is not, well that means that all other religions are invented. So are they all not granted the right to exist simply because they are invented? Everything is invented. Mazel tov.</p>
<p>Which brings us full circle. Gingrich said that Palestinians are an invented people simply to anger some people and excite others. It was a political statement that carries less meaning than most political statements. It is the kind of broad brushed, meaningless statement for which politics is famous.</p>
<p>I think the voting public would prefer to hear about solutions to a decades long conflict instead of whimsical platitudes. I wonder if Gingrich has any ideas for the conflict or if he can&#8217;t be bothered to deal with invented people.</p>

(<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/09/22/read-maimonides-personally-authorized-copy-of-his-mishnah-torah/">Read Maimonides’ Personally Authorized Copy of His Mishnah Torah</a>) This week the Google sponsored Dead Sea Scrolls project went live.</p>
<p>In the old days only a small, select, elite group of people had access to ancient texts and manuscripts. The Internat is changing that.</p>
<p>As of this moment, anyone with access to the Internet can study the Dead Sea Scrolls. Google has partnered with The Israel Museum to bring the Dead Sea Scrolls to the public. And now it is done.</p>
<p>This is a revolutionary accomplishment. It completely democratizes scholarship of the scrolls. As it relates to the Dead Sea Scrolls, this is a complete about face from the early years of Dead Sea Scrolls scholarship that was ruled by various factions that controlled their accessibility.</p>
<p>That is over now.</p>
<p>Anyone and everyone can read these important scrolls. I doubt many non-experts will be able to glean much from the manuscripts but their availability will certainly escalate the level of scholarship and engender a greater number of potential scholars of the scrolls.<span id="more-4669"></span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have seen comments on websites and blogs that are using this monumental achievement to criticize religion. These are the kinds of people that do not appreciate the non-religious significance of these scrolls.</p>
<p>That tells me that they are ignorant and probably just bigoted. The Dead Sea Scrolls provide a unique window into a world that is fascinating and relevant. Three major religions of the world draw from the wisdom in these texts. Millions of people use the interpretations of these texts as the basis for their very lives. To say that these scrolls are useless because &#8220;religion is a lie&#8221; or there is no point to these scrolls because &#8220;they were written by mortal men&#8221; completely ignores reality. Even if those contentions are true (I would argue that at least parts of those statements are patently false with regard to the Dead Sea Scrolls) the wealth of information to be learned from these ancient texts is almost infinite.</p>
<p>Great primer on the significance of the Dead Sea Scrolls: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea_Scrolls" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>My cousins&#8217; grandfather was one of the world experts on the scrolls. Unfortunately, he passed a few years ago. You can read about him and his accomplishments here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_M._Baumgarten" target="_blank">Joseph Baumgarten</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/gems_e_a000012012.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4481" title="gems_e_a000012012" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/gems_e_a000012012-300x225.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In today&#8217;s NY Times there is an important article showing a more human side of the current conflict in Israel.</p>
<p>According to the Times, it is illegal for a Palestinian from the West Bank to travel to Israel without a permit. A group of Israeli women decided to take a group of Palestinian women to the beach. They all broke the law. The Israeli and Palestinian can be criminally prosecuted. So far, only some of the Israelis have been questioned. None charged.</p>
<p>For the Palestinian women it was their first trip to the beach in their lives. Many of these women are relatives of militants in Israeli prisons. One of them had a brother who was killed while brandishing a knife in a settlement Yeshiva.<span id="more-4480"></span></p>
<p>To be sure, one can certainly take issue with some of the sentiments of the Israeli women and certainly with some of the sentiments of the Palestinian women. I need not point out the obvious. You will see it when you read it.</p>
<p>What is worth noting is that the article makes it super clear that these women experienced a freedom that is completely foreign to them. And they experienced it while in Israeli territory. They were able to smoke in public, dance in public, take off some of their traditional garb and perhaps most of all, they were able to develop relationships with Israelis.</p>
<p>It is part of broader project that involves providing medical and legal assistance to Palestinian women and recently they helped open a kindergarten by donated toys. The women are trying to establish their own rapport with each other and not rely on the rhetoric of their leaders to form their opinions. That is a good thing.</p>
<p>The truth is, I believe that the experience of freedom from militant rule is at least as liberating as the experience of freedom from Israeli rule. The best case scenario for them under militant rule is not even close to the best case scenario under Israeli rule.</p>
<p>It is my hope, that by fostering friendships, experiencing true freedom and dispelling the notion that all Israelis want to kill all Palestinians, a mutual understanding can be reached between citizens, even if the leaders are still lagging behind.</p>

<p>During our trip, we had one group tour scheduled. We were all invited to join a Western Wall Tunnel Tour. At first, I was not that interested. After all, I had been on several Tunnel Tours already, and my tours were with the absolute best Tunnel Tours guide of all time, Esther Schlisser OB&#8217;M. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/30/mourning-the-living-on-the-9th-of-av/">Mourning The Living On The 9th of Av</a>). So I was reluctant to go again with a subpar tour guide.</p>
<p>I went anyway and I am glad I did. On that tour, I learned something very, very interesting.</p>
<p>For many reasons, I was always intrigued by the Western Wall. One thing that I often thought about was that when the Temple stood, it was a pretty meaningless wall. It was a retaining wall for the Temple Mount. Functional, not spiritual. The Midrash tells us that the Western Wall will never be destroyed. It also tells us that there is a concentration of spirituality in the Western Wall.</p>
<p>It is apparent that the wall transformed for our great rabbis after the destruction of the Temple from mundane to meaningful. But I had not heard of a source that speaks of prayer at the Western Wall. So I always wondered when it became a place of prayer.</p>
<p>During this recent Tunnel Tour I think I  got my answer.<span id="more-4212"></span></p>
<p>The Western Wall that we see today is really just the southern corner of the western wall that surrounded the Temple Mount. The western wall was much larger than it seems today. Larger in height and significantly longer from south to north. The Tunnel Tour takes you along the wall going north so that you actually pass the area immediately west of the Temple and the Holy of Holies. It continues beyond the Temple footprint as well.</p>
<p>As you walk north there are several gates or arches that were once used to enter the Temple Mount. They were filled in many years ago but the outline of the arch is still discernible.</p>
<p>One of these gates is called Warren&#8217;s Gate. Warren was an archaeologist who did not discover the arch. A friend, Wilson, named it after his friend. This gate is very close to the area that is immediately opposite the Holy of Holies. It is the closest gate to that area.</p>
<p>At one time, the gate led to a series of steps that one could take to the Temple Mount. After the Temple was destroyed, Jews were prohibited by the conquering Romans and subsequently the Christians from praying in the area.</p>
<p>When the Arabs took control of Jerusalem (in the 600&#8217;s CE) they permitted the Jews to pray in the area of the gate and due to its proximity to the Holy of Holies, the area actually became a synagogue.</p>
<p>In the Cairo Geniza a prayer was found that describes a pilgrimage to the Temple Mount. The Jews would come to Jerusalem from far and wide, they would circle the Temple Mount on foot and pray at each of the gates. In 1033 an earthquake damaged Warren&#8217;s Gate and letters found in the Geniza show that the Jews tried to raise funds from wealthier Jews to help pay for the repairs of the gate as it held much value to them. It seems that it was important that they be able to make their pilgrimages and pray at Warren&#8217;s Gate.</p>
<p>I believe that these Jews set the precedent for praying at the Western Wall. Warren&#8217;s Gate was synagogue long before the area that we call the Western Wall today. It was those Jews who made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem beginning in the 7th century that established the Western Wall as a place of prayer, a powerful tradition that is kept to this very day.</p>
<p><em>The tour also opened my eyes to the incredible significance of the Cairo Geniza. I have taken a strong interest in the Geniza beginning with reading </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805242589/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=0805242589"><em>Sacred Trash: The Lost and Found World of the Cairo Geniza</em></a><em> which will be reviewed on the blog sometime soon.</em></p>

<p>For many religious people, the most important city in the world is Jerusalem. In the early days of the city, after King David purchased the Temple Mount and the First Temple was built by his son King Solomon the city of Jerusalem was not where the &#8220;Old City&#8221; is today. It was on the opposite side of the Temple Mount. The &#8220;Old City&#8221; is a much newer city probably around 500 years old. It&#8217;s possible that people inhabited the area currently known as the Old City as early as the late Second Temple period, but it wasn&#8217;t formally fortified with the walls in their current position until about 500 years ago.</p>
<p>The Old City is rich in religious significance and religion. The Western Wall, the holiest site for Jews, is in the Old City as are the Dome of Rock and Al Aqsa Mosque, two of the most important holy places for Muslims. Additionally, Christians place special significance on several places in the Old City including the  Church of the Holy Sepulchre.<span id="more-4011"></span></p>
<p>The Old City is divided into &#8220;Quarters&#8221;. The Quarters are not a quarter a piece. They are randomly shaped and sized. The smallest quarter is the Armenian and the second smallest quarter is the Jewish Quarter. The largest quarter is the Arab Quarter. Very few Jews live in the Arab Quarter. (Now, there are more than there had been for quite some time.) One of the more well known Jewish residents of the Arab Quarter is a family named Zilberman. They are also famous for their famed (and perhaps slightly controversial) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilberman_Method" target="_blank">Torah academy for boys</a>.</p>
<p>It happens that a cousin of my wife married a Zilberman. But not one of the children of the residents of the Arab Quarter. That is his uncle.</p>
<p>He offered to take us to his uncle&#8217;s house and show us around. We immediately took him up on the offer.</p>
<p>The Zilbermans live pretty deep into the Arab Quarter. We walked through the Arab Shuk (market) and then up and around a few streets that I had never been on before despite my many trips to Jerusalem. I had never been through the main thoroughfares of the Arab Quarter before.</p>
<p>We arrived at their home.</p>
<div id="attachment_4013" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110550.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4013" title="P1110550" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110550.jpg?resize=640%2C480" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In Hebrew: Zilberman</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Their home is neighbored on one side by a Muslim family and on the other by a Christian family. The three of them get along well. They share a cup of coffee (literal, not figurative) every so often.</p>
<p>The first thing that was pointed out to us as we entered the home was something in the threshold. It was a nook for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezuzah" target="_blank">mezuza</a>. The nook is carved out of the wall so that a mezuza can be placed near the door. It is nearly impossible to affix a mezuza to stone so the nook is necessary. Interestingly enough, the nook was there when the Zilbermans bought the home about 10 years ago. This means that is was either built for Jewish inhabitants when it was first constructed or sometime along the way a Jewish family lived there. That was very interesting to me.</p>
<div id="attachment_4014" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110551.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4014" title="P1110551" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110551.jpg?resize=640%2C480" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The nook for the mezuza is in the center</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">We went through the doorway and saw the entrance-way to the home. It is a very narrow house with at least 3 stories. The bottom level is the dining room. The room was full of garbage when they bought the home. They cleared it out and removed all the rubble and created a beautiful new space. The Zilbermans host a huge Shabbos meal (just about) every week. Their entertaining room is used as a place to welcome hundreds and hundreds of guests into their home every Shabbos. The room is beautiful.</p>
<div id="attachment_4015" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110529.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4015" title="P1110529" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110529.jpg?resize=640%2C480" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Zilbermans dining room</p></div>
<p>The real treat of the home is the balcony. The Zilbermans have several balconies. The uppermost balcony has a view that most Jewish people don&#8217;t get to experience. The Zilberman&#8217;s home is much further north than any other Jewish homes so that the view of the Temple Mount is more straight away as opposed to on an angle. From the balcony there is a clear view of the Temple Mount square. The stone tiling on the floor of the Temple Mount is a rare sight for Jews seeing as we are prohibited from approaching the Temple Mount by Jewish law and the views from the Jewish Quarter don&#8217;t quite get the right angle. Here is the view looking a bit south from the Zilberman&#8217;s balcony. If you look carefully to the left of the photo you can make out some of the Temple Mount floor.</p>
<div id="attachment_4016" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110537.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4016" title="P1110537" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110537.jpg?resize=640%2C480" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">View from the Zilberman&#39;s balcony</p></div>
<p>After we took some photos from the balcony we went back down to the dining room for some group photos and to ask a few more questions. Down there we also saw a very old cistern in the dining room bathroom. They also have an album of the construction of their home while they were living there. It was a very ambitious project and it turned out really well. I also got to take a photo with my wife&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s husband (a Zilberman) and just writing that, makes me realize how fortunate I am to have such wonderful family to share experiences and learn from.</p>
<div id="attachment_4017" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110549.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4017" title="P1110549" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/P1110549.jpg?resize=640%2C480" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me and my wife&#39;s cousin&#39;s husband (it was cold and rainy - hence the sweater and coat)</p></div>
<p>Before we left I just had to ask how their relationship was with their non-Jewish neighbors. The answer was that they got along really well. As I mentioned above, they have coffee together every now and again. They consider their non-Jewish neighbors their friends. I asked what happens between them when there is tension or even terror attacks. I was told that their relationship is unaffected by the actions and rhetoric of others. They have mutual respect for one another and what happens politically or militarily is not of very important consequence between friends. I have to say, I was impressed with that approach and it mirrors my personal experiences as well.</p>
<p>The Zilbermans believe that they are doing good work by making a kiddush Hashem in an area that is generally devoid of Jewish influence and spirituality. They are doing a great job at that. I believe that they are a wonderful example of devotion to religion and tolerance.</p>
<p>We all can learn from them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/itamar_fogel-family.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3907" title="itamar_fogel family" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/itamar_fogel-family.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I was in Israel during the Itamar murders. I was in Israel when the Fogel family was slaughtered in their home. The Israelis I encountered over the days following the attack were split between those in agony and those who refused to contemplate the horror of the attack because it was too painful to consider. It was truly a national tragedy.</p>
<p>Aside from the humanity of the pain and suffering there was political trauma as well. Those who are more right wing were upset that the more lax parts of the Israeli government would even talk with Palestinians about peace. &#8220;There is no peace process&#8221; when a savage can murder a family in their home. Those who are more left wing were disappointed that their peace partners did not do more to prevent the atrocity.<span id="more-3906"></span></p>
<p>As a law student, the first thing I thought of in a legal sense was what would happen in the USA under similar circumstances. I understand that the circumstances are completely different in the USA. I am speaking only hypothetically.</p>
<p>Typically, when 5 people from one family are killed in their home we would consider it a murder. The police would investigate. There would be a search for the serial murderer. Hopefully he would be caught and brought to justice in a court of law. A lawyer would defend him. The prosecution would need to prove their case. The jury would decide the defendant&#8217;s fate. In some states he might even get the death penalty. But before that, there would be several appeals.</p>
<p>When 5 family members living in an Israeli settlement are murdered in their home it is called terrorism. The suspect may be apprehended by the Israeli Defense Forces. He may be assassinated by the IDF. He may be placed in a military prison and exchanged for other prisoners of war left to sit out his days in Palestinian prison.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very different.</p>
<p>But what is so different about the circumstances that makes one person a murderer and one person a terrorist? It&#8217;s not a question that can be taken lightly. We can&#8217;t just answer it by saying &#8220;it&#8217;s obvious&#8221;.</p>
<p>Do we look to motive? Is it because one murderer was trying to kill a family and the other murderer was trying to kill Jews? That&#8217;s not sufficient because we have hate crime enhancements in the USA that deal with crimes like these.</p>
<p>Is it simply that every murder caused by a Palestinian against a Jew is terror? I am not happy with that either. It be similar to the painfully archaic &#8220;gang enhancement&#8221; in the USA that basically makes any crime a memeber of a gang commits a felony in the furtherance of the gang, even when its not. That is not a good rule either.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because when you take all the factors of the murders and all the facts of the circumstances and all the facts of the murderer the only logical conclusion is that it is terrorism? But is that true? Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p>The optimistic part of me still wishes that the heinous act was the work of a crazed man working alone, against the wishes of his friends, family, neighbors and government. I honestly wish we could believe that the murders were just that; murders. I wish I could be absolutely confident that this murderer is a social outcast and acted contrary to the beliefs of his environment.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, it&#8217;s seems painfully obvious that this was an act of terror. I just wish I knew how I knew that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-future.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3716" title="the-future" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-future.jpg?resize=300%2C239" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>If you&#8217;ve known me for a little while you know I am an optimist. If we&#8217;ve talked about the conflict in the Middle East you know I am optimistic about that too.</p>
<p>For a little while now (at least a couple of years) I have maintained that the conflict will in effect, resolve itself, eventually.</p>
<p>Until recently, Gazans and West Bank Palestinians have heard one voice. A voice that told them in categorical terms that their life would be better under autonomous rule by Hamas or the PLO. Palestinians believed them. It created fanatics, fascists and suicide bombers. But people can only be told a lie so long as there is no evidence to the contrary.<span id="more-3710"></span></p>
<p>If someone tells you that the world is flat you know he is lying because you have information that shows him to be lying. Information is king. Therefore, I have contended that my generation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y" target="_blank">Generation Y</a>) is the information generation. My generation does not accept lies or legends at face value. We know there is a way to learn on our own to unmask lies passed off as facts or legends passed off as history. We are the Wikipedia generation. We know that the information is available and we are willing to find it ourselves.</p>
<p>So long as information can be controlled, the public will kneel to authority, corrupt or otherwise. But once information is freely available to the masses, the lies unravel, the legends are exposed and truth can prevail. Authority that told those lies and legends is discarded and the people want truth, a voice and democracy. I have been saying that my generation of Palestinians and Muslims in general who have access to information will undoubtedly prefer to join the West in its freedoms, capitalism and democracy.</p>
<p>When the choices are death or unilateral agreement with authority, the choice is easy. When the choice is money, entertainment, enlightenment or unilateral agreement with authority, the choice is even easier. With the wave of unbridled information entering the oppressed masses in Arab countries, fundamental fanaticism will be replaced with a thirst for information and the allure of modern civilization. A lifestyle of books and e-books, Facebook and Twitter, Playstation and XBOX, e-commerce and ebay sure as heck beats a Third World existence. This is why my generation will resolve the conflict. Conflict serves no one but the elite and corrupt leaders. It will mean out with oppressive rulers and in with freedom.</p>
<p>The beginnings of this movement has already been formed in Gaza. A few weeks ago the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/02/free-gaza-youth-manifesto-palestinian" target="_blank">Guardian reported</a> on a &#8220;Manifesto&#8221; written by disgruntled Palestinians. They don&#8217;t want Hamas, they don&#8217;t want Fatah, they don&#8217;t want Israel, they want freedom.</p>
<p>What happened in Tunisia and what is happening right now in Egypt is more of the same. The people will not be controlled by corrupt Heads of State who demand allegiance for no reason other than &#8220;I said so&#8221;. The people want their freedom. They want what we have in the West. And they will get it. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/28/president-reagans-message-for-protesters-in-egypt/">President Reagan’s Message for the Protesters in Egypt</a>)</p>
<p>A little bit of patience and gentle prodding from the West will help the next generation of Arabs achieve their emancipation. I maintain that 9/11 was a final salvo. The fundamentalist establishment tried one last time to supress the free flow of information by trying to destroy it. They failed and freedom is around the corner.</p>
<p>Just ask the protestors in Tunisia and Egypt.</p>
<p>I do admit that the protests are not without flaws. It is entirely possible that the new leaders will be equally despotic as their predecessors. We can only hope that will not be the case. But even if it is, it won&#8217;t last long. Change is coming. The cat is out of the bag and freedom is like a drug that is addictive and readily available. The public won&#8217;t be satisfied until they can drink the elixir of freedom. And they will.</p>
<p>This phenomena has also affected the orthodox Jewish community. The more information that becomes available, the more the religious leaders are concerned about losing their authority. This is silly. The authority of rabbis was never binding except in a rabbinic court or perhaps via an uncontested responsa. It is a folly of this generation&#8217;s leadership (or its handlers) that asserted this unilateral power. It never existed and yes, with information this imagined power will disappear. This is why the Internet is so feared by these rabbis. That is why the Internet is banned in charedi circles. It is because of the information and free flow of ideas that the Internet provides which in turn minimizes their invented power. Orthodox Judaism does not depend on charismatic or authoritarian rabbis, it depends of individual commitment to Jewish law and theology. Information is a boon to that kind of religious practice. If we are confident in orthodox Judaism as a viable way of life, information must be a friend, not a foe. I know that I am confident, I can&#8217;t say the same for those who cower in fear from information.</p>
<p>The future is now, or coming soon enough. The Internet is giving people a thirst for freedom and independence. Totalitarianism cannot win against the almost infinite amount of information that is easily accessible from a <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">device smaller</a> than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoPf98i8A0g" target="_blank">George Costanza&#8217;s wallet</a>.</p>
<p>Say hello to the future.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>

The issue is Jewish criticism of Israel. But the sub-issue is when Jews call others &#8220;not real Jews&#8221;. Of course knee jerk reactionaries will say the NY Times is Anti-Semitic and Cohen has no credibility etc. In my opinion. that just proves his point.</p>
<p>This &#8220;you&#8217;re not a Jew&#8221; calling happens all the time. In Judaism there are so many passionate causes and ideals that sometimes those who believe in some of those causes and ideals feel like they have a license to determine one&#8217;s Jewishness or lack thereof by their commitment of lack thereof of that cause or ideal. (See this post for more: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/28/our-penchant-for-defining-ourselves-by-excluding-others/">Our Penchant For Defining Ourselves By Excluding Others</a>)</p>
<p>The subject of the article is a liberal American Jew who was in Israel for a year. There were several incidents that were disturbing but the worst incident was on his way back from a rally carrying a sign that said &#8220;Zionists are not settlers&#8221;.<span id="more-3445"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A group of religious Jews wearing yarmulkes approached, spat on them and started punching.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“About 20 people saw the whole thing and just watched. They were screaming, ‘You are not real Jews.’ Most of them were American. It was one of the most disappointing moments of my life — you can disagree as much as you want with a banner but to allow violence and not react is outrageous. For me it was a turning point. Nobody previously had said I was not a real Jew.”</em></p>
<p>Obviously, this is horrible and I am ashamed. Jews should not be beating up other Jews for expressing an opinion. The aggressors clearly believe that the protestor is not &#8220;Jewy enough&#8221; to warrant their concern. It&#8217;s fine to beat him up because he is not &#8220;one of us&#8221;. It&#8217;s disappointing to see and it really calls into question the legitimacy of their position.</p>
<p>Cohen then goes on to argue (by implication) that all liberal Jews (and non-Jews) must disagree with Zionism and settlements. Further, Cohen says that really the president wants to exercise more pressure on Israel to change their policies toward the Palestinians. He uses the word &#8220;occupation&#8221; a few times as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine for Cohen to express his opinions. That doesn&#8217;t bother me. What does bother me is that he is guilty of a similar flaw he exposes in Zionists. Cohen is basically saying that you are not a good American Jew if you don&#8217;t criticize Israel. That is just as egregious as the Zionist calling the more liberal Jew &#8220;not a Jew&#8221;.</p>
<p>And what of this claim? If it was an anecdote in an Op-Ed I would try to tell Cohen to be less reactionary and chalk it up to a few morons. But unfortunately this is not the case. I have seen what Cohen describes with my own eyes.</p>
<p>Well meaning Jews will tell anyone who criticizes Israel as a traitor or less of a Jew. It happens. I have seen it.</p>
<p>If we cannot be critical of ourselves then of whom can we be critical.</p>
<p>If the reaction to anyone that disagrees is that &#8220;you are not one of us&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t speak well for the confidence in that position. If there is no conversation, no discussion, just &#8220;not a Jew&#8221; knee jerk responses nothing will change.</p>
<p>The situation is incredibly complex. Israel was granted to the Jews by the U.N.  but there were non-Jews living there. That must have hurt. A lot. Many of their supporters refuse to recognize Israel as a legitimate country. That hurts too. For years, Israelis lived in fear of terror attacks. More recently, the terror attacks have been quelled. Palestinians have been told by their leadership that they are refugees, they have not lived the full lives that they deserve. The local Palestinian governments are linked to terrorists and corruption is rampant. Yet, they are human beings who are living marginlized lives a few short miles away from a thriving First World country. See, it&#8217;s complicated.</p>
<p>And in the end Israel is an important place. It is the most democratic state in the Middle East. But sometimes it can be hard to tell. It can still do better.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah “Thought”) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Lech Lecha</h2>
<h2>Self Improvement</h2>
<p>Parshas Lech Lecha is filled with the lessons of the Jewish experience past, present and future. Each nuance of the parsha is emblazoned with yet another yesod of maassei avos siman labanim and the gift of netzach Yisrael. Moreover, the unique relationship and destiny Klal Yisrael has with Eretz Yisrael is entwined with almost every narrative of this week’s parsha as the first chapter in our legacy of a people is recorded for eternity. No less than four times does Hashem Yisborach promise, commit and reassure Avraham Avinu that Eretz Yisrael is to be his and his children’s forever. Ultimately, Bris Milah solidifies the covenant that the Eibeshter executes with Avraham Avinu and Am Yisrael – Eretz Yisrael is ours forever.</p>
<p>The relationship between the gift of Eretz Yisrael and the covenent of Bris Milah is curious. What is the quid pro quo? <span id="more-3100"></span>A fascinating Sifrei in Parshas Devarim provides an incredible insight.</p>
<p>The Sifrei explains that Hashem Yisborach gave Eretz Yisrael to Avraham (and to Yitzchok and Yaakov) in “as is” condition. The message &#8211; the land of Eretz Yisrael will be what you make of it. The Avos understood this and each of them made improvements to upgrade, embellish and enhance the holy land and our relationship to it. They not only improved the land, they made it personal -Avraham by planting an eishel, Yitzchok as he planted meah shearim and Yaakov when by purchasing Shechem. In so doing they validated the trust Hashem Yisborach placed in them. They not only took what Hashem Yisborach gifted to them, they made it better! This aspect of maasei avos siman labanim is vital for us all. Indeed life is given to us in an “as is” condition – it is up to us to make the necessary improvements through tikkun hamiddos, limud haTorah and maasim tovim.</p>
<p>This too is the essence of the mitzvah of Bris Mila. The Gemara recounts how the Roman general Turnus Rufus once taunted Rabbi Akiva and queried, “What is greater the accomplishments of man or of G-d?” Rabbi Akiva responded, “Man’s accomplishments are superior.” The emperor mocked Rabbi Akiva and pointed to the beauty of nature, the magnificent sky above the horizon, asking, “Can man do this?” Whereupon Rabbi Akiva responded with sheaves of wheat and delicious cakes alongside loaves of bread and retorted “who made the bread and the pastries  – is it not the power of human creativity?” Such is the analogy to Bris Milah, to Eretz Yisrael and even to our everyday life.  Each of us is created in the image of Hashem. We arrive in an “as is” condition and it is up to each individual to perfect himself or herself. We are born with so much opportunity and unbelievable potential but it is up to us actualize it. We must develop ourselves to serve Hashem as He intends. With blood, sweat and tears we can do what it takes to make a difference, to serve as a light to all nations and reveal the hidden truths of Hashem Yisborach’s glory for all to see.</p>
<p>This lesson of self-improvement is part and parcel of the maasei avos siman labanim defined in our parsha. It sets the tone for defining Jewish destiny, and creating a home and family environment with which to rear children into adulthood. Let us make each day better than the last. It is a sacred mission we must live to the fullest.</p>
<p>(Ed. Note: See my podcast <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2008/12/08/connections-12808/">Circumcision and Perfection</a> for more on this topic.)</p>

Jews prayed there for many years. Judaism was (and still is) recognized as an official religion in Lebanon.</p>
<p>During the civil war in Lebanon during the 70&#8217;s through 90&#8217;s most of Lebanon&#8217;s Jews left the country and emigrated to Israel and other Sephardic communities.</p>
<p>In 1982 the Israel Defense Force had reason to suspect that the PLO was hiding weapons inside the synagogue. The IDF bombed the synagogue.</p>
<p>The synagogue lay in ruin for almost 30 years.</p>
<p>The synagogue is now being restored.<span id="more-2839"></span></p>
<p>Soon, Jewish visitors to Beirut will have a place to pray once again.</p>
<p>There are three things that I think are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>First, the official position of Lebanon and Hezbollah is that they are not anti-Jewish, they are anti-Zionist. This is a distinction that gets muddied by Jews and non-Jews alike. It is possible to be a religious Jew and not be in favor of the Israeli Government or even the right of Jews to settle the Land of Israel exclusively. It is also possible for people who dislike Israel&#8217;s Government but still like Jewish people. I think this is an important point.</p>
<p>Second, the restoration of the synagogue is a wonderful gesture of tolerance. Israel and Lebanon fought a war not too long ago. There is still tension between Hezbollah and Israel. However, it is possible that CITIZENS of Israel and CITIZENS of Lebanon can get along. I find the restoring of the synagogue very optimistic and a positive step toward understanding and peace.</p>
<p>Third, Maghen Abraham Synagogue has been compared to Park51 (The center that is being called the Ground Zero Mosque). Some have even called it the Ground Zero Synagogue. I support BOTH projects but I do not think they are quite the same. 3000 civilians died in an unprovoked attack against a financial building. There is no way to twist the Twin Towers into a military target. The synagogue was shelled. It was a military target and no one died. The symbolisms may be similar but it is disingenuous to compare the two. Again, I am in FAVOR of Park51 and Maghen Abraham Synagogue, I just think they are different projects. Park51 is a cultural center with a mosque. It is a building that is supposed to demonstrate moderate Islam. The synagogue will be very utilitarian with no universal message. Again, they are just very different initiatives.</p>
<p>It is my fervent hope that all people will continue to exhibit tolerance and willingness to learn about others. The more we know about one another, the more we will realize that we share much more than we don&#8217;t. Let these two symbols of freedom and tolerance promote more freedom and tolerance across the world.</p>
<p>(Hat Tip: Rabbi Mintz)</p>

<p>Unlike some other bloggers, I have actually read the article, not just the excerpt or the headline.</p>
<p>It is an unfortunate title for an article. Unfortunate because it has set off a firestorm of condemnation and consternation from Israel lovers everywhere. But even more unfortunate because the title is betrayed by the actual article.</p>
<p>The article is not about why Israel doesn&#8217;t care about peace. The article is about why Israeli citizens are not obsessed with peace.</p>
<p>And that is a compliment.</p>
<p>That is a good thing.<span id="more-2820"></span></p>
<p>The article blames the Palestinian leadership for failing to agree to several peace deals. The moderate Palestinians are praised but the article does not express hope that they will survive. The article justifies the &#8220;Wall&#8221; as a necessary security measure and the Gaza Incursion as a necessary military operation. These two controversial moves have borne fruit &#8211; no suicide attacks in over 2 years and until the August 31 shooting that killed 4 people, no deaths of more than 2 people from any attack in over 2 years. In short, Israel has succesfully quashed the insurgance of violence that began with the second intifada.</p>
<p>What has happened as a result of the relative peace in Israel? Israelis have been industrious. They have been working hard and accumulating wealth. They have been inventing things and contributing to the world economy. They have been building families, taking vacations and enjoying life. They have been acting as if they don&#8217;t live in a war-zone because for the last few years they haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The article indicates that Israelis are happy with the way things are. And they should be.</p>
<p>The article assumes that if there were a peace partner that was willing to recognize Israel as a State and provide the same types of freedoms as Israel provides there would be more talk about peace. But as it stands now, Palestinians are led by politicians who don&#8217;t want to negotiate with Israel seriously and since the violence is under control, there is no reason to discuss anything.</p>
<p>The article concludes the Palestinian issue by saying that Palestinians need to make themselves heard again. How? With violence? Absolutely not. By giving a voice to the moderates who want to talk to Israel. Who can argue with that?</p>
<p>There is no mention of a &#8220;Humanitarian Crisis&#8221; in Gaza. There is no mention of &#8220;War Crimes&#8221;. There is no mention of &#8220;Disproportionate Response&#8221;. No mention of &#8220;Illegal Settlements&#8221;. The article is favorable to Israel. No question about it.</p>
<p>I have two and a half minor gripes with the article.</p>
<p>1) The article kind of glosses over the rocket attacks. Those are not negligible and the fear of attack is worth noting.</p>
<p>2) The article says almost no Palestinians are allowed into Israel. As far as I know that is inaccurate.</p>
<p>3) (only half a gripe) The title is provocative &#8211; but then again, headlines are meant to grab attention. This one grabbed everyone&#8217;s attention. So maybe it was a good title.</p>
<p>But I have two major gripes with Israel friends who lambasted the article.</p>
<p>1) I always hear from Zionist friends that &#8220;It is so good here&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s more dangerous in America&#8221;, &#8220;The economy is booming&#8221;, &#8220;Israel is a Western State&#8221;, etc. And now, Time Magazine is reporting that yes, Israel is in fact a peaceful, productive place and somehow that is not allowed?! Talk about &#8220;Double Standard&#8221;.</p>
<p>2) People should just read the darn thing before complaining about it! There are times where Israel is treated poorly in the court of popular opinion. This is NOT one of those times! We lose credibility if we cry &#8220;Wolf&#8221; any time we can sniff a trace of anti-Israel sentiment. Here, you&#8217;ll need to sniff extra hard.</p>

<p>I really like the Museum of Tolerance. The overall message of the museum is a message that I wholeheartedly agree with.</p>
<p>Tolerance is a very important value in my worldview and the museum does a super job teaching that message.</p>
<p>(For a more complete review of the museum read my previous post <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/12/my-visit-to-the-museum-of-tolerance-at-the-simon-wiesenthal-center/">My Visit to the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center</a>.)</p>
<p>There was one thing I noticed, or rather, did not notice that I find necessary to question and perhaps even criticize.</p>
<p><span id="more-2623"></span></p>
<p>For all the talk and exhibits representing the horrors of racism, prejudice and segregation there was something missing. I could not help but imagine myself as a (hypothetical) average liberal, civil rights activist visiting the museum.</p>
<p>I am sure I would be impressed with the exhibits and their message. There is a possible segregation issue in one region of the world that is intimately related to the MOT. In fact this area is mentioned in various museum exhibits. Yet nowhere is the important civil rights issue mentioned or explored.</p>
<p>The region is the Middle East and specifically I am referring to Israel.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, there is a level of segregation on Israel. There is a more privileged class and a less privileged class. The Jewish Israelis are the privileged class. They control the policies and laws of the country. The less privileged class are the Arab Muslims in general and in particular the Palestinians living in Gaza.</p>
<p>There is a wall (depicted rather satirically in the photo above) that separates Israelis from Palestinians. There are laws that prevent some services and benefits from Gaza.  In essence there is a level of segregation.</p>
<p>Of course, supporters of Israel explain that these measures are not segregation &#8211; they are protection. They will explain that these policies are justified. That may be true. But on its face, the situation certainly has an appearance of intolerance or racism.</p>
<p>I wish the Museum of Tolerance would have dealt with this issue. It should be presented and rebutted to the best of their ability. If it cannot be rebutted the museum should not be ashamed to admit that. Its omitance seems problematic to me.</p>
<p>The issue is in fact at the forefront of many humanitarian groups. The UN takes it very seriously as well. I would have loved to see a well reasoned, clearly articulated, intelligent response.</p>
<p>Instead I got nothing.</p>
<p>I like the museum a lot. On this issue they can do better. A lot better.</p>

<p><em><span style="color: #808080;">What follows is my understanding of The Oral Law and its transmission to us. This article does not attempt to validate or prove its transmission as fact, rather it explains just what is being transmitted when we refer to Torah SheBaal Peh (TSBP).</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #808080;">I am sure there are plenty of maamarei Chazal that are not 100% congruent with this approach. I am also sure that there are many maamarei Chazal that do jive with this approach. I have spent many hours studying and analyzing the concept of TSBP and what follows is what I believe to be a rational, coherent, non-apologetic approach.<span id="more-1108"></span><br />
</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #808080;">Much of this essay is accessible<span style="color: #808080;"> in </span><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/18/structure-and-philosophy-of-torah-3-connections-5409/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #808080;">audio format by clicking here</span></a><span style="color: #808080;">.</span></span></em></p>
<p>The Torah preceded the world. One tradition tell us that God looked into the Torah and created the world. That means that the Torah contains within it the spiritual genetic code of the world and the world is a physical manifestation of that code. Another metaphor would be a blueprint. All the information necessary to build is in the blueprint, yet it is merely ink and paper. What can this mean? God looked at the stories of Adam and Eve and created the world? Or God looked at the sale of Joseph and created the word? Impossible. The metaphor does not even make sense. I believe Chazal are telling us that Torah is not the stories or even laws in the Chumash. &#8220;Torah&#8221; refers to the all encompassing Oral Law (this idea is attributed to Rambam). In other words, the Oral Law refers to the natural and supernatural rules of the universe that manifested themselves in a physical sense once God put them into motion during &#8220;Creation&#8221;.</p>
<p>What this means is that the Torah and our universe are really two sides of one coin. The spiritual code on one side and the physical manifestation on the other side. Thus, someone could potentially rewrite the spiritual code by examining the physical manifestation side. Just as with a blueprint, a talented architect could possibly rewrite a blueprint by examining a building a talented spiritualist would be capable of figuring out the spiritual code the world is made of.</p>
<p>This spiritual code contains within it the natural rules of our universe and some of those rules are recommended limitations on human activity designed to help a person maximize their existence in the world. In this light, the Torah is a guide that gives the physical world its characteristics and contains the instructions for living in that world.</p>
<p>A few individuals were in tune with this reality and implemented some of the Torah&#8217;s concepts into their lives. Shem, Ever, Noach and Enosh were a few of the first people who were able to glean spiritual rules from their observations of the world.</p>
<p>Abraham was the first to grasp enough of the code for God to choose him to begin a nation of people to whom God would eventually charge with keeping and teaching this code. Slowly, Abraham taught these concepts to whomever would listen. The Abrahamic family was also aware of these Torah rules and whether they kept them or not is not relevant. They knew them and may have practiced them.</p>
<p>Upon Abraham&#8217;s family being enslaved in Egypt, the concepts and their rules became more and more forgotten. The exodus occurred just before the point of no return. The point that Chazal call the 49th level of impurity. The slaves were just as Egyptian as their slave-masters save for 3 (or 4) areas. Such, a large nation of people would need a guide book to remind them of their Abrahamic, monotheistic, Torah tradition. The Bnei Yisrael left Egypt for the sole purpose of receiving these instructions in the form of the Torah.</p>
<p>At Sinai, God gave Moses the entire code. This code included the spiritual rules, the laws, the stories (which all contain important moral and quasi-historical lessons) as well as all the information necessary to live according to those laws. God then gave Moses a written version of notes to this code. These notes were the bare minimum necessary to reconstruct the entire code as God gave it to Moses.</p>
<p>At this point, Moses has all the information in his head and gives the people this written book of notes that we call the Written Law or Torah SheBiksav (TSBK). As time progresses Moses added (probably divinely inspired) notes to the end of the TSBK to complete the books. The Jewish people try to live a lifestyle as Moses taught them according to the code and had the notes in TSBK to help them remember their obligations. As we are taught at the start of Ethics of our Fathers, Moses &#8220;kibbel&#8221; (received) the &#8220;Torah&#8221; (including the TSBP) (and again this does not mean the Chumash, why would there need to be a mesora for that if it was written) and gave it all to Joshua, who gave it to the elders etc. There was a central Torah authority who could resolve disputes. Originally, it was a one man show starring Moses. But at the behest of Jethro, some delegation gave Torah authority to others. There was no machlokes (disagreement) among the Torah authority as Moses could always be consulted to give them the truth.</p>
<p>The system was designed to ensure that there would be a transmission from parent to child and teacher to student. This guaranteed the Torah would remain a &#8220;living&#8221; Torah and not relegated to a library. Codifying the bare minimum in text form forced the Jewish people to rely on a system of relationships and living the life of Torah to remember all its laws. This is an integral part of the Oral Transmission that has stood the test of time, as we shall see.</p>
<p>This system remained in place throughout the 1st Temple. A central Torah authority was the final arbiter of disputes and there was no machlokes as to what Moses claimed God wanted the Jewish people to do in their service of God.</p>
<p>Many called this entire concept into question. Korach, Yeravam and others wished to undermine the Mosaic Torah authority. But it always existed.</p>
<p>During the Second Temple, due to oppression it was literally impossible to maintain a central Torah authority. Torah study was banned, Torah scholars were killed and Yeshivas were disbanded. Students began taking notes to ensure TSBP would be remembered.</p>
<p>In a revolutionary move, Rabbi Yehuda HaNassi collected many of these notebooks and canonized a version of TSBP notes called the Mishna. He too, followed the Mosaic formula of writing just the bare minimum necessary for a scholar to recreate the code from the Mishna. He wrote the Mishnayos in a format that would induce questions and those questions would in turn produce the TSBP tradition. He was successful to an extent. But due to the increased hostility and lack of central Torah authority disputes were common. R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi completely succeeded in the broader goal of maintaining the need for the parent to child, teacher to student relationship to transmit TSBP.</p>
<p>Mishnaic literature was discussed, argued and taught for a couple hundred years. Students continued taking notes and eventually these notes became the Talmud. Ravina and Rav Ashi collected these notes and recorded these conversations to canonize the understanding of the Mishna in order to recreate the entire code. Although to a lesser degree, they also made an effort to be concise and include only the discussion necessary for recreating the method of Jewish life briefly described in the Mishna that was based on the written notes of the Chumash that God gave to Moses. Their brevity, once again maintained the familiar generation to generation connection that TSBP demands.</p>
<p>Since the closing of the Talmud it has been discussed and argued vociferously. This is a good thing. It gives its scholars the chance they need to arrive at the truth. TSBP is not their discussions, it is what they are discussing. TSBP was given to the Jewish people at Sinai but in truth it exists all around us. It is the rules of nature and spirituality that govern our world. Distant cultures and tribes can come to similar conclusions as the Torah because they are examining the world that is the physical manifestation of that Torah. People who never heard of Torah can relate to many of its laws as they seem natural to them. In fact they are natural to the world.</p>
<p>In conclusion, when we say that Moses received Torah SheBaal Peh, what we mean is that Moses had all the information necessary to live and appreciate the Torah lifestyle. The Written Torah were the original notes to this information as time progresses, we now have Mishanic and Talmudic notes as well. Thus, our study of Talmud today continues the Oral Transmission of TSBP as we attempt to decode the original version of the Oral Law handed from God to Moses on Sinai. Today, our greatest resource to that end is the study of Talmud.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago I was a campus Rabbi for the <a href="http://jamoncampus.com/" target="_blank">Jewish Awareness Movement </a>at <a href="http://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC</a>. One of my primary responsibilities was to lead large groups of Jewish college students on inspiring trips to Israel.</p>
<p>Of course, the personal inspiration for me, was very often, greater than the inspiration for some of the students.</p>
<p>One episode has inspired me since the moment it occurred and it is directly related to today&#8217;s Tisha B&#8217;Av fast.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span>We always were sure to take the students on the <a href="http://english.thekotel.org/content.asp?id=116" target="_blank">Tunnel Tours of the Western Wall</a>. For me, it was incredible to see the beauty and grandeur of the gigantic white stones at the original base of the Western Wall. The Talmud in Sukkah tells of the beauty of the Second Temple that Herod rebuilt. It is hard to imagine such beauty when we see the above ground Western Wall today. Erosion and time have taken its physical beauty. But underground the stones are a pristine white and appear good as new.</p>
<p>Our tour guide was always the world renowned Esther Schlisser (who has since passed May Her Memory Be Blessed). Esther Schlisser was a one of a kind woman who took these tours very seriously. She allowed no talking, no photographs of her and she brazenly single-handedly led us through the Arab Quarter at the end of the tour during the second intifada.</p>
<p>We began the tour sitting in front of a really cool model of Herod&#8217;s Second Temple and with the magic of technology it transforms into the current Old City layout. The route of the tour took us deep down to the lower Western Wall base stones and along the Wall below the Arab Quarter. What we see of the Wall today, is a fraction of the size of the original Wall.</p>
<p>We finally arrived at my favorite spot. There is a section of floor from the Second Temple era that has been excavated and this is where Esther had us all sit on floor. I really enjoy touching history, and walking and sitting on the floor where our grandparents sat 2000 years ago is very powerful for me.</p>
<p>Esther then begins to tell us where we are sitting and the great men who must have walked these same cobble stones. She then begins to cry. Esther tells us the following (paraphrased to the best of memory):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;These stones are alive!</em></p>
<p><em>My husband died many years ago. When he died I was sad. I cried for days, for months, but eventually, I began to heal and I no longer cry for my husband. This is because my husband is dead and we cannot cry over something that is dead forever. I miss him terribly, but I do not cry.</em></p>
<p><em>However, I come to this spot, the floor right in front of the Western Wall of the Second Temple at least once a day for the past 10 years. Every single time I come here, I cry. I cry that we are exiled and that we cannot see the Temple in its true grandeur and I cry that we are at the mercy of the nations of the world and we cannot rule ourselves as per the Torah&#8217;s command. Jews have been crying here for centuries. We will continue to cry until we are redeemed from this exile.</em></p>
<p><em>There is only one way to explain this. The stones are alive. The Wall is alive. There is a soul in the bricks that lives. Its voice is small, it is weak, but it is alive and that is how we can cry centuries of tears for a destroyed Temple. The Temple may have been destroyed but still, it lives.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A very powerful experience and one I think of very often.</p>
<p>On this Tisha B&#8217;Av, remember that we are not crying over a dead Temple. If it were so, we would have stopped crying eons ago. The stones are alive. They are kept alive by the promise that we will see a Third Temple. They are kept alive by the souls of the Jewish people yearning for their Temple to be rebuild. And they are kept alive by the tears we cry on Tisha B&#8217;Av every single year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning I found <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-06-16/the-hidden-jews/full/" target="_blank">this article</a> in my inbox. From time to time, <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">PJC</a> board member, <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/juddmag" target="_blank">Judd Magilnick</a> sends me (and everyone else he knows) interesting links from all around the web, stretching to the outer limits of the blogosphere and conventional media.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s link covers something that is always on my mind.<span id="more-796"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-06-16/the-hidden-jews/full/" target="_blank">The column</a> discusses the latest research in DNA testing to identify if one is Jewish. There is a gene that is only passed from the mother to the child and it can be tested using a cheek swab DNA test.</p>
<p>Jewish roots are cropping up in the least likely of places. Al Qaeda spokesmen, Catholic Priests, a former Buddhist Catholic Radio Host to name a few. Historically, Fidel Castro, Madeleine Albright also claimed Jewish ancestry.</p>
<p>Now, it is testable.</p>
<p>DNA testing makes it possible to identify your Jewish gene as well.</p>
<p>What is fascinating to me is the idea that we are all related and it is scientifically &#8220;trackable&#8221;. The first time I went to Israel as a teen I experienced a profound feeling. I felt like I was among family. Everywhere I went was family. Every person I saw was a relative. I have always felt this way and in Israel it was an elevated sense of consciousness.</p>
<p>When I worked at <a href="http://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a> for <a href="http://jamoncampus.com/" target="_blank">Ashreinu</a> I felt it every time I met another Jewish student.</p>
<p>Now, at the <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a>, and especially when we are at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;q=505+Ocean+Front+Walk,+Venice,+Los+Angeles,+California+90291&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=1&amp;geocode=Ff2xBgIdAijw-A&amp;split=0&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=23.875,57.630033&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A" target="_blank">Shul on the Beach</a>, I feel it whenever <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/15/outreach-on-the-beach-61409/" target="_blank">someone new wanders in to our Shul</a>.</p>
<p>Frequently, I remark to fellow Jews the first time we meet, &#8220;We&#8217;re cousins ya know! We&#8217;re all cousins.&#8221; I don&#8217;t need DNA tests to prove it to me. I can feel it.</p>
<p>Taken to the next level. Not only are all Jewish people one family. The entire human race is one family. Yes, we have our disagreements about things, but in the end we are all family.</p>
<p>I think this is a powerful idea. I think we should consider this when hate creeps into our minds. I think we should teach this to our children. I think the more we see our similarities in one another the more peaceful our world will be.</p>
<p>Just last week <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/16/what-is-the-appropriate-reaction/" target="_blank">I blogged about a tragedy that happened to one of our &#8220;closer relative</a><a href="http://rabbifink.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/what-is-the-appropriate-reaction/" target="_blank">s&#8221;</a>. I think a lot of us felt strongly about the issue raised then because we innately feel that this happened to family. This is a fair reaction.</p>
<p>We must treat our &#8220;closer family&#8221; like the closer family that we are. But we must also not lose sight of our broader family. The entire world is family, because &#8220;we are all related&#8221;.</p>

<p>For many people Israel serves as a bastion of democracy in the Middle East, for others it is a Jewish homeland where no Jew will be denied access, for others it holds tremendous historical value, there are others who cherish its spiritual significance and there are yet others who pine for the elevated Torah study of the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>Our goal was to find the meaning of the Land of Israel and its connection to the Jewish people from the Torah. We went to the source to find why there is an intrinsic connection between the Jewish people and the land of Israel.</p>
<p>This relationship did not begin in <a href="http://www.wzo.org.il/en/resources/view.asp?id=1040" target="_blank">1948</a>.</p>
<p>The class ended with some really interesting anecdotes (I don&#8217;t want to give anything away &#8211; but suffice to say, very interesting stuff) and a few great points from our Connections attendees.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Normally I don&#8217;t like to tread the dangerous waters of politics. That is why you find no commentary on the current skirmish in Gaza. However I feel it necessary to mention that our thoughts and prayers are with Dov Dalin &#8211; Dov Chaim ben Masha Chana. Dov is the son of community members Gary and Marsha Dalin. He is a reserve in the Israel Defense Force and serves as a sniper in the paratroopers. He is currently being deployed to Gaza. We pray for his safe return and the success of his mission.</p>
<p>A war is on the news and in the papers &#8211; we don&#8217;t necessarily feel it. When we know someone fighting in the war &#8211; we feel it. Right now &#8211; I feel it.</p>
<p>Bracha V&#8217;Hatzlacha Dov!</p>
