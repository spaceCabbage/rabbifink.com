<p>When the proposal reached the Litchfield planning board the center was denied.</p>
<p>The reasons cited by the board were mostly aesthetic. &#8220;The doors will be too big&#8221;, &#8220;The building will be a monstrosity compared to our small quaint homes&#8221;, &#8220;The Star of David may not comply with the historic district&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>Fueling the tensions are claims that the opposition to the center is anti-Semitic.<span id="more-2854"></span></p>
<p>Without drawing comparisons to Park51 (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/18/ground-zero-mosque-vs-downtown-manhattan-islamic-cultural-center-video-debate/">Ground Zero Mosque vs. Downtown Manhattan Islamic Cultural Center: Video Debate</a>) or the Maghen Abraham Synagogue in Lebanon (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/15/maghen-abraham-synagogue-in-beirut-lebanon-a-symbol-of-tolerance/">Maghen Abraham Synagogue in Beirut Lebanon: A Symbol of Tolerance</a>), the issues raised in the spat are issues that go to the heart of religion in America.</p>
<p>In America, Religion is tolerated. In America, if yours is not the dominant religion, please keep to yourselves and don&#8217;t impose on the rest of us. In America, religion is okay so long as it is not &#8220;in my face&#8221;.</p>
<p>But for the dominant religion? In your face is totally fine. Prayers before sporting events, political policy in the name of &#8220;religion&#8221; and even laws that are rooted in a very specific Christian understanding of the bible are all part and parcel of the &#8220;American Experience&#8221;.</p>
<p>My opinion: Less &#8220;In Your Face&#8221; Religion from everyone would be quite welcome. Christopher Hitchens talks about the modernization of religion. This is vital to living in a world with more than one acceptanle viewpoint and especially when a competing viewpoint is right around the virtual corner. Religion can no longer be bully, it needs to place nice with the global community and respect all traditions and religions, even those who have neither.</p>
<p>I am no fan of blocking a Synagogue. Especially if and when it is fueled by anti-Semitism, but if it were me building the synagogue, I would try to fit into the aesthetic character of the community as best as I possibly could and be as unobtrusive as possible.</p>
<p>So, I choose neither side in this battle&#8230;</p>

<p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger is quitting the over-the-air radio business. She has been forced into a corner with no apparent way out. Her resigning was demanded in the wake of her comments to a caller in which she used racial slurs to illustrate a point.</p>
<p>I am not defending Dr. Laura&#8217;s use of insensitive language, however I do not think she should quit or be asked / forced to quit.</p>
<p>Here is exactly what happened: (<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/opinions/view/opinion/In-Defense-of-Dr-Laura-4741" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>A black woman called the show and told Dr. Laura that</p>
<blockquote><p>her husband is white and his relatives frequently use hurtful racial language around her, including the &#8220;N-word.&#8221; In response, Schlessinger said &#8220;Black guys use it all the time. Turn on HBO, listen to a black comic, and all you hear is n*****, n*****, n*****.&#8221; Schlessinger also told her that &#8220;If you&#8217;re that hypersensitive about color and don&#8217;t have a sense of humor, don&#8217;t marry out of your race.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Predictably, there was a lot of backlash and Dr. Laura was forced to quit.<span id="more-2727"></span></p>
<p>The Dr. Laura flap reminded me of the Helen Thomas fiasco. Thomas was also forced to resign in the wake of her insensitive comments as well.</p>
<p>Thomas said something to effect of:</p>
<blockquote><p>Israelis should &#8220;get the hell out of Palestine&#8221; and &#8220;go home&#8221; to Germany and Poland.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thomas took the heat for a few days until she quit.</p>
<p>I think these stories are both tragic.</p>
<p>Yes, in both cases, the comments were insensitive. Would they like to take back their words if they could? Sure. So why don&#8217;t we let them?</p>
<p>Both of these women speak millions of words over the course of their careers. It is inevitable that they will slip up. Why are we so swift to demand they give up their careers? Have we become so sensitive that there is no longer forgiveness?</p>
<p>It goes to a deeper issue as well.</p>
<p>The distillation of thought and narrowing of acceptable speech severely hampers the ability for Americans to debate and discuss issues. The 1st Amendment protects our right to free speech. This right has been described as providing a marketplace of ideas. If we allow whoever yells loudest to bully the marketplace then the marketplace becomes dominated by that voice.</p>
<p>The proper response to speech that you find offensive is not deprive the speaker from speaking further.* It is by explaining why the speech is offensive and offering counter-speech. Discussion and debate. Not calls for resigning.</p>
<p>By allowing bullies to determine who is permitted in the marketplace if ideas and who is not permitted in the marketplace of ideas curtails the effectiveness of that marketplace.</p>
<p>Dr. Laura and Helen Thomas were important voices. They may be infuriating at times and they may have been insensitive. But that is not a reason for their voices to be lost. The marketplace of ideas has fewer voices and that hurts us.</p>
<p>The real losers in their resignations is us.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">*Severe forms of hate speech that are likely to incite violence or compromise the rights of others are not protected by the 1st Amendment.</span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The MTA has approved a pretty powerful anti-Cordoba Center ad.</p>
<p>Here is the ad:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Controversial-Ground-Zero-Mosque-Ads.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2708" title="Controversial-Ground-Zero-Mosque-Ads" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Controversial-Ground-Zero-Mosque-Ads.jpg?resize=638%2C137" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I find the ad obscene. It is provocative, misleading and presumptuous all in one.</p>
<p>However, as much as the ICC has a right to exist, this ad has a right to exist as well. The same laws that protect the ICC, protect this obscene ad. (Note: If the ad was so incendiary as to cause violence it would NOT be protected by the constitution, in which case it would lose my meaningless approval as well)</p>
<p>The irony is that the folks behind the ad can hide behind the 1st Amendment but would deny the same rights to the Cordoba Center.</p>
