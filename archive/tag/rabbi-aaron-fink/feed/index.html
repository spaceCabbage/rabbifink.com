				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rav Yaakov Weinberg was a part of my life for as long as I can remember. My father, like any true talmid of Rav Weinberg, quoted his rebbe often and with regard to a wide range of issues. His intellectualism and broadminded approach to Orthodox Judaism are my father&#8217;s guiding light professionally and personally. His wisdom in Torah and secular knowledge was only bested by his thirst for more knowledge. Thus, the Torah and methodology of Rav Weinberg were always part of our home.</p>
<p>I also have early memories of meeting the Rosh Yeshiva and I was always struck by his warmth and infinite smile. Those early times that I met him, he was just a very sweet man to my young mind, not an anti-social intellectual. As I grew older and learned more about this great man, I realized that his greatness was not limited to his intellectual prowess and dedication to truth. Those were ever present. Rav Weinberg&#8217;s greatness was his Ahavas Yisrael.<span id="more-8626"></span></p>
<p>The care and concern he had for his close students and the students of the yeshiva in general was legendary. When we lived in Buffalo, NY, my father was the Headmaster of Kadimah Jewish Day School. Seeking advice on a nerve wracking board vote, my father called Rav Weinberg. As usual, Rav Weinberg&#8217;s voice and wisdom were very helpful to my father. The next morning, my father received a phone call from Rav Weinberg. His rebbe called to say that he was at Buffalo Niagara International Airport and he asked if it would be possible for him to be picked up. My father incredulously asked what his rebbe was doing in Buffalo. Rav Weinberg replied, &#8220;I heard in your voice that you needed some chizuk so I came to see my talmid. I hope you can show me around the school.&#8221;<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8627" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/2012070613416054739241.jpg?w=980" alt="2012070613416054739241" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>His love and devotion to perfect strangers and non-Orthodox Jews was exemplary. Rav Weinberg had regular phone meetings with non-Orthodox &#8220;friends&#8221; he had met in his travels. He gave lectures in cities and towns where the primary audience was non-Orthodox. We don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s strange because we are accustomed to these stories about Rav Weinberg by now, but has there ever been a charedi Rosh Yeshiva of Rav Weinberg&#8217;s caliber who spent so much time with non-Orthodox Jews? I don&#8217;t think so. But it was his obvious love for everyone that made his commitment to so many different people and groups so unsurprising.</p>
<p>Rav Weinberg&#8217;s daughter, Dr. Aviva Weisbord, <a href="http://www.wherewhatwhenarchives.com/2009/07/rosh-hayeshiva-rabbi-shmuel-yaakov-weinberg-ztl-on-his-tenth-yahrzeit/" target="_blank">shared an anecdote</a> that demonstrates Rav Weinberg&#8217;s incredibly positive approach to how we relate to God.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;More than the genius, greater than the encyclopedic knowledge, beyond the prodigious output of original thought, there was the love: the all-encompassing, totally accepting, completely non-judgmental love for us and for every single Jew. It was a love that could give us a sense of what Hashem’s love is like for His children, so to speak. One erev Rosh Hashanah, my sister called my father to express her fears of the Day of Judgment. He asked her, “Do you know I love you?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” she answered.</p>
<p>“And if you did the absolutely worst thing possible, would you still know I love you?”</p>
<p>“One hundred percent.”</p>
<p>“Then listen carefully: Hashem loves you a billion times more. Don’t be afraid of Him: turn to Him.”</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see how one who really feels that God loves every one of God&#8217;s children will love all of those people. This was the never-ending wellspring of love from with Rav Weinberg drank. God&#8217;s love for us is infinite. We, in turn, love all of God&#8217;s children.</p>
<p>And this too is manifest in the work of many Rav Weinberg&#8217;s talmidim. I know that it is the mantra of my father&#8217;s school. As expressed in his school, God&#8217;s love for each us is so great because we are all God&#8217;s children and we are all capable of individual greatness in God&#8217;s image. We are all unique and we all have something to contribute that cannot be replicated by anyone else. God loves each of us and wants us to succeed. It&#8217;s the opposite of the angry, vengeful, scary God that pervades too much of our educational system.</p>
<p>On this 15th yartzeit, I humbly suggest we adopt this version of our relationship with God. Teach this to your children, students, and congregants. Teach Rav Weinberg&#8217;s way &#8211; intellectualism and sophistication with an overdose of love and tenderness.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</address>
<h2>Parshas Vayechi<br />
Golus Gold is Fool&#8217;s Gold</h2>
<p>Each year at this time we read of Bnai Yisrael’s impending golus. Each event from the sale of Yosef into Mitzrayim until Yaakov Avinu’s arrival and subsequent death in Egypt is a pattern of history which we have, sadly, followed all too often. One interesting attitude regarding <i>golus</i> and all of its impact is thrice repeated by Chazal and found in Parshas Vayigash, Vayechi, as well as, in Sefer Shmos. Its implicit message is profound</p>
<p>Following Yaakov Avinu’s <i>petirah</i> Yosef tells Pharaoh that he must bury his father (Yaakov) in Eretz Yisrael. Indeed, Yosef explains to the Egyptian monarch, that his father, Yaakov, made him swear (50:5) that he would bury him (Yaakov) in the grave “<em>asher karisi li b’Eretz Canaan</em>.” Chazal are puzzled by this unusual term of “<em>karisi li</em>” and offer many explanations as to its meaning. Amongst a number of <i>pshatim</i>, Rashi quotes one <i>man d’amar</i> which explains that Yaakov informed Yosef that he had purchased the right to be buried in <em>Me’aras Hamachpaila</em> from his brother Eisav. Sometime after his return to Eretz Yisrael, Yaakov took all the money he earned in the house of Lavan and gave it to Eisav as payment. Yaakov wanted to be sure there would be no argument after his death regarding the rights to this coveted burial plot. He paid for it just to be sure.</p>
<p>However there is an important detail in these words of Chazal which cannot be overlooked.<span id="more-6718"></span> The Midrash says that the money he used to purchase his burial plot came form the assets he accumulated while working in Lavan’s home. In parshas Vayigash, this Midrash is at the heart of a vital <i>yesod</i> taught to us in Rashi. The posuk (46:6) states <i>vayikchu es mikneihem v’es richusham asher rachashi b’eretz Canaan vayavoa Mitzrayma</i>. Rashi wonders what are we to learn from the fact that the <i>posuk</i> specifically states that Yaakov and his sons took they assets they acquired in Eretz Canaan with them to Egypt. On the spot, Rashi quotes the aforementioned Midrash and adds a twist. He says that Yaakov Avinu declared “<i>nichasei chutz laAretz einan kidai li</i>!” The assets I amassed in <i>golus</i> are inappropriate for me. Only the monies I acquired while in Eretz Yisrael have real value! As such, Yaakov gave all the money he earned in the house of Lavan to Eisav in order to guarantee the right of burial in <i>Me’aras Hamachpeilah</i>. Only the assets earned in Eretz Yisrael were brought down with his family to Mitzrayim.</p>
<p>This message cannot be overlooked. Yaakov Avinu, the one who risked his life in Parshas Vayishlach for <i>pachim ktanim</i> – small jars, wanted to take nothing from the Golus with him. Better to give it away. Indeed, only the assets of Eretz Yisrael, our true home, our spiritual <i>makkor</i>, should accompany us in the sojourn of exile. The resources and material acquired <i>chutz laAretz</i> are temporary at best and they are tainted with <i>golus</i> fever which can infect our value system at anytime.</p>
<p><i>Maasei avos siman labanim. </i>This attitude towards golus-gold is eternal. Material wealth amassed in the Diaspora is ephemeral and we must view it that way. To do otherwise places us at risk of becoming a prisoner to its lustful attraction. Real money and real value is that which we accomplish in Eretz Yisrael. Chazal are guiding us to understand that Yaakov Avinu wanted us to learn a lesson before heading down to Mitzrayim.  Golus-gold is fools gold, it may acquire things, even good things such as a burial plot in <i>mearas hamachpeila</i>, but ultimately it has no intrinsic value. We cannot take it with us nor should we. We who are so desperate for <i>geula</i> must make this attitude real. It must pulsate through all of our <i>golus</i> endeavors. Indeed, internalizing this mantra is the first ingredient in being able to proudly answer the question of <i>tzipisem</i> <i>liyishua</i> correctly.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Learn With Your Children</h2>
<p>After Yosef reveals himself to his brothers he sends them home to tell their father that he is still alive and to please come join him in Mitzrayim. The brothers hasten to their father and exclaim <i>od Yosef chai vchi hu mosheil b’chol Eretz Mitzrayim </i>&#8211; Yosef still lives and he is the ruler over all of Egypt. The Torah continues, <i>vayafag libo ki lo he&#8217;emin lahem </i>&#8211; Yakov&#8217;s heart fluttered because he did not believe them. However, when the brothers continued to tell their story, and Yakov saw the <i>agalos &#8211; </i>the wagons that Yosef sent to carry him down to Egypt the Pasuk tells us: <i>vat’chi ruach Yaakov Avihem </i>– Yaakov’s spirit was revived and invigorated. He was so much <i>b’simcha</i> that he was even ready for <i>nevuah</i>.</p>
<p>One cannot help but wonder, why didn’t Yaakov believe the <em>Shevatim</em> from the moment they reported the momentous news of Yosef’s survival? And why did the <i>agalos</i> revive Yaakov’s spirit?<span id="more-6659"></span> Lev Eliyahu explains that Yakov Avinu, upon hearing the declaration of his 11 sons – including Binyamin, had no doubt that Yosef was physically alive. What he could not believe was that <i>od Yosef </i><b><i>Chai</i></b>&#8211; that the spiritual essence of Yosef <b><i>Hatzadik</i></b> had survived after so many years away from his father and his family. Could the leader of Egypt be a frum Jew? Couldn’t be, thought Yaakov Avinu. After all, one cannot ascend to such a powerful position without a compromise of religious values and practice. Though he was happy to hear the news that Yosef was still physically alive, <i>vayafeg libo</i> Yaakov’s felt faint. He now feared not the loss of Yosef but of Yosef <i>Hatzadik!</i> His soul shuddered at the thought that his righteous son had been corrupted by the depravity of Egyptian society. The brothers tried to convince Yakov otherwise, but Yakov would not accept it. To Yakov it was impossible—until he saw the wagons that Yosef sent for him.</p>
<p>Chazal tell us that Yosef sent <i>Agalos</i> to hint to his father of the topic they had been studying 22 years earlier, the laws of <i>Egla Arufa</i>. Yosef anticipated his father&#8217;s concern and knew that if he could demonstrate to his father that he was still immersed in Torah, his father wouldn&#8217;t be disappointed, nor would he suspect that Yosef had <i>chas v’shalom</i> deviated from the Torah&#8217;s way. Indeed, as a result, <i>vat’chi ruach Yaakov Avihem</i>. Yaakov’s spirit was rejuvinated.</p>
<p>We learn from this a powerful message of how one should never underestimate nor diminish the importance of parents and children learning together. Even after twenty-two years it was the bond of Talmud Torah between father and son that gave life meaning to both Yakov and Yosef. It is a bond that lasts forever and it is never too late to start!</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayetze<br />
The Ropes That Pull Us Together</h2>
<p>As we begin to see the emergence of Yaakov Avinu as the father of the <em>shivtei ka </em>we cannot help but notice the many nuanced messages and symbolism the Torah shares with us. One such <em>yesod</em> is found in the encounter of Yitzchok Avinu at the famous well outside of Charan.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that Yaakov Avinu arrived at Charan after his harrowing journey in flight from his brother. As he arrived he finds himself at the <em>be’er basadeh</em>. There the famous tale of his encounter with Rochel Imeinu is recorded. Chazal wonder what is to be learned from the fact that it is a <em>be’er basadeh</em>, a well in the field, which defines Yaakov Avinu’s arrival into <em>golus</em>.</p>
<p>Midrashim are filled with symbolic messages explaining the representations of this <em>be’er</em>, the <em>edrei tzon</em> and the large stone which sealed and provided access to the water source of the community. The Malbim provides us a most meaningful <em>mehalach </em>so relevant to us today.<span id="more-6505"></span></p>
<p>In his approach the Malbim explains that the<em> be’er </em>represents the <em>mekor mayim chayim</em>. It reflects the<em> hashpaas</em> Hashem, His goodness and bountiful blessings that give us the proverbial hug from the Borei Olam. In a word, the Be’er represents the Shechina and how it fills our lives with all of His blessings. The symbolism is powerful.</p>
<p>The Malbim points out that as Yaakov was now in <em>golus</em> the Shechina came with him, indeed the <em>be’er</em> was <em>basadeh</em>, in the field outside of Eretz Yisrael. However, when Klal Yisrael is living in their homeland with the close access to the Shechina the Bais Hamikdash provides we will find the <em>be’er bisoch ha’er</em>, in the very heart of the city. Nevertheless, while residing in <em>golus </em>it is our vital task to bring that <em>be’er</em> and the spiritual nourishment it represents from the <em>sadeh</em> into our home.</p>
<p>Just how does one bring the sanctity and warmth of the <em>be’er</em> into their home? The Malbim again draws on the words of Chazal and teaches that Reb Yehoshua taught his students that the way to harness the power of the <em>be’er</em> and pull it from the <em>sadeh</em> into the city is by fashioning <em>chavalim min hasubim</em> and through that be <em>machzeer Shechinaso leTziyon</em>. Strands braided from the leftover and unwanted fibers can be spun and twisted into powerful ropes, attached to the well and used to <em>shlep</em> it into the heart of the city. The ropes the Malbim describes represent the spinning and twisting together of Klal Yisrael from many fragments (even discarded ones) into one cord of strength as Yidden from all walks of life come together to accomplish the seemingly impossible.</p>
<p>The message is clear. If we want to bring the Shechina into our city, our community and our home we need strong ropes of <em>achdus</em> to pull together and bring the <em>be’er </em>closer and provide us the spiritual refreshment the <em>hashpaas haShechina </em>bestows. Only through <em>achdus</em> can we truly fare well.</p>
<p>This is no small feat.</p>
<p>Too often we stand apart rather then building on what we have in common. However, we must find a way to wrap ourselves around our common heartfelt <em>emuna</em> and the inner goodness of each Jew to braid a cord of unity and strength with which to connect to the Shechina and bring it home. This, Chazal teach us, is the formula for extricating ourselves from the morass of <em>golus</em>. It is not enough to seek spirituality. We must pull it inward. We cannot do it ourselves &#8211; we need every fiber of Jewry to pull together as one strong cord of strength. By doing so we can hope to fill our lives with His love and bring the <em>be’er </em>into our homes and thereby bring our homes to the ultimate <em>mikor</em> of <em>kedusha</em> in Yerushalayim Ir Hakodesh<br />
<em>bimheira biyameinu</em>.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Toldos<br />
The Man Makes the Clothes</h2>
<p>As Yaakov Avinu dons the <em>bigdei chamudos </em>of Eisav Harasha the impersonation of his brother is complete. He places goat skins on his neck and hands and enters the chamber of Yitzchok Avinu with the delicacies prepared by his mother. Something else accompanies him, too. As Yitzchok verifies Yaakov’s identity, he tenders a fatherly kiss, and notices a fragrant aroma streaming forth from Yaakov’s wardrobe and gives him a bracha. As he does so, Yitzchok exclaims; <em>“re’eh reiach b’nee kreiach hasadeh asher beracho Hashem</em>.” Chazal explain this to mean that the aroma of Gan Eden emanated from the very clothing Yaakov put on to visit his father.</p>
<p>One cannot help but wonder, why now? What was so unusual?  After all, the <em>bigdei chamudos </em>that Yaakov was wearing were the very same special clothes that Eisav himself wore when he went to serve his father. Didn’t the aroma of Gan Eden accompany them when Eisav wore them, too? Apparently not. Indeed, it is the man that makes the clothes and not vice versa.<span id="more-6477"></span></p>
<p>Chazal teach that Eisav’s <em>bigdei chamudos </em>was really the special cloak that Eisav took from Nimrod. This garment has a long history. It was the same outfit that Hashem Yisborach <em>kivayachol </em>fashioned for Adam and Chava, the k<em>osnos ohr</em>, He used to clothe them after He evicted them from Gan Eden. But if these clothes were given to Adam and Chava after their being thrown out of Gan Eden how do they carry its aroma?</p>
<p>The answer is found in our understanding of that first cloak. Though the posuk spells the word ohr with the letter ayin, meaning leather, the Midrash says, that in the Torah of  Rabbi Meir, the word ohr was written with an alef, meaning light. How are we to understand this Chazal?</p>
<p>Life in Gan Eden before the sin of Adam and Chava was supernatural. Wheat stalks grew from kernels into the finest cakes, right out of the ground! There was no need to further refine its nature. Its spiritual potential and physical essence were the perfect harmonious blend that Hashem Yisborach intended. All that changed after the <em>cheit</em> of Adam Harishon. No longer would the world produce a naturally finished product. Though man could no longer enjoy the instant Kedusha which surrounded him in Gan Eden, all was not lost. Hashem still gave us the opportunity of sanctifying this world. But now we would have to do it on our own. Hashem in his infinite kindness enabled us to recreate the essential Gan Eden experience. With hard work we are able to spiritualize the world gifted to us. We can imbue all we touch with ruchniyus. We can transform the <em>olam hagashmi,</em> symbolized by leather, (<em>ohr</em> with an <em>ayin</em>) into light &#8211; a spiritual luminescence – the <em>ohr</em> with an alef! In so doing we recreate the essence of Gan Eden in our lives today. This is the message of Rabbi Meir.</p>
<p>Indeed, this essence of Gan Eden was mastered by Yaakov Avinu, the <em>ish tam yosheiv ohalim</em>. He with his <em>middah</em> of <em>emes</em> was able to impart all the qualities of His <em>ruchniyus </em>and transform whatever <em>gashmiyus </em>came his way into a <em>cheftza shel kedusha</em>, mastering and harnessing its total spiritual potential. This is the <em>koach</em> that enables Yaakov to produce the 12 <em>shevatim</em>. Approaching Yitzchok Avinu with the <em>mitzvah</em> maximized to its fullest potential, the aroma of Gan Eden was now with him as well. No wonder that Eisav Harasha could never produce that fragrant scent while he wore those clothes. Only a Yaakov Avinu could bring out their <em>kedusha</em> to the fullest. We, his children have that same potential. We can bring the essence of Eden to the world each day. It is our ultimate <em>tachlis</em> and makes Hashem so very proud of all that we, His children, can achieve.</p>

<h2>Parshas Chayei Sarah<br />
Sweating the Small Stuff</h2>
<p><em>Parshas</em> Chaya Sarah commences with Avraham <em>Avinu</em> preparing for the funeral of his lifelong partner, his beloved wife, our matriarch Sarah <em>Imeinu.</em> Interestingly, the Midrash specifically lauds Avraham as the quintessential man of <em>chessed</em> as a result of his taking care of the funeral plans for his deceased wife, Sarah. This seems puzzling and the <em>mefarshim</em> wonder why is it that the act of the burial of Sarah is made into such a big deal. After all, that is what Avraham or anyone would do. It is normative typical behavior.</p>
<p>Why would such normal conduct be the defining moment in crowning Avraham as the <em>ish shel chessed</em> for which he is known and the man of <em>chessed</em> who we wish strive to emulate?<span id="more-6447"></span></p>
<p>The answer to this query provides us a phenomenal insight into the true definition of <em>chessed</em> that is so important for us to a remember. Simply put, <em>chessed</em> begins at home. but more importantly, <em>chessed</em> is primarily about attitude.</p>
<p>Indeed, being a <em>baal chessed</em> is not defined by the big things which generate headlines, rather, true <em>chessed</em> is found in taking care of the little things, considerately. The act of burying Sarah wasn’t what defined Avraham’s greatness as a <em>baal chessed,</em> rather, it was how he went about the internment of his beloved wife that established his greatness in <em>chessed.</em></p>
<p>The message is profound. Each day is filled with a plethora of chessed opportunities starting from the very moment we wake up. We must attempt to emulate Avraham <em>Avinu</em> in each of the little things in life that seem to be routine or mundane. <em>Chessed</em> is found at the breakfast table, in our morning greetings in how we handle the expected and the seemingly trivial moments of life. Indeed, <em>chessed</em> is defined in how we do the little things. Saying good morning with a smile, making others feel important, being cheerful and kind in our personal relationships can all be acts of <em>chessed,</em> if we do them with care.</p>
<p>Being kind when it is not meant to be noticed and going the extra mile with attention to detail and having sensitivity for the feelings of others in our day to day lives enables us to live the legacy of Avraham Avinu each day.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayera<br />
Place Your Faith in God</h2>
<p>The <em>posuk</em> says that as Avraham Avinu neared <em>Har Homoria</em> on the way to the <em>Akeida</em> he lifted his eyes,  “<em>Vayar Es Hamakom Meirachok”</em>— and he saw the place from afar. Typically this is translated as meaning that Avraham saw the mountain, <em>Har Hamoriah</em>, and what is now <em>Har Habyis</em>, from a distance. However, the <em>Sfas Emes</em> has a novel insight on the <em>Posuk</em> which carries a meaningful message for us all.<span id="more-6408"></span></p>
<p>The <em>Sfas Emes</em> powerfully explains that at a deeper level the word <em>&#8220;Makom&#8221;</em> in the <em>posuk</em> does not refer to the mountain-site destination of the <em>Akeida.</em> Rather, he says, it refers to <em>Hashem Yisborach</em> Himself. <em>“Hamakom”</em> (literally “the Place”) is one of the many names and manifestations <em>Kivayachol,</em> of the <em>Ribbono Shel Olam,</em> who is everywhere. Says the <em>Sfas Emes</em> — on the way to the <em>Akeida,</em> Avraham was at times filled with dread, fear and even doubt. He looked up and lifted his eyes to heaven for some clarity, <em>&#8220;Vayar es Hamakom Meirachok&#8221;</em> and felt his comprehension of the <em>derech</em> and <em>ratzon</em> Hashem to be very far away &#8211; very far indeed. How could he be asked to sacrifice his beloved son Yitzchok?</p>
<p>Is that really what a loving G-d would want? Nevertheless, Avraham Avinu went forward. He persevered. He alighted the mountain and scaled the highest peak of <em>Emunah</em> and <em>Bitachon.</em> Hakadosh Baruch Hu responded to Avraham’s <em>mesiras nefesh</em> and told him, “<em>V&#8217;ata Yadati Ki Yirei Elokim Ata</em>”—Now I know that you, Avraham, have a true fear of heaven. Yes, despite his reservations, lack of understanding and even doubt Avraham Avinu put Hashem&#8217;s desire first.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t we?</p>
<p>This dedication to the <em>Melech Malchei Hamilachaim</em> is a major part of Avraham’s legacy to us! It empowers us with the devotion to stand by our <em>Emunah</em> even when times are tough, when we don&#8217;t understand and when we feel lost and confused. Total <em>Bitachon</em> it is the ultimate formula for achieving the grandeur of <em>Gadlus Ha&#8217;adam</em> gifted to us by Avraham Avinu and for us to model to our children each and every day.</p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Lech Lecha<br />
Giving is Pure</h2>
<p>As the final step in his transformation from Avram into Avraham Avinu he and Bnai Yisrael are gifted the Mitzvah of Bris Milah for eternity. Interestingly this mitzvah is introduced with a fascinating phrase which provides us an amazing insight in to Avraham Avinus inspiring personality and a valuable lesson for us all. Let us explore further.</p>
<p>Hashem tells Avram, “<em>hishaeich lifanay v’heyei tamim</em>” &#8211; Walk before me and be pure. He then proceeds to change Avram’s name to Avraham, promise him Eretz Ysrael and conform his eternal covenant with his offspring, the Jewish people, in the <em>zechus</em> of Avraham and his children performing Bris Milah. How are we to understood this command of being <em>tamim </em>which eventually spawns the requirement of <em>tamim tehiyeh im Hashem Elokecha </em>Moshe demands of us in <em>sefer</em> Devarim?</p>
<p>The Midrash Tanchuma describes Avraham’s reaction to this statement and teaches that when  Avraham heard Hashem tell him <em>hishaeich lifanay v’heyei tamim </em>and was told to perform Bris Milah he was confused. Indeed, he was shaken up.<span id="more-6380"></span> Avraham, the Tanchuma says, said to himself, “how could it be that I have yet to become pure? I have totally dedicated myself to the Ribbono Shel Olam until now. What is left for me to do?</p>
<p>Furthermore, Avraham wondered, in the words of the Midrash, by performing a circumcision &#8220;I will be removing and damaging a part of my body, thereby causing an imperfection on myself.” How does that make me complete and pure?</p>
<p>Hashem guided Avraham through this conundrum and explained to him that what you think is whole, is really not yet perfect. Perfection of character and soul is not simply about taking care of what you have, it is about what one is willing to sacrifice and is willing to give. Giving up something for the Ribbono Shel Olam doesn&#8217;t diminish what you have, it actually improves who you are!</p>
<p>Indeed, to be a <em>tamim</em> one has to give. It is in the giving that we ascend the ladder of virtue and it is in  the giving we truly become complete.</p>
<p>This message must never be lost upon us. What defines us is not what we have but what we are willing to give. Time, money and love are just a few examples. But the more we give the more we have. And, the more we give the more we reinforce that covenant with Hashem Yisborach which assures our destiny as His Am Segulah and an <em>ohr la’amim </em>for all to see.</p>

<h2>Parshas Noach<br />
Old Fashioned Values</h2>
<p>This week we read of the great flood. The famed <em>mabul</em> erased all living things from the face of the earth except for Noach his children and the animals Hashem told him to put in the <em>teiva</em>. In describing the iniquities of humankind and the state of the world that led to the eradication of life outside of the <em>teiva,</em> the Torah tells us, <em>“vatishacheis haaretz lifnei haElokim—</em>the world was corrupted before Hashem.<em>”</em> In analyzing this <em>posuk. </em>the <em>meforshim</em> primarilay explore the types of <em>aveiros</em> which had been committed by society at large which caused their total decay. Indeed, they teach that the type of corruption that filled the land was the outgrowth of those sins which were <em>lifnei</em> Elokim, <em>gilui arayous</em>, <em>avoda zara</em> and <em>shfichas</em> <em>damim</em>—immorality, idolatry and murder. The world had become morally bankrupt with no moral discipline, G-dly aspirations or respect for the sanctity of life. As such, it was a world without a future and had to be destroyed and started over anew.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this verse, seems to have some superfluous wording. We were already told at the end of parshas Bereishis that Hashem saw <em>ki rabbas rah hadam baaretz —  </em>the world had turned evil. And, the very next posuk in parshas Noach tells us again, <em>vayar Elokim es haaretz v’henei nishchosa</em>. Our possuk, if needed at all, could just have said <em>vatishacheis haaretz—</em>the world was corrupt. What do we learn from being told that the corruption was <em>lifnei</em> haElokim— before the Ribbono Shel Olam?<span id="more-6353"></span></p>
<p>To answer this question we must examine more closely the essence of human nature and its collective impact on society at large? Indeed, a powerful lesson is being taught.</p>
<p>As society spiraled into its decadent ways the mores and norms of daily life changed. What was at one time forbidden became accepted. Steadily the value system deteriorated and that which was socially and morally repugnant just a few years earlier became the new standard of accepted behavior. So far had the <em>dor hamabul </em>strayed that they no longer even recognized right from wrong, they reversed them! In fact, those that tried holding onto the healthy values of the past were ridiculed as old fashioned, out of touch and ancient relics of days gone by. Indeed, society so strongly embraced its new behavior that it redefined the <em>pre-diluvian </em>normal. Ultimately, it was so bad that only Hashem could recall what should have been. It was only <em>lifnei HaElokim, </em>before G-d, that the world was corrupted — everyone else thought it was normal! What a powerful message.</p>
<p>History tends to repeat itself. The lessons of Noach and the <em>mabul</em> are as relevant as ever. Everyday we learn of something new. Ethics and values of yesteryear are relegated to the trash heap of history. Societies continue to produce new “normals” and reconstituted modern morals all the time. Yet, we must ask ourselves, are these new standards in consonance with what the Torah expects of us? Are we to embrace the new or hold onto the past? IS the new normal really normal?</p>
<p>We must learn from the <em>parsha</em> that the relative good of what is new and what is right and wrong cannot be left to human kind (or Madison Avenue) to define. We need a compass to assure that we are staying the course and headed in the right direction. We need a scale to properly weigh the conflicting messages which assault our <em>neshama</em> and character each day. Fortunately, Hakadosh Baruch Hu gifted us the Torah help us do just that. We must study it well and apply its message in our every endeavor.  It is the anchor to assure that our human drives match the standards and ambitions the Ribbono Shel Olam has for us all.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayelech<br />
That’s Our Song</h2>
<p>The last of the <em>Taryag</em> (613) Mitzvos of the Torah is found in this week’s Parsha. It is the requirement that each Jew write a Sefer Torah. There are many ways to fulfill this Mitzvah. One can commission the writing of a new Sefer Torah, purchase a “used” Torah, write in a single letter of a newly written scroll, or, according to some authorities, the Mitzvah can be carried out by purchasing Seforim of any sort.</p>
<p>It is easily understood why this obligation is the Torah’s final demand of us all. What is not so clear is why the Torah describes this Mitzvah by saying <em>kisvu lachem es hashira hazos</em>, write for yourselves this song &#8211; comparing the Torah <em>Hakedosha</em> to a melody.</p>
<p>One insight from the “Shearis Menachem” explains that a primary lesson of last week’s Parsha, Nitzavim, was the <em>Bris</em> of <em>Arvus</em> — that <em>kol Yisrael areivim zeh lazeh</em> &#8211; all Jews are interdependent. The Mitzvah of <em>Ksivas Sefer Torah</em> and the expectation that it be studied and taught from generation to generation embodies that same flavor. Indeed, he says, the symbolism of <em>Arvus</em> of <em>Klal Yisrael</em> with Talmud Torah is likened to the song of a large, magnificent and powerful choir.</p>

<h2>Parshas Nitzavim<br />
Together and One</h2>
<p>With the beginning of the new year just around the corner we greet the final Shabbos of the year with some powerful messages from Parshas Nitzavim. One powerful insight captures the challenge, destiny and opportunity of klal Yisroel and can serve as the impetuous for a most fulfilling <em>Yom haDin</em>.</p>
<p>The parsha begins with Moshe telling klal Yisroel “<em>atem nitzavim hayom</em>” &#8211; “today, you the totality of the Jewish people are standing and making a <em>Bris</em> with <em>Hashem Yisborach</em>. As Moshe speaks to the people he warns them to be wary of the temptations that will confront them and how we will be punished if we sin and as a result become <em>r”l</em> distanced from Him, the source of all good. We are also taught that when we return to him and cling to him, the very consequences that befell us when we erred, will, instead, fall on our enemies. The message is clear we can be assured of our national destiny and strength if we stay close to <em>Hashem Yisborach</em>.<span id="more-6266"></span></p>
<p>Interestingly, however, as the parsha draws to a conclusion the conversation changes and the vernacular shifts from the plural to the singular. The Torah says <em>r’ei nasstai lifanecha hayom es hachaim v’es hatov</em>, &#8211; today I am giving you (as an individual) the power of choice, the ability to make decisions of life and death, of good and bad and of spiritual and the physical. This switch between plural and singular is no accident or error in grammar. <em>Moshe Rabeinu</em> understood that when we speak to the masses each person can think <em>Hashem</em> is talking to someone else. People think the words are for them, not for me. Therefore, Moshe wraps up his message to <em>Am Yisrael</em>, by reminding us that the totality of <em>Klal Israel</em> is comprised of individuals. Each person counts. Each person needs to be responsible. Each person is a treasure. So Moshe shifts to the singular to remind us that it is the collection of each yachid that makes up the <em>Klal</em>.</p>
<p>However, one question still remains. If the power of the people is reflected in the acts of each <em>yachid</em> why speak of the entirety of <em>Am Yisroel</em> in plural at all. Why not focus the remarks singularly on each individual Jew from the very beginning? The answer is profoundly simple. The dual approach is to remind and affirm for us that we are part of a <em>tzibur</em> and every single Jew is a part, <em>meichoteiv eitzecha ad shoev meimecha</em>. From the wood choppers to the water carriers every Jew counts. As each individual perfects his <em>avodas Hashem</em> we create a <em>tzibur</em> that blends the talents and <em>kochos</em> of each and every Jew into one panoramic vista of <em>Am Yisroel</em> of whom <em>Hashem</em> is so proud.</p>
<p>May we be <em>zoche</em> to use the strengths of our avodas <em>Hashem</em> and the responsibility of our arvus to come before the <em>kisei hakovod</em> and be <em>mamlich</em> <em>Hashem Yisborach</em> through the power of our own deeds and the collective strength of our people to be blessed with a <em>shana tova umisuka</em>.</p>

<h2>Parshas Beha&#8217;aloscha<br />
Coming and Going</h2>
<p>The gift of life provides us the opportunity to earn <em>Olam Habah</em>, the ultimate reward for Mitzvah observance and appreciation of Hashem in this world. The trek to eternity leads us to many stations along the roadway of life. Each stop has its own unique significance and impact upon us and our family. How can we be sure to seek the proper destination? What can we do to absorb the spirit of the moment and capture its message in our day to day existence? This week’s parsha lends us a clue.</p>
<p>The Torah describes how the <em>Shechina</em> enveloped the Mishkan with the <em>Ananei Hakovod</em> during the day and a pillar of fire each eve. When the moment arrived for klal yisrael to travel the cloud lifted and started to move. Then, the Aron picked itself up and set forth to lead and Bnei Yisroel followed. When the Jews arrived at their destination, the cloud stopped and the Aron was anchored. Bnei Yisrael pitched their tents and erected the Mishkan.</p>
<p>The Torah uses two different descriptions to define the scenarios of Klal Yisrael’s course through the desert.<span id="more-5689"></span> One description is <em>al pi Hashem <strong>yisu</strong> v&#8217;al bnai Yisrael v’al pi Hashem <strong>yachanu</strong></em> — “through the command of Hashem they traveled and through His word they encamped.” The other phrase is just the opposite, <em>al pi Hashem <strong>yachanu</strong> v’al pi Hashem <strong>yisau</strong></em> &#8211; “through the command of Hashem they encamped and through His word they traveled.”</p>
<p>Our Rabbis explain that the phraseology is reversed to teach us that we must always keep Hashem Yisborach front and center of our lives. Whether we have “just arrived” or are “settled in,” we must be ever cognizant that it is Hashem who made it happen. However, Hakaodsh Baruch Hu leaves it up to us to recognize our obligations. Indeed, it seems easy to follow the Aron while it is on the move. We look up at the Shechina and join the mass of Am Yisrael as we are miraculously carried by the strength of the Tzibbur. But encamped for months and/or years at a time we can become complacent. Al pi Hashem Yachanu, reminds us that wherever we are, the Shechina is present and our responsibilities do not change. Conversely, there are times when we seek to change the status quo, to go off on our own and court new vistas of opportunity. In so doing we must be vigilant to the maxims of our emunah and remember, Al pi Hashem Yisu.</p>
<p><em>Al pi Hashem Yachanu, al pi Hashem Yisau</em>. Hashem comes with us wherever we go and we can make him proud. Indeed, when we go forth with Hashem Yisborach at out side can we achieve all we aspire for. Thus the conclusion of the Posuk becomes ever clearer: <em>es mishmeres Hashem shamaru al pi Hashem b’yad Moshe!</em></p>

<h2>Parshas Behar &#8211; Bechukosai<br />
Standing Tall</h2>
<p>Parshas Bechukosai commences with the hope and promise of the abundant <em>Birchos Shamayim</em>. All that is expected of us is <em>bichukosai teilechu</em> – <em>shthiyu ameilim baTorah</em>, that we should toil in Torah and in turn receive Hashem’s bountiful blessings. A progressive, ever increasing measure of bracha is presented to us. These brochos, however, are immediately followed by the <em>Tochacha</em>. Sadly, Klal Yisrael knows the trauma and tragedy of this Parsha all too well. Our history is painted with suffering throughout the ages.</p>
<p>With so much bracha to be had, we must explore, where and why does tragedy begin and how <em>b’ezras Hashem</em> it can be prevented. Perhaps the <em>smichus haparshiyos</em> gives us clue.<span id="more-5589"></span></p>
<p>The opening brachos of the Parsha conclude with the words <em>v’oleich eschem kommimiyus.</em> Rashi explains: I will accompany you <em>b’komah zkufah</em> with an upright posture, a proud and regal bearing. Indeed, when all is well with Klal Yisrael, this is the epitome of<em> birchos Shamayim</em>, the ultimate gift – to be able to walk proudly, side by side with the Ribbono Shel Olam as His <em>oveid</em>. Nothing could be greater or more noble. However, this posuk is surprisingly followed by the disastrous statement of the very next verse, <em>v’im lo sishmu li</em> – if you will not listen to Me. Suddenly, tragedy begins. Why? How could there have been such a swift transition from <em>bracha to klalla</em>? How did we go from <em>bichukosei teleichu</em>, walking with Hashem Yisborach <em>b’koma zkufa</em> to r”l, <em>lo sishmu,</em> to not listening?</p>
<p>Perhaps the <em>smichas hapsukim</em> is telling us that the barometer of our devotion to ratzon Hashem or <em>chas v’shalom</em> our demise lies in the sense of <em>kommiyus </em>– the<em> koma zkufa</em>, the noble pride we have in our mitzvah observance. When we stand proud of our yiddishkeit and derive dignity and delight in doing His will, we stand tall. All of His brachos are ours! It is only when there is a break-down, however small it begins, in our sense of the nobility of being His <em>Am Segula</em> that the – possibility of <em>lo sishmu</em> can exist. It is the proud Jew who listens to the Ribbono Shel Olam and <em>kivayachol</em> partners with Him in being an <em>ohr La’amim</em>. It is a role to savor. Only the Jew who, <em>r”l</em>, lacks pride, begins to distance himself from the warm embrace of Hashem Yisborach, His Torah and His mitzvos. Without pride, our motivation to do His will is muted. We turn astray and the <em>Yetzer Harah</em> begins to dominate us until <em>v’lo sishmu</em> becomes the norm.</p>
<p>As we prepare for Shavuos and <em>Kabbolas Hatorah</em> we must remember <em>ashrienu mah tov chelkeinu,</em> we are indeed fortunate to be part of the <em>Am Hanivchar; </em>we are <em>banim laHashem</em>. We must stand proud. As Dovid Hamelech exclaims, <em>Hashem Melech <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Geus</span> Laveish</em>…Hashem Yisborach is cloaked in pride, so can we. In so doing, we can merit a life of bracha filled with nachas from our children who will follow our model and grow to be proud, happy and noble partners with Hakadosh Baruch Hu with a <em>gishmak</em> in <em>avodas Hashem</em> which will continue to inspire future generations. Our <em>limud haTorah</em> and our<em> kiyum hamitzvos</em> – indeed, our very future depend upon it.</p>

<h2>Parshas Emor<br />
U&#8217;Smachtem</h2>
<p>Parshas Emor contains the<em> Parshas HaMoadim</em>, a chapter of Chumash devoted almost exclusively to the <em>Yomim Tovim</em>. Among the many requirements contained therein is the Mitzvah of <em>Simcha</em> to rejoice and be happy on Yom Tov. The Kli Yakar derives a very important lesson from this context. Its message is timeless.</p>
<p>The Mitzvah of <em>usimachtem</em> is recorded by the Yom Tov of Sukkos following the laws of the Arbah Minim. This, he explains, is to teach us that <em>Ein Simchaschem lifnei Hashem ki im b’zman she’heim agudah achas </em>&#8211; There is no true Simcha enjoyed with Hashem unless Klal Yisrael is united  <em>b’Achdus</em>, as one. Moreover, we are taught that the mitzvah of Simcha is a constant requirement. A Jew is to live with a Simchas Hachayim each and every day of his or her life. So why is the Mitzvah specified in juxtaposition to the Yom Tov of Sukkos? What is the hidden message being taught?<span id="more-5527"></span></p>
<p>Hashem, he explains, is defining for us the context of simcha. True Simcha is not about self indulgence. Happiness should never be confused with satiating desire or instant gratification. Rather, true joy is found <em>all year long, </em>following the Sukkos formula. Indeed, the spiritual nirvana we are to seek is attained by stepping out of our material confines (into the sukkah), sanctifying the earthly possessions we have produced (arbah Minim), feeling connected and protected by the <em>Shechina</em> on high (<em>schach</em>) as we share His bounty with each of our guests (<em>ushpizin</em>). This is the formula for the healthy Torah lifestyle we can share with our families.</p>
<p>It is especially critical in today’s “instant messaging” era. We can and must learn to refine our goals and aspirations for true happiness. Only when we neutralize the material competitiveness which disunites us and discover the true joy of spirit the world of Torah, Mitzvos and Ma&#8217;asim Tovim provide us can we truly connect with each other and to Hashem Yisborach as one.</p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Acharey Mos &#8211; Kedoshim<br />
Breaking Barriers</h2>
<p>Parshas Kedoshim is chockful of Mitzvos, all of which direct us toward the goal of living a Torah life imbued with the mantra of <em>Kedoshim Tihiyu</em>. At first glance, one such Mitzvah seems so easy, yet, according to the Ohr Hachayim Hakodesh, it is a constant struggle. Indeed, it is a Mitzvah which expands or r”l constrains our Kedushah potential. It is the Mitzvah of <em>elohei maseicha lo sa’aseh lach. </em></p>
<p>Most of the mifarshei hamikrah focus this commandment on the <em>azahara</em> to not even fashion idols for others. However, with the Yetzer Harah for idolatry neutered by Chazal, we find the whole notion of idolatry repugnant, even silly. Furthermore, as the Ohr Hachayim Hakadosh points out, this issur is already included in the general Halachos of avoda zara. He therefore renders a different approach that is especially inspirational during this sefira season.<span id="more-5487"></span></p>
<p>He explains, “when a person performs a mitzvah, the Shechina rests upon him. But when one r”l does an aveira, a ruach tumah sets upon him  – v’hu <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">masach</span> hamavdil beino uvein Elokav</em> &#8211; it forms a barrier between him and the Ribbono Shel Olam.” Comes the Torah to teach us, with all of the bounty I have provided you – strive for Kedusha. The secret: <em>elohei maseicha lo sa’aseh lach</em>, do not create barriers between yourself and Hakadosh Baruch Hu. Why? The posuk continues, “Ani Hashem Elokeichem” &#8211;  for I am Hashem your G-d. When our relationship is barrier free we can appreciate the reality of Hashem Yisborach’s kindness and hashgocha, 24/7. Barrier free, we can appreciate the gift of Torah u’mitzvos and our opportunity and responsibility of being an ohr la’amim. With out any obstacles in the way, the road to perfection is smooth traveling. It seems so easy.</p>
<p>But as the Rambam explains, when one succumbs to temptation, he can get stuck in the quagmire of <em>cheit</em>. In so doing, layer of upon layer of thicker and thicker material form a blockade between the Shechina and the <em>neshama</em> so desperate to see its Father. We can degrade into the ultimate<em> hester panim</em>, as a thick iron curtain of sin obstructs our view of Kudsha Brich Hu until He seems almost non-existent, chas v’shalom. This was the most pernicious impact of the golden calf, the e<em>igel maseicha</em> which Klal Yisrael fashioned in the desert. And sadly, that barrier to giluy shechina and the clarity of the luchos rishonos is still with us today. We are challenged to  tear down the vestiges of the eigel hazahav’s obstruction to emunah found in each generation and eliminate as well the impediments to emunah rooted in our own personal iniquities.</p>
<p>How can we succeed?  Sefiras Ha’omer provides the answer. We count toward matan Torah. One day at a time, we dismantle the barricades. Through Talmud Torah, <em>asiyas HaMitzvos</em> and refinement of our middos, we invite, as the Ohr Hachayim points out, the Shechina back into our lives and in so doing we eliminate the barriers found along the way. Indeed, with the avodah of each day’s count, we can, <em>b’ezras Hashem</em>, eliminate the hindrances to revelation and spiritual clarity. Inching ever closer to feel His presence, and achieving a life lived as kedoshim &#8211;<em> ki kadosh ani Hashem Elokeichem!</em></p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Tazria-Metzora<br />
Toras HaYoledes</h2>
<p>The study of <em>smichas haparshiyos</em> always reveals fascinating insights into the inner meanings of Torah. Text and context are so vital in shaping the values and mores that are to shape our outlook as well. One significant message is presented by Chazal as we traverse the <em>yesodos</em> of <em>parshas</em> Shimini, read last week, and begin the study of <em>parshas</em> Metzorah this Shabbos. It is a bridge which reminds us of the proper context of our <em>avodas </em>Hashem still today.</p>
<p>Chazal note that <em>parshas</em> Shmini concludes by summing up the laws of <em>kashrus</em> using the phrase, “<em>zos Toras habihama.” </em>Our <em>parsha</em> begins with the renewal of human existence and the birth of children entering the world and the words “<em>zos Toras hayoledes.”</em> The commentaries wonder why the <em>Toras habihama</em> precedes the <em>Toras haadam</em>. Surely, it is people who are the focus of creation. Shouldn’t we study the creation of man and then follow it with the <em>Toras habihama?</em> What is to be understood from the sequence of these <em>psukim</em>?<span id="more-5455"></span></p>
<p>To answer this question, the Midrash introduces the <em>parsha</em> with the <em>posuk</em> from Tehillim (139:4) <em>Achor vakedem tzartani</em> <em>— “</em>backwards and forwards You shaped me<em>.” </em>Says R’ Yishmael bar Tanchum <em>“Achor l’chal hamaasim v’kodem l’chol ha’onshim&#8230;— </em>you are last with regards to your actions (you are the pinnacle of creation), yet you are the first for all of consequences (if you abuse life)<em>.”  </em>The Midrash continues—if you are worthy then all of creation was prepared for you. However if <em>r”l</em> one is unworthy then even the gnat has preceded you in<em> ma’aseh breishis. </em></p>
<p>The message of this lesson is powerful. Of all the creatures of the world, only human kind needs guidance and training to be successful. Beavers need not attend engineering school. Fish do not take swimming lessons and bees are exempt from food chemistry courses. It is only people that need education and coaching to master their destiny and fulfill their role in this world. Our performance is in our own hands. Chazal are reminding us that the sequence of <em>Toras habihama</em> preceding <em>Toras haadam</em> is to deliver context and meaning to our spiritual destiny. If we learn, study and continually grow, then the <em>Toras habihama</em> and indeed, the entire world is the gift which greets us to enjoy a beautiful world filled with all of His bounty. By providing us a world ready with all that we need, Hakadosh Baruch Hu has given each of us all of the tools we could possibly desire to achieve our spiritual destiny. We can rise to the apex of piety and the spiritual nirvana toward which we aspire to soar.  But, if the gift of life and the opportunity to do <em>mitzvos</em> are not taken advantage of, and His bountiful blessings are wasted through our apathy, indifference and self-centered laziness, resulting in sin, then we are truly no different than the insignificant gnat created early on in the six days of creation. In fact we are worse. They, after all, are fulfilling their prescribed role but we, who have free choice, are not doing ours. What a waste.</p>
<p>As we progress through the “count-up” to Shavuos, this lesson is a vital reminder of our personal and national mission as an <em>ohr l’amim</em>. We can only illuminate the world if we are willing to use His gifts to bring <em>kavod</em> and glory to His name through our actions. That is the true purpose of life, to take the <em>Toras habihama</em> and all of the <em>olam hagashmi</em> it symbolizes and sanctify it through the spiritual potential of <em>Toras haadam</em>.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Shemini<br />
Darosh Darash</h2>
<p>With this week’s parsha we find ourselves at the midpoint of  Toraseinu. Chazal are fascinated by the fact that the first half of the Torah ends and the second half of the Torah begins with the same word. We are told (Vayikra 10:16)  <em>“v’es se’ir hachatass darosh darash Moshe.” </em>Moshe urgently sought out whether or not the details of the sacrificial service rites had been performed correctly. Despite the horrific tragedy of the death of Aharon Hakohein’s two precious sons (Moshe’s nephews!), Moshe, assertively inquired, a double expression of Doreish,  as to whether or not the<em> ratzon Hashem</em> was being fulfilled and to the very last specific detail.<span id="more-5417"></span></p>
<p>It is no coincidence that this phrase, <em>darosh-darash</em>, is at the very center of the Torah. This teaches us not only about Moshe Rabbeinu but about what ought to be front and center of our lives each day. <em>Darosh-darash</em>, it is the end and beginning of everything. <em>Darosh-darash</em>, we are being reminded that assertively seeking out Hashem Yisborach, finding fulfillment in talmud Torah and striving to be meticulous in our standard of Mitzvah observance is at the heart of our spiritual destiny. Like Moshe Rabbeinu, even when tragedy strikes our life is anchored with <em>darosh-darash</em>, probing, seeking and searching for an even  greater spiritual relationship with Hashem Yisborach. He is everywhere.</p>
<p>However, we need not wait, <em>rachmana litzlan</em>, for catastrophe to strike. Blessed with His bountiful goodness, He gives us the opportunity to see Him in the <em>hashgacha pratis</em> that governs our life each day. <em>Darosh-darash</em>, from matters of <em>parnasah</em> to family, work to play, He is there holding our hand and guiding us along the way.</p>
<p>We are told that the Baal Shem Tov once  asked his students, “Where is Hashem?” Not one of their answers was satisfactory. Finally the students turned to their mentor in wonder, and asked “So, Rebbe, where is He?” Responded the Besh”t , — “Hashem, He is wherever <em>you </em>let Him in!”</p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Pesach 2012</h2>
<p>Shir Hashirim Shlomo Hameelech’s great Song of Songs, teaches us just how much <em>kivayachol</em>, Hashem Yisborach loves us. This relationship is <em>kodesh kadashim</em> but is so difficult to comprehend. Nevertheless, it is part and parcel of the <em>zman cheiruseinu</em>. In fact, it is of the deepest fundamental <em>yesodos</em> of our Pesach experience. It is the ambition we seek in our <em>Sede</em> ritual. How are we to capture its essence and elevate our <em>yom tov</em> sensation to the madreiga of “<em>ahavas klulosayich</em>” which we all aspire to feel? One midrash can help.<span id="more-5338"></span></p>
<p>Most our familiar with the phrase from Shir Hashirim, <em>kol dodi henei zeh ba</em>. We are familiar as well with the <em>medrashic</em> statement <em>zeh Melech haMashiach</em>!  However, many are not well versed with the entirety of the medrash. Let us explore further. As this powerful <em>aggadah</em> in Shir Hashirim Rabbah (2:19) commences it states; <em>“R’ Yehuda omeir kol dodi zeh Moshe Rabbeinu</em>” and it begins a narrative which is repeated with a series of variations all echoing an identical theme. Says the <em>medrash</em>, when Moshe Rabbeinu announced to klal Yisrael that it is time for you to be redeemed they responded, how so? Could it be true that the time for geula has arrived? It is not yet time (400 years have not passed), we are not worthy, we have no <em>maasim tovim</em> and we have <em>r”l </em>filled the streets of Mitzryaim with our worship of <em>avodah zarah</em>? How could we be <em>roei</em> for <em>geula</em>?</p>
<p>The medrash records Moshe response. It is written in two ways with a very a subtle disparity between them. In one instance the Medrash records that Moshe told Klal Yisrael, do not worry,<em> ho’eel v’Hu chafetz b’geluaschem eino mabit b’maseichem haraaim</em>. Since He (Hashem Yisborach) wants to redeem you, He looks not at your actions and He will take you out of Mitzrayim. In the subsequent report of Moshe Rabbeinu’s conversation with Klal Yisrael an almost identical refrain is provided. Just one word is different, the word <em>v’Hu</em> (and He) is left out. Instead it reads <em>ho’eel v’chafetz b’geulaschem eino mabit</em>. . . this can be understood to mean since you, Klal Yisrael, truly desire <em>geula</em> and the connection to the Shechina it brings, Hashem Yisborach will overlook your iniquities and deliver you from the bondage of Egypt!</p>
<p>In other words, Moshe Rabbeinu tells Bnai Yisrael, Hashem Yisborach’s decision to ignore our <em>aveiros</em> and provide us with <em>geula</em> is dependent upon our desire to be closer to Him. If we want it – it will be! Such is the <em>ahavas klulosayich, </em>our a bi-directional relationship with Kiviyachol, the Ribbono Shel Olam. We need to give ourselves to Him and He, in turn, gives Himself to us. Indeed, the more we want Him in our lives the more He will allow us to feel His presence in all that we do. That is the essence of the <em>Ahava</em> – the loving and giving that we must feel for Hakadosh Baruch Hu if we want to feel His love in our lives.</p>
<p><em>Kol dodi henei zeh bah</em>. We must remember that the triumph of the <em>seder</em> ritual is found in attaining the<em> </em>relationship<em> </em>of a<em>havas klulosayich. </em>It is the ultimate <em>Avodah </em>of the Seder experience. Beginning with the <em>arabah kosos</em>, it is the goal we seek as we ascend the fifteen steps of the <em>simanei haseder.</em> Each one brings us ever closer to the ultimate <em>dveikus baShechina</em>. If we are successful we arrive to the <em>madreiga</em> of <em>nirtzah &#8211; </em>where our want for Him is matched by His desire for us. What a valuable message for us all; He is waiting for us still! We know that Mitzrayim is the quintessential definition of the <em>geula</em> paradigm. A <em>geula </em>we need now more than ever. And more than ever, it depends on us. We need to want it so He will too. We must ask ourselves, <em>tzipisa liyeshua</em>? Are we anticipating salvation? The <em>kol hataor</em>, the voice of <em>mashiach</em> is waiting for ours to join him song. Why not now? Surely, it is time for us all to sing.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayakhel-Pekudei<br />
The House the Moshe Built</h2>
<p><strong>T</strong>he Mishkan completed and assembled is described by the mifarshim as the “house that Moshe built.” Chazal tell us that although Betzalel, Ahaliav, and a variety of artisans, smiths and craftsmen did their respective jobs, Moshe is credited with the Mishkan’s completion.  This is because Moshe not only oversaw the construction of the Mishkan  but was <em>Moser Nefesh—totally dedicated</em> to its design and completion.</p>
<p>This is so typical of Moshe Rabbeinu, who selflessly shepherded Klal Yisrael through forty years in the desert.<span id="more-5280"></span> He gave his all for Hakadosh Baruch Hu, His Torah and Klal Yisrael. In describing Moshe Rabbeinu’s legacy, the Midrash opens the Parsha by quoting the Posuk from Mishlei, <em>“</em><em>Ish emunas rav brachos&#8221;</em>—a man of faith has many brachos. This posuk, we’re told, teaches us that <em>kol mi shehu ne’eman Hakadosh Baruch Hu mavi brachos al  yado</em>—“whoever possesses emuna, Hashem Yisborach brings brocha through his hands.” The mifarshim explain that this is not only limited to Moshe Rabbeinu but refers to all those who act like him. Moreover, we are being taught that there is a direct correlation between the brachos we receive and provide to others and our own faith in Hashem Yisborach.</p>
<p>Indeed we are being taught that each of us can each be like Moshe in regard to one specific domain: emuna. How can this be? Is it really possible to replicate the emunah of Moshe Rabbeinu who spoke, kivyachol, to Hashem <em>panim el Panim</em>-face to face? The answer is an emphatic “yes”.</p>
<p>What is emuna? Rav Avigdor Miller zt”l explains that emuna is not simply faith but rather, <em>loyalty</em>. Therein lies the key. We are all supposed to be loyal, devoted and dedicated to the Ratzon Hashem. Emunah is not merely about a feeling of spiritual connectivity that we can take for granted and reflect upon when convenient. That’s only a start. It is about more deeply committing ourselves to Him day in and day out. Putting His will first and our needs second. It is about becoming a skilled, master craftsman of Hashem’s desire, personifying His will in each move we make. In good times and moments more challenging, our loyalty makes the difference.  True, we may never reach the madreiga of a Moshe Rabbeinu. Yet as much as we cannot achieve his “reach,” we <em>can</em> match his effort. We can give 100% of <em>our</em> devotion to Hashem Yisborach and access His shefa brachos to enrich our lives, those of our family, and all of Klal Yisrael, IY”H .</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></address>
<h2>Parshas Ki Sisa<br />
Hashem&#8217;s Tfillin</h2>
<p>We find in Parshas Ki Sissa the catastrophic sin of the <em>eigel hazahav</em>, which tragically placed Klal Yisrael at the precipice of destruction. Moshe Rabbeinu beseeches Hakadosh Baruch Hu on our behalf. He successfully assuages Hashem Yisborach’s anger and insured our survival to this very day. Realizing that he was privileged to experience an obvious <em>eis ratzon</em>, Moshe is emboldened to ask for a keener understanding of Hashem Yisborach. He implores Hakadosh Baruch Hu, “<em>Hareini nah es Kvodecha”</em>&#8211; to reveal Himself, to offer His <em>eved</em> a more comprehensive understanding of who He is. Hashem Yisborach responds by saying “<em>v’raisa es acharei upanei lo yerau</em>” – no human can see the full, frontal glory of Hashem. You, Moshe, therefore cannot see My “front,” but I will reveal to you My “back.”</p>
<p>Hakadosh Baruch Hu’s enigmatic response to Moshe’s request is hard to understand.<span id="more-5262"></span> We attribute no real anthropomorphisms to Hashem Yisborach. Moreover, how does this address Moshe Rabbeinu’s request to understand Hakadosh Baruch Hu? Seemingly, Moshe is asking to understand the depth of Hashem’s compassion for Klal Yisrael who He has just spared from annihilation. Rashi, too, is concerned with understanding the posuk and quotes the Chazal that declares that showing His back to Moshe meant that <em>Her’ahu kesher shel Tfillin – </em>Hashem Yisborach showed Moshe the knot of His tfillen shel rosh. This only seems to confound us further. How does this answer Moshe’s request? And what are we to learn from this episode today?</p>
<p>The Gemara in maseches B’rachos teaches that Hashem Yisborach indeed wears Tfillin. Unlike our tfillin which contain the parsha of Shma Yisrael, our affirmation of kabbolos ol malchus Shamayim, Hashem’s Tfillin contain the posuk<em> Mi k’amcha Yisrael</em> &#8211; &#8220;who is like My people Israel?&#8221;. Amazingly, Hashem Yisborach’s T’fillin reflect His love and relationship with us, His chosen people. Perhaps this explains our query.</p>
<p>Moshe Rabbeinu successfully defended Klal Yisrael from their terrible sin of the golden calf. He invoked the <em>yud-gimmel middos</em> and recalled the zechuyos of our avos, Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaakov. But what, <em>k’vyachol,</em> was the source of Hashem’s forgiveness? It was the simple fact that, despite our iniquities, He loves us. Moshe Rabbeinu wondered if there was more. Says Hakadosh Baruch Hu, the depth of My <em>ahava</em> cannot be understood by the living. However, My <em>relationship </em>with you can be. He communicated that by showing Moshe the kesher shel Tfillin. In this case, “kesher” does not refer to a <em>knot</em> being shown to Moshe. Rather, it’s the <em>Kesher</em> <em>– </em>the<em> relationship</em> of Mi k’amcha Yisrael, represented by the tefillin of Hashem Yisborach. Moshe then came to appreciate the essential ideal that our kabbalos ol malchus shamayim and relationship with Hashem Yisborach is a two way connection. We are not only expected to love Hakadosh Baruch Hu but we are gifted with Him loving us back!</p>
<p>It was this relationship that saved us and it is this relationship that ought to inspire us each day. As we proclaim, <em>Shema Yisrael Hashem Elokeinu Hashem Echad</em> thrice daily, we must always remember that Hashem Yisborach proclaims <em>Mi k’amcha Yisrael</em>. We have but to be worthy of His heart to stay in touch with our own.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></address>
<h2><em></em>Parshas Titzaveh<br />
Viyikchu Li- Viyikchu Eilecha</h2>
<p>The <em>parshiyos </em>of <em>Terumah </em>and <em>Tetzaveh </em>follow the exclamation of <em>na’aaseh v’nishma</em> which concludes <em>parshas Mishpatim.</em> Each <em>parsha</em> begins with the word <em>v’yikchu</em>, you should take. <em>Terumah</em> commences with <em>viyikchu <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Li </span>teruma</em>—take for Me (Hashem) and <em>Titzaveh</em> opens with <em>viyikchu <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eilecha</span></em> take for you. What is about the building of the <em>Mishkan</em> that helps us make this transition from taking and giving to Hashem to acquiring for ourselves? What can we learn from it today? One approach is found in how Chazal explain the relationship between <em>matan Torah</em> and the <em>hakomas hamishkan.</em></p>
<p>Chazal teach us that the relationship of <em>hakoras hatov</em> &#8211; expressing appreciation, is integrally bound up with the <em>matan Torah</em> experience. Indeed, it is only after <em>Klal Yisrael</em> receives the most precious of gifts, our priceless Torah, that Hashem Yisborach directs us to build a <em>Mishkan</em> and fashion the <em>Aron</em> to hold the <em>Luchos</em>, a <em>Menorah </em>to illuminate our lives, a <em>Shulchan</em> to dedicate our worldly assets to the <em>Borei Olam</em> and construct two diatinct <em>mizbachos</em> to harness our m<em>esiras nefesh</em> which provide the sweet fragrance and aroma that should innately surround every Jew.<span id="more-5223"></span></p>
<p>The reality is that the <em>Mishkan</em> itself was to be our tool to express the ultimate sense of appreciation to <em>Hashem Yisborach</em> for elevating our stature, as He selected us as His chosen people. Though priceless in value, we somehow attempt to thank Hashem for bestowing His royal status upon us, giving us His Torah and calling us His children. This we express through our drive to fulfill <em>viyikchu Li</em> to give to Hashem—as we build and serve in the <em>Mishkan</em>. Once we have generously been thankful to Him we are allowed to enjoy <em>vikchu eilecha</em> to take for ourselves the gifts of health, happiness and <em>nachas</em> he has bestowed upon us each and every day.</p>
<p>Only by giving to Him do we truly take for ourselves!</p>
<p>But there is more, another nuance that deepens the message. One cannot help but notice that the venue of <em>viyikchu eilecha</em> is prefaced with the charge <em>v’ata titzaveh es bnai Yisrael</em> – <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span> should command klal Yisrael. Although the technical <em>tzivui</em> of the <em>parsha</em> is related to the preparation of oil for the <em>menorah</em>, Chazal teach us that the essence of the beginning of the parsha is really is about the transmission of our Mesorah through <em>Torah Shebaal Peh</em> as represented by the<em> menorah</em>. We are being taught <em>v’ata titzaveh</em> – you must command and transmit the <em>Torah</em> to another generation. Each Jew must view this responsibility as a personal obligation. For only through the authentic transmission of <em>mesorah</em> will we be able to serve as the <em>ohr la’amim Hashem Yisborach</em> intended.</p>
<p>When we combine these two ideas we are left with a profound message. Indeed, we are being taught that the pivotal criterion in transitioning from <em>viyikchu li into viykchu eilecha</em> is our fidelity to the transmission of Torah <em>shebaal peh</em>. When we follow through on our responsibility to pass the torch of Torah forward, bestow that legacy to our children and cloak them with the mantle of leadership to themselves be transmitters of Torah we are then empowered to actualize all of His gifts for a life filled with the Yiddishe <em>Nachas</em> for which we strive.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></em></p>
<h2>Parshas Mishpatim<br />
Learn With Your Children!</h2>
<p>The conclusion of <em>parshas </em>Mishpatim features a return to the description <em>matan </em>Torah. We are told how Moshe Rabbeinu alighted Har Sinai. Upon his return, Moshe told Bnai Yisrael <em>es kol divrei Hashem v’es kol hamishpatim</em> &#8211; all the words of Hashem and all of His laws. Klal Yisrael responded in unison and proclaimed, “<em>kol divrei Hashem na’aseh.</em>” Whatever Hashem says we will do. This is the second time since the saga of <em>matan</em> Torah began to unfold that Bnai Yisrael responds to the gift of the Torah with an emphatic <em>na’aseh</em> &#8211; we will do! Nevertheless, despite the sincere motivation of Am Yisrael, their declaration of <em>na’aseh</em> is simply not enough. Finally, <em>kabbolas HaTorah</em> reaches its zenith a few Psukim later as, Klal Yisrael exclaims <em>na’aseh v’nishma! </em>Crowned with this most famous, wondrous refrain of &#8211; <em>we will do and we will hear</em>, <em>matan</em> Torah is complete. We are gifted the <em>Torah Hak’dosha</em> for eternity.</p>
<p>What caused the change in our response? Why did we jump from <em>na’aseh</em> to <em>nishma</em>? What finally inspired us?<span id="more-5169"></span></p>
<p>The Midrash tells us that during <em>matan </em>Torah<em>, Hashem Yisborach</em> demanded a guarantor from Klal Yisrael that we would watch and protect the gift of Torah being granted to them. At first, Klal Yisrael suggested the Avos. However, Hashem said no. Klal Yisrael then suggested <em>shamayim va’aretz</em>. Again, Hakadosh Baruch Hu refused. Finally, B’nai Yisrael offered their children to secure their commitment to Torah. This Hashem accepted.</p>
<p>This Midrash appears to be derived from the verses leading up to the <em>na’aseh v’nishma</em> declaration. Following the second affirmation of na’aseh we are told <em>vayishalch es na’arei Yisrael</em> &#8211; that the youngsters of Bnai Yisrael were sent out to bring a sacrifice. Afterwards, Moshe sprinkled the blood on the <em>mizbeyach</em> and read the Torah to the people. Only now they proclaimed <em>na’aseh v’nishma. </em>Why? Initially Klal Yisrael felt <em>Matan Torah</em> was for adults only. For themselves they were ready to proclaim and commit to <em>na’aseh</em>, personal <em>mitzvah</em> observance. However, they soon recognized that it was the youth who successfully brought the <em>korban </em>needed to complete the <em>matan </em>Torah experience. Bnai Yisrael then offered their children as the guarantor of <em>Kabolas HaTorah. </em>As they did so, they came to the realization that <em>matan</em> Torah was not just for them but it was for their<em> kinderlach</em> and generations to come.</p>
<p>Now a process for <em>mesorah </em>would need to be established to assure the effective transmission of our holy Torah from generation to generation. Thus <em>na’aseh </em><em>v’nishma</em> was the call. Effective transmission of our <em>mesorah</em> calls for a commitment to doing and more importantly to hearing and learning! This awareness is critical for us to protect and assure the <em>mesorah</em> we guaranteed to our antecedents and that our children insure for us. Indeed, being <em>mikabelei </em>Torah and strengthening our link in the chain requires that we reclaim that <em>na’aseh v’nishma</em> attitude. No, it is not enough to send our children to <em>yeshiva</em>. We must do and we must learn . .  . . . . with our  children!</p>

<h2>Parshas Bo<br />
A Good Time</h2>
<p><em></em><em>Parshas Bo</em> heralds the birth of<em> </em><em>Klal Yisrael </em>as the <em></em><em>Am Segulah</em>. So profound are the events contained therein that they define our destiny as <em>banim la’Makom</em> till today. Most importantly, one detail in the <em>Parsha</em> is so fundamental that it singularly defines the spiritual mission of every Jew. Surprisingly; our <em>tachlis Hachayim</em> is not defined by the climactic conclusion of the <em>eser makkos</em>, the <em>korban Pesach</em> or even our physical exodus from <em>Mitzrayim</em>. Rather the essence of Klal Yisrael is wrapped in the ribbon of the very first Mitzvah gifted to us by Hashem Yisborach; the mitzvah of <em>Kiddush Hachodesh</em>.<span id="more-5089"></span></p>
<p>The Torah teaches us,<em> Hachodesh hazeh lachem. </em>This <em>posuk</em> Rashi points out, in the very first verse of <em>sefer Breishis</em>, is where the Torah should begin, s<em>hehi mitzvah rishona shenitztavu Yisrael. </em>Essentially, the Torah commences right here with <em>Kiddush Hachodesh, </em>a gift which is <em>lachem, </em>exclusively <em>Klal Yisrael’s</em> Why? And how does it define us <em>l’olmei olamim. </em></p>
<p><em>Kiddush Hachodesh</em>, our first national mitzvah is much more than the complex formulae to be used in calculating the lunar cycle. It is about time and our unique relationship to it. It is about <em>Kiddushas Hazman</em> and the ability of the <em>basor v’dam</em> to define it in this world and the next. Empowered by the <em>Ribbono Shel Olam</em>, as we are, to control time, even the <em>malachei hashareis</em> must consult <em>with B’nei  Yisrael </em>to know when the <em>Yomim Tovim</em> are scheduled!, We are charged to create <em>moadim</em>. Indeed, <em>Lakol zman va’eis,</em> we can create an <em>eis </em><em>la’ssos</em> for every opportunity. It is an amazing task that only a <em>Yid</em> can do. This is the Torah paradigm for <em>zman</em> – so lovingly placed in our hands as our first <em>mitzvah</em>. It is for us to give meaning and reality to each and every tick of the clock.</p>
<p><em>Mikadeish Yisrael v’hazmanim, </em> Kiddush Hachodesh is the very first national <em>mitzvah</em> and <em>kedushas hazman</em> is our national <em>tachlis</em>. Even before the actual <em>geulas Mitzrayim</em>, <em>Hashem Yisborach</em> is teaching us that it is up to us make each moment count. The gift of freedom is not for every individual to do what he wants when he wants. That is anarchy. Instead, time is life. And <em>cheirus</em> is the opportunity to use time well, to find in it a purpose and fill life with meaning.</p>
<p>Given the power of time and our responsibility to use it wisely it is no wonder that our national destiny begins with this very <em>mitzvah</em>. Its message is more critical today than ever. What do we do with our time? How much do we learn? Do we make time for our families?  Are we giving time back to the <em>klal</em>? How do we leisure? Do we invest time, find it, waste it or <em>r”l</em> try and kill it. It is, after all, our most precious resource and our most unique gift.</p>
<p>For Klal Yisrael, the ongoing epoch which began with Yitzias Mitzrayim and Matan Toarah and continues with our kiyum hamitzvos and limud Hatorah still today,  is all about time. Let us be devoted to using it well.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vaera<br />
Light Unto the Nations</h2>
<p>The devastation of Mitzrayim during the 10 plagues left the Egyptian landscape changed forever. Clearly the purpose of the <em>makkos</em>was not merely the exodus of Klal Yisrael from the tyrannical rule of Pharoah. After all, Hashem could have just escorted all the Jews out of Egypt in one fell swoop. What then was the objective of the 10 -step staged destruction of Egypt, its culture and people?</p>
<p>The Kli Yakar explains that the makkos were to provide a <em>tikkun</em> for the lack of <em>emuna</em> which was pervasive in the <em>Mitzri</em> culture. Pharoah denied Hashem’s existence and omnipotence. Pharoah tells Moshe, “I know not of Hashem, nor will I listen to Him.” Yet, as each plague descends upon Egypt, Pharaoh and the Mitzriyim are systematically and progressively shown that <em>Hashem Hu HaElokim, bashamayim u’varetz</em>! They have no choice but to recognize His <em>hashgacha</em> over all. As the <em>Yad Hashem</em> becomes ever clear with each and every plague the ultimate goal of the ten <em>makkos</em> is realized until it climaxes with the declaration <em>l’maan sapehr Sh&#8217;mi.<span id="more-5063"></span></em></p>
<p>Ultimately, Pharaoh and his people are taught that it is not merely enough to acknowledge the<em> Ribbono Shel Olam</em>’s presence in this world. We must do our best ”<em>l’maan sapehr Sh&#8217;mi</em>”- to proclaim His reality to all. Eventually the Egyptians got the point. Klal Yisrael is ejected from the throes of their servitude. <em>Geula</em> is at hand.</p>
<p>However, this lesson was not meant for the Mitzrim alone. It is really intended for us. With the revelation of Sinai close at hand, <em>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</em> was paving the way for the true purpose of <em>geula</em>; to become an “<em>ohr la’amim</em>,” a light to all nations. The soon to be experienced <em>Matan Torah</em>, would gift us with the tools for <em>Kiddush Shem Shamayim</em>, enabling us to be His ambassadors for <em>kedusha</em> in this world. Our awareness of <em>l’maan sapehr Sh&#8217;mi</em> and our commitment to implementing that attitude in each aspect of our lives, 24/7, is the final step in the preparatory process for redemption. It is an opportunity and responsibility for every ben and bas Yisrael which can bring the <em>geula</em> closer each day.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Vayechi<br />
Smile!</h2>
<p>As Yaakov Avinu blesses his children he describes each of their traits and challenges. On the one hand he encourages them and prods them to correct their errors, and on the other he identifies some of their unique <em>kochos</em> as he urges them to aspire to maximize their own individual potential. Interestingly, he doesn’t demand that they all be the same. The <em>shivtei kah</em> were each different, each with their own unique relationship with <em>Hakadosh Baruch Hu</em> and personal approach of <em>avodas</em> Hashem. In the totality of Klal Yisrael it is the sum total of our differences which maximize the <em>avoda</em> of the <em>klal</em> in our collective <em>avodas</em> Hashem. That is what is of supreme importance. Perish the thought of us all being the same and narrowing the venues for <em>hisgalus kvod shamayim</em> to a limited <em>mehalach hachayim</em> which embraces only a singular path. Klal Yisrael is stronger and mightier than that.<span id="more-5013"></span></p>
<p>Studying the brachos given by Yaakov Avinu to his twelve sons teaches us much about the breadth and diversity of our people. There is so much to learn from each <em>shevet</em> (and each other). One can even attempt to see where he or she fits in to the scheme of the fabric of <em>Am Yisrael</em> as defined by the birchas Yaakov. Indeed, we can find ourselves, our potential and our ability to give meaning to the <em>chol hayam</em> by understanding what we can be as <em>kochvei hashamayim</em>.</p>
<p>One especially poignant message is found in the <em>bracha</em> given to Yehuda. It provides us a paradigm for healthy leadership and for being the example to others each of us is expected to be.</p>
<p>As he completes defining the attributes of Yehuda’s leadership of <em>Malchus Bais Dovid</em>, Yaakov <em>bentches</em> Yehuda with the phrase, <em>chachleelee einayim miyayin uliven shinayim meichalav</em>, translated, Yaakov wished Yehuda that his eyes be red with wine and his teeth be white from milk. Mifarshim wonder what does it mean to have teeth whitened with milk. On a simplistic level, Yehuda’s being blessed that he will have large flocks of sheep and cattle which will give testimony to the promise of our living in a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<p>However, other mifarshim provide an amazing context. They say, one can see if someone’s eyes are red with wine by looking at them. But, how does one know if someone’s teeth are milk white? They answer, one only sees another’s teeth when that person smiles. This they say is the ultimate symbol of strength and royalty, to be a smiling king. A warm smile, is the attribute of great leaders as well. Effective leaders know that, amazingly, a smile is a language that even a baby understands. And a smile confuses an approaching frown &#8211; it is the curve that sets everything straight. After all, when one smiles at someone, that someone wants to smile back.</p>
<p>It is true that leaders must be strong like a lion and ready to be unyielding in the face of adversity. However, having those attributes without the noble, joyful smile of simcha and respect limits ones leadership and it’s potential to make a difference. A king, a leader must be confident in who he is and project the happiness and joy that only a smile can bring.</p>
<p>What a powerful lesson for us all. Whether we are acting as king of our castle or leading others (willingly or unwittingly) through our example, our effect is dependant on our affect. There is so much joy a smile can bring. And we can kaviyachol bring a smile to His lips by being that model of <em>malchus</em> to each other and the world at large that Yaakov intended.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Yaakov’s Shlomim</h2>
<p>Following the dramatic news of Yosef Hatzaddik’s survival in the flesh pots of Mitzrayim, Yaakov Avinu readies himself to visit his long lost son. With vigor and alacrity he packs his bags. Taking his entire family and all of his possessions in tow he head towards Be’er Sheva. Why Be’er Sheva? Chazal explain, it was years earlier that, “<em>vayeitzei Yaakov miBe’er Sheva</em>,” that Yaakov’s life travail from Lavan to Yosef commenced upon his departure from Beer Sheva. Now that his life had come full circle he went back to Be’er Sheva, to offer thanks to Hashem Yisborach in a <em>makom Tefilah</em> of his fathers, the place where it all began.</p>
<p>Energized with a renewed sense of <em>simchas hachyim,</em> Yaakov Avinu arrives in Be’er Sheva and immediately brings a <em>korban</em> of thanks to the <em>Ribbono Shel Olam</em>. However, unlike all <em>korbanos</em> offered heretofore, from the time of Noach and Avraham until this climactic moment, Yaakov does not bring a <em>korban Olah</em>, which is<em> kulo laHashem</em>. Rather, he offers <em>zevachim</em>, <em>shlomim</em> sacrifices. Offerings which are shared with and enjoyed by all. Interestingly, the Torah records that he offers them to the <em>Elokei</em> <em>Aviv</em> Yitzchok.</p>
<p><em>Mifarshei hamikrah</em> wonder; firstly, why <em>Shlomim</em>? Secondly, why not also mention <em>Elokei</em> Avraham as Yaakov had in the past? And finally, why wouldn’t one <em>korban</em> suffice, he obviously offered many animals (<em>zevachim</em>).<span id="more-4992"></span> One explanation provides us an extraordinary insight to golus in general and Yaakov Avinu’s persuit of <em>shlaimus</em> in particular. Perhaps it is a <em>remez</em> to the recipe for Geula as well.</p>
<p>The Ramban reminds us that Yitzchok Avinu represents <em>middas hadin</em>. He quotes the Midrash which teaches that Yaakov Avinu realized that with his impending descent to Mitzrayim the dreaded <em>golus</em> was about to begin. He feared for himself and his children. The total tragedy and devastation of the terror of golus could only be realized with the <em>middas hadin</em> (represented by Yitzchok Avinu) in full force. As such, Yaakov Avinu offered <em>shlomim</em> to the <em>Elokei Aviv Yitzchok</em>, to somehow sweeten the <em>middas hadin</em> through his offerings and thereby ensure Klal Yisrael’s ultimate survival through the darkness of golus that loomed ahead. Indeed, by being <em>matil shalom b’olam</em> with his <em>shlomim</em> offerings, the <em>middas harachamim</em> would be aroused. With H<em>akadosh Baurch Hu’s rachamim</em> ignited he could descend to Mitzrayim confident in Klal Yisrael’s future.</p>
<p>This was especially important to Yaakov Avinu who recognized that the descent of the <em>shivtei kah</em> to Mitzrayim started with the <em>kinah</em> of the brothers towards Yosef, an attitude that started with their perception of Yaakov’s playing favorite with his “<em>ben zekunim</em>.” Yaakov in his quest for <em>shlaimus</em> wanted a <em>tikkun</em> for this mistake. Thus the <em>tikkun</em> of his <em>shlomim</em> was personal and communal and he needed to offer at least two animals; one for himself and one for the <em>tzibbur</em>. Indeed, having come full circle, Yaakov wanted to be a <em>shaleim</em> thus <em>shalom</em> was priority number one.</p>
<p>This should not be lost upon us. The darkness of <em>golus</em> still engulfs us. We feel its pain in many ways. Yaakov Avinu taught us that he way to be <em>mamtik</em> the bitter days of exile is through multiple <em>shlomim</em>, creating a greater sense of harmony between each Yid and as a result between Klal Yisrael and <em>Avihem Shebashamayim</em>. The more we feel the <em>din</em> the more we need the <em>shlomim</em>. If one senses that klal Yisrael is feeling the pinch of <em>middas hadin</em> today, then Yaakov Avinu’s model should be our inspiration. We should be ambitious in being <em>marbeh shlomim</em> as <em>ohavei</em> and <em>rodfei shalom</em>! Perhaps this is one more reason why Parshas Vayigash is read immediately following the <em>chag</em> of Chanukah. With the<em> chag urim</em> just behind us we should not forget the Rambam’s concluding message of hilchos Chanukah where he states “<em>godol Hashalom shekol haTorah nitna la’asos shalom ba’olam”</em> It is Yaakov Avinu’s message to us as well. The only way to survive the dark days of golus is through being<em> marbeh shalom</em>. Let us do more. We can start today. In that zechus may we merit that the <em>oseh shalom bimromav</em> will be <em>yaaseh shalom aleinu</em> of <em>kol Yisrael bimhara biyameinu</em>, amen.</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayeshev<br />
Barasy Yetzer Hara, Barasy Torah Tavlin</h2>
<p>One of the many interesting story lines of Yosef Hatzadik’s experience of Parshas Vayeshev deals with his life as the chief of staff of Potifar. Yosef is appointed to be in charge of all of Potifar’s affairs and then we are told that Yosef was <em>yifei toar v’fei mareh</em>. The very next pasuk (39:7) tells us that all of the sudden the wife of Potifar set her sight to prey upon Yosef and place before him the ultimate test of his morality. Rashi presents the words of Chazal that teaches us that since Yosef was left in charge of Potifar’s estate he let it get to his head. He began to eat and drink and became preoccupied with his appearance. Thus, Hashem sent <em>eishes</em> Potifar to test him and remind him not to be haughty. Indeed soon there after, Yosef ended up back in prison.</p>
<p>The Netziv adds a vital insight to this lesson.<span id="more-4946"></span> The Natziv explains that typically a ben Torah can expect that the Torah will provide them some level of spiritual protection from the elements around them. The Torah, in telling us that Yosef was <em>yefei toa</em>r and <em>yfei mareh</em> is letting us know that the reason the Torah did not protect Yosef was because he wasn’t studying it enough. He wasn’t learning and as such there was no strength of Torah to protect him from nisayon. This lesson is critical.</p>
<p>Society at large can place many <em>nisyonos</em> from issues of morality, financial integrity, arrogance and pride. The Torah will only serve as a shield and protect us if we study it with intensity, consistency, passion and fervor. Baruch Hashem Yosef was able to pass the test, and as we learn later he went back to his learning. Those who don’t have Yosef’s strength of character should be reminded should be reminded to not get distracted in the priority of<em> talmid Torah kineged kulam</em>, whether at work and even in the bais medresh. Not only is the Torah the <em>tavlin</em> but it is the force field of protection which helps keep us safe from harm.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Toldos<br />
A Total Education</h2>
<p>The beginning of Parshas Toldos reintroduces us to the birth of Yitzchak Avinu as it begins to detail his legacy as a second of our avos. The Parsha begins <em>v’eileh toldos Yitzchok ben Avraham, Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em>. The commentaries wonder what the second half of this pasuk is teaching us since the verse already explained that Avraham was Yitzchok’s father. Rashi quotes the chazal which tells us that <em>Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em> is placed in the verse to teach us that Yitzchok looked exactly like his father and anyone who saw him knew that Avraham holid es Yitzchok, only Avraham can be his father (and not Avimelech, as the cynics of the generation had posited).</p>
<p>The Ibn Ezra takes a different approach. He explains the declaration that <em>Avraham holid es Yizchok</em> is referring to Yitzchok’s chinuch. Having fathered Yishmael, Avraham Avinu knew full well what it was like to have a child at risk. This time he took no chances. Not only did Avraham father Yitzchok but he also reared him to follow his teachings!<span id="more-4879"></span></p>
<p>In the nature versus nurture debate Avraham had discovered that both our needed. He thus faithfully transmitted all his values and priorities to Yitzchok his son. In every way Yitzchok was the physical and spiritual heir to Avraham Avinu. Similarly we are taught <em>kol milamid ben chaveiro kielu yaldo</em>. From the moment he was born, education, Yitzchok’s chinuch was Avraham Avinu’s full time preoccupation. He put all his <em>kochos leholid Yitzchok</em>, to guide, inspire and direct him on the path of greatness. And, with <em>siata dishmaya</em> he was blessed with success.</p>
<p>If we reflect back on nuances of the previous parsha leading up to and following Yitzchok’s birth we can mine some vital gems of chinuch priorities we can apply today. The Meforshim wonder what is the linkage between the destruction of Sedom and the <em>besurah tova</em> to Avraham and Sara that they will be blessed with a son? The three malachim traveled together, obviously there was a connection to their individual missions. Some explain first and foremost that Sedom had to be destroyed before Yitzchok could be born. There would be no way to rear a Yitzchok to the status of a <em>korban olah</em> with a Sedom in the environs. Thus when the malachim told Sara she would have a son they immediately set out to destroy that which could corrupt and derail all that Yitzchok could grow to be.</p>
<p>Avraham and Sarah understood this message and when the time came they exiled Yishmael from their home. A painful choice that with Hakadosh Baruch Hu’s blessing cleared the environment for Yitzchok to thrive. Even with his new beloved son growing up before his eyes, Avraham stuck to his own mission of outreach in kiruv. <em>Vayeeta eishal b’Vear Sheva</em>, and guest filled his home connecting to Hakadosh Baruch Hu (eishal was the acromyn for achila, shtiya velina). In this manner Yitzchok learned his <em>achrayus</em> to the klal and the need to spread the reality of Hashem Yisborach to a lost and pagan world.</p>
<p>Finally, after the <em>akaida</em> (22:19) Ibn Ezra wonders why the pasuk says vayashav Avraham el niarav, it seems that Avraham alone returned. Where was Yitzchok? The Ibn Ezra explains that following the <em>akaida</em>, the climactic moment of <em>gelui shchina</em> and <em>mesiras nefesh</em> when he was almost shechted, Yitzchok reached a tremendous <em>madraiga</em>. Avraham wanted to capitalize on the energy of the moment and therefore sent him to learn in the Yeshiva of Shem V’ever so that he could build on his inspiration and through <em>limud haTorah</em> to soar to even greater heights that would remain with him long after the inspiration had waned. <em>Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em>. He directed every aspect of his total development, <em>b’gashmius, b’ruchniyus, b’middos, b’mitzvos, b’yiras shamayim ub’limud haTorah</em>.</p>
<p>This message should never be lost upon us. Chinuch must be the full time preoccupation especially in our challenging environment where the elimination of the Sedom’s of our world are simply impossible. As such, we must be even more careful in providing balance between removing corrupting influences from our home (Yishmael) and providing healthy opportunities to see others not committed to our values but who we confidently bring under our sphere of influence without the fear that we will be corrupted by them. As careful as Avraham was with the chinuch of Yitzchok, he did not put his head in the sand nor completely isolate him from the world at large. Finally, we must show our children that Talmud Torah is <em>kineged kulam</em>. It is not enough to be inspired but we must live inspired. Therefore at the moments of great spiritual peeks we must look towards our learning to be the glue that enables us to hold onto that moment and maximize its impact each and every day.</p>
<p>Like Avraham we cannot have a <em>hesech hadaas</em> from the chinuch of our children. We can learn from him. Iy”H as our children grow it will be said of each of us that we were holid each of our offspring.</p>

<h2>Parshas Chayei Sara<br />
Ever Thankful</h2>
<p>One can help but be amazed by the amazing lessons for life taught to us by our avos and recorded for posterity as a <em>limud</em> for us throughout Sefer Bereishis. One phenomenal lesson is taught and reinforced again in Parshas Chaya Sara.</p>
<p>As Avraham laden with grief upon the passage of his beloved wife, Sarah Imanu, heads to Chevron to purchase to secure a burial place for Sarah Imanu. Filled with grief he approaches Bnei Cheis seeking to purchase the Mearas Hamachpayla. He explains his plight and the Bnei Cheis say to him, do not worry no one here will hold back in providing you a burial plot for your deceased. Efron too, the leader of the Bnei Cheis tells him<em> hasadeh nasatee</em> <em>lach</em>, the plot is yours<em>…k’vor meisecha</em>. Avraham’s response to their words and seeming benevolence is (23:12) <em>vayishtachu Avraham lifnei am haaretz</em>, Avraham bowed to the people.</p>
<p>The Medrish Raba uses this episode to teach a halacha and says <em>mikan lomdim shemodim al besurah tova</em>-we are supposed to give thanks on hearing good tidings. Interestingly, Avraham had not yet finished negotiating with Efron nor had he yet aquired the Mearas Hamachpayla still the very fact that he heard they were receptive to his idea was enough for him to bow and give thanks. Avraham was so conscious of expressing appreciation for everything that transpired that even in his grief while still an <em>onain</em> he stopped and gave thanks with the optimistic belief that things were going to work out.</p>
<p>This notion is so vital to the lessons of Parshas Chayei Sara that it is repeated again to let us know how crucial this attitude is to our outlook.<span id="more-4850"></span> Later on in the parsha we learn of Eliezer <em>eved</em> Avraham’s search for a wife for Yitzchok. He offers a tefilah to Hashem and asks that a test of a maiden giving him and his camels water be a siman min hashamayim of the perfect match for Yitzchok. Immediately upon concluding his supplication the famous story of Rivka at the well unfolds. After she finished watering his camels, Eliezer asks her- “who is your father?”, Rivka responds that she is the daughter of Besuel and she invites him to her father’s home. The Torah then declares, <em>vayikod haish vayishtachavu l’Hashem</em>. Eliezer bowed down to express appreciation to Hakadosh Baruch Hu for seeing his prayers beginning to be answered. On this pasuk the Medrish also says <em>mikan shemodim al besura tova</em>. Though similar to the story of Avraham and Bnei Cheis there are some slight differences which we must learn from. By Avraham Avinu it says not that he bowed to Hashem, just that he bowed. Eliezer on the other hand the Torah specifies he bowed to Hakadosh Baruch Hu. The underling message is powerful. Hodaah is due to people and to Hashem Yisborach for all the good that takes place in our life…even the good things that have not yet happened!</p>
<p>Moreover, there is never a moment in time when expressing <em>hodaah</em> should be difficult. Avraham needed to bury Sarah-he was in mourning, but he found the time to be grateful. Eliezer in a foreign country with a mission to hastly accomplish took the time to be grateful. He wasn’t in too much of a hurry to say thanks to Hashem Yisbarach for putting him in the right place at the right time. In addition, we must also explore the context of these declarations of hodaah. Avraham Avinu took the time to express appreciation at the end of Sarah sojourn on this earth as he himself too entered his twilight years having been blessed bakol. Eliezer on the other hand expresses hodaah at the prospect of having found a wife for Yitzchok who would now be able to begin living his life <em>beshleimus</em> with his <em>bashert</em> Rivka Imanu. It is never too early and never too late to be thankful.</p>
<p>These lessons should not be lost upon us. So many of us feel the pain of loss and bereft of comfort from recent tragedies that have plagued our people. Nevertheless, we must reach down deep beyond our suffering and follow the example of Avraham Avinu. We must find our way to look beyond the pain and tragedy and be thankful for even a <em>besura tova</em>, a seemingly little thing that has not yet come to fruition, even the grief is still fresh upon us. In that zechus of finding the way to be maker tov to the Ribono Shel Olam like Avraham <em>beshaas evel</em>, may we be <em>zoche</em> to have the opportunity to be maker tov to Hakadosh Baruch Hu like Eliezer eved Avraham, out of simcha and joy of <em>kol sasson vekol simcha kal chason vekol kallah kol omrim hodu es Hashem…ki leolam chasdo</em>.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parsha Vayeira<br />
Elokim Imcha</h2>
<p>Nestled within the many lessons of Parshas Vayera is an amazing insight into the nature of the relationship between Hakadosh Baruch Hu and klal Yisrael. It is a yesod which should inspire us. It is a lesson which emanates from the second interaction between Avimelech Melech Plishtim and Avraham Avinu. Let us investigate.</p>
<p>Subsequent to Avraham Avinu’s departure from the land of the Plishtim, he once again encounters Avimelech and Phichol his chief of staff who wish to make a treaty with him. They justify their pursuit of this pact with Avraham Avinu by declaring (21:22)<em> Elokim imcha bechol asher ata oseh</em>. Seemingly, this means that they noted in Avraham Avinu that he was blessed with siyata deShmaya and that Hakadosh Baruch Hu was with him in all his endeavors. This of course was true. Avraham Avinu had survived the kivshon ha’esh, defeated Nimrod/Amrafel, emerged unscathed from Sedom, had amassed incredible wealth and now, in his old age, he and Sarah Imeinu were blessed with a son, Yitzchok.</p>
<p>Indeed, Avraham Avinu was blessed with a tremendous amount of siyata deShmaya and was recognized as the n’see Elokim wherever he went. Avimelech, Melech Plishtim, wanted to tap in to that success that was reflected in the life and accomplishments of Avraham Avinu. Sure enough, with singing of their treaty, Avraham Avinu spent yamim rabim (21:34) in the environs of Eretz Plishtim generating success for not only himself, but, for Avimelech and his countrymen.</p>
<p>The Malbim however places a slightly different spin in understanding Avimelech’s perspective and what motivated him to seek this accord with Avraham Avinu.<span id="more-4827"></span> According to the Malbim, it was not merely that Avimelech viewed Avraham Avinu as one who was blessed with incredible siyata dishmaya who lived a G-dly, spiritual life, rather Avimelech saw “<em>Elokim imcha bechol asher ata oseh</em>” &#8211; <em>ratza lomar she’ain maasecha nimshachim el gezaras haElokim</em>, it is not that you, Avraham, are following the decrees of Hashem, <em>rak ritzono haElokim nimshach achar maasecha</em>, rather, Hashem’s decrees are based on your actions. In other words, Avimelech was able to detect that not only did Avraham do Hashem’s will, but Hashem did Avraham’s will, too! What an observation.</p>
<p>This yisod is more than just an application of the concept of <em>tsadik gozer veHaksadosh Baruch Hu mikayim</em>. Rather, it reflects the power imbued to us to be able to, kaviyachol direct G-d’s will through our actions! Amazingly, we are empowered by the choices we make to influence the ratzon Hashem. It is a privilege and a power not to be taken lightly.  What a gift, what an opportunity and what a responsibility. Hashem Yisborach trusts us to make the correct decision. He gives us the tools and then lets us decide. When we choose well we are not only blessed with siyata diShmaya but we can climb the ladder of aliya ruchanis to reach the madreiga where the ratzon HaElokim will be, <em>nimshach achar maasenu</em>, and ultimately be determined by us!</p>
<p><em>Merubim tzarchei amcha</em>, with Klal Yisrael needing so much let us not have <em>daas ketzara</em>. Rather, let us be aware that we can “inspire” the Melech Malchei Hamlachim to do our will if we but, <em>asei ritzoneinu kirtzono</em>. We, too, can follow the example of Avraham Avinu and influence, through our actions, the ratzon Hashem to answer our prayers and bring the ultimate geulah to a rapid reality. The power in is on our hands.</p>

<p>In Parshas Lech Lecha we are told how Avraham Avinu is taken outside by the Ribbono Shel Olam and told to look towards the heavens and count the stars. He is then blessed, <em>ko yiheye zarecha </em>that his offspring (we, <em>bnei Yisrael</em>) will be like the stars and the heaven. The next <em>posuk</em> tells us <em>v’heemin baHashem</em>, that Avraham believed in Hakadosh Baruch Hu, <em>vayachshiveha lo tzedaka</em> and he considered it a <em>tzekada</em>. Miforshim wonder and debate about whom this phrase is discussing. Was it Avraham who considered it a <em>chessed</em> of Hashem to be promised offspring who would be like the stars or was is it Hakadosh Baruch Hu who found it an act of <em>tzeddek</em> &#8211; righteousness on behalf of Avraham Avinu who was heemin baHashem, a believer that Hakadosh Baruch Hu would keep His promise of children, grandchildren and generations of Yiddin who would illuminate the world like the “stars of the heaven.”</p>
<p>Rashi explains that it was Hakadosh Baruch Hu that thought it was exceptional that Avraham believed him even though he had not yet fathered a child. The Ramban however takes the opposite view and says that Avraham considered it a kindness, an act of tzedaka by the Ribbono Shel Olam, to even consider promising him a child and a family. In his modesty he felt himself perhaps unworthy of such a <em>chessed</em>. True he had followed Hashem Yisborach’s instructions to leave his home town and travel to Eretz Yisrael and he had done whatever Hakadosh Baruch Hu had expected of him. Nevertheless, to Avraham Avinu, nothing was a given. It was all a gift.<span id="more-4778"></span></p>
<p>This <em>yesod</em> should not be lost upon us. When we stop and think, we too, can come to realize that nothing is a given. It is all a gift.</p>
<p>The blessings of family, success and good fortune are not something we deserve, even if we think we’ve earned them. We must be ever cognizant of the fact that Hashem Yisboach owes us nothing and we owe Him everything. So much of the petty pain and suffering people inflict upon each other is due to forgetting this point. We expect things to go our way, we expect a certain amount of respect. We expect to be valued and not to be taken for granted. We even expect that things will be easy and that our life will be filled with comfort and calm. We expect it all. Indeed, we are filled with great expectations.</p>
<p>We pray for <em>bracha</em>. Often times, those prayers are answered. But, lest we forget where all goodness comes from, Avraham Avinu reminds us, says the Ramban, to step back and remember, it is all a gift and we should appreciate it. As such, we should be extra careful to always be thankful and appreciative of what Hashem Yisborach has sent our way. We can and should show that gratitude in so many ways through our <em>limud</em> haTorah, <em>kiyum hamitzvos</em>, <em>iyun tefilah</em>, giving of <em>tzedakah</em> and <em>ridifas</em> <em>hachessed </em>as we always remember,  nothing is a given, it is all a gift!</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Nitzavim Vayeilech<br />
Not a Jealous Bone</h2>
<p>As Sefer Devarim draws to a close Moshe Rabbeinu delivers his last words and testament to the Jewish people. As he approaches his final day, we cannot help but wonder what was going through Moshe Rabbeinu’s mind the last day of his life. One yesod is so poignant it must be repeated.</p>
<p>The Midrash Rabba in Parshas Vayeleich articulates how Moshe Rabeinu greatly desired to prolong and stave off his ultimate appointment with the Malach Hamaves. He busied himself with tzarchei tsibur, wrote twelve sifrei Torah and deflected the Malach Hamaves in his mission. In a way, he was burning with confidence that perhaps the gezayra of his demise would be annulled. Staying busy on behalf of the Klal and teaching Torah would surely keep the dreaded shlucho shel makom at bay. And it did. With the Malach Hamaves repulsed by Moshe Rabeinu’s limud haTorah, Hakadosh Baruch Hu so to speak had to employ an alternative strategy to bring Moshe Rabeinu’s neshama back home. In fact the Ribbono Shel Olam, Kaviyachol, took the mission upon Himself.<span id="more-4664"></span></p>
<p>Instead of the Malach Hamaves taking Moshe Rabeinu’s neshama, Hashem Yisborach, seemingly, listened to Moshe Rabeinu’s request for continued life even if he would no longer be the teacher of Am Yisrael. At Moshe’s behest, He had Moshe switch roles with his devoted talmid Yehoshua. Together Yehoshua on the right, and Moshe on the left, signifying Yehoshua’s new leadership for klal Yisrael, they approached the Ohel Moed. They entered inside and the anan of the Shechina descended over Yehoshua in his first communion with the Ribono Shel Olam as the newly appointed melamed Torah le’amo Yisrael.</p>
<p>After the Shechina departed, Moshe turned to Yehoshua, his faithful student, and asked him – “what did Hakadosh Baruch Hu tell you?” Yehoshua responded “when the Shechina was upon you was I given permission to know what Hashem spoke to you? I too cannot reveal what it was that Hashem said to me.” At that very moment explains the Midrash, tza’ak Moshe ve’amar, meiah misos v’lo kina achas &#8211; I would rather one hundred deaths than even one moment of jealousy! And he immediately submitted himself to the gezeira of his passing. Moshe Rabbeinu did not want to experience even one jealous bone in his body.</p>
<p>What a powerful lesson. Moshe Rabeinu preferred his own demise rather than covet that which belonged to others. The most modest of men would not let that which is motzi es ha’adam min haolam sully his very core. He would leave this world untainted, taken b’nishika and not via the ugly middah of jealousy.</p>
<p>From the sad saga of Kayin and Hevel to the divisive rebellion of Korach, the murder, machlokes and suffering brought about by kina have scarred our people for generations. Ugly competition, vindictive cattiness, painful bullying and hurtful disloyalty to our brothers and sisters is the natural outgrowth of the horrible trait. Indeed, jealousy is a midah which is so pernicious it can quickly and easily creep into our every endeavor. Rather than being victimized by its venomous and corrupting tentacles, we must learn from Moshe Rabbeinu to run from its grasp and prevent it from entering out heart and mind. To do so we must joyfully appreciate each moment Hashem Yisborach has granted us and view all we have been blessed with in this world as a gift emanating from His love!</p>
<p>As we prepare ourselves for the yemei hadin and react to people, events and things in the workplace, conversations at home and our interactions with neighbors we must strive to measure our behavior against the standard of Moshe Rabbeinu who teaches; better a thousand deaths than a moment of jealous envy. We can work to eradicate kina of what we desire of others. In so doing we can merit a year of bracha, nachas and kol tuv as we make ourselves the kaylim for the birchos Hashem which are sure to follow.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em><br />
</span></p>
<h2>Parshas Ki Savo<br />
Lofty Aspirations</h2>
<p>Following the ghastly klalos of the tochacha Moshe Rabenu reassures Klal Yisrael of their eternity. He inspires them by reminding them of Hakadosh Baruch Hu’s care and concern for us as He took us out of Mitzrayim. He then adds an enigmatic phrase. As Moshe declares in (29:3), “Velo nasan Hashem lachem lev ladaas veanayim leros veaznayim leshmoa ad hayom hazeh”.</p>
<p>Essentially, Moshe declares that until that moment in time Klal Yisrael had not borne witness or confirmed their commitment to Torah and the ability to appreciate the chessed of the Ribono Shel Olam until that very moment.</p>
<p>This is a puzzling refrain. We had said naaseh venishma forty years earlier. Moreover, we had followed the ananei hakavod and the nightly pillar of fire in the midbar for forty years. We had experienced matan Torah, seen wondrous miracles and readied ourselves to enter in Eretz Yisroel. Could it be that only now, just days before Moshe Rabenu’s death that Klal Yisrael was acknowledged for their acceptance of their commitments to Torah, avoda and gemilus chassadim? Is it really true that ad hayom hazeh Klal Yisrael was deficient in their appreciation of Hashem?<span id="more-4618"></span></p>
<p>Rashi too is bothered by this perplexing statement and provides us an insight that is amazing. Rashi teaches us his mesorah, that on that day, Moshe Rabeinu wrote the “official” copy of the Torah. This original text was entrusted to Shevet Levi who were to safeguard it for eternity as it would serve as the original document in which all of the sifrei Torah in the future would be redacted. When klal Yisrael observed that this original Torah was being given to Shevet Levi they complained to Moshe how can you give the Torah only to your shevet, it is a morasha to us too? When Moshe Rabbeinu heard that klal Yisrael was complaining that somebody else was receiving the Torah he rejoiced and said “now I realize that you truly desire to serve Hashem”.</p>
<p>We learn from here a valuable lesson. So much of who we are and what defines us is determined by what we aspire for. Even more telling is what makes us jealous and the things we covet in others. When klal Yisrael coveted Torah, Moshe Rabeinu knew that’s what defined us.</p>
<p>The same is true with us today. If all we seek is wealth, fame and fortune then that defines what we are. But if our drive and commitment is for Torah and mitzvos, if in fact we want to grow and become even closer to Hakadosh Baruch Hu then that defines us too.</p>
<p>Yehi ratzon that we be blessed sheyimalei mishalos lebaynu letova as we want the right things and they become us, as we become them for a year filled with health, happiness and joy.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Ki Seitzei<br />
Honesty Counts</h2>
<p>Parshas Ki Seitzei is jam packed with mitzvos. Interestingly, it concludes with two seemingly unrelated mitzvos, the halachos of honest weights and measures and the requirement to remember what Amalek did to us when he attacked us following our geula from Mitzrayim. The smichos haparshiyos leaves a powerful reminder.</p>
<p>Chazal point out the obvious relationship between these two mitzvos. Simply, when yidden are honest Amalek has no shlitah. Honesty is always reflection for our bitachon in haKadosh Baruch Hu. Amalek only attacks when we are ayaf veyagaya velo yarey Elokim. As such, maintaining integrity in our business affairs is crucial. As it not only reflects our emuna, but it is the best preventive medicine we can employ to keep Amalek away.</p>
<p>But there is more.<span id="more-4589"></span> The pasuk expands the description of the unscrupulous business man and calls kol osei avel, all those who behave badly as deserving of the same consequences as those who are dishonest. In fact, the Sifrei darshans that these people are defined with five uncomplimentary terms; avel, sanui, meshukatz, cheirem and toeiva. These are very powerful words characterizing those who take advantage of others for personal gain. The implication is self explanatory. Those who wish not to be called a toeiva should exercise caution and propriety to be able to answer the question of nasasa venatata beemuna positively.</p>
<p>The Malbim takes it a step further. He understands these five descriptors from avel to toeiva as a progression. One leads to the other. When an individual has a breakdown in his business ethics, then he is more than at risk for having a breakdown in other areas of his mitzvah observance. He is on the fast track to “toeiva-hood”, being an abomination in the eyes of Hashem for all sorts of disgusting behavior. Cheating can lead even to murder once the breakdown in ethical behavior begins.</p>
<p>This message need not be lost during the month of Elul. Small failures in ethical behavior create large chasms of spiritual deficit.</p>
<p>The opposite is also true. Working on our integrity we can help shut down the access to all that is evil and make it easier to refine our character in avodas Hashem. This idea is part of what we remember when we are mekayem the mitzvah of zachor es asher asa lecha Amalek. It is why it is one of the shesh zichronos. We not only remember what Amalek did, but we remind ourselves of what invites his behavior.</p>
<p>May we be zoche to be inspired so that our ethical conduct is always above reproach. Leman yareechun yamecha and be blessed with the areechas yamim that the Torah promises to all those who are honest.</p>

<p><span style="color: #888888;"><em>A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Shoftim<br />
Tamim Tehiyeh</h2>
<p>As Moshe Rabbeinu continues his admonition of Klal Yisrael we are reminded once again of the powerful legacy and commitments of our people. Indeed our connection to the past is the guarantee for our future. And so Moshe Rabbeinu invokes the call put forth to Avraham Avinu who was told by the Ribbono Shel Olam <em>his&#8217;haleich lifanai v’heyei tamim</em> &#8211; walk with Hashem and be pure of faith. As Moshe Rabbeinu continues his epitaph he challenges us to ascend that same mountain of emunah like our patriarch by declaring <em>tamim tehiyeh im Hashem Elokecha &#8211;</em> be pure in your faith of Hashem. As we know, Avraham Avinu heeded that call and so can we. In fact, as we will soon see, our relationship with Hashem Yisborach and all of His blessing depends on it.</p>
<p>Almost all the mifarshei hamikrah lend their hand at helping us derive a sense of clarity to this command which the Ramban clearly elucidate as a mitzvas asei.<span id="more-4566"></span> Rashi points out simply that we are to walk with Hashem b’temminus. Our relationship with Hakadosh Baruch Hu should be unassuming &#8211; after all, He knows best. Moreover says Rashi we should be mitzapeh lo – we should be seeking Him (and not others) for guidance, hope and salvation. And finally Rashi explains Moshe Rabbeinu’s challenge to mean, kol mahsheyavo alecha kabel b’temmimums – that we must accept Hashem Yisborach as the ultimate master of our destiny. As such, whatever befalls us we should accept with a pure heart. Only then will we be amo his people and chelko His portion. According to Rashi our national destiny, living as His people, is linked to the fulfillment of this mitzvah. We are expected to place our full faith and trust in Him.</p>
<p>Recently, Klal Yisrael has experienced numerous tragedies, dangers, as well as, a conglomerate of “natural disasters” ranging from earthquakes to hurricanes. These traumas have shaken us to our very core. Some have attempted to justify or determine a quid pro quo for the cause of these events by asserting opinions as to why Hashem Yisbarach has done what he did (as if mortal man could know). This is a dangerous practice and one which is completely contrary to the admonition of Moshe Rabainu, tammim tehiyeh im Hashem Elokecha, as explained by Rashi above. Instead of trying to guess what and why Hashem Yisborach is doing, we should just place our trust in Him and be confident that He knows best.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Ramban adds another nuance to our understanding of this critical mitzvas asei. He explains that we must acknowledge and accept that EVERYTHING, all the patterns of nature and the power of our own creativity, indeed the entire world and our future destiny is in His hands. Ki hu Elokai haElokim elyon al hakol. But there is a caveat. While it is true that hakol biydei Shamayim, nevertheless, <em>kol haba’os tehiyenah kifi hiskareiv Eilav</em>! All that will transpire is a direct reflection of the closeness of our relationship with Him, the Ribbono Shel Olam. Yes, all is the Yad Hashem &#8211; but what that Yad delivers, is up to us. The only quid pro quo regarding Hashem Yisborach’s hashgacha and what happens in the world around us is related to our personal connection with Kaviyachol the Ribbono Shel Olam. <em>U’lifichach achar ha’azharos ha’eilu amer sheyehe tamim im Hashem</em>! Indeed, the more deeply and purely (like a seh tamim) that we connect and relate to Him, give ourselves up to Him, make his mitzvos more real, His Torah more vivid and His relationship with us more personal, the more we can count on feeling more of His closeness to us.</p>
<p>Hishaleich lifanei v’hetei Tamim, the past is behind us and our future is ahead, but the present is now!</p>
<p>Tamim tehiyeh im Hashem Elokecha. This mitzvah always accompanies the beginning of chodesh Elul, the month of ani lidodi vdodi li. They go hand in hand. We know that if we turn our hearts to Kaviyachol He will turn His heart to us. Chazal remind us, <em>dirshu Hashem bihamatzo</em>. The <em>yemei ratzon</em> have arrived. As we hearken to the shofar and prepare ourselves for the <em>Yemei Hadin</em> let us remember that so much of what will be is up to us as individuals and as a klal. Let us resolve to maximize the potential of this Mitzvah and strive to walk with Hashem Yisborach <em>b&#8217;temimus</em> as Avraham Avinu did. We question not the past and we dare not predict the future. Rather,we steadfastly commit ourselves to serve Him with our entire being right here, right now.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we serve Hakadosh Baruch Hu, b&#8217;temimus, in the present for an entire Elul, Iy”H we will merit as a result a year filled with bracha and hatzlacha <em>sheyimaleh kol mishakos libeinu litova</em>.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Pinchas<br />
Yismach Yisrael!</h2>
<p>The Baal HaTurim on Chumash is famous for his gematrious and relational analysis to common phrases and words in the Torah. In addition, he often adds subtle nuances of insight and observation which illuminate our perspective on poignant issues of hanhaga and hashkafa. These cannot be overlooked. One such subtlety is found at the beginning of this week’s parsha. It’s message is especially poignant in light of current events which have shaken the very core of the Jewish community.</p>
<p>The third posuk of the parsha details how in light of Pinchos’ act of kanaous, Hashem Yisborach declares, Hinini noseion lo es brisi Shalom.<span id="more-4440"></span> The letter vav in the word shalom is written with a break in its vertical length. It is ironic that the word which represents a sense of shalem, wholesomeness, is itself split and divided. Why? Chazal and the miforshei hamikrah offer many insights into this unusual requirement for the writing of the word Shalom in the parsha. One of the insights taught by the Baal Haturim points out that the split vav is the reward of the bris shalom given to Pinchos. It is related to the fact the Pinchos is indeed Eliyahu Hanavi, who will be mevaser the geula b’karov. What is the connection? The Baal Haturim continues to explain that the letter vav was taken from Eliyahu (Pinchos) (heini anochi sholeach lachem es Eliya Hanavi) by Yaakov Avinu. It was added to his own name (v’zacharti es brisi Yaakov, hinini shav shvus ahalei Yaakov written malei with a vav) as a mashkon to secure the arrival of Mashiach. Yaakov Avinu will only return it when Eliyahu Hanavi finally delivers Mashiach to Bnai Yisrael, b’karov.</p>
<p>This quixotic insight is fascinating enough but then the Baal Haturim adds a nuance. He says that this concept is the essence of yagel Yaakov and yismach Yisrael. Why? Yismach shares the exact same letters as the word moshiach. Furthermore, the word Shalom and the phrase zehu Moshiach have the same gematria. Clearly the Baal Haturim is sharing with us a deep concept relating simcha to our ultimate tachlis. Indeed, there is a profound relationship between simcha and our achieving the spiritual nirvana which moshiach will bring. The totality of shalom, true peace, an inner sense of spiritual accomplishment, satisfaction and tranquility, can only come about when we are being oveid Hashem, haMelech she’hashlom shelo, b’Simcha. Without it there is a divide in the shelamos we seek to accomplish. Though seemingly small this break creates a giant chasm separating us from our goal of shelamus, perfection. And at its worst, it wreaks havoc upon us, tachas asher lo avadita es Hashem Elokecha b’isimcha, as it fosters our national devastation.</p>
<p>Despite the sadness of current events and the impending seasonal sorrow of the three weeks we can resolve to help put the vav in the Bris Shalom back together. We must. The formula is the same.</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>Yismach Yisrael! Indeed, to reconnect the two halves of this vav, we must learn to be happy and relish the gift of goodness the Eibeshter showers upon us each day. That is the message of the baal haTurim. From the gift of family, health and to life itself, we certainly cannot take any of them for granted. Every moment of life, whether we are merely eight years or one hundred years old is to be treasured. How sadly we have witnessed that, instantaneously, it all can change. One broken vav can destroy a life and tear apart a family as it traumatizes a community. Being thankful to Him, feeling privilege to be doing His will and feeling excited for the opportunities He provides is one way to heal and reunite that vav. Look back over the past few days and see how a community united made that vav complete. Somehow we had a glimpse of a Moshiach moment as saw beyond that what divides us and reconnected to each other through and with a common mission and united sense of purpose. Find the joy in that unity. It is the reaction He is (kaviyachol) yearning for and it is a balm that we can use to wipe away our bitter tears.</p>
<p>Retain the images of a sea of humanity joined in unison. Kish echad blev echad. Consider always, that Hashem Yisborach took the time, so to speak, to consider us and fashion each individual and their unique combination of talent, personality and character, then we can surlely feel glad for the gift of life and hopefully use it well.</p>
<p>Through achdus we can connect and correct the Simcha quotient in our avodas Hashem. By so doing, we can repair the fractured vav of Shalom we so desperately need. It is our challenge and opportunity. Yismach Yisrael even when the sun is behind the darkest of clouds – Moshiach awaits us!</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></em></p>
<h2>Parshas Bamidbar<br />
S’ooh Es Rosh</h2>
<p>Parshas Bamidar is read annually the weeks preceding Shavuos. Chazal deemed its lesson a vital prerequisite to Kabbalas Hatorah always. One important message is found at the beginning of the Sedra. The parsha begins with Hashem Yisborach commanding Moshe Rabbeinu and his brother Aharon Hakohein to count Klal Yisrael. Rashi quotes the Midrash which says that <em>“mitoch chibasan lifanav moneh osam” </em>“due to Hashem Yisborach’s love for us He counts us all the time”. This concept is inspiring. It reminds us that we are not only exhorted to love Hashem, but that He treasures each of us. He loves us back! Indeed, it was this Ahava that was cemented at Matan Torah. Hashem then designated us as the Ohr Laamim, beacons of the Shechina, enlightening the entire world.<span id="more-4281"></span></p>
<p>The Midrashim point out that the command to count Klal Yisrael is introduced with the word, <em>“s’ooh”</em> &#8211; which means to lift up or elevate. Indeed, the word <em>s’ooh</em> shares a common root with the word <em>nasi</em>&#8211; prince. It reflects nobility, a royalty born of our potential to grow from the average to the league of elite! Moshe Rabbeinu was told, “<em>amar Hakadosh Baruch Hu – Moshe, kol mah she’ata yochol l’romeim es hauma hazu – rommimah!”</em> (psikta Rabsi perek 10) <em>All that you can do to elevate Klal Yisroel, put into action</em>! That is the essence of leadership. <em>S’ooh es rosh</em> &#8211; our leaders do not merely count us with the intention of realizing a census. Rather, they raise us up, uplift each of our souls and inspire us toward our potential.</p>
<p>This is a powerful message of leadership and love which we can apply to our own family and friends. Each of us finds him or herself in a leadership role quite often. These are opportunities for <em>s’ooh es rosh</em>, to bring out the best in others. At home, too, as leaders of a household, we extol the love we have for our children. In so doing, we mustn’t only look back at the gifts of nachas they have brought us, but we must lift them up and inspire them for the future. We can let our young children know that we see and appreciate the regal attributes which make them each unique. Children so loved will then be equipped to be mikablei Torah, confident of the mission they alone can achieve.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Bichukosei<br />
Standing Proud</h2>
<p>Parshas Bechukosai commences with the hope and promise of birchos Hashem. All that is expected of us is <em>bichukosai teilechu</em> – <em>shthiyu ameilim baTorah</em>, that we should toil in Torah and Hashem’s bountiful blessings are bestowed upon us. The Brochos, however, are immediately followed by the Tochacha. Sadly, Klal Yisrael knows the trauma and tragedy of this Parsha too well. The highs and lows of our history are painted with suffering throughout the ages. With so much bracha tobe had, we must explore, where does tragedy begin and how b’ezras Hashem can it be prevented. Perhaps the smichus haparshiyos gives us clue.<span id="more-4253"></span></p>
<p>The opening brachos of the Parsha conclude with the words <em>v’oleich eschem kommimiyus</em>, explains Rashi – I will accompany you <em>b’kumah zkufah</em> with an upright posture, a proud and regal way of carrying oneself. Indeed, when all is well with Kallal Yisrael, this is the climax of birchos Shamayim, the ultimate bracha – to be able to walk nobly and proudly as an oveid Hashem. Nothing could be greater. However, this posuk is followed by the unfortunate statement of the very next verse, <em>v’im lo sishmu li</em> – if you will not listen to me. Suddenly, tragedy begins. Why? Where is the transition from Bracha to klalla. How did we go from <em>bichukosei teleichu</em>, walking with Hashem Yisborach to r”l, <em>lo sishmu,</em> to not listening.</p>
<p>Perhaps the <em>smichas hapsukim</em> is telling us that the barometer of our strength or our demise lies in the sense of <em>Kommiyus </em>– <em>the kuma zkufa,</em> the noble pride we have in our mitzvah observance. When we stand proud of our yiddishkeit and derive dignity and delight in doing His will, we stand tall. All of His Brachos are ours! It is only when there is a break-down, however small it begins, in our sense of the nobility of being the Am Segula that the – the refrain of <em>lo sishnu </em>begins to creep in. A proud Jew listens to the Ribbono Shel Olam and kivayachol partners with Him in being an ohr La’amim. It is role to be proud of. Only the Jew who lacks pride begins to distance himself from the warm embrace of Hashem Yisborach, His Torah and His Mitzvos. By instilling a sense of <em>ashrienu mah tov chelkeinu</em> in our a kiyum hamitzvos our children too will feel that gisdhmak we have in doing the ratzon Hahshem. With joy and with pride we can keep <em>im lo sihmu</em> at bay.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Ma Inyan Shmitta Eitzel har Sinai<br />
Parshas Behar</h2>
<p>The first section of parshas Behar deals with the laws of Shmittah. We are told vayidaber Hashem el Moshe B’har Sinai &#8211; that Hashem spoke to Moshe Behar Sinai, at Mount Sinai. Rashi immediately introduces us to the famous exclamation of Chazal as he quotes Toras Kohanim which asks, Ma inyan shmitta eitzel Har Sinai? What do the Shmitta laws have to do with Sinai (more than any other Halacha). Chazal respond, just as each and every detail of hilchos Shmitta is of Sinaitic origin, so too, are all the laws of the Torah.<span id="more-4215"></span></p>
<p>This in and of itself is a vital lesson. The authenticity of our mesorah must never be challenged. Every word of Torah, each statement of Chazal, and every phrase of Shulchan Aruch is part of the rich treasure of Toras Eloka Mimaal gifted to us, His am segulah at matan Torah. All of Torah is real in the most absolute sense of the word. Those who doubt r”l are cast as heretics deserving no place in olam haba’ah.</p>
<p>Yet there is an even deeper insight worth exploring as we relate our overall mesorah and kiyum hamitzvos to the essence of the Shmitta observance. Dovid Hamelech said in regard to shomrei shvi’is, Giborei koach oseh divaro – Men of strength do His will. At first glance it is puzzling. What is so impressive and admirable about not going to work? Many people dream of such an opportunity! With the bounty of the sixth year a harbinger of good fortune and plenty to hold them over through the harvest of the eighth years’ crop, one could easily go forward without a worry. Where is the gevurah that is is so strongly praised?</p>
<p>The answer sheds a fascinating light on human nature and provides us another mihalach in understanding Ma inyan shmitta eitzel Har Sinai. Chazal knew better than anyone the nature of the human psyche. True, there was enough food in the pantry to last as long as needed. But people always want more, another dollar in the bank, a little more financial security, and a little more kochi v’otzem yadi. It is just too painful to walk by a fallow field that could be producing another crop. It is not enough to have enough; the typical person wants more. Herein enters the most important middah upon which kol hatorah kulah is predicated. It is the lesson of self discipline. Eizeh hu gibor, ha kovesh es yitzro. Indeed, it is only the gibor koach, who is  oseh devaroh and does not follow aitzas yitzro. Shmitta is all about self-discipline and self-control. It is about giving ourselves up to the Ribbono Shel Olam with a sense of total dependency, security and serenity. It is about our knowing that He knows what is best for us and our families. With that level of bitachon we can scale the loftiest heights of Emuna and be zoche to dveikus baShechina in all that we do. It is a maxim we can strive for each day.</p>
<p>Ma inyan shmitta eitzel Har Sinai? &#8230;. Everything.</p>
<p>Kol haTorah kulah is about self-discipline and self control. By mastering that middah we can be zoche to a true kabbolas Hatorah at Shavuos time this year.</p>

<h2>Parshas Kedoshim<br />
Elohei Masecha</h2>
<p>Parshas Kedoshim is chockful of Mitzvos, all of which direct us toward the goal of living a Torah life imbued with the mantra of Kedoshim Tihiyu. At first glance, one such Mitzvah seems so easy, yet, according to the Ohr Hachayim Hakodesh, it is a constant struggle. Indeed, it is a Mitzvah which expands or r”l constrains our Kedushah potential. It is the Mitzvah of elohei maseicha lo sa’aseh lach.</p>
<p>Most of the mifarshei hamikrah focus this commandment on the azahara to not even fashion idols for others. However, with the Yetzer Harah for idolatry neutered by Chazal, we find the whole notion of idolatry repugnant, even silly. Furthermore, as the Ohr Hachayim Hakadosh points out, this issur is already included in the general Halachos of avoda zara. He therefore renders a different approach that is especially inspirational during this sefira season.<span id="more-4190"></span></p>
<p>He explains, “when a person performs a mitzvah, the Shechina rests upon him. But when one r”l does an aveira, a ruach tumah sets upon him  – v’hu masach hamavdil beino uvein Elokav &#8211; it forms a barrier between him and the Ribbono Shel Olam.” Comes the Torah to teach us, with all of the bounty I have provided you – strive for Kedusha. The secret: elohei maseicha lo sa’aseh lach, do not create barriers between yourself and Hakadosh Baruch Hu. Why? The posuk continues, “Ani Hashem Elokeichem” &#8211;  for I am Hashem your G-d. When our relationship is barrier free we can appreciate the reality of Hashem Yisborach’s kindness and hashgocha, 24/7. Barrier free, we can appreciate the gift of Torah u’mitzvos and our opportunity and responsibility of being an ohr la’amim. With out any obstacles in the way, the road to perfection is smooth traveling. It seems so easy.</p>
<p>But as the Rambam explains, when one succumbs to temptation, he can get stuck in the quagmire of cheit. In so doing, layer of upon layer of thicker and thicker material form a blockade between the Shechina and the nishama so desperate to see its Father. We can degrade into the ultimate hester panim, as a thick iron curtain of sin obstructs our view of Kudsha Brich Hu until He seems almost non-existent, chas v’shalom. This was the most pernicious impact of the golden calf, the eigel maseicha which Klal Yisrael fashioned in the desert.</p>
<p>Sadly, that barrier to giluy shechina and the clarity of the luchos rishonos is still with us today. We are challenged to tear down the vestiges of the eigel hazahav’s obstruction to emunah found in each generation and eliminate as well the impediments to emunah rooted in our own personal iniquities.</p>
<p>How can we succeed?  Sefiras Ha’omer provides the answer. We count toward matan Torah. One day at a time, we dismantle the barricades. Through Talmud Torah, asiyas HaMitzvos and refinement of our middos, we invite, as the Ohr Hachayim points out, the Shechina back into our lives and in so doing we eliminate the barriers found along the way. Indeed, with the avodah of each day’s count, we can, b’ezras Hashem, eliminate the hindrances to revelation and spiritual clarity. Inching ever closer to feel His presence, and achieving a life lived as kedoshim &#8211; ki kadosh ani Hashem Elokeichem!</p>

<h2>Parshas Metzorah<br />
The Mishkan Within</h2>
<p>As parshas Metzorah draws to a close we are reminded and warned of the importance of retaining our state of tahara as a people.</p>
<p>Following the myriad halchos of tumah and taharah which fill the parsha, we are told v’hizhartem es Bnei Yisrael mitumasom v’lo yamusu bitumasom bitamam es mishkani asher b’socham. This is a quite a critical posuk as various Tannaim and Amoraim throughout Shas darshan this verse for important halachos l’maasah. The many important halachic drashos derived from this posuk are accompanied by powerful aggadic drashos, as well. One such message is both inspiring and profound.<span id="more-4097"></span></p>
<p>The Sifrei expounds upon the words which conclude the posuk, bitamam es mishkani asher b’socham, and says; R’ Nosson omer: chavivim Yisrael sheb’chol makom shegalu Shechina imahem. Klal Yisrael is indeed special as the Shechina accompanies us when and wherever we go. Hashem’s love for us knows no bounds. This message is vital for our confidence and survival throughout the golus. Our continued existence depends on His love even when we do not fully deserve it. Boruch Hashem, He is with us throughout the trials and tribulations of the long and bitter exile.</p>
<p>But just where is He found?</p>
<p>As we scurry about the Diaspora, dispersed to the four corners of the earth, is there a place to find hope, sanctuary and salvation? Can we truly point to a particular repository of Shechina?</p>
<p>An insight form the Netziv says we can.</p>
<p>The Netziv teaches that at one level we should learn the words of the posuk literally. The phrase bitamam es mishkani asher b’socham, means to say &#8211; “haynu adam atzmo shehu mishkan laShechina!” Each Jew is a resting place for the Shechina in as much as we are a tzelem Elokim. Therefore the Shechina literally rests in us, not just in Eretz Yisrael, but wherever we are. Even b’tamam, when we mess up, Hakadosh Baruch Hu sticks with us. He clings to our neshama keeping the pintele Yid lit in every one of His children.</p>
<p>It is this profound element which makes us so special and dear. But it also carries with it responsibility. We need to be able to draw inspiration from introspection. We must be willing to open our eyes to feel His hashgacha pratis governing our lives and reach for the connection our inner soul naturally seeks with our Creator. If we but reflect upon all His goodness and our spiritual endurance, despite millennia of exile, we can tap into the power of the mishkan within and feel ourselves home to all of His glory. Even more, perhaps the Netziv is telling us that the building of the mikdash begins inside us all. With Pesach just around the corner there is no better time than the present to start.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Tazria<br />
Be a Man!</h2>
<p>Plague and penance are twin themes which emanate from the laws of tzaraas that fill our parsha. The personal impact of schar v’onesh is directed to one and all by the forceful words of the parsha. There are, however, other important issues raised by Chazal which teach us valuable lessons for eternity.</p>
<p>In describing the onset of the dreadful malady of tzaraas, the posuk states adam ki yhyeh b’or bsaro seis oh sapachas oh bahares vihasya b’or bsaro l’negah tzaraas. Chazal wonder, why is the term adam used as the appellation to describe an individual so horribly afflicted? Indeed, the Zohar states that adam (atem kruyim adam) is the highest madreiga of the four expressions used by the Torah to describe people (adam, gever, enosh and ish). Would not a person who has succumbed to the lowly level of cheit and/or defilement of character, which resulted in his becoming a metzorah, be more worthy of a title less significant than that of the lofty adam? How are we to reconcile the horrific reality of sin and the nobility of adam which the posuk has now bound together for eternity?<span id="more-4040"></span></p>
<p>One approach takes us more profoundly into the depths of this verse and leaves us with a phenomenal practical message. The Medrash Rabba and Tanchuma teach that the four stages of negaim described in the opening posuk of parshas negaim, s’eis, sapachas, bahares and l’negah tzaraas correspond to the four galuyos. S’eis is Bavel, sapachas equals the exile of Paras and Madai, bahares represents the domination of Yavon and negah tzaraas parallels the current long, dark, golus of Edom. What is their connection to tzaraas? And what are Chazal trying to teach us with this drasha?</p>
<p>Perhaps the pshat is an important lesson about ourselves and the attitude we must take in the quest for self improvement. In a perfect world we are the regal, noble and holy adam that Hashem Yisborach intended. Zos Toras haadam aptly describes the apex of our reach! We have a Torah all our own and a spiritual power and potential unmatched in maaseh breishis. We are the pinnacle of creation. We are His children.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when the cold winds of golus cast their chill upon us we do not merely suffer the physical depravation of exile, we find our ruchniyos wanting. Engulfed in the grip of the nations who surround us with their culture and values, we find that we slip and sadly, do not always hold our own over the forces of tumah which attempt to subvert us. We err in our spiritual judgments, our daily priorities and even how we treat each other. The result is Tzaaras. Not a very adam like behavior. Yet despite our fall, Hashem Yisborach wants to inspire us to do teshuva, to reach beyond the moment and strive higher. As such, He teaches us, My children, the s’eis, sapachas, bahares and negah tzaraas, are not the real you. You are an adam! You can transcend the golus and persevere, indeed you must. You can arm yourself to overcome the lonely, scorned life of the metzorah if you but focus your energy on being the adam that defines your opportunity for Kedusha in this world. As an adam you have so much potential. Do not despair of your plight. If you firmly set your sights on returning to your status and stature of adam you can shake off the blight of golus which has infected you. You can ward off the challenges to your emunah and avodas Hashem which befall you.</p>
<p>It is no different today, not when we err or when our children or our students make mistakes. The parsha reminds us that Hashem Yisborach sets forth a paradigm for the corrective process sometimes needed in chinuch (our own and others). He cries out to each of us, “My children, do not despair. Arise. Do not let the forces that surround you corrupt your beautiful neshama. Be the adam I know you can be.” Indeed, when positive energy is applied to the tikun of our flaws, there is no obstacle we cannot overcome.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Shemini<br />
Tovim Hashnayim Min Ha’Echad</h2>
<p>The Parsha commences with the celebration of Aharon and his sons as they ascend into the role of Kohanim for the very first time. Prepared, trained and ready to serve, they offer their first sacrifices filled with excitement and pride. While still atop the Mizbeach, The Posuk says vayisa Aharon es yadav — “Aharon Hakohein lifted up his hands to bless Klal Yisrael”. Filled with excitement and joy he turns toward Bnai Yisrael and blesses them with the words of Birchas Kohanim for the very first time. The climax of this monumental moment was to be when a heavenly fire would ignite the Mizbeach to offer an awesome revelation of the Shechina to all. But as Aharon completed the Bracha, all was  silent. Nothing happens.</p>
<p>Rashi explains how Aharon, stunned with disappointment, turned to his brother Moshe and lamented his “unworthiness” to serve. <span id="more-3967"></span>Moshe reassured him and together they approached the Ohel Moed. Inside they offered private prayers. Then, together, the Posuk says, vayeitzu vayivarchu es ha’am — “they went forth and blessed Klal Yisrael”. Immediately the Torah proclaims vayeireh kvod Hashem el kol ha’am— The Shechina was revealed for all to see. What changed to enable the success of this revelation?</p>
<p>&#8216;The Midrash itself provides us a clue. Says the Midrash, this episode is an example of tovim hashnayim min ha’echad — “two are better than one.” It is a reflection of  Heinei mah tov umah naim sheves achim gam yachad. Why?</p>
<p>A fundamental maxim of dedicating the Mishkan, is the knowledge that all Jews are interdependent. A Jew is never alone. Moreover, we can never look at ourselves as being complete. We have to continue to learn and to grow from one another other. When Jews function B’achva there is nothing that cannot be accomplished. This is the underlying message of the Chanukas Hamishkan. Aharon Hakohein was the conduit to provide this vivid reminder for us all. Indeed, we must always remember to not “go it alone”. We can take this lesson with us today as we consecrate the Mikdash Me’at of our home, shul or school. With the new month of geula, Nissan, upon the horizon, our sense of Achva must guide us. The number “one” is reserved for Hashem Yisborach alone. Only with the power of 2 can we fully connect to the Shney Luchos Habrius – and IY”H excel bein adam laMakom ubein adam lachaveiro to build the Beis Hamikdash anew, bimhara biyameinu Amen.</p>

<h2>Purim<br />
A Time To Know</h2>
<p>The notorious antagonist of the Purim saga is none other than the Amalekite, Haman. Chazal wonder, where can we find a hint to the existence of Haman and his nefarious plan to annihilate the Jewish people? They teach us that the phrase in Parshas Bereishis which describes Hashem Yisborach confronting Adam Harishon regarding the sin of eating from the Etz Hada’as, “Hamin haetz asher tzivisicha l’vilti achol mimenu achalta” is a remez to Haman. The word hamin and Haman have identical Hebrew letters. This needs further clarification. What does eating of the Etz Hada’as have to do with the Purim story at all? Moreover, there is an additional Medrash which says that the tree on which Haman was hanged was also the Etz Hada’as. How could the same tree be both the remez to the plot of Haman and be as well, the symbol of his ultimate downfall? To understand this further, we must shed some light on the essence of Amalek and his impact on Klal Yisrael.<span id="more-3932"></span></p>
<p>The Baal Haturim points out that the word Amalek shares the same gematria as the word safek. He teaches us, that it is Amalek who plants the seeds of doubt regarding our emunah, our connection to Hashem, and our responsibilities to behave as an am segula. Haman fostered and capitalized on these doubts by advising King Achashveirosh to invite the Jews to his feast. These doubts which epitomize the power of Amalek to separate us from the Shechina are actually rooted in the very first sin.</p>
<p>Before eating from the Etz Hada’as, Adam and Chava had clarity. They knew Hashem Yisborach. In the utopian world of Gan Eden, they were able to focus totally on the spiritual. Indeed, they never even noticed their own need for clothes. Their physical world was insignificant and they enjoyed the spiritual nirvana that was Gan Eden. However, upon eating from the Etz Hada’as, doubts crossed that reality. They were ashamed. Suddenly, that clarity of spiritual perspective was now clouded with shades of insecurity and disbelief that corrupts are hearts and minds till this very day.</p>
<p>This power to instill doubt, even among the faithful, is the secret weapon used by Amelek in his attempt to destroy the Jewish people and their belief in Hashem. It was Haman’s tool as well. Like his antecedent, Amalek, Haman used its corrupting power rooted in the first sin in Garden of Eden in his attempt to annihilate us all.</p>
<p>What was the response then and what should it be today? While it is true that the eye opening knowledge introduced to the world through the eating of the Etz Hada’as brought about safek, we also know that the only process to eradicate doubt is to acquire knowledge. The megilla tells us,  “v’Mordechai yada es kol asher na’asa-” Mordechai knew what was happening and he used this power of knowledge to eradicate Klal Yisrael’s doubts of their nitzchiyus and their relationship with the Ribbono Shel Olam. True, seventy years of golus had just about passed, but netzach Yisroel lo Yishaker, the geula would come. Klal Yisrael could and would continue their sacred mission as yodei Hashem, making His presence known to all of civilization. The antidote to Amalek, the cure to absorbing the insecurities presented by the Etz Hada’as is to become a stronger yodea, a more knowledgeable Jew. As Klal Yisrael, strengthened their yedia of Hashem and His Torah through tefilla and kabbalas Hatorah as described in the Megilla, they fashioned the weapon that would lead to Haman’s demise.</p>
<p>It is no different today. Purim is a time to know. The more we know, the better we learn and the more we live with the maxim of haphach bah v’haphich bo d’kula ba, the better we can eradicate Amalek and the dispersions he casts up our emunah still today. Yes, Haman was hung on the Etz Hada’as, not the dangerous small bits of knowledge that breed doubt, but the surety of knowledge which yields competence and confidence, a confidence so strong, we can reach the level of ad d’lo yada and still know what’s right and wrong with all our heart and soul.</p>
<p>Chag Purim Sameach</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Parshas Vayikra<br />
Exceeding the Angels</h2>
<p>Vayikrah el Moshe, with Hashem Yisborach calling out to Moshe Rabbeinu, we commence the study of Toras Kohanim. With an expression of chibah, the sefer begins with the avodas hakarbonos, the laws of sacrifice, the embodiment of the mesiras nefesh each Yid should have for his or her own personal avodas Hashem.</p>
<p>Chazal derive many vital yesodos from the very opening of the parsha. They note the verb phrases that commence the parsha (vayikrah el Moshe and daber el Bnei Yisrael) and they point out the obvious; Moshe Rabbeinu was not only spoken to by the Ribbono Shel Olam, but he was expected to speak out and transmit a message to Klal Yisrael. As a result, the Yalkut Shimoni exclaims; “gedolim tzaddikim yoser mimalachei hashareis shehamalachim einom yicholim lishmoah kolo . . . v’hatzadikkim yicholim lishmoah el kolo!” This, explains the Yalkut, is the personification of the posuk, giborei koach oseh d’varo lishmoah b’kol dvaro.</p>
<p>This aggada is difficult to fully comprehend. Could it be that tzaddikim are truly greater than the malachim who live in the upper spiritual realms? Is it not the malachim whom we echo in our proclamation of Kedusha each day? And is it true that the malachim do not hear Hashem Yisborach? How then, are they to follow His commands or transmit to us secrets heard machrei hapargud? What is the lesson Chazal are offering?<span id="more-3897"></span></p>
<p>The answer lies in realizing that that the essence of hearing is not in what one takes in, but in what he puts forth as a result. Malachim can only listen to Hashem Yisborach. With trepidation and awe, they do exactly as He wills. People also hear a message, but it is up to them to react and perform accordingly. Too often, individuals “hear” the message but, sadly, refuse to answer the call. Sometimes it is laziness. Other times, it is inconvenience. Though we may know what spiritual demands and standards are expected, our “humanity” gets in the way. We refuse lishmoah &#8211; to hearken to His will. We carry on no differently than before as we stubbornly neglect the writing written so brightly on the wall.</p>
<p>Tzaddikim, however, not only hear the message, but they respond to its impact. They listen to the summons from on High and rally their heart and soul to make a difference for themselves and the klal. They make the message personal as they create goals and ambitions for self improvement, spiritual advancement and refinement of character in their learning and kiyum hamitzvos. They seek avenues to help others connect spiritually as they inspire gadlus and advance the reality of the Ribbono Shel Olam in all of their endeavors. They heed the call and spread the message. It is a job which only Klal Yisrael can do and the malachim can not. It should be the ultimate by-product of our mesiras nefesh for Torah and all He expects from us. Lishmoah, and as a result, lilmod, ulilameid, lishmor, v’laasos ulikayeim es kol divrei Torasecha b’ahava!</p>
<p>This notion of “getting it” is a fundamental aspect of the avodas hakorbanos. It is not enough to offer an animal on the mizbeiyach. Rather, an emotional sense of this sacrifice being bimokomi &#8211; in place of me, is required for the message of the korban to hit home. The ensuing kaparah is manifest in our changing our lives for the better and learning to make it right for the future. True, the malachim are privileged to enjoy clarity and proximity to kaviyachol, the Ribbonon Shel Olam, by just doing His will. But, they can do no more and no less. However, we must constantly remember, gedolim tzaddikim yoser mimalachei hashareis. We can surpass the angels. Through our power of choice in clearly hearing (and reacting to) His words, doing His will, and making the difference He desires of us, we can, and indeed, exceed them all.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Pikudei<br />
The Mikdash Shel Maalah</h2>
<p>As we conclude sefer Shmos we are provided with a full accounting of the donations to the Mishkan. Moshe Rabbeinu answers the call of his critics who wondered whether or not he was truly an honest leader. A full accounting is provided. (It is a model of economic transparency which Klal Yisrael should still strive for today.)<span id="more-3876"></span></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Moshe Rabbeinu’s din v’cheshbon vis a vis the funds contributed to the Mishkan provide the backdrop of the actual hakomas hamishkan for the very first time. We are being taught that in order for the Mishkan to be a repository for the Shechina the very construction itself must meet the test of financial integrity. What a lesson in and of itself. Chazal, however, draw another fantastic yesod from this context.</p>
<p>The Posuk (40:18) declares vayakem Moshe es hamishkan, Moshe Rabaeinu erected the Mishkan. The Baal Haturim wonders, why is the word HaMishkan presented with the hey hayideah?  He quotes the psikata which teaches that the letter hey of Hamishkan is coming to include the Mikdash shel Maalah. We are being taught that at that same moment that Moshe Rabbeinu erected the Mishkan in this world, Hashem Yisborach commanded the malachim to build the Mishkan Shel Maalah.</p>
<p>Our efforts in this world are rewarded middah kineged middah in the olam ha’emes. What we build down below is established in a mirror universe on high. Indeed the Mishkan Shel Maalah is a reflection of our efforts on this world. KlalYisrael’s collective efforts, devotion and commitment are rewarded not just for us to enjoy in olam hazaeh, rather they create a reality in the Olam haElyon as well. This is not only true of the construction of the Mishkan but it is the mitzius for each and every mitzvah we perform.</p>
<p>There is more. The Psikta a few verses earlier (39:33) expounds on the words vayavi’ooh es hamishkan, they delivered the Mishakan. It states that the hey hayideah in that verse has an additional ribui, according to the Psikta it is to included brias shamayim vaaretz! The powerful message is clear. What we do on this world creates the reality we enjoy on heaven and earth. Do well and mitzvah goreres mitzvah &#8211; we are rewarded with opportunities for more mitzvos with which to earn the schar of Olam Habah as we spread ruchniyus in this world. Of course, r”l, the opposite is also true. Vayaveuh es Hamishkan our personal olam habah is the reflection of the spiritual accomplishments we deliver to the Kisay haKavod following our sojourn in this ephemeral world. We define our world then as well as now.</p>
<p>As we conclude sefer Shmos there is no more important lesson. The creation of these two worlds is in our hands. The backdrop of accountability is now clear. The kiyum of our world and the structure of the olmei olamim is our opportunity and responsibility. What we do matters. It is up to us to build well in this world so that the Ribbono Shel Olam will build for us our personal and communal mikdash of splendor in the world to come. Where we arrive, b’chol maasehem – in all of our journeys, in this world and the next, is ultimately the product of the mitzvos and maasim tovim we do each day.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayakhel<br />
Tein L’chacham Viyechkam Od</h2>
<p>As we learn of the construction phase of the Mishkan, the Torah describes  the artisans and craftsmen who fashioned the Mishkan as “kol ish chacham lev asher nasan Hashem chachma usivunah baheima—the wise hearted individuals in whom Hashem planted wisdom and understanding.” Chazal associate this posuk with a verse from Mishlei (9:9) tein l’chacham viyechkam od to derive an interesting lesson. The Torah, we know, is teaching us that it was the wise men to whom Hashem gave wisdom and understanding.</p>
<p>Chazal  wonder, The wise are already smart. Why didn’t Hashem give this bonus of extra wisdom to the feeble minded and the untalented? Shouldn’t Hashem give the gift of chachmah and tvunah to those who really need it?<span id="more-3847"></span></p>
<p>They answer with a moshal (adapted to contemporary times). With whom do people invest their assets? With the successful or the unsuccessful businessman? Surely the poor, “wannabe” entrepreneur struggling to make ends meet needs the infusion of capital far more than the very successful Wall Street investment banker. Yet nonetheless, we give our trust, confidence and checkbook to those who we feel have a track record of a solid return on our investment. We want to give our money to those who know how to grow our hard earned dollar. Says the Midrash, the same is true with Divine wisdom. Hashem grants it to those He knows will use it well. Hashem’s chachma and tvunah are only imparted to those in whom He has confidence will generate a healthy return on His investment. Thus only the chachmei lev—those who already demonstrated their intelligent application of wisdom were endowed with more to fashion the Mishkan. The wise were gifted with even more wisdom. These were the individuals who were nosei libom likarvah el hamilacha lasaos osah. They were motivated and had proven themselves to be committed to fulfilling the ratzon Hashem.</p>
<p>This idea of blessing those who have what they need with more of what they already have is not new. This lesson was first taught to us by Yaakov Avinu when he blessed his grandchildren. We are taught that Menashe was the businessman who managed Yosef Hatzadik’s affairs as viceroy to Pharoah. Ephraim, on the other hand was a great talmid chacham who modeled the lesson of his grandfather as an ish tam yosheiv ohalaim. Orech yamim biyiminam ubsimolam osher v’chavod, the right side is the represents the spiritual domain the left the more material. Yosef placed his sons in front of their grandfather so that Menashe would be opposite Yaakov’s right hand. Ephraim stood in front of Yaakov’s left hand. Yosef determined that Ephraim, the talmid chacham, needed help, with his gashmi affairs afterall he was always learnig what did he know of this world. Menashe the businessman needed an extra infusion of ruchniyos to provide him chizuk. Instead however, Yaakov seekeil es yadav, he made his hands “smart.” Indeed he crossed his hands so that his right was on Ephraim and the his left was on Menashe. Yaakov Avinu understood and taught us that we have to maximize the potential we have been given and not try to be something we are not. Ephraim the talmid chacham should shteig even higher. Menashe should have even more success in his business endeavors. As long as one is fulfilling his tafkid he is in good shape. This is a lesson we must constantly remember as we guide and nurture and our own children. They will excel in the areas they are destined to enjoy. We should note those strengths and build on them as Shlomo Hamelechg said &#8211; tein l’chacham viyechkam od.</p>
<p>This is an important reminder for us all.  Hashem has endowed each individual with a unique combination of talents and abilities. They have been invested with us la’sos es kol mileches avodas hakodesh lchal asher tziva Hashem, to perform His will with the special combination of talent and personality that defines our individual uniqueness. His confidence in our ability to earn Him a substantial return on that investment is what defines our challenge for life. If we simply follow the lead of Betzalel, Ahaleiav and their associates we, too, can be crowned as chachmei lev and bring the return His trust in us is intended to yield from all that we do, iy”H.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></em></p>
<h2>Parshas B’shalach<br />
“Heavenly Bread”</h2>
<p>After Krias Yam Suf, Hashem Yisborach responds to Klal Yisrael’s complaints for food by delivering them the mon. As a part of the process, He communicates to Moshe Rabbeinu what is to be an eternal lesson. The miracle of the mon was a six day per week experience. Rather than provide a bushel full of food to last for weeks, Hashem instructs v’laktu d’var yom b’yomo — Bnai Yisrael should gather (food) each day. This requirement is necessary, the posuk explains, l’maan annasenu hayeilech b’Torasi im lo — to test Klal Yisrael if they will follow the Torah or not.” Why, we may ask, the need of a test? Secondly, how is it connected to the mon? Finally it seems that this test is measuring emunah, why is it described in terms of hayeilech b’torasi  — following the Torah?<span id="more-3643"></span></p>
<p>The Mifarshim derive a powerful message from here. The most powerful measure of our commitment to Torah is found in our pursuit of parnassah — earning a livelihood. Too often, when it comes to the workplace, people make compromises in the standards Hashem demands from us in the Torah. It is as if they feel r”l that Hashem is unaware. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are reminded v’laktu d’var yom b’yomo lma’aan annasenu We must measure up to earn our keep every day. Even before Matan Torah, netzach Yisrael was being built on this maxim. The mon was distributed by Hashem and collected by the individual daily. Its flavor was determined by the values and taste of the recipient. And the amount of mon  which was delivered and the effort needed to collect it was a reflection of the quality of hayeilech b’Torasi as measured by the mitzvos and maasim tovim performed by the individual the previous day. This reinforced a constant dependence on Hashem. It can help keep us motivated to be ever vigilant in “following the Torah” through our Mitzvah observance, and personification of middos tovos in the work place.</p>
<p>At the revelation at Sinai described in next week’s parsha, Hashem gifted us with the tools needed to reach the loftiest realms of kedusha. Mon, the Heavenly bread, teaches us that through the seemingly mundane earthly process of earning a living we must feel His presence. In so doing we can IY”H merit His presents; brachos of parnassah, life, health and Nachas from our children, ad meah v’esrim shana.</p>

<h2>Parshas Bo<br />
This is it!</h2>
<p>Hachodesh hazeh lachem rosh chadashim. As the birth of Klal Yisrael unfolds, Hashem Yisborach presents us with our first national mitzvah, Kiddush Hachodesh. The Midrashim tell us that the calculations for proclaiming the new month were so complicated that Moshe Rabbeinu found them difficult. Finally, after struggling to comprehend all the astronomical details, Moshe Rabbeinu is provided clarity. Indeed, Chazal teach us that we learn from the word “hazeh” that Hakadosh Baruch Hu Kivayachol pointed to the moon and said to Moshe Rabbeinu “this is the new moon and its position in the sky.”</p>
<p>It is curious that Moshe “struggled” with the technical details of the lunar placement upon the horizon. Is it really more complicated than other complicated halachos?<span id="more-3615"></span> Moreover, it was not Moshe’s only “struggle.” Chazal point to four specific Mitzvos that presented a similar challenge and each is clarified with the expression of zeh—“this” is how it should be. In addition to the mitzvah of Kiddush Hachodesh, the topics are; the the intricate design of the Menorah, the description of the Machatzis Hashekel and the defining traits of a kosher animal. What is the common denominator that links these items? Furthermore, could it really be that these four concepts were so difficult for Moshe Rabbeinu, the one who spoke face to face with Hashem Yisborach? What is the message being taught?</p>
<p>In reality, Moshe was not personally challenged by these four concepts. But as the Rabban Shel Yisrael he was troubled for us and for our future. We know that these four topics represent the greatest challenge to us all, they represent: time, wisdom, gashmiyus and money. We wonder how to use and not abuse them. And we struggle. How to use the gift of time to maximize its potential and our pride in so doing? What to do with the wisdom that one has acquired and where to focus individual strengths and interests toward future growth? In relating to the olam hagashmi we seek to discern how to differentiate between satisfaction and indulgence? Finally, in regard to money, how to establish priorities that will yield the greatest, truest returns?</p>
<p>For each nisayon we are guided with a focused response of “Hazeh,” Hashem delineating the appropriate perspective for us to live by. By Hashem symbolically “pointing” to the new moon (time), the Menora (wisdom), kosher animal’s traits (physical world) and the half shekel (money), He points us away from the spiritual obstacles inherent in each and towards the spiritual pursuits for which we should strive. Then and as now, time is to be sanctified, each hour and minute to be used purposefully in avodas Hashem. Knowledge is to be shared, helping ignite and foster yedias Hashem in others. The physical world is to be harnessed with self-discipline to bring Kedusha to otherwise physical pursuits. And money offers us the opportunity to invest in His work.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge of existence is to successfully blend the pure Neshama we’ve been given with the material traits of humanity. Buffeted by four winds of turmoil our avodah is constantly put to the test. Moshe Rabbeinu is concerned and seeks guidance for his people l’dorei doros. Hashem Yisborah responds “zeh – this” is just what we need.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></em></p>
<h2>Parshas Vaera<br />
L’ma&#8217;an Sapper Shmi</h2>
<p>The devastation of Mitzrayim during the 10 plagues left the Egyptian landscape changed forever. Clearly the purpose of the makkos was not merely the exodus of Klal Yisrael from the tyrannical rule of Pharoah. After all, Hashem could have just escorted all the Jews out of Egypt in one fell swoop. What then was the objective of the 10 -step staged destruction of Egypt,  its culture and people?</p>
<p>The Kli Yakar explains that the makkos were to provide a tikkun for the lack of emuna which was pervasive in the Mitzri culture. <span id="more-3576"></span>Pharoah denied Hashem’s existence and omnipotence. Pharoah tells Moshe, “I know not of Hashem, nor will I listen to Him.” Yet, as each plague descends upon Egypt, Pharaoh and the Mitzriyim are systematically and progressively shown that Hashem Hu HaElokim, bashamayim u’varetz! They have no choice but to recognize His hashgacha over all. As the Yad Hashem becomes ever clear with each and every plague the ultimate goal of the ten makkos is realized until it climaxes with the declaration l’maan saper Shmi.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Pharaoh and his people are taught that it is not merely enough to acknowledge the Ribbono Shel Olam’s presence in this world. We must do our best ”l&#8217;ma’an sapper Shmi”- in order to proclaim His reality to all. Eventually the Egyptians got the point. Klal Yisrael is ejected from the throes of their servitude. Geula is at hand.</p>
<p>However, this lesson was not meant for the Mitzrim alone. It is really intended for us. With the revelation of Sinai close at hand, Hakadosh Baruch Hu was paving the way for the true purpose of geula; to become an “ohr la’amim,” a light to all nations. The soon to be experienced Matan Torah, would gift us with the tools for Kiddush Shem Shamayim, enabling us to be His ambassadors for kedusha in this world. Our awareness of l&#8217;ma’an sapper Shimi and our commitment to implementing that attitude in each aspect of our lives, 24/7, is the final step in the preparatory process for redemption. It is an  opportunity and responsibility for every ben and bas Yisrael which can bring the geula closer each day.</p>
