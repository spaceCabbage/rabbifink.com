				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>At the amazing Pacific Jewish Center Chanukah party yesterday, I spoke about using stories to keep our Judaism vibrant. After all, the Torah and Talmud are books of law but are replete with stories. Chanukah in particular is only told through stories as it is not mentioned in Tanach and the scant references in the Mishnah don&#8217;t inform us of the day&#8217;s obligations. Our knowledge of the day comes only thought stories. Even Maimonides, in his Mishneh Torah, which is devoid of storytelling for the most part, tells the story of Chanukah. So I urged everyone to tell Chanukah stories in their homes and add some warmth to the Mitzvahs of the day.<span id="more-7920"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/timthumb.php_.jpeg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7921" alt="timthumb.php" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/timthumb.php_-600x399.jpeg" width="480" height="319" /></a>After the talk, Vladimir Skomarovsky told me his (true) Chanukah story.</p>
<p>From December 1941 to liberation in 1944, Vladimir and his mother were in hiding. They lived the catacombs of Odessa with other Jewish people who escaped the Holocaust by fleeing to the caves with their lives.</p>
<p>The catacombs of Odessa are an extensive network of underground caves.They are about 200 years old and the catacombs were home to many refugees escaping the Nazis.</p>
<p>On Chanukah they had no oil or candles, or could simply ill afford to consume valuable fuel to kindle the Chanukah lights. When it came time to light Chanukah candles, everyone in the cave would pick up rocks. In concert, they would scratch the shape of a candle into the cave wall. The first night they would carve candle number one, on the second night they would carve candle number two, and so it would be for eight days.</p>
<p>They could not light Chanukah candles with fire but the fire in their souls inspired them to keep the flame of Chanukah alive with their Chanukah menorah carvings deep in the catacombs of Odessa.</p>
<p>Vladimir celebrates Chanukah with candles of wax and oil today. But the spirit of his experience in the catacombs of Odessa lives on in his soul.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>At the very least, Yom Kippur gives us a reason to put our lives on pause and evaluate how we are doing. Inevitably we&#8217;ve hurt some people along the way. Yom Kippur reminds us to make amends with those people who have been harmed by our insensitivity or malice. It&#8217;s obviously better to apologize and make peace than it is to allow the pain to fester and infect us long term.<span id="more-7626"></span></p>
<p>I am not a fan of digital requests for for forgiveness. They are impersonal and make it seem like one is trying to take a shortcut rather than the heartfelt apology that is deserved.<img class="alignright  wp-image-7627" alt="forgiveness-healing-heart" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/forgiveness-healing-heart-600x552.jpeg" width="420" height="386" /></p>
<p>However I do think that I need to make a digital request for forgiveness as well offer as an e-apology. Many people who read this blog or my thoughts on other digital platforms only know me through this medium. I don&#8217;t even know who many of you are. In fact the people who are probably most offended or hurt by things I have said are people that don&#8217;t even comment or &#8220;Like&#8221; posts on Facebook. They read, they get upset, and they are silent. Sometimes I get irate emails. I get it. I do appreciate the chance to have a dialogue. It is far better than when people just stay angry without seeking an explanation.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that I know for certain that I have hurt people by the things I have written. For that I sincerely apologize. I don&#8217;t intend to hurt anyone and I regret that anyone was insulted or incensed by what I have written.</p>
<p>I am sorry for anything and everything that made you upset or made you feel bad about something. I know it happens and I am truly sorry.</p>
<p>I beg your forgiveness. Let&#8217;s go into Yom Kippur with a clean slate. All of us deserve the opportunity to pass through judgment by the Almighty free of the shackles interpersonal disputes place on us. We enter Yom Kippur with unity and one love.</p>
<p>As for all of you readers who may think you need to ask me forgiveness, you don&#8217;t. No one does. I don&#8217;t bear any grudges. I don&#8217;t take offense to anything you&#8217;ve written or said about me. I probably deserved it anyway. And even if I didn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s cool. Don&#8217;t worry.</p>
<p>I wish everyone a beautiful Yom Kippur. My favorite day of the year at Pacific Jewish Center is Yom Kippur. If you&#8217;d like to find out why, I invite you to join us either this year or sometime in the future. Wherever you are, I hope the day lives up to its lofty potential for you.</p>
<p><em>May we all be inscribed in the Book of Life.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Another Yom Kippur is upon us. I remember talking with my 10th grade rebbe R&#8217; Kalman Weinreb outside the High School Beis Medrash on Erev Yom Kippur 5757. I was complaining about how hard the fast was for me. I suggested that it would be easier to pray and repent if I could just eat and drink a little. Not a lot, just a little. He empathized with my 15 year old sensibilities but explained to me how the complete immersion in spiritual pursuits requires complete immersion not almost complete immersion. He said it would be worth it. All good things are worth the difficult path we must take to arrive at our desired destination. R&#8217; Kalman was about to wrap up our conversation and then he looked at me with a gleam in his eye and told me that the fast gets easier every year. That was it. He walked away.<span id="more-7622"></span></p>
<p>My 15 year old self thought it was great news that the fast was going to get easier every year. Something to look forward to.<img class="alignright  wp-image-7623" alt="Kol_nidre_in_the_machzor_of_Worms" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Kol_nidre_in_the_machzor_of_Worms-508x600.jpg" width="305" height="360" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s true. The fast does get easier every year. This is my sixth Yom Kippur in an official capacity at Pacific Jewish Center. The first year I led the services for Kol Nidre, Maariv, and Neilah. I also spoke 4 times. I thought that I could not possibly do any more. Four years ago I started doing Mussaf as well. Indeed, it does get easier every year.</p>
<p>My 32 year old self does not agree with my 15 year old self. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good that the fast gets easier every year. The easier the fast becomes, the harder it is to truly experience the dread and discomfort that help make the day so powerful. I am not suggesting that we make it extra hard on ourselves. We take the day as it comes. But I think something is lost as we grow older. Our idealism may fade a bit. Our imagination is a little less active. Our dreams are not quite as vivid. We don&#8217;t feel things the way we did when we were younger. That&#8217;s why it gets easier.</p>
<p>While that may make surviving Yom Kippur less of a challenge, it can make living the day more challenging. It&#8217;s a new challenge every year. The hardest part of the challenge is being aware that it is there. I&#8217;ve only recently realized that this is something I need to work on for my own Yom Kippur experience.</p>
<p>The challenge is different. But we are certainly up to the challenge. Instead of struggling to pray while we feel ragged and tired we must struggle to feel ragged and tired as we breeze through the prayers.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The goal of Yom Kippur is not to get through the day. Rather the goal is for the day of Yom Kippur to go through us.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Its unique blend of spirituality should be coursing through our veins by the end of the day. After all, it&#8217;s the only thing we&#8217;ve put into ourselves for 25 hours.</p>
<p>If we succeed, and I am confident we will, we will realize the full magnitude of the gains to had on Yom Kippur no matter where we are in life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6714" alt="image_preview" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image_preview-300x261.jpeg" width="300" height="261" />Last week, the Fall 2012 issue of Klal Perspectives was released. I noted the excellent article written by Rabbi Ilan Feldman and recommended that everyone read it. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/20/one-excellent-article-from-the-new-klal-perspectives-kiruv-issue/">One Excellent Article From Klal Perspectives Fall 2012 on Kiruv</a>)</p>
<p>I mentioned at the time that I would attempt to address the issues raised in the journal.</p>
<p>Klal Perspective writers were asked to address three general questions. Some additional background is provided on the Klal Perspectives site. See here: <a href="http://klalperspectives.org/fall-2012/fall-2012-questions/">Klal Perspectives</a>. These are the three questions:</p>
<p>1. What are the most significant dimensions of current outreach efforts, and how effective are they?</p>
<p>2. In light of the various alternative objectives that may be pursued in conducting outreach, by what criteria is success measured? Are the prevailing measurements of success the appropriate measurements? Can results be reliably calculated? And how is the donor or volunteer able to ascertain which target demographic and which approach to kiruv enjoys the greatest realization and success?</p>
<p>3. Has kiruv in America runs its course due to the combination of (a) decades of assimilation that has diminished the number of accessible, non-observant Jews who are halachically Jewish, and (b) the rapidly diminishing sense of Jewish identity among younger, secular Jews? Or, do these factors mitigate in favor a more powerful outreach push, since in a decade or two it may be too late? And finally, what are the new frontiers in outreach that may yet be explored?</p>
<p>My response:<span id="more-6669"></span></p>
<p>Klal Perspectives did not define their terms when they asked for responses to their three questions. The questions are also very vague. As a result it is not easy to simply answer the three questions without making several assumptions. This article will not make any assumptions about definitions nor will it fill in the gaps of the vague questions.</p>
<p><b>I. Dimensions of Successful Kiruv</b></p>
<p>I don’t know what “the most significant dimensions of current outreach efforts” means so I can’t really answer that part of the question. I can’t answer how effective they are because I don’t know what is being discussed. I think the question might be asking in a roundabout way, what kind of kiruv is most effective. If that is what is being asked, the question is backwards.</p>
<p>In my experience, I have seen that kiruv is not a success or a failure depending on the group or sub-group that a particular kiruv professional is working with. Success is almost always dependent on the individual kiruv professional’s drive, talent, and commitment. In other words, focusing on the demographic is a huge error. A great kiruv professional will have success no matter the age, no matter the ethnicity, no matter the circumstances.</p>
<p>This is because kiruv is not about systems, or programs, or even content. Kiruv is about relationships and good sales.</p>
<p>The successful kiruv professional is an outstanding salesperson. An outstanding salesperson can sell to anyone. Put an excellent kiruv professional in any setting and the kiruv professional will be very successful. Therefore, trying to figure out which of our current kiruv efforts is most effective looks at the wrong side of the equation. It’s less about the pool of prospective kiruv candidates and much more about the person doing the kiruv.</p>
<p>It’s also about the product being sold. Some kiruv professionals sell the version of orthodox Judaism that is the simplest sell. It is often riddled with half-truths and late night television informercial promises. This might work for a short time, or even a long time, but ultimately it is a dangerous game. We don’t want to ensnare people into orthodox Judaism, we want people to be attracted to orthodox Judaism. The good salesperson with the hard sell might be very successful on the surface, but that kind of kiruv is just creating problems that will manifest later on. The best salesperson is honest, straightforward, and passionate. We have a great product. There is no need to puff it up like a used car salesperson. Again, success is less about the group being targeting and more about the sale.</p>
<p>Successful, long term kiruv requires relationships and a good, honest sell.</p>
<p><b>II. Measuring Success</b></p>
<p>This is the area of kiruv where I think I am the furthest from the mainstream. Millions of dollars are being poured into kiruv and there is an expectation of quantifiable results and success. This is generally measured as facilitating a move from non-<i>shmiras mitzvos</i> to <i>shmiras mitzvos</i>. At the very least it has been defined as “preventing an intermarriage.”</p>
<p>Most people who become <i>shomer mitzvos </i>do so as a result of many influences in their lives. The initial kiruv professional who introduced them to a nice frum family, the frum family that introduced them to the charismatic pulpit rabbi, the pulpit rabbi who sent them off the <i>yeshiva, </i>the rebbeim at the yeshiva who worked with them as beginners, the teachers of the more advanced tracks in the <i>yeshiva, </i>the family in <i>Eretz Yisrael </i>who took them into their home, the rabbi who counseled them after they started <i>shmiras mitzvos, </i>and the anonymous person who made a kiddush Hashem through their excellent character and was merely observed, are all people who can take “credit” for helping this person. Donors are likely seeing several parties “claim” each kiruv success story which makes definitive numbers even more elusive.</p>
<p>Further complicating matters, many organizations and communities have segmented their kiruv efforts as a result of applying business principles to kiruv. One group makes initial contact and inspires the potential kiruv candidate. Another group handles the potential kiruv candidate through the first stages of real kiruv. The next group pushes the potential kiruv candidate to study in yeshiva.</p>
<p>The problem is that when one is pushed through a system no one person in that system feels solely responsible for that person. Initially, this is not an issue as the system takes care of its people. But when the kiruv is done and the person returns from yeshiva, the people who placed the person along this exciting path of discovery and change are working on their next potential kiruv candidates. Compounding matters, the group that attracts new people to orthodox Judaism, and the group that cultivates that interest, and the group who push the potential kiruv candidate to yeshiva may be very, very good at what they do, but they may have no idea how to counsel and guide a baal teshuva. Too often, those who have become frum get terrible advice from the people who helped them find their Judaism in the first place. Then it is the community rabbis and others who are left to pick up the pieces. Sometimes the pieces can’t be put back together and we are left with a broken home, confused children, and resentment toward orthodox Judaism. Helping baalei teshuva is not necessarily the forte of kiruv workers, and even if it were something they could do, or wanted to do, they are busy finding the next group of potential kiruv candidates. Helping people who are already frum does not help their numbers anymore. The sale has been made. It’s time to move on.</p>
<p>It’s wrong to think that once someone is frum they won’t need a lot of guidance. Everything is new to them. What is second nature to those who are frum from birth has to be learned by those who are not. Family relationships must be managed and complicated questions of loyalty are often raised. Helping people who are already frum does not have the glamour of kiruv, but it is vital to the success of our kiruv efforts.</p>
<p>Using metrics to measure success and as a basis for funding has many advantages. It incentivizes efficiency, it gives kiruv professionals real goals, and it gives the donors reason to believe that their monies are being used wisely. There is a darker side to the metrics as well. Kiruv professionals run the risk of viewing kiruv candidates as numbers instead of looking at them as human beings. It also can harm efforts to help baalei teshuva once they return from yeshiva. But most importantly I think it has established a standard in kiruv that is simply wrong.</p>
<p>I disagree with the popular definition of kiruv. I don’t think that the goal of kiruv to facilitate one’s movement from non-<i>shmiras mitzvos</i> to <i>shmiras mitzvos</i>. I think that in order to foster a real relationship with another person, the foundation of the relationship must be truth. When I worked as a kiruv professional on college campuses students were often suspicious that the only reason I was being nice to them was because I wanted something from them. They reasoned to themselves that I was friendly because I hoped they would adopt my lifestyle. They assumed that the free things I was throwing at them had ulterior motives. Perhaps they thought I received a cash bonus for every Shabbos they kept. My employers, or maybe it was just their donors, wanted people to become frum and that’s why I was talking to them. They might have been right. But I did not want them to be right. So I worked very hard to make sure that I was genuinely concerned with their wellbeing. My exclusive interest and explicitly stated goal was to foster friendships. I was not selling anything. I was just making friends. I wanted these friends to become part of my life, my family, my community, and come to Israel with me when I took my college student friends on a trip to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>It was very important to me that I be able to look every single student in the eye and say “I just want to provide you with an opportunity for a relationship with an orthodox rabbi.” That’s all. That was my goal. It had to be my goal if I was going to be honest with everyone that I met. And I really wanted to be completely honest.</p>
<p>My employers and supporters wanted to see students becoming <i>shomrei Torah u’mitzvos </i>and so did I, most of the time. But that was not my goal. It was one of many possible outcomes that would result from a relationship. The relationship was my goal.</p>
<p>That experience has profoundly impacted the way I view kiruv. I think that the stated goal of kiruv should not be <i>shmiras mitzvos. </i>In my mind, the goal of kiruv is to “<b>provide positive Jewish experiences to the maximum number of people possible.</b>” This way I can be honest. This way I can be proud of providing those experiences. This way I can make my goals based on what I am doing and not the choices of others. I can provide the experience, I can make the experience positive. I cannot control what others will do as a result of those experiences. If one is inspired by the experience and wants to learn more, I am willing, ready, and able to help them along that path.</p>
<p>In my shul, we try to create positive Jewish experiences for the maximum number of people possible. This is our goal. I can say with certainty that we are very successful at achieving this goal. Every year, hundreds of people have positive Jewish experiences in my shul. Some of them are frum people, some of them are not yet frum, some of them will never be frum, but they all have positive Jewish experiences. (Parenthetically, I think this should be the goal of orthodox Jewish education for our own children and communities). Accomplishing this goal requires a community of people who are committed to this goal and an environment that accepts everyone without judgment. We do not allow non-orthodox Jews to step into a shul and feel like fresh kiruv candidate meat. They are not. We make sure that whoever steps into our shul feels the brotherhood of Judaism and that they too can find something special in their Judaism through our shul.</p>
<p>If the positive Jewish experience inspires someone to be a better person, albeit not a frum Jew, that is also a good thing. If the positive Jewish experience challenges a non-affiliated Jew to go to a Reform Temple or a Conservative Synagogue more often, that is also a success. If we make a kiddush Hashem because more people have favorable things to say about frum Jews and commitment to Torah, that is also a success.</p>
<p>We can’t tell potential kiruv candidates that they are only a “real” baal teshuva if they go to a certain type of yeshiva and end up wearing a black hat on Shabbos. I have heard too many examples of people involved with kiruv organizations hearing from their kiruv rabbis that modern orthodoxy is not an option. They hear that modern orthodoxy is just as bad, or as pointless as being Conservative or Reform. This is wrong on several levels. Modern orthodoxy need not be viewed as a compromise or lesser form of orthodox Judaism. It is not. Further, we can’t allow ourselves to perpetuate the myth that non-orthodox Jews are devoid of spirituality and commitment. This is simply untrue. There are orthodox Jews who are devoid of spirituality and commitment and there are non-orthodox Jews who are spiritually fulfilled and very committed to their brand of Judaism. Kiruv cannot be an all or nothing proposition. Kiruv is about creating relationships with people and it is about giving people positive Jewish experiences. Right wing orthodox Judaism is not for everyone and we must provide opportunities for people to grow Jewishly in many ways, not only by blossoming into one specific type of orthodox Jew.</p>
<p>Using a very narrow definition of kiruv and focusing on the numbers to determine success can potentially undermine these efforts. Most importantly, by changing our focus to a more holistic approach to kiruv, as a community we will be more conscious of the needs of those who are moving through the kiruv system as kiruv professionals will not be bogged down by pursuing numbers and kiruv won’t end after the sale has been made.</p>
<p><b>III. The Future</b></p>
<p>Kiruv has not run its course. It is just as important today as it was yesterday. It helps the frum community hone its message, but more importantly, it allows frum Jews and not frum Jews to interact. Interdenominational interaction is still taboo in the frum community. One of the few trapdoors we have into that world is our kiruv efforts. We need more of that, not less. Non-orthodox Jews are our family. There has been too much separation between us. We can no longer afford to cut off our nose to spite our face. Hopefully that will change for the better soon. But if the only way to maintain dialogue with our non-orthodox brothers and sisters is via kiruv, <i>dayenu</i>.</p>
<p>I think the future of kiruv is along the lines of the model I have suggested here. The future is providing orthodox Jewish experiences for the masses. These experiences will be without pretense and with no expectation of commitment. But the more people who are exposed to orthodox Judaism, the greater number of people who will find it attractive. There will always be people who want to live the beautiful life of committed, passionate orthodox Judaism. We want those who might find our lifestyle attractive to have the opportunity to discover as much as possible about orthodox Judaism. We want those who want to grow Jewishly through means other than orthodox Judaism to be inspired to do that. In the future, all passionate Jews will participate in this kind of kiruv; the denominational lines will be blurred as we are all partners in the future of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>I see the future of kiruv as a time where we are all working towards expanding our circles of Jewish relationships. It will be a time where positive Jewish experiences are the goal and we can measure success by the experience and not yeshiva enrollments.</p>
<p>There is reason to he hopeful that this model can become the standard. It will take restraint from the donors and careful hiring of the right kind of kiruv professionals. It can be done, it must be done, it will be done, and we will all be better for it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/6049782072_7f51700c2a_b.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6286" title="6049782072_7f51700c2a_b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/6049782072_7f51700c2a_b-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>I rarely post anything on my blog that could be construed as personal or related to my family life. I try very hard to separate the two. This post is a moderate exception.</em></p>
<p>On Friday I moved to Santa Monica CA. I have been the rabbi at The Shul on the Beach in Venice for four years and had been commuting with my family almost every Shabbos and Yom Tov to be at the shul. After four years we decided to make the move and relocate our family from Hancock Park to the beach community. I could not be happier with our decision.</p>
<p>I have been eager to write this post for several years but felt it was disingenuous unless I took my own advice. Now I have, and so here it is&#8230;</p>
<p>The community based around the Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach is mostly made up of residents of Marina del Rey, Venice, and Santa Monica. In my opinion, it is the ideal Jewish community. I believe we have a model worth emulating and a community worth joining. Read on and you&#8217;ll see why I feel this way.</p>
<p><span id="more-6283"></span></p>
<p>On Friday night we sing Shalom Aleichem together after services. Every week we lock arms and sway as we sing the familiar Shabbos tune. I looked around this week and I saw a vibrant but elderly Yemenite Israeli, a Los Angeles native middle-aged baal Teshuva, a traditional 40-something single guy from South Jersey, the academic son of a Conservative Rabbi in his 60s, a young man from Tarzana who usually goes to the Happy Minyan in Pico-Robertson, a young professional who only recently started coming to shul for the first time in his life to say kaddish for his late father, among others. One can&#8217;t help but feel a surge of emotion as the group with its incredibly diverse Jewish backgrounds joined together in welcoming the Shabbos.</p>
<p>On Shabbos morning we had several guests, as usual. One couple was from Lakewood, NJ. They were a typical yeshivish Lakewood couple. Another couple was from Livingston, NJ. They were a borderline modern Orthodox couple. The Lakewood couple said the davening was beautiful and they really enjoyed it. They were surprised how much they liked it and were going to tell their friends to include our shul in their vacation plans. The Livingston couple said that the services and the sermon were perfect for them and they are looking forward to being with us over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Where else in the world can you find such diversity at a minyan? Where else can you find visitors from opposite sides of the orthodox spectrum with the exact same reaction to a shul? Outside the Kotel, there cannot be too many places like that in the world.</p>
<p>This encapsulates our community.</p>
<p>As I am fond of saying, we have ashkenazim and sephardim, Americans, Israelis, South Americans, South Africans, North Africans, Russians, French, Italians, Brits, and Australians, and others who call our shul home. We have baalei teshuva, not-yet baalei teshuva, frum from birth, not frum from birth, or not frum ever, converts, not-yet converts, people who consider themselves orthodox, and people who adamantly do not. We have a little bit of everything. That&#8217;s just the way we like it.</p>
<p>There are places &#8220;out of town&#8221; that can make similar claims. But they are still missing the creature comforts of a large Jewish community like Los Angeles. We are in close proximity to a large variety of schools, several large kosher markets, kosher restaurants, every kind of Torah learning and class, and events for all kinds of Jewish experiences. This is a very unique combination that marries the benefits of out of town life with living in a thriving orthodox community.</p>
<p>Living in a fairly insular orthodox Jewish community can be an unbelievable experience. Many people thrive in that kind of environment. I do not question the wisdom of insular communities. However, I do know that they do not work for everyone. I know this because it doesn&#8217;t really work for me. But know it doesn&#8217;t work for other people because of the emails I get on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Some people feel intimidated in insular communities. Some people feel lost in insular communities. Some people want be in a diverse environment for whatever reason. Some people want a shul where they can meet people from different social circles. Some people want a shul where they can make a difference in the lives of complete strangers. Some people just don&#8217;t fit into the expected molds within the insular communities. Some people would like to have neighbors from different backgrounds and religious beliefs. Some people, whether justified or not, feel like they are constantly under scrutiny or are &#8220;being judged&#8221; in more insular communities.</p>
<p>Those kinds of people are likely to be frustrated by insular orthodox Jewish communities. They might be unhappy. They might feel left out. They might even resent the community and sometimes they resent Judaism by association.</p>
<p>This is very unfortunate.</p>
<p>I know it can seem daunting and maybe even a little crazy, but I have an offer for those people: Try the Pacific Jewish Center community. Our community is the kind of environment where anyone can thrive. Everyone has their own space and there is room for all kinds of people. The core of the community is strong and is welcoming to anyone.</p>
<p>You can be part of a community that makes a huge difference in the lives of many people. Uniquely situated on the Venice Boardwalk &#8211; literally on the beach, thousands of people pass our shul every week. A lot of them stop in and say hi. Some of those people stay for a little while and find a small sliver of inspiration in those moments. Some of them become part of the shul and our community. But even the people who do not have the time or the courage or the interest to poke their head into the shul, are affected by the shul. They see a shul in a very unlikely place and it gives them pause. It causes to think and consider their Judaism, or if they are not Jewish, their religion, or if they are not religious, their personal path. The shul functions on its most basic level as a landmark that says to people that they should stop and contemplate their lives. Some people want to be part of something special like that.</p>
<p>My life goal is to make Torah and Judaism as accessible to as many people as possible. I try to do that on the blog in many ways. One way is to give a voice to those who have legitimate complaints. Another way is to start a conversation about contemporary orthodox Judaism. That is why I do my Daf Yomi and put it online. I want people to be able to learn Torah in short bursts if they don&#8217;t have the time or interest in an hour long class. That is what I do at the shul as well. The programs and services are designed to present Torah and Judaism in an accessible way to the maximum number of people possible.</p>
<p>To underscore this point, there are people who come to our shul that might not go to shul anywhere else. We are proud of that.</p>
<p>I want people out there to know that if you are not in love with your community and shul, you can be. You just need to find the right place for you and your family. For more people than not, the Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach can be that place. If insular communities don&#8217;t work for you, see if you are able to join us for a Shabbos. Try us out. See if you feel the magic of The Shul on the Beach. Most people do.</p>
<p>(Are there reasons not to live here? Yes. There is no eruv, yet. Housing is expensive. It is a bit of a commute to the schools. Some people find the beach-like atmosphere a great spiritual challenge. There are reasons not to join our community. But those reasons do not outweigh the benefits for people who feel like they don&#8217;t fit in where they are currently living. And the beach lifestyle has much to offer. There is a conscious focus on health and wellbeing, people walk, they buy their produce from Farmer&#8217;s Markets, they ride their bikes, it is a more relaxed, less urban lifestyle.)</p>
<p>At the very least, think about it. If you&#8217;ve been feeling out of place in your own home, give us a shot. If you know someone who could use a place where they would feel more at home tell them to check us out.</p>
<p>I hope to see you all at The Shul on the Beach sometime soon&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft" title="Daf" src="http://daf.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wasserzeichen-projekte.php_.jpeg" alt="" width="331" height="110" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a very exciting six weeks. We launched a Daf Yomi class at Pacific Jewish Center in Venice with several devoted attendees. We also launched a <a href="http://daf.finkorswim.com" target="_blank">Daf Yomi site</a> online with <a href="http://youtube.com/rabbifink" target="_blank">YouTube videos</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/daf-yomi-online/id549612151" target="_blank">iTunes podcasts</a> reaching people across the world.</p>
<p>The class is unique because we go through the Daf fairly quickly and focus on the simple explanation of the text. Most classes are between 20 and 25 minutes. Some are under 20 minutes but none are more than 30 minutes. This is great for people who have limited time or limited attention spans. If you are a more visual learner you can watch the class and if you want to just listen you can listen on the website or on iTunes. The site and the class are all part of my personal mission to bring Torah to as many people as possible and make Torah and Judaism accessible to the maximum number of people. Now, people with no background in Talmud can learn Daf Yomi.</p>
<p>I have received emails and messages from people in several states and from abroad as well. Some of the emails are corrections for mistakes I made in the course of the class. I appreciate those. Nobody is perfect. I have also received notes of appreciation from many people watching or listening to the classes.</p>
<p>It has been very rewarding to hear from so many people enjoying the class. Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to continuing this class for as long as possible.</p>
<p><em>We have an announcement to make about sponsorships and dedications for the Daf Yomi Class.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>A Message from David Katz Esq., the PJC Daf Yomi Chairperson:</strong></p>
<p>Since the beginning of this Daf Yomi web site I have been approached by several people asking what they can do to support Rabbi Fink’s tremendous undertaking of this multi-year project. To that end I am pleased to announce that we are now accepting sponsorships and dedications to underwrite one or more Daf Yomi classes.</p>
<p>All sponsorships and dedications will be prominently displayed across many platforms. At the beginning of each class, Rabbi Fink will make an announcement thanking the sponsor and the name or names or those in whose name that evening’s class will be dedicated in accordance with the sponsor’s instructions. The iTunes podcast will indicate the dedication in the text description for the class, the YouTube video will indicate the dedication in the introduction to the class, the Daf Yomi website will announce the dedication in textual format similar to a “banner ad”. Finally, dedications will also be noted on Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>Through the use of the internet, each sponsorship or dedication can reach tens of thousands of viewers worldwide and will be seen every time someone views your sponsored class. In other words, the sponsorship doesn’t expire until, please G-d, this cycle is completed.</p>
<p>What a unique and fitting tribute for an individual or family to sponsor a class in memory of a loved one or their yartzeit, or to celebrate a simcha, birthday, or other important life cycle event. Even if you can’t find a particular reason to sponsor, it’s a great way to make a tax-deductible contribution to support this important site which disseminates Torah worldwide.</p>
<p>There are already hundreds of people tuning-in to this Daf Yomi class every day and you can help support their learning with your donation. It&#8217;s also a great way to express your appreciation for an internet based daily Daf Yomi class. <strong>The class will always be free, but your financial support would be greatly appreciated.</strong></p>
<p>We hope you are enjoying the Daf and are growing spiritually. Thank you very much for being a part of our worldwide Daf Yomi community.</p>
<p>Here is how it works:</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to become a partner in this venture you can</p>
<ol>
<li>Sponsor One Daf for <strong>$100</strong></li>
<li>Sponsor One Week for <strong>$500</strong></li>
<li>Sponsor One Month for <strong>$1800</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to sponsor a particular mesechta or perek we can arrange that as well.</p>
<p>All you need to do is to click the Donate button below and make your tax-deductible contribution using your credit card. If you&#8217;d like to send us a check send an Rabbi Fink an email for instructions at <a href="mailto:rabbifink@gmail.com" target="_blank">rabbifink@gmail.com</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RH-2012-Card.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6214" title="RH 2012 Card" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/RH-2012-Card-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>In what has become a bit of a custom for me, I took to the Venice Boardwalk on Sunday to wish everyone a sweet new year. As usual, I met some very interesting and wonderful people through the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Many people stopped by to dip the apple in the honey which is not as easy as it looks with the nice ocean breeze wreaking havoc with honey drips. Some stepped into the shul for a few moments and we had some lovely conversations. Everyone got free apples and honey and an open invitation to join us at the Shul on the Beach for High Holidays services.</p>
<p>Of all the people that stopped by, three were of particular interest.<span id="more-6213"></span></p>
<p>One guy was an Iranian Muslim. He said his father was very religious and used to pray his morning services for three hours. It only takes a few minutes for most people, but his father was so pious that it took him hours. Then he told me the entire story of Muhammad. He said his father had great respect for Jewish people and used to study the Torah. This fellow is not Muslim. He claims he is &#8220;everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then there was the film student from Boston. She recently came to LA as part of a program with Boston University. Earlier that day her mother was guilting her about where she was going to go to hear the Shofar on Rosh Hashanah. So she told her mom she didn&#8217;t know yet, but she was definitely going to services &#8220;on the beach&#8221;. She had never even heard of shul but when she saw the shul she said it was &#8220;<em>beshert</em>&#8220;! Now she is planning on joining us for services. Her mother will be happy.</p>
<p>My third encounter was with an Intactvist across the way. He gets his own post. Tune in tomorrow for my conversation with the Venice Boardwalk Intactivist.</p>
<p>The High Holidays are a magical time everywhere. But at The Shul on the Beach they are particularly inspiring. Jews from every walk of life, with every level of observance, and of every background join together for services. Everyone is welcome and everyone is made to feel welcome. We invite you to join us.</p>
<p><strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> is September 16 at sundown through nightfall on September 18. Shofar blowing at The Shul on the Beach will be around 11 AM on September 17 and 18.</p>
<p><strong>Yom Kippur</strong> is September 25 at sundown for K0l Nidre through nightfall on September 26.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to join us for services whether for the entire thing or just a few moments. If you want a seat with your name on it, call or email the PJC office at info@pjcenter.com.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://Daf.finkorswim.com"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6092" title="wasserzeichen-projekte.php_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wasserzeichen-projekte.php_-300x100.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="100" /></a>As I mentioned previously, (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/07/31/ode-to-the-siyum-hashas/">Ode to the Siyum HaShas</a>) the Siyum HaShas is a great source of inspiration for me and for many others.  The simplest way to channel that inspiration is to attempt to join the hundreds of thousands of Daf Yomi learners as the program begins from the start of the Talmud on Thursday.</p>
<p>I want to count myself among the many Daf Yomi students and would also like my shul to be a place where Daf Yomi is studied. I also love learning and teaching Talmud. So we have formulated and implemented a Daf Yomi plan at <a href="pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a> and we are including all of you.</p>
<p>I have set up a new site at <a href="http://daf.finkorswim.com" target="_blank">Daf.Finkorswim.com</a>.<span id="more-6091"></span> On that site I will be posting videos and podcasts of every daf. The live classes are being held in advance of the daf schedule so they will be available online on the daf schedule. You can subscribe to the YouTube Channel for the videos or to the podcasts in iTunes, or just visit the site daily. The daf podcasts are separate from the non-daf podcasts. Hopefully we can keep pace and hopefully the online community will make use of the site.</p>
<p>The style of the class will be a fast paced run through the daf. The assumption will be that you do not need any prior Talmud experience to understand the class or appreciate the material. I hope to keep each class between 20-30 minutes. There are many resources on other sites if you want to go more in depth, my idea is to make it as simple and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>So, if you are interested in joining the Daf Yomi program I have made it pretty easy to do from the comfort of your home, your car, your lunch break, wherever, and I hope you will avail yourself to the new site. If you have any suggestions please send them my way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tombstone.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5719" title="tombstone" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tombstone-300x178.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="178" /></a>An older, single gentleman in my shul lost his mother last year. We both flew to New York for the funeral in West Babylon on Long Island, where my father and father-in-law met us with a minyan of my personal friends and family who took 5 hours out of their time to participate in the mitzvah of giving proper honor to the dead. The surviving son had no friends and (welcome) family in New York (although one relative couple did crash the funeral just to make trouble) and the effort these people made to be at the funeral was really appreciated.</p>
<p>This week, we arranged for an unveiling and once again I was responsible to find a minyan. While an unveiling can be done without a minyan, the gentleman really wanted to say kaddish at his mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s graves, especially because he rarely makes the trip from Los Angeles to New York. As it were, both my father and father in law were unable to arrange their schedules to join us. I had one friend who was able to come and one brother in law who was able to be there as well.</p>
<p>That left us six people short.</p>
<p>So I took to social media. I posted a notice on Facebook and Twitter. I got a lot of responses. It was really encouraging and I thought it was great that we could use the Internet for chessed.<span id="more-5718"></span> Most people wanted to know what I needed help doing and when I told them, they were unable to make the trip. That was fine and I appreciated their interest and that they reached out to me.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to find six people. Notices were placed on community lists. They generated no interest. No one was interested in making the trip.</p>
<p>Only three people volunteered to come and were actually able to make the trip. These three people shared one thing. They were all Jewish men who were orthodox (or chasidic) in the younger years and had made the choice to leave orthodox Judaism later on in life.</p>
<p>I was thrilled to have these three volunteers and two of them even offered to bring friends along. One friend was able to come and the other could not. So I had four volunteers. All ex-orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>It was well after midnight the night before the 11 AM ceremony and I was frantic on gChat trying to find a couple more people. I asked a few people directly if they could please do me a favor and come to the unveiling. Luckily my new friend Dovid Teitlebaum was willing to make the trip and bring a couple teenage guys.<em> [Thank you SO MUCH, Dovid. You really saved me!]</em> I had my minyan.</p>
<p>Of the eleven people who I was expecting, 10 made it on time(-ish). The eleventh guy miscalculated his travel time. But he made it just as we were wrapping things up. We did the ceremony. Everyone was very respectful and played their role perfectly. The gentleman was so appreciative and so was I. It meant a lot to both of us that we were able to arrange a minyan.</p>
<p>It was especially meaningful that some people volunteered to take time out of their day to make a minyan. It was interesting that the volunteers were no longer orthodox Jews.</p>
<p><em>[I could end here and let you draw your own conclusions and formulate your own thoughts. But I will continue and share what I am thinking.]</em></p>
<p>Orthodox Jews, as has been well documented, are overwhelmingly charitable with their time and money. Usually, orthodox Jews can be counted on for acts of selfless kindness that go well beyond what is normal. So what happened here?</p>
<p>It could just be that this was an anomaly. Or that no one wants to help me because they don&#8217;t like me. Who knows?</p>
<p>But I have a little theory. Halacha drives so much of orthodox Jewish life. In halacha there is no need for a minyan at an unveiling. Therefore, making the minyan for an unveiling is not looked at as such a priority. Other concerns take precedent in the hierarchy of halacha. That is fine. I don&#8217;t have a problem with that.</p>
<p>It just strikes me that when one takes halacha out of the calculation, making this minyan clearly meant a lot to this gentleman and to me. Forget about halacha for a second. It was clearly a really nice thing to do. It clearly would have made this gentleman feel so good. It clearly would have helped me. It seems so obvious that helping making the minyan was a good and nice and helpful and generous thing to do.</p>
<p>So, I think sometimes it takes someone outside the system to see past the trees and notice the forest. But it reminds us that we, who are meticulous about halacha, can&#8217;t forget to see the forest as well. Would I have volunteered if someone I knew or barely knew asked for my help making a minyan for an unveiling? Probably not.</p>
<p>Have these four men inspired me to say yes next time? Yes they have. Absolutely.</p>
<p>So <strong>Joshie</strong>, <strong>Yitzchok</strong>, <strong>Aly</strong>, and <strong>Abe</strong>, thank you for being the volunteers and making the minyan, but most of all thank you for reminding me to see the forest, not just the trees and inspiring me to say YES next time I can do a nice thing for someone else.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Once again, Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach found itself on network television as the backdrop for a scene in NCIS Los Angeles. I have no idea what is happening here or what the show is about, but it certainly looks exciting. Not sure if they knocked on the door for a minyan either.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Shabbos services are definitely exciting, but usually the cops don&#8217;t show up.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to everyone who told me about this.</p>

<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-27-at-2.55.17-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5326" title="Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach New Girl Screenshot" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-Shot-2012-03-27-at-2.55.17-PM-1024x575.png" alt="" width="675" height="380" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Several people who watch the Fox Television show New Girl let me know that our shul was in the frame for a few seconds. Very cool. Here is your proof!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Venice Beach was the key prop in a scene where one character (Jess) tries to help another character (Schmidt) relax. There is no where in the world to find more relaxed people than Venice Beach. It&#8217;s a great place to let go of your troubles. Although, the drum circle people who are dancing in the show bear little resemblance to the actual drum circle people. Clearly, casting preferred to portray them as a group of  people with above average looks who don&#8217;t need a shower. This is not entirely accurate.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you need a Shabbos of relaxation come to see us on Venice Beach.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">(Watch the episode here: <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/338585/new-girl-control#s-p1-so-i0" target="_blank">Hulu</a>)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>On behalf of Pacific Jewish Center  | The Shul on the Beach we wish everyone a joyous and happy Purim. Revel responsibly!</p>
<p>Here are a couple photos of the PJC Mishloach Manos and the accompanying poem. Special thanks to my wife Tova for designing the Mishloach Manos and all the helpers who put the bags together. Enjoy!<span id="more-5253"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_0673.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5254 aligncenter" title="IMG_0673" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_0673-e1331227711953-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_0676.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5256 aligncenter" title="IMG_0676" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_0676-e1331227793974-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">From time to time, people like to take a trip to the beach<br />
They go as far as they can, until the shore they reach</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Everyone takes a bag when they go on a little trip<br />
Whether going for some sun or a little dip</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our Pacific Jewish Center bag is packed for a picnic lunch<br />
With lots of goodies to snack on and things to munch</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We are the famous Shul on the Beach, with a unique position<br />
Helping us spread the light of Hashem’s Torah is our mission</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thousands walk by our shul searching for something, every week<br />
For the special ones who join us, it is inspiration they seek</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But everyone lbenefits from the shul’s presence as a reminder<br />
That as lost as someone might be, there is also always a Finder</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We elevate the boardwalk from pure materialism to something higher<br />
It is a model of Kiddush Hashem and our power to inspire</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Just like the Purim story takes a tale of seemingly coincidence and chance<br />
And transforms it to a joyous and spiritual holiday of love, friendship, song, and dance</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By our acts and commitment we transform the spiritual wasteland outside<br />
The good must be victorious when spiritual and material worlds collide</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Similarly we transform simple picnic foods like meat, condiments, and beer<br />
Into a holy mitzvah that lifts spirits and brings good cheer</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Let’s take this Purim lesson and continue to teach the world its truth<br />
It shall be known everywhere, take this world and make it holy, every adult and every youth</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Happy Purim</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>From your friends at Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/choir_logo.jpeg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5118" title="choir_logo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/choir_logo.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="141" /></a>Yesterday I had the privilege of attending a historic event. The new building of a synagogue in Los Angeles, to be more precise, North Beverly Hills, opened its doors for the first time. Young Israel of North Beverly Hills dedicated their new shul at an inspiring ceremony.</p>
<p>Founding President of Pacific Jewish Center, Michael Medved was the Master of Ceremonies for a speaking lineup that included members of congress and local government. The keynote address was magnificently delivered by Chief Rabbi, Lord Jonathan Sacks.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful event and a ceremony befitting such an auspicious day.</p>
<p>The highlight for me was the live performance by the Shabbaton Choir. They sang several stirring songs and had the crowd buzzing. They were phenomenal. Their style is a mix of cantorial and chamber music that is not often associated with Jewish music. Most people think of Klezmer music as the Jewish music standard. Others, from Sephardic backgrounds think of middle-eastern music as Jewish music. Orthodox Jews in the 21st century think of the pseudo-pop-rock Jewish music as Jewish music.</p>
<p>The Shabbaton Choir has a different take. It is a beautiful take too.<span id="more-5114"></span></p>
<p>Here is one song they sang yesterday that I really loved.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/1jsseGcvVrw?start=36" frameborder="0" width="480" height="360"></iframe></p>
<p>As you can see and hear, this is not typical Jewish music by any commonly held definition of Jewish music.</p>
<p>I think there is a unique quality to this kind of music that is lacking in the other forms of Jewish music, at least to my ears. This certainly applies to the pseudo-pop-rock version of music that is most prevalent in orthodox circles. The other Jewish music is mostly marketed as an alternative to non-Jewish music. It&#8217;s entertainment. The music is designed to distract, keep one busy, lighten a mood, or inspire. The music does not feel like an end to itself, rather it is a means to some other purpose. That&#8217;s fine. I have no problem with it and I even enjoy it from time to time (-usually the older stuff).</p>
<p>But Shabbaton is doing something different, at least that&#8217;s how it feels to me. They are using the music as worship. The music is not being used to inspire. It is the act of singing that is fulfilling a need to serve God. In other words, the singing is for its own sake. To sing. The music is uplifting, but I don&#8217;t think that is their purpose. I think they are singing as an act of praise to serve and love God. That&#8217;s very different.</p>
<p>It reminded me of something I wrote about here: <a title="Permanent link to Book Review | Sacred Trash: The Lost and Found World of the Cairo Geniza" href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/17/book-review-sacred-trash-the-lost-and-found-world-of-the-cairo-geniza/" rel="bookmark">Book Review | Sacred Trash</a></p>
<p>Throughout the centuries, Jews have developed various social ways of expressing themselves as they worship God. [Please read what I wrote in <a title="Permanent link to Book Review | Sacred Trash: The Lost and Found World of the Cairo Geniza" href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/17/book-review-sacred-trash-the-lost-and-found-world-of-the-cairo-geniza/" rel="bookmark">Book Review | Sacred Trash</a> in the last couple of paragraphs for a fuller explanation of this idea.] The Shabbaton Choir is using their song in this manner. Their singing is like the Talmud study of the yeshiva student or the meditations of the chasid. I love the idea of singing as worship and I love the perfect execution of this idea by the Shabbaton choir.</p>
<p>It is a joy to experience first hand. I encourage you to experience it for yourself as well. Their music is available on iTunes and they have some videos on YouTube.</p>

He asked if he could take pictures of us at The Shul on the Beach.</p>
<p>Normally, there is not much to photograph on weekdays and we would not be comfortable with someone taking pictures. Last time we had photographers in our shul it was Purim. It was an interesting time to take pictures but hardly a &#8220;typical day&#8221; in the life of an orthodox Jew. But it does make for a spectacular presentation. If you have not already seen it &#8211; please check that out over here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/19/pacific-jewish-center-featured-on-msnbc-com/">Pacific Jewish Center Featured on MSNBC.com</a></p>
<p>I told the caller that the only chance I thought he had of photographing something worthwhile would be Hoshana Rabbah, the next day, at 7 AM. I told him about the Four Species and the circuits around the Bima. He said he would be there. We had a date.</p>
<p>Below you will see a slideshow of some of the photos he took at The Shul on the Beach that morning. The photography is outstanding and really captures the services. I hope Jason&#8217;s documentary is a success and appreciate the time and effort he put into these photos. We also really appreciate his sharing them with us.</p>
<p>Thank you Jason!</p>
<p>Enjoy.<span id="more-4764"></span></p>

<p>Betty Matoff was returned to her Maker after more than 106 years on Earth. It was an honor to have known her and an honor to have had a role at her funeral. I led a chapter of Psalms and spoke very briefly to tribute Betty&#8217;s memory.</p>
<p>It is not often that one meets a person that is larger than life. Betty was that. Her energy was infectious, her smile was legendary, her mind was quick, her wit was entertaining, her love for life and for people was endless, her generosity was limitless.</p>
<p>All of that in a tiny 106 year old body.</p>
<p>In my brief remarks I said that the hours that I spend with Betty will always be memories that I cherish. Some of those moments have been the best moments of my life. I want to thank Betty for including Pacific Jewish Center and me in her life. It was a true privilege to have known her.<span id="more-4609"></span></p>
<p>Betty left no children, grandchildren or great grandchildren. Betty had no peers to come to her funeral. How many centenarians are living in LA? Yet, the funeral home was full of loved ones who came to pay their respects for our Aunt Betty. Aside from our memories of her, Betty leaves behind a legacy of charity, good deeds and life lessons taught to us all.</p>
<p>We can all strive to emulate the greatness we saw in Betty. I know that none of us will ever be able replace her in this world, but perhaps if we all make an extra effort to live up to the ideals that she exemplified, we can serve as somewhat of a comfort to each other as we mourn the loss of our dear friend and role model, Betty Matoff.</p>
<p><em>May her memory be for blessing.</em></p>

<p>A beautiful cross-section of Jews from around the world enjoyed the lovely musical intonations of Ron Grun. Pacific Jewish Center members showed up to the concert in strong numbers. But the non-members who joined us for the event made the concert even more special.</p>
<p>On another typical Venice Beach Sunday, dozens of folks popped their heads into the shul. Some stayed for the entire concert. Others made stayed briefly.</p>
<p>But everyone enjoyed. Once again, we were proud to spread the light of Torah and Judaism to the Venice Boardwalk community.</p>
<p>It was wonderful meeting all the people who stopped in for some of the concert and I hope we see you again soon.</p>
<p>OUR NEXT EVENT will be an art gallery over Labor Day weekend. Admission will be free.</p>
<p>We hope to see you then.</p>
<p>Thank you to the Goldstein family for sponsoring the Klezmer Concert again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TikkunOlam_3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4492" title="TikkunOlam_3" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TikkunOlam_3.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="276" /></a>In what has become a bit of a famous op-ed in on JTA.org, Joel Alperson, a non-orthodox Jew, has written a powerful call to arms for the non-orthodox communities.</p>
<p>I am orthodox, so his words apparently are not directed at me and my co-religionists. Or perhaps they are&#8230;</p>
<p>Alperson writes that Judaism for the non-orthodox has become too much about tikkun olam (social justice) and too little about building Jewish communities. He opines that in order to maintain a Jewish community, the focus of the community cannot be about social / political issues. It must be about religion. Tikkun olam must be an ingredient in modern Jewish life, but it cannot be the focus, lest we lose our direction completely and divest Judaism from all of its religious underpinnings.</p>
<p>He writes that Jewish education is more important than tikkun olam and the non-orthodox are losing their Judaism because of ignorance and complacency.<span id="more-4491"></span> In his view, Judaism, even if not orthodox, can help people become better people, for themselves, not just to help everyone else.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Judaism teaches us how to be better friends, businesspeople, husbands, wives and philanthropists. It tells us how to help the weak and when to fight evil. In short, Judaism done right makes us better human beings. It is the discipline of leading a traditional Jewish life that also reminds us how best to engage in repairing the world.</em></p>
<p>Of course, orthodox Jews have been saying this forever. We agree. Perhaps, this would give orthodox Jews a feather in the cap. We are winning. They know it. Tee-hee! Ding-dong the witch is dead!</p>
<p>But I think that orthodox Jews also have a role to play in this. In general, there are two ways that orthodox Jews view the non-orthodox: 1) persona non grata 2) kiruv prospect.</p>
<p>This is undertandable for a variety of social and religious reasons. I am not here to say this approach is absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>But I would like to propose a third view that may help us and the non-orthodox. The third view assumes that many non-orthodox would like and do enjoy religious experiences that can be shared with orthodox Jews. Some orthodox shuls (like <a href="pjecnter.com">Pacific Jewish Center</a>) appeal to non-orthodox Jews even though the services and rabbi and majority of community members are orthodox. The non-orthodox can share in the experience, attend shul, enjoy the kiddush, join for a Shabbos meal but with no kiruv subtext. It is purely for the sake of sharing a common religious experience.</p>
<p>If, as Alperson writes, non-orthodox Jews should be participating in more religious activities and they do. It would great if this could help foster a greater mutual respect and understanding between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews. There does not need to be a &#8220;my way or the highway&#8221; approach, nor does there need to any proselytizing. Simply Jews with different backgrounds, beliefs and opinions sharing a religious experience.</p>
<p>It works well for us at PJC. I hope and pray, more orthodox institutions and communities can follow our lead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Despite unccoperative weather, Purim at the Shul on the Beach was enjoyed by all. As a community we performed all the mitzvos of the day.</p>
<p>Beginning with the packing of Mishloach Manos on the Fast of Esther we spent time together celebrating one of the joyous periods of the Jewish calendar. The packing event was a success. Firstly because the Mishloach Manos got packed. But more importantly, those who attended connected to each other through a mitzva and that is a special connection. I need to thank my wife <strong>Tova</strong> for designing, ordering and creating the entire custom Mishloach Manos as well as organizing and compiling the PJC Yam Yam Salad Cookbook that was printed and included in every Mishloach Manos package.</p>
<p>After Shabbos we collected Matanos L&#8217;evyonim and heard the megilla read beautifully by <strong>Hillel Philip</strong> while many were dressed in their Purim costumes. He did an excellent job and we celebrated with Hamentashen after the reading. During Purim day, the Mishloach Manos were delivered by PJC volunteers spearheaded by <strong>Alan Danziger</strong> with the assistance of <strong>Leslie Friedman</strong>. It wasn&#8217;t easy to do in the rain, but all the packages were delivered. In the afternoon we had a party for the community which was deliciously catered by <strong>Mr. Pickles </strong>and organized by <strong>Jeff Liss</strong> with some assistance by <strong>Frederic Eger</strong>. It was a lot of fun to celebrate the joy of Purim together. If not for the inclement weather I am sure many more neighobrs and passers-by on the boardwalk would have joined us. But it was pouring rain and the boardwalk was deserted.</p>
<p>They missed and we enjoyed a great show by Alula. We danced, sang, ate and reveled through the afternoon. Purim at the Shul on the Beach was a wonderful kiddush Hashem and we hope next year we will be blessed with better weather and some more guests from outside the community.</p>
<p>Enjoy the photos of the packing and party below:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/5714.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3963" title="5714" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/5714-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Yesterday, Wyatt Cenac of the Daily Show with Jon Stewart did a really funny and slightly sad video on the status of the Westhampton Eruv on Long Island. Apparently, there is some opposition that is non-sensical, bigoted and pathetically transparent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad to see that the primary opposition to the eruv is from a yiddish speaking Jew. It&#8217;s also sad to see him so thoroughly embarrassed in the clip. I actually feel bad for the guy as much of a jerk he seems in the clip&#8230;</p>
<p>At the Pacific Jewish Center, we have faced similar opposition to our proposed eruv. And by similar I mean, coming from Jews and equally self contradictory. It is our hope that we will pick up the eruv project for Santa Monica, Venice and Marina del Rey in the near future.</p>
<p>I hope Westhampton gets their eruv and I hope we get ours soon as well. Some commentary below the clip.<span id="more-3961"></span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, an eruv is technically not a loophole. I explained in brief here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/11/the-good-wife-unorthodox-from-a-rabbi-law-student-perspective/">The Good Wife: Unorthodox, From a Rabbi / Law Student Perspective</a> that an eruv is not a loophole. Here is what it is (and this is good for people who actually don&#8217;t know and people who need to explain to people who don&#8217;t know):</p>
<p>The prohibition against carrying on Shabbos is from a private domain to a public domain or a second private domain. One IS permitted to carry within their own home. One is permitted to carry within their own enclosed property (eg: a yard surrounded by a fence). One is permitted to carry from inside their home to their enclosed outdoor property as well. The function of the eruv (which unlike the not so funny joke during the clip does not mean loophole, it means mixture) is to mix / connect many domains into one LARGE private domain. All that is required is a SYMBOLIC enclosure that is halachically considered a wall. A wire running from two poles is sufficient to create a symbolic halachic wall.</p>
<p>Thus, when a wire surrounds a large area that has been designated as a single private domain, joining all the private domains therein into ONE domain, obviously carrying is permitted within that one domain. There are some requirements that need to be met for the large domain to include the private domains. If those requirements are met and there is a unification of many domains via a symbolic, halachic wall, one may carry within that domain exactly as they can carry from room to room within one&#8217;s own home.</p>
<p>Second of all, like I said, it is sad to see Jews pitted against each other. Though, I can&#8217;t assign all blame to the fellow who is against having Orthodox Jewish neighbors. Sometimes Orthodox Jews don&#8217;t make the best neighbors. I don&#8217;t mean this is in an entirely negative way. It&#8217;s normal for Orthodox Jews not to be completely neighborly with their less religious neighbors. They have different standards and different priorities. It can get messy. All I mean to say is that we should be conscious of the opinions of our neighbors and be even more scrupulous to be the best neighbors possible. If we would do that, I am sure we would be less resistance from others to moving to their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Third of all, we see most clearly how ugly bigotry looks when it affects us personally. It is important to try to avoid these kinds of bigoted remarks and behavior in relation to others. Especially after we see how it feels to be a victim of that bigotry. Please keep that in mind next time you say / hear a blanket, statement that could be construed as racist, bigoted, small minded or hateful.</p>

<p>There are a few seminal events that are rare, exhilarating and emotional in the life of a Rabbi. One of those events is the dedication of a new Torah scroll. And yesterday I was fortunate to be a part of a wonderful Torah Dedication ceremony and celebration.</p>
<p><strong>Randy</strong> and <strong>Deeana Frankel</strong> are celebrating the Bnei Mitzvah of their son <strong>Zev</strong> and their daughter <strong>Ariella</strong>. They chose to commemorate this milestone by restoring a Torah scroll rescued from the Holocaust. During a small, intimate ceremony, that Torah scroll has been placed in the Ark at the Shul on the Beach and we could not be more proud.</p>
<p>The ceremony was the typical Torah dedication with one small exception. The standard procession took place on the Venice Boardwalk.<span id="more-3467"></span> Hundreds of people stopped to watch, photograph, record video and enjoy the celebration. It was clearly inspirational for many of the observers to see such excitement and honor given to the Torah. It was a real kiddush Hashem.</p>
<p>We danced on the boardwalk with the Torah for a little while then proceeded into the Shul where we placed the Torah in its new home in the Ark. Following the ceremony we enjoyed a lovely catered lunch. During the lunch Randy spoke for a few minutes. I also addressed the guests for a few minutes and you can hear both speeches by clicking the play button below.</p>
<p>This morning, we used the Torah for the first time as we read from the Torah as part of morning services. It was very powerful to call Randy to the Torah to make the blessing on the Torah using his very own Torah.</p>
<p>The event was very inspirational for me and something I will never forget. Not all rabbis are lucky enough to participate in a Torah dedication ceremony and I thank the Frankels for making me a lucky rabbi!</p>
<p>I had a few photos taken of the procession. The Frankels had a professional photographer who can certainly put these photos to shame but the celebration was so special and so unique that I wanted to share these photos with everyone.</p>

<p>This past week we were honored to meet fellow Law Student / Blogger / Jew(ess): Skylar / Chavi of <a href="http://crazyjewishconvert.blogspot.com/">You&#8217;re Not Crazy</a> fame. And what a wonderful guest she was. Our Shabbos was definitely better thanks to her and we appreciate her visit.</p>
<p>It seems Chavi had some things to say about her Shabbos experience in Venice. See <a href="http://crazyjewishconvert.blogspot.com/2010/12/crashing-venice-ca-for-shabbat.html">Crashing Venice, CA, for Shabbat!</a></p>
<p>My only regret was not spending more time with Skylar. Hopefully next time!</p>
<p>(Special thanks to <strong>Liz Danziger</strong> for making all the arrangements for Skylar.)</p>

<p>As the ambassadors of Judaism on the Venice Beach boardwalk, we are charged with the resonsibility and opportunity to provide a Jewish experience to the myriad of Jews and non-Jews who pass our shul on a daily basis.</p>
<p>To that end, we provided an open house Chanukah party. Many passers-by came inside to partake in the spiritual and physical warmth of our shul and its members. Our community made a kiddush Hashem and I am proud of our Chanukah party.</p>
<p>Special kudos<span id="more-3430"></span> are in order for <strong>Jeff Liss</strong> who organized the entire shebang and to <strong>Rabbi Mintz</strong> for manning the doors of the Shul and inviting anyone who was interested into the shul. Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>Josh Blum</strong> snatched my camera as soon as I walked into the shul. The pictures that tell the story of our Chanukah party are his and we appreciate his talents (as well as being an integral member of the community) thanks Josh!</p>
<p>I also want to thank everyone who came to the party and participated in the festivities. Your presence was noted and appreciated.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal has a nice piece on Dr. Jonathan Halpert. He is the YU basketball coach of 39 years. That is a long time to be doing any job. Certainly in a field dominated by the coaching carousel, it is a worthy achievement.</p>
<p>The article is nice. It tells of the challenges of managing a team of Orthodox Jewish basketball players. Shabbos and Holidays are off limits to games and practices. The daily grind of a YU student includes religious studies until mid afternoon and then secular classes that can go until 8 PM.</p>
<p>Halpert gives the reader insight into his coaching and life philosophy and as a reader I found him to be inspiring.<span id="more-3420"></span></p>
<p>In the article, there is one anecdote about making an impact on a player&#8217;s life.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There was the player who was cut but served as team manager for a year, made the squad the following season and hit a game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. Dr. Halpert made five DVDs of the game for the player to show to his children. &#8220;That&#8217;s good to keep you going another five years,&#8221; he said.</em></p>
<p>A nice story. But even nicer because I happen to know that player.</p>
<p>That player is Aryeh Magilnick. Son of PJC members <strong>Judd</strong> and <strong>Denise Magilnick</strong>.</p>
<p>And I happen to know what shot Halpert was referring to. And now you do too.</p>
<p>Click the video to watch Aryeh Magilnick hit a classic buzzer beater. (Assume there is a buzzer and that the shot was released just before the buzzer sounded.)</p>

We are proud of our diversity and it strengthens our community to be inclusive and foster relationships with a variety of people. Within our shul there are Jews of every flavor. There are those who identify as Ashkenaz, Sefard, Lubavitch, Reform, Conservative, Modern Orthodox, Centrist Orthodox, Yeshivish as well as some converts. It really is unique.</p>
<p>Many of the young men and women who grew up in the community before I became the rabbi have gone on to achieve great things in their lives. Some are professionals, some are studying Torah day and night, some are academics and some have become big &#8220;baalei chessed&#8221; (pracitioners of unabated love and kindness). The baalei chessed are probably the unsung heroes of the group. They are humble and do their good works quietly, without fanfare and without seeking recognition.</p>
<p>One of those young women, is <strong>Jesse Risch</strong>,<span id="more-3278"></span> daugher of (Board Member) <strong>Alan</strong> and <strong>Rachel Risch</strong>. Jesse Risch is working in Thailand with the American Jewish World Service (<a href="http://www.awjs.org" target="_blank">www.awjs.org</a>). The AWJS is similar to the Peace Corps. I asked Jesse why she was going to Thailand and what she is going to be doing there. She has been in Thailand for a few weeks now and this was her response to me before she left.</p>
<p>In her own words (with a little editing):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I&#8217;m participating in the volunteer service corps which places volunteers from all over the world with organizations (NGOs) in developing countries for a period of three months to a year. They have other programs as well to spur development in growing nations, namely a year-long service corps and a few alternative spring break trips for college students/young professionals.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I&#8217;m going to Southeast Asia to work with a youth organization that focuses on empowering and educating Burmese refugee youth, status-less, displaced persons in Thailand that are restricted from accessing public education and health services. Refugee populations tend to be at high risk for [sex] trafficking as well as HIV/Aids and unwanted pregnancies. I am particularly interested in this aspect of the work- helping educate and empower youth to give them hope and the ability to prosper, rather than fall victim to the aforementioned.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I will specifically be working with the organization&#8217;s staff to help them build up capacity- reviewing their programs and curriculum, conducting development/fundraising efforts, and teaching them English.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The American Jewish World Service is driven by the Jewish concept of tikkun olam- and that it is our collective responsibility to help heal the world. This is my own guiding motto as well, and I whole heartedly believe that as Jews we have this obligation to help others, even those outside of our own community, and outside of our comfort zone. I&#8217;m really excited to have the opportunity to take part in this type of work.</em></p>
<p>I can speak for myself and the entire community when I say that Jesse is doing great work and I salute her. Life is long enough that we can take the time to contribute some of our time to those less fortunate than us. Even if we don&#8217;t go all the way to Thailand, there are people in our lives that could use a little help now and then. We can all find to time to help others and follow in the footsteps of Jesse who is blazing the trail of chessed for all of us.</p>
<p>On a side note, I think this is a wonderful way for young men and women to spend a few months. Most orthodox Jewish high school graduates spend at least one year in Israel. Wouldn&#8217;t it be great if more of them participated in a program like this as well? I think so.</p>
<p>I hope to post a report from Jesse in the next few months. In the meantime, Jesse, keep up the great work!</p>
<p>Here is a video of the AWJS doing work in India:</p>

One of the more interesting people I have met in my Shul is Audi Gozlan.</p>
<p>Audi is an orthodox Jewish Yogi (also a lawyer) from Montreal Canada. He visits Venice on a regular basis to try and satisfy the local thirst for innovative and exciting Yoga programs. Audi teaches a discipline of Yoga that he personally developed called Kabalah Yoga.</p>
<p>Kabalah Yoga has become quite popular and Audi session&#8217;s are packed with instructors who want to teach Kabalah Yoga. Some sessions have upwards of 200 people in attendance. The attendees are usually quite surprised when they see Audi. He looks very religious and they start to think they are in the wr0ng place. But when Audi starts his session, they are shocked to see this man in a kipa and silver beard contort his body like a skilled Yogi.<span id="more-3150"></span></p>
<p>The poses of Kabalah Yoga are in the shape of the letters of the Hebrew Aleph-Bet. The letters of the Hebrew Aleph-Bet have been interpreted in many ways. There is an entire corpus of study that uses the letters, their shapes, their sounds and their numerical values as tools for unlocking Torah secrets.</p>
<p>Audi is using them to unlock secrets of the human body.</p>
<p>I confess to never having participated in one of Audi&#8217;s sessions. But from what I hear, they are incredible. In Canada, a prime time Cable television show is being produced starring Audi and Kabalah Yoga. We may get it in the United States before long as well.</p>
<p>If you have any interest in Yoga in general I am sure you will find Audi&#8217;s website and videos fascinating.</p>
<p>If you want more information, check out Kabalah Yoga at <a href="http://www.kabalahyoga.com/" target="_blank">http://www.kabalahyoga.com/</a> and on Facebook <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Kabalah-Yoga/189918567398" target="_blank">on their page</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a very cool (well produced) sample video.</p>

<h2>Avram&#8217;s Journey</h2>
<h2>Lech Lecha 2009</h2>
<p>The Torah begins the story of our forefather Avraham in this week’s parsha. Thus begins the story of the Jewish people. The first Jew begins his journey in Lech Lecha and that journey defines us for all time. We still feel the effects of that journey. The better we can understand and appreciate that journey, the better we can understand and appreciate ourselves and our personal journey.</p>
<p>God commands Avram (not yet named Avraham) to go. “Lech Lecha” means to go. If we analyze the Torah’s words there is more than meets the eye. The Torah says that GD commands Avram: “Go from your land, from your birthplace and from your father’s home.” If all the Torah wanted us to know was that Hashem had commanded Avram to leave or to go, it would have been sufficient to say “lech” or “tzei” – go.<span id="more-3101"></span> Further, the entire section that mentions leaving his land, birthplace and home is superfluous. And it is in the wrong order! First one leaves one’s home, then one’s birthplace or city, and only then does one leave his land or country.</p>
<p>R’ Hirsch says that the word lech comes from the word halach. And that word is related to Chelek, divided and chalak which means smooth, a surface to which nothing adheres. So halach means to go but it connotes separation as well. Sometimes one can separate for the purpose of going to another place, but in this case, the separating was lecha – for Avram’s self.</p>
<p>Avram is separating from three things: Eretz / country, moledes / hometown, and bayis / home. R’ Hirsch says that these three things form the foundation for one’s personality and true essence. Eretz, the country or nationality with all its moral implications. Eretz is like eres – married.  Eres also means cradle. In comparison to  shamayim (heaven) which is sham (over there), the land, our country gives us our cradle in which we learn our morality. Our land gives us national characteristics and the tremendous power of participation in a nation.</p>
<p>Moledes, birthplace, gives us civic position and independence Even narrower is the bayis, the home where we find our individuality and we grow as unique people.</p>
<p>These Hebrew words make it clear that the Torah values the worth of one’s home and homeland. The Torah is not belittling these concepts by asking Avram to isolate from them. Rather, the Torah is telling us the value of these realms and the greatness of the isolation GD demanded from Avram.</p>
<p>In fact, these demands place Avram in direct conflict with the strongest ideals of his era. Centralism was the prevalent tendency of his age. The feared monarch Nimrod, from whom Avram was running, led the Tower of Babel campaign. That campaign was marked by the slogan of “naaseh lanu shem” – we can make ourselves a name. The tower was to represent the community in general for the glory of mankind. This tendency begot an erroneous conception of a majority which has sway in every direction and every case. And eventually, what is honored by the majority ipso facto becomes the thing that is honored by everybody.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that the majority opinion should be well represented in the community and it should represent that which is highest and holiest by everybody. And in Judaism we would expect the same. Still at the very start of the Jewish journey we are taught: Lech Lecha, go for yourself. Stand on your own, separated from the crowd. No one should limit him or herself to the majority. You cannot be only as honest as everybody else, or as moral as everybody else. We must rise above the majority.</p>
<p>Each person is responsible to GD for himself and if necessary to be alone with GD if he can find no partners with whom to worship. This is what GD demanded from Avram at the start of his journey and the start of our collective journey. The beautiful insights into Hebrew language show us how important eretz, molad and bayis are to us and lech lecha tells us that they are only trumped by the bond that attaches us to GD.</p>
<p>There are always those who say that Judaism should be current and up to date with modern ideals. There are some modern ideals that are consistent with Torah; perhaps social conventions caused them to be ignored until they became prevalent in a modern world. We should and must celebrate those ideals. But, Avram’s first stand was not in accordance with the ancient cultures with whom he lived. While the whole world sought every effort to establish themselves; as civilizations became more complex, Avram was giving up his citizenship and his homeland. He protested the idol worship of the other nations. He separated from it all.</p>
<p>Avram was appointed the first Jew, but he had to prove himself first. He had to prove that he could rise up above the fray and be separate. Avram showed us by example.</p>
<p>Our country, our city, our homes all represent inertia. When we revert to the comfort of habits, customs, and thoughts that we are accustomed to, we are relying too heavily on our cradle that we were raised in. We often fail to move forward because of fear or doubt. Hashem tells Avram, Lech Lecha, do what is right. Do what you know you must do to ensure that you will be separate, that you will be elevated and above the customs and traditions into which you were born.</p>
<p>The lesson of lech lecha is that we must act with conviction and that we must act with a trust and hope for future. Avram could have been reluctant to leave all that he left behind. After all one’s country, hometown and home cane be good values, our core values in fact. But sometimes we need to rise above our complacency and elevate ourselves to heights that can only come when we act with the conviction of lech lecha and we make a substantial break from our inertia and instead act in a way that will bond even more strongly with our families, our neighborhoods, our homelands and above all with GD</p>
<p>In our lives we are called upon to make that same choice so many times. What are my priorities? What is the deciding factor in my decisions?</p>
<p>Avram was also faced with tough choices. How did he respond? What was GD’s call to him? Choose GD, above all. Choose spirituality and Torah above all.</p>
<p>Lech Lecha tells us that our homeland, our city and our homes are all important. They all have tremendous value, but ultimately the choice that is right is the choice that will bind us closest to GD. The choice that brings us the greatest spiritual growth and opportunity to sanctify the name of GD is the right choice. That is the call of Lech Lecha.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/4940039507_f479ee509d.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2778" title="Pacific Jewish Center The Shul on the Beach" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/4940039507_f479ee509d-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>At Pacific Jewish Center we endeavor to share the light Judaism with the entire Beach Community. As we approach the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashana, the least we could do was wish the Venice Boardwalk a collective Shana Tova (A Good Year) to all the passersby.</p>
<p>So I set up shop outside the Shul on the Beach on a Sunday afternoon. Literally thousands of people pass the Shul on a beautiful summer Sunday like yesterday. I started all alone, but was eventually joined by Shul Co-President Alan Danziger and veteran of the Venice Boardwalk outreach scene, Rabbi Mintz and as the Klezmer Concert approached (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/30/klezmer-on-the-beach-concert-was-a-great-success/">Klezmer on the Beach Concert Was a Great Success</a>) many, many friends, neighbors and my family. Over the course of the few hours we were there plenty of folks from the local area and as far as Australia, London, Israel (of course) and South Africa stopped by.<span id="more-2777"></span></p>
<p>Everyone was offered some apples and honey to symbolize our wish for a sweet new year and many obliged. We also gave tours of our shul and some even took advantage of the photo opportunity to take one with a rabbi (me). No doubt to show their parents back home &#8220;See I am hanging out with a rabbi in a shul!&#8221;. Of course we also invited them all to come again on the High Holidays if they needed a place to go and even to stop by on a Shabbos for a few moments any time they please.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will be there again this coming Sunday of Labor Day weekend to meet more people and dip even more apples into honey.</p>
<p>We look forward to more events open to the public and much more Outreach on the Beach.</p>

Yesterday we hosted a Klezmer concert on the Beach and it was a smashing success!</p>
<p>Dr. Ellie Goldstein&#8217;s close friend has been playing for Dr. Goldstein and his friends at Dr. Goldstein&#8217;s home for many years. Ron Grun (along with Ken Husbands) are very talented klezmer musicians and close friends of Dr. Goldstein.</p>
<p>Over the last year, PJC has been privileged to have Dr. Goldstein and his friends join our shul. One of the many perks of their involvement was the concert taking place in the shul.<span id="more-2773"></span></p>
<p>About 60-70 people attended the concert and many others stopped by for a quick listen and carried on their way along the boardwalk. We are so appreciative that Dr. Goldstein shared the concert with us and the entire beach community.</p>
<p>The concert was great. I confess to not being a Konnoisseur of Klezmer and I was very impressed. The music was great wonderful and the explanations that our performers provided were very interesting. I am so glad that so many folks were able to join us and stop by to get a taste of our shul and the friendliness of our community.</p>
<p>We look forward to more events like this in the future.</p>
<p>If case you missed it, here is a sample of the concert. (And next time be there!)</p>

<p>Google Maps has sattelite pictures of nearly the entire world. When you take pictures of everything, you&#8217;re going to catch some funny things.</p>
<p>Google has satelite pictures and &#8220;Street View&#8221; pictures which are (the ultimate stalking tool and) depict the view from the street. Most of the wacky Google Maps pictures are Street View pictures.</p>
<p>For a change, Gizmodo found a really cool satellite picture.</p>
<p>A crazy looking plane just above a residential street was spotted.</p>
<p>The street was Rose Avenue. The cross street was Lincoln Avenue. That is exactly where the Pacific Jewish Center Annex is located. <span id="more-2637"></span>Sure enough, the satellite photo of our annex has a crazy looking plane in the picture.</p>

It was Purim and they wanted to take pictures, talk with me and some of our Shul members and join in our Purim Celebration.</p>
<p>Never ones to turn down inviting strangers into the Shul, we welcomed them.</p>
<p>As I wrote at the time, our Purim Celebration was really special as we welcomed anyone and everyone off the boardwalk into our Shul. Read more here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/">Pacific Jewish Center Purim Celebration Recap February 28, 2010</a></p>
<p>Nancy took beautiful candid photos and David kind of blended in with the rest of us<span id="more-2382"></span> talking to us and learning about the Pacific Jewish Center and the festival of Purim.</p>
<p>Purim is a funny time to be introduced to new people. Things are a little different on Purim. But David managed to get to know us in a way that I never thought an outsider could.</p>
<p>Nancy and David produced a wonderful photo-film of their visit. It is part of their Escape Into America Series. The series is incredible. They have managed to find a lot of soul throughout their travels and it really comes through in their work.</p>
<p>In the photo-film about us, they did a really super job cutting through it all and finding the soul of our shul.</p>
<p>There are a couple things in the photo-film that are not perfectly precise, but that&#8217;s okay. (2 minor corrections: 1- I did mention to David that Purim costumes were likely borrowed for the Venice Carnival in the 15th Century and yet costumes fit in well with the themes of the day, 2- I am not sure I actually said that the Shul was in danger of disappearing &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t, rather, it could have been on that path).</p>
<p>Other than a couple minor mistakes the photo-film really captures the essence of Purim in our Shul as well as much of the essence of who we are at Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>The video stars everyone, but Yosef Beithalachmi (aka Mr. Pickles) and Ashi Bersin are featured in the voice-over. Great job!</p>

We are the custodians of the Shul on the Beach and any chance we have to share the Shul with the public we should!</p>
<p>This year we have had public events on <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-photos/" target="_blank">Chanukah</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/15/mishloach-manos-packing-on-the-beach-21410/" target="_blank">Pre-Purim</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/" target="_blank">Purim</a>. We also had several Sundays where we just hang out at the shul welcoming visitors.</p>
<p>Because Sunday was also an Erev Yom Tov (and people are making preparations for the holiday) we did not have a public event for Pesach (stay tuned &#8217;til Sukkos). But I felt it would be wrong not to open the shul doors for at least a little while so I went to the Shul for a couple hours on Sunday.<span id="more-2334"></span></p>
<p>My sister in law came over with Rami and Ozzie and kept and I on them while I gave out Matza and talked to anyone interested in hanging out for a few minutes. I met some very interesting people and took just a few photos which you can enjoy below.</p>
<p>It was a great compliment to a holiday that featured a lot of outreach as some community members hosted Seders for friends and neighbors. One seder had 58! guests and another had well over 30, while others hosted a smaller more intimate groups! I was very impressed with the commitment of those community members to sharing our wonderful traditions with those who may not be so familiar with Pesach and the seder. All I can say is <em>Thank You</em> and <em>Great Job</em>!</p>
<p>It was in this spirit that I took some time to meet and greet people at the Shul on the Beach. We look forward to more events open to the public and more Outreach on the Beach.</p>

<p>This Purim, The Shul On The Beach opened its doors to the entire Venice / Santa Monica community to join in a Purim Celebration. An excellent turnout from our members, friends and neighbors set the stage for a truly memorable afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Beithalachmi prepared a wonderful Purim feast that was partially sponsored by Yossi and Joannie Ziff on the occasion of their second anniversary. As always, Jeff Liss planned an excellent party, including first class entertainment (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/28/alula-performs-at-pacific-jewish-center-purim-party-in-venice/" target="_blank">see the previous post</a>), refreshments and a costume contest. Most importantly, our community really stepped up to the plate in terms of hospitality, friendliness and warmth. Led, once again, by Rabbi Mintz, many, many guests were ushered into the Shul.<span id="more-2185"></span></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting neighbors who had simply never dropped by the Shul, Israelis on vacation, random folks on Venice Boardwalk who wanted to stop in, children, elderly people, Jews, non-Jews, religious and otherwise. We tried to take photos with as many people as possible and you can check out the slideshow of photos below. [If you have any photos to add, PLEASE email them to me and I will add them!]
<p>Guests enjoyed hamentaschen, the lively music and touring our Shul. As always, we enjoyed meeting so many people from so many different backgrounds and situations and sharing the joy of Purim with them.</p>
<p>There was a small contingency from the press (MSNBC.com) that joined us throughout Purim. They were at the reading of the Scroll of Esther on Purim evening and returned for the today&#8217;s celebration. It was so much fun getting to know them and sharing our Purim with them. We look forward to seeing the fruits of their labor sometime in April. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
<p>The gathering was lively and inspiring. I spoke briefly about the meaning of our commandment to remember Amalek. Amalek attacked the Jewish people just after the Exodus from Egypt. They focused their attack on the stragglers. I expressed my hope that as a community we would not allow any stragglers. We must be inclusive and help everyone to feel that they are in the center of the group. There can be no fringe group if we are to &#8220;defeat&#8221; Amalek. Today&#8217;s event was a strong step in that direction.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to all of you who helped and joined and made the event the festive celebration it was.</p>
<p>We are planning more events of this nature in the future.</p>

<p><a href="http://frumsatire.net" target="_blank">Heshy Fried aka Frum Satire</a> performed in front of a very diverse crowd of ~60 at the Pacific Jewish Center at the Shul on the Beach on Sunday February 14 2010 and it was incredible.</p>
<p>Heshy ranted for over an hour and the audience was captivated. He could have gone on for another hour and had everyone laughing all the way through.</p>
<p>I introduced Heshy and the show with an important message.<span id="more-2155"></span> Judaism, in many ways has become more about idiosyncrasies and self-defining labels than substance, lately. Sometimes we need a keen satirist to remind us that most of that stuff is just silliness. We need to remember what the important things are and when Heshy cuts through &#8220;all the other stuff&#8221; with his wit and comedic genius, what remains is what is real.</p>
<p>So, I concluded, that is why I read Frum Satire and that is why I am honored to introduce all of you to the stylings of Frum Satire.</p>
<p>Heshy touched on so many great topics. Crazy shidduch resumes, messing with BTs, not looking yeshivish, kiddush techniques and many more hilarious anecdotes and observations were satired. The crowd loved it all. Laughing for an hour can hurt your face. I found that out after the show.</p>
<p>Heshy&#8217;s humor is clean and still manages to be very funny. Kudos!</p>
<p>Those who came to the show were so happy they did. Those who missed the show missed out on some great fun. We also met a bunch of new people to our shul who had never been inside before. It was a pleasure to meet you all!</p>
<p>I want to thank Heshy for making the Shul on the Beach his first West Coast show. We had a great time over Shabbos and the Sunday evening show. Come back and visit soon!</p>
<p>I edited a 7 minute portion of the show (just a few minutes from the beginning of the show) for your viewing pleasure. (I had no tripod and the camera was my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SER47Y?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001SER47Y">Canon PowerShot SD 780 IS</a> so please excuse the shakes.) Enjoy.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a great day for Pacific Jewish Center and our community.</p>
<p>A little while back, we decided that it would a lot of fun for the community to get together and pack mishloach manos together at the Shul on the Beach.</p>
<p>The event had a triple purpose. The goals were all met and exceeded. The first goal was to make a more creative mishloach manos that effectively reflected the spirit of the Shul on the Beach<span id="more-2149"></span> as opposed to using &#8220;canned&#8221; mimshloach manos from a vendor. The second goal was to have fun together as a community and use our creative talents in a productive way. The third was to invite the entire beach community to see our shul and invite them inside to see the shul and inform them about future events, like our upcoming Purim Celebration, as well as weekly services. This would be part of our Outreach on the Beach initiative.</p>
<p>Well, the mishloach manos are all packed. So we accomplished that goal.</p>
<p>A lot of community came to help and hang out and they all had a lot of fun. So we accomplished that goal.</p>
<p>And plenty of beach goers, dog walkers, tourists, neighbors and interesting people came to visit our shul and promised to return for a future event or services! Once again, we accomplished our goal. Some visitors even helped with the mishloach manos packing! Thanks!</p>
<p>It would be nice to mention everyone who came by name, but I know I would leave people out. So if you were there, maybe you&#8217;ll see a photo of yourself in the slideshow below. Leave a comment and tell us if you helped out!</p>
<p>The only person I will mention by name is my wife Tova. Tova organized the entire project and spent hours and hours choosing the items for the mishloach manos, finding the best vendors to purchase from, reordering when things got lost in transit or were out of stock 3 days before the event and of course designing the innovative looking mishloach manos packages. Thank you Tova!</p>
<p>Here is the slideshow. Enjoy!</p>

<p><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Words Are Cheap</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Vaera 2009</strong></p>
<p>This week’s Parsha is Vaera. The Parsha begins with a command from GD to Moshe. (Exodus 6:2) And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto him: &#8216;I am the LORD. And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name YHWH I made Me not known to them. And I have also upheld My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned</p>
<p>GD has a number of names by which we call him. What does it mean for GD to have various names? <span id="more-2027"></span>The way we understand this is that there are so many ways that Hashem relates to us. The way he relates to us at a particular time determines the name that we identify Him by. So if He is merciful we call Him Adon-y, if He is judging us He is know as Elokim and the Name. The verse is telling us that to the Patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) knew Hashem by His name of Sha-dai – and “my name of Hashem they did not know me by.”</p>
<p>Traditionally, this verse means that the Patriarchs did not know the merciful name of Hashem.  However, the Jewish people’s salvation from Egypt required the mercy of GD.  Thus, GD now informed Moshe that He would be adjusting His relationship with the Jewish people in order to bring them out of Egypt and into the land of Israel.</p>
<p>Rabbi Shimon Schwab attempts to explain our verse more simply. He is bothered by the word “V’Hakimosi” – “that I have upheld my commitment.” GD has not yet upheld any commitment other than delivering the Jewis into slavery! How can He say V’Hakimosi?</p>
<p>Rabbi Schwab says that this story is the same as another story. There was a very poor man who met a very benevolent fellow who wished to make his life easier. The rich fellow decided to give the poor fellow a million dollars. So what does he do? Does he give him 10,000 $100 bills? No he transfers the money to the poor fellow’s bank account. Now at this point we would say that the poor fellow is pretty wealthy now. But in truth has the money reached his hands? Has he actually touched or used his new money yet? No. But still we call him wealthy. Similarly when Hashem promised our forefathers that they would inherit the land of Canaan (eventually becomes the land of Israel) they considered it done! It was money in the bank. And even though they never saw the settling of the land themselves the promise was enough.</p>
<p>This is the idea of Sha-dai. For them it was dai, which means “enough.”  It was enough to have the promise and they did not need to actions for them to feel as if it was done. Therefore to the Patriarchs–V’Hakimosi is truth! To them it had already happened. To them the words were enough – Sha-dai.</p>
<p>The statement alone was enough for the Patriarchs to be able to live a transcendent existence and be one with GD. But the Jewish people were a massive nation now, far from the lofty levels of the Patriarchs. They needed a more tangible relationship to GD. They needed to see the results. They needed to see the promises of Hashem come to fruition. And thus, in this Torah portion  the process of the exodus began. The process of extricating the Jewish people from Egypt was now underway and the relationship with GD was more tangible to the Jewish people.</p>
<p>The Gemara in Avoda Zara (9a) says that the world is divided into three 2000-year periods. First there were 2000 years of darkness. This was until Abraham showed the world that there was a creator and taught the world about morality. The next 2000 years were the years of Torah. This was when we went to Egypt, were redeemed from Egypt and received the Torah. This was also the period of time that we lived the Torah to its fullest as the inhabitants of the land of Israel. The final 2000 years is the period of Mashiach. How can this be? The 2000 years is nearly complete and yet here we are with no Mashiach! That is not a very good result for a 2000 year period of Mashiach!</p>
<p>Rabbi Schwab uses the same principle as above to answer this as well. Out current exile mirrors the Egyptian exile. In Egypt the original relationship was a Sha-dai relationship with no action and just trust. That is how we are to relate to our situation as well. In our current exile we need to feel that trust. Eventually the redemption will come as a merciful act by GD and we will relate to that as the act of Hashem using his name of compassion. So these years of exile, of pain and suffering are still called the 2000 years of redemption.  Since it was promised to us by Hashem, it is as good as done. We have a track record with GD. He has delivered us from salvation in Egypt and we trust that He will save us again. Because GD’s words carry weight, they come with a track record.</p>
<p>For many of us, talk is cheap. We are skeptical and cynical. Today there is much talk of “change” and “hope” and while these are welcome sentiments we tend to be skeptical.  This is true for us as humans but we cannot get confused between the cheap talk of humans and the meaningful gifts and love that GD promises to us.</p>
<p>How can we as humans make our promises and ideas more meaningful? By attaching actions to our words we can make our words carry more weight. By doing more and saying less. Just as we expect GD to follow up his promises with action, we should follow up our own words with specific actions.</p>

<p>So, it is fair to say I have spent these last two Chanukahs in Santa Monica. Sure it&#8217;s different from Northeast. We never will have a &#8220;white Chanukah&#8221;. We had our Chanukah party on the beach with a moon-bounce outside. People are wearing shorts. It was 73 degrees today. It feels a little different, but we&#8217;re not complaining.</p>
<p>Turns out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer" target="_blank">Tom Lehrer</a> agrees with me. Chanukah is way better in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll tell you about it himself, just watch this&#8230;<span id="more-1935"></span></p>

<p>As the Shul on the Beach, a community institution, we are charged with the responsibility and opportunity to bring Judaism to the boardwalk. Our Chanukah party, the first in a series of events and programs designed to reach that end was incredible.</p>
<p>Thank yous are in order to Jeff Liss for organizing, planning and executing the whole thing. Thank you so much. Many others contributed as well and for that we express our appreciation to you as well.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing how many people came through our doors today,<span id="more-1866"></span>but it was a very large number. Rabbi Mintz was particularly effective at luring passers by into the shul. Thank you so much! The shul was packed with community members as well as many passers-by ranging from observant friends to completely unaffiliated Jews as well as many curious non-Jews.</p>
<p>I had the fortune of meeting some wonderful people. Like the father of an adorable daughter whose expectant wife was home. He thought a Chanukah Party would be the perfect way for this non-Jewish father to celebrate with his Jewish daughter. He noted, that as soon as possible, he will be bringing his wife and, God-willing, twin daughters, when mom and babies are up and about. He cited the generosity and friendliness of the community members as impressive.</p>
<p>I met people from all over Los Angeles. Locals, from Santa Monica and Venice. From all over Los Angeles from as far as the Valley to Marina del Rey. I met visitors from Chicago, New Jersey, Miami, Israel and the UK. It was truly a universal Chanukah celebration.</p>
<p>Once inside everyone was treated to warm hospitality, friendliness and traditional Chanukah foods. (Of course there was food.) Towards the end of the party I spoke to the remaining crowd and the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-address/" target="_blank">audio has been posted here</a>.</p>
<p>Our very talented Office Manager, Leslie Friedman took a lot of great photos. You can see them in a slideshow below. If you spot yourself leave us a comment and say hi!</p>

I hang out on the Venice Boardwalk hoping to meet anyone interested in our shul or Judaism. I show interested passers-by the shul, sometimes we take a picture, (I tell them about the blog), I invite them to &#8216;something&#8217;, we shmooze and then they are on their way.</p>
<p>This Sunday was the last Sunday before our upcoming Chanukah party so it was a prime opportunity to publicize the party which is open to the public.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <span id="more-1800"></span>the weather was not cooperative. It was cold by Los Angeles standards and the boardwalk was much quieter than usual. Very few people stopped in to say hi on this day.</p>
<p>But one encounter was just so remarkable that I wished to share it with you.</p>
<p>A pair of women were walking and as they passed the shul one of them veered in our direction and asked if she could come inside. She said the magical words that we hear all too ofter &#8220;I pass by the shul all the time, but it was never open&#8221;. &#8220;We&#8217;re working on that&#8221;, I respond with a smile.</p>
<p>One of the women is Jewish, mostly reform, but has been affiliated with Orthodox as well.</p>
<p>After a few pleasantries, I reveal that I am the Rabbi. I introduce myself as Eliyahu Fink. She asks if I am related to any other Rabbi Finks. I reply in the affirmative. My father is <a href="http://finkorswim.com/category/rabbi-aaron-fink/" target="_blank">Rabbi Fink</a>. My <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/rabbi-berel-fink/" target="_blank">grandfather</a> was Rabbi Fink as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your father Rabbi Aaron Fink?&#8221;, she asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes he is! Do you know him? And how?&#8221;</p>
<p>She tells me that she used to live in Buffalo NY where my father was Headmaster of the <a href="http://www.kadimah.org/index.php" target="_blank">Jewish Day School</a> for 4 years. She remembered me as a 6 year old boy and remembers my parents well. In fact she recently saw them at a wedding of a Buffalonian a couple years ago.</p>
<p>What a small world!</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will see her again at the Chanukah Party.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here is the picture I took with Linda in our Shul.</p>

<p>This week marks the first anniversary of the terrorist attack on the Chabad House in Mumbai, India. I dedicate this learning to the memory of the Holzberg, who were brutally murdered at that time.</p>
<p>This week’s Torah portion begins with the flight of Yaakov. He is a fugitive, having just snatched the primary blessings of Yitzchak from under his brother Eisav’s nose. Yaakov begins his exodus en route to the home of Lavan his mother’s brother to find his soul mate and marry her.</p>
<p>Does this storyline sound familiar? Did any other biblical characters leave their parent’s home recently?<span id="more-1731"></span> Of course we know that Avraham had just recently departed from Ur Kasdim and began his life in Eretz Yisrael. This week Yaakov begins his spirit walk from Eretz Yisrael to Charan.</p>
<p>There is one major difference however in the types of journeys that Avraham and Yaakov make. Avraham leaves with his entire family and entourage in tow. Avraham was a made man who just needed to make his life in a holier place. His life and family as a Jew were established – they just needed to move. Yaakov was running and he was running penniless, lonely and scared. This is a stark contrast to the Abrahamic journey. Rav Samson Raphael Hirsch points out this contrast to note that this is central to us as Jews.</p>
<p>Yaakov is also known as Yisrael and the only names for the Jewish people found in the Torah are the Bnei Yisrael and Beis Yaakov. We are named for Yaakov. The Jewish people are the children of Yisrael and the <em>House</em> of Yaakov. Today we read about the emergence of the <em>House </em>of Yaakov. Avraham traveled with his family and his home. Yaakov leaves with nothing and he travels to create and family and a home. He established the first Jewish home to bring the Shechina into that home through its existence. The home of Yaakov is a home where Hashem can rest His presence. And the journey to create that home begins in our Parsha. That journey has continued throughout the millennia as we ourselves embark on that same journey to build a home and bring the Shechina into that home.</p>
<p>On the night of Yaakov’s first stop he sleeps on the Temple Mount. Before resting his head he builds a rock formation to protect himself;’ this is the first home of Yaakov. During his slumber Yaakov experiences tremendous Divine revelations with eternal meaning. He witnesses angels ascending and descending a ladder. They are traveling from the Home of GD in the Heavens into the first home of Yaakov. Every Shabbos we greet angels into our home as well.</p>
<p>When Yaakov awakes he exclaims that this place is <em>Home</em> of God, a Beis Elokim. It is a place where God rests His Shechina. The Jewish home is a place where God rests His presence, and thus, is a place where we can find God.</p>
<p>Conversely, other cultures and religions preach going outside the home to “find”God. They look at nature, beauty, philosophy and they search for God. We always hear and know about people searching for God. We don’t hear too much about observant Jews “searching” for God. The observant Jew has no need to search. The message to the Jew is that God is out there but he is in fact much closer as well – he is right here in the home. God resides in the spiritual home and we create that environment for Him. This gives us tremendous power and an important opportunity that not to be missed!</p>
<p>Truthfully, our enemies knew this to be true as well. Later on in the Torah the gentile (pseudo) prophet Bilaam attempts to curse the Jewish people but is unable to do so. Despite his best efforts, he is only able to speak words of blessing.  One of the most poetic and moving sections of the entire Torah is where Bilaam exclaims “Ma Tovu Ohalecha Yaakov Mishkenosecha Yisrael,” “how excellent are your homes,” and he mentions Yaakov. Yaakov is the home and when we allow Hashem to enter we continue the journey that Yaakov began in our Parsha.</p>
<p>The most important asset to Jewish continuity is the Jewish home, which was established outside the land of Israel for the first time by Yaakov. Each one of us is maintaining that home every day. There are some people who raise the ante and are superstars in Jewish home building. Not only do those people establish a home for spirituality, they also share that home with everyone that comes their way.</p>
<p>This week is the anniversary of the terrorist attack on the Chabad House in Mumbai, India. The Holzbergs, previously of Mumbai, took home building to its most positive extreme. They were completely in a spiritual wilderness and managed to bring the Shechina to a spiritually dark corner of the earth. The Holzbergs were tremendous performers of Chesed. Rabbi Holzberg personally shechted chickens each week for all the Jews of Mumbai and for all its guests. Mrs. Holzberg baked 600 rolls per week to give the Jewish people of Mumbai and its visitors. That amount of chesed is a very strong prescription to bring the Shechina into one’s home. Working that diligently to bring Hashem into their home brought a light to their home and to India and to the world that is missed.</p>
<p>One observation I have is that this is the first time I know of that the Jewish home has been under attack. We have gone through attacks on buses, yeshivas, malls, airplanes etc. all in public places. This was the first time we were attacked in the Jewish home. To me this is something to think about. It could be the message here is that our homes are supposed to be immune to attack – but that is only when the spirituality of our collective homes is strong. Our homes have been under siege spiritually for some time now. The pitfalls of Western culture relationships and notions of love and child rearing enter our insulated homes and perhaps it has weakened us to the point where we are now vulnerable to physical attack. As long as our homes are fortresses of spirituality, we are protected but it could be that our homes have suffered from the unyielding onslaught of impurity that permeated our world, leaving us susceptible to attack.</p>
<p>In light of this view our response to terror is not – we must prevent this and raise awareness etc. or maybe if we had more political clout this would not happen or we need to fortify our homes with guns. Our response is purely to replace the missing spirituality from the world that results from their demise. We, as observers, are now charged with the task of replacing the lost chesed and the lost shechina through our own efforts. Incredibly, this is not that hard a task. What it requires from us is a commitment to the Jewish home. To reinforce those barriers that protect us from the spiritual holocaust that is our world. The commitment to continue Yaakov’s journey of building the Jewish home on our own by integrating Torah principles into our home gives the shechina its resting place in our world. The lesson of our Parsha and the lesson of lives lost is the eternal message that we don’t need to find GD – we just need to invite Him into our homes and He will find us.</p>
