				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let’s talk about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/17/inside-out-movie-review-and-analysis/">Inside Out</a> again. But this time we are not just going to talk in the superficial, “go see it” kind of way we did last time. Now it’s time for real talk.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Storytelling and Canvas Building</strong></span><br />
Movies can be diversions or just pure entertainment, but sometimes movies can be so much more. There are movies that illustrate grand important ideas in a new way that pushes culture and society forward. To me, this is the peak of storytelling. When the story itself is not really the thing the story is saying, because the thing the story is saying is so much bigger than the story, we experience a sort of storytelling magic.</p>
<p>Too often, fiction undermines reality. I’ll never forget this quip from Rabbi Tendler during a private study session. <em>“If you expect marriage to be the way marriage is portrayed in novels and films, you’re going to be waiting a long time for the violins.”</em> In context, he was teaching me that relationships take work and popular culture is not very good at real relationships. Generally, we watch saccharine caricatures of real life with simple resolutions, over-emphasis on raw feelings, and of course, violins.</p>
<p>I love when fiction does not try to rewrite reality. I love when fiction tells us something about reality. Done right, a movie can be a powerful storytelling device that helps us to understand and deal with reality. Fiction can be real.<span id="more-9321"></span></p>
<p><strong><u>A Movie of Biblical Proportions</u></strong><br />
Inside Out is not a very interesting story. There’s no villain, except maybe “the passing of time” and most of the story happens inside the head of an 11 year old girl named Riley. A lot of people seem to think that the movie is about the voices inside Riley. But the movie is not about the voices inside Riley’s head at all. They are just part of the canvas the real story of Inside Out is painting.</p>
<p>The brilliance of Inside Out is its lesson. Its mini lessons along the way are amazing. The way it teaches its lessons, using its internal metaphors and symbolism, is much more than brilliance, it is almost Biblical.</p>
<p>I think the primary lesson of Inside Out is profoundly simple. We have all been misled to believe that happiness is the cumulative feeling of avoiding pain, sadness, misery, and doubt. That is a lie. Happiness and joy are not the absence of bad experiences at all. In fact, without negative experiences, there is no joy. Children are not mature enough to understand this sophisticated point even if it is taught directly. Children deal with emotions and feelings in a very binary way. Things are either good or bad.</p>
<p>The real world is not like this at all.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/06/24/growing-up-what-religion-can-learn-from-the-magic-of-inside-out/insideout-640/" rel="attachment wp-att-9325"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9325" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/insideout-640.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="insideout-640" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Everything in our lives is a complex cocktail of contributory emotions. A little bit happy, a little bit sad, a little bit angry, a little bit worried, a little bit thrilled, and all at different levels. The first time we feel these complexities, it can be disconcerting. Adolescents are often brooding, moody, unpredictable, and sometimes their personalities are very different than they were as children. Part of that is the discomfort with encountering reality and perhaps even the real self. Inside Out is a parable that helps us understand the challenge of growing up from a child to an adult.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The New &#8216;A Separate Peace&#8217;</strong></span><br />
The fear and loathing of meeting one’s real self is the theme of one of my favorite books, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743253973/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0743253973&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=ZWOK3ZIBBJ3RR5JF">A Separate Peace</a>. It’s a mediocre story, but the story is not really the thing the story is saying. A Separate Peace is about adolescence, and facing one’s true self. That’s what it’s really about.</p>
<p>Inside Out is working on a different angle. The movie is helping us be honest with ourselves about what really makes us happy. Inside Out shows us that the best feelings and best emotions are a mixture of joy, anger, disgust, fear, and even sadness. In fact, Joy was only able to return to Riley because of Sadness. Acknowledging our sadness gives us the opportunity for happiness, not avoiding sadness. It wasn’t only Sadness, it was also letting go of childhood by saying goodbye to her imaginary childhood friend, Bing Bong. It’s counterintuitive at first, but just past the initial superficial level, lies this obvious truth. There is no happiness without sadness and there is no growing up without letting go of childhood.</p>
<p>These ideas are almost glibly demonstrated during Inside Out. But don’t let the simplicity of the way Inside Out teaches its lessons fool you into thinking these are not sophisticated and meaningful teachings.</p>
<p>Once Riley’s feelings are able to work together to craft more meaningful memories, their control panel console grows. Children only experience one feeling at a time and only one feeling can be in charge at any given moment. When we grow up, each feeling has a seat at the table and they all work together instead of jockeying for control. This is the primary lesson of Inside Out.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some Bonus Lessons</span></strong><br />
Along the way, Inside Out creates a magnificent storytelling device that gives the writers opportunities to teach so many more lessons that are tangential to the story. Inside Out sees our memories as sources of power for several islands in Riley’s brain. Each island represents a fundamental group of memories and experiences that Riley “visits” during nostalgic moments. The internal logic of the movie kicks Joy and Sadness out of Riley consciousness following a traumatic experience. Joy and Sadness find themselves marooned far away from headquarters. Their path back to headquarters is along the connection between headquarters and the islands. As Riley destroys her islands by poisoning her memories with rebellion, the path through Family Island remains Joy’s last hope. But when Riley kills Honesty Island, the paths to headquarters are all gone. I thought this was an incredible, subtle message about the importance of honesty. As long we are honest with others and ourself there is a path back.</p>
<p>Another amazing lesson was perhaps the most explicit moral of all. Bing Bong is feeling very sad and Joy tries every trick in the book to cheer him up. She is doing everything she can do to overpower Bing Bong’s sad feelings with her intense joy. It does not work. Sadness sits down next to Bing Bong and just listens to him tell her how he feels. Sadness tells him that she totally understands why he is sad and offers a hug and shoulder to cry on. That works. Joy is flabbergasted. Sadness explains that she saw he was sad so she just wanted him to know that she understands.</p>
<p>Later in the movie, Riley and her parents share a tender moment when they are honest with each other about how they feel. No one tries to fix their sadness or anxiety. They simply hear each other and enjoy a loving family hug.</p>
<p>Too often, we think the way to help a sad friend is to cheer them up. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/05/fixing-shiva/" target="_blank">But I think it’s always more helpful to just listen, understand, and offer a warm hug and shoulder to cry on</a>.</p>
<p>There are many additional teachings sprinkled though Inside Out. A few memorable moments stand out. My favorite might be when a box labeled “Opinions” and box labeled “Facts” spill over and the contents get mixed up. &#8220;Oh no!&#8221; exclaims Joy, &#8220;these facts and opinions look so similar!&#8221; &#8220;People are always getting these mixed up,&#8221; says Bing Bong. Indeed, they do.</p>
<p><strong><u>Who Cares?!</u></strong><br />
Why am I talking about Inside Out? Is there a point to all this?</p>
<p>Good question. Yes, there is a point to all this Inside Out talk. Two major points, in fact. One from the negative perspective and one from a positive perspective.</p>
<p>We are all Riley. Those of us are religious Rileys have an additional island of memories in our brain. Religious Riley has Religion Island. That’s where all our religious memories live. For most children, Religion Island should be pretty sweet. Kids love religion. It’s fun. The stories are interesting. The food is familiar. You spend more time with parents and family. Religion Island is awesome when you’re a kid. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">I think it&#8217;s important to actively create this sweetness for our families and communities</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Religious Trauma</span></strong><br />
Inside Out showed us how trauma shatters our childhood islands. When pain and sadness infect our religious nostalgia, we are destroying Religious Island. Some trauma is a direct result of religious experience and other trauma is unrelated to the religious experience. Any trauma can wreck Religion Island. This can happen even against our own wishes.</p>
<p>Religious leaders who seek to hide or inhibit public conversation about religious leaders who stumble or other flaws in their community, for fear of encouraging religious reprisal., or worse, are missing the point. It’s not the knowledge of bad behavior that harms people, it’s the trauma itself. Trauma severs the relationship between the person and the positive memories. Hearing about it does not do that at all. I think the Religious Island Destroyed by Trauma metaphor severely undermines the strategy of silencing criticism or victims of abuse.</p>
<p>More importantly, it explains why most of the people who leave their religious communities, don&#8217;t find comfort in a less strict religious community. Their religious island is gone. This new place is not the old place. The new place feels fraudulent and fake. <a href="http://zeek.forward.com/articles/117822/" target="_blank">The trust is gone</a>. But that does not mean it&#8217;s the end of the story.</p>
<p>There is also something incredible hopeful about the way Inside Out portrayed how Riley <em>rebuilt</em> her islands. True, the islands were completely useless following the trauma Riley experienced. But the movie shows us those islands restored and thriving even more than they were before they were broken. We also see added complexity to Riley’s islands and they are being powered by the new core memory cocktails of mixed feelings.</p>
<p>Often enough, people want to rebuild their dilapidated or broken religious islands. Somehow, Religion Island was destroyed for them at some point.  Eventually, they might want to reassemble their religious islands. But reconstruction is not possible using those old simple memories that are generally good. The cotton candy version of religion is gone for these people, but <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/11/11/rising-from-the-ashes-of-bad-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">building something new, with complexity, embracing ambiguity, and engaging in their struggles, is absolutely available</a>. It takes work, but it might be worth the effort.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consciousness and Construction</span></strong><br />
I think most conscious people have had their dreamlike childhood memories smashed. They might have felt real in the moment, but they are not reality. The real world is complex and confusing and contradictory. Real lasting relationships are built out of mixed core memory cocktails. Relationships between us and our spirituality, between us and our religion, between us and our community, our family, our spouse, our parents, our children, and ourselves, all can function, blissfully unaware, in rainbow, lollipop, and unicorn mode. In that mode, they are super fragile and they might collapse in a quick heap. But all our relationships function on a much higher level if we are conscious of the relationship and its complexity. They improve, when the parties to a relationship make the effort to build after something has been broken.</p>
<p>This secret to living is the soul of one important message in Inside Out. It&#8217;s applicable to religion, but it&#8217;s just as applicable to friendship, courtship, marriage, self awareness, and any other relationship. We start with only childish nostalgia. It might break one day and that will hurt, a lot. But moving past our childish nostalgia is not bad or evil, it&#8217;s just growing up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about time too. After all those years of hinting to us that we should try to just be a kid and stay young forever, Disney Pixar is telling us that it&#8217;s also time to grow up &#8211; from the inside, out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many Jews, Orthodox and non-Orthodox are left with a bitter taste in their mouths about the way Agudath Israel of America thinks about the non-Orthodox. In essence, their creed is something like &#8220;love the Jew, hate the Judaism.&#8221; It&#8217;s not precisely same as the &#8220;sins of sinners should be destroyed&#8221; of the Talmud. The modern version adds a few layers of contempt and derision above and beyond simply detesting the sin.</p>
<p>Although it should work intellectually, this kind of expression of love does not work for our hearts. We don&#8217;t appreciate it when people say &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but&#8230;&#8221; and we don&#8217;t like it when people say &#8220;I love you, but&#8230;&#8221; either. Whenever we temper statements that should be unequivocal, we make our statement less impactful. It can even completely undermine our starting premise when we qualify our emotional responses. &#8220;I love you, but&#8221; can sound a lot like &#8220;I don&#8217;t really love you.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://forward.com/articles/199363/why-love-the-jew-hate-the-judaism-is-so-wrong/" target="_blank">In the Forward</a>, Editor Jane Eisner engages this issue in a self-critical way.<span id="more-8458"></span> First she argues that in one sense, Rabbi Perlow is making a fair point. Secular Judaism may disappear because of intermarriage and assimilation. Just because it hurts to hear it, doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s not true. Further, Eisner claims that secular Jews make sweeping statements about Orthodox Jews that sound awfully similar to &#8220;love he Jew, hate the Judaism.&#8221; I admire Eisner&#8217;s candor and honest struggle with these issues. Seeing criticism in others is easier than seeing it in one&#8217;s own world. There are certainly similarities between the way both groups talk about each other.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Infinitylove-love-33175096-1920-1200.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8459" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Infinitylove-love-33175096-1920-1200.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Infinitylove-love-33175096-1920-1200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Of course there are differences too. The reason the Orthodox may hate the Judaism of the secular is almost always purely based on religious beliefs that may not be shared universally. The secular Jew who hates the Judaism of Orthodoxy may be coming from a place of liberalism and pluralism. They may feel that religious practices which are misogynistic or harmful to the emotional and physical wellbeing of other Jews are deserving of derision because of universal principles of fairness and humanism.</p>
<p>Either way, Eisner argues that non-Orthodox Jews must deal with the way they perceive the Orthodox Jew. Is it the same &#8220;love the Jew, hate the Judaism&#8221; as the Agudah? Indeed, it is close enough. Instead, Eisner suggests <em>&#8220;Love the Jew even if you don’t quite understand or endorse the Judaism.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I like it. But I don&#8217;t think it goes far enough.</p>
<p>In my community, whether on the beach or the Internet, I encounter this potential challenge on a regular basis. Here&#8217;s my approach: I just don&#8217;t bother with who is right and who is wrong. There is no moral judgment about another Jew&#8217;s Judaism. I do what I think is right and give others the same opportunity. If you do more or less or do it differently, it&#8217;s got nothing to do with my relationship to you as a person and as a fellow Jew. So my slogan is &#8220;I love you and what you do or think is irrelevant to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Loving another person has as much to do with their preferred flavor of ice cream , favorite sports teams, and brand of soap as it has to one&#8217;s religious observance. They have nothing to do with each other. Don&#8217;t put them in the same sentence.</p>
<p>In other words, as I&#8217;ve said in other contexts, &#8220;Don&#8217;t make your relationship with others dependent on the other&#8217;s level and style of religious observance.&#8221; We simply divorce the two, really unrelated, ideas completely. It&#8217;s more a &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; than &#8220;love the sinner, hate the sin.&#8221; This approach makes our relationships about people. Religious debate and discussion can happen in an environment of mutual respect and comfort. We don&#8217;t lob grenades over the fence. Religious discussion can only take place in a safe and non-threatening manner.</p>
<p>The only caveat is if you harm others in a physical or emotional manner under the guise of religion or secularism, the rules change. If someone is hurting people, then we may be obligated to become judgmental. But again, it&#8217;s not because of the religious practices or preferences that we object or criticize. It&#8217;s because of their behavior, irrespective of religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Shavuot is a holiday of national pride and unity. It&#8217;s the day we celebrate the covenant of Torah with the Master of the World. This was the day that our national mission began. That&#8217;s our national pride. But that covenant required us to feel connected to each other. Our rabbis teach us that we were of one heart.</p>
<p>One heart. Our hearts beat together. We express love for each other. Unity comes when we are able to connect our hearts together. Unity does not require that we be of one mind. That&#8217;s not even a factor.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s room for right and wrong opinions in Judaism. But our love for one another has nothing to do with our religious beliefs and opinions. That&#8217;s all in the mind. Unity is in the heart. In the heart there is no place for debate and argument. The heart is where we express our unbridled, unconditional, untempered love for our brothers and sisters. &#8220;I love you&#8221; without qualification and without compromise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the more perplexing Pesach customs is the public reading of Shir HaShirim (The Song of Songs). A variety of explanations are offered from every corner of our tradition. A new idea occurred to me over the holiday and I think it might be a useful perspective on the issue, but more importantly, I think there is a broader lesson that is worth sharing.<span id="more-8332"></span><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bigstock_In_love_Illustration__15364907.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-8333" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bigstock_In_love_Illustration__15364907.jpg?resize=491%2C321" alt="bigstock_In_love_Illustration__15364907" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Pesach celebrates a two step redemption from slavery to freedom. First there was the flight from Egypt. This was punctuated by the 10 plagues and a hasty escape. Almost immediately, a new challenge arose. The Reed Sea miraculously split and paved the way for complete salvation.</p>
<p>At that moment, we were free. For the first time in forever, we were completely free. It must have been exhilarating. The one thing every single person wanted more than anything else was freedom, and now they had it. Everything they yearned for was in their hands. The only struggle they had known was no longer a struggle. It was over.</p>
<p>Freedom is binary. Either one is a slave or one is free. There is no middle ground. It&#8217;s a simple on/off switch. The switch had been flipped.</p>
<p>A slave has a very limited capacity to worry about anything other than survival or freedom. A slaves concerns are immediate. Is there room for love? The arts? Philosophy? Personal growth? Not really. Life is very simple. It&#8217;s agonizingly simple. Survive and hope for freedom.</p>
<p>This was the life of the Israelites until this very moment. At present moment they were finally free. Now what?</p>
<p>Freedom is very different than slavery. One difference is that there is no switch. Life was no longer a binary struggle for the Israelites. From now on it would be a lifetime of tension and challenges. Slavery, for all its hardships, offers a cynical simplicity to life. Just survive the day and struggle for freedom. When the slave achieves freedom, there is no continuation of prior struggles. Everything begins anew and there is nothing from the past that illuminates the future.</p>
<p>The Israelites were free. They had no idea what they were supposed to do next. So they complained. A lot. But all their complaints were somewhat related. They had no idea how to be free, how to fend for themselves, how to ask for things nicely, how to carve out their own destiny. Hence, the <em>kvetching.</em> They saw a problem, they cried, and they expected their problems to be solved. They were looking for binary solutions to lifelong struggles. They needed food and water. They wanted a final solution to their thirst and hunger.</p>
<p>But real life is not like that. Reality is that hunger and thirst are lifetime struggles. There is no water lever or bread switch in the real world. In the real world, people work for their food. But this was not the life the Israelites knew. They had no idea how to live in a world of eternal struggles. Theirs had been been a world of on and off, and now they were in a brave new world that they were completely unequipped to handle.</p>
<p>Shir HaShirim is a love song. There is nothing more un-binary than love. No one ever says that they have enough love. No one ever asks for someone to love them less or to stop loving them. No one says they have enough love. We are in a permanent struggle with the people we love. We work so hard to give more love to our loved ones and we are in a constant state of receiving more and more love from others. Sometimes love is hard, sometimes love is easy, but love is a lifetime struggle. There is no love switch.</p>
<p>Love is the perfect metaphor for teaching a people about the struggles of life. A life of freedom is a life in constant struggle. This is what love teaches us. We read Shir HaShirim to remind us how to live and love as free people.</p>
<p>Freedom is exhilarating. But what do we do with freedom? We cannot be satisfied with freedom simply because it is an absence of slavery. To live just as a non-slave is hardly living at all. We are free. We can love. We have time to cultivate relationships with our families, significant others, friends, even God. But all those relationships are struggles. None are simple like the distinction between slavery and freedom. We went from <em>avdus l&#8217;cheirus</em>. It&#8217;s a transition that has clear lines of demarcation. One can go from being a slave to being free. But real life is not so simple. Real life invites lifetime struggles whose challenges give us a long path of never ending tension. That is what we learn from love.</p>
<p>The Israelites had freedom. Now they had to learn how to live the life of freedom. The life that has time for pursuits like the arts, philosophy, wisdom, discipline, and above all, love.</p>
<p>There is no song that tells the story of freedom like Shir HaShirim. Free people can love. Free people must love. Free people will struggle with love for their entire lives. That is freedom. The freedom to engage in life&#8217;s struggles that give life its beauty.</p>
<p>Identify your struggles. Seek out life&#8217;s challenges. Feel the tension. When you&#8217;ve done that, you know exactly where your life happens. It&#8217;s in those areas. Engage in it. Don&#8217;t look for the switch that turns those struggle off. Find the strength to live up to those challenges and live the life of freedom.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like so many of you, I was distraught over the last few days as we hoped and prayed that Caleb Jacoby be found safe and unharmed. Thankfully, Caleb was returned to his family unscathed, at least physically. It shouldn&#8217;t matter, but because of my personal relationship with Caleb&#8217;s father (I spent some time with Caleb too) and my very close friendship with Caleb&#8217;s aunt, I felt very connected to this saga. Learning that he was found brought me to tears, in public, and I was so relieved that the most difficult part of the ordeal seemed to be over.</p>
<p>The <strong>first</strong> thing I want to say is that every parent out there had to have been at their wits end concerned for Caleb&#8217;s wellbeing. We all love our children very much. But like so many things, we sometimes take our children for granted. We sometimes forget to give them the love that we want to give them. We sometimes are distracted when we are spending time with our children and we miss out on quality time together. That&#8217;s time we will never get back. But seeing Jeff and his wife Laura, in my mind&#8217;s eye frantic and nervous and scared that they might never see their beloved son ever again, reminded me to give my children a little more than I might have given them otherwise. Reminders like this are terrible but we might as well listen to our messages.<span id="more-8033"></span></p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t squander your opportunity to be a parent. As I wrote on Facebook when I heard the good news that Caleb was okay, hug your children a couple extra times today. Maybe tomorrow too. And the next day. When we empathize with others who are unable to do what we can do, it can motivate us to be more forthcoming in our efforts. Give your children some extra affection. Go for it. They deserve it. I am sure of it. Do it for all the parents out there who wish they could give their child a hug but they can&#8217;t because they are estranged, or the child tragically passed away, or their children are simply grown and it&#8217;s too late for gratuitous hugs.<a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lost-Found-Logo-Color-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8034" alt="Lost &amp; Found Logo Color 2" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lost-Found-Logo-Color-2.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Next</strong> I&#8217;d like to point out what has become standard operating procedure for this sort of ordeal can not in any way be sufficiently lauded. It&#8217;s truly remarkable that people who never met Caleb or his family were spending their time and energy searching for him. There are volunteers and do-gooders in all communities, but there is something special about the way we band together in times like these. It&#8217;s normal for local people and people with a special interest in something to pitch in and help out in any given situation or tragedy. What makes the Jewish community&#8217;s response so remarkable is that it transcends time and space.</p>
<p>Jewish people, and perhaps especially Orthodox Jews, who are from distant places will put their lives on hold to give a hand to their fellow Jew. People from completely different social and religious circles will participate in the efforts. There is something that unites all the Jewish people. It&#8217;s not just a cliché or a platitude. And it&#8217;s not only in times of tragedy or pain. We are quite literally a family and family puts everything on hold to help family. It was on display as this story unfolded just as it was so many times in years and decades past. Searching for Bais Yaakov girls in the woods, looking for Leiby Kletzky, converging on Sea Gate after Hurricane Sandy, and most recently as we tried to track down Caleb, our people have a way of pulling together and uniting to help one another. We loathe these opportunities, but we know how to rise up to the occasion. It&#8217;s impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, and this is the most important thing I have to say, let&#8217;s be careful about what we say in the coming days and weeks about this incident. It was quite dramatic and we saw an outpouring of willing volunteers. That made the story quite public. But at this point, the public part of the tale has come to a close. The rest of the story is private.</p>
<p>After suffering through a few days of agony, let&#8217;s not spoil the euphoric reunion with innuendo and speculation. More than a few people have offered their armchair psychological analysis and others have demanded a full report to the public. One person even asked me if the public has a right to hear the story because they prayed and volunteered their time in the search. I find this abhorrent. It&#8217;s not just nosy, it&#8217;s disrespectful. And I think it&#8217;s a symptom of a very base desire. One that we ought to reign in as best we can.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret. We love gossip. We love juicy details and nuggets of inside information. My father used to say that the idol of the late 20th century was the Fox, as in 20th Century Fox. We loved television and movies. But now we love gossip even more. Our idols are Perez Hilton and TMZ. We just need to know. And when we don&#8217;t know, we just throw out wild guesses. People might try to disguise their curiosity in moral terms or altruistic intentions. But really, it&#8217;s just plain gossip.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty much always wrong. Judaism famously places great importance on privacy. But I think this is a unique scenario that requires even more sensitivity than usual. Here we are dealing with a child. Yes, sixteen years old is still a child. And when we are dealing with children we cannot drag them into the public eye. It was an emergency situation that called us to action. But once the emergency is over, our license for information is rescinded. Not only are we dealing with a child, but we are dealing with a father who is very much in the public sphere. Not only that, but this sort of incident lends itself to speculation because so much is almost certainly going to be left unsaid.</p>
<p>Please give the family the space that they need to heal from this ordeal. Do not speculate. Do not make accusations. Do not make demands for information. Just wish the family well and go back to your lives.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of the Internet age is defining boundaries. People share more of their lives with more people than ever before. It could be great. It could be fun. It could be meaningful. It could be a blessing. But don&#8217;t confuse voluntary sharing of information with gossip and telling tales.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been quite the roller coaster week in the Orthodox Jewish community. Some things have divided us. Other things have united us. Let&#8217;s always remember that even when we disagree, we are brothers and sisters who, when all is said and done, go back to the same home and love each other despite any differences we may have. It&#8217;s not lost on me that immediately following an event that generated vitriolic and hysterical (not the funny kind of hysterical) opinions between Jews, we&#8217;ve come together with the Jacoby family.</p>
<p>Of all the Torah portions, Beshalach is the most intense roller coaster ride of a parsha. We escape Egypt to safety, the Egyptians pursue us and we are trapped by the sea, the sea opens for us and we march forward, the Egyptians follow us and we can only assume they will catch us, the water crashes behind us and drowns the Egyptians thereby saving us, we sing a song of thanks, then we are thirsty, we are given water, then we are hungry, we are fed, then we want meat, we are given meat, we are given the gift of Shabbos, it is violated immediately, we were thirsty again, God gives Moses a secret well, Moses sins and is punished, then we are attacked by Amalek in a microcosm of the entire sedra, we can&#8217;t seem to stave them off, Moses lifts his hands and we start to win, then Moses gets tired and we start to lose, Joshua and Chur support Moses so he can lift his hands and we are able to defeat Amalek. Safety and danger. Safety and danger. Safety and danger. Safety and danger. Safety and danger. Time and again. Beshalach is a roller coaster ride and this week was also a roller coaster ride.</p>
<p>The Beshalach coaster ends positively and portends the revelation at Sinai. A good ending to a frenetic story. Let us hope and pray that we learn and grow from the peaks and valleys of the parsha and our communal life. Even more, let us be forge ahead to a new week and anticipate better tidings in the coming days and weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am reluctant to write a post just to respond to a random &#8220;heartfelt plea&#8221; that was circulating on the Internet yesterday. In the letter, a single woman asks her friends for more understanding and in a series of contradictory instructions dispensed advice for her friends. I won&#8217;t respond to her letter. It&#8217;s too raw and too much emotion for a fair response.</p>
<p>In truth, the substance of the letter is irrelevant. Clearly the woman is in a lot of pain. She admits that she is basically &#8220;losing it&#8221; and it&#8217;s difficult to read the letter and not feel her suffering.</p>
<p>I have two things to say.<span id="more-7445"></span></p>
<p>The letter indicates that she desperately wants children. She doesn&#8217;t seem to care very much for a husband. According to my research this is not an uncommon sentiment. Young women who are looking to get married seem to be more focused on babies than men.</p>
<p>It could be argued that cohabitation with a male mate is just a mechanism for procreation and anything more is an unnecessary distraction. Modern people don&#8217;t think like that anymore. We view marriage as an opportunity for love. Finding a life partner has become a very important part of our culture. It didn&#8217;t happen in a vacuum either. Chazal already taught us that there must be attraction between husband and wife. It would seem like something worth looking forward to.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7446" alt="6a00d83452b15969e201910440d838970c-800wi" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/6a00d83452b15969e201910440d838970c-800wi.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>So why doesn&#8217;t she feel the need to find a husband? Two reasons jump out at me and both of these reasons speak to broad social issues.</p>
<p>She is reacting to what her friends are doing and talking about. Her friends talk about their kids. Her friends apparently don&#8217;t talk about their husbands. This is normal in the frum community. It&#8217;s not socially acceptable to talk about one&#8217;s spouse to others in any familiar way. If a spouse is mentioned, it&#8217;s very sterile and certainly not intimate. This is a function of tznius standards. It&#8217;s not bad per se but we can see a possible negative consequence of this strict silence on husbands and wives. It could be that single people don&#8217;t even realize that there is any beauty in a loving spousal relationship. They don&#8217;t hear about it from their friends and sometimes it can be hard to see it in one&#8217;s parents. Perhaps it would be wise to emphasize this aspect of marriage a bit more in our communities.</p>
<p>The second reason I think she may not be looking for a husband is because of the general approach toward men in the frum community. Women (and even men) are taught that men are basically animals. Women are taught (incorrectly) that they must dress modesty so that men do not sin. Men are told not to look at women because it will cause them to sin. Is it any wonder that young women are not looking forward to a relationship with one of these beasts? The discourse must change. We cannot talk about men in this way and we cannot teach tznius in a way that reinforces this negative portrayal. Maybe young women will actually want to get married for the sake of being in a relationship with a life partner.</p>
<p>The second point I want to make is that it should not be debilitating to be single. The frum community values marriage so greatly that it seems impossible to be a happy, well-adjusted, successful single woman. By broadcasting the importance of marriage, and it is important, we may also be projecting negativity toward single women. I think it would be good for our community to find a way to create a safe and productive place for single women. We should not be defining ourselves purely by marital and child bearing status. There is so much that needs to be done in our world. Single women can do so much. Minimizing them into potential baby makers is dehumanizing and we can see how it feels to be left out of the baby making party.</p>
<p>I feel for this woman. I really do. But I think we didn&#8217;t prepare her for this and we should be doing better for our singles. Being single is not a disease. It may not be ideal but it can be a great time in one&#8217;s life and great things can be accomplished. We need to figure out a way to make this happen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/torah_study.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7237" alt="torah_study" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/torah_study.jpg?resize=300%2C223" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>“Concerning this it is told in the account of the Wars of the Lord, &#8220;What He gave at the [Sea of] Reeds and the streams of Arnon.” &#8211; Numbers 21:14</i></p>
<p>The Torah connects the miracles at the Sea of Reeds with the miracles at the streams of Arnon. We are very familiar with the splitting of the sea and the drowning of the Egyptians as the waves crashed down upon them. At the streams of Arnon, Amonites and Moabites were waiting for the Israelites and planned to ambush them. G-D saved the Israelites by crushing the soldiers lying in wait with the mountains they were using for cover. The twin peaks merged together destroying the people lying in wait. The verse tell us that these fantastic miracles are recorded in the book of the Wars of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Hebrew words for “what He gave at [the Sea of] Reeds” are “et vahev b’Sufa.” In the Talmud, our Sages ask what <i>drasha </i>we can learn from the words in Psalms (127) “et oyvim b’shaar &#8211; the enemies at the gates?” The Talmud answers in name of R’ Chiya bar Abba that even a father and son or a teacher and student that study Torah in one gateway become enemies when they argue about the Torah and they do not budge from their position until they love one another, as the verse says “et vahev b’Sufa.” Rashi explains that the Talmud is referencing the mention of the book of the Wars of the Lord and is playing on the word vahev which is similar to the word ahava &#8211; love, and is saying that the battles of Torah (the Wars of the Lord) end in love.</p>
<p>R’ Schwab asks the obvious question here. This is a very farfetched <i>drasha.</i> What possible connection could there be between the splitting of the seas, the crushing of potential ambushers by way of mountains, and the intense study of Torah with a partner?<span id="more-7236"></span></p>
<p>We can understand the teaching of the Talmud if we examine the true nature of the miracles being referenced here. There were several miracles at the Sea of Reeds, but the miracle recognized here is the demise of the Egyptians in the raging waters of the sea. The waters split for the sake of the Israelites. It was a necessary measure to save the Israelites from certain death. Once the danger passed there was no longer a need for the miracle and the miraculous forces that were keeping a dry path in the sea stopped holding the waters back. As soon as there was no force splitting the sea, the waters returned to their natural, original position and the Egyptians drowned in the crashing waters.</p>
<p>Similarly, the miracle at Nachal Arnon was the merging of two mountains to crush the enemy. In essence, says R’ Schwab, the two mountains were really one mountain with two peaks. They were supposed to be one mountain but were only two peaks for the sake of giving a path for the Israelites to pass. To crush the would-be ambush all that was required was a suspension of the miracles separating the two peaks. Once the force keeping the mountain in two parts stopped, the mountain naturally crushed the ambush.</p>
<p>When fathers and sons or teachers and students study Torah they become enemies. They take different positions on matters of great importance. They disagree on the correct understanding, message, or interpretation. They argue for their point of view and fight for their position. It looks like there is a legitimate war. But the truth is that this schism is a mirage. Their true status is a state of peace and love. It’s just that through arguing in the Battles of Torah they take positions that are at odds. Love is their natural position.</p>
<p>The Talmud is saying that the same way the waves crashing on the Egyptians and the mountains crushing the ambushers was the previously held unnatural state returning to its natural state, “et vahev b’Sufa” can refer to the natural state of love between opponents in the Battles of the Torah. Even though they appear to be at odds, they are really only temporarily arguing. Their true state is peace, love, and harmony. The <i>drasha </i>is not so farfetched after all.</p>
<p>Never in the history of the Jewish people have so many people had the opportunity to hear so many different perspectives and ideas about Judaism. Hundreds and thousands of years ago, people were exposed only to the small group of people they knew personally. Eventually, books were published with slight variances of tradition and thought but generally speaking, people knew what they knew and they did what they did. Our modern society has opened the floodgates of information. This is a great blessing. We have access to more Torah than we ever had before. But we must now contend with many more competing views of religion in general, Judaism, and Orthodox Judaism. As a group we have a lot of opinions and we are passionate about our ideas.</p>
<p>Sometimes the discussions and disagreements can get heated. After all, it is the Battle of the Torah otherwise known as the Wars of the Lord! There is so much at stake and there is so much to learn and to discuss. We all have opportunities to hear new ideas and learn from others. We also have a chance to share our perspectives and opinions. This is wonderful. But we cannot forget that despite our differences, they are only superficial. Disagreement is not our natural state. Our arguments are only for the sake of Torah and G-D. We must be sure that when our arguments end we find ourselves in our natural state of peace, love, and harmony.</p>
<p>What a poignant thought for our generation. In a world of international discussion and debate via the Internet we can never forget that when our learning is over we leave the conversation with the love of a father to a son. Certainly, in our face to face interactions, Shabbos table discussions, coffee room shmoozing, and of course learning in the Beis Medrash we always remember that it ends in our natural state of love and affection toward each other. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6650" alt="ap_newtown_sandy_hook_school_Sign_balloons_thg_121215_wg" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ap_newtown_sandy_hook_school_Sign_balloons_thg_121215_wg.jpg?resize=300%2C168" data-recalc-dims="1" />There are no words to properly describe the horror of last friday&#8217;s shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. I was a wreck the entire Friday. My job requires me to be strong and put on a good face over Shabbos. I did the best I could. My sermon was heavily influenced by my feelings about the tragedy. After Shabbos and on Sunday and Monday, it was still too hard to get through full sentences when reading or talking about the tragedy. It was impossible to watch the news.</p>
<p>I did talk a little about the tragedy on Facebook and tried to facilitate some discussion. But it was too hard to write about it in this space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still hard, but less so at this point. That&#8217;s the blessing of our ability to forget. But it&#8217;s also a curse to be able forget if we don&#8217;t do what we can to prevent future tragedy.</p>
<p>I have a few things to say on the tragedy and they are not really related. So please excuse the unrelated points in this post.<span id="more-6649"></span></p>
<p><strong>I. Children</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to read about parents losing their children in this senseless shooting and not be so thankful every day that our children (or your brothers and sisters, or your nieces and nephews) are safe. It makes us pause and reflect on how precious our children are to us. It makes us want to shower our children with love and keep them safe and happy. It makes us forget any <em>tzaar gidul banim </em>that we may have felt. All we want to do is reassure our children that they will be okay and that we will always be there for them. People mean it when they say &#8220;hug your children a little more&#8221; after a tragedy like this. I know I did.</p>
<p><strong>II. Mental Health</strong></p>
<p>We need better mental health awareness and care in this country. This area of medicine is always evolving and what we know now is so much more than what we knew years ago. We can do more than ever for people who need help. But unfortunately, there is a very negative stigma attached to those who need mental health care. We push people away from it as long as possible to avoid the stigma and then it can sometimes be too late to make a real difference. So while more care is important, it is even more important that those who need and receive care are not stigmatized.</p>
<p>A few hundred years ago we would have said that these people were possessed by the devil or a dybbuk. Now we know better. But we need to act differently and not see them as horrible people, rather they are people with challenges just like everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>III. Empathy</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge America faces as a society is that we do not share a common ancestry or ethnicity. It is also a huge blessing and makes America a beautiful melting pot. But because we are not as connected as people in other nations our sense of community suffers. People feel isolated. We live very manufactured lives. Most of us are not involved in the process of producing stuff, we just consume stuff. We are detached from our communities and neighbors. This has several harmful effects.</p>
<p>First, it means that if the neighbor&#8217;s kid is acting strange or we think he needs help, we don&#8217;t say anything. It&#8217;s not our business, we say. We are not comfortable poking into other people&#8217;s lives. Privacy is great and I think people should mind their own business. The problem is that &#8220;their own business&#8221; is so narrow that it only includes a very small number of people. I think it&#8217;s healthy when people are able to have relationships with others that change their business into your own business. If you think about it, my brother&#8217;s business is my business. That&#8217;s because we care about each other. We love each other. What he does matters to me. But I don&#8217;t feel that way about my neighbor. Certainly, some bounderies are necessary for a functioning society, but I think we need to care about each other more. When we think someone needs help, we need to have the courage to say something and we also need to have the courage to hear it and not lash out against those trying to help.</p>
<p>Second, it means that someone can get to the point that they are so isolated that they can shoot children and not care. A person who feels empathy and connects with others in their community does not kill people in that community. This is a general solution that could solve so much of our crime. People don&#8217;t harm people that they care about. We need to expand the group of people of whom we care about.</p>
<p>We need to figure out why mass shootings are a uniquely American phenomena. I think this might be part of the reason. Judaism very strongly promotes creating this kind of empathetic society. We need to do a better job amongst ourselves to play our role as a light unto the nations.</p>
<p><strong>IV. Guns</strong></p>
<p>I am<b> </b>not going to discuss arguments for or against increased gun control laws. It&#8217;s a very, very, very complicated issue and neither side of the debate has a viable solution.</p>
<p>However, I have a different observation. Let&#8217;s assume that increased or decreased gun control laws won&#8217;t significantly affect future mass shootings. There is still an argument to be made that some people don&#8217;t want to &#8220;live in a place that embraces / bans guns&#8221;. In other words, sometimes the law is not what makes the difference, it&#8217;s the principle of the law. Pro-gun people will say &#8220;I want to live in a place where citizens can have guns and have the right to defend themselves against violent crime&#8221;. Anti-gun people will say &#8220;I want to live in a place where gun ownership is taboo&#8221;.</p>
<p>But I think this argument is flawed. We should all want to live in a place where all kinds of people want to live. Isolating some or many of them is selfish. One will hear similar arguments about gay marriage. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if people are gay. I just don&#8217;t want to live in a place that being gay is considered normal and a law that recognizes gay marriage does just that&#8221;. This argument is also abhorrent. We should all want to live in a place that gives every non-criminal or non-danger to society a comfortable place to exist. I feel the same way about this genre of argument regarding guns.</p>
<p>The only thing that I will say about the gun debate in our country is that it has become a very partisan issue and that precludes meaningful discussion. I don&#8217;t think there is any one event that would sway an ardent gun advocate to the other side of the debate, lest they change ideology and vice versa. More mass shootings turn into arguments for more guns and just as passionately against guns.</p>
<p>I will just say that owning a gun is a serious halachic issue, particularly if one has children in the home and must be discussed with a halachic authority or independently researched.</p>
<p><strong>V. Theodicy</strong></p>
<p>People will ask: How does God allow senseless murders? Why do tragedies like this happen?</p>
<p>There is only answer that is acceptable. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Any moron who says anything other than &#8220;we don&#8217;t know&#8221; needs to be stopped. Please.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/divorce.gif"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5243" title="divorce" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/divorce.gif?resize=269%2C269" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A lot of people seem to agree that the chasidic system (maybe even the charedi system as well) of marriage and dating needs some updating. There is also a consensus that using religion as a weapon to keep people in the fold is wrong. Most people also think that mothers should have custody of their children even if they are not religious and the father is religious.</p>
<p>Is there any hope that the charedi and chasidic worlds can adapt and adjust to fix these problems?</p>
<p>From what I am hearing, the answer is yes. Several commenters on the blog and Facebook have shared encouraging developments. It seems they are open to new ideas. In this spirit, allow me to make a few suggestions. Keep in mind, these are suggestions for insular communities. I prefer non-insular communities in general. But in the meantime, here is some advice that can be implemented within the insular communities.<span id="more-5242"></span></p>
<p>First, some definitions:</p>
<p>Chasidic community: A<em>n insular community where the entire community is expected to conform to one way of religious life.</em></p>
<p>Chasidic dating: <em>Parents arrange meeting between two 17-18 year olds. They meet for 30 minutes. They decline or agree to see each other again. The second date seals the deal.</em></p>
<p>Charedi community: A<em> non-chasidic community that tries to reduce engagement with the outside world and prefers a lifestyle of exclusive Torah study over a career.</em></p>
<p>Charedi dating: <em>Parents arrange a meeting between a preferably 18-19 year old girl and a 22-23 year old boy. They meet for 3-4 hours between 4-8 times. They get engaged and see each other a few times before the wedding 2 months later.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dating</strong></p>
<p>No one under the age of 19 should be considered for a shidduch. They are off limits. Couples should date for no fewer than 1 month and see each other a minimum of 10 times before getting engaged. Dates should be fun, encourage conversation, the conversations should include things like how excited one is about religion and if there are things that they question.</p>
<p>Engagements should last 3 months. The couple should see each other no less than once every two weeks. When they see one another they should have fun and enjoy each other&#8217;s company. They should have at least a preliminary conversation about intimacy before the wedding night. The teachers who will explain to them how &#8220;things work&#8221; should be extremely highly qualified and be as liberal as the community allows.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
<p>Couples should be advised on matters of family planning. This is not the place to go to far into detail. But if the children of the couple will be a burden on the community, they might need to ask a shyla before having children, not vice versa. Further, when a couple has children too quickly, it can stunt the development of their relationship which is barely in its infancy after a contracted dating period and quick marriage.</p>
<p><strong>When Things Go Wrong</strong></p>
<p>During a marriage, one spouse may prefer a more or less religious lifestyle. This should not be immediate grounds for divorce. The goal should be happiness for the couple and keeping the family together. Men should not be defined by the way their wives act and women should not be defined by the way their husbands act. Religious compatibility does not need to be the deciding factor in marriage. I know couples who are very happy and they each observe to different degrees. This should be acceptable.</p>
<p>If the couple is incompatible religiously and incompatible in general a divorce should be sought. The get should not be withheld at all. The couple should strive for a custody agreement that is mutually agreeable. If they cannot agree, the secular courts should decide it. A Beis Din is not the place to decide custody matters when one parent is more religious than the other. It is inherently unfair. The couple better try their best to agree because the courts may decide to create a system that neither party likes.</p>
<p>These are some of my thoughts and ideas. I don&#8217;t imagine that they will solve all the problems. Nor do I imagine that any system is perfect. But I do believe that not tweaking the system will cause it to collapse. Albert Einstein said: <em>&#8220;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We want different results. We want better results. Perhaps these suggestions can help just a bit.</p>
<p>I am open to any ideas you have. Remember we are trying to maintain the basic standards of the chasidic and charedi communities. Major overhauls are a non-starter.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I am a lesbian marrying a gay man. We are out to each other and our closest friends. We both grew up in religious, traditional communities so we decided this was best for us. We both travel a lot so we are able to &#8220;explore&#8221; outside of the marriage. Ask away&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>Edit: we are doing this to stay connected to our community and our traditional (Orthodox Jewish) families.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Edit: to be clear, we are both seeing other people outside our relationship. We are out to close friends. I came out to my parents a while ago so technically they know but think that I have &#8220;changed&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>There are over 1100 comments on the post as I type these words. They are worth seeing.</p>
<p>This couple&#8217;s story is not as unique as one might think. In the summer there was an article in Time Magazine about a rabbi who arranged similar marriages between homosexual members of the opposite gender.<span id="more-4750"></span></p>
<p>Gay activists have been known to find this kind of arrangement backward, regressive and bigoted. They argue that gay people should be able to marry other gay people. And why stay in a community that shuns your sexuality?</p>
<p>Orthodox Jews have also been known to find this arrangement objectionable as well. The common orthodox Jewish objection is usually formulated along the lines of &#8220;they should just not be gay&#8221; or something like that.</p>
<p>I think both arguments are flawed. There is something important that can be learned from these arrangements. It speaks to the fundamental difference between the secular view of marriage and the orthodox Jewish view of marriage.</p>
<p>The secular view of marriage is mostly about love and intimacy. When the love one has for one&#8217;s significant other rises to the level that warrants commitment, marriage is the logical choice. Viewed in this light, without love what is the point of marriage. Marriage is a validation of the relationship. And if the relationship is missing love and intimacy then there is little point to the union.</p>
<p>In the end, many secular marriages end up being loveless and without intimacy. Some survive for the sake of kids or because divorce is taboo. But they have little utility when the spark is gone. So divorce is a wise, if not the only choice.</p>
<p>In general, this speaks to an overall secular attitude that places intimacy and love above nearly all other values. After all, all you need is love.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in orthodox Judaism, marriage is about much more than love and intimacy. It could even be argued that love and intimacy are of the least important aspects to a marriage. Arranged marriages, short dating periods and short engagements result in many wonderful marriages. Marriage is about raising a family, being part of a community, creating an environment that promotes personal growth and healthy self-sacrifice. Part of all that includes intimacy and love. A good loving environment will help further greater goals.</p>
<p>But in the absence of love and intimacy there can still be monumental value in marriage. Even without love and intimacy, as long as there is no strife or abuse, there could be real valuable reasons to stay in the marriage. Divorce can be a reasonable choice. But I don&#8217;t think it is the only reasonable choice.</p>
<p>In light of this, raising a traditional family, staying in one&#8217;s community with one&#8217;s family and forgoing the supposed love and intimacy of marriage could be a reasonable choice in an orthodox Jewish environment.</p>
<p>I am not saying that I condone these marriages and arrangements nor do I think that I would recommend them. But I do think that these arrangements indicate something lofty about the goals and ideals of marriage in the orthodox Jewish world. It is much more than love and intimacy and in fact, it could work without those things. It could work very well.</p>
<p>And for the sake of these daring trailblazers I hope it does.</p>

(It all went down during my blogcation  <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/25/things-i-would-have-blogged-about-in-the-last-ten-days-if-i-were-a-real-blogger/" target="_blank">Things I Would Have Blogged About in the Last Ten Days If I Were a Real Blogger</a>) but didn&#8217;t include in that post because I thought I was going to blog about it anyway. I didn&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>Chua&#8217;s book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594202842/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1594202842">Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</a>) is all about pushing your children to the limit. Expecting the most from them and demanding excellence in everything that they do. Allegedly. I have not read it. But I did read about 25 articles talking about the book.</p>
<p>To me it all sounding very similar to [stereotypical] Jewish parenting techniques as well. Push your children, guilt them if they don&#8217;t perform, give them every opportunity to find their special talent, put trophies on the mantel, etc. In fact, Chua is married to a Jewish man.</p>
<p>My thoughts at the time of the book&#8217;s release and articles were complicated, but the overall feeling I had was that there was not enough unconditional love in her parenting. Children need love as much as they need discipline. The world can be a tough place. Children depend on their parents for the confidence to thrive and knowing they are loved is an indispensable tool toward success. It seemed Chua&#8217;s parenting placed a premium on everything but unconditional love.</p>
<p>Now, a passionate, heartfelt, moving op-ed in the NY Times provides some perspective.<span id="more-4715"></span></p>
<p>A mother of a baby with Tay-Sachs disease writes about parenting a child who will not live past the age of three. Of particular interest to Jewish families because the child has Tay-Sachs, a disease that has very high frequency in the Ahskenazik Jewish community that has been mostly quashed by screening, this mother is Irish and the screening that she went through for diseases including Tay-Sachs came back negative.</p>
<p>So she is parenting a baby who will not take music lessons, karate, play soccer, apply to college or do anything remarkable that a Tiger Mom would hang on her Wall of Fame. And the contrast is stark.</p>
<p>It is all love, no discipline, no competition and no Mommy and Me. I think we all can learn from this Dragon Mom and not forget that as much as we want our children to excel, they want our love.</p>
<p>Read the article. I expect it will make you cry. It did for me.</p>

<p>American Idol Season ~46,281 is underway and the most memorable moment so far has certainly been the Pants on the Ground phenomena. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY8uzqNi4sA" target="_blank">If you have seen or heard of it &#8211; you MUST go here right now and watch it (come back quick).</a></p>
<p>But as funny and entertaining as Larry Platt was, a different contestant said something that really struck a cord within me. That contestant was Lloyd Thomas.<span id="more-2091"></span></p>
<p>It must take a certain level of confidence and narcisism to audition for American Idol. You need to promote yourself and sing in front of famous people as well as hope for a chance to sing in front of thousands more. That is not to mention the millions watching at home on TV and then reviewing it all on YouTube the next day!</p>
<p>And it stand to reason that most contestants that make it through to the next round are appreciative of the opportunity. Yet, most often they talk about how well they are going to do in the next round and try and endear themselves to the audience in case they make it really far.</p>
<p>Lloyd Thomas said something completely different. Watch the video below for the full quote. But in short, he made it through to the next round and said one of the sweetest things I have ever heard.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I wish you could all taste what I taste right now&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>In his moment of triumph, in his moment of victory he was thinking about others. In the moment that most people would use for self promotion, he used it for sharing his love for people.</p>
<p>It certainly gave me pause.  When we are successful do we think to ourselves &#8211; I hope everyone else can feel this feeling of success? It certainly is not intuitive. But I must thank Lloyd Thomas for teaching me how to enjoy success.</p>
<p>Thanks Lloyd. And good luck!</p>
<p>You made a fan out of me&#8230;</p>

<p>A few days ago a photo was posted on <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">Twitter</a> by the <a href="http://twitter.com/NBA" target="_blank">NBA</a>. Somehow, this photo has been on my mind since I saw it.</p>
<p>In sports, two teams oppose each other under the pretense that they are enemies. Their fans may even dislike one another, (see Celtics / Lakers, Yankees / Red Sox, UNC / Duke, etc,) but in the end, athletes are mostly friendly with each other. Even when athletes get upset or physical with one another, they can remain friends (see Kobe Bryant and Ron Artest).</p>
<p>In the real world, people have a harder time getting along. People divide along political lines, religious lines and country lines.<span id="more-1740"></span></p>
<p>The natural state of people is almost to be at odds with one another. Peace is not just the lack of war. Peace is the active interrelation of two entities in harmonious activity. The opposite of peace is not war, it is merely lack of working together. It is pretty easy for two entities to ignore each other, but that is not peace. Peace is working together. Yet, peace remains so elusive on a grand scale and an individual scale.</p>
<p>This is something that is really hard for me. I honestly (perhaps naively) believe that almost all friction and disagreement is a result of misunderstanding and miscommunication. At our core, we know how to get along but the reality of society and our environment confuses us into discord. Maybe I am wrong, but this what I believe.</p>
<p>That is why seeing this photo was so stirring. It was a photo that showed that when the context changes, when our environment is different, peace is so easy. Sports provides the context for enemies to befriend one another.</p>
<p>Are there two greater enemies in the world today than Israel and Iran?</p>
<p>And yet, below you will see a photo of the best Israeli basketball player, who is now playing for the Sacramento Kings, Omri Casspi and the best Iranian basketball player, playing for the Memphis Grizzlies, Hamed Haddadi. They look like the best of friends. Yet, in their home countries people are dying for their causes in defiance of the opposing cause&#8230;</p>
<p>It is my fervent wish and prayer that we can find peace. Not just peace between nations with differences, but personal peace within ourselves and within our relationships and communities.</p>
<p>Just think of this photo the next time you are about to pass judgment or prolong a disagreement. We can all get along, we can all be a part of peace, we can all unite under the banner of the human race and be tolerant of whoever we encounter.</p>

<p>Tolerance. Love. Peace.</p>
<p>Please.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1610" title="Venice Boardwalk" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/imagesGallery_big05.jpg?resize=240%2C164" alt="Venice Boardwalk" data-recalc-dims="1" />When we are in Venice for Shabbos we stay at wonderful, little, extended stay hotel on the boardwalk called <a href="http://www.sucasavenicebeach.com/" target="_blank">Su Casa</a>. They try and give us an Ocean View Room. It is great to have the ocean view, but not as much for the ocean view as for the &#8220;boardwalk&#8221; view.</p>
<p>You see, Venice Boardwalk is like Mardi Gras every weekend. (See picture to the left.) Street performers, vendors and drunkards line the boardwalk and thousands and thousands of tourists and natives walk back forth as they hawk their wares.</p>
<p>Rami loves the people watching and I must admit, it can be quite addictive!<span id="more-1609"></span></p>
<p>Today we saw, by far, the most ambitious sales pitch on the boardwalk. We were sitting down to lunch with the windows ajar and we heard the following declaration from the boardwalk.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Get your sand here! The very best California sand, just 50 cents! Hand picked sand here! Why walk 5 more feet to the beach when you can get your own handful of sand right here for 50 cents!&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So we went to the window to check it out. It was two teenage boys with a lot of spare time and a great sense of humor. They were just being funny, but they actually kept it up for a few hours. They tried to sell sand to every one who passed them by. Some people gave them a few tips and I think they ended up with a couple dollars.</p>
<p>But it got me thinking. How often are we looking for something and we are willing to make an effort to get it, yet it is right there in front of us. Imagine someone actually bought the sand they were selling. They could just walk 5 feet and get it for free!</p>
<p>I think that sometimes people are looking for things in exotic places and very often what they are looking for is right in front of them. Certainly happiness is this way. People travel to the far corners of the earth in search of happiness. But happiness is right there in front of them. Happiness is a choice.</p>
<p>Love is the same way. People look so hard to find love. But we can always love. Everyone we know can benefit from our love. Our families yearn for our love and to love us back. Again, it is right here in front of us.</p>
<p>Even business opportunities can be the same way. We look and look, but very often, our best opportunities are the ones we already have.</p>
<p>We would never buy sand on the Venice Boardwalk. Let&#8217;s always look at what we have before we look for what we think we do not have&#8230;</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</strong></em></p>
<h1>Lev Tahor, A Pure Heart</h1>
<p>So often understudied, the final <em>parsha</em> in the Torah is as its name implies filled with <em>bracha</em>. In his final words, Moshe Rabbeinu offers us the gift of <em>nitzchiyus.</em></p>
<p><em></em>Indeed, included in his closing blessing to his beloved people are the essential words with which we begin and define the paradigm for our <em>chinuch Habanim</em>, <em>Torah tziva lanu Moshe, morasha kehillas Yaakov!</em> All we must do is follow the lessons contained therein. The entire corpus of <em>Torah</em> is ours. We must treat it, study it and live it as a treasure. As such, we conclude the <em>Torah</em> and start it right over again.<span id="more-1359"></span> We celebrate <em>simchas Torah</em> – the joy of Torah. Although much of the blessing and guidance are found overtly in the text, there are many <em>yesodos</em> that are found only by reading between the lines. One incredible insight is derived from not only looking between the lines but by analyzing the first and last letters of the <em>Torah</em>.</p>
<p>We all know that the <em>Torah</em> begins with the letter “<em>bais</em>” (<strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B</span></em></strong><em>ereishis</em>). <em>V’zos Habracha </em>concludes with the letter “<em>lamed” (</em><em>Yisrae<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>l</strong></span></em><em>) </em>The combination of these two letter spell <em>lev</em>, which means heart. Our <em>chachamim</em> teach us that it is not enough to know <em>Torah</em>; we must feel it – it must be our love. <em>Hashem Yisborach </em>hides this message in the cycle of <em>Torah</em> learning. As we conclude the <em>Torah </em>and begin anew we must give it our heart. Only then will we truly <em>shteig. </em></p>
<p>However, an even deeper insight was once offered by Rav Yaakov Greenwald, <em>shlita</em>. He noted an interesting anomaly. There are three letters which are used to spell out <em>Hashem Yisborach’s </em>name. They are “<em>yud,” “hay</em>” and <em>“vav.” </em>He asked, which letters of the <em>alef bais</em> can form a two letter word by combining with each letter in the <em>Shem Hashem</em>? The <em>gimmel </em>cannot at all – (gi, gah, go). The <em>daled</em> cannot. While it can form the word <em>daay</em>, there is no word <em>dah</em> or <em>do</em>. <em>Zayin</em> can form two words <em>zeh</em>, and <em>zo </em>but there is no word zey, (zayin yud). This is true of almost the entire <em>alef-bais</em> except for two letters.</p>
<p>In fact, only two letters of the <em>aleph-bais</em> can form words with all three of the letters of the <em>Shem Hashem</em>, the <em>lamed (li, lah, lo) </em>and the <em>bais( bi, bah, bo</em>). The message is profound. The only way to be fully <em>misdabeik</em> with the <em>Shechina</em> is with the heart. This is why we <em>daven v’taher</em> <strong><em>libeinu</em></strong><em> lavdicha bemes</em>. Yes, to achieve <em>divekus,</em> to become one with the Almighty we need heart. Let us give it to <em>Hashem Yisborach, </em>unconditionally. In so doing we will merit to fully feel and appreciate that His <em>ahava rabba </em>is truly an <em>ahavas olam.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/09/17/kim-clijsters-tennis-champion-and-mother/" target="_blank">Earlier today I posted about Kim Clijsters and the sacrifices of working mothers</a>.</p>
<p>It must be the impending Rosh Hashana that is influencing these thoughts of parents and children.</p>
<p>Parenting is tough job. There are no vacations. There is no financial remuneration. It is oftentimes thankless.</p>
<p>Also we are so clueless as to how to parent. Babies don&#8217;t come with a handy manual or set of instructions. The questions all parents have are endless.<span id="more-1185"></span></p>
<p>To punish or not? When to compliment? To be honest with our children about their shortcomings? I always think about Simon Cowell asking some terrible &#8220;singer&#8221; if anyone ever told them that they are just not talented. And then they cut to that parents telling their kid how great they are. No one wants to be that parent.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/health/15mind.html?em" target="_blank">very popular article in the NY Times about parenting this week</a>. The article explains, based on a study by 2 Israeli researchers, that conditional love can be just as harmful to children as punishment. Meaning, when a parent only doles out love for their child when the child performs as the parent expects the affect on the child is the same as punishing the child when the parent disapproves of the child&#8217;s behavior. The child may accomplish more, but will ultimately feel resentment, anxiety and feel unhappy.</p>
<p>The proper way to love one&#8217;s children is unconditionally.</p>
<p>Love is not a tool that we wield to bend the child into submission. Every child needs the love of its parents. Always.</p>
<p>This is a message we can take into Rosh Hashana. It is true that it is a day of judgment and that can give us reason to pause and be fearful of our verdict. There is a Judge and there is judgment.</p>
<p>We have one saving grace. The Judge is our Father.</p>
<p>The relationship that we have with God is the same as the relationship that a parent has with a child. Unconditional love.</p>
<p>When it comes to our moment of judgment in the heavenly court we know that we are unconditionally loved by our Father in Heaven no matter how far we may strayed from His path. Just remember that our Father is waiting for us with a warm embrace.</p>
<p>Children that feel unconditionally loved have less problems feeling accepted later in life. Unconditional love is the greatest gift a parent can provide for their children. Sometimes it may seem hard when children frustrate us.</p>
<p>A great video has been circling the internet the last couple of days.</p>
<p>The video really illustrates what I have been saying in this post. Even when our children frustrate us, we must love them unconditionally. Even if we &#8220;frustrate&#8221; God, He has a warm embrace for us. He is our father.</p>
<p>The father in this video looks like he is about to get frustrated with his daughter. Then he embraces her.</p>
<p>Perfect imagery for this post. Enjoy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have not been to a lot of funerals in my life. I have been blessed.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening my family celebrated Sheva Brachos for a cousin in my parents home. It was a joyous occasion.</p>
<p>Immediately following its conclusion, I walked the 200 feet from my parent&#8217;s home to the neighborhood shul. At about 11:00 PM a very moving funeral began.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of these two events and the nature of the deceased brought tremendous emotion. What follows is an attempt to do those feelings justice in writing.</p>
<p><span id="more-924"></span>When I was 12 my family moved to a fledgling Monsey community, our sole neighbors up the block were the Glucks.</p>
<p>Blessed with wonderful children, the Glucks were proud and humble people. Performing anonymous kindnesses was a hallmark of their lives.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, tragedy struck a few short years ago when Mrs. Gluck was taken from this world. The tragedy shook up the neighborhood. It was one the my parent&#8217;s first contemporaries death and it was painful for everyone.</p>
<p>The Glucks were resilient. They bounced back. The children were successful in achieving their goals and Mr. Gluck, Moish (George) Gluck remarries.</p>
<p>Yesterday, tragedy struck again. Driving home from work, Moish Gluck suffered a fatal heart attack, literally yards away from his home.</p>
<p>The pain is indescribable. Four surviving children under 30. The oldest was my classmate. The youngest my sister&#8217;s age. A recently married widow. A community still reeling from the untimely departure of Mrs. Gluck, now struck again is left to help repair their torn hearts and help the family pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>Listening to the youngest Gluck eulogize his father last night was one of the most emotionally difficult moments of my life. The cracking in his voice, coupled with his eloquent words were too much for me to bear. I cried. Tears were streaming down my face. It was the first time I have cried freely at a funeral in my life.</p>
<p>I, as countless others, my father included, owe Moish Gluck tremendous gratitude for a variety of things. In my case, the gratitude I have for Moish Gluck directly correlates to my profession as a Rabbi and a teacher. The mere fact that you are reading this post, is somewhat due to Moish Gluck.</p>
<p>Moish Gluck was my first employer. As a 12 year old neighborhood kid, Moish Gluck gave me my first opportunity to teach. Their eldest son needed someone to study Mishna with him. I was asked, and given a fair remuneration for my time.</p>
<p>I will never forget preparing for those sessions. Teaching Torah to the boy who was just 3 years my junior, was my first taste of the joys of teaching, and I will never forget that. I will never forget the smile on the boy&#8217;s parents faces when they gave me my monthly stipend. I will never forget the encouragement that Moish Gluck gave me, in the face of my first challenge to teach.</p>
<p>It must have been a good experience as since then I have been teaching in many capacities. As a Campus Rabbi, as a High School adviser for Yeshiva Students and Public School Students, and now as the Rabbi of the Pacific Jewish Center I draw upon my first moments as a teacher. All directly caused by a man whose friends and neighbors will all miss, Moish Gluck.</p>
<p>If this post were on paper and the words written in ink, my tears would stain the paper instead of falling onto the desk from where I type.</p>
<p>Let us remember to cherish the ones we love. Let us enjoy each second we spend with the people we care for most. Let us not waste the opportunities we have for love and friendship.</p>
<p>It was too difficult for my ears to hear a loving son pine for one more moment with his precious father. If we have those moments let us treasure them.</p>

<p>Those who know me personally will attest that I am not a card carrying member of the &#8220;Woe is us, anti-anti-semitism&#8221; club. However, I did recently <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/10/jew-kipedia-and-tolerance/" target="_blank">blog</a> about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/11/political-discrimination/" target="_blank">tolerance</a> and therefore this video clip is relevant. I do not endorse any comments made by the person who posted this video on You Tube. The only reason I am posting this video is to illustrate that Hate exists. Hate is ugly and Hate needs to stop.</p>
<p>I make these comments to address those who may hate me or us from outside of Judaism and equally to my Jewish brethren. <span id="more-332"></span>We have enough people who hate us, we can&#8217;t afford any discord amongst ourselves. We have too much in common to focus on the differences. When you watch this video I think you should consider if there is too much hate in your life. If there is too much hate &#8211; you gotta get rid of it.</p>
<p>Try this mantra: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be a hater&#8221;.</p>
<p>It may help&#8230;</p>
<p>Video is below.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='980' height='582' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/QBF-1uc-SYc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>This is in America, in Chicago. What do you think is going on in Europe and the Middle East?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I was checking out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and I was browsing the &#8220;Main Page&#8221;. You can always find an article by searching Wikipedia but you can also browse interesting tidbits on Main Page. Sections like &#8220;On this day&#8221; and &#8220;Did you know&#8221; display linked Wikipedia articles for your enjoyment. This page changes frequently, at least several times per day.</p>
<p>At the precise moment that I was looking at the page I saw this:</p>
<p><span id="more-326"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-325 alignleft" title="Wikipedia | Did You Know?" src="http://i2.wp.com/rabbifink.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/wikipedia-clip.gif?resize=405%2C392" alt="Wikipedia | Did You Know?" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>As you can see, there are 8 bullet points. Three of the eight articles directly relate to something Jewish. That is a very high percentage (38%).</p>
<p>The Jewish population is estimated at around 13 million. The world population is at around 6.8 billion. Some quick math puts the Jewish world population at just under .2%.</p>
<p>The sampling of those Wikipedia articles is way disproportionate to the number of Jewish people in the world. Maybe we should just call it Jew-kipedia.</p>
<p>It is not surprising though. There have been 180 Jewish Nobel Prize winners (that&#8217;s a lot) and we have been around for a long time. The impact the Jewish people have had on the world has been the topic of many books. Perhaps the best of those books is &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Jews-Paul-Johnson/dp/0060915331" target="_blank">A History of the Jews</a>&#8221; by Paul Johnson who is a scholar on Christianity.</p>
<p>What is somewhat troublesome however is the still rampant anti-semitism that exists. The Jewish population is so small yet still garners hatred and disdain from so many. It&#8217;s 2009 people, time to move on! <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3669706,00.html" target="_blank">This article</a> is particularly troubling. 31% of Euros think that the Jewish people are responsible for the economic crisis! How is that even possible? Where do they come up with this stuff?</p>
<p>If you need more and you&#8217;re a glutton for punishment, then read <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123180033807075069.html" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>
<p>Really, all you need to do is a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=jew&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank">google search</a> for &#8220;Jew&#8221;.</p>
<p>Our world has progressed so much and yet we remain so backwards in so many ways. One word that needs to be taught and emphasized over and over again is tolerance.</p>
<p>Within the Jewish community we are just as guilty of this. We need to be tolerant of each other and our various customs as well. We have to find the common ground between us. Harmony and love will bring our world to a better place. Divisiveness and scorn certainly won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Say it: Tolerance, tolerance, tolerance.</p>
<p>Now do it: Tolerate, tolerate, tolerate.</p>
