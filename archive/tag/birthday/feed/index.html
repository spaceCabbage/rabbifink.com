It&#8217;s not a gag. It&#8217;s serious. It&#8217;s a 106th birthday party cake. Bet you never thought you would see on of those&#8230;</p>
<p>Last week I had the honor of attending a very special birthday party. A friend of Pacific Jewish Center, Betty Matoff, celebrated her 106th birthday. I can think of nothing better to write about in my 500th post.</p>
<p>Betty was born in 1904 on Christmas Eve. 1904. That was a long time ago.</p>
<p>Incredibly, she is sharp, coherent, hilarious and almost completely independent. She is a marvel to spend with and it is an honor to have attended her birthday party.<span id="more-3535"></span></p>
<p>What I find most amazing is that she has been independent almost her entire adult life. She had a short marriage and despite being born in before women had the right to vote, she has managed quite nicely on her own! I am not saying I find her choice attractive or correct. I am saying that she bucked tradition and it worked in her favor. She has lived a very happy and fulfilling life despite, for the most part, lack of companionship.</p>
<p>When asked what the secret to living such a long, rich life, Betty said to &#8220;love as many people as you can&#8221;.</p>
<p>Great advice from a great woman.</p>
<p>Check out a couple photos from the party below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was my birthday.</p>
<p>I am not huge &#8220;birthday guy&#8221;. I love my children&#8217;s birthday more than my own birthday and my mother loves my birthday more than I do.</p>
<p>A lot of people know my birthday. Co-workers, family and friends all know my birthday. This year I got a ton of birthday wishes.</p>
<p>But it was different.</p>
<p><span id="more-873"></span></p>
<p>One summer when I was in sleepaway camp on my birthday I got like 250 &#8220;in person&#8221; birthday wishes. The guy who made the breakfast anouncements said &#8220;the 100th person who wishes Eliyahu Fink a Happy Birthday gets a free soda&#8221;. Everyone wanted a free soda so throughout the day random kids were wishing me Happy Birthday. I like that. It felt good to be acknowledged (birthday or not&#8230;).</p>
<p>This year, I was not in sleepaway camp and there were no contests.</p>
<p>I got 7 in person happy birthdays.</p>
<p>I got 2 phonecall happy birthdays.</p>
<p>I got <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=e_fink+happy" target="_blank">8 Twitter</a> timeline happy birthdays.</p>
<p>I got 3 Twitter direct message happy birthdays.</p>
<p>I got 2 SMS Text happy birthdays.</p>
<p>I gotÂ <a href="http://facebook.com/eliyahufink" target="_blank">39 Facebook</a> happy birthdays.</p>
<p>Notice a trend?</p>
<p>Yes, technology contributed tremendously to my birthday wishes.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have any major commentary about this, I just think it is notable. Social networking plays such an important role in our 2009 lives. It is not going to change so if you are not yet on <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">Twitter </a>or Facebook or leaving comments on blogs, you are a little behind the curve.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s okay. I am not saying we all need to be ahead of the curve. What I am saying is our world is trending into a more digital era.</p>
<p>Be ready!</p>
