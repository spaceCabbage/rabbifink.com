				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This might be the oddest thing to come across my desk(top) in a while:</p>
<p>There is a fairly well known legend that the great holy R&#8217; Kaduri &#8220;met the Messiah&#8221; sometime before he died. R&#8217; Kaduri was estimated to be between 110 and 118 when he passed away. The legend says R&#8217; Kaduri revealed this information in a note to be opened one year after his death. This is vehemently denied by many of his supporters and family members. Others insist it is true and claim to be witnesses of both events.</p>
<p>There is a note floating around and it says something. Some say the note is real and others say the note is fake. The note says:<span id="more-7799"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;בעניין הר&#8221;ת של משיח. ירים העם ויוכיח שדברו ותורתו עומדים. באתי על החתום בחודש הרחמים התשס&#8221;ה, יצחק כדורי&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The note says to it is providing the &#8220;<em>rashei teivot</em>&#8221; of the Messiah. Rashei teivot are the first letters of the words in the sentence. The first letters of the words in the note spell Yehoshua.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/w80yt4.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7801" alt="w80yt4" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/w80yt4.jpg?resize=230%2C360" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>A Christian &#8220;writer&#8221; and &#8220;filmmaker&#8221; is promoting a book and documentary about the note. I won&#8217;t spend the money to buy it. But <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/11/did-jewish-rabbi-really-see-messiah/" target="_blank">a review on WND.com</a> spills the beans. This fellow claims that Yehoshua refers to Jesus. And R&#8217; Kaduri was alluding to the Christian Messiah in his note. He is promoting his work by hinting to the fact that a great Jewish rabbi believed in Jesus.</p>
<p>This is utter nonsense.</p>
<p>If the legend is true, and I am not convinced that it is true, the first letters of a sentence spelling Yehoshua are not a reference to Jesus. No way. No how. Just stop.</p>
<p>If R&#8217; Kaduri thought Christianity was the true religion, maybe he wouldn&#8217;t have practiced Judaism with passion and fervor his entire life?! Is the claim that a man of over 110 years old who practiced halachic Judaism for his entire life was actually knowingly living a lie even remotely plausible?! No. And even if he did, wouldn&#8217;t he just tell them straight out? I can understand hiding the name of Messiah in a classic Kabbalistic manner with an acrostic or roshei teivot. But to hide the true religion and subject all one&#8217;s followers to hell?! Makes not one bit of sense.</p>
<p>It makes me sick that this huckster is co-opting one of our venerated rabbis to promote his version of Christianity. It makes me even sicker that he is going to be financially capitalizing on a complete misinterpretation of R&#8217; Kaduri&#8217;s note. But maybe he is just following the lead of so many Jewish charlatans who sold amulets and charms that were supposedly blessed by R&#8217; Kaduri.</p>
<p>Christians should believe that their religion is true. But they should not be using devout Jewish leaders to fraudulently boost their religion.</p>
<p>(See R&#8217; Josh Waxman&#8217;s article and comments on this from 2007: <a href="http://parsha.blogspot.com/2007/02/handwriting-analysis-of-rav-kaduris.html" target="_blank">ParshaBlog</a>)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/15246_4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7068" alt="15246_4" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/15246_4.jpg?resize=300%2C232" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This week I was in filming my father&#8217;s school in Monsey, Ateres Bais Yaakov, for their annual dinner. I always swell with pride as I get an intimate look at this incredible school. It is remarkable how much the students love their school, their teachers, Torah, and learning.</p>
<p>One of the highlights for me is always observing (and filming) a high school Chumash class. At Ateres, the girls are challenged to actively participate in their learning and ask questions during class.</p>
<p>In particular, Chumash is not so much taught, as it is learned. The students rigorously and precisely translate the words of the text, analyze the text for grammatical or other anomalies, and compile a list of questions for each verse. Only once that task is complete does the teacher begin to introduce the commentaries and interpretations of the great medieval commentators.</p>
<p>In this way, the various ways of learning the verse are not simply abstract interpretive choices made by great Torah scholars, rather they are solutions to problems in the text which give way to novel and illuminating interpretations. This is how the Rishonim learned Chumash. They were masters of diction and grammar. When they read a verse, they knew if the verse was rendered perfectly or if it needed interpretation. They knew all of this because, of course, they were experts in Biblical language and grammar. That expertise formed the basis for all their interpretations.</p>
<p><span id="more-7067"></span></p>
<p>i think it is great that young women are learning Chumash in the same manner as our rishonim. It was also really enjoyable to be a fly on the wall for a class like this and that is what got me thinking.</p>
<p>In my yeshiva high school we were responsible to learn the parsha every week and we were tested on Chumash with Rashi every Sunday. This way we all became familiar with the storyline and mitzvos in the Torah while also learning the most well known commentary. To me, it was a way to learn information. What does the Torah say and what does that mean? But we learned no skills (unless zipping through the Birnbaum Chumash with Rashi in English in 30 minutes and scoring a 95 on the test is a skill) and we did not get an appreciation for why Rashi chose the interpretations in his commentary. Nor were we acutely aware that there are many other equally valid interpretations on each verse in the Chumash. Certainly we had no ability to explain why each commentary chose its interpretation over the other.</p>
<p>Yet, at least in this high school, the girls are learning all of that. I mentioned this to R&#8217; Gil Student at our little <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101527642993025" target="_blank">Asifa</a> in Manhattan and he told me that he learned Chumash the way the Bais Yaakov girls learn Chumash in his left wing modern orthodox high school. (He also said that half his classmates are not orthodox today.) I can&#8217;t speak for modern orthodox high schools. But I can speak for yeshivos. The most rigorous Chumash curriculum mirrors my experience. Unfortunately, I think most yeshivos have far less Chumash learning that what I experienced.</p>
<p>I think we need to work on this. I think that we have a lot to gain by teaching Chumash the way <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/06/book-review-dovbear-on-the-parsha/" target="_blank">Dov Bear</a> and <a href="http://parsha.blogspot.com" target="_blank">R&#8217; Josh Waxman</a> approach Chumash. We need to cultivate the skills necessary and an appreciation for true Chumash study.</p>
<p>Learning Chumash the way our ancestors learned Chumash requires a working knowledge of grammar, an open forum to ask questions, and a little bit of reprogramming about our Mesorah. Those are all good things. As a side benefit I think this will help us meet some of the challenges presented by modern scholarship.</p>
<p>At the very least, every kollel guy should have a seder with his wife where she teaches him Chumash the way she learned it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6936" alt="baby" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby.png?resize=300%2C294" data-recalc-dims="1" />The beginning of Parshas Tazria instructs the Jewish people on commandments that relate to matters of childbirth. One law sates that a woman who gives birth is ritually impure for seven days if she bears a son and fourteen days if she bears a daughter.</p>
<p>The Torah does not tell us why there is a difference between the days of ritual impurity for a son and a daughter. Naturally, this led our great rabbis to speculate and provide their own insights into these laws. Inevitably these commentaries will reflect the social and scientific norms of their milieu.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to track the development of these ideas.</p>
<p>Two general categories of interpretations are given to explain the discrepancy between the days of impurity for a son and a daughter. One category goes the social route and the other goes the medical route.<span id="more-6935"></span></p>
<p>The social route generally considers sons to be a great blessing and daughters to be a bit of a curse. Rabbi Josh Waxman has a great example of one medieval commentator who takes this tack (see: <a href="http://parsha.blogspot.com/2013/04/guys-rule-in-tazria.html">Guys rule in Tazria</a>). One can see hints of this sort of thinking in the Talmud as well. Boys earned money for the family while girls were a financial strain on the ancient family. Thus, it follows that there would be a longer period of ritual impurity for a daughter because it was less joyous. I&#8217;m not sure how this actually works logically, but you do see this line of thinking.</p>
<p>The medical route considers the birth of a son to be easier or to expel less blood or that girls are born &#8220;cooler&#8221; so the mother needs longer to heal because coolness causes illness or that boys are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 40 days and girls are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 80 days. These are ideas found in the Rishonim to explain the double waiting time for a daughter.</p>
<p>None of these reasons would satisfy the modern reader of the Chumash. No matter how &#8220;frum&#8221; one may be, these explanations don&#8217;t work anymore. Either because girls no longer cost more than boys, or because daughters are not considered a curse. Further, we know that the medicine found in these interpretations is incorrect as well.</p>
<p>Artscroll, which is by and large very traditionalist in their interpretations, shies away from these ancient commentaries as well. They are almost forced to pluck a beautiful idea from a very unlikely source to give some sort of explanation here. Artscroll quotes R&#8217; Dovid Tzvi Hoffman (late 19th century) who says that really the appropriate amount of days would be fourteen days. But since we want the mother of the child to attend the Bris Milah the Torah subtracts some time from the ritual impurity and knocks it down to seven days so that she will be able to participate in her son&#8217;s entering of the covenant.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Hoffman&#8217;s answer is lovely. But it is not found in earlier commentaries. The reason for that is because up until recently, the other interpretations were plausible. Once those interpretations became anachronistic, another interpretation was needed. R&#8217; Hoffman provides one such interpretation. Artscroll is written for 21st century Jews. They wisely choose the newer, more modern interpretation for their publication.</p>
<p>The beginning of the parsha also features some ancient science on conception. The verse says that a &#8220;woman who seeds a seed a births a son.&#8221; The implication is that the son is born because because the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221;. The Talmud explains that when the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a son. When the man &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a daughter. Ramban explains that the woman&#8217;s blood meets the man&#8217;s semen and they are the two ingredients that form the child. Whichever is &#8220;first&#8221; determines the gender. With this (wrong) medical explanation, the verse makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Ramban also brings the Greek version of conception which is different and has nothing to do with who is first. So he then explains how the verse is rendered if one holds like the Greeks! Ramban says that the word simply means seed in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>What are we to make of all this?</p>
<p>First of all, we see several examples of interpretations from ancient times that no longer work today. We are forced to abandon these commentaries and seek out newer commentaries. More importantly, it means that the ancient commentaries were based on conventional wisdom of their times. They did the best they could with what they had available to them. But their commentaries were not infallible. Particularly in areas of matters that are flux we cannot avoid the conclusion that they made mistakes and that their science or social conventions were not Divine.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think we see that even Ramban himself wasn&#8217;t so sure that Chazal were right about conception. He quotes the Greeks and gives a less elegant interpretation of the verse to reconcile their view. What does this mean? It means that when science buttresses up against the words of a verse, we are forced to reconcile the verse using creative interpretations. That must be allowed. After all the Ramban did just that. Today we are faced with similar challenges. Sometimes the old, simpler interpretations no longer work. What would Ramban do? He would reinterpret. But who among us has the shoulders of Ramban? Anyone? No one?</p>
<p>It is possible that the next Ramban is in our midst today. But with our somewhat stifling manner of Chumash study which hardly allows for innovation and reinterpretation, how will our Ramban ever show himself? Or perhaps she is a she? Who knows? One thing is clear, we don&#8217;t learn or teach Chumash the same way our ancestors learned Chumash. Instead we teach Chumash <em>the way our ancestors taught it.</em> I think we can do better.</p>
