				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Due to an easy to make error, I mistook two commenters for the same person. In my Disqus Comments Dashboard, it appeared that the two commenters had one IP address. Upon further investigation, they in fact have two IP addresses. The fact that they both do not provide their email addresses complicated things and I recommend using an email address to comment so I can communicate with you all off blog as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I accused them of being one and the same.</p>
<p>They are not.</p>
<p>I apologize for my mistake. I deleted all comments that were a result of my error. None and bayshanimrachmianim, I am sorry.</p>
<p>I HATE deleting comments. I cringe when I click that delete button. But in this instance it was necessary. I apologize for deleting the comments as well.</p>
<p>But, I do reserve the right to delete comments that are personal attacks against me. I am the judge of what I feel is a personal attack and if you attack me personally, you may be deleted and eventually banned. Yes, I can do that.</p>
<p>Most importantly I don&#8217;t believe that a person&#8217;s name or prior opinions or credentials make an argument. Arguments or opinions should be judged and discussed on their own merit. Discuss the ideas on this blog. Don&#8217;t discuss who said the ideas.</p>
<p>On that note I would like to thank Glenn Beck for his unabashed support of the victims in Itamar killing. Mr. Beck makes some incorrect points (as per usual) but his support and compassion are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Does this mean that I retract previous statements about Beck? No. Do I think I should apologize to Beck for calling him out on another occasion? No.</p>
<p>It means that I judge his commentary, not him. Sometimes he is right. Sometimes he is wrong. I don&#8217;t believe anyone is always right nor is anyone always wrong. I believe ideas should be discussed civilly and vehemently.</p>
<p>That is what this blog is all about. I share my thoughts and you think about them, criticize them if you want and consider them for yourselves. I invite you all to continue spending some of your valuable time reading and commenting. I hope that I will not make the same mistake I made today again.</p>
<p>Watch Glenn Beck on the Itamar murders:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="Glenn Beck" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.prisonplanet.com/images/september2009/150909top3.jpg?resize=371%2C182" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />I know that Glenn Beck is primarily an entertainer. I don&#8217;t think most people take him to be a scholar or expert on most important matters. He is a radio personality. He has a nice voice, a good shtick and a loyal following. Sure, I found his Nazi references ironic (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/27/glenn-beck-and-peta-in-lockstep-goose-step-on-international-holocaust-remembrance-day/" target="_blank">Glenn Beck and PETA in Lockstep (Goose Step?) on International Holocaust Remembrance Day</a>). But overall, I don&#8217;t care all that much what he has to say. In much the same way that I don&#8217;t care what more liberal entertainers have to say. It&#8217;s just entertainment.</p>
<p>But yesterday, Beck made another inane comment that made me realize something.<span id="more-3836"></span></p>
<p>First, the context:</p>
<p>Beck is talking about the 400 rabbis who took out an ad to protest his Nazi references. His point has been that these rabbis are not really religious rabbis, they are social action rabbis who don&#8217;t care about religion. Instead they &#8220;worship&#8221; liberalism. So there is no reason to take them seriously.</p>
<p>Now here is the comment:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“When you talk about rabbis, understand that most &#8212; most people who are not Jewish don&#8217;t understand that there are the Orthodox rabbis, and then there are the reformed rabbis. Reformed rabbis are generally political in nature. It&#8217;s almost like Islam, radicalized Islam in a way, to where it is just &#8212; radicalized Islam is less about religion than it is about politics. When you look at the reform Judaism, it is more about politics.”</em></p>
<p>My only real commentary on this is that the when you make an analogy you can be as broad or as narrow as you want. You could analogize the Religious Right in the GOP to radicalized Islam too. Watch this: the Religious Right in the GOP is just like radical Islam, they want to enforce a religious law on all people. See what I did there? Anyway, the test of an analogy is to see if it makes sense in any other contexts. So, do radicalized Islam and the GOP share anything else? Not really. So it&#8217;s a dumb analogy.</p>
<p>Reform Rabbis and radicalized Islam share even less.</p>
<p>Oh and FYI, Orthodox Rabbis are also plenty about politics.</p>
<p>But here is what this whole thing got me thinking: Almost a couple hundred years ago, Reform Judaism was in its infancy and was gaining traction among the young Orthodox Jews in Germany. People were jumping off the orthodox bandwagon by the dozen. It presented a real problem for the future of Orthodox Judaism. In response, two general approaches were developed. The Chasam Sofer and Rav Samson Rafael Hirsch the leaders of each. They each tried as best they could to stem the tide of those abandoning Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>No matter their tactics, it turns out that today Reform Judaism and Orthodox Judaism have very little to do with each other. Further, the bandwagons have very few people jumping back and forth between them. For almost all Jews today, there is no conscious choice between Reform and Orthodox. Most stay where they are or leave organized religion entirely.</p>
<p>My point is that practically speaking, there is no longer a battle between Reform and Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Yet, the rhetoric from both sides still sounds like it is 1860. Most Orthodox Jewish rabbis would probably agree with Beck that Reform Rabbis are not &#8220;real&#8221; rabbis. Orthodox Rabbis frequently confuse the word &#8220;Jew&#8221; with &#8220;orthodox&#8221; and basically call anyone not orthodox, not Jewish. I doubt we will see too many Orthodox Rabbis &#8220;defend the honor&#8221; of their reform counterparts.</p>
<p>(Similarly, I cannot recall hearing an Orthodox Rabbi being praised by a Reform Rabbi. It just doesn&#8217;t happen.)</p>
<p>I hereby offer my puny voice. I disagree with Beck. I think Reform Rabbis are learned, spiritual leaders and teachers who are important for the future of Judaism.</p>
<p>Really, even the most cynical of Orthodox Rabbis should agree with this. Why? Because if not for Reform Judaism, almost all secular Jews would completely lose their connection to Judaism. Isn&#8217;t it better, even from an orthodox perspective that Jews retain a Jewish identity? Marry other Jews? Contribute to the social welfare of the world? Come to shul on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur? How about every Shabbos? Advocate for Israel? Isn&#8217;t Judaism as a whole stronger if there is a reform movement?</p>
<p>I think the answer is yes.</p>
<p>I will even take it a step further. Reform Judaism challenged Rav Hirsch and the Chasam Sofer to sharpen their hashkafos and approach to Judaism. Today Reform Judaism challenges us to fine tune our observance as well (within the construct of halacha of course). Without mentioning specifics, I think it is worth noting  that Orthodox Judaism is being challenged by Reform Judaism in a good way. It&#8217;s a mild form of kinas sofrim (competition among scholars). That is also a good thing.</p>
<p>So in summary, I think Glenn Beck&#8217;s obtuse criticism of &#8220;Reformed Rabbis&#8221; is misguided. He probably thinks that all reform Jews are evil and not &#8220;really Jews&#8221; just like many Orthodox Jews. (Where would he get this from? Let&#8217;s just say there are some Orthodox Jews in his ear&#8230;) But I disagree. I salute Reform Judaism and its Rabbis. Although we may disagree about theology, we all desire for Judaism to remain strong and vibrant. Like many presumed enemies, we have much more in common than we may think and if the rhetoric is toned down, we may actually be able to work side by side (even if not hand in hand) towards our common goals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/holoc-musem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3687 alignleft" title="holocaust musem" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/holoc-musem.jpg?resize=330%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Holocaust was a horrific stain on modern history. Twentieth century civilization was far too advanced for a world to witness or fail to to witness the systematic killing of millions of innocent people. It is an equally abhorrent stain on 21st century civilization that mini-Holocausts are happening around the world at this very moment.</p>
<p>They are &#8220;mini&#8221; because they are smaller in size and slightly less abhorrent for the simple reason that the Holocaust was perpetrated by one of the most advanced groups of people in the modern world. The mini-Holocausts occurring around the world are by and large in 3rd world countries where lawlessness is more expected than early 20th century Germany. So I call them mini-Holocausts. Fair enough?</p>
<p>The Holocaust is in the news today for a few reasons.<span id="more-3686"></span></p>
<p>First of all it is the International Holocaust Remembrance Day. The <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37397&amp;Cr=holocaust&amp;Cr1=" target="_blank">U.N.</a>, the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/01/27/statement-president-international-holocaust-remembrance-day" target="_blank">President</a> and <a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/01/27/google-archive-brings-holocaust-memory-into-the-digital-age/" target="_blank">Google</a> (among others) are all using this day to spread the ideals of peace, love and tolerance. There are a lot of Holocaust remembrance days. I am torn between thinking that there cannot be enough and that too much awareness is likely to have less effect. There is no right answer but it&#8217;s worth considering.</p>
<p>I like the universal message of Holocaust remembrance that teaches that tolerance and understanding can help prevent future Holocaust-like slaughter of humans. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/12/my-visit-to-the-museum-of-tolerance-at-the-simon-wiesenthal-center/">My Visit to the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center</a>) To me that is the most important lesson that can be learned from Holocaust studies and memorials.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the second reason the Holocaust is in the news today. Some rabbis are upset that Glenn Beck overuses the Holocaust when making analogies to pretty much anything. The Internet has long known that all arguments evenrually end when one party makes a Nazi analogy. This is known rule called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law">Godwin&#8217;s Law</a>. While it is annoying and plays to emotions (one way or the other) this is a fact of life. Beck is just doing what everyone else does.</p>
<p>That being said, it would be nice if he were a bit more sensitive. Words carry weight, have power and meaning. But that weight, power and meaning can be diluted when the words themselves are overused in less powerful contexts. Beck is doing a disservice to the word Holocaust and the negative connotations of Nazis by overusing those words.</p>
<p>Beck is not alone.</p>
[I don&#8217;t like it when rabbis call the 21st century a &#8220;spiritual Holocaust&#8221;. A) it&#8217;s not and B) Holocaust? Come on. Poor choice of words.]
<p>And PETA does the same thing. They have called the slaughter of chickens a Holocaust. I find that equally disturbing.</p>
<p>Who knew Beck and PETA would ever share a criticism&#8230;?</p>
<p>And that is the irony of it all. Beck nor PETA exemplifies the very important message of the Holocaust. Tolerance. Love. Understanding. Both are polarizing. Both sensationalize. And both display a very poor understanding of when to use certain powerful words.</p>
