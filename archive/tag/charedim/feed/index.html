				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The best database of <em>seforim </em>(books written about Torah topics are called <em>seforim</em> even though the word just means books, it has connotations of holiness and importance) is Otzar HaHochma. The Otzar has every sefer you could possibly need. They have 47,350 books in the their database. Each of them is searchable so you can really find anything that&#8217;s been written about anything.</p>
<p>Searching is free but reading and printing cost money. Full, unlimited access costs a lot of money. (If you&#8217;d like to sponsor a subscription for me, I&#8217;ll graciously accept.)</p>
<p>There are several tiers of Otzar subscriptions. Here is the current pricelist:<span id="more-7450"></span></p>
<p><b>The Complete Otzar HaHochma – 47,350 books Cost: $1,890<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7452" alt="Censored Stamp Shows Prohibited And Censorship" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fathers-day-gift-ideas-8.jpg" /></b></p>

<p><b>Bnei Torah Edition – 45,150 books Cost: $1,685</b></p>
<p>Identical to the complete Otzar HaHochma but contains 1,200 less books. Certain books whose world outlook did not correspond to that of the Hareidi sector have been removed.</p>
<p><b>Otzar Gemara Ve’Halacha – 30,700 books Cost: $1,400</b></p>
<p>Thousands of books covering topics such as Mishnah and commentary, Babylonian Talmud and commentary, Jerusalem Talmud and commentary, Reponsa, Shulchan Aruch and commentary, halacha u’minhag, Torah files.</p>
<p><b>Otzar Torah U’Machshava – 26,400 books Cost: $1,250</b></p>
<p>Thousands of books covering such topics as Tanach and commentary, Chazal, Kabbalah, philosophy and ethics, Hassidism, Drushim, Jewish holidays, Jewish history, prayers and hymns and various others as well.</p>
<p><b>The Library Edition – 47,350 books Cost: $1,170 </b>This version includes all 41,500 books in the Complete Otzar edition, as well as all program options other than <b>the free</b> <b>search option</b>.</p>
<p><b>To add 880 books of Mosad Harav Kook (670 books in Bnei Torah Edition) Cost: $320</b></p>
<p>880 books (670 in bnei Torah edition) from the important publisher – basic works in all Torah fields in precise and<br />
uptodate editions: <i>Chidushei HaRitva, Rashba</i>, <i>Ran</i>, <i>Tosafot HaRosh</i>, <i>Mefarshei Hamikra Harishonim </i>series, <i>Torat Chaim </i>series<i>, Torah Umegilot, Tshuvot HaGeonim</i>, <i>Rishonim and Acharonim, Daat Mikra </i>on <i>Nach </i>series, <i>hagut </i>and <i>mussar</i>, <i>piyut </i>and <i>tefila</i>, research and bibliography, history, Hebrew Linguistics and much more.</p>
<p><b>To add 405 books of Machon Yerushalayim Publications Cost: $230</b></p>
<p>This unique package from a leading publisher of Jewish religious publications includes hundreds of books by <i>rishonim </i>and <i>acharonim</i>, such as <i>Shulchan Arukh Hashalem,Otzar Mefarshei Hatalmud, Sidrat Tshuvot Harishonim, Minchat Chinuch Hashalem, Noda Beyehuda Responsa, Sidrot Gedolei Ashkenaz, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, </i>and <i>Ohr Hamizrach</i><i>.</i></p>
<p><b>To add 420 Books of Ahavat Shalom Publishers Cost: $170</b></p>
<p>420 books of the Ahavat Shalom Publishers, including books published for the first time from manuscripts as well as fundamental books.</p>
<p><b>To add 4,200 books of Kehot Publication Society (Chabad) Cost: $ 90</b></p>
<p>An extensive collection of Chabad publications, including ancient and rare books, as well as all basic Chasidic sources, Torah files, history books, and albums. The collection has been made possible through the generous<br />
assistance of Kehat Publishing.</p>
<p><b>Network license</b>: <b>$210 </b>for each station.</p>
<p>Notice anything interesting?</p>
<p>The full database includes 47,350 books. But one can get a 45,150 book version as well. (Otzar thinks this is 1200 fewer books. It&#8217;s actually 2200). This version is called the &#8220;Bnei Torah&#8221; edition. The words bnei Torah are used to imply one is a yeshiva student or charedi. It&#8217;s unfortunate that one cannot be considered a modern ben Torah, but such is the foible of language. So if you are a ben Torah you don&#8217;t want access to 2,200 of the books on the Otzar database. These books are deemed inappropriate for charedim because they are inconsistent with charedi perspectives.</p>
<p>This is incredible. All the books in the Otzar are frum texts. They are all legitimate <em>seforim</em> from reputable Torah scholars. Yet, a small segment of these books is not consistent with charedi thinking. Well of course not! Not everything in Judaism has always been charedi. That much is obvious to any Torah scholar. But in order to reinforce an imaginary history where nothing was inconsistent with charedi Judaism, these books are excised from the subscription. It&#8217;s really amazing. These are not anti-orthodox books. That&#8217;s for sure. These are just books that &#8220;do not correspond to the Haredi sector.&#8221; Turns out, it&#8217;s forbidden to read books that might inform you that your way of life is not the only way of life that is legitimate within orthodox Judaism. Pretty sad.</p>
<p>As for me, I want a list of these 2200 books. I also want to know who the censor is and what the criteria are for removal from the Bnei Torah list. I also want to learn those 2200 seforim, pronto.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The new issue of The New Republic cover story is about us. It is about Haredim, modern Orthodox, and women. These are things we discuss regularly online and at our Shabbos tables, and in our coffee rooms. The story is remarkably accurate and balanced, displaying a very deep understanding of the issues in Israel today. I recommend reading the article immediately.</p>
<p>Imagine a spectrum of religious fundamentalism in the orthodox Jewish community. On one end you have extreme Haredi sects and on the other end you have completely secular Israelis. On most things and for most of time the people in the middle, let&#8217;s call them modern orthodox, skewed their allegiences toward the Haredi side. Orthodoxy is the great uniter. The assumption is that any two orthodox people will have more common interests than an orthodox and a secular Jew. This is how things were.<span id="more-7442"></span></p>
<p>In essence, the article argues that while naturally aligned with their fellow orthodox Jews, women from the modern orthodox community in Israel are finding themselves aligned with secular feminist Jews in Israel. The collective pain that is felt due to the oppressiveness toward women in the extreme and not so extreme Haredi world is taking a toll. Women have been attacked physically, verbally, and psychologically for a long time and it is starting to create a negative reaction.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7443" alt="article_inset_lithwick_2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/article_inset_lithwick_2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Several times the article mentions signs that tell women how to dress. We have become accustomed to these signs. But the women in the article argue that the signs give license to thugs who want to make a statement to women. To them, the signs mean much more than &#8220;Please be sensitive to our religious beliefs.&#8221; Part of that is because these standards are entering the public sphere and are no longer just limited to the private insular neighborhoods. But the other part of it is that the signs are somehow justifying the negativity and violence toward women.</p>
<p>What has happened is that women who feel hurt and abused are turning to secular and Reform Jews for salvation. Feminism is a dirty word in many orthodox communities, even in some places within the modern orthodox community. But it&#8217;s becoming a necessary evil for modern orthodox women who are not feminists at all to ask for help from feminists. It&#8217;s odd when orthodox people are funding they have more in common with secular and very liberal Jews than fellow orthodox Jews. But that is what is happening.</p>
<p>The article also talks about modern orthodox women who sympathize with the Women of the Wall. I wish they would be more vocal but i was heartened to hear it.</p>
<p>Last week I wrote about finding common ground and room for dialogue between modern orthodox and yeshivish Jews in America. (See:<br />
<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/08/02/maybe-rabbi-birnbaum-has-a-point-a-solution/">Maybe Rabbi Birnbaum Has a Point: A Solution</a>) I think what we are seeing in the article in TNR is what will happen if we can&#8217;t work together. If the people in the middle start to feel like the liberal and secular Jews are more sympathetic to their way of life, the great split that has been predicted for years, will finally happen. Modern orthodox Judaism will become an independent group.</p>
<p>Some might say, what&#8217;s so bad about that? Well there are plenty negative consequences to mention. But I will mention the two biggest issues. First, the Haredi institutions will fall without modern orthodox support. Some might say that&#8217;s not so bad either. I disagree. Their services are necessary, as is their trap door into engagement with society. On the other side, without a connection the Haredi community, the modern orthodox community will be hard pressed to support its own institutions for lack of qualified teachers and rabbis.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not in our best interests to see a formal split. It might happen in Israel and it might happen in America. I think we should do everything we can to prevent it. The first thing we need to do, is get together and talk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7062" alt="174928094" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a>MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is ruffling the feathers of many charedi Gedolim in Israel and America. It seems there are two levels to the rhetoric against MK Lipman.</p>
<p>Primarily, I think many have a problem with him by dint of his association with MK Yair Lapid. It is an article of faith that Lapid is anti-charedi and since MK Lipman is a member of MK Lapid&#8217;s party he is guilty by association. I don&#8217;t think it would be possible to support Yesh Atid and have charedi approval.</p>
<p>Secondarily, many have a problem with MK Lipman&#8217;s positions. I think that his positions are perceived as anti-charedi and therefore anti-Torah. In particular, supporting a requirement that save for specific instances, all charedim participate in the army or national service and join the workforce instead of a blanket exemption for all charedim from service. MK Lipman also supports requiring a basic secular education for all Israelis, no exceptions. By the way, he also supports a better Jewish education for all Israelis, no exceptions.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care to discuss whether charedim are truly the most authentic orthodox Jews or whether they are corrupting Judaism. That&#8217;s a discussion for another time. I want to discuss the reaction of American charedim to MK Lipman&#8217;s proposals.<span id="more-7060"></span></p>
<p>In Israel, a charedi is identified by several social and religious markers. I list them here in no particular order, nor is this list exhaustive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Manner of dress. Charedim wear black and white, sport felt or fur hats, and shun modern style of dress like jeans or T-shirts.</li>
<li>Fear of God. Charedim place God and religion above all else. The word of God is supreme.</li>
<li>Daas Torah. Charedim extend their fealty to the word of God beyond the words of the Written Torah, and even beyond the Oral Law, to include the words of the great rabbis and treat their words like the word of God.</li>
<li>Torah learning is the ultimate service of God. Working for a living is not ideal at best and is actively avoided at worst.</li>
<li>No secular education. Charedim send their children to private schools which do not teach anything that is not found in the Torah.</li>
<li>Rejection of Zionism. The State of Israel is not recognized as a positive development for the Jewish people. It is more likely described as a problem than a solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is your Israeli Charedi checklist.</p>
<p>However in America, people who consider themselves charedi use a different set of parameters.</p>
<p>I think that American charedim subscribe to 1-3, but not necessarily 4-6. The only people in America who truly hold of 4-6 would be chasidim and not all chasidim would agree with 4-6 either. Certainly, many chasidim do not agree with #4 and in America even the chasidic communities are required to give a basic (not sufficient) secular education.</p>
<p>Why does all of this matter?</p>
<p>It seems to me, that American charedim are more similar to MK Lipman than they are to Israeli charedim. It is conceivable that MK Lipman could word his platform a little bit differently and still mean the exact same thing. He could say &#8220;I want Israeli charedim to be like American charedim&#8221; and the practical ramifications would be strikingly similar.</p>
<p>I think MK Lipman would be thrilled if Israeli charedim were like Lakewood charedim. They get a secular education, they work (eventually), they even support the State of Israel to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Yet, American gedolim and charedim in America continue to malign MK Lipman and his platform. I don&#8217;t get it. All he is saying is that Israeli charedim should be more like American charedim! He wants them to be like us! They should be flattered. Not insulted!</p>
<p>R&#8217; Ahron Feldman is a Rosh Yeshiva of a yeshiva that is precisely what MK Lipman wants for Israeli charedim and yet he severely criticizes MK Lipman going so far as to call him a rasha. It doesn&#8217;t add up. If what we have in America is good why is it not good for our brothers and sisters in Israel? And even if what they have could be conceived of as better, it&#8217;s not so terrible to be like the American charedim, is it?</p>
<p>True, the two groups share one name &#8211; Charedim. But they are different types of charedim!</p>
<p>The situation in Israel is complicated. Army service can be difficult for charedim. We can understand the reluctance to become less insular and take time away from Torah study. These are reasonable critiques of the sweeping proposals being discussed right now. But let&#8217;s be reasonable. We can talk about the issues and figure out the best way to deal with them.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge that there are some potential problems with MK Lipman&#8217;s plan. It&#8217;s not easy to just throw away the old system. There are going to be complications. But I think we will be far more successful if we work together. The plan is not to turn charedim into secular Zi0nists. How about just acting more like American charedim? Seems to me that it should be a workable solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Haredi-Secular.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6127" title="Haredi-Secular" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Haredi-Secular-300x160.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="160" /></a>This week&#8217;s Time Magazine features a cover story on Jerusalem. Although, it is not an article about the BBC pretending that Jerusalem is not the capital of Israel, nor is it an article about East Jerusalem Arabs trying to attain Israeli citizenship. The article is about the cultural war and the turf war between secular Jews and ultra-orthodox / charedi Jews in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The focus of the article is on one &#8220;mixed&#8221; neighborhood where the charedi presence has significantly increased as the secular presence has decreased. Although the article is talking about a few individuals, the behavior described in the article can best be described as juvenile. Both sides have their villains, and in their attempt to gain control over the neighborhood both sides play pranks, vandalize, intimidate, and in general refuse to communicate.<span id="more-6124"></span></p>
<p>Sure, the article makes some technical mistakes and some incorrect assumptions, but I don&#8217;t really care about that. What I do care about is how the sad truth that in today&#8217;s society some Jews can&#8217;t figure out how to get along with each other unless the other person is just like them. That story is a story being repeated over and over again in many communities around the world.</p>
<p>Our schools and shuls are becoming more and more monolithic, our attitude toward the outside is becoming less and less tolerant, and what we are willing to do and sacrifice is becoming greater and greater for the sake of insularity. I find this trend disturbing on many levels. But the situation in Israel demonstrates to a certain degree the logical conclusion to this cycle.</p>
<p>It is a very sad state of affairs when we cannot even live happily amongst Jews. I don&#8217;t excuse the secular guerrilla warfare exposed in Time Magazine such as cutting eruv wires or slapping nude posters on synagogue walls. That is disgraceful behavior. But I also don&#8217;t excuse bullying people out of their homes or enforcing tznius standards on non-religious people.</p>
<p>If all the energy that is being used to outsmart and outwit the other side was used to figuring out how to live together, all the problems would certainly be solved. But it&#8217;s not even an option anymore. The baseline standard is to live apart from one another. I find this very sad.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that Time Magazine is a particularly good venue for this discussion, but it is a discussion that must take place. Is the goal to have a city like Jerusalem completely charedi? Is that what we are striving for? Is that what God wants from us? Will that city be a place that we can all be proud of? Is it moral to impose our religious standards on others?</p>
<p>Honestly, I can&#8217;t answer those questions with any sense of certainty. But those who are answering those questions with certainty, and are trying take control of Jerusalem or any other place in a similar situation, need to have satisfactory answers to those questions. If there is anything that this long dark exile has taught us, it is that being a minority can be very difficult. Especially when the ruling class has ideological differences with the minority. But have we only learned how to be an oppressive majority? Or are we capable of running a free, open society where orthodox Judaism can thrive alongside other ways of life?</p>
<p>I fear that the orthodox Jews who want to create orthodox Jewish cities are struggling with this. We know how to survive very well when others are in charge. Can we meet the challenge of autonomy without creating the same problems for others that we suffered throughout this exile?</p>
<p>I understand that the fear of charedi rule is mostly a fear of extremists. But the extremists are no longer so extreme. The basic standards of life in the charedi world may have been considered extreme 40 or 50 years ago. But now they are standards. Clearly, things are moving in a certain direction. The voice of moderation needs to be heard and the extremists must be silenced. If we do that, we have a chance at creating a united Jerusalem and other other towns, villages and cities as well, that are dominantly charedi but welcoming to all.</p>
<p>If we fail, I can foresee a time where non-charedim, like regular American orthodox Jews, won&#8217;t be welcome in our holiest of places because of our more moderate standards. Imagine waiting 2000 years to return to Jerusalem, only to be denied by our own brothers (and sisters). That would be a tragedy that we must avert.</p>
<p>Thank you Time Magazine for starting the conversation.</p>

They have done so without fear of condemnation or retribution from the religiously adjacent charedi community. This recent wave of violence is not new nor is it shocking or surprising.</p>
<p>Spitting on young girls, calling women whores, forcing segregation at bus stops and on buses are all acts cut from the same cloth as the violence at Manny&#8217;s Bookshop and a political beating in Meah Shearim. We&#8217;ve known about this for a while. Nobody has said a word.</p>
<p>However, this time the media found out about it. So now it&#8217;s national and international news.</p>
<p>This has prompted responses and condemnations from rabbis, rabbinic authorities and lay people. That&#8217;s great. Finally. The problem is that these condemnations are so weak, hedged and long-winded that they, in my opinion, are a failure.</p>
<p>There is only one way to condemn violence and abuse towards women. That would be something like this:<span id="more-4987"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>We strongly condemn any and all violence towards women under any and all circumstances. Those who commit such acts of violence will feel the full effect and power of the religious and secular court system. They will be excommunicated from all religious circles and are heretofore to be considered persona non grata. If you know of any individuals who have abused anyone, whether verbally or physically notify the police and rabbinic leadership immediately.</strong></p>
<p>What we don&#8217;t need is an explanation of how these people are not &#8220;real charedim&#8221;. We don&#8217;t need poetry on the majesty of tznius. We don&#8217;t need snide remarks about the secular media. Just speak out against violence, promise retribution and to take action.</p>
<p>Enough with the apologetics and handwringing.</p>
<p><em>Feel free to copy and paste my version of an appropriate condemnation on all the blogs and news sites that have published the watered down condemnations to this point. If you can, please credit this blog. Thanks.</em></p>
