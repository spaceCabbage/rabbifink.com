				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>One of the more original Orthodox Jewish thinkers is Rabbi David Fohrman. <a href="http://alephbeta.org/" target="_blank">On his excellent website</a>, Rabbi Fohrman teaches his brand of inspiring, intellectual Torah. Every week, Rabbi Fohrman teaches a parsha class with animations. The Torah classes are clever and original ideas that are very often based on Midrashic interpretations and careful reading of the text of the Chumash. In a way, I find his approach similar in form to Rabbi Matis Weinberg in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1892984016/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1892984016&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank">Frameworks</a>, which I love. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/16/book-review-the-queen-you-thought-you-knew/" target="_blank">I did a review of Rabbi Forhman&#8217;s book on Purim</a>. It follows the same format.)</p>
<p>Here is Rabbi Forhman on Vayechi:<span id="more-7955"></span></p>
<p><iframe name="wistia_embed" src="http://fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/igb4ns141p" height="331" width="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>His basic idea is great. Joseph believes he is a dispossessed son. Pharaoh becomes like a father figure to him. Jacob is never sure that Joseph really considers him to be his true father until a key moment on his death bed. This explains the Midrash that says that the descendants of Canaan and Ishmael, two more dispossessed sons came to wage war with Jacob&#8217;s sons as they traveled to Canaan to bury Jacob but stopped when they saw &#8220;one of their own&#8221;, Joseph honoring Jacob.</p>
<p>Nice idea. He does a better job explaining it and fitting it all together than I do. It&#8217;s worth watching.</p>
<p>In response to this video, Rabbi Forhman received the following note:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Rabbi Fohrman’s Parsah thoughts are brilliant &amp; insightful. I just wonder are there any sources for his theories and if yes why do you not quote them?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thank you so much…”</em></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hebrew-text-bible-3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7957" alt="One Line Of Torah" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/hebrew-text-bible-3-600x399.jpg" /></a>This inquiry touched on such a fundamental point that Rabbi Fohrman wrote a blog post to respond to this question. I think <a href="http://www.alephbeta.org/blog/great-dvar-torah-but-what-are-your-sources/" target="_blank">the response</a> was at least as brilliant as the Dvar Torah on Vayechi and illuminates a very important principle in desperate need of clarification.</p>
<p>Here is my summary and explanation of his response:</p>
<p>There is a tradition that later authorities cannot contradict earlier authorities in the study of Talmud. Some people attribute this to a spiritual divide between generations. This idea appears to be in the spirit of &#8220;if we are humans they are angels and if they are humans we are donkeys&#8221;. However this conflates two separate things. The real reason later authorities do not contradict earlier authorities has little to do with spiritual prowess and everything to do with legal precedent. Talmud study is a study of law and law relies on precedent. It&#8217;s possible to overturn precedent. But great deference is given to previously held legal rulings and for good reason. It&#8217;s just more practical that way. Imagine if every generation of Jews rejected the ideas of the previous generation. Judaism would be unrecognizable in 5 minutes. So with regard to halachic matters, precedent matters.</p>
<p>However, when we are dealing in non-legal matters, we are no longer concerned with precedent. It is in this arena that we are given much greater creative license. In non-halachic matters we are not concerned with authority. We learn the text, we learn some commentaries, and we use our intellect and personality to decipher the text and commentaries. This is all fair game. This where Rabbi Fohrman operates.</p>
<p>Further, this is really just interpretation of a text. As long as it makes sense in the words it can be said that it is what the words are saying. So while the creative interpretation may have been expressed by the one reading the text, in essence the idea is really found in the text. It&#8217;s not relevant whether this was the intent of the Author. What matters is that this is what the words say to a particular reader and the interpretation can be reconciled with the rest of the text.</p>
<p>Finally, Rabbi Forhman recommends <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9657108578/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9657108578&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank">Learning to Read Midrash</a>. I have not read this book, but under his recommendation, I will endeavor to add this to my reading list.</p>
<p>This is all quite significant. There is an ongoing debate about whether there is &#8220;psak&#8221; with regard to Hashkafa. Can we state that certain ideas or philosophies that are not prohibited by Jewish law are effectively out of bounds because certain rabbis rejected those ideas? Using the reasoning proposed by Rabbi Fohrman I think we can say that there is no psak in hashkafa. I think we can also say that there is no real reason to establish specific interpretations on Chumash as the &#8220;right&#8221; interpretations or give special privileges to popular interpretations or commentaries.</p>
<p>We are supposed to read the text and learn it. It&#8217;s not enough to review the same familiar commentaries. The idea is to challenge ourselves to find the interpretations that make sense to us and sometimes those might even be original ideas.</p>
<p>One final thought. I think we do a great service to Torah Judaism if we expand the limits of acceptable interpretations on Chumash. The more ideas we allow, the more flavors and varieties of thinking will flourish. This is a good thing. A more narrow view of what is acceptable in terms of non-halachic matters can have negative consequences. It would be wise to seek to avoid those consequences. I support Rabbi Forhman&#8217;s approach. I think it&#8217;s a good thing. More importantly, I think it&#8217;s the right thing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The term Rationalist Judaism has been clanking around the Internet and Orthodox Jewish conversation for a while now. It’s not quite a movement, but there are some very strong contemporary voices behind Rationalist Judaism. Many people think the term is an oxymoron. Others think it is intellectually dishonest. Yet others think it is heresy. But without a working definition or at least a framework to understand what we are talking about, any conversation about Rationalist Judaism will result in people talking past one another and miscommunication.<span id="more-7938"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7939" alt="Thinking-Man-Rodin" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin-600x381.jpg" /></a>First, to address the complaint that calling one brand of Judaism “Rationalist” is insulting or offensive to everyone else. It sure seems like the term is implying that everyone else is irrational. This is not the correct implication. Rationalist Judaism is not to the exclusion of irrationality. Instead it is to exclusion of supernaturalism. That’s not to say that mysticism is inherently irrational either. Maybe it is for some. These are just the words that are used to describe two different approaches to God and Judaism. Words are often cumbersome and imprecise. That is the case here. We don’t mean to say Rationalist Judaism is rational and everyone else is irrational.</p>
<p>In general, rationalism literally means to use reason above all else. In this view, truth can be deduced and is not subject to fallacies like appeals to authority or <em>argumentum ad populum</em>. Obviously, a religious person maintains some belief in authority and relies on some subjective baseline truths that cannot be logically argued. But we are not talking about pure rationalism. We are talking about Rationalist Judaism.</p>
<p>I believe that term Rationalist Judaism was adapted from the term Theistic Rationalism. Both groups share some common principles. The basic idea of both groups is to release theology from supernaturalism and focus on morality. To the extent that supernaturalism can be justifiably removed from religion, Rationalist Judaism holds it should be removed. That is all Rationalist Judaism really means.</p>
<p>There are several heroes and champions of this concept, none greater than Rambam. In his halachic and philosophical works, Rambam sought to eliminate superstition, mysticism, and supernaturalism from Judaism to the greatest extent possible. One overriding theme of his works is that there is nothing supernatural other than God. Giving power to charms, incantations, or even angels is akin to idol worship. He held that belief in God was logical. He held that prophecy was a natural result of perfection. He held that God rarely intervenes with nature. He held that <em>Mitzvos</em> have material benefits for the person who performs the Mitzvah. He held that astrology was bunk. He held that God conformed the Torah to the needs of mankind. He held that <em>Maaseh Breishis</em> was science. He held that <em>Maaseh </em><em>Merkava</em>h was metaphysics. There is not a single mystical idea mentioned in any of his books. It’s as if there is no such thing as mysticism in Rambam’s universe.</p>
<p>Some have tried to argue that Rambam was a mystic and obscured his true views. This has been thoroughly debunked by many great scholars and if you are of this mind, I direct you to this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906764158" target="_blank">Maimonides’ Confrontation with Mysticism</a></p>
<p>There are many other examples of great Torah authorities who used similar principles in their halachic, or philosophical, or exegetical works. R’ Samson Raphael Hirsch wrote Horeb, a book of the philosophy of <em>mitzvos</em> without a single kabbalistic reference. The entire book makes sense of Torah Judaism and it all works even if one rejects mysticism.</p>
<p>Ralbag is another. His commentary on Chumash literally reinterprets examples of supernatural events into metaphors or visions instead of real life occurrences. His worldview fit this same broad category. To the extent that supernaturalism could be excised from Torah and Judaism, he saw to it that they were.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Rationalist Judaism. It’s a tradition that has a long and powerful chain of great Torah luminaries who lived by this philosophy.</p>
<p>Another important element of Rationalist Judaism is that because God’s intervention and communication with man is so limited, the Mesorah and Holy texts of Judaism are more subject to error than one who believes that God ensures the truth of everything. In the opposing view, God’s essence permeates the writings of men like the great Talmudic scholars known as Chazal. Thus, their writings are presumed to be free of mistakes or misjudgments. Rationalist Judaism holds that the best efforts of man can still result in error. This is especially true in matters that are not Torah specific. We refer here to math, science, history, medicine, and other disciplines not directly related to Torah. However, even if Chazal were to err in issues of halacha or Torah specific interpretation, it would not matter as they have the authority to establish the laws for the Jewish people.</p>
<p>It’s true that this sort of thinking led many people to conclusions that we would reject today. Rambam himself was of the belief that God’s existence is provable. Rambam also thought Aristotelian philosophy and science were as true as God’s word in the Torah. We know that both of these are actually untrue. Does this mean that Rationalist Judaism is wrong? Of course not.</p>
<p>In fact, only someone whose paradigm is that Torah authorities are infallible would argue that by disproving Aristotle the entire worldview of Rambam is incorrect. But the paradigm of Rationalist Judaism does not allow for this sort of thinking. People do err, only God is infallible. So Rambam dealt with truth in the same way Chazal dealt with truth. That is, they were subject to the thinking and common beliefs of their time. We are also subject to the thinking and common beliefs of our time. Therefore, we are also supposed to look at Torah through the prism of modern thinking. No one actually pretends that Rambam was a Modern Orthodox Jew of 2013 America. But his worldview is one that allows, or even requires, using contemporary thinking to build one’s Jewish life. That’s what Chazal did and that is what Rambam did and that is what we are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Rambam is not making the claim that Chazal and the prophets before them lived and believed the same way he believed. Rather he is making the argument that with the same information available to Rambam they would have drawn the same conclusions as Rambam. Further, he demonstrates that so much of what they did say is compatible with his Aristotelian, Islamic influenced philosophy. However, even if they would have not reached the same conclusions, they would have used all the available information and evidence to formulate their views. That is what Rationalist Judaism attempts to do as it has always attempted to do.</p>
<p>But what’s the point of all this? Isn’t it obvious that there are supernatural forces and that Judaism believes in mysticism?</p>
<p>The answer to this very serious question is that Rambam held that these were all corruptions. In his view, true Judaism does not have any of the trappings of a supernaturalist cult. God is supernatural, a few miracles that were necessary for the birth of our nation occurred in Biblical times, but other than that, Judaism is a religion that is supposed to be hyper-focused on the practical matters of personal growth and emulating God in our lives.</p>
<p>Sure, many great people introduced mystical or supernatural elements into Judaism. Most people believe in them too. But in Rambam’s view, these are human additions and emendations. They are not integral to serving God, and may in fact harm our service of God.</p>
<p>For someone who believes in the supernatural and mystical this all sounds crazy. That’s fine. However, not everyone is predisposed to believing in things that they can’t see or prove. Those people may still be willing to suspend their disbelief or skepticism and believe in God or even in Divine Revelation. However, if they are not required to believe in mysticism and its trappings of Zoharic and Lurianic kabbalism, the ties to astrology, the use of charms and <em>segulos</em>, the existence of demons, the belief that human beings can be infallible, the idea that Chazal had access to modern science (but didn’t tell everyone about penicillin), that God still communicates with humans (but only to Orthodox Jews), and many other beliefs that require active supernaturalism and a healthy dose of non-skepticism, then why should they believe in those things? Further, if they were required to believe in these things, would it surprise us if they rejected the entire package? No, it would not. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/16/judaism-of-the-future-my-response-to-klal-perspectives-spring-2012/" target="_blank">Judaism of the Future: My Response to Klal Perspectives Spring 2012</a>)</p>
<p>Rationalist Judaism is a real thing. It’s not a fantasy. It’s not a boogeyman that seeks to demonize those who believe in supernatural Judaism. It’s an alternative for people who are more skeptical. It’s a way of serving God without being forced to believe in an entire universe that stretches beyond what is acceptable in their view. There are other side benefits to this perspective. Some of them have already been discussed on this and other blogs. One of those benefits will be the subject of a future post.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that one can practice Orthodox Judaism and love God and make a Kiddush Hashem without mysticism. It still works. Perhaps it even works better. But no matter how one practices their Judaism, it is wise to establish both views as viable options. In this way, we can ensure that the personality types that are drawn to mysticism and skepticism have a place in Orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>In Parshas Vayigash, Yosef finally reveals his identity to his brothers. It was quite shocking to them to discover the truth about their brother. While it&#8217;s clear that Yosef told his brothers his identity directly, there is a legend that explains how his father Yaakov learned the truth. It is cited, in an odd way, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00071NC2K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00071NC2K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank">The Little Midrash Says</a>:<span id="more-7926"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/harp-hands-toned.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7927" alt="harp-hands-toned" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/harp-hands-toned.jpg" /></a>&#8220;Do you know which messenger was the first to bring Yaakov the news that his son Yosef was still alive?<br />
</em><em>You may have heard (that&#8217;s the odd part &#8211; ef) that is was Yaakov&#8217;s granddaughter Serach, the daughter of Asher.<br />
</em><em>The brothers picked her because they needed a smart messenger for the news. Even though it would be marvelous for Yaakov to find out the news that his son Yosef was still alive, the sudden shock of such unexpected news might do harm to Yaakov&#8217;s health. You must remember that Yaakov was an old man, 130 years old. And Yosef had been missing for 22 years!<br />
</em><em>Therefore the brothers picked Serach whom they knew to be a smart girl and who played the harp beautifully.<br />
</em><em>Serach began to play music for her grandfather and softly hummed the words, &#8220;My uncle Yosef is still alive. He is a ruler over Egypt.&#8221; She repeated these words over and over until her grandfather began to smile.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Of course I am generalizing, but pretty much everyone who attended an Orthodox Day School or Yeshiva knows this story. But there&#8217;s a serious problem with this tale.</p>
<p>There is a hierarchy of Midrashim. Whether we take Midrash literally or metaphorically or some other way, Midrashim are taken seriously because they are the interpretations of our great sages. A few Midrashic texts can be dated to the period of the Talmud. Others came along later. The earlier a Midrash was written, the more gravitas its interpretations carry.</p>
<p>Here is the earliest and only source I could find for the story as it is retold in The Little Midrash Says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>91v And they came unto the borders of the land, and they said to each other, What shall we do in this matter before our father, for if we come suddenly to him and tell him the matter, he will be greatly alarmed at our words and will not believe us.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>92v And they went along until they came nigh unto their houses, and they found Serach, the daughter of Asher, going forth to meet them, and the damsel was very good and subtle, and knew how to play upon the harp.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>93v And they called unto her and she came before them, and she kissed them, and they took her and gave unto her a harp, saying, Go now before our father, and sit before him, and strike upon the harp, and speak these words.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>94v And they commanded her to go to their house, and she took the harp and hastened before them, and she came and sat near Jacob.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>95v And she played well and sang, and uttered in the sweetness of her words, Joseph my uncle is living, and he ruleth throughout the land of Egypt, and is not dead.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>96v And she continued to repeat and utter these words, and Jacob heard her words and they were agreeable to him.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>97v He listened whilst she repeated them twice and thrice, and joy entered the heart of Jacob at the sweetness of her words, and the spirit of God was upon him, and he knew all her words to be true.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>98v And Jacob blessed Serach when she spoke these words before him, and he said unto her, My daughter, may death never prevail over thee, for thou hast revived my spirit; only speak yet before me as thou hast spoken, for thou hast gladdened me with all thy words.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>99v And she continued to sing these words, and Jacob listened and it pleased him, and he rejoiced, and the spirit of God was upon him.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t claim to be an expert researcher, but my amateur research has led me to precisely this one source for the legend of Serach and her harp and this is it. The source is from a book called &#8220;Sefer HaYashar.&#8221; But this is not the famous Sefer HaYashar written by Rabbeinu Tam. This is a much later work of aggadic interpretations on the Bible. The earliest date of publication is 1625 and it was passed off as an ancient book with a similar storyline as the Zohar. That is, it was claimed to have been written during the destruction of the Second Temple (around 70 CE), hidden for generations, and later &#8220;found&#8221; in 1552. The earliest it was written was early 16th century.</p>
<p>It is in the context of this book and the Zohar that Leon Modena famously and boldly called them both forgeries.</p>
<p>The book is full of fantastic legends that would never be considered &#8220;Torah True™&#8221; in frum circles. I don&#8217;t think there are any frum rabbis or laypeople that takes this book as a serious book of Torah. Yet, the legend of Serach and her harp lives on.</p>
<p>I may have somewhat of an explanation for this quirk of &#8220;Mesora™&#8221;.</p>
<p>Serach bas Asher is the subject of another Midrash that relates to Vayigash. The verse counts 66 members of Yaakov&#8217;s family who went down to Egpyt. Then the verse says they were 70. Everyone and their mother tries to reconcile these verses. Yosef and his two sons make 69 but the 70th is a matter of great dispute. Some Christians say the 70th was Jesus. The most well known answers in the Torah community come from the Talmud and early Midrashim. Some say it was Yocheved who was born at the gates of Egpyt. Others say God counted as number 70. Other answers abound. The Pesikta d&#8217;Rav Kahane, a very very old Midrash, says the 70th was Serach bas Asher. Yalkut Shimoni, a later Midrash corroborates the interpretation of the Pesikta d&#8217;Rav Kahane. Thus, we have a very reputable source with a Midrash regarding Serach bas Asher in another context in our parsha. It&#8217;s possible that because we had the one accepted source that already includes Serach in the Midrashic narrative of the parsha, it was an easy jump to subsume the Sefer HaYashar&#8217;s legend into the narrative as well.</p>
<p>The only thing these old Midrashic sources say about Serach is that she could be number 70. A much later Midrash called the Midrash HaGadol, of obscure authorship from the 14th century, is the most oft cited source on the Internet for the legend of Serach and her harp. This too is an error. The Midrash HaGadol only says that Serach was asked by her uncles to hint to Yaakov that Yosef was alive so that he wouldn&#8217;t be too shocked when he saw the wagons that Yosef had sent. So, the story goes,  she waited until Yaakov was praying and then she &#8220;wondered&#8221; aloud if her Uncle Yosef was alive and if he had two sons named Ephraim and Menashe. When Yaakov finished praying he saw the wagons that Yosef had sent and he understood that Yosef was still alive. He didn&#8217;t go into shock because he had heard Serach &#8220;wondering&#8221; about Yosef and his sons.</p>
<p>There is no harp in this telling of the story. Therefore it is incorrect to cite the Midrash HaGadol as the source for the legend of Serach and her harp. Further, we do not usually accept aggadic interpretations invented by Medieval commentators in the same way we accept Talmudic aggadic interpretations.</p>
<p>EDIT: I was alerted to the Targum Yonasan (unknown authorship and date, likely around the same time as Midrash HaGadol or later) who says that Serach told Yaakov that Yosef was alive. That&#8217;s all he says. No descriptions as to how she told him.</p>
<p>So we have no early sources that mention Serach at all with regard to telling Yaakov that Yosef is alive. We have one very late, somewhat reliable Torah source that says that Serach hinted it to Yaakov while he prayed. And we have one weak source that tells the story the way it is cited in The Little Midrash Says replete with the singing and the harp.</p>
<p>As a matter of history, it&#8217;s certainly possible that the author of Sefer HaYashar knew of the Serach legend as it was told by the Midrash HaGadol, but it is extremely unlikely. The Midrash HaGadol was not known outside of Yemen until the 19th century when it was first published. This also further clouds the issue of whether it is a Torah True™ part of the Mesorah™. Because it was not part of the non-Yemenite Mesorah™ until the 19th century, it might not have gained notoriety and reputability thus it could be considered a weak source. Alternatively, some claim that Midrash HaGadol brings to light many aggadic interpretations that were well known but forgotten over the centuries, so perhaps the story of Serach hinting to Yaakov that Yosef was alive while he prayed has an earlier source that has been lost. Also, assuming the author of Sefer HaYashar did in fact know of the version in Midrash HaGadol, he changed it to include the version with singing and a harp.</p>
<p>This is a summary of my research. Obviously, I could be mistaken about everything I have written. Barring the discovery of serious egregious errors, I think we have to question whether the legend of Serach and her harp should be a basic part of the way we teach and learn Vayigash.</p>
<p>Sources I used: Jewish Encyclopedia, Google, Toras Shleimah, Wikipedia (double-checking citations), and the original texts of Sefer HaYashar, Midrash HaGadol, Pesikta d&#8217;Rav Kahane, Yalkut Shimoni and others.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Ralbag or Gershonides is famously rationalist and shuns all mystical interpretations in his commentary on the Chumash. Sometimes it seems impossible to avoid a mystical interpretation. One such section in the Chumash is the wrestling match between Jacob and the <em>sar</em> (minister) of Esau. They wrestle all night, Jacob is victorious, the <em>sar</em> says he needs to be on his way, Jacob asks for a blessing, he is blessed with the name Israel, and due to Jacob&#8217;s leg injury we do not eat the sciatic nerve.<span id="more-7853"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/breenbergh_bartholomeus-jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7854" alt="breenbergh_bartholomeus-jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/breenbergh_bartholomeus-jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel-600x437.jpg" /></a>Traditionally, the <em>sar</em> is interpreted as a heavenly angel who represents the spiritual side of Esau. I&#8217;ve always had a problem with this, my limited knowledge of angels notwithstanding, because I don&#8217;t understand why Esau has an angel who corresponds to his flesh and blood self. Do we all have corresponding angels? If not, why is Esau special? But I digress. Ralbag will have none of it. He does not subscribe to the view that angels exist. So what happened?</p>
<p>A couple of years ago <a href="Hakirah.org" target="_blank">Hakirah</a> published an excellent article on Ralbag by Yitzhak Grossman. The article is a broad overview of Ralbag and provides a fairly thorough depiction of Ralbag. One section of the article is about how Ralbag would allegorize passages that could not be understood simply in his worldview. The primary example is the story of Jacob wrestling.</p>
<p>In short, he says the whole thing was a prophetic vision, a dream. There was no physical battle. There is no actual heavenly minister of Esau. Rather, Jacob was concerned about his upcoming battle and we know that what one thinks about will have an influence on their dreams. So Jacob dreamed the whole thing.</p>
<p>But how did he injure his leg in a dream? There is no reason to think Jacob did not actually injure his leg because the Torah prohibits us from eating the sciatic nerve based on the incident. Jacob&#8217;s leg must have been injured. But how? Ralbag gives two answers.</p>
<p>1. Sometimes a dream can feel real. It can activate our bodies in a way that causes a physical action despite the fact that what we are seeing or experiencing is not real. He mentions nocturnal emissions as an example. The person&#8217;s body reacts to the thoughts in the person&#8217;s dream. Sometimes we dream that we are jumping or running and it will cause our leg to suddenly move. We&#8217;ve all experienced this at some point.</p>
<p>Jacob was having an extremely visceral dream. When he saw his leg injury in his dream it caused him to move his leg in a way that caused him to severely injure himself. When we woke up, he was limping.</p>
<p>2. Sometimes we dream about the things that are happening to us during our sleep. If you are cold, you might dream about being in a cold place. If a man is aroused, he might dream he is with a woman. Our physical condition during our sleep can affect our dreams.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s possible that Jacob dreamt about his leg becoming dislocated in a wrestling match with Esau&#8217;s heavenly angel because while he was moving his family and transporting his possessions across the river he actually hurt his leg. That night he dreamed about his aching leg and spiritual meaning became attached to it.</p>
<p>Pretty creative and pretty interesting, if you ask me.</p>
<p>This path of Torah study has been mostly neglected in our current system of Torah learning. We study the other commentaries. The ones who believed in angels and magic are much more popular. That&#8217;s just the way it is. Perhaps we could say this is some sort of &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; Torah and our Mesorah has evolved to focus more on the mystical side of things.</p>
<p>But I wonder how different Orthodox Judaism would look and feel if this Maimonidean version of Judaism had won the day. Would we be better off? Would we be worse off? Would it have any impact at all?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think that the Judaism of the Maimonidean persuasion flourished in a time and place that was not that different than our American Orthodox Judaism. Jews were not subject to violence and pogroms. Jews were protected under the law and by and large were able to live productive lives within the society of the Arab world. Mysticism was certainly found there as well, but mysticism really flourished in the European countries where Jews were living in constant fear for their lives.</p>
<p>Might our social environment be more similar to the Golden Age of Spanish Jewry? Might our world be more conducive to Maimonidean philosophy? I think it&#8217;s very possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A few days ago I spoke with a Satmar chasid who studies academic Biblical Scholarship. We talked for a while and I got a sense of his typical chasidic upbringing, his current life situation, and his scholarship activity.</p>
<p>Like almost everyone raised in a deeply insular chasidic environment, he speaks English as a second language. HIs accent is not as thick as some of the other chasidic people I know, but it&#8217;s clear that Yiddish is his first language. However, once I got past the accent, it was also very clear that this was an extremely bright and erudite young man.</p>
<p>I talk to people all the time. Some are smarter than others. Some people have quicker minds than others. This fellow was smart, no question about it.<span id="more-7818"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://thetorah.com/satmar-hasid-and-a-bible-critic/" target="_blank">He wrote a superb article</a> describing his journey into Bible Scholarship and the various ways it has adjusted his thinking and Jewish experience. It was beautifully written and made its points eloquently and somewhat poetically. I was asked to vouch for his chasidic bona fides, which I did, based on a mutual friend and my assessment following our conversation. (Verifying that the fellow exists and lives in the Chasidic community is not an endorsement or approval of the content of his article.)<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cityside060501_560-600x396.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7819" alt="cityside060501_560-600x396" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/cityside060501_560-600x396.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The article generated a bit of a firestorm. Not because of its provocative content though. The largest issue seemed to be that people could not believe that a chasid could write such an amazing article. Turns out, the article was too good. It was suggested (accused?) that the chasid had written some notes and the editors of TheTorah.com must have rewritten it in proper English. To alleviate the skepticism I asked to see the original draft he submitted to TheTorah.com and I again confirmed that it was at least 98% of his own writing. Only a few minor edits were made and they were use and stylistic edits, not wholesale rewrites.</p>
<p>But the skepticism remained. People were literally saying that a chasid cannot write so well. It&#8217;s impossible they claimed. I was challenged on my Facebook page and TheTorah.com also received extremely skeptical, bordering on accusatory, comments and feedback.</p>
<p>This is pure bigotry. And it disgusts me.</p>
<p>It is absolutely true that a chasid is going to be severely handicapped by his lack of proper secular education. The average chasid starts much further down on the ladder of English erudition. I don&#8217;t dispute that fact. But with some effort, anyone can learn how to write well. And if one has a gift with words, is able to put ideas into black and white in any language, those skills will translate into beautiful English prose and poetry.</p>
<p>While it is fair to say that a chasid will lack teachable skills simply because a chasid is untaught, it is bigoted to assume that a chasid will lack talent and ability.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/07/15/social-issues-raised-by-the-recent-tragedy/" target="_blank">After the Leiby Kletzky tragedy</a>, I paraphrased <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/11/obligatory-ted-williams-post/" target="_blank">Lee Anne Touhy from &#8220;The Blind Side&#8221;</a>. In talking about the inner city ghetto, Touhy said that the cure for cancer might be in those ghettos. We need to give all youth the opportunity to discover it. The same thing applies to the chasidic ghetto. There are plenty of super talented people behind those walls. Some might have the talent to cure cancer, unfortunately few have the opportunity. Some have the talent to write incredible articles or books in English, unfortunately few have the opportunity.</p>
<p>But when someone gets the opportunity, it&#8217;s cause for celebration and recognition. When a chasid breaks free from the artificial wall his community has placed around him and discovers a special talent, we all benefit. And let&#8217;s not be so prejudiced against chasids that we can&#8217;t believe that talent can be found behind those walls. The only real difference between those on the inside and those on the outside is opportunity. But insofar as talent goes, those on the inside are at least as blessed as those on the outside.</p>
<p>To think that a certain group or subgroup is inherently inferior and incapable of achieving greatness is bigotry. Pure and simple. It&#8217;s no different than saying that a black person cannot be president or that a woman cannot be a Supreme Court Justice or that an Asian cannot play basketball or that an Orthodox Jew cannot be a rockstar. There are talented and incredible people everywhere. Some are given an easier path to discovering and sharing that talent, but talent is everywhere.</p>
<p>We should be encouraging talent from the chasidic community to contribute to greater society, and stop being so shocked when they actually do.</p>
<p>One suggestion would be to stop using &#8220;chasidish&#8221; as a pejorative, whether in style of clothing or otherwise. To stop imitating or mocking chasidic people for their accents and foibles. We all know that non-chasids do it. But it contributes to a bigotry that makes it impossible to believe a chasid might be the next Hemingway. Let&#8217;s help make that happen and not stifle their creativity. Let&#8217;s embrace their talent, not question it. I guarantee you that they will continue to impress us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The ongoing conversation about the agunah problem in the wake of the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/05/the-ny-post-agunah-story-is-about-much-more-than-jewish-divorce/" target="_blank">Gital Dodelson article in the NY Post</a> consistently raises one impossibly difficult question. I’ve been asked this question many times and in many different ways. In my opinion, it’s the fundamental issue of the agunah crisis.</p>
<p>The public is justifiably angry with a husband who does not give a get. But the recalcitrant husband has a pretty compelling argument in his favor.<span id="more-7805"></span></p>
<p>The Torah itself gives the husband absolute authority in the matter of the divorce. If this is Torah law then we are forced to say that this is God’s will. If God gave the power of divorce to the man alone, how can it be considered wrong or evil if he does not give his wife a get? And how can we call it an injustice when he does not give a get? Don’t blame the husband, blame the Torah. The Torah is at fault. God is at fault. Change the laws of divorce and the problem will be solved!</p>
<p>Some variant of this question is the crux of the agunah problem. In simple terms, why is the husband a bad guy when he doesn’t give a get if God gave him the power to decide if he wants to give the get? It is a very difficult question for an Orthodox Jew. And now it is being asked over and over again.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/large-9564591.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7807" alt="large-9564591" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/large-9564591.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think I have an answer to this question.</p>
<p>It’s true that in terms of divorce law, the power to divorce vests in the husband and he is the only one who can dissolve a marriage. The husband must willingly give the get. We are stuck with that law. Pure legalistic Torah matters are almost always unassailable. There is almost no way for contemporary rabbinic authorities to change a law derived from the Torah or even established by Chazal. There’s just no acceptable mechanism within Orthodox Judaism to make changes to Torah law.</p>
<p><em>(Rabbinic laws often have loopholes baked into the law, e.g. eruvei chatzeros, eruv tavshilin. Pruzbul and hefker beis din hefker are examples of the rabbis creating a legal fiction that circumvents Torah laws with regard to money, they do not change the actual Torah laws.)</em></p>
<p>The thing is, divorce law is not the only part of the Torah that informs us how to behave in case of divorce. That part of the Torah is will never change. There are other parts of the Torah that do fluctuate and are subject to societal norms and niceties. Ethical and moral laws in the Torah depend on the context. Kindness and virtue largely depend on the subjective expectations of one’s friends and community. Perhaps at one time a certain act or behavior was considered normal and fair. But at a different time it could be considered evil or wrong. Things in this arena are more subjective and they do change. These <em>bein adam l’chaveiro</em> elements of the Torah always apply and I think they are especially important during a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> One is obligated to love his fellow as himself. “That which is hated to you, do not do to others.” Would a husband want his wife to hold him hostage? No. Thus it is prohibited to hold the wife hostage.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> It is prohibited to cause an animal pain. All the more so it is prohibited to cause pain to a fellow human being. Withholding a get causes extreme pain to the estranged wife.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> One who causes emotional damage to another person is obligated to compensate the victim. One cannot act in a way that causes other emotional harm. R’ Elyashiv <em>paskened</em> that sexual abusers were <em>rodfim</em> (pursuers) because of the emotional harm caused by their violence toward their victims. Causing another person emotional harm is a very serious issue and is absolutely against the Torah.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The Torah requires that we help unload the animal of our enemy. Many authorities learn from this that we are required to lend a helping hand to anyone who requires help. Does a wife waiting for her get not require assistance?<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> We are obligated to follow in the merciful ways of God. Is it merciful to withhold a get? Clearly not. A recalcitrant husband violates this mitzvah as well.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Read the prophets. Their words often constitute rabbinic obligations. They admonish us for mistreating the underprivileged. A wife at the mercy of her husband is underprivileged.</p>
<p>The list goes on. There are many interpersonal obligations and prohibitions that are blatantly trampled upon when one withholds a get. I don’t think there is an doubt about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the objective laws of divorce won’t ever change. But the subjective laws of how to treat one’s wife during a divorce are subject to change. Maybe at one time it was not evil to withhold a get. I don&#8217;t understand it, but I accept that it may have been normative behavior at one time in history. But our common sense tells us that today it is amoral to cause this kind of pain to anyone, let alone one’s wife.</p>
<p>Turns out that while the Jewish laws of divorce don’t obligate the husband to give a get and a wife really cannot divorce her husband, by refusing to give a get the husband is violating several other mitzvahs. In other words, if one isolates the get issue as a pure question of Jewish divorce law it’s true that the wife is powerless and seemingly unprotected. But the Torah is not so simple. We don’t isolate civil law from religious law and we don’t sequester civil and religious law from the Torah’s moral and ethical laws. It’s all part of one Torah given by one God. Exploiting a legal loophole does not justify violating ethical laws in the Torah. It’s forbidden to be a jerk. It’s an <em>issur d’orysa</em> in many instances. It does not matter that the Torah gives him the right to be a jerk. It’s still assur.</p>
<p>I think that the original question obfuscates just how terrible it is to withhold a get. It is so obviously a horrible way to act towards a fellow human being. Regardless of whether it is within the husband’s legal right to withhold the get, it is patently clear that by refusing to give a get a husband is in violation of the ethical and moral laws as well as the spirit of the Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The following exchange appears in this week’s edition of HaModia newspaper.</p>
<p><em>“I am occasionally invited to my uncle’s house for Shabbos. Sometimes he has as his guest a friend who was a yeshiva student in his youth, but unfortunately says he does not believe the Torah comes from Hashem. He gets into discussions with me to challenge my emunah with all kinds of philosophical arguments.</em></p>
<p><em>Should I just ignore him, which may make him think that I accept his arguments, or should I read up on how to respond to these challenges?”<span id="more-7742"></span></em></p>
<p>In his answer R’ Abraham J. Twersky advised the reader to inform the guest that he is not interested in these discussions. He then goes on to explain the pathology of the formerly orthodox Jew. <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7744" alt="presidential-debate" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/presidential-debate-600x400.jpeg" /></p>
<p>In his opinion, the real reason anyone leaves orthodox Judaism is because they want to be able to do anything and everything without restrictions. It’s a matter of self-control, not theology. He is blinded by his desires and thus cannot engage in critical thinking.</p>
<p>This answer betrays a deep misunderstanding of the ex-frum community. It’s simply not true that everyone who leaves orthodox Judaism does so because they have no self-control and are incapable of intelligent conversation. It’s an old trope that if one leaves the strictures of orthodox Judaism they are hedonists. In fact, many of them add new restrictions to their lives and go vegetarian, or exercise regularly to the point that it’s a burden, and of course most of them live very humanist lives. Not too many become gangsters or serial philanderers.</p>
<p>What might be a better answer to the question posed by the reader in this column?</p>
<p>I would say that these discussions should be avoided too. But for a completely different reason.</p>
<p>If this formerly orthodox Jew is coming to a Shabbos table, that’s great. We should make it as comfortable and pleasant as possible. We want him to continue coming to Shabbos meals. If we believe that a Shabbos meal is a positive Jewish experience, and we do, we should want this fellow to attend as many Shabbos meals as possible. We don&#8217;t want him to feel threatened, or judged, or uncomfortable. Your job at the meal is to keep him coming. Stay away from divisive issues of religion. Talk about sports, politics, neighborhood hock, the cholent, anything but the things that divide you. Don&#8217;t be divisive.</p>
<p>Be a friend. Be kind. Be a kiddush Hashem. Don’t be the self assured argumentative intellectual advocate for God that you fancy yourself. The chance of changing his mind is close to nil. Put your energies into being a good person, not being a good debater. You will give him the opportunity to engage in more positive Jewish experiences if you behave like a <em>mentch.</em> So be a <em>mentch!</em></p>
<p>If the questions he poses bother you, there are some excellent books that might quench your thirst for answers. If you don’t need answers and you were only going to research the questions to answer the guest, study something you are interesting in learning.</p>
<p>However, if you are not bothered by the questions, ask yourself why that is so, and think about how deep your faith runs. We all should contemplate how we can answer these questions for ourselves, not simply to win over new recruits to our cause. If we can provide positive Jewish experiences for those who have left orthodox Judaism, we are doing a great service to them and we are making a true kiddush Hashem.</p>

<p>Turns out, I made a big mistake and misremembered what the Torah Temimah said. It&#8217;s inexcusable and I regret not double checking what he actually says before I posted. <em>Chatasi.</em> So I wrote a second post correcting my error.</p>

<p>The Torah Temimah lists <em>Damesek</em> as one of many examples where the Torah uses a foreign language in the Torah. He says that the word is used as &#8220;domestic help&#8221; in &#8220;old languages&#8221; and is still used in French in this way.</p>
<p>In the comments, people wonder if this is a big deal. Maybe it&#8217;s not. It definitely shouldn&#8217;t be a big deal but I think it is a big deal. Here is why.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7714" alt="255337-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/255337-1-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p>There are some questions about the Bible that have traditional answers. But some of those traditional answers appear to be insufficient to Orthodox Jews in 5774. Sometimes the questions are better than the answers. One kind of answer that has been presented and rejected by traditionalists is that the Torah speaks in the language of man and may include anachronisms that made sense to the original intended audience in a way that our modern ears can&#8217;t relate.</p>
<p>The reason this approach is rejected is because it breaks some of the self imposed traditional frum rules of learning Torah. It&#8217;s considered too liberal or too reform-like to allow for non-eternal meanings to the Torah.</p>
<p>Two of the arguments used to bolster this claim are that the Torah was a closed book at Sinai and that the Torah cannot be influenced by factors external to the text itself. The commonly held position on the closing of the Bible is that everything was taught at Sinai. Opinions that allow for the final verses (and more) to have been added by later prophets from unimpeachable sources are shunned because they burst this bubble. Similarly, allowing for outside influence into the Torah implies that the Torah is somewhat subjective. For example, the famous statement of Maimonides that sacrifices were a concession to a people with pagan leanings is considered borderline problematic. The conventional wisdom is that if the Torah included sacrifices it must have been God&#8217;s &#8220;original intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Showing that the Torah is a book with external influence bolsters the claim of Maimonides and may allow for extending it to other ideas in the Torah. This is considered dangerous and out of bounds for &#8220;Torah True&#8221; Jews.</p>
<p>Whenever we have traditionally accepted sources that allow for outside influence we are showing that the contemporary reluctance to this kind of interpretation actually runs counter to tradition. The Torah Temimah had no problem listing several places in the Bible where the Torah borrows from other languages. This is a big deal.</p>
<p>Of the two options above, let&#8217;s call them &#8220;closed book&#8221; and &#8220;not completely closed book,&#8221; which fits better with this Torah Temimah? It&#8217;s clearly the &#8220;not completely closed book&#8221; option. In other words, we are reinforcing the idea that the Torah could have outside influences. Why would the Torah use a non-Bible word it its text? It certainly could have used a native word or invented a Biblical word. Why didn&#8217;t it? Isn&#8217;t the obvious answer that the Torah was speaking to an audience familiar with these words and thus it chose to use familiar language?</p>
<p>The implication of that answer is that the Torah considers its audience. It spoke in a way that people would expect it to speak. It&#8217;s an eternal book that was written under specific circumstances. Therefore we are able to extend this theory to answer questions we have with new non-traditional answers. The answers might be new, but the approach is not new. Of course we are not at liberty to change it or ignore its commands, God forbid. But we can understand many of its tenets, rules, and stories in this context.</p>
<p>This might shed light on the Creation Story and the Flood Story. Or not. But I think it should be an option on the table for Orthodox Jews.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>This is an interesting interpretation by the Torah Temimah where he uses scientific knowledge to explain a dispute in the Talmud.</p>
<p>The verse in Parshas Breishis states <em>&#8220;There went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.&#8221;</em> The Torah Temimah quotes the Babylonian Talmud in Mesechta Taanis 9B that records a dispute between R&#8217; Eliezer and R&#8217; Yehoshua regarding the source of rain.<span id="more-7655"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">[Copied from Soncino] &#8220;R. Eliezer said: The whole world draws its water supply from the waters of the ocean, as it is said, But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole of the ground. Thereupon R. Joshua said to him: But are not the waters of the ocean salty? He replied: They are sweetened by the clouds. R. Joshua said: The whole world drinks from the upper waters, as it is said, And drinketh water as the rain of heaven cometh down. If so, what is the force of the verse, ‘But there went up a mist from the earth’? This teaches that the clouds grow in strength as they rise towards the firmament and then open their mouth as a flask and catch the rain water, as it is said, Which distill rain from His vapor, they are perforated like a sieve and they slowly distill waters on the ground.&#8221;<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/evaporation.pdf"><br />

<p>The Torah Temimah explains what R&#8217; Eliezer means using (then) modern science. R&#8217; Yehoshua is correct. The waters of the oceans are salty and unfit for drinking. Therefore R&#8217; Yeshoshua concludes that rain water cannot come from the oceans. R&#8217; Eliezer understood that the reason the waters of the ocean must rise to the clouds and then return to the earth is to desalinize the ocean water. Only the water evaporates while the impurities like salt are left behind.</p>
<p>This can be demonstrated by boiling dirty water says the Torah Temimah. The droplets that form on the lip of the boiling pot are pure water no matter what the water in the pot looks like. Similarly, the salt and minerals in water on earth are removed when the water evaporates and are returned to earth via the clouds in the sky. That&#8217;s why R&#8217; Eliezer says the whole world draws water from the oceans. R&#8217; Yehoshua is confused because the ocean waters are salty. To which R&#8217; Eliezer replies that the waters are sweetened during the evaporation and cloud process just like the droplets on the lid of the pot boiling dirty water.</p>
<p>I read this and thought this was a pretty good explanation of R&#8217; Eliezer&#8217;s position. Unfortunately it leaves R&#8217; Yehoshua in a very vulnerable position. What are we to think happened after R&#8217; Eliezer explained evaporation to R&#8217; Yehoshua? Perhaps when presented with the scientific explanation he acquiesced to R&#8217; Eliezer. The Talmud assumes he did not because the subsequent discussion deals with R&#8217; Yehoshua&#8217;s position as equally viable to R&#8217; Eliezer&#8217;s.</p>
<p>More importantly, could R&#8217; Eliezer have known this scientific information? According to my brief Internet research, it seems that the basic principles of natural desalination were known to the Greeks. It&#8217;s possible that R&#8217; Eliezer adopted something he heard from them. Although I am unsure if they understood that evaporated seawater turned into clouds in the manner the Torah Temimah understands it. Of course, it is possible that R&#8217; Eliezer received this scientific information from God or some Divine Tradition. Personally, I do not subscribe to this view, but many others do.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the correct explanation R&#8217; Eliezer&#8217;s position. It is elegant in its explanation and pretty clever but it leaves us with other unanswered questions. Either way, kudos to the Torah Temimah for using his secular knowledge in his commentary on the Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Tonight we begin our Sukkos celebration. Of all the Jewish holidays, Sukkos is the most anachronistic. It is a harvest festival, it was marked by sacrifices on behalf of the Nations of the World, the highlight of the holiday was a libation ceremony in the Temple, we still sit in huts that resemble huts people actually used to used, and we still wave four particularly Middle Eastern species of vegetation. Not to mention the very recent innovation of Simchas Torah.<span id="more-7651"></span></p>
<p>When one looks for divrei Torah on the holiday it&#8217;s slim pickings. There is no Hagaddah. There is no special prayer book. There is no magnificent event or overt miracle that is being celebrated either. Rabbis inevitably talk about Hakhel, the unity represented by the Four Species, Koheles, or the usual metaphors associated with the Sukkah. It&#8217;s not very fertile ground.</p>
<p>So what are we to make of Sukkos today?<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7652" alt="sukkot1_1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/sukkot1_1.jpg" /></p>
<p>I think Sukkos speaks to the perpetuity of Judaism despite social and historical change. Our circumstances change, but we keep plugging away. Sukkos today feels different than it felt to our ancestors. That does not matter at all. Their huts were real huts. Our Sukkahs are elaborate and quite comfortable. Their Four Species were rare and only some people had nice sets. We all have beautiful sets.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve taken a harvest holiday and turned it into a culmination of the High Holidays. We have managed to make Sukkos a day that focuses on more elevated concepts but the integrity of the holiday remains intact. We used to call it <em>Zman Simchaseinu</em> because of our bountiful harvest. Now we call it <em>Zman Simchaseinu</em> because we feel redeemed following our repentance of the High Holidays. Things change but they stay the same.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Sukkos is a model of how Judaism adapts without compromise. We do everything the Torah asks us to do as best as we can do it but it has as very different flavor. Yet, Sukkos persists and prospers. It&#8217;s a beautiful holiday full of spiritual moments, family time, and meaningful rituals.</p>
<p>I wish you all a beautiful holiday. People say <em>Chag Kasher V&#8217;Sameach </em>on Pesach. It&#8217;s equally appropriate on Sukkos. We need our Sukkah and <em>Arba Minim</em> to be kosher and the holiday requires us to be joyful. So I say <em>Chag Kasher V&#8217;Sameach</em> to you. See you after the holiday.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>One of the most prominent themes of the High Holidays is our relationship with God as expressed by <em>Avinu Malkeinu.</em> This stirring prayer that has is origins in the Talmud makes use of a dual metaphor that informs so many of our thoughts and prayers this time of year.</p>
<p>Typically, the two metaphors represent different aspects of the way God relates to us and the way we relate to God. On the one hand God is our father and loves us like a father loves his children. We are God&#8217;s children and we look to God the way a child looks to a father. This is a compassionate, loving relationship that gives us comfort that no matter what</p>
<p>On the other hand God is our King. In this aspect of our relationship with God we find ourselves cowering in fear of God&#8217;s majesty and greatness. God is Master of the Universe. It&#8217;s God&#8217;s world and we are just guests in God&#8217;s world for a little while. This is meant to inspire reverence and respect for God.</p>
<p><span id="more-7604"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7607" alt="15" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/15.jpg" /></p>
<p>Put together, the two sides of the God Coin illuminate our attitudes this time of year. God loves us and is our Father, but God is also our King. There is plenty to say on this dichotomy. Perhaps we can take the usual interpretations of this dual metaphor one step deeper.</p>
<p>One does not choose one&#8217;s father. Fathers are imposed upon us. Everyone has a father. There is nothing particularly interesting about having a father. It&#8217;s built into the system. But most importantly, we can&#8217;t swap (biological) fathers. For better or worse, we&#8217;re stuck.</p>
<p>Monarchs are different. It&#8217;s true that one seems to be stuck with the king of the land where one is born. But the truth is that kings come and go. Borders change and people move. It&#8217;s a pure choice, but decided to pledge fealty to one&#8217;s king is a form of personal subjugation. It takes an act by the subject to crystallize the King and Subject relationship. If you don&#8217;t like your king you can try to mount a revolt or leave the area of jurisdiction. One day the king will die. Kings are not permanent nor are they automatic.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to God is there a choice? The kingship of God is not dependent on anything that we can do. It is automatic. We cannot leave God&#8217;s jurisdiction and move somewhere else to find another God. We are stuck.</p>
<p>That is why we also compare God to a father. While it&#8217;s true that God is like a king, the metaphor is incomplete. Comparing God to a king only goes so far. God cannot be deposed nor can one find a better or different God. That&#8217;s why we also need to compare God to a father. God is a king that is imposed upon us. We cannot trade Gods nor do we have a choice about who our God will be. In this sense, God as our father illustrates the imperative nature of God&#8217;s kingship over us.</p>
<p>Conversely, when we relate to God as a father we can feel stuck in a negative sense. We can wish we had a different father or we can dream about being free from the shadow of our parents. This is why we sometimes need to relate to God as our king. We voluntarily accept God as our king and as our father. This aspect of God as our king transforms our relationship with God as a father. It&#8217;s not just that we deal with God like a sometimes petulant child that would love to break free of God. We willingly subjugate ourselves in God&#8217;s kingdom even though we God is our father.</p>
<p>Above all else, I think this dual metaphor must inspire us to strive to be good sons and daughters to God as well as good subjects. Sometimes we act toward God with the love and admiration of a son or daughter. Other times we need to draw on the strength of relating to God as subjects in God&#8217;s eternal kingdom. It&#8217;s not enough to think about God as our father and king. We must also think about how <em>we are</em> God&#8217;s children and the people who live in God&#8217;s kingdom. The metaphor can&#8217;t stop with how we think about God. The metaphor needs to affect the way we think about ourselves as well.</p>
<p>When we appreciate the metaphor of <em>Avinu Malkeinu</em> we can feel a sense of love and fear that mixes together in the perfect service of God cocktail. Drink up!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em>“I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore choose life, so that you may live, you and your children.”</em> &#8211; Deuteronomy 30:19</p>
<p>As we near the end of the life and times of Moses, his speech to the Israelites picks up steam and power. One of the most profound statements in the Torah is found near the beginning of this week’s parsha. Moses tells the Israelites that heaven and earth bear witness that Moses has given the Israelites a choice. The ultimate choice. They can choose life or they can choose death. Then in dramatic fashion, the people are then instructed to choose life.<span id="more-7592"></span></p>
<p>Choose life! To life! <em>L’chaim</em>! This is the essence of Judaism. We toast to life. We sing to life. Life is a gift and we choose to use it well. The life we are given is a life of choices. We are instructed to make the choices that are the choices of life. It is so simple, yet so profound. Especially when we consider the religious leanings of the ancients, where death was so integral to their religions, where human sacrifice was normal, the Torah’s charge to choose life bellows loudly with its profundity and its eternal message echoes across the millennia.</p>
<p>This verse is an example of the best of the Bible. Its dramatic overtones staking out the all encompassing issues of the human experience. When our souls feel lost we must always remember to choose life. That is the great compass of Judaism. Find life and go that way. Choose life!<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7593" alt="choices" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/choices-600x449.jpg" /></p>
<p>For all its drama in the Bible, the Talmud brings this verse back down to earth with a shocking thud. Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva have a dispute about just what it means to choose life. Rabbi Yishmael says that “life” refers to a trade or a craft &#8211; the ability to earn a livelihood. We are being instructed to choose a means to make a living. Rabbi Akiva says that life refers to matters of safety and recreation like swimming and boating. Ti him, choosing life means taking care of one’s physical condition and making certain that one is prepared for a physical world that carries with it inherent danger.</p>
<p>These interpretations, while utilitarian and wise, seem to be so impossible to hear in the context of the verse that we are left to wonder if these great rabbi can actually be serious. Moses is building to a crescendo in his speech and he takes a break from the sublime to discuss career options and water sports? The verse was so powerful in its basic meaning, where is the depth and the beauty now?</p>
<p>The obvious answer is yes. Indeed, it is sublime to live a life engaged in the world. That is the climax. That is the greatest life that can be chosen. We are to be active participants in the economic and social structure of our world and to do so ever mindful and aware of G-D and one’s Judaism &#8211; that is life! To choose life is to to live a life. An actual life. A normal, productive, material life. When one lives that life to its fullest and lives one’s Judaism to the fullest we are truly choosing life.</p>
<p>Choosing life does not mean that one should cut their self off from society. Life is to live amongst men and women. But to live this life elevated and infused with spirituality as one lives amongst others &#8211; that is to choose life. There is a place for meditation and reflection or even temporary complete immersion into Torah and purely spiritual pursuits. But <em>u’vacharta b’chaim</em> &#8211; to choose life &#8211; is only when that is firmly welded to material pursuits and responsibility.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yishmael was the same great sage who famously argued with Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. In his statement about the topic of working for a living, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai taught that one should do G-D’s will and their work will be performed by others. Rabbi Yishmael argued that one should work the land and earn a livelihood. His views on this matter are clear. Life is to work.</p>
<p>Rabbi Akiva attached himself to Bar Kochba. He was not satisfied living under the rule of a despotic and anti-Semitic Roman government. He dreamed of autonomy and safety. The idea was to rise up and rebel militarily. With weapons and men at arms. Rabbi Akiva did not rely on his piety or Torah study to protect him or the people. Nor did he assume that his Torah study would be sufficient to restore the land into Jewish hands. Rabbi Akiva supported a physical army in addition to the merits of Torah and Mitzvos.</p>
<p>Choose life means choose to live a life engaged in the world all the while meticulously adhering to G-D’s word and living a life of Torah, Mitzvos and <em>Kiddush Hashem</em>. Indeed, this is a profound statement worthy of placement in the climactic peak of this speech of Moses. It is not just life, it is our way of life.</p>
<p>Speaking to his congregation following the Woodstock Festival in 1969, Rabbi Lamm talked about Hippie culture as compared to Judaism. Hippies believed that life was an opportunity to “live it up.” Love, music, and drugs were pathways to nirvana in their worldview.</p>
<p>To this, Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva respond and say we choose life with work. To live means to earn a livelihood. To live means to be prepared for life’s difficult moments. The truly virtuous life is not the life of shortcuts and temporarily highs. When we choose life we are choosing to live a life of challenges. We meet those challenges with Torah principles along with secular training. When we are able to navigate the difficult moments in our lives, when we can grow from trying times, when we use our gifts and talents to transcend the material world, then we are truly choosing life.</p>
<p>Hippies are passé. Woodstock a distant memory. But contemporary society has adopted so much of that worldview into modern thinking. Freedom and love are enough to give meaning to life and they are enough to truly live. Our response is that to truly find freedom and love we must work to get there. That is how we choose life. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<div>“The LORD will establish you for a holy people to Himself, as He has sworn to you; if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in His ways. And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the LORD is called upon you; and they shall be [...]</div>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><i>“The LORD will establish you for a holy people to Himself, as He has sworn to you; if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in His ways. And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the LORD is called upon you; and they shall be afraid of you.” &#8211; Deuteronomy 28:9-10 </i></p>
<p>Before Moses delivers a litany of curses upon the Israelites he offers some words of hope and blesses the people. In summary, Moses tells the people that if they follow the word of G-D all kinds of good things will happen for them. <i>“You will blessed in the city and you will be blessed in the field.”</i> And so on.<span id="more-7558"></span></p>
<p>The incentive to be good is strong. One of the more powerful verses of blessing describes how we will be perceived by the nations of the world if we are obedient to G-D’s word. The verse tells us that people of the earth will “see G-D’s name upon us” and they will be afraid of us.</p>
<p>What is this fear? Why will the nations fear us? What is this name of G-D that arouses this fear?<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Ki-Savo-2013-Web-Dvar-Torah.pdf"><br />
</a><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7560" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/monumental-tefillin-600x448.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Talmud (Brachos 6a) says that R’ Eliezer teaches us that this “name of G-D” is the <i>Tefillin</i> that is worn upon the head. One has to wonder what R’ Eliezer means with this statement. Does he meant that if we wear our <i>tefillin </i>we will be protected from persecution and ridicule? Are the <i>tefillin</i> a magical talisman? Is it that simple? Is that even possible?</p>
<p>There are photos of great Jewish martyrs during the Holocaust wearing their <i>Tefillin</i>. It seems that the Nazis did not fear our <i>tefillin</i>. What happened? Was it just a matter of us not being worthy of the blessing? Exactly what is R’ Eliezer saying?</p>
<p>Rabbi Lamm explains R’ Eliezer’s statement by observing the context of the Talmudic passage. Immediately after R’ Eliezer says that the “name of G-D” upon us is the <i>tefillin </i>that is worn upon the head, the Talmud wonders about G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i></p>
<p>The Talmud asks: And what is written in G-D’s <i>tefillin</i>? In G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>we would find a verse lauding the Jewish people. “Who is like the Jewish people, one nation upon the earth?” Meaning, our <i>tefillin</i> speak to G-D’s unity as expressed in the four chapters we place inside, accordingly G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>speak to our unity. It’s a symbiotic relationship. We express G-D’s unity and G-D expresses ours.</p>
<p>In a novel twist, Rabbi Lamm proclaims that R’ Eliezer was not actually referring to our <i>tefillin </i>at all! Rather he was referring to G-D’s <i>tefillin!</i> That is the context of the <i>sugya. </i>In other words, when we live the maxim of G-D’s <i>tefillin</i> then the people of the earth will fear us. What is that maxim? That we have unity and that we are a singular nation.</p>
<p>When we are comfortable and confident in our singularity we succeed. R’ Eliezer is teaching us to be strong in our ability to stand on our own. If we can stand strong on our own, we inspire awe from the people of the earth. When we are not vying for approval or desperately trying to assimilate, we are demonstrating to the world the message of G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i> However, if do try to leave our Jewishness at home, or worse in the trash heap of history, the people of the earth will not find anything awesome about the Jewish people.</p>
<p>The idea is that when people are confident in their convictions and believe what they are doing is right, they earn the respect of others. Of course, this only applies when one is also respectful and kind to the others. Acting zealously because we think we are right and everyone else is wrong will undoubtably result in treatment in kind. If we are hateful toward others or act in a manner that breeds hate, we can expect to be treated at least as badly by those others. But there is a way to act in confidence with respect for others. This is exactly what R’ Eliezer was trying to say. When we are doing the right thing, with the confidence of G-D’s <i>tefillin</i> we earn the awe and reverence of others.</p>
<p>This is all on a national level. When the Jewish people as a whole act the way they are supposed to act, and we do so with confidence and pride, we gain the respect of others.</p>
<p>As much as it applies to us as a people, it applies to us as individuals as well. We can see this from the the man who taught us this lesson in the Talmud. It’s not just our confidence as a nation but also confidence as individual people.</p>
<p>R’ Eliezer lived this maxim. He found himself on the opposing side of the rabbis of his generation time and time again. His opinions are disproportionately unpopular. R’ Eliezer is most well known for the incident regarding the <i>tanur shel achnai</i> where his opinion differed from the other sages. But he stood by his convictions even inviting nature itself to testify on his behalf. It did not matter than his colleagues had the numbers. R’ Eliezer believed he was right. Ultimately, none of that mattered as we follow the majority in rabbinic disputes of halacha. Indeed, R’ Eliezer paid a price as he lived out his days in isolation as punishment for not acceding to the rabbis. But R’ Eliezer stood tall and true to his convictions. R’ Eliezer’s strength and confidence shines through this and other episodes in the Talmud. He lived the ideas G-D’s <i>tefillin.</i></p>
<p>As a people we struggle with this. On the one hand we have adapted and adopt from our surroundings over the course of our collective history. There is tension between this chameleon-like attitude toward our environment and our ancient traditions that sometimes put us at odds with our neighbors and their ideas. It requires us to dance around the raindrops sometimes. But we must remember that we believe we have the truth. We must be careful to be respectful and friendly to all who are not members of our group while we stand by our convictions with confidence.</p>
<p>Within Judaism we have subgroups as well. Each is entitled to believe it is doing Judaism the right way. However our confidence in our subgroup cannot allow us lose respect and courtesy to our co-religionists from other subgroups. If we pervert our confidence in our way of life with hate and demonization of others our confidence is mere braggadocio.</p>
<p>We certainly should feel that our way of life is the right way to live. Some subgroups excel at this while other languish in self-loathing. I think the least confident subgroup in Judaism is Modern Orthodoxy. This is not a criticism of the Modern Orthodox theology, rather it is a reflection of a sad reality that too many Modern Orthodox Jews feel second class.</p>
<p>All subgroups should feel confident that they are doing G-D’s will. All subgroups should be respectful of the other subgroups. Modern Orthodoxy should be proud of their way of life. There is no need to constantly defer to other subgroups. Modern Orthodoxy can be vibrant and viable in our world.</p>
<p>When Modern Orthodoxy can live confidently it will flourish. It will find G-D’s <i>tefillin </i>are easily discerned among Modern Orthodox Jews. With the deftness that only Modern Orthodoxy can possess, its people will inspire awe and wonder among the people of the earth, not least of which, the rest of the Jewish people. - <em>Good Shabbos</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The best database of <em>seforim </em>(books written about Torah topics are called <em>seforim</em> even though the word just means books, it has connotations of holiness and importance) is Otzar HaHochma. The Otzar has every sefer you could possibly need. They have 47,350 books in the their database.

<p>420 books of the Ahavat Shalom Publishers, including books published for the first time from manuscripts as well as fundamental books.</p>

assistance of Kehat Publishing.</p>
<p><b>Network license</b>: <b>$210 </b>for each station.</p>
<p>Notice anything interesting?</p>
<p>The full database includes 47,350 books. But one can get a 45,150 book version as well. (Otzar thinks this is 1200 fewer books. It&#8217;s actually 2200). This version is called the &#8220;Bnei Torah&#8221; edition. The words bnei Torah are used to imply one is a yeshiva student or charedi. It&#8217;s unfortunate that one cannot be considered a modern ben Torah, but such is the foible of language. So if you are a ben Torah you don&#8217;t want access to 2,200 of the books on the Otzar database. These books are deemed inappropriate for charedim because they are inconsistent with charedi perspectives.</p>
<p>This is incredible. All the books in the Otzar are frum texts. They are all legitimate <em>seforim</em> from reputable Torah scholars. Yet, a small segment of these books is not consistent with charedi thinking. Well of course not! Not everything in Judaism has always been charedi. That much is obvious to any Torah scholar. But in order to reinforce an imaginary history where nothing was inconsistent with charedi Judaism, these books are excised from the subscription. It&#8217;s really amazing. These are not anti-orthodox books. That&#8217;s for sure. These are just books that &#8220;do not correspond to the Haredi sector.&#8221; Turns out, it&#8217;s forbidden to read books that might inform you that your way of life is not the only way of life that is legitimate within orthodox Judaism. Pretty sad.</p>
<p>As for me, I want a list of these 2200 books. I also want to know who the censor is and what the criteria are for removal from the Bnei Torah list. I also want to learn those 2200 seforim, pronto.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The most important discussion in orthodox Judaism right now is the pair of articles written by R&#8217; Zev Farber. The articles have been deemed heresy by R&#8217; Gordimer on Cross-Currents. If you are averse to reading anything that might touch on issues and ideas that are possibly heretical please stop reading and pick up a Nesivos Shalom or something.</p>
<p>Still here? Okay. The two articles say different things so I&#8217;d like to briefly address the <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2013/07/18/from-openness-to-heresy/" target="_blank">Cross-Currents post</a> as it relates to the &#8220;<a href="http://thetorah.com/devarim-recounting-different/" target="_blank">short article.</a>&#8221; This article went through two versions. R&#8217; Gordimer&#8217;s article used the first version which was more objectionable. R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s article was edited a full week before the article on Cross-Currents was published. I find this to be egregious. If you are going to call someone a heretic, possibly the worst thing to call an orthodox Jew, you best be sure that every detail of your case is accurate.<span id="more-7405"></span></p>
<p>The original version said this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The simplest explanation for these differences between the accounts in Exodus-Numbers and Deuteronomy is that they were penned by (at least) two different authors with different conceptions of the desert experience.</em></p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Despite sharing many details with the desert story as told in Exodus and Numbers, there is no way to make the two versions work with each other without unreasonably stretching the meaning of the texts. Whether it be the description of the scout story, the reaction of the Edomites and Moabites to Israel’s request, or the legitimacy of dwelling in the Transjordan, the two versions work with contradictory assumptions.</em></p>
<p>I can see why R&#8217; Gordimer thinks this is heresy. I don&#8217;t think it has to be as will be discussed later. But the second version is almost certainly not heresy. This is the revised version:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Despite sharing many details with the desert story as told in Exodus and Numbers, there appears to be no way to make the two versions work with each other without unreasonably stretching the meaning of the texts. The simplest literary approach is the academic one which posits multiple authors with multiple traditions. How such an approach meshes with traditionalist belief requires serious thought but it is necessary to start by recognizing the simplicity and straightforwardness of the academic approach.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7406" alt="Bible1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bible1.jpg" /></p>
<p>There is nothing remarkable about this statement. It simply states that the academic approach is simpler. Simpler is not necessarily more truthful. Thus, there is no value judgment on whether the academic approach is preferable. I hope that if this was the only thing R&#8217; Farber said, it would not have created a controversy. I hope. For this reason, I am disappointed in the Cross-Currents article.</p>
<p>However, whenever I raise this point I am reminded of the other &#8220;<a href="http://thetorah.com/torah-history-judaism-introduction/" target="_blank">long article</a>&#8221; where the heresy is stronger and harder to wiggle out of.</p>
<p>On to the second article.</p>
<p>This is R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s worldview. It is his Grand Theory of Everything. His goal is clear. R&#8217; Farber wants very badly to harmonize all the things he has taken for granted as an orthodox Jew, his adherence to halacha and social orthodoxy, with modern Biblical Criticism. This is his goal and it is important to begin with an appreciation of his assumptions.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Farber takes the challenges presented by Bible critics very seriously. It&#8217;s hard not to take them seriously. They are asking good questions. It&#8217;s true that we have &#8220;frum&#8221; answers for most of these questions and some of the questions are not so bothersome. Yet, the challenges exist.</p>
<p>The maximalist Bible critic answer is the text is not Divine. It is a text that comes from people and therefore any anomaly is understood as poor editing by a later redactor. The various writers have different agendas and their works reflect their personal biases.</p>
<p>The maximalist orthodox Jewish answer is that the text is Divine. It is a text that comes from God and therefore any anomaly is understood as part of the infinite wisdom of the Author of the Torah. The different versions of stories and laws reflect Divine intent to teach us everything we need to know.</p>
<p>There is a huge chasm between these two approaches. They share nothing other than the questions that they ask.</p>
<p>But most thinking people know that the maximalist orthodox Jewish position is untenable. No one really thinks that. The people who do are &#8220;mesorah maximalists&#8221; who will hide from the truth to support their position. The Talmud discusses the last few verses of Devarim. Chazal had a different midpoint to their Torah scrolls. Ezra reconciled the texts of several versions of Torah scrolls. Maimonides reconciled errors he found in Torah scrolls using the Aleppo Codex. Rashi had at least one discrepancy in his Torah scroll. Ibn Ezra famously said that there are twelve places in the Chumash that speak in present tense and those were not written by Moses.</p>
<p>In other words, we know that some parts of the Chumash were not spoken by God to Moses. That&#8217;s certainly acceptable in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>We also know that there is a dispute about the very nature of the book of Devarim. The Ramban says it was given word for word from God to Moses at Sinai. Others say Moses spoke these words as prophecy. Contrasted with the rest of the Chumash, it is more similar to the books of the prophets than Sefer Vayikra in this respect. The Avnei Nezer says that Devarim is a bridge between the Written Law and the Oral Law as it is Moshe&#8217;s discourse where he darshens the first four books of the Chumash.</p>
<p>The point is obvious. Devarim is treated differently by the Medieval commentators. The maximalist orthodox Jewish answer is not a reasonable position. Legitimate sources recognize this and we must recognize this as well. The question I wish to address is why. Why do we find these sort of opinions about Devarim and other scattered examples throughout the Chumash?</p>
<p>There are two possible answers. I think here we find a difference of opinion loosely based on affiliation. Charedim subscribe to one view and non-charedim subscribe to another.</p>
<p>Charedim are more apt to say that God included all aforementioned items when God gave the Torah to Moses. God told Moses to make the book of Devarim sound different. It was part of God&#8217;s plan that errors rf anachronisms creep into the text for the sake of the answers that would be given later. They were latent in the text the entire time but were waiting for the right people to reveal them.</p>
<p>Non-Charedim are more likely to take a different approach. This alternative approach holds that things may have happened after revelation and great Torah authorities used their wisdom and Torah knowledge to answer the questions in the best way they know how. This means that the issues that forced the hand of the great sages were the result of history, scribal errors, or any other circumstance that could have caused the problems. The answers are true to Torah because of the people who said them and their universal acceptance by the greater Jewish people.</p>
<p>We could say the same thing about the drashos we find in Chazal whether they be Halachic or Aggadic. One way of looking at it is that these drashos were latent in the text, they were always there, they were always kept, they were just &#8220;revealed&#8221; by the various tanaim and amoraim. The other view is that these drashos were Chazal&#8217;s way of dealing with textual and perhaps social or religious issues. They could have learned differently, but they chose to learn this way. The drashos that gained consensus became Torah. This approach certainly rings true when studying the Talmud.</p>
<p>Why did one opinion in the Talmud say that the last verses in Devarim were not written by Moses? Because he had a mesorah? Or was it simply the easiest solution to a very obvious problem? I think it is more elegent to sat that he saw a problem and this was his solution. To say otherwise means that at some point the mesorah was lost and a disagreement developed and the rabbis were merely reporters of their tradition as opposed to Torah giants with ideas of their own.</p>
<p>It is possible that the version I ascribe to more charedi orthodox Jews is correct. But I don&#8217;t think it is correct. It&#8217;s hard to believe that Chazal came along and just explained what was already known to everyone. But even if the charedi version is correct with regard to Chazal, it is almost certainly not correct with regard to the rishonim.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard people say that Rashi on Chumash is a semi-prophetic work. Rashi was Divinely inspired to comment on each verse and his commentary reflects God&#8217;s intended interpretation of the verses. This is a disservice to Rashi. It seems to me that Rashi saw inconsistencies or anomolies in the text and he chose his preferred interpretations from his vast knowledge of Chazal&#8217;s teachings. Rashi saw a problem and Rashi provided the solution.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s easier to see where this is taking us by looking at Ibn Ezra and Rambam. Why did the Ibn Ezra say that there are 7 places in the Chumash that are not original to the text? Was it something handed down to him from his teachers? I don&#8217;t think so. I am fairly certain that Ibn Ezra saw a problem in the text, there was evidence that contravened the accepted (or maybe it wasn&#8217;t accepted at that time) wisdom that every word of the Torah was given to Moses by God and those were the exact same words they had in the 11th century Torah scrolls. His solution was to accept the evidence and change the dogma. Religion cannot contradict truth so Ibn Ezra adjusted the religion accordingly.</p>
<p>Rambam managed to make the Torah consistent with Greek and Arabic philosophy. Do we think that Rambam thought that Greek and Arabic philosophy were handed to Moses from God at Sinai? That&#8217;s preposterous. Rather, Rambam held that the maxims he accepted in those non-Jewish sources were the truth. If they are true, then the Torah must work with Greek and Arabic philosophy. Rambam made it work. It&#8217;s the same idea. Rambam accepted external evidence and then conformed the Torah to make sense in the context of his truth. Truth cannot be changed. But sometimes religious dogma can be changed. Even more surprising is that Rambam did not say &#8220;prove Greek and Arabic philosophy to me and then I will work out the Torah but until then I accept the Torah as truth and all this secular stuff is obviously wrong.&#8221; He simply accepted the secular wisdom as true and conformed Torah to that truth.</p>
<p>This is how the rishonim and Chazal dealt with Torah vs. evidence.</p>
<p>Similarly, when both Chazal and rishonim encountered a verse or section that seemed too unlikely to be literal, they interpreted it metaphorically. We don&#8217;t circumcise our hearts because that verse was deemed allegorical. Rishonim, like Ralbag and Rambam went even further by turning sections that contradicted their common sense into dream-sequences or metaphors. Many rishonim and even some achronim have done the same thing with difficult passages in the Talmud. If it can&#8217;t be explained literally because of evidence then it could be allegorized. (Granted, some achronim felt no pangs of guilt by simply saying that Chazal were incorrect.)</p>
<p>The point to all this is to demonstrate how things have changed. The achronim lived in a time where science and other evidence was used to counter religion, not bolster it. In turn, they began the trend of lifting religion above the fray and arguing that the science or other evidence must be reinterpreted to fit religion. If it could not reinterpreted, it was wrong. This is the paradigm of almost all religions since the Renaissance and Enlightenment. There were exceptions to this rule, but for the most part this rule has held firm for several hundred years. Evolution doesn&#8217;t seem to fit in with Biblical narratives? Despite much more evidence than there is for the erroneous astronomy Rambam used in the Mishneh Torah, religious people all over the world are fighting against evolution. The Bible seems to be a composite work? Religious people reply that it&#8217;s impossible. Chazal seemed to be mistaken about medicine or science or math? Our modern thinking must be wrong, or alternatively the Talmud meant something else, or alternatively nature has changed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s such a different attitude from the way Torah scholars approached evidence for almost 2000 years.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t learn Chumash the same way the rishonim learned Chumash. Instead we learn what the rishonim said about the Chumash. This handicaps us from being too innovative on the one hand and has a way of maintaining tradition on the other hand.</p>
<p>I believe, what R&#8217; Farber is trying to do is to relaunch the ancient way of studying Chumash. How would Chazal or some of the rishonim reacted to the evidence presented by Biblical Criticism? If they were consistent, I believe they would have done something like R&#8217; Farber has done in his long article. I am not commenting on R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s academically leaning conclusions. There are other conclusions that could be reached by the questions raised. But his version is certainly a valid conclusion, especially when one only takes the academic data and for the sake of argument ignores the religious approach.</p>
<p>In his long article R&#8217; Farber allegorizes some things. Other things are seen as products of editing over time. We have seen that allegorization is an acceptable form of interpretation. We have also seen that it was obvious that to Chazal and rishonim that the text of the Torah had been edited. R&#8217; Gordimer and others take issue with both of these devices.</p>
<p>Allegorizing too much of the text could create a problem for people. It might be seen as cannibalizing the Torah. If the narratives are not literal then are they meaningful? R&#8217; Farber says yes. Others seem to say no. I don&#8217;t see a reason to say no. I only see a fear of what might happen if we say no. R&#8217; Farber is trying to lay the groundwork for allegorization not to be a problem.</p>
<p>As to the issue of subsequent editing of the Torah I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s a huge problem. R&#8217; Farber is not saying that random people came around and edited the Torah. I think R&#8217; Farber is saying that the edits were made by prophets. The same way we take the works of the prophets seriously and we take them as divine books, we can take edits to the Bible. Our Tanach is filled with various voices that sound very different. Sometimes these books contradict one another. But it&#8217;s okay because we know that they all came from God and God speaks through each prophet in a different way. If prophets did the same thing to the Torah, it&#8217;s true that this would be a very different way of looking at Torah, but in the end, it&#8217;s just as binding on us. It&#8217;s equally the word of God. <a href="http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6372&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=90" target="_blank">There is a rishon</a> who says something like this with regard to the stories in the Torah.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s approach completely changes what we mean by Torah M&#8217;Sinai as well. But is the belief in our version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai a necessary belief for orthodox Judaism to work? Perhaps not.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s worldview is the articulation of how Revelation and Torah M&#8217;Sinai works. Professor Tamar Ross makes an attempt at this, and I don&#8217;t think it satisfactory (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/12/torah-msinai-according-to-professor-tamar-ross/">Torah M’Sinai According to Professor Tamar Ross</a> ) R&#8217; Farber articulates his beliefs at the end of the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe in Torah Min Ha-Shamayim, that the Torah is from heaven, and that the entirety of the book is nevua (prophecy) and represents the encounter between God and the people of Israel.</li>
<li>I believe in Torah mi-Sinai, meaning the uniqueness of the Torah as being of a higher order than any other work in its level of divine encounter. The story of the revelation at Sinai in the Torah I understand as a narrative depiction of a deeper truth—the Torah is God’s book and the divine blueprint for Israel and Jewish life.</li>
<li>I believe that the Torah is meant to be as it is today and that all of its verses, from “Timnah was a concubine” (Gen. 36:12) to “I am the Lord your God,” are holy.</li>
<li>I believe that halakha and Jewish theology must develop organically from Torah interpretation and not by excising or ignoring any part of the Torah or Chazal’s interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p>They sound pretty safe and pretty reasonable. But I also think that this kind of Torah M&#8217;Sinai is too nuanced to catch on and it sounds too heretical to gain traction.</p>
<p>It seems to me that R&#8217; Farber is trying to use orthodox principles to push orthodox Judaism into a discussion about our sacred texts.</p>
<p>If this is what R&#8217; Farber is doing, and I am pretty sure it is, we can say that he has good intentions. We can also say that it deserves a conversation and not to be shot down as heretical immediately. I was particularly upset that the article on Cross-Currents did not articulate the objections to R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s statements. Instead quotes were mined and the audience was expected to simply conclude that the statements were heretical. It is symptomatic of a larger problem in orthodox Judaism where reason and debate are stifled. Dogmatic proclamations are very much in style. Well argued responsa died with R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein.</p>
<p>Purely for the sake of honest religious debate, I think that R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s approach demands a discussion and not condemnation. But for the social reasons I think there is even more benefit to an inclusive approach. We should not be rooting for a breakaway from orthodoxy by the Left, nor should we even give the appearance of rooting for it. One thing that Yeshiva Chovevei Torah and its community do well, is inclusivity. The times we live in are dark in some ways, but people are more capable than ever before to think on their own and formulate their judgments. I see no benefit to jettisoning an entire group of people and the people who are sympathetic to them because of controversial statements. I am aware that this is a time-honored custom of Jews and religious people everywhere. I just don&#8217;t see the utility in it anymore. Our best defense against losing the battle vs. complete secularism is not insularity and narrowing the playing field. Our best defense is the exact opposite.</p>
<p>If we want to have a small narrow-minded cult that ignores the outside world and in turn is ignored by the outisde world we should continue the trend of ousting people and movements from orthodox Judaism. If we want to keep a foothold in the outside world and carry weight and influence in a world that could certainly use some of our wisdom, we need to keep the broadest base possible.</p>
<p>I hope that R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s article and the entire theTorah.com website can become a springboard for education and discussion. Inclusivity to the maximum should be our goal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em>“And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was angered, and swore, saying: Surely there shall not one of these men, even this evil generation, see the good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers. […] Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying: Thou also shalt not go in either;” &#8211; Deuteronomy 1:34-35, 37</em></p>
<p>Moses spend his final days exhorting the Israelites to follow the word of G-d. In addition to his encouragement, Moses reminds the Israelites of their short history and the events that brought them to this juncture on the banks of the Jordan River about to enter the Land of Israel.</p>
<p>The book begins with a recap of the story of the spies. Moses fills in some of the blanks in the story in this retelling of the tale. The people are reminded that none of the sinners from the incident would be entering the Land of Israel. Interestingly, Moses includes himself in those who would not be entering the Promised Land due to the sin of the spies.<span id="more-7376"></span></p>
<p>The problem is that the Torah tells us in Parshas Chukas that Moses would not enter the Land of Israel because of his sin at Mei Meriva. When Moses was supposed to draw water from a rock by speaking to it he sinned and that is the reason he was banned from the land. It was not because of the spies. What are we to make of these remarks by Moses? Why is he saying he won’t be going to Israel as a punishment for the incident with the spies?<img class="size-medium wp-image-7377 alignright" alt="Moses_Pleading_with_Israel" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Moses_Pleading_with_Israel-437x600.jpg" width="437" height="600" /></p>
<p>Throughout the sojourn in the desert, the Israelites doggedly complained to Moses. They were relentless. If it wasn’t water, it was bread. If it wasn’t bread, it was meat. If it wasn’t meat, it was vegetables. There was always something to complain about. Indeed, the Israelites logged numerous complaints to Moses.</p>
<p>R’ Schwab says that if we look at all the complaints, we notice that they all shared one common thread. The people repeatedly accused Moses of taking them out of Egpyt to die in the desert. They asked time after time “Why have you taken us out of Egypt?”</p>
<p>The essence of this complaint is that Moses was a rebel leader who decided on his own to flee Egypt. The people were blaming Moses for their circumstances. In order for this complaint to make sense the assumption must be that Moses was not following G-d’s word, rather he was doing as he pleased. When he was caught in a bind, the people called him on his supposed recklessness.</p>
<p>During the incident of the spies, the people complained to Moses. They said: And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them: &#8216;Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would we had died in this wilderness! &#8211; Number 14:2</p>
<p>It is the familiar canard. Moses was to blame for their troubles with the spies as well.</p>
<p>This despite the baselessness for their accusation. Moses was acting upon the word of G-d. He had no say in the itinerary. He was as much a passenger on the journey as the rest of the people. But still, he was being blamed. Worse, he was being accused of acting on his own accord and thus he was culpable.</p>
<p>Human nature is such that hearing something over and over again for forty years will inevitably have an impact on the person. It’s impossible for it not to make an impression on the person’s psyche. It’s not quite brainwashing, but it’s a similar principle. When we are told a lie so many times over the course of so many years it begins to wear on us. We start to think that it might even be true. We start to believe the negative publicity.</p>
<p>Maybe Moses heard these accusations so many times over the course of the last 40 years that he started giving them some credence. Their accusation that he did things on his own without the approval of G-d took it’s toll. He started to think that maybe he was doing things on his own.</p>
<p>That is why he hit the rock instead of talking to the rock. Moses made the colossal error of thinking that he was the one doing the decision making and not G-d. Subconsciously, he decided to hit the rock to do it his own way. For this he was punished.</p>
<p>Now, while recounting the story of the spies and the accusation that he was a lone ranger acting without G-d’s approval Moses tells the people how much he was affected by their complaints. He tells the Israelites that their constant complaining had an effect on him and when he hit the rock part of it was because of what the Israelites had been saying to him for all those years.</p>
<p>The reason Moses was punished was because he hit the rock. But maybe the reason he hit the rock was because of the sort of complaints he had been subject to for 40 years. Case in point, the sin of the spies and the accusations and insults which accompanied the incident. Moses was told too many times that he was a renegade leader. Eventually his mind fooled him into believing it, if only for just a millisecond. But the damage was done. Moses hit the rock. Thus Moses mentions that he has been punished and will not be entering the Land of Israel while recounting the story of the spies.</p>
<p>In our lives we hear a lot about ourselves. Our parents and teachers tell us what they think about us. Friends and acquaintances make us aware of their opinions. Bosses and co-workers may express their feelings about us. Spouses and children tell us all that we need to know about ourselves. What they say might be true, it might not be true, but it definitely makes a difference.</p>
<p>We have to place ourselves in situations where we hear the right things about ourselves. Too much praise or too much criticism can make a real impression on our own thoughts about ourselves. Whether it artificially inflates our sense of self-worth, or if it artificially deflates our self-confidence, what other say about us makes a difference. It is wise for us to consider our social environment and analyze how we are being talked about in our daily lives.</p>
<p>Conversely, we have a huge responsibility to think about what we say about others. When it comes to our children, we have so much to say about them. Are we critical? Are we honest about their failings? Do they hear how much we love them? Do they hear how proud we are of their accomplishments? Do they hear a barrage of criticism? Do they get reminded of their shortcomings or negative personality quirks regularly?</p>
<p>We have so much power over what our children think of themselves. It would be wise for us to maximize their feelings of confidence and imbue them with an honesty about rising up to their challenges. What we say about them in person and what they hear us say about them will make a very big difference in the way they think about themselves.</p>
<p>The Jewish people as a whole are routinely discussed in the public arena. They say we are too much or this, or too little of that. We hear Jews being talked about it all the time. We read descriptions of Jewish people or Jewish ideas. Hearing lies over and over will take a toll on our collective psyche. We need to be sure that we do not believe everything we hear about ourselves. We cannot allow negativity dictate our communal mood.</p>
<p>It can be hard to stonewall what we hear about us as a group or as individuals. But being aware of the potential harm in believing our own publicity is the first step in avoiding it.</p>
<p>Above all, we cannot neglect our incredible opportunity to positively shape how others think about themselves. There is no part of our lives that this is more important that how we deal with our children and spouses. Let us use this knowledge to shower those closest to us with love, affection, positivity, and honesty. <em>- Good Shabbos</em></p>

<p><em>Write an article about modesty that is respectful to men and women, makes a case for an orthodox Jewish version of tznius, and it also has to make tznius sound pleasant.</em></p>
<p>Can I do it? This is my attempt.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of <i>tznius</i> in orthodox Judaism. The first is the concept of modesty. The second is the details of how <i>tznius</i> is observed in orthodox Judaism. I admit that it is much easier to make a case for the first aspect than it is for the second. But I submit that once one is convinced of the first aspect, the second aspect becomes much easier. But I am hopeful that we can carve out a third aspect to <i>tznius</i>, if not in practice yet, at least in theory.</p>
<p>The Sefer HaChinuch asks an excellent question. There is a mitzvah to kindle the fire of the altar in the Temple. A priest would light the fire every day. If the Temple needs a fire, someone has to to light it. The problem is that we have a tradition that the fire on the altar came from heaven and thus there was no need for a mere mortal to light the fire.</p>
<p><span id="more-7298"></span></p>
<p>Answers the Sefer HaChinuch, this is the way of God. Whenever God acts in a miraculous way that displays God&#8217;s greatness, God will seek to hide God&#8217;s greatness and make the miracle appear to be natural. There will always be a way to rationalize the miracle as a non-miracle. This explains the requirement that a priest light the fire on the altar. It must appear that God is not acting in a way that is clearly miraculous.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s reasonable to say that God&#8217;s &#8220;moment&#8221; in the Bible was the splitting of the Sea of Reeds. That was the bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, down by three runs, and God hits it out of the park for the win. It&#8217;s the defining moment in our relationship with God until this very day and one of the most dramatic episodes in the Bible. It&#8217;s very interesting to note what is recorded in the Torah before the sea actually split. We are told that Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and strong winds stirred up the sea water all night. The next day God split the sea.</p>
<p>The Chinuch explains that God&#8217;s miracles must be hidden. God could have been a show-off and designed this big moment to be as dramatic as possible. The waters could have been completely still, Moses could have been crying on his hands and knees begging for mercy, and then God would swoop in at the last possible moment and save the Israelites with a grand show. But instead God hid the miracle behind outstretched arms and swirling winds.</p>
<p>This is the way of our God. Our God is modest. Even our all powerful God chooses to limit God&#8217;s exposure when performing miracles. The Chinuch concludes that this is true greatness. One who is great is not one who needs to make a show of oneself. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Jewish modesty. <em>V&#8217;halachta b&#8217;drachav</em>. We emulate God&#8217;s character. <em>V&#8217;hatzneah leches im Elokecha</em>. Walk modestly with your God.</p>
<p>Every person should strive to be Godly. Greatness is found when people don&#8217;t expose everything. This is the paradigm that we learn from God. Overexposure is unGodly.</p>
<p>But what is the reason for this? Is it some rule that can&#8217;t be explained? Or can we make some sense of this?</p>
<p>I think it does have some basis in reality. We are easily distracted. Please note, I am not saying we are perverts or we have a hard time controlling ourselves. I am saying that our minds are biased towards simplicity and gravitate toward the external things that are easily seen. Marketers know this and they distract us with beautiful people in their ads for horse manure. But wisdom and maturity are seeing things that are beneath the surface. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>Of course it is entirely possible for a beautiful naked person to be espousing wisdom. It’s just harder to hear the wisdom. This had nothing to do with Judaism or God. Professors at universities, CEOs, and politicians in our Western society dress at least somewhat formally. We all understand this.</p>
<p>Taken to another level, we all disregard showboaters and over-aggressive, transparent, self-promotors. We dismiss those kinds of people and their ideas are taken far less seriously. Our minds know that greatness is usually not “in your face.” We know that greatness is hidden. I think this is the rational explanation for God&#8217;s behavior in hiding God&#8217;s miracles.</p>
<p>Modesty in Judaism is supposed to reflect this value. It applies equally to men and women and applies equally to clothing as it does to the rest of one&#8217;s life. This is the Jewish concept of modesty. It is the first aspect. It explains the value in limiting one&#8217;s external exposure.</p>
<p>If it ended here, we would all take this lesson to heart and try to make our own decisions in consonance with this ideal. Practices would vary but we would all try to live with this concept in our lives.</p>
<p>But orthodox Judaism is not just about ideas and concepts. The rabbis of the Talmud and their halachic heirs take these concepts and interpret them into laws. These are really old laws. Some are 2000 years old. Other more “recent” laws are only several hundred years old.</p>
<p>Over the millennia, the laws of each time and place were added to our legal codes. The rigid laws of our current <i>tznius</i> standards of clothing, whether from the stringent or lenient extremes are borne out of this system. They don&#8217;t really make sense today. They are not really expected to make sense today. These laws are mostly anachronistic.</p>
<p>Today’s laws seem to draw arbitrary lines about what can be seen and what may not be seen. There is little rhyme or reason and this is a breeding ground for stringencies and false displays of piety. With no firm halachic foundation, it is easy to invent new and improved ideas about <i>tznius </i>that can creep into society and become de facto standards seemingly overnight. Some people draw the line here and others draw the line over there. If you’re in doubt? Cover it up. Better to be safe than sorry. The spirit of <i>tznius </i>can be hard to find under these circumstances.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line it seems, we have collectively lost the ability to adapt our laws for modernity within the confines of halacha. That being said, orthodox Jews conform to halachic standards. Sometimes it&#8217;s not easy, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t really make perfect sense, but it&#8217;s the laws that we have and until they are abrogated they are the laws we must keep. This is the second aspect.</p>
<p>There is no real theological reason that <i>tznius</i> should be so heavily regulated and codified in Jewish law while all the other areas of our lives that require us to act with modesty are left to our whims and desires. Rather it is social. Dress codes and sensuality are things that people have traditionally been concerned with and thus we have a huge compilation of laws associated with <i>tznius</i>. This despite the fact that <i>tznius</i> in the Talmud is barely a blip on a very large radar. when it is mentioned it is mentioned as a restriction against reciting the Shema or matrimonial disputes. It is hardly recognizable as a formulaic dress code.</p>
<p>It can feel like there is a huge disconnect between the first aspect and the second aspect. To me it feels that way sometimes. But sometimes there is a price to pay if one wants to be part of orthodox Judaism. This is the way orthodox Judaism is now. It’s not perfect, but it’s the way the first aspect is attempted to be lived contemporarily.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think it always will have to be this way. Mormons also have very strict modesty laws. Their laws also relate to all areas of one&#8217;s life but there is a dress code as well. Their dress code is updated from time to time. It&#8217;s a modern version of modesty. There are some hard and fast rules, but it is not 17th century modesty. It is modern modesty. One who follows their guidelines would certainly be emulating God&#8217;s modesty of hiding greatness behind a veil.</p>
<p>However, if an orthodox Jew would dress in the Mormon way they would probably be shunned by their orthodox Jewish friends and neighbors. It&#8217;s almost certain that they would be chastised by rabbis and modesty activists. But I would venture to guess that they would be modest and they would be satisfying the Godly standard of the Chinuch.</p>
<p>There are two Judaisms. There is the Judaism between Jew and God and there is the Judaism between Jew and fellow Jew. They are not always the same thing.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is a good example of this. One can be dressed very respectfully, modestly, and Godly but still not follow the laws of <i>tznius</i> as they are practiced in orthodox Judaism today. Conversely, one can follow the letter of the law of <i>tznius</i> and be the complete opposite of Godly. We all know this is true.</p>
<p>Maybe, if there is enough demand and enough people who won&#8217;t look down their noses at people with subjective standards of modesty, the first and second aspects of <i>tznius</i> could be reunited. I don&#8217;t expect it to happen quickly, I don&#8217;t even expect it to happen at all. But it is something to think about.</p>
<p>Perhaps there will be some sort of reformation within orthodox Judaism and the standards of <i>tznius</i> will be updated to modern sensibilities. I think guidelines that are similar to the Mormon regulations would be far less criticized than the standards we have today. This, coupled with a severe toning down of <i>tznius</i> rhetoric, blame, and false promises of salvation would completely change the tenor of the <i>tznius</i> conversation. We should be talking about God&#8217;s <i>tznius</i>. The kind of greatness the Chinuch describes is what our goal should be.</p>
<p>At the very least, I think attempting to emulate God in this manner is valuable. It can improve our lives. We can begin to appreciate the wisdom of universal modesty that applies to men and women in all of our lives. Understanding the circumstances that led to <i>tznius</i> regulations in orthodox Judaism today can also soften the challenge of arcane dress codes at least a little bit. But I think the hopeful part of this article is the most important part. Our collective standards might be able to change if we allow them to change. In our hearts we must know that in theory our goal is to be Godly in a way that is not intended nor should it ever be interpreted as a way to control women, burden women with the brunt of dealing with man&#8217;s animalism, some new-agey feminist form of liberation, or the fundamental way women serve God.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is meant to be a way of emulating God. Let’s bring that back and try to end the current trend of fetishizing <i>tznius.</i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><i><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/torah_study.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7237" alt="torah_study" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/torah_study-300x223.jpg" width="300" height="223" /></a>“Concerning this it is told in the account of the Wars of the Lord, &#8220;What He gave at the [Sea of] Reeds and the streams of Arnon.” &#8211; Numbers 21:14</i></p>
<p>The Torah connects the miracles at the Sea of Reeds with the miracles at the streams of Arnon. We are very familiar with the splitting of the sea and the drowning of the Egyptians as the waves crashed down upon them. At the streams of Arnon, Amonites and Moabites were waiting for the Israelites and planned to ambush them. G-D saved the Israelites by crushing the soldiers lying in wait with the mountains they were using for cover. The twin peaks merged together destroying the people lying in wait. The verse tell us that these fantastic miracles are recorded in the book of the Wars of the Lord.</p>
<p>The Hebrew words for “what He gave at [the Sea of] Reeds” are “et vahev b’Sufa.” In the Talmud, our Sages ask what <i>drasha </i>we can learn from the words in Psalms (127) “et oyvim b’shaar &#8211; the enemies at the gates?” The Talmud answers in name of R’ Chiya bar Abba that even a father and son or a teacher and student that study Torah in one gateway become enemies when they argue about the Torah and they do not budge from their position until they love one another, as the verse says “et vahev b’Sufa.” Rashi explains that the Talmud is referencing the mention of the book of the Wars of the Lord and is playing on the word vahev which is similar to the word ahava &#8211; love, and is saying that the battles of Torah (the Wars of the Lord) end in love.</p>
<p>R’ Schwab asks the obvious question here. This is a very farfetched <i>drasha.</i> What possible connection could there be between the splitting of the seas, the crushing of potential ambushers by way of mountains, and the intense study of Torah with a partner?<span id="more-7236"></span></p>
<p>We can understand the teaching of the Talmud if we examine the true nature of the miracles being referenced here. There were several miracles at the Sea of Reeds, but the miracle recognized here is the demise of the Egyptians in the raging waters of the sea. The waters split for the sake of the Israelites. It was a necessary measure to save the Israelites from certain death. Once the danger passed there was no longer a need for the miracle and the miraculous forces that were keeping a dry path in the sea stopped holding the waters back. As soon as there was no force splitting the sea, the waters returned to their natural, original position and the Egyptians drowned in the crashing waters.</p>
<p>Similarly, the miracle at Nachal Arnon was the merging of two mountains to crush the enemy. In essence, says R’ Schwab, the two mountains were really one mountain with two peaks. They were supposed to be one mountain but were only two peaks for the sake of giving a path for the Israelites to pass. To crush the would-be ambush all that was required was a suspension of the miracles separating the two peaks. Once the force keeping the mountain in two parts stopped, the mountain naturally crushed the ambush.</p>
<p>When fathers and sons or teachers and students study Torah they become enemies. They take different positions on matters of great importance. They disagree on the correct understanding, message, or interpretation. They argue for their point of view and fight for their position. It looks like there is a legitimate war. But the truth is that this schism is a mirage. Their true status is a state of peace and love. It’s just that through arguing in the Battles of Torah they take positions that are at odds. Love is their natural position.</p>
<p>The Talmud is saying that the same way the waves crashing on the Egyptians and the mountains crushing the ambushers was the previously held unnatural state returning to its natural state, “et vahev b’Sufa” can refer to the natural state of love between opponents in the Battles of the Torah. Even though they appear to be at odds, they are really only temporarily arguing. Their true state is peace, love, and harmony. The <i>drasha </i>is not so farfetched after all.</p>
<p>Never in the history of the Jewish people have so many people had the opportunity to hear so many different perspectives and ideas about Judaism. Hundreds and thousands of years ago, people were exposed only to the small group of people they knew personally. Eventually, books were published with slight variances of tradition and thought but generally speaking, people knew what they knew and they did what they did. Our modern society has opened the floodgates of information. This is a great blessing. We have access to more Torah than we ever had before. But we must now contend with many more competing views of religion in general, Judaism, and Orthodox Judaism. As a group we have a lot of opinions and we are passionate about our ideas.</p>
<p>Sometimes the discussions and disagreements can get heated. After all, it is the Battle of the Torah otherwise known as the Wars of the Lord! There is so much at stake and there is so much to learn and to discuss. We all have opportunities to hear new ideas and learn from others. We also have a chance to share our perspectives and opinions. This is wonderful. But we cannot forget that despite our differences, they are only superficial. Disagreement is not our natural state. Our arguments are only for the sake of Torah and G-D. We must be sure that when our arguments end we find ourselves in our natural state of peace, love, and harmony.</p>
<p>What a poignant thought for our generation. In a world of international discussion and debate via the Internet we can never forget that when our learning is over we leave the conversation with the love of a father to a son. Certainly, in our face to face interactions, Shabbos table discussions, coffee room shmoozing, and of course learning in the Beis Medrash we always remember that it ends in our natural state of love and affection toward each other. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gérôme_Jean-Léon_-_Moses_on_Mount_Sinai_Jean-Léon_Gérôme_-1895-1900.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7234" alt="Gérôme,_Jean-Léon_-_Moses_on_Mount_Sinai_Jean-Léon_Gérôme_-1895-1900" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Gérôme_Jean-Léon_-_Moses_on_Mount_Sinai_Jean-Léon_Gérôme_-1895-1900-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a>Professor Tamar Ross was interviewed by Professor Alan Brill over at Kavvanah about Torah M&#8217;Sinai and Biblical Criticism. To be honest, when I read the interview I was unable to comprehend what she was trying to say. Only after a lengthy Facebook conversation and some posts by Gideon Slifkin did I get her approach, sort of.</p>
<p>Her words are very dense and quite cryptic but I think this what she is trying to say.</p>
<p>In her opinion, we have two immovable objects. We have Divine Revelation and the requisite belief that God gave the Torah to us in its complete form and we have Biblical Criticism which in her opinion asserts that the Torah has evolved from multiple authors and multiple eras. Something has to give. For most people, ignorance about one or the other is the turning point. People who know more about Biblical Criticism than TMS are more likely to think that the Torah is not Divine. Those who know more about (the Orthodox Jewish) approach to Torah than Biblical Criticism are more likely to think that Biblical Criticism is just a theory or soft science with more biases than religious approaches to Torah.</p>
<p>I am not here to take sides and apparently neither is Professor Ross.<span id="more-7233"></span></p>
<p>Ross&#8217;s basic idea is that &#8220;revelation&#8221; was not a one time thing. The revelation continues as the world progressed and however the Torah was emended or edited after Sinai was part of revelation. In order to make this sound religious, Professor Ross uses all kinds of fancy kabbalistic &#8220;logic&#8221; to make this approach kosher. In short, God is not bound by time so everything is really happening at once. Revelation can&#8217;t be just a moment in time and God is continually revealed through the evolution of Torah. Apparently there are allusions to this kind of theology in classical sources. Also, the thing that make our tradition unique is only that it is our tradition. I&#8217;m not sure how and why this fits in, but she does say it.</p>
<p>Read the entire interview because the bulk of it is really about what this approach is not as opposed to what this approach actually is. But what is it?</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not Orthodox. That&#8217;s for sure. But as has been pointed out, it&#8217;s not that far off. In terms of how the charedi world sees Mesorah and Daas Torah, the assumption is that God is &#8220;signing off&#8221; on the developments of Orthodox Judaism is part and parcel of how charedi Judaism works. So is it so hard to hear that God functioned the same way with regard to how the text of the Written Law evolved? Granted, the Written Law and Oral Law have different parameters and roles and I am not saying that these two ideas are the same. I am merely pointing out that the two ideas are similar.</p>
<p>Is this idea viable or useful?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. First of all, simple ideas are popular. There is a reason that more nuanced positions are less popular than bombastic theories of everything. People like when things are simple. The fundamentalist version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai is simple and not nuanced at all. It&#8217;s also pretty popular. If you want a theory to be popular it needs to be simple. Professor Ross has proposed a very complicated theory that is very difficult to articulate. It&#8217;s not going to gain much traction because of this fatal flaw.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think that an idea like this is not likely to help actual people. People who believe in the fundamentalist version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai don&#8217;t need this. People who reject Torah M&#8217;Sinai are not usually looking for creative way to believe in Torah M&#8217;Sinai. Further, I am not sure that this path will lead people who reject fundamentalist Torah M&#8217;Sinai to mitzvah observance. I think they want to do what God says to do, not what men say to do as a part of God&#8217;s slow revelation.</p>
<p>However, there are a few people in the middle who I am confident that this approach can help. Some people just want some theological basis to be orthodox and this can potentially serve that small group. If we believe in the primacy of keeping Torah and Mitzvos then we should welcome creative ways that are somewhat theologically sound to help more people accomplish this goal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/noah.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7229" alt="noah" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/noah-300x163.jpg" width="300" height="163" /></a>One of the more difficult stories in the Bible is the story of Noah and the Flood. It is confounding on several fronts.</p>
<p>The morality of the tale challenges us. The text of the narrative is confusing. The presence of competing flood narratives from the rest of the ancient world gives us pause. The paucity of scientific and archaeological evidence of a massive flood is disconcerting. Perhaps most of all, it is difficult for our modern ears to hear the relevance of the story today.</p>
<p>All the aforementioned issues can be answered with a variety of approaches. We have dealt with some of the them on this blog. (See here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/10/17/a-possible-bombshell-from-rabbi-j-h-hertz-on-the-great-flood-in-parshas-noach/" target="_blank">Flood Bombshell</a>)</p>
<p>On Tablet Magazine <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/author/mingall/">Marjorie Ingall</a> reviews a new book with a version of the flood story told as if it were an Indian scroll. Sounds cool.<span id="more-7228"></span></p>
<p>The book and its review are not relevant to me. But what I do find interesting is how Ms. Ingall find modern relevance to the story. She says that for children the story teaches the lessons of the &#8220;Peaceable Kingdom.&#8221; It&#8217;s a message that the world needs to be harmonious to exist. This is a great lesson for children. As for adults, it is a message that no matter what calamity may befall us or our children, we have hope in a better tomorrow. This is also a great lesson.</p>
<p>Why am I talking about this?</p>
<p>There are two things I want to take from her article. First, orthodox Jews have a tendency to think that we have a monopoly on <em>drush. </em>Sometimes we have a hard time remembering that non-orthodox Jews are also dealing with the challenges of the Torah and they often have great ideas that we can learn from. In this instance, making the flood story contemporary is a difficulty that we share. To be sure, there are some non-orthodox people who will dismiss the flood story as ancient literature with no lessons for today. But when they make an honest attempt to view the stories as eternal and take legitimate lessons from the story, we can incorporate them into our perspective on the story.</p>
<p>Secondly, as time passes, the stories of the Bible can begin to seem old or out of date. It is our job to find eternal meaning in these stories because they were given to us as eternal stories. There are many ways to do this. We can hyper-literalize or we can adapt our thinking or try many other ideas in between the two. There is definitely value in seeking modern lessons in ancient stories. Most importantly, these stories remain in our collective subconscious and demand that we address them. Children love the flood story. Every culture has a flood story. There has to be a reason for this and more importantly, these stories become part of our DNA. Excising the stories or rejecting the stories is to reject a part of ourselves.</p>
<p>There is something universal about the flood story. You&#8217;ll find it has appeal across the spectrum of Judaism. For example, the Skirball Center in Los Angeles has a yearly Ark Exhibit that is visited by tens of thousands of people. Most of them are not orthodox. Even our less orthodox brethren love the flood story for its many teachings and lessons. We could learn a thing or two from them on this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/disunity.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7210" alt="disunity" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/disunity.png" width="300" height="300" /></a>“Put fire therein, and put incense upon them before the Lord tomorrow; and it shall be that the man whom the Lord does choose, he shall be holy; you take too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi.”</em> &#8211; Numbers 16:7</p>
<p>In this week’s parsha, Korach challenges the legitimacy of Moses’ leadership. It was something of a suicide mission as Korach knew that if he was wrong, he would die. But why would Korach risk his life? By all accounts Korach was smart and ambitious, not a fool. What was Korach thinking?</p>
<p>Rashi quotes the Medrash that says that the “you take too much upon yourselves” can be interpreted Midrashically to mean “I have told you about a great thing.” This explains Korach’s folly. Through prophecy, Korach saw a vision that he would have very special descendants and believed that he would be spared in their merit.</p>
<p>This vision emboldened Korach and he proceeded with his rebellion with confidence that he would survive the ordeal. It was Korach’s hubris that did him in. He thought that if his descendants were righteous it gave validity to his mission. In truth, his sons repented before the ground swallowed Korach and his rebels. It was their descendants who Korach saw in his prophecy.</p>
<p>Rabbeinu Chananel says that Korach and his group were Levites. R’ Shteinman points out that this means that the sin of this group was different than the other sins of the Israelites in the desert. Starting with the sin of the Golden Calf, the Levites abstained from sin. The Levites were able to withstand the temptation of sin throughout the sojourn in the desert. Until Korach.</p>
<p>What happened? Why was Korach the Levite susceptible to sin in this instance?<span id="more-7209"></span></p>
<p>R’ Shteinman directs us to a passage in Duties of the Heart to answer this question. A sinner who repents has an advantage over a righteous person who has never sinned. A pure person without sin can become overconfident in his or her ability not to sin. One who never sinned can become so arrogant about not sinning that it could lead one to sin. However, one who sinned and repented is always on the lookout so that one will not sin again. In this respect, the sinner who repented has a leg up on the one who has never sinned.</p>
<p>To illustrate: A righteous person said to a students “If you had never sinned I would be afraid of something worse than sin for your sake.” The students asked “What could be worse than sin?” The teacher replied “Arrogance.”</p>
<p>This explains how Korach could fall despite his Levite heritage. In fact, being a Levite contributed to his susceptibility to this particular sin. This sin was a sin of hubris. Korach thought that his prophetic vision of righteous descendants vindicated his cause. This is pure arrogance. The prophetic vision was ambiguous but Korach’s overconfidence walked him down the path of destruction.</p>
<p>It is true that the Levites resisted sin in the desert. But even they were not immune to the precipitous fall that begins with hubris.</p>
<p>There are two types of sins. One type of sin is a result of overwhelming passion or irreverent apathy. These are the sins we are most well equipped to avoid. We can withstand temptation or we can simply care. But sins that are caused by arrogance are a completely different brand of sin. These are sins that are so much harder to avoid because our arrogance blinds us to the sin and then it is too late.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes. We all fail sometimes. Many of our mistakes or failures are due to poor judgment or apathy. These mistakes are egregious but the problem is fixable. However when we make mistakes because we are arrogant or overconfident, we may not even see our mistakes until they are in our rear view mirror. We don’t even see it coming.</p>
<p>The only thing worse than sin is arrogance.</p>
<p>In our existing and potential relationships we must be so careful not to allow arrogance to blind us. We are at our worst when we feel superior to others. Arrogance makes us judgmental and pushes us to be divisive. We are at our best when we realize that we have so much to learn from everyone around us. Humility makes us see others favorably and pushes us toward unity.</p>
<p>Now we come full circle. Korach was arrogant. This caused him to rebel and create division. The antidote is humility. We will achieve unity when we are able to see the good in others and acknowledge that our differences make us a stronger unit than we would be if we were all the same. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/venice.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-7191" alt="IMG_1506" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/venice-300x286.jpg" width="210" height="200" /></a>There is a Talmudic mystery that has perplexed Torah scholars for centuries.</p>
<p>Normally the Talmud is a free flowing conversation. Each new topic that is discussed is properly headed or is a segue from a previous conversation. On Sanhedrin 43A, the Talmud abruptly ends the conversation and picks up the conversation on 43B with an unrelated topic. Some scholars have offered creative suggestions that connect the two but no interpretations are sufficiently satisfactory.</p>
<p>The mystery has been already been solved. Here are 10 incredible photos of three versions of one book of the Talmud that tell the story of this mystery and its solution. Come with me on a Talmudic journey spanning 5 centuries.<span id="more-2556"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>1. Standard Edition Talmud</strong></span></p>
<p>When you look at a typical Gemara Sanhedrin and open it to the page with 42B and 43A this is what you see. Text of the Mishna and Gemara in the center and Rashi and Tosfos on the outside of the page with Rashi near the binding and Tosfos on the edges.</p>
<div><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082923_f05a9d2e76_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7172" alt="IMG_1550" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082923_f05a9d2e76_o-1024x768.jpg" width="559" height="419" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>The thing that immediately jumps out at you is all that white space under the text of 43A. The second thing that would jump out at you if you were studying this folio is that there is no apparent connection between the end of 43A and the start of 43B. For many years this bothered Talmudic scholars.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>2. Lots of White Space</strong></span></p>
<p>Here is a clearer view of just 43A. Note all the white space</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082655_b4c5dcf1e8_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7173" alt="IMG_1549" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523082655_b4c5dcf1e8_o-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>3. The Zhitomer Talmud Has the Same Problem</strong></span></p>
<p>This problem is not just a recent one. Below is a photograph of the same folio from the Zhitomer edition of the Talmud. This edition was printed in 1859. The above photos are from the Vilna edition of the Talmud that is used today and was first printed in the 1880&#8242;s. As you can see, the Zhitomer edition suffers from the same white space and as expected has the exact same text as the Vilna edition.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523718154_901d163a05_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7169" alt="IMG_1555" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523718154_901d163a05_o-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>4. A Closer View of the Zhitomer</strong></span></p>
<p>Here is a closer view of the end of the Zhitomer 43A.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523719376_cb9869ba70_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7165" alt="IMG_1559" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523719376_cb9869ba70_o-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>

<div>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>5, 6, and 7. A Volume of the Talmud almost 500 Years Old</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Here is where it gets interesting. The first printed edition of the Talmud was printed in Venice (not California) in 1549. Incredibly, some of these editions are still in circulation. My grandfather OB&#8221;M was an avid collector of antique <em>seforim</em> and owned a copy of Sanhedrin from the Venice edition of the Talmud. (He owned several Venice volumes.) Below are 3 photos of the spine of that volume.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523707200_a051d7db2f_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7187" alt="IMG_1510" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523707200_a051d7db2f_o-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523706636_ea6620d603_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7185" alt="IMG_1507" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4523706636_ea6620d603_o-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>8. The Oldest Printed Version of Sanhedrin 43A</strong></span></p>
<p>If we turn the page to 43A we notice something incredible. No white space. If we take a closer look we will see that 9 extra lines of text are present in the Venice edition. See below.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523715588_9664faaabf_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7163" alt="IMG_1545" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523715588_9664faaabf_o-768x1024.jpg" width="461" height="614" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>9. Now You Can Actually Read It</strong></span></p>
<p>Below is a readable photo of the text and you can see the content of the missing section. This section tells of a theoretical conversation between the students of Jesus and the rabbis. The tale incriminates the rabbis as the killers of Jesus and these students. The conversation is fascinating on its own but of more interest to us right now is the resolution to the mystery of Sanhedrin 43A. This section was removed at some point between 1549 and 1859. Either printers that were censored by the church removed the text or the rabbis had it removed to protect themselves from the ire of the church. In either case, it left many generations of Talmudic scholars in the dark.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082143_4f02739c22_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7162" alt="IMG_1547" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082143_4f02739c22_o-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>10. Jesus Was Hanged On Passover Eve According to These Rabbis</strong></span></p>
<p>Below you can clearly see some of the text: &#8220;On Erev Pesach they hanged him&#8221;, &#8220;He tricked and misled Israel&#8221;. This is not a reliable proof that the rabbis killed Jesus. It is not meant to be historical as it is an <em>aggadic</em> text. Further, I believe some of the facts of the story here are actually impossible to reconcile with each other</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082405_2ca444cc2b_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-7161" alt="IMG_1548" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4523082405_2ca444cc2b_o-1024x768.jpg" width="614" height="461" /></a></p>
<p>Mystery solved! The old editions of the Talmud tell us the story of Sanhedrin 43A. Of course, this mystery has not been solved by me, this stuff is pretty well known and available in other formats. I just think it is even more amazing to see it in action. Now you have seen the evidence.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dore_Return_of_the_Spies_From_the_Land_of_Promise.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7158" alt="Dore_Return_of_the_Spies_From_the_Land_of_Promise" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Dore_Return_of_the_Spies_From_the_Land_of_Promise-238x300.jpg" width="238" height="300" /></a>In Parshas Shlach, Moshe sends the spies to the Land of Israel. Just prior to their departure the Torah tells us that Moses called Hoshea bin Nun Yehoshua. The common reading of the verse is that Moses changed Hoshea&#8217;s name to Yehoshua. No reason is given in the text of the Chumash for this change.</p>
<p>The Talmud in Sota (34b) famously tells us that Moses &#8220;<em>said &#8211; Yud Hey [the name of God] will save you from the plot of the spies</em>.&#8221; I think most people understand this interpretation of Chazal as saying that Moses had a premonition about the mission from the start. He somehow knew that they were going to sin. To protect Hoshea from sin Moses added God&#8217;s name to Hoshea so that he would be saved from their scheme.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah asks the obvious questions here. First, if Moses knew about the plot how could he send them to sin? Second, the best he could muster was a name change for Hoshea? If he knew they were going to sin he should have offered protection for all of them!</p>
<p>Because of these questions the Torah Temimah reinterprets what Chazal are saying here.<span id="more-7156"></span> He says that he Moses actually thought that the plot was going to come from Hoshea. This is because Hoshea was from the family of Joseph. Joseph had a history of Lashon Hara from the incidents with his brothers back in Parshas Vayeshev. So Moses thought the best solution was to cut off the problem at its head. If Joseph&#8217;s progeny would not concoct the plan, the spies would be safe.</p>
<p>What of Gadi ben Susi? He was also from the family of Joseph?</p>
<p>Answers the Torah Temimah that it could be that Hoshea was more beloved to Moses because he was his student and also because he would be the one to bring the people to Israel and Moses was understandably more concerned with his fate. Whereas with Gadi Moses was less concerned because it was a far-fetched concern anyway.</p>
<p>Then the Torah Temimah tells us that the actual blessing given to Hoshea was not that &#8220;Yud Hey [the name of God] will save you from the plot of the spies.&#8221; Rather, Moses simply said &#8220;God should save you from bad ideas&#8221; and it was just Chazal who editorialized the blessing in light of what actually ended up happening.</p>
<p>In other words, Moses preferred to give the blessing to his close student because he was human after all and human nature is to care more about people who are close to us. Further, Moses did not know the spies were going to sin. He was nervous about his student because of his family history. But Moses did not predict the future here. He was more like a concerned Jewish father figure.</p>
<p>I think this is improves on the standard way we learned this statement of Chazal as children. It makes the characters more complex and more human. It runs counter to the current trend of deifying our Biblical and contemporary heroes. The Torah Temimah approach resonates more deeply with me and I have a hunch it is worth reintroducing into our Torah discourse.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4590176018_086a2de7ab_o.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7149" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/4590176018_086a2de7ab_o-300x227.jpg" width="300" height="227" /></a>“And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.” &#8211; Number 14:1</em></p>
<p>Upon hearing the negative report of the spies about the Land of Canaan, the Israelites were forlorn. They believed they would have no chance of conquering the land and so they wept. The Talmud tells us in the name of Rabbi Yochanan that the night they wept was the 9th of Av. God told the Israelites that they cried for no reason on 9th of Av in the desert so God would give them a real reason to cry in the future. It seems that our first and second temples were destroyed on the 9th of Av as retribution for the communal sin of the spies and their slander.</p>
<p>The Book of Lamentations wails over the destruction of the first temple. According to the Talmud it also hints at the reasons for the destruction. Each of the first four chapters of the book forms an acrostic with the first letter of each sentence forming the Hebrew alphabet. In the Hebrew alphabet the letter Ayin precedes the letter Peh. However, the verse in Lamentations chapter 1 beginning with the letter Peh precedes the verse beginning with the letter Ayin. This is because the Peh, which can also refer to the mouth, jumped ahead of the Ayin, which can also refer to the eye. The spies spoke about things that their eyes did not see and so the Peh precedes the Ayin in Lamentations to allude to the sin that caused the destruction of the temple.</p>
<p>There is a problem with this interpretation.<span id="more-7148"></span> The problem is that it seems from the Talmud that the sin of the spies related to saying something with their mouths that they did not see. That’s a very normal way Lashon Hara, evil speech, is spread. But according to the text of the story, the spies merely reported what they actually did see. They saw a land that swallows its inhabitants. They saw giants. They even brought huge fruits as souvenirs. The spies editorialized a bit, yet we would never say that they spoke about what they did not see. How does this teaching of the Talmud fit in with the facts of the story from the text of the Book of Numbers?</p>
<p>Rabbi Shimon Schwab offers a beautiful explanation. R’ Schwab says that people see things the way that they alone see them. In other words, our personality, attitude, feelings, and experience color what our eyes see. Two people can look at the same thing and one can see spiritual beauty and the other can see physical beauty. Or two people can look at the same thing and one can see something ugly and the other can see something beautiful. It’s a matter of perspective and perception.</p>
<p>Take someone who knows nothing about the Jewish people or the history of Israel and show them the Kotel. That person will see rocks. Big rocks. And a wall. But take a person with an appreciation for its holiness and that person will see the grandeur of the Kotel as a place of worship and spirituality. It all depends on the person who is looking.</p>
<p>Similarly, the spies went to the Land of Canaan. They could have seen its inherent spiritual beauty. They could have seen the incredible opportunities for religious life and personal growth present in the land. But their eyes were not tuned into those things. The spies were only able to see the land with material vision. They could only appreciate the physical attributes of the land. They saw death and giants and large produce. They did not see the spiritual value of the land. The spies should have seen the Divine Presence on Mount Moriah. They should have felt the holiness of Hebron. But they did not. Why? Because they were using their eyes that were focused only on material things, not spiritual reality.</p>
<p>This explains why the Peh preceded the Ayin. The mouth spoke what the eyes did not see. The eyes should have seen a land of holiness and spirituality. The mouth spoke what it did not see. The mouth spoke of physical flaws and challenges. The spiritual eyes of the spies were closed and they did not see what they should have seen. This was the cause of their demise.</p>
<p>Every situation in our lives and in the public discourse has at least one way of looking at it. The way one sees something is influenced by their personality, experience, and feelings. Although we may be convinced our way is the correct way there is always another way to look at the same facts and draw different conclusions.</p>
<p>This is an important lesson in a global community. We live in a world where people with varied life experiences and environments, thus we are bound to see the same things through different lenses. Understanding that we can see the same things as another person and arrive at completely different conclusions is necessary in our modern world.</p>
<p>We must take the lesson of the spies and use the right glasses to see things the right way. But we also must understand that when others see things differently than we do, often it is because they are different people with a different pair of glasses. Knowing this, we can take steps to further our understanding and appreciation of others and their ideas bringing us closer to a day of peace among all inhabitants of the earth. Good Shabbos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mount_sinai_2_2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-7095 alignleft" alt="mount_sinai_2_2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/mount_sinai_2_2.jpg" width="312" height="258" /></a>Shavuos is upon us. In our times, the holiday is celebrated as the time we received the Holy Torah at Mount Sinai. The day is a day of Torah. Many have the custom to learn through the night in anticipation of the morning which we commemorate the revelation at Sinai. Extended Torah study is an excellent way to celebrate Shavuos.</p>
<p>To me, the most poignant element of <em>ma&#8217;amad Har Sinai</em> comes before the revelation. The Torah tells us that the Jewish people camped around the mountain. The world used to describe this encampment is the word <em>va&#8217;yichan</em>. We would expect that the word would be <em>va&#8217;yichanu</em>, in the plural tense. Instead we get<em> va&#8217;yichan</em>, in the singular tense. Rashi quotes the famous Midrashic interpretation that the Jewish people were united as one in their preparation for receiving the Torah. Since the people were &#8220;one&#8221; the Torah uses a singular tense to describe their encampment.</p>
<p>The message is loud and clear. We are being told that there can be no <em>matan Torah</em> without unity.<span id="more-7094"></span></p>
<p>Thus, every year we hope to renew our covenant with God and Torah on Shavuos, but first we must fulfill the prerequisite of unity to have a chance at accepting the Torah.</p>
<p>In addition to our unity, it seems there was a unity of nature and supernature at the same time. <em>Chazal</em> tell us that the birds stopped chirping, the animals were quiet, even the Angels were silent. The seas were calm, people all over the word held their tongues. The entire world was waiting in absolute unity for God to share the Torah with the world.</p>
<p>To me, universal silence represents each person, each being, each element of nature listening as it were, to the word of God. When we are talking, when we are active, when we are not silent, we are unable to hear anything from the outside. In order to listen, in order to hear, we need to be silent.</p>
<p>In order to achieve true unity and to accept the Torah we need to be silent. We need to hear what is being said. We need to open our eyes and open our hearts to connect with one another and become one.</p>
<p>Unity means different things to different people. Some people think it means that we all need to agree. Some people think it means tolerance of others and acceptance of those who are within a certain accepted boundary. Some people think it must include everyone, even those you believe are truly evil or wrong.</p>
<p>To me, unity means listening to everyone. It means giving everyone an opportunity to be heard, even our opponents. Unity means trying to find common ground and focus on the things we can agree upon. It means choosing our battles wisely so that we can create positive feelings toward one another.</p>
<p>We have been through a lot over the last few weeks and months as a nation. Sometimes we get contentious toward one another. Often our disagreements are passionate and can get heated. We are all trying to do what is right.</p>
<p>As we approach Shavuos it is incumbent upon us to emulate our forefathers and come together as one in preparation of renewing our relationship to God and the Torah. We also must practice effective silence. We need to listen to one another. We need to hear each other. We need to create opportunities for dialogue and conversation.</p>
<p>We all want to merit the crown of Torah. Let us take these lessons and make them a part of our collective lives. Let us find the strength of unity and silence and we will find a Torah that connects us all to one another and to the Almighty.</p>
<p>Happy Shavuos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/15246_4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7068" alt="15246_4" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/15246_4-300x232.jpg" width="300" height="232" /></a>This week I was in filming my father&#8217;s school in Monsey, Ateres Bais Yaakov, for their annual dinner. I always swell with pride as I get an intimate look at this incredible school. It is remarkable how much the students love their school, their teachers, Torah, and learning.</p>
<p>One of the highlights for me is always observing (and filming) a high school Chumash class. At Ateres, the girls are challenged to actively participate in their learning and ask questions during class.</p>
<p>In particular, Chumash is not so much taught, as it is learned. The students rigorously and precisely translate the words of the text, analyze the text for grammatical or other anomalies, and compile a list of questions for each verse. Only once that task is complete does the teacher begin to introduce the commentaries and interpretations of the great medieval commentators.</p>
<p>In this way, the various ways of learning the verse are not simply abstract interpretive choices made by great Torah scholars, rather they are solutions to problems in the text which give way to novel and illuminating interpretations. This is how the Rishonim learned Chumash. They were masters of diction and grammar. When they read a verse, they knew if the verse was rendered perfectly or if it needed interpretation. They knew all of this because, of course, they were experts in Biblical language and grammar. That expertise formed the basis for all their interpretations.</p>
<p><span id="more-7067"></span></p>
<p>i think it is great that young women are learning Chumash in the same manner as our rishonim. It was also really enjoyable to be a fly on the wall for a class like this and that is what got me thinking.</p>
<p>In my yeshiva high school we were responsible to learn the parsha every week and we were tested on Chumash with Rashi every Sunday. This way we all became familiar with the storyline and mitzvos in the Torah while also learning the most well known commentary. To me, it was a way to learn information. What does the Torah say and what does that mean? But we learned no skills (unless zipping through the Birnbaum Chumash with Rashi in English in 30 minutes and scoring a 95 on the test is a skill) and we did not get an appreciation for why Rashi chose the interpretations in his commentary. Nor were we acutely aware that there are many other equally valid interpretations on each verse in the Chumash. Certainly we had no ability to explain why each commentary chose its interpretation over the other.</p>
<p>Yet, at least in this high school, the girls are learning all of that. I mentioned this to R&#8217; Gil Student at our little <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101527642993025" target="_blank">Asifa</a> in Manhattan and he told me that he learned Chumash the way the Bais Yaakov girls learn Chumash in his left wing modern orthodox high school. (He also said that half his classmates are not orthodox today.) I can&#8217;t speak for modern orthodox high schools. But I can speak for yeshivos. The most rigorous Chumash curriculum mirrors my experience. Unfortunately, I think most yeshivos have far less Chumash learning that what I experienced.</p>
<p>I think we need to work on this. I think that we have a lot to gain by teaching Chumash the way <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/06/book-review-dovbear-on-the-parsha/" target="_blank">Dov Bear</a> and <a href="http://parsha.blogspot.com" target="_blank">R&#8217; Josh Waxman</a> approach Chumash. We need to cultivate the skills necessary and an appreciation for true Chumash study.</p>
<p>Learning Chumash the way our ancestors learned Chumash requires a working knowledge of grammar, an open forum to ask questions, and a little bit of reprogramming about our Mesorah. Those are all good things. As a side benefit I think this will help us meet some of the challenges presented by modern scholarship.</p>
<p>At the very least, every kollel guy should have a seder with his wife where she teaches him Chumash the way she learned it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sadducees.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7040" alt="sadducees" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sadducees-264x300.jpg" width="264" height="300" /></a>It is a commonly held belief in the orthodox Jewish community that the Sadducees and the Karaites are basically the same thing. The Sadducees, along with other sectarians, challenged the Pharisees and their interpretations of the Written Torah.</p>
<p>However, as I hope to explore a bit in a post sometime soon, they had their own Oral Traditions and methodology. It was a close cousin to the Pharisees and they did not disagree on all that much nor was there a very wide berth separating the groups. There was even some cross-pollination and we will see in that future post.</p>
<p>The Karaites came on the scene 800 years later. The Sadducees were long gone and the only group that was left standing from the tumultuous Second Temple Period were the Pharisees. While in some small ways, one can trace Karaite theology to some aspects of sectarian Second Temple movements, there was likely no continued, unbroken chain connected them to sectarians.</p>
<p><span id="more-7038"></span></p>
<p>This has been debated in academic circles for a while now and I don&#8217;t intend on resolving the debate in this post although I lean toward the side that says that Karaites started from scratch in the 9th century as a response to Islam.</p>
<p>Either way, it has become accepted wisdom in orthodox Judaism that Karaites are very similar to Sadducees and the terms are used interchangebly. I may have found an early source for this confusion. In his commentary on the Mishna in Avos, Maimonides says that Antignos Ish Socho taught that we should not do Mitzvos in anticipation of reward. Maimonides quotes the Avos D&#8217;Rabbi Nosson and writes that Tzadok and Bytus took this to mean that there is no reward in the next world and thereby launched their respective sectarian groups of the Sadducees (Tzadokim) and Boethusians (Bytusim). Maimonides continues and says that these groups survived to this very day (12th century) and are now called Karaites.</p>
<p>It seems that Maimonides lumps them together. This might be a mistake or just a clumsy way of grouping similar groups together. In truth, they are not so similar. Karaites would reject the Sadducee interpretations of the Torah as much as they would deny the truth of Pharisee interpretations. It&#8217;s imprecise to lump them together in an academic sense. Perhaps it makes sense to lump them together in a religious sense.</p>
<p>I think that this note by Maimonides could be one of the reasons rabbinic orthodox Judaism now fails to distinguish between the two groups. I would prefer precision for the sake of accuracy and truth. But more importantly, there is a lot we can learn about contemporary Judaism by looking at these groups and we can only even begin to do this if we have our terminology correct. Now that we do, I hope to continue exploring the relationship between the Pharisees and Sadducees in my next post on this topic. Hopefully tomorrow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7033" alt="library-books" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books-298x300.jpg" width="298" height="300" /></a>There are several dozen prohibitions in the Torah that relate to idol worship. Writing in the 12th century, Maimonides stridently warns against studying the texts of idolatry or even learning about idol worship. (Hilchos Avodas Kochavim 2:2)</p>
<p>The argument against interfacing with idol worship is that the human mind is drawn towards the things that one studies. One is not always in perfect control of what one thinks and what one wants. So even if one is studying for the sake of satisfying curiosity, or even learning to rebut, one may be drawn toward idol worship. Maimonides extends this law to include heresy as well.</p>
<p>This is all kinds of depressing. Under this view, it can be extremely dangerous to study anything one does not already believe because whatever one studies for whatever reason can have a very negative influence. While it might be interesting to debate or dispute this assumption, I think there is a great positive lesson to be learned as well.<span id="more-7032"></span></p>
<p>If we are drawn toward the &#8220;wrong&#8221; things by studying them, we can also be drawn to the &#8220;right&#8221; things by studying them. If we want to be more drawn to our Judaism, we can jumpstart ourselves by studying Torah. It doesn&#8217;t have to be anything specific, it can be anything. I think a lot of people study things that they don&#8217;t enjoy and that causes them to want to study less. We would be wise to broaden the scope of what we study as a collective unit and give more people more opportunities to find things they enjoy studying. One doesn&#8217;t have to study the familiar texts. Study whatever Jewish texts you want. It seems that when one learns about anything, one is drawn toward that thing. We want to be more drawn to our Judaism. Let&#8217;s study.</p>
<p>Studying Torah is valuable for so many reasons. This just seems like another side benefit.</p>
<p>This is the most important thing we can do to keep ourselves, children, and communities on the path of Judaism. Study. We are the People of the Book and it is our duty to study and know the Book. Judaism requires us to be knowledgeable. But learning about Judaism seems like good advice anyway, even for people who are already quite observant. We should study things that we want to be drawn toward. Study Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6936" alt="baby" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby-300x294.png" width="300" height="294" />The beginning of Parshas Tazria instructs the Jewish people on commandments that relate to matters of childbirth. One law sates that a woman who gives birth is ritually impure for seven days if she bears a son and fourteen days if she bears a daughter.</p>
<p>The Torah does not tell us why there is a difference between the days of ritual impurity for a son and a daughter. Naturally, this led our great rabbis to speculate and provide their own insights into these laws. Inevitably these commentaries will reflect the social and scientific norms of their milieu.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to track the development of these ideas.</p>
<p>Two general categories of interpretations are given to explain the discrepancy between the days of impurity for a son and a daughter. One category goes the social route and the other goes the medical route.<span id="more-6935"></span></p>
<p>The social route generally considers sons to be a great blessing and daughters to be a bit of a curse. Rabbi Josh Waxman has a great example of one medieval commentator who takes this tack (see: <a href="http://parsha.blogspot.com/2013/04/guys-rule-in-tazria.html">Guys rule in Tazria</a>). One can see hints of this sort of thinking in the Talmud as well. Boys earned money for the family while girls were a financial strain on the ancient family. Thus, it follows that there would be a longer period of ritual impurity for a daughter because it was less joyous. I&#8217;m not sure how this actually works logically, but you do see this line of thinking.</p>
<p>The medical route considers the birth of a son to be easier or to expel less blood or that girls are born &#8220;cooler&#8221; so the mother needs longer to heal because coolness causes illness or that boys are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 40 days and girls are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 80 days. These are ideas found in the Rishonim to explain the double waiting time for a daughter.</p>
<p>None of these reasons would satisfy the modern reader of the Chumash. No matter how &#8220;frum&#8221; one may be, these explanations don&#8217;t work anymore. Either because girls no longer cost more than boys, or because daughters are not considered a curse. Further, we know that the medicine found in these interpretations is incorrect as well.</p>
<p>Artscroll, which is by and large very traditionalist in their interpretations, shies away from these ancient commentaries as well. They are almost forced to pluck a beautiful idea from a very unlikely source to give some sort of explanation here. Artscroll quotes R&#8217; Dovid Tzvi Hoffman (late 19th century) who says that really the appropriate amount of days would be fourteen days. But since we want the mother of the child to attend the Bris Milah the Torah subtracts some time from the ritual impurity and knocks it down to seven days so that she will be able to participate in her son&#8217;s entering of the covenant.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Hoffman&#8217;s answer is lovely. But it is not found in earlier commentaries. The reason for that is because up until recently, the other interpretations were plausible. Once those interpretations became anachronistic, another interpretation was needed. R&#8217; Hoffman provides one such interpretation. Artscroll is written for 21st century Jews. They wisely choose the newer, more modern interpretation for their publication.</p>
<p>The beginning of the parsha also features some ancient science on conception. The verse says that a &#8220;woman who seeds a seed a births a son.&#8221; The implication is that the son is born because because the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221;. The Talmud explains that when the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a son. When the man &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a daughter. Ramban explains that the woman&#8217;s blood meets the man&#8217;s semen and they are the two ingredients that form the child. Whichever is &#8220;first&#8221; determines the gender. With this (wrong) medical explanation, the verse makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Ramban also brings the Greek version of conception which is different and has nothing to do with who is first. So he then explains how the verse is rendered if one holds like the Greeks! Ramban says that the word simply means seed in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>What are we to make of all this?</p>
<p>First of all, we see several examples of interpretations from ancient times that no longer work today. We are forced to abandon these commentaries and seek out newer commentaries. More importantly, it means that the ancient commentaries were based on conventional wisdom of their times. They did the best they could with what they had available to them. But their commentaries were not infallible. Particularly in areas of matters that are flux we cannot avoid the conclusion that they made mistakes and that their science or social conventions were not Divine.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think we see that even Ramban himself wasn&#8217;t so sure that Chazal were right about conception. He quotes the Greeks and gives a less elegant interpretation of the verse to reconcile their view. What does this mean? It means that when science buttresses up against the words of a verse, we are forced to reconcile the verse using creative interpretations. That must be allowed. After all the Ramban did just that. Today we are faced with similar challenges. Sometimes the old, simpler interpretations no longer work. What would Ramban do? He would reinterpret. But who among us has the shoulders of Ramban? Anyone? No one?</p>
<p>It is possible that the next Ramban is in our midst today. But with our somewhat stifling manner of Chumash study which hardly allows for innovation and reinterpretation, how will our Ramban ever show himself? Or perhaps she is a she? Who knows? One thing is clear, we don&#8217;t learn or teach Chumash the same way our ancestors learned Chumash. Instead we teach Chumash <em>the way our ancestors taught it.</em> I think we can do better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6919" alt="A-7-toward-A-8" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A-7-toward-A-8-300x203.jpg" width="300" height="203" />It&#8217;s amazing how often I can be talking with someone about Rambam and they are surprised when I tell them that it seems to me that Maimonides rejected mysticism. I am almost certain of it and I can show how it is a very nearly impossible presumption to disprove. But greater minds than mine have either doubted or rejected this claim so I try to keep an open mind.</p>
<p>There are four typical responses when people first hear that Rambam rejected mysticism:</p>
<p>1) It&#8217;s not true. They&#8217;ll quote the Brisker Rav who supposedly said that every line in the Moreh Nevuchim is based on 100 lines in the Zohar. Or the the Lubavitch view that Rambam was such a deep writer that it only appears to be &#8220;nigleh&#8221; but really it&#8217;s all nistar.</p>
<p>2) Nebach, Rambam never had a chance to learn real kabbalah because he was isolated. But if he did, he would have been a mystic for sure.</p>
<p>3) Of course Rambam held of mysticism, he just did not anything mystical in his books for some reason. [Insert reason]
<p>4) That&#8217;s cool. Tell me more.</p>
<p>I teach a Rambam class on Sunday mornings.<span id="more-6904"></span> We just learn Mishneh Torah and I provide insights based on the commentaries and my own personal experiences. From time to time, we learn a law in the text that reaffirms the rationalistic tendencies of Rambam. Here is an example.</p>
<p>מי שנידוהו בחלום אפילו ידע מי נידהו צריך עשרה בני אדם ששונין הלכות להתירו מנידויו ואם לא מצא טורח אחריהם עד פרסא לא מצא מתירים לו אפילו עשרה ששונים משנה לא מצא מתירין לו עשרה שיודעים לקרות בתורה לא מצא מתירין לו אפילו עשרה שאינן יודעין לקרות לא מצא במקומו עשרה מתירין לו אפילו שלשה.</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means if someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication. If he can&#8217;t find 10 people he should walk up to a <em>parsa</em> to find the requisite number of people.</p>
<p>From where does Rambam get this law? From the Talmud.</p>
<p>(אמר רב יוסף: נידוהו בחלום, צריך עשרה בני אדם להתיר לו.והוא דתנו הלכתא; אבל מתנו ולא תנו, לא. ואי ליכא דתנו הלכתא, אפילו מתנו ולא תנו.ואי ליכא, ליזיל וליתב אפרשת דרכים, ויהיב שלמא לבי עשרה, עד דמקלעי ליה עשרה דגמרי הלכתא. (נדרים ח א</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means that someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication, if he can&#8217;t find 1o people he should wait at the פרשת דרכים &#8211; junction &#8211; until he finds enough people.</p>
<p>The medieval commentators explain why he should go to the junction. Some say that he should greet everyone who he sees with a Shalom Aleichem and they will reply Aleichem Shalom. This will protect him from the apparent decree that has been decided against him as shown by the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>This interpretation assumes that the blessing of Aleichem Shalom actually protects someone. This is a mystical idea.</p>
<p>Rambam is uncomfortable with this idea. So either he uses a variant text (I have not seen any manuscripts with this text) or he changes the words פרשת דרכים to the word פרסא. They sound similar, but they have completely different meanings in this context. If you go with the concept found in the Talmud you are relying on mysticism to &#8220;keep you safe&#8221; until you can properly nullify the dreamy excommunication. If you go with Rambam&#8217;s version, it&#8217;s just a limitation on how far one must go to find people to nullify the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the explanation for this law in the Mishneh Torah has nothing to do with mysticism and rationalism? Sure. But the most elegant explanation is that Rambam made a conscious choice to excise this mystical idea from his book of law. Especially when you consider this example among the mountains of other similar instances.</p>
<p>All this means is that Rambam seems to have made an effort to be as rationalist as possible in the Mishneh Torah. Further conclusions are conjecture. Personally, when I see 100 signs telling me to go one direction, I figure that I should go in that direction. To me it seems that Rambam theologically rejected mysticism in every instance possible.</p>

It was a good choice. As usual, I will review and also discuss some of the parts of the book I found most interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius</a> is as much a biography of the Vilna Gaon as it is an examination of the Gaon&#8217;s milieu. Stern compares and contrasts the Gaon with central figures from history and his contemporaries in an effort to paint a more complete picture of the Gaon. It seems that Stern is trying to portray the Gaon as a bit of a reformer who can be associated with modern orthodox Judaism as opposed to modern haredi Judaism.</p>
<p>Honestly, after reading the book I was not convinced of this. It sounds almost ridiculous and the book does not provide a compelling enough case to change my mind. But it was a valiant effort. In this respect the book was a failure. However <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300179308/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0300179308&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Genius</a> is a monumental success so many other ways that the thesis of the book is almost an irrelevant side show.</p>
<p>One interesting side show was the discussion of the centrality of Creation Ex Nihilo. According to Stern, the Gaon held that there was no creation from nothing, rather all creation was from &#8220;something eternal&#8221;. This goes to the phenomena of certain interpretations gaining popularity and the rest of the interpretations becoming dinosaurs. The Gaon disagreed with Rambam on Creation Ex Nihilo and I never even heard about it. Fascinating.<span id="more-6823"></span></p>
<p>My favorite chapter in the book compared and contrasted the Gaon and Moses Mendelsohn. Most people assume that Mendelsohn was a reformer and the Gaon was a traditionalist. In some ways that is true. But as far as the way they interpreted the Torah in their commentaries, Mendelsohn expressed much greater deference to Chazal than the Gaon. In his Biur, Mendelsohn argued in favor of Rabbinical interpretations of the Torah in order to distinguish Judaism from the Christian neighbors to his fellow German Jews. Emancipation from the Ghetto brought on challenges of debating and dealing with Christian scholars. Thus, his greatest weapon was to argue for the Rabbinic tradition. The Gaon was cloistered in Vilna. There were no theological challenges from Christians. The challenges were different. The Gaon gave his own interpretations to verses where he didn&#8217;t want to go with the interpretation of Chazal.</p>
<p>The Rashbam is known to disregard many of Chazal&#8217;s interpretations. Mendelsohn was very wary of the Rashbam. He didn&#8217;t like. The Gaon loved the Rashbam and used the Rashbam&#8217;s methodology even where the Rashbam himself did not. The Gaon had no problem saying that Deuteronomy was prophesied by Moses, as opposed to dictated at Sinai, while Mendelsohn would not even concede that the last 8 verses in the Torah were written by Joshua.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Gaon encouraged a translation of Euclid into Hebrew where Mendelsohn translated the Torah into German. Both men were influenced by their social conditions. In the end, this made Mendelsohn into an apologist and the Gaon into a relevant leader.</p>
<p>I posted an excerpt of the book on Facebook. It generated a lot of discussion there so I will direct you there for the comments. (Here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101421218867825" target="_blank">Facebook.com</a>) The excerpt contrasts the Gaon&#8217;s defiant stance against Hasidut and ambivalence toward the Haskala. This is further reflected by his rabbinic legacy in R&#8217; Chaim Volozhin and the Netziv who accepted on the fence <em>maskilim</em> into the Volozhiner Yeshiva. Much of the Gaon&#8217;s opposition to Hasidut was based on the fairly recent memory of Shabtai Tzvi. But the Gaon did not have a problem with the Ramchal and R&#8217; Yonason Eybeshutz who were rumored Shabatean sympathizers. His problem was the movement of Hasidut.</p>
<p>What I find most interesting is that contemporary Hasidic movements want to include the Gaon in their worldview and sometimes reinterpret or apologize for the Gaon. It&#8217;s hard to take these ideas seriously when one has the full picture of the Gaon&#8217;s approach to Hasidut.</p>
<p>Although the Gaon was a great kabbalist, it seems that he was not a mystic in the sense that he would not emphasize or rely upon modern miracles or stories of fantastic occurrences. Some like to attribute his greatness to a magical ability or a special soul. The Gaon&#8217;s students taught that the Gaon was a self made man. Anyone could be the Gaon. He had no gifts or supernatural abilities. His greatness came from his dedication and commitment to Torah and study. His intense discipline and anti-social tendencies opened the doors to greatness. Not something that was given to him from on High. Further, Stern argues that he rejected the Daas Torah model that was made popular by the Chasam Sofer.</p>
<p>In the end, the book is an excellent read.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6803" alt="Ravschwab1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Ravschwab1-193x300.png" width="193" height="300" />With all the excitement about R&#8217; Hershel Schachter&#8217;s comments last week, some discussion about the role of the lay people as critics of the rabbinic leadership has ensued. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, R&#8217; Shimon Schwab in Parshas Vayikra has an interesting, and particularly relevant thought on Torah leaders being criticized by their followers.</p>
<p>The verse says (JPS) <em>&#8220;When a ruler sinneth, and doeth through error any one of all the things which the LORD his God hath commanded not to be done, and is guilty: if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, be known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without blemish.&#8221; (Leviticus 4:22-23)</em></p>
<p>Rashi comments on the choice of language in the verse. The verse says &#8220;אִשֶׁר&#8221; - &#8221;when a ruler sinneth&#8221; and we would expect it to say &#8220;if a ruler sinneth&#8221; like it says previously with regard to the sin of a High Priest. Why? Rashi quotes the Toras Kohanim and says that the word is אִשֶׁר because it is reminiscent of the word אַשְׁרֵי &#8211; &#8220;fortunate.&#8221; Thus, &#8220;Fortunate is the generation whose leader [does not hold himself too high, but rather,] gives attention to bringing an atonement offering for his unintentional sins-and how much more will he experience remorse for the sins he has committed willfully!&#8221; (Translation of Rashi via Judaica Press).<span id="more-6802"></span></p>
<p>Rav Schwab quotes the Talmud in Chagiga 14A, <em>(translation via Soncino).</em> <em>&#8220;When R. Dimi came, he said: Eighteen curses did Isaiah pronounce upon Israel, yet he was not pacified until he pronounced upon them this verse: The child shall behave insolently against the aged, and the base against the honorable.&#8221; </em>The Talmud explains the verse: <em>Those persons who are empty of good deeds shall behave insolently against such as are filled with good deeds as a pomegranate with seeds. &#8216;And the base against the honorable&#8217;: to those to whom weighty [precepts] appear as light ones will come and behave insolently against those to whom light [precepts] appear as weighty ones.</em></p>
<p>In other words, Isaiah cursed the Jewish people with 18 curses. But that didn&#8217;t placate him. The only thing that calmed him down was this final idea, really two curses, that things would be so bad that the leaders would be severely criticized by people completely unworthy of making that criticism.</p>
<p>Rav Schwab asks, did Isaiah hate his fellow Jews? Eighteen curses weren&#8217;t enough? He needed two more? Isaiah needed to add insult to injury? And what about these last two curses made him feel better anyway?</p>
<p>Rav Schwab explains, that Isaiah&#8217;s prophecy here was that there would be a time where the unworthy, younger generation will have complaints against their elders and they will come to the carriers of Torah and lodge their complaints, and even the complainers will severely lacking in Mitzvos, still the criticisms will be lodged against the Torah leaders of the generation and raise their voice loudly when revealing a flaw in the acts of those leaders.</p>
<p>This is what comforted Isaiah. Even thought the situation will be disastrous following 18 curses the Torah leaders will be forced to be deliberate in their actions so that their mistakes will not be disclosed by the lesser worthy people who are lacking in righteousness. Isaiah can take comfort in this. The leaders may err, but there will always be followers to speak up when that happens.</p>
<p>The Talmud in Rosh Hashana (25B) similarly states &#8220;Praiseworthy is the generation where the great ones listen to the lesser ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is what Rashi was referencing. A generation is fortunate when its leaders are able to recognize that they are mistaken. This comes from their followers who despite their sins and weaknesses criticize their leaders when necessary.</p>
<p>Seems appropriate considering the state of affairs in orthodox Judaism in general and in particular how our leadership is dealing with sexual abuse. Sometimes our leaders need the people beneath them to criticize them. Isaiah felt like that was a good thing according to Rav Schwab. I humbly agree.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</address>
<h2>Parshas Vayechi<br />
Golus Gold is Fool&#8217;s Gold</h2>
<p>Each year at this time we read of Bnai Yisrael’s impending golus. Each event from the sale of Yosef into Mitzrayim until Yaakov Avinu’s arrival and subsequent death in Egypt is a pattern of history which we have, sadly, followed all too often. One interesting attitude regarding <i>golus</i> and all of its impact is thrice repeated by Chazal and found in Parshas Vayigash, Vayechi, as well as, in Sefer Shmos. Its implicit message is profound</p>
<p>Following Yaakov Avinu’s <i>petirah</i> Yosef tells Pharaoh that he must bury his father (Yaakov) in Eretz Yisrael. Indeed, Yosef explains to the Egyptian monarch, that his father, Yaakov, made him swear (50:5) that he would bury him (Yaakov) in the grave “<em>asher karisi li b’Eretz Canaan</em>.” Chazal are puzzled by this unusual term of “<em>karisi li</em>” and offer many explanations as to its meaning. Amongst a number of <i>pshatim</i>, Rashi quotes one <i>man d’amar</i> which explains that Yaakov informed Yosef that he had purchased the right to be buried in <em>Me’aras Hamachpaila</em> from his brother Eisav. Sometime after his return to Eretz Yisrael, Yaakov took all the money he earned in the house of Lavan and gave it to Eisav as payment. Yaakov wanted to be sure there would be no argument after his death regarding the rights to this coveted burial plot. He paid for it just to be sure.</p>
<p>However there is an important detail in these words of Chazal which cannot be overlooked.<span id="more-6718"></span> The Midrash says that the money he used to purchase his burial plot came form the assets he accumulated while working in Lavan’s home. In parshas Vayigash, this Midrash is at the heart of a vital <i>yesod</i> taught to us in Rashi. The posuk (46:6) states <i>vayikchu es mikneihem v’es richusham asher rachashi b’eretz Canaan vayavoa Mitzrayma</i>. Rashi wonders what are we to learn from the fact that the <i>posuk</i> specifically states that Yaakov and his sons took they assets they acquired in Eretz Canaan with them to Egypt. On the spot, Rashi quotes the aforementioned Midrash and adds a twist. He says that Yaakov Avinu declared “<i>nichasei chutz laAretz einan kidai li</i>!” The assets I amassed in <i>golus</i> are inappropriate for me. Only the monies I acquired while in Eretz Yisrael have real value! As such, Yaakov gave all the money he earned in the house of Lavan to Eisav in order to guarantee the right of burial in <i>Me’aras Hamachpeilah</i>. Only the assets earned in Eretz Yisrael were brought down with his family to Mitzrayim.</p>
<p>This message cannot be overlooked. Yaakov Avinu, the one who risked his life in Parshas Vayishlach for <i>pachim ktanim</i> – small jars, wanted to take nothing from the Golus with him. Better to give it away. Indeed, only the assets of Eretz Yisrael, our true home, our spiritual <i>makkor</i>, should accompany us in the sojourn of exile. The resources and material acquired <i>chutz laAretz</i> are temporary at best and they are tainted with <i>golus</i> fever which can infect our value system at anytime.</p>
<p><i>Maasei avos siman labanim. </i>This attitude towards golus-gold is eternal. Material wealth amassed in the Diaspora is ephemeral and we must view it that way. To do otherwise places us at risk of becoming a prisoner to its lustful attraction. Real money and real value is that which we accomplish in Eretz Yisrael. Chazal are guiding us to understand that Yaakov Avinu wanted us to learn a lesson before heading down to Mitzrayim.  Golus-gold is fools gold, it may acquire things, even good things such as a burial plot in <i>mearas hamachpeila</i>, but ultimately it has no intrinsic value. We cannot take it with us nor should we. We who are so desperate for <i>geula</i> must make this attitude real. It must pulsate through all of our <i>golus</i> endeavors. Indeed, internalizing this mantra is the first ingredient in being able to proudly answer the question of <i>tzipisem</i> <i>liyishua</i> correctly.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Learn With Your Children</h2>
<p>After Yosef reveals himself to his brothers he sends them home to tell their father that he is still alive and to please come join him in Mitzrayim. The brothers hasten to their father and exclaim <i>od Yosef chai vchi hu mosheil b’chol Eretz Mitzrayim </i>- Yosef still lives and he is the ruler over all of Egypt. The Torah continues, <i>vayafag libo ki lo he&#8217;emin lahem </i>- Yakov&#8217;s heart fluttered because he did not believe them. However, when the brothers continued to tell their story, and Yakov saw the <i>agalos &#8211; </i>the wagons that Yosef sent to carry him down to Egypt the Pasuk tells us: <i>vat’chi ruach Yaakov Avihem </i>– Yaakov’s spirit was revived and invigorated. He was so much <i>b’simcha</i> that he was even ready for <i>nevuah</i>.</p>
<p>One cannot help but wonder, why didn’t Yaakov believe the <em>Shevatim</em> from the moment they reported the momentous news of Yosef’s survival? And why did the <i>agalos</i> revive Yaakov’s spirit?<span id="more-6659"></span> Lev Eliyahu explains that Yakov Avinu, upon hearing the declaration of his 11 sons – including Binyamin, had no doubt that Yosef was physically alive. What he could not believe was that <i>od Yosef </i><b><i>Chai</i></b>- that the spiritual essence of Yosef <b><i>Hatzadik</i></b> had survived after so many years away from his father and his family. Could the leader of Egypt be a frum Jew? Couldn’t be, thought Yaakov Avinu. After all, one cannot ascend to such a powerful position without a compromise of religious values and practice. Though he was happy to hear the news that Yosef was still physically alive, <i>vayafeg libo</i> Yaakov’s felt faint. He now feared not the loss of Yosef but of Yosef <i>Hatzadik!</i> His soul shuddered at the thought that his righteous son had been corrupted by the depravity of Egyptian society. The brothers tried to convince Yakov otherwise, but Yakov would not accept it. To Yakov it was impossible—until he saw the wagons that Yosef sent for him.</p>
<p>Chazal tell us that Yosef sent <i>Agalos</i> to hint to his father of the topic they had been studying 22 years earlier, the laws of <i>Egla Arufa</i>. Yosef anticipated his father&#8217;s concern and knew that if he could demonstrate to his father that he was still immersed in Torah, his father wouldn&#8217;t be disappointed, nor would he suspect that Yosef had <i>chas v’shalom</i> deviated from the Torah&#8217;s way. Indeed, as a result, <i>vat’chi ruach Yaakov Avihem</i>. Yaakov’s spirit was rejuvinated.</p>
<p>We learn from this a powerful message of how one should never underestimate nor diminish the importance of parents and children learning together. Even after twenty-two years it was the bond of Talmud Torah between father and son that gave life meaning to both Yakov and Yosef. It is a bond that lasts forever and it is never too late to start!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6643" alt="Biblical_Joseph" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Biblical_Joseph-269x300.jpg" width="269" height="300" />Parshas Miketz turns our attention to the story of Joseph&#8217;s meteoric rise to the Second in Command of Egypt. The Torah goes out of its way to tell us that Joseph and his wife had two sons before the years of famine began.</p>
<p>The Babylonian Talmud in Taanis (11a) picks up on this (Translation &#8211; Soncino). <em>&#8220;Resh Lakish said: A man may not have marital relations during years of famine, as it is said, And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The reasoning for this rule is apparently that it is wrong to add the burden of additional children at a time where resources are scarce. This is a lovely message. However Rashi in Taanis says the reason for this statement is that one should participate in the pain of the famine and since marital relations are pleasurable one should refrain from relations while others are suffering.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah quotes Tosafos in Taanis who asks how Yocheved could have been born while Jacob and his clan were moving from Israel to Egypt if it was a time of famine (assuming that she was conceived during the famine) as per the Midrash that states Yocheved was born at that time? Tosafos answer that this rule was only a stringency kept by super righteous people like Joseph.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah is not happy with this answer.<span id="more-6642"></span> First of all, Levi was Yocheved&#8217;s father. By all accounts he was a super righteous person. Moses has high praise for Levi in his blessings at the end of the Chumash. Further, the tribe of Levi did not sin at the Golden Calf because they were so super righteous!</p>
<p>Instead the Torah Temimah attempt to either interpret the words of Tosafos or offer his own answer to their question (it&#8217;s unclear to me). (I am paraphrasing the Torah Temimah here). He says that really it is permissible to engage in marital relations during a time of famine. There is no reason to add additional pain at a difficult time and relations are pleasurable. It&#8217;s not reasonable to ban pleasure when times are tough. It&#8217;s just that for someone like Joseph who was living in ivory towers in the lap of luxury it would have been inappropriate for him to engage in such pleasurable activities while his people were suffering through a famine. Joseph was joining in the pain of his people and as long as they were in famine he would not give himself the pleasure of marital relations.</p>
<p>With this explanation there is no question from Levi because Jacob and his family were certainly suffering due to the famine so they would have no such restrictions on them. This also explains the subsequent statement in the Talmud. That is: <em>Our Rabbis have taught: When Israel is in trouble and one of them separates himself from them, then the two ministering angels who accompany every man come and place their hands upon his head and say, ‘So-and-so who separated himself from the community shall not behold the consolation of the community’. </em>In other words, one who wants to associate with the suffering of the group sees the group comforted.</p>
<p>These two ideas are now related in a way that explains why they are stated back to back in the Talmud.</p>
<p>In closing the Torah Temimah has some reservations about this idea, although it fits perfectly, he says &#8220;it&#8217;s new&#8221; and it needs a lot of investigation and studying.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Shulchan Aruch (O.C 574) <i>paskens </i>that one should refrain from engaging in marital relations during a famine. So it seems that the Torah Temimah would disagree with that psak. Maybe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/furnace-fire.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6606" title="furnace-fire" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/furnace-fire-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>In Parshas Vayeshev we read the story of Tamar and Yehuda. Tamar is suspected of being harlot and following her conviction, she is sentenced to death by burning. Instead of exonerating herself by outing Yehuda, she accepts her fate and merely produces some evidence that shows Yehuda surreptitiously that he was the one who was with her.</p>
<p>The Talmud says that this teaches us that it is better to be burned alive in a fiery furnace than to embarrass one&#8217;s friend in public.</p>
<p>Tosafos ask the obvious question: If one must die in a fiery furnace rather than embarrass one&#8217;s friend, it should be included with the three cardinal sins of Judaism for which a Jew is required to give up one&#8217;s life? Those are murder, adultery, and idol worship. If embarrassing a friend must be avoided at the cost of death &#8211; it is equal to those three! Why is it omitted from the list?</p>
<p>Tosafos answer that only things that are explicit in the Torah are included in the list.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah infers that Tosafos mean that one is in fact required to give up one&#8217;s life to spare a friend embarrassment. Meaning that halachically there is no<em> </em>leeway. One must give up one&#8217;s life in order that one&#8217;s friend not be embarrassed.</p>
<p>This does not make the Torah Temimah happy.<span id="more-6604"></span> He says &#8220;if not for their words I think&#8230;&#8221; which is rabbinic code for &#8220;I very respectfully disagree&#8221;. Instead the Torah Temimah says (translation mine) that it is clear that one cannot include embarrassing a friend in the list of three cardinal sins. Rather he says that the Talmud was teaching <em>mussar</em> and good etiquette. One who does not heed the advice of the rabbis of the Talmud is not a called a <em>rasha,</em> rather he is just a person with bad character. Whereas with the three cardinal sins, the law actually requires one to martyr oneself rather than sin. One who violates one of those sins is a <em>rasha</em> and it is as if he violated the basic tenets of faith.</p>
<p>I think the significant thing here is not so much that the Torah Temimah has a different answer than Tosafos. The bomb here is that the Torah Temimah is willing to tame an extreme statement of Chazal and call it <em>mussar </em>instead of taking it literally. Tosafos did not do that. Many charedim today do not do that. But the Torah Temimah was willing to reinterpret an extreme statement of Chazal and say it was not halachic, rather it was a sermonic point that was designed to urge people to act properly without setting actual parameters of legal ramifications.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>
<p>Read the Torah Temimah here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/seferid_14052_page_349.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a></p>

<h2>Parshas Vayishlach<br />
An Important Parenting Tip From Yaakov</h2>
<p>Yaakov Avinu’s dreaded  encounter with <em>Eisav harasha</em> concludes happily with Eisav’s invitation for Yaakov to accompany him. Yaakov declines, explaining that his children are young and he is overladen with sheep and cattle. Yaakov, therefore, urges Eisav to set forth without him and proclaims “<em>va’ani esnahal l’iti liregel hamilacha asher lifanai uli’regel hayiladim </em>— I (Yaakov) will travel at my <em>own</em> pace congruent with the task at hand and the ability of the children.” <em>Chazal</em> derive many important lessons from the entire Yaakov/Eisav encounter. One particular insight is gleaned from the above response of Yaakov Avinu to his brother Eisav which provides us a critical perspective into <em>Chinuch Habanim</em>.</p>
<p>Parents have dreams for their children. Often, we set up expectations based upon our own personal goals and agendas. Sometimes, we push our youngsters hard towards these goals. Other times, we assert a <em>laissez faire</em> attitude toward their responsibilities. In general, we want them to like what we like and think how we think. We may even live vicariously through a particular child. All of the above can be a formula for disaster.</p>
<p><span id="more-6553"></span>Yaakov Avinu teaches us that in order to arrive “<em>shalem</em>”–with our family spiritually whole and intact, we must set the ambitions for <em>each</em> of our<em> kinderlach</em> “<em>l’regel hayiladim</em>” &#8211; at the pace of the children. Indeed, in setting goals for the spiritual, personal and academic growth of each child, we must consider his or her strengths, weaknesses, tendencies and character traits. One mold just won’t do it. To the contrary, we must tailor the nurturing of our children to their individual abilities and guide them toward being <em>Ovdei Hashem </em>with the G-d given talents they have been blessed with.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the<em> posuk</em> concludes with Yaakov Avinu telling Eisav that he (Yaakov) will keep pace with the children “<em>ad</em> <em>asher yavo el adoni s’eirah.</em>” Rashi notes that Yaakov Avinu never intended to journey to <em>Eisav’s</em> home, rather he was speaking of the future, the <em>yimos Hamashiach</em> of which it says, <em>v’alu moshiim b’Har Tzion lishpot es Har Eisav</em>. Clearly the unspoken message is that our ability to individualize our <em>chinuch habanim</em> is a significant, if not the requisite, force in bringing about the arrival of the ultimate redemption. An era of <em>shleimos</em> can only be delivered by our developing the <em>sheleimos</em> of each child in our care. Indeed, <em>Hashem Yisborach</em> has placed a unique<em> neshama</em> in each of us. Developing the individual potential of each child entrusted to us is our greatest responsibility and its potential affords us the greatest <em>nachas</em> of all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JudahEmblem.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6521" title="JudahEmblem" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JudahEmblem.png" alt="" width="150" height="214" /></a>In what has become a familiar refrain, the Torah Temimah in Parshas Vayetze takes the most expansive position available with regard to women prophetesses.</p>
<p>In Vayetze, Leah and Yaakov have a bunch of children who eventually become half of the tribes of Israel. In naming her fourth son, Leah decides to thank God &#8220;this time&#8221;. The commentaries wonder why Leah is thanking God &#8220;this time&#8221;. Rashi explains that she was giving thanks for taking &#8220;more than her portion&#8221;. The idea is that there were four women who were the mothers of the tribes to be and there were to be 12 tribes. If each mother got her equal share they would each bear three sons. Leah was now on her fourth so she realized she was getting &#8220;more than she thought she was getting&#8221;. For this she thanked God.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah tells us that Rashi is quoting a Midrash Raba and that Leah knew this information because she saw it with <em>ruach hakodesh. </em>He then quotes a Maharsha that says that this cannot be a prophecy because Leah is not included in the list of twelve prophetesses in the first chapter of (Babylonian Talmud) Megillah 14A. Rather she made this proclamation with no intent and God placed it in her lips to speak of the future. The Torah Temimah remarks that this is very hard pill to swallow.<span id="more-6520"></span></p>
<p>So instead, the Torah Temimah says, and there is no need to quote him here so I will paraphrase, that all the matriarchs were prophetesses. He uses a Midrash Socher Tov to support this assertion as that Midrash makes a drasha to make the same point. He goes on to say that there are competing opinions among the rabbinic commentators and there are sources on each side of the debate. Therefore, one cannot ask from one source to the other.</p>
<p>Nothing too groundbreaking here, but the overall point is that once again the Torah Temimah is trying his best to include women as potential prophetesses. And for that we thank him.</p>
<p>Also, I think it is clear from the Maharsha and the Torah Temimah that <em>ruach hakodesh </em>would be considered prophecy. I am pretty sure this is the opinion of Maimonides. What&#8217;s interesting, is that it seems that one cannot posses <em>ruach hakodesh </em> unless one is a candidate for prophecy. Are there any opinions who claim authentic prophecy is possible today? Can we authoritatively rule out<em> ruach hakodesh</em> as well? At least according to this Maharsha? I think so.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayetze<br />
The Ropes That Pull Us Together</h2>
<p>As we begin to see the emergence of Yaakov Avinu as the father of the <em>shivtei ka </em>we cannot help but notice the many nuanced messages and symbolism the Torah shares with us. One such <em>yesod</em> is found in the encounter of Yitzchok Avinu at the famous well outside of Charan.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that Yaakov Avinu arrived at Charan after his harrowing journey in flight from his brother. As he arrived he finds himself at the <em>be’er basadeh</em>. There the famous tale of his encounter with Rochel Imeinu is recorded. Chazal wonder what is to be learned from the fact that it is a <em>be’er basadeh</em>, a well in the field, which defines Yaakov Avinu’s arrival into <em>golus</em>.</p>
<p>Midrashim are filled with symbolic messages explaining the representations of this <em>be’er</em>, the <em>edrei tzon</em> and the large stone which sealed and provided access to the water source of the community. The Malbim provides us a most meaningful <em>mehalach </em>so relevant to us today.<span id="more-6505"></span></p>
<p>In his approach the Malbim explains that the<em> be’er </em>represents the <em>mekor mayim chayim</em>. It reflects the<em> hashpaas</em> Hashem, His goodness and bountiful blessings that give us the proverbial hug from the Borei Olam. In a word, the Be’er represents the Shechina and how it fills our lives with all of His blessings. The symbolism is powerful.</p>
<p>The Malbim points out that as Yaakov was now in <em>golus</em> the Shechina came with him, indeed the <em>be’er</em> was <em>basadeh</em>, in the field outside of Eretz Yisrael. However, when Klal Yisrael is living in their homeland with the close access to the Shechina the Bais Hamikdash provides we will find the <em>be’er bisoch ha’er</em>, in the very heart of the city. Nevertheless, while residing in <em>golus </em>it is our vital task to bring that <em>be’er</em> and the spiritual nourishment it represents from the <em>sadeh</em> into our home.</p>
<p>Just how does one bring the sanctity and warmth of the <em>be’er</em> into their home? The Malbim again draws on the words of Chazal and teaches that Reb Yehoshua taught his students that the way to harness the power of the <em>be’er</em> and pull it from the <em>sadeh</em> into the city is by fashioning <em>chavalim min hasubim</em> and through that be <em>machzeer Shechinaso leTziyon</em>. Strands braided from the leftover and unwanted fibers can be spun and twisted into powerful ropes, attached to the well and used to <em>shlep</em> it into the heart of the city. The ropes the Malbim describes represent the spinning and twisting together of Klal Yisrael from many fragments (even discarded ones) into one cord of strength as Yidden from all walks of life come together to accomplish the seemingly impossible.</p>
<p>The message is clear. If we want to bring the Shechina into our city, our community and our home we need strong ropes of <em>achdus</em> to pull together and bring the <em>be’er </em>closer and provide us the spiritual refreshment the <em>hashpaas haShechina </em>bestows. Only through <em>achdus</em> can we truly fare well.</p>
<p>This is no small feat.</p>
<p>Too often we stand apart rather then building on what we have in common. However, we must find a way to wrap ourselves around our common heartfelt <em>emuna</em> and the inner goodness of each Jew to braid a cord of unity and strength with which to connect to the Shechina and bring it home. This, Chazal teach us, is the formula for extricating ourselves from the morass of <em>golus</em>. It is not enough to seek spirituality. We must pull it inward. We cannot do it ourselves &#8211; we need every fiber of Jewry to pull together as one strong cord of strength. By doing so we can hope to fill our lives with His love and bring the <em>be’er </em>into our homes and thereby bring our homes to the ultimate <em>mikor</em> of <em>kedusha</em> in Yerushalayim Ir Hakodesh<br />
<em>bimheira biyameinu</em>.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Toldos<br />
The Man Makes the Clothes</h2>
<p>As Yaakov Avinu dons the <em>bigdei chamudos </em>of Eisav Harasha the impersonation of his brother is complete. He places goat skins on his neck and hands and enters the chamber of Yitzchok Avinu with the delicacies prepared by his mother. Something else accompanies him, too. As Yitzchok verifies Yaakov’s identity, he tenders a fatherly kiss, and notices a fragrant aroma streaming forth from Yaakov’s wardrobe and gives him a bracha. As he does so, Yitzchok exclaims; <em>“re’eh reiach b’nee kreiach hasadeh asher beracho Hashem</em>.” Chazal explain this to mean that the aroma of Gan Eden emanated from the very clothing Yaakov put on to visit his father.</p>
<p>One cannot help but wonder, why now? What was so unusual?  After all, the <em>bigdei chamudos </em>that Yaakov was wearing were the very same special clothes that Eisav himself wore when he went to serve his father. Didn’t the aroma of Gan Eden accompany them when Eisav wore them, too? Apparently not. Indeed, it is the man that makes the clothes and not vice versa.<span id="more-6477"></span></p>
<p>Chazal teach that Eisav’s <em>bigdei chamudos </em>was really the special cloak that Eisav took from Nimrod. This garment has a long history. It was the same outfit that Hashem Yisborach <em>kivayachol </em>fashioned for Adam and Chava, the k<em>osnos ohr</em>, He used to clothe them after He evicted them from Gan Eden. But if these clothes were given to Adam and Chava after their being thrown out of Gan Eden how do they carry its aroma?</p>
<p>The answer is found in our understanding of that first cloak. Though the posuk spells the word ohr with the letter ayin, meaning leather, the Midrash says, that in the Torah of  Rabbi Meir, the word ohr was written with an alef, meaning light. How are we to understand this Chazal?</p>
<p>Life in Gan Eden before the sin of Adam and Chava was supernatural. Wheat stalks grew from kernels into the finest cakes, right out of the ground! There was no need to further refine its nature. Its spiritual potential and physical essence were the perfect harmonious blend that Hashem Yisborach intended. All that changed after the <em>cheit</em> of Adam Harishon. No longer would the world produce a naturally finished product. Though man could no longer enjoy the instant Kedusha which surrounded him in Gan Eden, all was not lost. Hashem still gave us the opportunity of sanctifying this world. But now we would have to do it on our own. Hashem in his infinite kindness enabled us to recreate the essential Gan Eden experience. With hard work we are able to spiritualize the world gifted to us. We can imbue all we touch with ruchniyus. We can transform the <em>olam hagashmi,</em> symbolized by leather, (<em>ohr</em> with an <em>ayin</em>) into light &#8211; a spiritual luminescence – the <em>ohr</em> with an alef! In so doing we recreate the essence of Gan Eden in our lives today. This is the message of Rabbi Meir.</p>
<p>Indeed, this essence of Gan Eden was mastered by Yaakov Avinu, the <em>ish tam yosheiv ohalim</em>. He with his <em>middah</em> of <em>emes</em> was able to impart all the qualities of His <em>ruchniyus </em>and transform whatever <em>gashmiyus </em>came his way into a <em>cheftza shel kedusha</em>, mastering and harnessing its total spiritual potential. This is the <em>koach</em> that enables Yaakov to produce the 12 <em>shevatim</em>. Approaching Yitzchok Avinu with the <em>mitzvah</em> maximized to its fullest potential, the aroma of Gan Eden was now with him as well. No wonder that Eisav Harasha could never produce that fragrant scent while he wore those clothes. Only a Yaakov Avinu could bring out their <em>kedusha</em> to the fullest. We, his children have that same potential. We can bring the essence of Eden to the world each day. It is our ultimate <em>tachlis</em> and makes Hashem so very proud of all that we, His children, can achieve.</p>
