				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6936" alt="baby" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby-300x294.png" width="300" height="294" />The beginning of Parshas Tazria instructs the Jewish people on commandments that relate to matters of childbirth. One law sates that a woman who gives birth is ritually impure for seven days if she bears a son and fourteen days if she bears a daughter.</p>
<p>The Torah does not tell us why there is a difference between the days of ritual impurity for a son and a daughter. Naturally, this led our great rabbis to speculate and provide their own insights into these laws. Inevitably these commentaries will reflect the social and scientific norms of their milieu.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to track the development of these ideas.</p>
<p>Two general categories of interpretations are given to explain the discrepancy between the days of impurity for a son and a daughter. One category goes the social route and the other goes the medical route.<span id="more-6935"></span></p>
<p>The social route generally considers sons to be a great blessing and daughters to be a bit of a curse. Rabbi Josh Waxman has a great example of one medieval commentator who takes this tack (see: <a href="http://parsha.blogspot.com/2013/04/guys-rule-in-tazria.html">Guys rule in Tazria</a>). One can see hints of this sort of thinking in the Talmud as well. Boys earned money for the family while girls were a financial strain on the ancient family. Thus, it follows that there would be a longer period of ritual impurity for a daughter because it was less joyous. I&#8217;m not sure how this actually works logically, but you do see this line of thinking.</p>
<p>The medical route considers the birth of a son to be easier or to expel less blood or that girls are born &#8220;cooler&#8221; so the mother needs longer to heal because coolness causes illness or that boys are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 40 days and girls are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 80 days. These are ideas found in the Rishonim to explain the double waiting time for a daughter.</p>
<p>None of these reasons would satisfy the modern reader of the Chumash. No matter how &#8220;frum&#8221; one may be, these explanations don&#8217;t work anymore. Either because girls no longer cost more than boys, or because daughters are not considered a curse. Further, we know that the medicine found in these interpretations is incorrect as well.</p>
<p>Artscroll, which is by and large very traditionalist in their interpretations, shies away from these ancient commentaries as well. They are almost forced to pluck a beautiful idea from a very unlikely source to give some sort of explanation here. Artscroll quotes R&#8217; Dovid Tzvi Hoffman (late 19th century) who says that really the appropriate amount of days would be fourteen days. But since we want the mother of the child to attend the Bris Milah the Torah subtracts some time from the ritual impurity and knocks it down to seven days so that she will be able to participate in her son&#8217;s entering of the covenant.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Hoffman&#8217;s answer is lovely. But it is not found in earlier commentaries. The reason for that is because up until recently, the other interpretations were plausible. Once those interpretations became anachronistic, another interpretation was needed. R&#8217; Hoffman provides one such interpretation. Artscroll is written for 21st century Jews. They wisely choose the newer, more modern interpretation for their publication.</p>
<p>The beginning of the parsha also features some ancient science on conception. The verse says that a &#8220;woman who seeds a seed a births a son.&#8221; The implication is that the son is born because because the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221;. The Talmud explains that when the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a son. When the man &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a daughter. Ramban explains that the woman&#8217;s blood meets the man&#8217;s semen and they are the two ingredients that form the child. Whichever is &#8220;first&#8221; determines the gender. With this (wrong) medical explanation, the verse makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Ramban also brings the Greek version of conception which is different and has nothing to do with who is first. So he then explains how the verse is rendered if one holds like the Greeks! Ramban says that the word simply means seed in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>What are we to make of all this?</p>
<p>First of all, we see several examples of interpretations from ancient times that no longer work today. We are forced to abandon these commentaries and seek out newer commentaries. More importantly, it means that the ancient commentaries were based on conventional wisdom of their times. They did the best they could with what they had available to them. But their commentaries were not infallible. Particularly in areas of matters that are flux we cannot avoid the conclusion that they made mistakes and that their science or social conventions were not Divine.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think we see that even Ramban himself wasn&#8217;t so sure that Chazal were right about conception. He quotes the Greeks and gives a less elegant interpretation of the verse to reconcile their view. What does this mean? It means that when science buttresses up against the words of a verse, we are forced to reconcile the verse using creative interpretations. That must be allowed. After all the Ramban did just that. Today we are faced with similar challenges. Sometimes the old, simpler interpretations no longer work. What would Ramban do? He would reinterpret. But who among us has the shoulders of Ramban? Anyone? No one?</p>
<p>It is possible that the next Ramban is in our midst today. But with our somewhat stifling manner of Chumash study which hardly allows for innovation and reinterpretation, how will our Ramban ever show himself? Or perhaps she is a she? Who knows? One thing is clear, we don&#8217;t learn or teach Chumash the same way our ancestors learned Chumash. Instead we teach ChumashÂ <em>the way our ancestors taught it.</em> I think we can do better.</p>
