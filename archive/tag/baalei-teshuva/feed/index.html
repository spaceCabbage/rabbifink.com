				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a great article in the NY Times last week about nostalgia. I believe that nostalgia is a very important element of the religious experience. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/03/21/the-magical-secret-of-the-seder/">The Magical Secret of the Seder</a>)</p>
<p>I had no idea that until recently nostalgia was considered a mental disorder. Apparently, it was thought to be akin to depression. But people who were nostalgic were not sad and so research commenced to determine the proper classification and function of nostalgia.</p>
<p>It turns out that nostalgia is actually pretty useful. Studies have shown that nostalgia can make people feel happier, can physically warm the body, can give people hope, and overall improve one&#8217;s life. This all serves very important evolutionary purposes. Modernly, it helps with relationships in general and in particular with marriage. Good memories make for good relationships.<span id="more-7393"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7394" alt="V7K1cJRPaafgLZP" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/V7K1cJRPaafgLZP-600x450.jpg" /></p>
<p>Looking at nostalgia through the lens of the religious person, nostalgia becomes even more useful. If our religion gives us good memories and makes us feel good when we are young it is going to be important to us to relive those memories year to year and life event to life event. Even more importantly, it motivates us to give our children similar experiences. We want our children to look fondly upon their youth and we want religion to be front and center in their positive memories.</p>
<p>I think we should cultivate good memories. We should create our own nostalgia. We should actively mine those memories for good feelings towards people, family, spouses, and of course religion. Jewish holidays are perfect for this kind of work but really it should be a full time effort.</p>
<p>All this leads me to two issues that are plaguing the orthodox Jewish community right now.</p>
<p>Victims of sex abuse invoke many coping mechanisms to deal with the betrayal and violence of the crimes perpetrated against them. Obviously, if the abuser is an authority or religious figure, the victim&#8217;s associations with religion become supremely negative. There is little religious nostalgia for victims. Even worse, is when the coping mechanism involves repressing memories of one&#8217;s childhood. Some victims cannot even remember their childhood. Clearly, these victims have no nostalgia towards their religion. They may stay in the fold for other reasons, but an important part of their religious experience is left with a gaping hole instead of positive memories. Aside from robbing children of their innocence and inflicting untold pain of their victims, predators paint over their victim&#8217;s childhood memories with a very big, very dark brush. This has many negative consequences, including religious consequences.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have witnessed there is a recent spate of <i>baalei teshuva </i>returning to their prior lives and leaving orthodox Judaism. This group also lacks the nostalgia of an orthodox Jewish upbringing. This is not a defect. It can be a difference that does not make a distinction. But for some people, it can be hard to stay in the orthodox Jewish community and for some of those people nostalgia is a decent motivating factor. Unfortunately, those who choose to become orthodox later in life lack this secret weapon. Sometimes that can make all the difference in the world between staying or leaving.</p>
<p>The article in the NY Times corroborates what I think is a very underappreciated part of being an orthodox Jew. Nostalgia. Those who are missing it, whether because of despicable violence or courage to choose orthodox Judaism are often missing this non-essential ingredient. But we all have the power to give it to our children and I contend that it&#8217;s a very worthwhile endeavor.</p>
