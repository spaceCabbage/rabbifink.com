I spoke about the fatal flaw that doomed the Hasmonean dynasty. I think the approach is novel. I have never seen or heard anything that provides this particular perspective and I hope you find the idea I propose thought provoking.

Agree or disagree, I always enjoy hearing your thoughts.

It was a great party, stay tuned for photos in a later post.

<p>There are a few seminal events that are rare, exhilarating and emotional in the life of a Rabbi. One of those events is the dedication of a new Torah scroll. And yesterday I was fortunate to be a part of a wonderful Torah Dedication ceremony and celebration.</p>
<p><strong>Randy</strong> and <strong>Deeana Frankel</strong> are celebrating the Bnei Mitzvah of their son <strong>Zev</strong> and their daughter <strong>Ariella</strong>. They chose to commemorate this milestone by restoring a Torah scroll rescued from the Holocaust. During a small, intimate ceremony, that Torah scroll has been placed in the Ark at the Shul on the Beach and we could not be more proud.</p>
<p>The ceremony was the typical Torah dedication with one small exception. The standard procession took place on the Venice Boardwalk.<span id="more-3467"></span> Hundreds of people stopped to watch, photograph, record video and enjoy the celebration. It was clearly inspirational for many of the observers to see such excitement and honor given to the Torah. It was a real kiddush Hashem.</p>
<p>We danced on the boardwalk with the Torah for a little while then proceeded into the Shul where we placed the Torah in its new home in the Ark. Following the ceremony we enjoyed a lovely catered lunch. During the lunch Randy spoke for a few minutes. I also addressed the guests for a few minutes and you can hear both speeches by clicking the play button below.</p>
<p>This morning, we used the Torah for the first time as we read from the Torah as part of morning services. It was very powerful to call Randy to the Torah to make the blessing on the Torah using his very own Torah.</p>
<p>The event was very inspirational for me and something I will never forget. Not all rabbis are lucky enough to participate in a Torah dedication ceremony and I thank the Frankels for making me a lucky rabbi!</p>
<p>I had a few photos taken of the procession. The Frankels had a professional photographer who can certainly put these photos to shame but the celebration was so special and so unique that I wanted to share these photos with everyone.</p>
