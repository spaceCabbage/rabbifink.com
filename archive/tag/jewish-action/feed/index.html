				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Jewish Action published a <a href="http://www.ou.org/jewish_action/12/2014/rekindling-flame-neo-chassidus-brings-inner-light-torah-modern-orthodoxy/" target="_blank">nice report on a phenomenon</a> that is gaining steam in the Modern Orthodox world. The article identifies the movement as Neo-Chassidus and describes it as a path toward connection with God. It stands in contradistinction to other strains of Judaism that are described as dry, cold, and lacking in the deeper joy that Chasiddus has to offer.</p>
<p>To be clear, the Neo-Chassids are embracing the 18th and 19th century versions of Chasidic philosophy and a smidge of practice. They are not converting to contemporary Chassidic sects like Ger, Satmar, Bobov, and Vizhnitz.</p>
<p>This is a great development. Typical Orthodox Judaism artificially constrains people to the customs and philosophy of the sect to which they are born.<span id="more-9030"></span> If you are born a Yekke, you will be a Yekke. If you are born a Hasid, you will be a Hasid.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/12/10/will-the-real-neo-chassids-please-stand-up/v12p066a01/" rel="attachment wp-att-9033"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9033" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/V12p066a01.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="V12p066a01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> If you are born a Litvak, you will be a Litvak. But some people who are born Yekkes would thrive as a Hasid but fail as a Yekke. Some people who are born Litvaks would thrive in a Sephardic environment. It&#8217;s prudent to allow cross-pollination between different versions of Orthodox Judaism. It gives more people a chance to succeed and feel connected to their Judaism. We should definitely encourage people to explore more versions of Orthodox Judaism and allow people the space the find their place along the spectrum of Orthodox Judaism. We should invite people to find the Judaism that speaks most directly to them and allow people to mix and match their Judaism so they can craft a personal experience that feels good and serves their religious needs.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s super awesome that Modern Orthodox kids who are seeking a more spiritual version of Judaism turn to Neo-Chassidus. If that works for them, great. It would be foolish to impose Neo-Chassidus on everyone, but for those who seek it out and find it to be rewarding, the option should be on the table.</p>
<p>While I support the Neo-Chasids, the whole process seems a bit off to me. Chassidus was started as a response to significant social issues within Orthodox Judaism. There was a spiritual malaise across the land. Our laws and rituals had become institutionalized to the point that they had lost their spirit and soul. Judaism became inaccessible to the average person. Something needed to bring passion and purpose to Judaism for everyone. Chassidus answered the call. It spawned enormous contributions to Orthodox Judaism, Torah, and philosophy. These interpretations and innovations addressed the needs of Jews living in Eastern Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries. Unfortunately, at some point, these Chasidic expressions of Jewish ecstasy and exultation also became institutionalized. Ironically, organized Chassidic sects are now very similar to the things they were invented to address.</p>
<p>The point is that Chassidus is an answer to a question that was relevant more than a couple hundred years ago. It is not a new answer to new questions and challenges. Some people are inspired by the ideas Chassidus teaches and that&#8217;s perfectly fine. But it seems like a roundabout way of addressing the modern challenges of the Neo-Chassids. Why answer a 2014 question with a 1714 answer? The first Chassids were not satisfied to answer 1714 questions with 1414 answers. That&#8217;s why they created 1714 Chassidus!</p>
<p>So my suggestion is to be more like those first Chassids and less like the 2014 Chassids. Real Neo-Chassidus, in my opinion, is not pantomiming contemporary Chassidus. To me, real Neo-Chassidus proudly adopts a methodology that gifted us with an avant-garde solution to a real problem in 1714. The methodology is the thing we need, not the solutions we crafted using that methodology a few centuries ago.</p>
<p>First, we must identify the issues that challenge 2014 Orthodox Judaism. We have been doing that here and on Facebook while others do the same in a variety of other forums and formats. Then we collaboratively create Jewish experiences that address those challenges. It&#8217;s possible that the answers we come up with will direct us towards institutionalized Chassidus or, perhaps more likely, a deinstitutionalized contemporary Chassidus. But it&#8217;s very possible that our 2014 answers will look and feel and taste different than 1714 answers. Our new answers will look more modern and feel more cosmopolitan and taste more fresh.</p>
<p>Rabbi Norman Lamm writes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592643094/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592643094&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkId=VRUREVO4SYNITLTK">Torah Umadda</a> that Modern Orthodox Judaism in America is actually a form of Neo-Chassidus. Using the same methodologies that triggered Chassidus, Modern Orthodoxy was crafted to address the challenges of mid-20th century Judaism. I think he&#8217;s right. I also think it&#8217;s time to do it again and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>In light of all this, I propose that the Neo-Chassidus featured in the Jewish Action should be called Retro-Chassidus or Hipster Chassidus. Neo-Chassidus should live up to its name and actually be &#8220;neo.&#8221; Those who are adopting teachings and practices of the 2014 Chassids are not Neo-Chassids. They are Retro or Hipster-Chassids. The group of people who use the methodologies of the first Chassids are the Neo-Chassids. We should be those people. We should engage in this process. We should be the Neo-Chassids. Only then can we be confident that we are properly addressing the needs of the modern American Jew. Only then can we imagine that we might find what the Judaism that we seek. Right now, nothing is more important.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last summer, The Jewish Action featured a panel of experts answering the &#8220;tough questions.&#8221; One of the panelists was the great Rabbi Lawrence (Leib) Kelemen of Neve and Mussar Vaad fame. The question he was asked was: &#8220;Why are so many kids off the Derech?&#8221; (That&#8217;s their term. I don&#8217;t use it.)</p>
<p>Rabbi Kelemen starts off great. He says that kids don&#8217;t leave Orthodox Judaism because of a cell phone or the Internet or even because they never experience the beauty of Shabbos. He even says that secular courses at college are not the problem.<span id="more-7890"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10142436.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7891" alt="10142436" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10142436.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Then he cites the research of the two foremost Orthodox therapists who deal with these issues in a paper published 15 years ago:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;First, there are child risk factors, such as attention deficit disorder (ADD), hyperactivity, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), learning disabilities, poor academic abilities, poor social skills and depression. Second, there are environmental risk factors, which include major medical or economic crises, corrupt rabbis and teachers, sexual abuse, physical abuse, lack of recognition of individual strengths and Internet abuse. Third, there are family risk factors, which include hypercritical or angry home environments, parents with poor parenting skills and lack of shalom bayis.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>But Rabbi Kelemen says that the only real cause in this list compiled by professionals in the field, is the home. Forget the first two reasons mentioned in the paper. Basically, the real problem is bad parenting. He calls it parental selfishness.</p>
<p>He then discusses some other very important points and critiques of frum culture including: The emotional cost of being a frum Jew, teaching Mitzvos without appreciation for Mitzvos, the Shidduch system meat market, and overall misplaced values. These are all excellent points.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I didn&#8217;t love how Rabbi Kelemen latched on to one particular reason for kids leaving Orthodox Judaism and in essence blaming the parents, it was a pretty decent article. Made some good points, fell a little flat in others.</p>
<p>Apparently, not everyone saw it this way. It seems an avalanche of letters arrived in The Jewish Action mailboxes criticizing Rabbi Kelemen&#8217;s take on the issue. They sensed that Rabbi Kelemen was being too hard on parents of children who had left Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Rabbi Kelemen responds in the current Winter 2013 issue of The Jewish Action. He basically doubles down on his theory, and not only that, he expresses regret that he left wiggle room for anyone to think that the parents did not cause the child to leave Orthodox Judaism. In fairness, a letter from a third professional (this is in addition to the two cited in the 2013 article) lends some support to his theory that the parents are to blame, but the context of the letter was to answer a specific question, not to address the general issue.</p>
<p>He also cites R&#8217; Chaim Kanievsky who says that if the parents fought in the home then the children cannot be blamed for rebelling. This too, does not address the issue head on, it simply exculpates children from difficult homes from Heavenly Justice. Finally, he quotes R&#8217; Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg who said that almost every child who is struggling with their religion is seeking attention they could not get at home from their bad parents.</p>
<p>This response disturbs me.</p>
<p>First of all, I respect R&#8217; Chaim Kanievsky, but I don&#8217;t think he is in a position to offer specific advice on this specific issue. I could be wrong, but I do not think that he has experience with formerly Orthodox Jews in any meaningful sense. I simply have never heard of him being involved with these kids. Other Gedolim have such experience. I don&#8217;t believe R&#8217; Chaim is one of them. So while his thoughts are interesting and worth hearing, I don&#8217;t see how his oblique statement should be taken more seriously than experts in the field. The same goes for R&#8217; Scheinberg.</p>
<p>Second of all, I don&#8217;t like the assumption that there is a common or specific reason that people leave Orthodox Judaism which implies that without some sort of trauma or disability they would not leave. People leave for tons of reasons. And many people leave for intellectual or social reasons despite charmed childhoods. It&#8217;s arrogant to think we can turn every born Orthodox Jew into an adult Orthodox Jew. It just doesn&#8217;t work for some people. We have to acknowledge that possibility in any discussion of the topic.</p>
<p>Third of all, because there are completely healthy people who leave Orthodox Judaism, it&#8217;s obvious that not all of them are scarred by bad parenting. Most children of bad parents actually don&#8217;t leave Orthodox Judaism. Conversely, we all know excellent parents who have children who left Orthodox Judaism. The blame game here is silly and tired.</p>
<p>I remember when the Jewish Observer article on this phenomenon was released in the 90&#8217;s. The parents blamed the schools, the schools blamed the parents, the professionals blamed mental health issues, and the teens didn&#8217;t blame anything. I heard from rabbis who attended the Nefesh conferences in those days that the sessions were basically arguing over who was to blame.</p>
<p>Has it never occurred to people that not everyone is going to be frum? Has it ever occurred to people that some people just don&#8217;t get anything from Orthodox Judaism. Yesterday, I wrote about an heir to a Chasidic dynasty that did not feel comfortable in his religious environment. If not for an external factor, he may have left Orthodox Judaism too. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/26/book-review-untold-tales-of-the-hasidim/">Book Review | Untold Tales of the Hasidim</a>). The author of that book <a href="http://unpious.com/2012/05/interview-with-professor-david-assaf/" target="_blank">said in an interview</a> that he was raised Orthodox, but just never felt or believed in God so he stopped practicing. It&#8217;s not always something other than that! I recently talked with a young man who left Orthodox Judaism about his journey. I asked him when he felt like he was no longer Orthodox. He told me that he never actually felt Orthodox. Throughout his years of school he kind of just breezed right through it and knew in his head that when high school yeshiva was over, he was going to leave. No trauma, no mental illness, no story. Just left. He&#8217;s not the only one.</p>
<p>When the question of &#8220;Why are so many kids off the Derech?&#8221; is asked, the only proper response in my opinion, is to say that each kid has their own reason and each kid has their own story and each kid has their own choice to stay or to go.</p>
<p>People would like to identify trends so that fewer born Orthodox Jews leave. If the reasons for their flight are understood, the thinking is that the community can reform its behavior and as a result more people will stay Orthodox. Unfortunately, this is a game of whack-a-mole. There are too many reasons and too many factors to effectively keep everyone in the fold.</p>
<p>However, there is something that can be universally implemented. Many teens or young adults experiment with a life outside the confines of Orthodox Judaism. Some people call these kids &#8220;at-risk&#8221;. How we treat these kids is very likely to impact their loyalties as they grow older. If we marginalize them, infantilize them, insult them, hurt them, hate them, or judge them we are likely sealing their fate. So while I don&#8217;t think we can possibly control all the factors that might push someone to leave Orthodox Judaism, we can adjust our attitude toward people who are on the margins. They must be made to feel comfortable, loved, accepted, important, smart, and capable of contributing positively to the community. That is something we can control and it is something that should be done regardless of whether it will keep more people Orthodox. But I have a feeling it would help the numbers too.</p>
<p>Finally, I do think there is a bit of a silver lining here. If frum people really think that mental illness, and learning disabilities, or even ADD is a huge factor in kids leaving Orthodox Judaism and that a peaceful home is of utmost importance to keeping kids frum and that we should instill positive Judaism in our education system in order that more people appreciate the beauty of Orthodox Judaism so they will want to stay Orthodox, go for it! I think it&#8217;s a bit disappointing that we would only seem to address these issues as a way to prevent people from leaving Orthodox Judaism, but if that&#8217;s what gets people exciting about solving these problems, I am all for it. I would prefer if these challenges were addressed simply because they are important issues on their own, but sometimes people need superficial motivation to do the right thing. At the very least we can justify putting more resources into solving these very real problems for the sake of all the people who are affecting by them, not just the kids who are at risk of leaving Orthodox Judaism.</p>

Communication via Facebook and other sites is completely normal in 2012. People share their lives and their ideas on these sites and there are plenty of potential benefits as well as potential problems.</p>
<p>Adults are responsible for themselves and whatever trouble they may find for themselves is their problem. That&#8217;s what being a grown-up is all about.</p>
<p>Children are a different story. Parents are responsible to their children to protect them from harm and to prepare them for life. Any challenge that presents itself to children should be successfully navigated with the assistance, or guidance, or upon the teaching of adults.<span id="more-6195"></span></p>
<p>So when it comes to social media and children, the parents are placed in their familiar role as parents. Responsible parents don&#8217;t let their children drive cars before they have their license. They don&#8217;t allow them to choose to watch whatever television programs or movies they think they want. Good parents would not drop their child off at an amusement park and tell them that they are on their own. Similarly, responsible parents would not allow their children carte blanche use of the computer and the Internet. The Jewish Action talked with a broad spectrum of educators and asked them their opinion on children and social media.</p>
<p>I endorse the idea of having this conversation. Children need direction and when parents do not have their own experience to draw upon, the idea of parenting on the fly can be very imposing and potentially disastrous. Today&#8217;s parents are raising children in a world that is very different than the world in which they were raised. The appropriate thing to do is to prepare ourselves as parent to meet the challenges of raising children in the digital age. Social media is a particularly thorny issue as it is ever evolving. Creating relationships online is dangerous stuff and unless it is monitored and managed properly it can become a serious problem. The Jewish Action is doing a great service by starting the conversation. Even if some of the responses are not that great, the conversation is taking place.</p>
<p>The various responses are not necessarily answering the exact same questions and so the answers don&#8217;t really overlap even if sometimes it is clear that they are not in agreement with each other. Some answers are substantive, some are not. I will leave it to you to read the various responses and make your own judgments.</p>
<p>We need to have this conversation in our schools, communities, and families. Invariably, the more reasonable approaches will mirror the approach that each group takes to other mediums. Hopefully we can use the Internet for good and our children will use it for good as well. Clearly, the opportunity that the Internet presents is great. With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>In my (insignificant) opinion, preteens have no business being on social networks. Teens who are in schools that frown upon Internet use should not be on the Internet either. If they are on the Internet they should certainly not be on social networks. In more permissive environments, parents should treat the computer with rules akin to Yichud. Teens do not need smartphones. If they have them, they should not have unfiltered Internet access. Only in groups where everyone is on a social network should the idea even be considered. If parents allow their children on social networks they need to share the password and only parents should approve &#8220;friends&#8221;. Those are my thoughts.</p>
<p>One nugget worth sharing is this paraphrase that allegedly comes from R&#8217; Matisyahu Solomon by way of Rabbi Mordechai Yaffe. In his words: <em>&#8220;I would like to point out that I personally heard the venerated Lakewood Mashgiach Rabbi Matisyahu Salomon say that the Internet is not the enemy—the yetzer hara is.&#8221; </em>This it the first I have heard of this sentiment from R&#8217; Matisyahu. It is certainly a positive development.</p>
<p>I suggest reading the full article in the Jewish Action.</p>
