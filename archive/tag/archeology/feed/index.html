				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Shema_Yisrael.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6497" title="Shema_Yisrael" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Shema_Yisrael-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>A little background: Someone I know, and respect, was watching a documentary online about something Jewish history related. One of the people interviewed in the documentary was Professor Lawrence Schiffman. Some time later, this fellow mentioned something about &#8220;the conservative rabbi in the documentary&#8221;. I did not understand who he was talking about. Eventually we figured out that he was talking about Prof. Schiffman. Incredulous, I told this person that Prof. Schiffman is a very orthodox Jew and certainly not a conservative rabbi!</p>
<p>But I think I can understand why a run of the mill orthodox Jew would consider Prof. Schiffman conservative. It is on display in his recent, <a href="http://lawrenceschiffman.com/the-lord-is-one-reflections-on-the-history-of-judaism-in-light-of-the-shema-text-from-halbturn-austria/" target="_blank">magnificent blog post about an 1800 year old Golden Shema plate from Austria</a>. The article is really incredible in its scope and implication and I highly recommend reading it for several reasons.</p>
<p>The point I wish to focus our attention is the overall theme that Judaism has evolved, but not just from the time of the Mishna to now, it evolved from the time of entering the Land of Israel with Joshua to the time of the Mishna. Primarily, Prof. Schiffman suggests that monotheism in Judaism changed from a fuzzy version of One God with multiple Deity like figures to a more modern version of Monotheism where there is One God and no other power.</p>
<p>Things like magical spells are permissible using this original form of fuzzy monotheism, if done in the right way. Once the rabbis of the mishna modernized and canonized monotheism in a more rigid manner, &#8220;white&#8221; magic would be prohibited.<span id="more-6496"></span></p>
<p>To me, this also explains how in the origins of Christianity a Trinity was not so completely at odds with Judaism. There was an ancient Jewish tradition of fuzzy monotheism to draw from. The immediate reaction was to counter with rigid monotheism and then later on, the Mystics, according to Chacham Faur, reinvigorated some of the fuzzy monotheistic flavor back into Judaism.</p>
<p>But the overarching theme here is that things do change and Judaism does respond to social, political, and religious conditions. Whether is a conscious move or a subconcsious drift, Judaism is not a monolith and it never really has been.</p>
<p>As Prof. Schiffman concludes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This is Judaism as a historical phenomenon in ancient times.  To deny this diversity and to use the term “Judaisms” is also to deny its continuity and commonality and, hence, to deny its essence.  To deny its variegation is to turn it into a cult, in the modern sense of the term. To deny its often fuzzy boundaries is to deny its identity.</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But to state this today is to contradict the contemporary orthodox Jewish narrative. Saying these things implies something other than orthodox Judaism. It can lead an objective, honest, 2012 orthodox Jew to think that this is objectionable and only that for some reason only makes sense in the paradigm of conservative Judaism. That is a shame. Let us hope that we can broaden the spectrum just enough to be more honest about the evolution of Judaism. Let us try to ensure that there is a place, if not a primary one, for acknowledging Judaism&#8217;s capacity to change and at the same time be inclusive of many different shapes and forms even within orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/synagogue-zodiacs-02-260x284.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6184" title="synagogue-zodiacs-02-260x284" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/synagogue-zodiacs-02-260x284.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="284" /></a>I read a fascinating article on BibArch over the weekend. The article stands on its own merit, but it has some secondary relevance that I think is worth noting.</p>
<p>There are a number of ancient Jewish synagogues that have been excavated in the Land of Israel that date back to the sixth century. That means that these synagogues were extant around the closing of the Babylonian Talmud. Today, we are very familiar with the kind of Rabbinic Judaism that was practiced by the rabbis of the Talmud and to a large extent, orthodox Judaism is a logical extension of that form of Jewish practice.</p>
<p>However, these synagogues had mosaics and the mosaics tell a story that is different than the Judaism practiced and preached in the Talmud.</p>
<p>The mosaics combine very Jewish symbols such as the Binding of Isaac, a citron and palm frond, the ark of the covenant, and other uniquely Jewish symbols with Astrology and imagery reminiscent of Greek Gods. This is very confusing.</p>
<p>The well-behaved Jews were virulently against Pagan symbols in general. Certainly, they would not be welcome in a synagogue! Yet, it seems that these people also paid homage to the holy symbols of traditional Judaism. Quite the mystery indeed.<span id="more-6182"></span></p>
<p>In the article, Walter Zanger proposes that there was a large segment of Jews who were not rabbinic Jews. They had the same ancient traditions from the Bible as rabbinic Jews but they handled the quasi-enlightenment of the Hellenistic era in a very different way. They simply superimposed neo-pagan, Greek Philosophy on top of Judaism and them Judaism back on top of that. To them it was a natural progression from religious cult to enlightened post-Biblical culture. They cared passionately about Judaism, but it was just a different kind of Judaism. Zanger calls it &#8220;vertical&#8221;. That&#8217;s because the religion evolved from what we see in the Bible to what we see in the later prophets, to what we see in the non-Pharisee groups of Judaism, culminating with the practices present in these synagogues. One progresses from one to the next. Whereas, Pharisaic Judaism is horizontal. It is a more modern view of Biblical Judaism, but it is an attempt to remain true to the original Biblical path.</p>
<p>These synagogues were the places of prayer for a different tradition of Judaism in the sixth century. Much like the Sadducees or the Karaites or the Essenes who did not really survive the test of time, this group eventually vanished. But they clearly rejected the tradition that has been recorded and preserved in the Talmud and that is by and large practiced today by orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>The dogma of the vertical Judaism that Zanger describes is not necessarily offensive to our modern notions of Torah Judaism. Their belief was that there was a natural order as described by Greek Philosphy but Israel was above that natural order. This explains why the Jewish symbols were always above the Pagan symbols in the mosaic hierarchy. The God of Israel was supreme and the natural world was subject to God and the People of Israel were above the natural order because of their fealty to God. The offensive thing here is including this imagery in the synagogue. Further, they seemed to have rejected rabbinic Judaism as described in the Talmud. This rejection alone is sufficient to set them apart from our tradition.</p>
<p>Considering that this is a possibility, I think we gain insight into some of the fears of the rabbis in the Talmud. The things that they were careful to avoid and that they wanted to prevent could very well be represented by these synagogues and the religion associated with them. On the other hand, astrology is fairly prominent in the Talmud. I would not go so far as to say that the rabbis of the Talmud would endorse its imagery in the synagogue, but the they were definitely involved in astrology.</p>
<p>I am fairly certain that if you read the article, you will find it very interesting. If you don&#8217;t care for the content and analysis, you&#8217;ll still love the photos. So check out the article and let me know what you think.</p>

We are told that Samson was a great warrior and a great man. There are many details of his interactions with many different people including the Philistines.</p>
<p>When it comes to the details of the stories of the prophets, many people look to archeology as a way of proving or disproving the veracity of these stories. Recently a seal (not the kind you club) was found in an excavation in Israel that either means a lot or means nothing at all, which is all likelihood means that it means very little.<span id="more-6109"></span></p>
<p>A very small stone seal was found with a depiction of a very large animal and a human on its side. The story of Samson includes an episode where Samson wrestled a lion, and won. Some experts say that this seal is a reference to the story of Samson and the lion. Other experts say that it can&#8217;t prove that the story happened. At best it can prove that at the time this seal was made, people believed that the story of Samson and a lion happened. Or at worst that the same story that the Book of Prophets based its Samson story upon was known by the people who made the seal. Or at the very worst, that the story of Samson and the Lion has nothing to do with this seal. It&#8217;s all a coincidence.</p>
<p>So as you can see, this seal proves very little about the story of Samson. It does prove a lot about confirmation bias. Facts that are ambiguous are interpreted by people with preconceived ideas as proof for their preconceived ideas. I think it would be impossible to prove the truth of the stories of the Torah with archeology. All the excuses given above would work for almost any discovery. Similarly, it is almost impossible to disprove the Torah using archeology. Counter-evidence is not proof. Further, almost all discoveries are very open to interpretation.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean that I think archeology is a waste of time. I think we should accept it for what it is &#8211; a peek into a world we are shown through the the lens of Bible. That is extremely valuable and interesting. I know that I love to keep tabs of Biblical archeology. But to make it is into something more than that is just going to lead to disappointment and senseless arguing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jerusalem_archeological_dig-759529.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4604" title="jerusalem_archeological_dig-759529" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jerusalem_archeological_dig-759529-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>For centuries, a segment of orthodox Judaism has shunned science. It has been viewed as heretical and anti-Torah. When confronted with seemingly irreconcilable differences between science and Torah, the orthodox Jewish view is to choose Torah. So why bother with science if it will just cause theological problems?</p>
<p>This groups self identifies as Charedi Judaism. Charedi comes from the word חרד which means to fear. It is supposed to mean &#8220;fear of Heaven&#8221;. I have joked that it also means &#8220;fear of science&#8221; or &#8220;fear of progress&#8221; or &#8220;fear of education&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ha&#8217;aretz writes that a couple weeks ago, a Torah Archeology conference took place with the approval of Charedi Rabbis. While not entirely embracing the conclusions of archeology, the conference presented a view of archeology that is entirely compatible with Charedi Judaism. The artifacts are used to illuminate the Torah and its interpreters. But never used to challenge them.<span id="more-4603"></span></p>
<p>Certainly this is a fine line to tread and one that this community has been reluctant to tread for centuries. But it seems that at least a small portion of them and their leaders are prepared to embrace Torah Archeology.</p>
<p>This is wonderful news.</p>
<p>It is all part of a broader effort to [slightly] modernize the Charedi system to include improved education and prepare Charedi adults for a less insular life. The article in Haaretz quotes Rabbi Eliyahu Soloveitchick (who I do not know nor do I know his Charedi credentials) as saying that science and Torah can and should be reconciled. He even mentions the &#8220;E&#8221; Word. He says that evolution is not a problem for believers. He should tell that to the anti-evolution ideologues in America&#8230;</p>
<p>The money quote from Rabbi Soloveitchik:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re all Haredim who are guided by the fear of heaven, but that&#8217;s not a reason to be afraid of science. The Haredi fear of science is gradually dissipating.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It all sounds revolutionary to me and we shall see if it will catch on. I am afraid that this movement will be banned and its participants ostracized as has happened in the past.</p>
<p>But the truth is, that this was inevitable. Insularity and &#8220;protection&#8221; from modernity can only work so long as that insulation and protection are absolute. But once there are cracks in the wall, the floodgates are open. It is impossible, in 2011, to maintain that level of rigorous insularity. The Internet and free flow of information changed all that. It is what inspired revolution across the Middle East this past year and it is certainly what is fueling this trend toward science that is being alleged in this article about Torah archeology.</p>
<p>There are cracks in the walls of insularity. It is impossible to stop it. It is impossible for Charedi Jews, it is impossible for fundamentalist Muslims and Christians as well.</p>
<p>Christopher Hitchens has written and talked about the modernization of religion. In today&#8217;s day and age, it seems impossible to avoid. Adapt or disappear.</p>
<p>It seems that the Charedi world is getting ready to take that step.</p>

<p>Last year I bought this book right after Purim and was so thoroughly impressed that I said to myself that when the time comes next year I will promote this book and urge everyone to read it.</p>
<p>I know the author, Rabbi Landy from an incredible summer experience where he was the chief tour guide. We spent 5 weeks traveling the Land of Israel. Rabbi Landy is an expert in Tanach and very educated on archeology as well as Jewish history from a religious and secular perspective. Rabbi Landy is the absolute best &#8220;technical&#8221; tour guide I have had the pleasure of meeting.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MSYNLI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004MSYNLI">The Persian Empire</a>, Rabbi Landy shows off his extensive knowledge of Tanach, Talmudic and Midrashic sources, archeology and history. The book provides a historical backdrop for the Purim story and Purim story comes to life.<span id="more-3840"></span></p>
<p>The most fabulous part of the book is the photos. Rabbi Landy has compiled gorgeous pictures of artifacts from ancient Persia. Further Rabbi Landy has connected many statements of Chazal with those photos. For example, the famous dictum of the sages that the Babylonians were foolish because they drank wine in golden goblets which ruin the taste is illustrated by the actual golden goblets that were used. It really is incredible.</p>

<p>In the introduction, Rabbi Landy expresses his hope that this will be first of many books using archeological data to illustrate stories from Tanach. Rabbi Landy, I am waiting eagerly&#8230;</p>
