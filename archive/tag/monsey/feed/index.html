The topic was this: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/30/great-idea-terrible-execution/">Great Idea, Terrible Execution</a>.</p>
<p>My shul is in a place that might be more diverse than anywhere else in the world. My worldview is the complete opposite from the worldview of insular chasidic Jews in Monsey. So perhaps the idea was to use my experience in Venice to brainstorm ways to nudge the insular community towards a bit more tolerance and integration.</p>
<p>We were joined by Reverend Weldon McWilliams IV who has become the face of the Wake Up Rockland activist group. He is a wonderful fellow and I enjoyed our time together.</p>
<p>It was an interesting conversation and does dovetail into a passion of mine. Helping people and communities understand one another is very important to me and I hope that our conversation today can be the start of a journey toward more unity in Monsey.</p>

<p><em>Sorry about the mini blog-cation. I think I am back.</em></p>
<p>On Friday in downtown Monsey a newly formed group of activists called Wake Up Rockland entered Rockland Kosher Supermarket, basically it&#8217;s the Pomegranate of Monsey. The group was led by a black reverend and was made up of a cross-section of non-Jews from the local community. They marched into the store, innocent frum Jews looked on, mouths agape, as the activists walked up and down the aisles looking for items to purchase. The store did not appreciate this gesture and they asked that the group leave.</p>
<p>The group had summoned the media to be present at the demonstration and the local paper wrote about the effort. The article seems to praise the activists and is lukewarm on the store people who were not receptive to the group.</p>
<p>Demonstrators explained that they were hoping to show the frum community that we are neighbors, they are not going anywhere, and we should try to integrate our communities a bit or at the very least try to get along.</p>
<p>I think this is a great idea. There is tension in Ramapo. There are non-Jews who are nasty to Jews and there are Jews who are nasty to non-Jews. It would be great if the two communities could somehow come together.</p>
<p>But there are a couple problems with the execution of this idea.<span id="more-7286"></span></p>
<p>First, the demonstrators seem to think that there is segregation in Ramapo. It&#8217;s not really segregation. It&#8217;s more like insularity. The frum community in Monsey wants to be insular and free from secular influences. So it&#8217;s not bigotry per se. In other words, bridging the gap is not a solution, it&#8217;s actually looked at as a problem for the frum community.</p>
<p>But more importantly, if the activists are genuine, and I have no reason to think they are not, they should work together with liaisons from the frum community to create harmony. No one wants to be surprised or forced into unity. Popping into Rockland Kosher on Friday may have worked for the cameras and for headlines, but it will not achieve the desired result unless members of the frum community participate in the decision-making and execution of ideas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really not that different than the situation in Israel with the charedim. Both situations needs insiders to make the change happen. But more importantly, the very philosophy and way of life that the charedim in Israel and Monsey live makes it nearly impossible to foster integration with non-charedim.</p>
<p>This kind of worldview is becoming more and more archaic and anachronistic. The world is less tolerant of insularity and isolation. The world desires integration, mutual respect, and harmony. The challenge for charedim will be how this approach to a global community can be reconciled with insularity, if it can at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mumps.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6422" title="mumps" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mumps-300x230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="230" /></a>In 2009 and 2010 there was an outbreak of mumps in three ultra-orthodox charedi Jewish communities. The concentration of the outbreak was in Monsey NY, two areas of Brooklyn NY, and Lakewood NJ. There is no question that the outbreak occurred.</p>
<p>The rabbinic leadership was cognizant of the outbreak and several rabbis issued rulings in response to the outbreak.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that the outbreak was the result of a tendency among some ultra-orthodox families to avoid vaccinating. Mumps has been reduced to the trash-heap of disease because an effective vaccine has been implemented for the last 40 years.<span id="more-6419"></span></p>
<p>However, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy#Full_retraction_and_fraud_allegations" target="_blank">recent study, that has since been debunked and retracted</a>, connected vaccines to autism. Some people took this as a warning not to vaccinate. There is anecdotal evidence that this thinking has taken a stronghold in some of the more ultra-orthodox communities. Subsequently, some rabbis ordered that all families vaccinate, other rabbis advised to vaccinate, other rabbis said that the public had no right to demand that other parents vaccinate. For a full treatment of this issue see the excellent article in Hakirah by Asher Bush: <a href="http://www.hakirah.org/Vol13Bush.pdf" target="_blank">Vaccination in Halakhah and in Practice in the Orthodox Jewish Community</a></p>
<p>So it seemed to the community that the reason for the increase in mumps was the decrease in vaccination vigilance in the community. I am not certain if this is sufficient to explain the outbreak. I am not an expert on this sort of medical analysis but it seems plausible that fewer vaccinations equals more cases and more cases means that the vaccine will be less protective against more challenges to its potency. Again, it makes sense to my mind. Perhaps this is due to a lack of understanding of these matters. But I bought it at the time.</p>
<p>Apparently, this possible solution was not satisfactory to actually doctors. Either they don&#8217;t know that there is a high number of non-vaccinated children in these neighborhoods, or this explanation does not pass scientific muster.</p>
<p>The New England Journal of Medicine published an article with their own solution to this puzzle.</p>
<p>Their opinion is that the cause of the outbreak was chavrusa learning. Orthodox Jewish teenage men study in yeshivas. They have a very rigorous schedule of secular and religious instruction. Much of the time spent on religious studies does not take place in a classroom. They study sitting across from one another at a table. One reads the other listens and interjects with corrections or questions and a discussion ensues. This style of learning is called chavrusa (study partner) learning.</p>
<p>The writers (and there are like 15 of them) of the article in the NEJM propose that prolonged exposure to mumps via a chavrusa could be the reason mumps spread among the ultra-orthodox community. Mumps can be spread through droplets and yelling at your chavrusa from close range can transmit mumps from one person to the next. Chavrusas vary throughout the day and this gives the mumps carrier even more opportunities to spread mumps around the community. Once a large number of teenage boys bring the mumps home, it spreads to the rest of the family.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s speculation. But it might be true. The doctors attached to this article seem to think it is compelling enough for the NEJM.</p>
<p>I do NOT think there is any way to spin this as an anti-Semitic position that seeks to eliminate chavrusa learning out of Jew hatred. What I do see is a way in which we are slightly different than our more secular neighbors and sometimes the smallest differences make the biggest difference. In this case it might have contributed to a mumps outbreak.</p>

My family still lives in Monsey so I always keep tabs on some the news and goings on in Monsey. This morning a fascinating post on LoHud.com (the Rockland County newspaper&#8217;s website).</p>
<p>The post confirms what everyone in Monsey and Rockland already knows, there has been a severe demographic shift over the last 30 years. You can see it with your eyes if you visit Rockland County and in particular Monsey. But seeing the data as presented by the post really drove home the stark reality.</p>
<p>According the post these are the most popular baby names over the last 30 years:<span id="more-2681"></span></p>
<p>The 5 most popular names in 1990:</p>
<p>Males: Michael, Christopher, Daniel, John, Matthew<br />
Females: Jessica, Amanda, Nicole, Samantha, Sarah</p>
<p>This represents a strong Anglo community. The names are typical of Christian families and middle to upper class Americans.</p>
<p>The 5 most popular names in 2000:</p>
<p>Males: Michael, Matthew, Joseph, John, Nicholas<br />
Females: Sarah, Samantha, Jessica, Nicole, Julia and Kayla (tied)</p>
<p>Again, a very typical list that is still consistent with a diverse community.</p>
<p>The 5 most popular names in 2008:</p>
<p>Males: Joseph, Michael, Moshe, David, Abraham<br />
Females: Esther, Rachel, Rivka, Chaya, Leah</p>
<p>Wow! All the names are consistent with Orthodox Jewish baby names. There are 0 Christian names. There are 0 female names that are not HEBREW! And there are 0 non-Jewish names for males.</p>
<p>Again, it just confirms what we all know. But the data makes it even more powerful.</p>
