				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best advertised features of the Purim story, as told in Megilat Esther, is the absence of God’s name. In fact, the story is perfectly viable without God playing any role in the tale. Much like our lives, the presence or absence of God is impossible to prove or disprove. Some people are able to see God’s trademark in everything, while others are incapable of seeing God in any part of their lives.</p>
<p>In book in the Jewish Biblical canon,  God’s conspicuous absence is particularly striking. These are the books of God, yet God is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, God’s absence in Megilat Esther is even more significant than most people realize.<span id="more-9139"></span><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/03/05/rabbis-hid-god-reason/esther-goes-to-the-king-to-plead-for-the-safety-o/" rel="attachment wp-att-9141"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9141" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Esther-goes-to-the-king-to-plead-for-the-safety-o.gif?fit=600%2C600" alt="Esther-goes-to-the-king-to-plead-for-the-safety-o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Esther was a late inclusion in the Biblical canon. The Talmud says it was written by the Anshei Knesset HaGedolah along with a few other late books. Within a few hundred years, another version of Esther crops up in Greek and Hebrew. One later version has additions throughout the text and these additions are footnoted in another later Esther text. All of the additions share one general guiding principle. They all add God into the story.</p>
<p>For example, Mordechai is shown a prophetic vision at the beginning of the narrative, and it comes true at the end of the story. Also, the prayers of Mordechai and Esther are included in some versions. In the non-Tanach version, God plays a starring role in the scene where Esther breaches protocol and sees the king unannounced. Many of the small additions are found in our Midrashic sources.</p>
<p>This means that our Tanach specifically did not include God in the text of the story, and when we had the opportunity to add it back into the text or to infuse a little bit of religion into the story, we rejected that option. It’s not merely that God wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the Megilah. It’s that God was deliberately omitted from Megilat Esther. Why?</p>
<p>The answers to this question are not really different than the answer to the question of why God is simply not mentioned in the text. Those answers still work. But the question changes, and that means there can also be new and different answers.</p>
<p>God may have been <em>reinserted</em> into the text for religious reasons. But not our religion. Christians also see significance in the story of Esther. Some say she was a proto-Mary. Others say that Esther was a proto-Jesus. Some even say that Esther’s bravery preserved the Jewish people and the Davidic line, which allowed their messiah to be born several centuries later. The point is that Christians used the book for very Christian teachings, and that might be a reason some people inserted God into the text.</p>
<p>At that time, the Christian god was very “present” and the Jewish God was very hidden. Thus, it also might be that the Jewish God of the time was a hidden God while the god of the Christians at that time was thought to be more readily accessible. Between a version of Esther with a hidden God and a version with a very active God, the Jewish path is clear. It was a time of great peril for the Jewish people. Giving up hope in the invisible God likely made the very active god of the early Christians and pagans much more attractive. The rabbis wanted to help avoid that kind of thinking, and instead they wanted to train people to see the Hidden God.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense that the rabbis declined to edit God into the text. They specifically wanted to give the hidden God to the Jewish people. This would be their God for the duration of exile. So the rabbis made the somewhat controversial decision to give us this one book starring a Hidden God. The rabbis of the Anshei Knesset HaGedola were right. Our God is the Hidden God. One day, our God will no longer be hidden, but until then, we have Esther.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In some Orthodox Jewish communities, almost everyone relates to their Judaism in a very similar way. Insular Chasidic communities are often the sort of community where everyone lives a very similar style of Jewish life and practices a very homogenous version of Judaism. Similarly, some Israeli settlement communities feature conformity and somewhat uniform Jewish experiences within their community.</p>
<p>But most Orthodox Jews live in relatively diverse communities where people enjoy different parts of their Jewish experiences in their own ways. Some might be more into meeting <em>Rebbehs</em> and <em>Gedolim</em> for blessings, others love learning Gemara, others seek out opportunities for <em>chessed,</em> yet others enjoy the music and singing and dancing, while others revel in Shabbos and Yom Tov. In other words, there are many different areas of focus that can give flavor and meaning to one&#8217;s subjective Judaism.<span id="more-8202"></span><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/martha103994pr_027_4x612.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-8203" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/martha103994pr_027_4x612.jpg?resize=420%2C344" alt="martha103994pr_027_4x612" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I think it would great to increase these options. We should be seeking more flavors of Judaism. Jewish experiences should be developed for Orthodox Jews with other areas of talent and expertise. It sometimes feels as if the modes of expression in Orthodox Judaism today were cutting edge at some point, but feel a little bit long in the tooth today.</p>
<p>One of the newer modes of Jewish expressions is something that my wife coined <strong>Martha Stewart Judaism</strong>™. (Which also happens to be her specialty.) This is the form of Judaism that finds great meaning and pleasure from the creative presentation of Judaism and its rituals. It&#8217;s the kind of Judaism that gave us gourmet cookbooks, party planner designed kiddushes, parsha cakes, out of this world Sukkah decorations, and amazing holiday crafts. The Super Bowl of Martha Stewart Judaism is almost certainly the upcoming holiday of Purim. The creative ideas, themes, and originality of Mishloach Manos and tying costumes into the theme for bonus points has become our modern version of the Purim celebration.</p>
<p>For many people, this is the part of Jewish life that they love most. It&#8217;s their favorite part of Judaism. That&#8217;s great. I am a huge proponent of exploring and exploiting new and exciting ways to inspire passionate Jewish engagement for Orthodox Jews. Martha Stewart Judaism is certainly a great example of finding niches to focus our passions within Orthodox Judaism. I love it.</p>
<p>The only problem is that sometimes the people who don&#8217;t love Martha Stewart Judaism feel pressure to conform to the standards that have been set astronomically high by the creative people. Not everyone likes finding a theme for Mishloach Manos. Some people just want to give a small grape juice with some rugelach in a Ziploc bag. But they feel like they can&#8217;t do that because of the social pressure. This is unfortunate. There is no rule that we all have to be Martha Stewarts. Not everyone gets pleasure out of that kind of expression of Judaism. It&#8217;s a shame that these people often feel negatively about these Jewish experiences because they feel pressure to conform to one particular form of Jewish expression.</p>
<p>This really applies to all kinds of different Jewish expression. Not everyone wants to &#8220;dance&#8221; (smash) in a &#8220;circle&#8221; (mosh pit) at a wedding. Not everyone enjoys singing <em>Zemiros</em> on Shabbos. Not everyone loves learning Talmud. One of our greatest strengths is that we provide a variety of acceptable Jewish expressions in Orthodox Judaism. We can&#8217;t force conformity to any particular version and if we do we risk alienating those who do not appreciate that they are being forced to conform. There are plenty of acceptable ways to express our Jewishness that we should not have to push ourselves to participate in programs and projects that don&#8217;t appeal to our personalities and talents.</p>
<p>It would also be nice if we could be less rigid about who participates in each flavor of Judaism. I am sure that there are many men who would love to be Martha Stewarts and there are probably women out there who would like to do some of the more typically male activities. Some non-Chasidic Jews might really love he <em>tish</em> and many Chasidic Jews might enjoy a class on Orthodox Biblical Scholarship. But these lines are rarely crossed. More choices and greater freedom to choose would be great.</p>
<p>I love that we have Martha Stewart Judaism. But I think that it also is a great test example of how we can sometimes box people into roles and rules that are not suited to them, thereby souring their Jewish experience. We can do a better job allowing people to find their niche within Orthodox Judaism and not enforcing arbitrary standards on everyone. This would be a great step forward in maintaining positive Orthodox Jewish experiences. And let&#8217;s not forget to see if we can think of ways that we can add more Orthodox Jewish experience opportunities that make sense in our modern world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of Pacific Jewish Center  | The Shul on the Beach we wish everyone a joyous and happy Purim. Revel responsibly!</p>
<p>Here are a couple photos of the PJC Mishloach Manos and the accompanying poem. Special thanks to my wife Tova for designing the Mishloach Manos and all the helpers who put the bags together. Enjoy!<span id="more-5253"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_0673.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5254 aligncenter" title="IMG_0673" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_0673-e1331227711953-1024x768.jpg?resize=614%2C461" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_0676.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5256 aligncenter" title="IMG_0676" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_0676-e1331227793974-1024x768.jpg?resize=614%2C461" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">From time to time, people like to take a trip to the beach<br />
They go as far as they can, until the shore they reach</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Everyone takes a bag when they go on a little trip<br />
Whether going for some sun or a little dip</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Our Pacific Jewish Center bag is packed for a picnic lunch<br />
With lots of goodies to snack on and things to munch</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We are the famous Shul on the Beach, with a unique position<br />
Helping us spread the light of Hashem’s Torah is our mission</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Thousands walk by our shul searching for something, every week<br />
For the special ones who join us, it is inspiration they seek</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But everyone lbenefits from the shul’s presence as a reminder<br />
That as lost as someone might be, there is also always a Finder</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We elevate the boardwalk from pure materialism to something higher<br />
It is a model of Kiddush Hashem and our power to inspire</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Just like the Purim story takes a tale of seemingly coincidence and chance<br />
And transforms it to a joyous and spiritual holiday of love, friendship, song, and dance</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">By our acts and commitment we transform the spiritual wasteland outside<br />
The good must be victorious when spiritual and material worlds collide</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Similarly we transform simple picnic foods like meat, condiments, and beer<br />
Into a holy mitzvah that lifts spirits and brings good cheer</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Let’s take this Purim lesson and continue to teach the world its truth<br />
It shall be known everywhere, take this world and make it holy, every adult and every youth</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Happy Purim</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>From your friends at Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite unccoperative weather, Purim at the Shul on the Beach was enjoyed by all. As a community we performed all the mitzvos of the day.</p>
<p>Beginning with the packing of Mishloach Manos on the Fast of Esther we spent time together celebrating one of the joyous periods of the Jewish calendar. The packing event was a success. Firstly because the Mishloach Manos got packed. But more importantly, those who attended connected to each other through a mitzva and that is a special connection. I need to thank my wife <strong>Tova</strong> for designing, ordering and creating the entire custom Mishloach Manos as well as organizing and compiling the PJC Yam Yam Salad Cookbook that was printed and included in every Mishloach Manos package.</p>
<p>After Shabbos we collected Matanos L&#8217;evyonim and heard the megilla read beautifully by <strong>Hillel Philip</strong> while many were dressed in their Purim costumes. He did an excellent job and we celebrated with Hamentashen after the reading. During Purim day, the Mishloach Manos were delivered by PJC volunteers spearheaded by <strong>Alan Danziger</strong> with the assistance of <strong>Leslie Friedman</strong>. It wasn&#8217;t easy to do in the rain, but all the packages were delivered. In the afternoon we had a party for the community which was deliciously catered by <strong>Mr. Pickles </strong>and organized by <strong>Jeff Liss</strong> with some assistance by <strong>Frederic Eger</strong>. It was a lot of fun to celebrate the joy of Purim together. If not for the inclement weather I am sure many more neighobrs and passers-by on the boardwalk would have joined us. But it was pouring rain and the boardwalk was deserted.</p>
<p>They missed and we enjoyed a great show by Alula. We danced, sang, ate and reveled through the afternoon. Purim at the Shul on the Beach was a wonderful kiddush Hashem and we hope next year we will be blessed with better weather and some more guests from outside the community.</p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A </span><span style="color: #888888;">guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Purim<br />
A Time To Know</h2>
<p>The notorious antagonist of the Purim saga is none other than the Amalekite, Haman. Chazal wonder, where can we find a hint to the existence of Haman and his nefarious plan to annihilate the Jewish people? They teach us that the phrase in Parshas Bereishis which describes Hashem Yisborach confronting Adam Harishon regarding the sin of eating from the Etz Hada’as, “Hamin haetz asher tzivisicha l’vilti achol mimenu achalta” is a remez to Haman. The word hamin and Haman have identical Hebrew letters. This needs further clarification. What does eating of the Etz Hada’as have to do with the Purim story at all? Moreover, there is an additional Medrash which says that the tree on which Haman was hanged was also the Etz Hada’as. How could the same tree be both the remez to the plot of Haman and be as well, the symbol of his ultimate downfall? To understand this further, we must shed some light on the essence of Amalek and his impact on Klal Yisrael.<span id="more-3932"></span></p>
<p>The Baal Haturim points out that the word Amalek shares the same gematria as the word safek. He teaches us, that it is Amalek who plants the seeds of doubt regarding our emunah, our connection to Hashem, and our responsibilities to behave as an am segula. Haman fostered and capitalized on these doubts by advising King Achashveirosh to invite the Jews to his feast. These doubts which epitomize the power of Amalek to separate us from the Shechina are actually rooted in the very first sin.</p>
<p>Before eating from the Etz Hada’as, Adam and Chava had clarity. They knew Hashem Yisborach. In the utopian world of Gan Eden, they were able to focus totally on the spiritual. Indeed, they never even noticed their own need for clothes. Their physical world was insignificant and they enjoyed the spiritual nirvana that was Gan Eden. However, upon eating from the Etz Hada’as, doubts crossed that reality. They were ashamed. Suddenly, that clarity of spiritual perspective was now clouded with shades of insecurity and disbelief that corrupts are hearts and minds till this very day.</p>
<p>This power to instill doubt, even among the faithful, is the secret weapon used by Amelek in his attempt to destroy the Jewish people and their belief in Hashem. It was Haman’s tool as well. Like his antecedent, Amalek, Haman used its corrupting power rooted in the first sin in Garden of Eden in his attempt to annihilate us all.</p>
<p>What was the response then and what should it be today? While it is true that the eye opening knowledge introduced to the world through the eating of the Etz Hada’as brought about safek, we also know that the only process to eradicate doubt is to acquire knowledge. The megilla tells us,  “v’Mordechai yada es kol asher na’asa-” Mordechai knew what was happening and he used this power of knowledge to eradicate Klal Yisrael’s doubts of their nitzchiyus and their relationship with the Ribbono Shel Olam. True, seventy years of golus had just about passed, but netzach Yisroel lo Yishaker, the geula would come. Klal Yisrael could and would continue their sacred mission as yodei Hashem, making His presence known to all of civilization. The antidote to Amalek, the cure to absorbing the insecurities presented by the Etz Hada’as is to become a stronger yodea, a more knowledgeable Jew. As Klal Yisrael, strengthened their yedia of Hashem and His Torah through tefilla and kabbalas Hatorah as described in the Megilla, they fashioned the weapon that would lead to Haman’s demise.</p>
<p>It is no different today. Purim is a time to know. The more we know, the better we learn and the more we live with the maxim of haphach bah v’haphich bo d’kula ba, the better we can eradicate Amalek and the dispersions he casts up our emunah still today. Yes, Haman was hung on the Etz Hada’as, not the dangerous small bits of knowledge that breed doubt, but the surety of knowledge which yields competence and confidence, a confidence so strong, we can reach the level of ad d’lo yada and still know what’s right and wrong with all our heart and soul.</p>
<p>Chag Purim Sameach</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3917" title="The Queen You Thought You Knew" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/book_cover-1-221x300.png?resize=221%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />Purim is a few days away, but I have a late entry for Purim reading. I recommend Rabbi David Fohrman’s<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983269017/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0983269017" target="_blank"> The Queen You Thought You Knew</a>. If you order it today, you can get it before Shabbos and read the book before Purim. It is an easy read and the book is not too long.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983269017/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0983269017" target="_blank">The Queen You Thought You Knew</a> is worthwhile addition to your library. Rabbi Fohrman discusses a novel approach to the Purim story. His work is mostly speculative but presented reasonably and in my opinion, responsibly.</p>
<p>The premise of the book is that there are many many questions that remain unanswered in the Megilla which can be answered with the novel approach of Rabbi Forhman. Many of the questions in the book have been asked and answered by Chazal or more recent rabbis. But I am not aware of any holistic solution to some of the more well known and lesser known challenges within the Megilla narrative.<span id="more-3915"></span></p>
<p>Rabbi Forhman takes us on a journey of question, thought and theory to find answers and ultimately his novel approach.</p>
<p>I won’t ruin the book in this post but I will say that it is nothing like anything you have heard before. The book is clearly well researched and well thought out.</p>
<p>Although I wholeheartedly recommend this book. But there is one small caveat. It is important to note that Rabbi Fohrman’s theory is almost completely unsubstantiated in Chazal or other classical sources. It is almost entirely novel and based purely on the text of the Megilla. Rabbi Fohrman himself seems to forewarn of this throughout the book by hedging the theory of the book as speculative and a possibility not to the exclusion of any other idea. To some, this may be a great accomplishment. To others it may be controversial. I think it is a worthwhile read if only for the questions presented and the very novel solution as tenuous as it may be.</p>
<p>While using an academic style of study, the book fails to use any external corroborative materials to support its flimsy premise. In fact, I think the historical record would indicate that the premise is wrong. In my mind, if you&#8217;re going to use academic methodology, you should provide some scholarly support for your premise. This is the biggest and most glaring flaw of the book. Outside of this critique the book&#8217;s premise is elegant and useful.</p>
<p>It is also worthwhile to discuss the merits and demerits of the style of study the book represents. It is a departure from typical yeshiva style study in that it is more similar to academic text-based study. This is different than almost every other Torah book that is studied in the yeshiva milieu. It remains to be seen if this will become a more popular form of study or if it will be shunned by the yeshiva fraternity.</p>
<p>This last issue is being discussed in my post on DovBear: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/03/is-rabbi-fohrmans-purim-book.html">Is Rabbi Fohrman&#8217;s Purim Book Controversial?</a></p>

I can think of no better way to prepare than to buy and read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MSYNLI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004MSYNLI">Purim and The Persian Empire &#8211; By Rabbi Yehuda Landy.</a></p>
<p>Last year I bought this book right after Purim and was so thoroughly impressed that I said to myself that when the time comes next year I will promote this book and urge everyone to read it.</p>
<p>I know the author, Rabbi Landy from an incredible summer experience where he was the chief tour guide. We spent 5 weeks traveling the Land of Israel. Rabbi Landy is an expert in Tanach and very educated on archeology as well as Jewish history from a religious and secular perspective. Rabbi Landy is the absolute best &#8220;technical&#8221; tour guide I have had the pleasure of meeting.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MSYNLI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004MSYNLI">The Persian Empire</a>, Rabbi Landy shows off his extensive knowledge of Tanach, Talmudic and Midrashic sources, archeology and history. The book provides a historical backdrop for the Purim story and Purim story comes to life.<span id="more-3840"></span></p>
<p>The most fabulous part of the book is the photos. Rabbi Landy has compiled gorgeous pictures of artifacts from ancient Persia. Further Rabbi Landy has connected many statements of Chazal with those photos. For example, the famous dictum of the sages that the Babylonians were foolish because they drank wine in golden goblets which ruin the taste is illustrated by the actual golden goblets that were used. It really is incredible.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MSYNLI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004MSYNLI">The Persian Empire</a> has tons of interesting facts and opinions. It really leaves you wanting more.</p>
<p>In the introduction, Rabbi Landy expresses his hope that this will be first of many books using archeological data to illustrate stories from Tanach. Rabbi Landy, I am waiting eagerly&#8230;</p>
<p>In short, run, don&#8217;t walk to purchase this book. Get it from Amazon by clicking here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MSYNLI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004MSYNLI">Purim and The Persian Empire or try your local Jewish book store. If they don&#8217;t have it. Demand it. You&#8217;ll thank me later.</a></p>

It was Purim and they wanted to take pictures, talk with me and some of our Shul members and join in our Purim Celebration.</p>
<p>Never ones to turn down inviting strangers into the Shul, we welcomed them.</p>
<p>As I wrote at the time, our Purim Celebration was really special as we welcomed anyone and everyone off the boardwalk into our Shul. Read more here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/01/pacific-jewish-center-purim-celebration-recap-february-28-2010/">Pacific Jewish Center Purim Celebration Recap February 28, 2010</a></p>
<p>Nancy took beautiful candid photos and David kind of blended in with the rest of us<span id="more-2382"></span> talking to us and learning about the Pacific Jewish Center and the festival of Purim.</p>
<p>Purim is a funny time to be introduced to new people. Things are a little different on Purim. But David managed to get to know us in a way that I never thought an outsider could.</p>
<p>Nancy and David produced a wonderful photo-film of their visit. It is part of their Escape Into America Series. The series is incredible. They have managed to find a lot of soul throughout their travels and it really comes through in their work.</p>
<p>In the photo-film about us, they did a really super job cutting through it all and finding the soul of our shul.</p>
<p>There are a couple things in the photo-film that are not perfectly precise, but that&#8217;s okay. (2 minor corrections: 1- I did mention to David that Purim costumes were likely borrowed for the Venice Carnival in the 15th Century and yet costumes fit in well with the themes of the day, 2- I am not sure I actually said that the Shul was in danger of disappearing &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t, rather, it could have been on that path).</p>
<p>Other than a couple minor mistakes the photo-film really captures the essence of Purim in our Shul as well as much of the essence of who we are at Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>The video stars everyone, but Yosef Beithalachmi (aka Mr. Pickles) and Ashi Bersin are featured in the voice-over. Great job!</p>

<p>This Purim, The Shul On The Beach opened its doors to the entire Venice / Santa Monica community to join in a Purim Celebration. An excellent turnout from our members, friends and neighbors set the stage for a truly memorable afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Beithalachmi prepared a wonderful Purim feast that was partially sponsored by Yossi and Joannie Ziff on the occasion of their second anniversary. As always, Jeff Liss planned an excellent party, including first class entertainment (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/28/alula-performs-at-pacific-jewish-center-purim-party-in-venice/" target="_blank">see the previous post</a>), refreshments and a costume contest. Most importantly, our community really stepped up to the plate in terms of hospitality, friendliness and warmth. Led, once again, by Rabbi Mintz, many, many guests were ushered into the Shul.<span id="more-2185"></span></p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting neighbors who had simply never dropped by the Shul, Israelis on vacation, random folks on Venice Boardwalk who wanted to stop in, children, elderly people, Jews, non-Jews, religious and otherwise. We tried to take photos with as many people as possible and you can check out the slideshow of photos below. [If you have any photos to add, PLEASE email them to me and I will add them!]
<p>Guests enjoyed hamentaschen, the lively music and touring our Shul. As always, we enjoyed meeting so many people from so many different backgrounds and situations and sharing the joy of Purim with them.</p>
<p>There was a small contingency from the press (MSNBC.com) that joined us throughout Purim. They were at the reading of the Scroll of Esther on Purim evening and returned for the today&#8217;s celebration. It was so much fun getting to know them and sharing our Purim with them. We look forward to seeing the fruits of their labor sometime in April. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
<p>The gathering was lively and inspiring. I spoke briefly about the meaning of our commandment to remember Amalek. Amalek attacked the Jewish people just after the Exodus from Egypt. They focused their attack on the stragglers. I expressed my hope that as a community we would not allow any stragglers. We must be inclusive and help everyone to feel that they are in the center of the group. There can be no fringe group if we are to &#8220;defeat&#8221; Amalek. Today&#8217;s event was a strong step in that direction.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you to all of you who helped and joined and made the event the festive celebration it was.</p>
<p>We are planning more events of this nature in the future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Purim Night at the Shul on the Beach was amazing.</p>
<p>On Sunday a number of volunteers from the community distributed <a href="http://www.jewishrecipes.org/jewish-foods/hamantaschen.html" target="_blank">Hamentaschen </a>to passersby on the Venice Boardwalk.

<p>A lot of those people joined us for the Purim Party at the Shul on the Beach Monday night. We hope we will see them again soon!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>As we have learned more and more about Purim many people have danced around the subject of Yom Kippur and Purim.

<p>Tonight we continued our learning about Purim. Often misunderstood and misused, Purim deserves better treatment than that.</p>
<p>We journeyed through the book of Genesis, The Scroll of Esther and the Talmud in search of meaning and reason. Why is Purim named after the lottery that Haman cast? Why did Haman cast a lottery?</p>
<p>We answered a lot of questions tonight. The basic idea is universal but much of it is in the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shneur_Kotler" target="_blank">Rabbi Shneur Kotler</a>.</p>

We journeyed through the book of Genesis, The Scroll of Esther and the Talmud in search of meaning and reason. Why is Purim named after the lottery that Haman cast? Why did Haman cast a lottery?
