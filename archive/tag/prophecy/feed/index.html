				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Nuremberg_chronicles_f_30r_2.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7279" alt="Nuremberg_chronicles_f_30r_2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Nuremberg_chronicles_f_30r_2-300x215.png" width="300" height="215" /></a>“And he said to them: &#8216;Lodge here this night, and I will bring you back word, as the LORD may speak to me&#8217;; and the princes of Moab abode with Bilaam. And G-D came to Balaam, and said: &#8216;What men are these with you?&#8217; And Bilaam said to G-D: &#8216;Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me…” &#8211; Numbers 22:8-10</em></p>
<p>Balak hires Bilaam to curse the Israelites so that Balak would beat them in battle. In addition to being a sought after sorcerer, Bilaam was a prophet. When we meet Bilaam he consults with G-D about this business opportunity. Their conversation indicates that Bilaam had quite a high level of prophecy and regularly spoke with G-D.</p>
<p>Our Sages explain that Bilaam was a great prophet and he was a necessary piece in G-D’s infinite plan. In order to rebut a possible argument by the Nations of the World that they too would have been as righteous as the Israelites if they had their own prophet as great as Moses, G-D gave them Bilaam.</p>
<p>The problem is that according to many commentaries Bilaam was a terrible person. Following his failed attempt to curse the Israelites he suggested a much less esoteric plan and far more practical. Bilaam advised Balak to send the maidens of Midian to seduce the Israelites. Only a wicked person would concoct such a disgusting plan. But if Bilaam was so evil, why was he the prophet chosen by G-D as the prophet of the Nations of the World? It hardly seems fair. The Nations of the World will simply demand a righteous prophet.</p>
<p>Further, assuming he was a wicked man the rest of the story is quite perplexing. Bilaam is rebuffed by an Angel of G-D and his donkey tries to convince him to reconsider his decision to curse the Israelites. Why is G-D sending Bilaam so many messages and giving him so many opportunities to turn around? Bilaam is a bad guy! Bad guys don’t get this kind of treatment from G-D! They are left to their own choices and they must live with the consequences.<span id="more-7273"></span></p>
<p>It seems that these questions might answer one another.</p>
<p>G-D had high hopes for Bilaam. He was supposed to be a great prophet. He was supposed to be almost as great as Moses. That was the Divine Plan.</p>
<p>Bilaam had all the tools to be just a notch below Moses. He was given incredible talents and abilities. G-D expected Bilaam to use these gifts properly. Bilaam was supposed to teach and inspire the Nations of the World. That was to be his role. Unfortunately he did not.</p>
<p>It’s not a question on G-D why the prophet of the Nations of the World was not a righteous person. It was Bilaam’s own fault. It was his choices that made him the person who he was.</p>
<p>This also explains the rest of the story. G-D was so hopeful, k’vyachol, that Bilaam would prove to be the prophet he was meant to be. The entire purpose of Bilaam’s purpose as a prophet was to be answer to the possible complaint of the Nations of the World that they had prophet like Moses. G-D so badly wished, k’vyachol, that Bilaam would be that prophet. G-D went to great lengths to help Bilaam be that man.</p>
<p>G-D tried to dissuade Bilaam from joining Balak’s emissaries. G-D places an angel of G-D in Bilaam’s path. G-D opened the mouth of a donkey to talk some sense into Bilaam. All these efforts were to preserve Bilaam’s purity in the hope that he could be the prophet the Nations of the World needed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it did not work out the way G-D planned. Bilaam was undeterred and fell into the depths of the spiritual abyss. G-D does not control Bilaam’s righteousness. Only Bilaam can control that. As much as G-D, k’vyachol, would have loved for Bilaam to be like Moses, it was not within G-D’s control to make that happen.</p>
<p>Seeing this sliver of G-D is profoundly inspiring. The Bilaam saga shows us a G-D who is cheering us from the sidelines. Ours is a G-D who so badly wants us to succeed, k’vyachol. G-D was rooting for Bilaam and G-D is rooting for us.</p>
<p>Life presents us with challenges and we can find ourselves frustrated by our failures. We might question whether we can fulfill our mission in life. It can be a lonely world.</p>
<p>The story of how interested G-D was in Bilaam’s success is so reassuring and comforting to us today. G-D wanted Bilaam to vanquish his demons and prevail in his challenges. G-D does the same for us. Like a father rooting for his child at a Little League game, the Bilaam saga tells us that G-D wants us to win and G-D wants us to be heroes in our personal battles.</p>
<p>More than the narrative of the failed curses of Bilaam, we learn from the story something very profound that impacts our relationship with G-D. We see what it means to live in a world with a caring, loving G-D. We see what it means to have a relationship with G-D. It means that we can count on our biggest Fan cheering us on and motivating us to succeed.</p>
<p>Our job description as parents, teachers, and role models is to emulate the way G-D interacts with us. There are people who turn to us for love and support. We must make sure that they know that we are following the lead of G-D and we are permanently in their corner cheering them on. Children especially need to know that we are there for them no matter what. We cannot live their lives for them but they must feel our love and care so that they can meet life’s challenges with the confidence to know that no matter what their parents are their rock to lean upon for strength.</p>
<p>Similarly in our personal relationships, we must cheer for one another. Another person’s success must be viewed as our success. When we stand behind one another and hope for the best for everyone around us, we too are emulating G-D. We also reap the rewards of living in the loving, caring society of our dreams. &#8211; Good Shabbos</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JudahEmblem.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6521" title="JudahEmblem" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/JudahEmblem.png" alt="" width="150" height="214" /></a>In what has become a familiar refrain, the Torah Temimah in Parshas Vayetze takes the most expansive position available with regard to women prophetesses.</p>
<p>In Vayetze, Leah and Yaakov have a bunch of children who eventually become half of the tribes of Israel. In naming her fourth son, Leah decides to thank God &#8220;this time&#8221;. The commentaries wonder why Leah is thanking God &#8220;this time&#8221;. Rashi explains that she was giving thanks for taking &#8220;more than her portion&#8221;. The idea is that there were four women who were the mothers of the tribes to be and there were to be 12 tribes. If each mother got her equal share they would each bear three sons. Leah was now on her fourth so she realized she was getting &#8220;more than she thought she was getting&#8221;. For this she thanked God.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah tells us that Rashi is quoting a Midrash Raba and that Leah knew this information because she saw it with <em>ruach hakodesh. </em>He then quotes a Maharsha that says that this cannot be a prophecy because Leah is not included in the list of twelve prophetesses in the first chapter of (Babylonian Talmud) Megillah 14A. Rather she made this proclamation with no intent and God placed it in her lips to speak of the future. The Torah Temimah remarks that this is very hard pill to swallow.<span id="more-6520"></span></p>
<p>So instead, the Torah Temimah says, and there is no need to quote him here so I will paraphrase, that all the matriarchs were prophetesses. He uses a Midrash Socher Tov to support this assertion as that Midrash makes a drasha to make the same point. He goes on to say that there are competing opinions among the rabbinic commentators and there are sources on each side of the debate. Therefore, one cannot ask from one source to the other.</p>
<p>Nothing too groundbreaking here, but the overall point is that once again the Torah Temimah is trying his best to include women as potential prophetesses. And for that we thank him.</p>
<p>Also, I think it is clear from the Maharsha and the Torah Temimah that <em>ruach hakodesh </em>would be considered prophecy. I am pretty sure this is the opinion of Maimonides. What&#8217;s interesting, is that it seems that one cannot posses <em>ruach hakodesh </em> unless one is a candidate for prophecy. Are there any opinions who claim authentic prophecy is possible today? Can we authoritatively rule out<em> ruach hakodesh</em> as well? At least according to this Maharsha? I think so.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ushpizin61.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6493" title="7prohetesses" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ushpizin61-283x300.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="300" /></a>You&#8217;ll recall that last week I wrote about the Torah Temimah&#8217;s opinion of R&#8217; Meir as it relates to women. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/11/12/an-interesting-torah-temimah-on-nashim-datan-kalot/">An Interesting Torah Temimah on Nashim Datan Kalot</a>) This week I discovered another interesting comment from the Torah Temimah that I think is also significant but not as significant.</p>
<p>Parshas Toldos begins with a confused Rivkah wondering why she was experiencing a very strange pregnancy. The passuk says וַתֵּלֶךְ, לִדְרֹשׁ אֶת-יְהוָה. Rivkah went to inquire with God. The verse does not say how exactly she made this inquiry.</p>
<p>The commentaries offer two main options. 1) She inquired with a prophet. 2) She prayed to God (Ramban).</p>
<p>The Torah continues and tells us: ,&#8230;וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה לָהּ &#8211; God said to her&#8230; Here the commentaries say that she was answered via prophecy. It could be that the Ramban would say that she was answered directly, but he does not comment on these words.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah mentions some speculation that the reason that God did not speak to her directly was because as a general rule God does not speak to women (save for Sarah) as per the Jerusalem Talmud in Sota (7:1) (apologies to Michelle Bachmann). However, the Torah Temimah directs us to his commentary in Parshas Vayera where the Torah tells us that God spoke directly to Sarah. Here he quotes the Jerusalem Talmud and then expands on it in his commentary.<span id="more-6490"></span></p>
<p>Here is what he says  (translation my own, parentheticals are my additions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This exegesis requires explanation in general, because we have seen several women who were prophetesses, as the (Babylonian) Talmud counts on 14A, Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Chana, Avigayil, Chuldah, Esther, and is so how is it that the Jerusalem Talmud says that we do not find God talking with women, since these women were prophetesses he must have spoke to them!?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And me must say that God&#8217;s talking with the prophetesses must have been with regard to public matters, whereas with regard to private matters God only spoke directly with Sarah. And that which it says when God spoke to Eve and Rebecca it must have been with a go-between as we explained there.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Also we can answer this question according to that which is written in the Guide (for the Perplexed by Maimonides) chapter 45, where he counts 11 levels of prophecy, and the level of prophecy for women is until the seventh level, look there, and according to this it can be said that the intent here (Jerusalem Talmud) is that Sarah reached the level of prophecy that is the pinnacle of prophecy, and that is the level of prophecy of (King) Solomon, and this is not the place to expound further.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a huge thing, but I see this as the Torah Temimah trying to &#8220;soften the blow&#8221;. The Jerusalem Talmud takes a very harsh stance towards women and their spiritual capabilities and the Torah Temimah doesn&#8217;t think that this is a great message. In classic rabbinic form he reinterprets the statement from the Jerusalem Talmud to make it much more palatable. It&#8217;s not women&#8217;s liberation propaganda. It&#8217;s not going to be in JOFA&#8217;s literature. But it is something. It might be an acknowledgement from a great Torah scholar that taken at face value, this is an offensive statement towards women.</p>
<p>I think that most women would feel more comfortable serving God that does talk to women than a God who does not talk to women. It could be that the Torah Temimah was trying to ensure that women not be led to believe that the simple reading of the Jerusalem Talmud is the only authority on the matter.</p>
<p>Then again, it might just be a commentator trying to reconcile contradictory statements. But I think that every exegete chooses their battles. The fact that the Torah Temimah chose this battle shows me something.</p>
<p>Read the Torah Temimah here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/seferid_14052_page_171.pdf" target="_blank">Toldos</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/seferid_14052_page_239.pdf" target="_blank">Vayera</a></p>
