				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Atlantic takes note of a growing class of Americans. Fewer people identify as religious, but more people identify as spiritual. It&#8217;s far more common to believe in God than it is to be affiliated with a religion. Over 30% of people under 30 claim no religious preference. This might sound like they are all atheists. But over 70% of these same people who are not part of any religion believe in God.</p>
<p>Historically, these sort of people were dismissed. They were considered not to be serious about life and social issues. This might be changing. The article in The Atlantic argues that the political party that is able to tap into the needs of this emerging group will gain an advantage in future elections.</p>
<p>I see this trend in a different light.<span id="more-8055"></span></p>
<p>There are two main groups of religious people. One group is very spiritual. They follow God&#8217;s instructions in order that they should achieve spiritual gain. Perhaps they are interested in the spiritual rewards of the afterlife. Or maybe they are just afraid of the burning fires of hell. These people pay attention to what I call the Giant Scoreboard in the Sky. Others believe that every good deed they do will affect the world in a spiritual way. A sort of spiritual butterfly effect or religious form of Karma.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/photo-28.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8056" alt="photo (28)" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/photo-28.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The second group is more concerned with tangible effects of religious observance. They see God&#8217;s instructions as a moral imperative to act in a way that improves their lives and the lives of the people around them. This groups believes that the spiritual benefits to religious practice are unknowable and undetectable so they prefer to focus on the more social benefits of their religion.</p>
<p>To illustrate: One person might accept Jesus as their God and savior because they want to be spared eternal damnation. Another person might believe in Jesus because it enables them to be a better friend or spouse. Same result, but different motivations.</p>
<p>Another example: One person might keep the Sabbath because they know that keeping the Sabbath is good for the spiritual state of the universe and they will reap the rewards of this spiritual activity in the next world. Someone else might keep the Sabbath because they think God&#8217;s instruction that we rest one day per week will be good for them because it will give them an opportunity to focus on religious activity and their family. Same result, but different motivations.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think either of these paradigms are absolute. Some people will mix and match elements from both groups in their observance. I also think both of these paradigms are acceptable. Some people would never be able to adhere to religion if they had to go all in on either of these ideas. Some people are spiritually averse. Others need spirituality to sustain their observance.</p>
<p>But I think that the rise of spiritualists who do not believe in religion slightly threatens the second group. If more people become spiritualists and fewer people carry the mantle of appreciation for the social benefits of religion it will become harder and harder to sustain the second group.</p>
<p>Even if it&#8217;s not a threat per se, it indicates a trend toward more spiritual forms of religions. My own anecdotal experiences corroborate this trend. I notice more and more people taking an interest in more spiritually centric forms of Judaism. If the words &#8220;mystical,&#8221; &#8220;kabbalah,&#8221; or &#8220;secret&#8221; appear in the title to a class it generates more interest than a title without those words. When people meet me for the first time and they ask questions about Judaism, they are skewed toward the spiritual side of things. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this of course, but for people who fit more neatly into our second group, it can be alienating.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that this is all happening while the world is also trending away from belief and religion. It seems that the more atheism and rejection of God our world experiences, the more we see an increased interest in more spiritual forms of religion. It makes perfect sense. If there is a fear that too much rational or scientific thinking might lead people to atheism, it stands to reason that religions will prefer to focus on their more spiritual sides. And so we see an increased infusion of spirituality among people with no religious affiliation as well as within religions themselves.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s great that people who opt our of religion are not giving up on God and they are finding spiritual fulfillment in unorganized religion. Many non-Orthodox Jewish communities follow a similar path. It&#8217;s a good thing overall. However, there are some consequences to consider as well. Less spiritual religious people might find they have less and less in common with other believers and that could become a problem.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that we ensure that both groups have a place in our religious communities. We can&#8217;t change human nature. So while many people feel intimately tied into the spiritual cosmos and it seems to be more popular now than ever before, others do not. Those people can&#8217;t be forced into seeing or feeling spirituality. It&#8217;s just impossible to legislate feelings. These people need the other kind of religion. Let&#8217;s make sure it doesn&#8217;t become extinct.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The term Rationalist Judaism has been clanking around the Internet and Orthodox Jewish conversation for a while now. It’s not quite a movement, but there are some very strong contemporary voices behind Rationalist Judaism. Many people think the term is an oxymoron. Others think it is intellectually dishonest. Yet others think it is heresy. But without a working definition or at least a framework to understand what we are talking about, any conversation about Rationalist Judaism will result in people talking past one another and miscommunication.<span id="more-7938"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7939" alt="Thinking-Man-Rodin" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>First, to address the complaint that calling one brand of Judaism “Rationalist” is insulting or offensive to everyone else. It sure seems like the term is implying that everyone else is irrational. This is not the correct implication. Rationalist Judaism is not to the exclusion of irrationality. Instead it is to exclusion of supernaturalism. That’s not to say that mysticism is inherently irrational either. Maybe it is for some. These are just the words that are used to describe two different approaches to God and Judaism. Words are often cumbersome and imprecise. That is the case here. We don’t mean to say Rationalist Judaism is rational and everyone else is irrational.</p>
<p>In general, rationalism literally means to use reason above all else. In this view, truth can be deduced and is not subject to fallacies like appeals to authority or <em>argumentum ad populum</em>. Obviously, a religious person maintains some belief in authority and relies on some subjective baseline truths that cannot be logically argued. But we are not talking about pure rationalism. We are talking about Rationalist Judaism.</p>
<p>I believe that term Rationalist Judaism was adapted from the term Theistic Rationalism. Both groups share some common principles. The basic idea of both groups is to release theology from supernaturalism and focus on morality. To the extent that supernaturalism can be justifiably removed from religion, Rationalist Judaism holds it should be removed. That is all Rationalist Judaism really means.</p>
<p>There are several heroes and champions of this concept, none greater than Rambam. In his halachic and philosophical works, Rambam sought to eliminate superstition, mysticism, and supernaturalism from Judaism to the greatest extent possible. One overriding theme of his works is that there is nothing supernatural other than God. Giving power to charms, incantations, or even angels is akin to idol worship. He held that belief in God was logical. He held that prophecy was a natural result of perfection. He held that God rarely intervenes with nature. He held that <em>Mitzvos</em> have material benefits for the person who performs the Mitzvah. He held that astrology was bunk. He held that God conformed the Torah to the needs of mankind. He held that <em>Maaseh Breishis</em> was science. He held that <em>Maaseh </em><em>Merkava</em>h was metaphysics. There is not a single mystical idea mentioned in any of his books. It’s as if there is no such thing as mysticism in Rambam’s universe.</p>
<p>Some have tried to argue that Rambam was a mystic and obscured his true views. This has been thoroughly debunked by many great scholars and if you are of this mind, I direct you to this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906764158" target="_blank">Maimonides’ Confrontation with Mysticism</a></p>
<p>There are many other examples of great Torah authorities who used similar principles in their halachic, or philosophical, or exegetical works. R’ Samson Raphael Hirsch wrote Horeb, a book of the philosophy of <em>mitzvos</em> without a single kabbalistic reference. The entire book makes sense of Torah Judaism and it all works even if one rejects mysticism.</p>
<p>Ralbag is another. His commentary on Chumash literally reinterprets examples of supernatural events into metaphors or visions instead of real life occurrences. His worldview fit this same broad category. To the extent that supernaturalism could be excised from Torah and Judaism, he saw to it that they were.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Rationalist Judaism. It’s a tradition that has a long and powerful chain of great Torah luminaries who lived by this philosophy.</p>
<p>Another important element of Rationalist Judaism is that because God’s intervention and communication with man is so limited, the Mesorah and Holy texts of Judaism are more subject to error than one who believes that God ensures the truth of everything. In the opposing view, God’s essence permeates the writings of men like the great Talmudic scholars known as Chazal. Thus, their writings are presumed to be free of mistakes or misjudgments. Rationalist Judaism holds that the best efforts of man can still result in error. This is especially true in matters that are not Torah specific. We refer here to math, science, history, medicine, and other disciplines not directly related to Torah. However, even if Chazal were to err in issues of halacha or Torah specific interpretation, it would not matter as they have the authority to establish the laws for the Jewish people.</p>
<p>It’s true that this sort of thinking led many people to conclusions that we would reject today. Rambam himself was of the belief that God’s existence is provable. Rambam also thought Aristotelian philosophy and science were as true as God’s word in the Torah. We know that both of these are actually untrue. Does this mean that Rationalist Judaism is wrong? Of course not.</p>
<p>In fact, only someone whose paradigm is that Torah authorities are infallible would argue that by disproving Aristotle the entire worldview of Rambam is incorrect. But the paradigm of Rationalist Judaism does not allow for this sort of thinking. People do err, only God is infallible. So Rambam dealt with truth in the same way Chazal dealt with truth. That is, they were subject to the thinking and common beliefs of their time. We are also subject to the thinking and common beliefs of our time. Therefore, we are also supposed to look at Torah through the prism of modern thinking. No one actually pretends that Rambam was a Modern Orthodox Jew of 2013 America. But his worldview is one that allows, or even requires, using contemporary thinking to build one’s Jewish life. That’s what Chazal did and that is what Rambam did and that is what we are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Rambam is not making the claim that Chazal and the prophets before them lived and believed the same way he believed. Rather he is making the argument that with the same information available to Rambam they would have drawn the same conclusions as Rambam. Further, he demonstrates that so much of what they did say is compatible with his Aristotelian, Islamic influenced philosophy. However, even if they would have not reached the same conclusions, they would have used all the available information and evidence to formulate their views. That is what Rationalist Judaism attempts to do as it has always attempted to do.</p>
<p>But what’s the point of all this? Isn’t it obvious that there are supernatural forces and that Judaism believes in mysticism?</p>
<p>The answer to this very serious question is that Rambam held that these were all corruptions. In his view, true Judaism does not have any of the trappings of a supernaturalist cult. God is supernatural, a few miracles that were necessary for the birth of our nation occurred in Biblical times, but other than that, Judaism is a religion that is supposed to be hyper-focused on the practical matters of personal growth and emulating God in our lives.</p>
<p>Sure, many great people introduced mystical or supernatural elements into Judaism. Most people believe in them too. But in Rambam’s view, these are human additions and emendations. They are not integral to serving God, and may in fact harm our service of God.</p>
<p>For someone who believes in the supernatural and mystical this all sounds crazy. That’s fine. However, not everyone is predisposed to believing in things that they can’t see or prove. Those people may still be willing to suspend their disbelief or skepticism and believe in God or even in Divine Revelation. However, if they are not required to believe in mysticism and its trappings of Zoharic and Lurianic kabbalism, the ties to astrology, the use of charms and <em>segulos</em>, the existence of demons, the belief that human beings can be infallible, the idea that Chazal had access to modern science (but didn’t tell everyone about penicillin), that God still communicates with humans (but only to Orthodox Jews), and many other beliefs that require active supernaturalism and a healthy dose of non-skepticism, then why should they believe in those things? Further, if they were required to believe in these things, would it surprise us if they rejected the entire package? No, it would not. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/16/judaism-of-the-future-my-response-to-klal-perspectives-spring-2012/" target="_blank">Judaism of the Future: My Response to Klal Perspectives Spring 2012</a>)</p>
<p>Rationalist Judaism is a real thing. It’s not a fantasy. It’s not a boogeyman that seeks to demonize those who believe in supernatural Judaism. It’s an alternative for people who are more skeptical. It’s a way of serving God without being forced to believe in an entire universe that stretches beyond what is acceptable in their view. There are other side benefits to this perspective. Some of them have already been discussed on this and other blogs. One of those benefits will be the subject of a future post.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that one can practice Orthodox Judaism and love God and make a Kiddush Hashem without mysticism. It still works. Perhaps it even works better. But no matter how one practices their Judaism, it is wise to establish both views as viable options. In this way, we can ensure that the personality types that are drawn to mysticism and skepticism have a place in Orthodox Judaism.</p>
