				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another Yom Kippur is upon us. I remember talking with my 10th grade rebbe R&#8217; Kalman Weinreb outside the High School Beis Medrash on Erev Yom Kippur 5757. I was complaining about how hard the fast was for me. I suggested that it would be easier to pray and repent if I could just eat and drink a little. Not a lot, just a little. He empathized with my 15 year old sensibilities but explained to me how the complete immersion in spiritual pursuits requires complete immersion not almost complete immersion. He said it would be worth it. All good things are worth the difficult path we must take to arrive at our desired destination. R&#8217; Kalman was about to wrap up our conversation and then he looked at me with a gleam in his eye and told me that the fast gets easier every year. That was it. He walked away.<span id="more-7622"></span></p>
<p>My 15 year old self thought it was great news that the fast was going to get easier every year. Something to look forward to.<img class="alignright wp-image-7623" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Kol_nidre_in_the_machzor_of_Worms.jpg?resize=305%2C360" alt="Kol_nidre_in_the_machzor_of_Worms" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s true. The fast does get easier every year. This is my sixth Yom Kippur in an official capacity atÂ Pacific Jewish Center. The first year I led the services for Kol Nidre, Maariv, and Neilah. I also spoke 4 times. I thought that I could not possibly do any more. Four years ago I started doing Mussaf as well. Indeed, it does get easier every year.</p>
<p>My 32 year old self does not agree with my 15 year old self. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good that the fast gets easier every year. The easier the fast becomes, the harder it is to truly experience the dread and discomfort that help make the day so powerful. I am not suggesting that we make it extra hard on ourselves. We take the day as it comes. But I think something is lost as we grow older. Our idealism may fade a bit. Our imagination is a little less active. Our dreams are not quite as vivid. We don&#8217;t feel things the way we did when we were younger. That&#8217;s why it gets easier.</p>
<p>While that may make surviving Yom Kippur less of a challenge, it can make living the day more challenging. It&#8217;s a new challenge every year. The hardest part of the challenge is being aware that it is there. I&#8217;ve only recently realized that this is something I need to work on for my own Yom Kippur experience.</p>
<p>The challenge is different. But we are certainly up to the challenge. Instead of struggling to pray while we feel ragged and tired we must struggle to feel ragged and tired as we breeze through the prayers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>The goal of Yom Kippur is not to get through the day. Rather the goal is for the day of Yom Kippur to go through us.</em></strong></p>
<p>Its unique blend of spirituality should be coursing through our veins by the end of the day. After all, it&#8217;s the only thing we&#8217;ve put into ourselves for 25 hours.</p>
<p>If we succeed, and I am confident we will, we will realize the full magnitude of the gains to had on Yom Kippur no matter where we are in life.</p>

It may seem like your average AL East battle between two up and coming teams, or it could just be a symbolic contest between the two cities with Ner Israel yeshivas, Ner Israel Baltimore and Ner Israel Toronto. (No relation)</p>
<p>One bochur attended the game and I doubt he expected he would be caught on camera during the game. Surely he did not think he would be one of the stars of ESPN SportsCenter.</p>
<p>I hope he wasn&#8217;t skipping <em>seder.</em></p>
<p>Colby Rasmus hit a ball deep into foul territory just foul of left field. Nate McLouth made a spectacular attempt to catch the ball diving into the stands mere inches from our baseball loving yeshiva bochur. It wasn&#8217;t absolutely clear whether the ball was caught. The bochur attempted to clarify matters for the umpire by signaling that it was no catch. In one SportsCenter broadcast, fellow member of the tribe Steve Levy was narrating the highlightÂ and he said something about how &#8220;you got to trust the kid in the cap&#8221; (referring to the bochur&#8217;s yarmulka). The umpire would have none of it and called the batter out.</p>
<p>Clearly the bochur is a Blue Jays fan and he got caught up in the moment. He must have thought he saw the ball pop out of McLouth&#8217;s glove. I&#8217;d hate to think he got caught lying intentionally on national television.</p>
<p><em><strong>EDIT</strong>: The bochur is sticking to his story in the comments below. He says the ball popped out. However, even if the ball did pop out it was a catch before McLouth crashed over the wall. So the umpire made the correct call.</em></p>
<p>The amazing catch finished the night as the SportsCenter Top Play of the night. The catch and the bochur were shown on TV dozens of times. The bochur is famous!<span id="more-7117"></span></p>
<p>Fortunately, the bochur had no part in the beer throwing incident moments later that resulted in the ejection of the guilty fan in the same vicinity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7073" alt="Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237.jpeg?resize=200%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Rosh Yeshiva of Ner Israel, Rabbi Aharon Feldman has apologized to MK Rabbi Dov Lipman for calling him a <em>rasha.</em> In his apology, R&#8217; Feldman says that he believes the MK Lipman is <em>&#8220;l&#8217;shem shamayim&#8221;</em> and wants what is best for the Jewish people including the charedim in Israel. Because of these revelations, R&#8217; Feldman says that MK Lipman is misguided but not a <em>rasha.</em></p>
<p>R&#8217; Feldman makes the case that MK Lipman is wrong or misguided using traditional Torah sources and accepted wisdom in the yeshiva world. He very emphatically disagrees with MK Lipman but the discourse is civil.</p>
<p>Initially, I was hurt and saddened when I read R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s original remarks. While I can&#8217;t say I am thrilled with his position on this issue, there is something positive that I can say. R&#8217; Aharon Feldman showed the charedi world what it means to be an honestÂ <em>eved Hashem.</em> It takes guts to apologize. It always takes guts. But it takes ten times more guts when you are the Rosh Yeshiva of a prominent Torah institution and the subject of your apology isÂ <em>persona non grataÂ </em>in the charedi world. It could not have been easy to apologize but it was the right thing to do and for that I admire R&#8217; Feldman.</p>
<p>Further, R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s apology and argument is so different than the other recent charedi responses and rhetoric towards MK Lipman. It was respectful and somewhat positive. Again, I don&#8217;t love R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s position on this issue. But I do appreciate how stark the difference is between the way he is handling this and the way some other charedim are handling it.<span id="more-7072"></span></p>
<p>Look, it is easy to be cynical and say that R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s speech was more of the same. But I see it differently. There was some dignity in this dispute and it was not laced with disgust and revulsion. It&#8217;s sad to say it, but that is a huge improvement and I hope that those who jumped on R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s bandwagon when he called MK Lipman a <em>rasha</em> are just as quickly jumping on his bandwagon of toning down the rhetoric.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t intend to come off as one with a bias of low expectations. Not at all. I am simply comparing what R&#8217; Feldman said and did in his apology with what I have been hearing from pseudonymous writers on frum sites and their commenters. It&#8217;s a breath of fresh air and I applaud R&#8217; Feldman for doing what was right.</p>
<p>One level deeper, it gives me hope that others can see that R&#8217; Feldman is simply trying to do what is <em>emes.</em> He is not attempting character assassination for the sake of a cause. He thinks MK Lipman is wrong and told him so. But he sounds reasonable. I think the difference stems from something he alluded to in his apology. R&#8217; Feldman said that MK Lipman is a <em>shogeig</em> and a <em>shogeig</em> isn&#8217;t a <em>rasha.</em> What he means is that he is looking at his through a lens of halacha. He is not looking at it through a lens of pure politics.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are counter arguments to R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s opinion. My point here is not to say that R&#8217; Feldman made his arguments so convincingly that the discussion is closed. Rather, the way R&#8217; Feldman spoke to MK Lipman means that there is hope the discussion is still open.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Rebbeztin Chana Weinberg passed away. She was a heroic woman and an important figure in the lives of many people including my father and grandmother. Her public claim to fame may have been her pedigree as a daughter of Rabbi Ruderman and the wife of Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg. But to those who knew her or knew of her, Rebbetzin Weinberg was a person worthy of individual accolades and recognition separate from her illustrious father and husband.</p>
<p>Personally, I did not have a relationship with the Rebbetzin. I do have many fond memories of meeting her, being in her home and hearing of her greatness. As a young child I remember visiting the Rosh Yeshiva with my father and I remember him making a point of telling me that part of the visit was to see the Rebbetzin as well. We were not just visiting the Rosh Yeshiva and she happened to be there too. We were visiting her as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to me that one of the things I remember most about Rabbi Weinberg was his vibrant smile. I have the same kind of memory of the Rebbetzin. Her warmth exuded from her smile. Oftentimes, young children find elderly people scary. I only remember pleasant and loving vibrations from my early visits with the Rebbetzin.<span id="more-5070"></span></p>
<p>When I was in high school at the yeshiva, I scored a rare (for a high school boy) invitation to a Yom Tov meal at the home of the Weinbergs. Part of this was my friendship with their grandson and another part of it was my father&#8217;s relationship with the Rebbetzin. The meal was exhilarating on every level. I will always remember and cherish that experience.</p>
<p>My grandmother also had a special relationship with the Rebbetzin. They talked often. Sometimes it was personal. But other times it was professional. My grandmother is a psychologist and the Rebbetzin spent her free time offering counseling, advice and advocacy for battered and abused women in the orthodox Jewish community. From what I understand, they helped each other help others. The Rebbetzin made this one of her passions and did a tremendous amount of good for women who needed the strength they could only find in themselves with the Rebbetzin&#8217;s love and care.</p>
<p>I will always remember her eloquence and elegance. All my encounters with the Rebbetzin were inspiring.</p>
<p>I know that her passing will be hard for those who came to depend on her and their relationship with her. On a personal note, I feel a sense of loss for my father and grandmother for whom this loss is like losing a close relative and friend.</p>
<p>As Rabbi Ahron Feldman said in his eulogy, the Rebbetzin was a gadol in her own right. A true leader of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>The Rebbetzin leaves behind a legacy of love and devotion to her family, her father&#8217;s students, the entire Jewish people and the world. She led a life that was dedicated to others in a unique way. She will be missed by all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/s-NFL-CONCUSSIONS-large.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3006" title="concussion" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/s-NFL-CONCUSSIONS-large.jpg?resize=260%2C190" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The National Football League is cracking down on violent hits. Following a Sunday where several players suffered devastating hits to their heads and a season that has seen a tick up in concussions, the NFL issued several fines of $50,000 or more to players who &#8220;led with their head&#8221; into another player&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>You might think that the helmet protects a player&#8217;s head, but it is just as effective as a weapon. Launching one&#8217;s helmet into another player&#8217;s head could be an effective way of breaking up a play but it also can cause a head injury of a serious magnitude. The NFL is trying to protect its players and &#8220;head shots&#8221; will be a suspendable offense from here on out.</p>
<p>Football purists aren&#8217;t happy. They think that if players are not allowed to use their helmets as weapons on the playing field the game is diluted and weak. Real football is dangerous and pretending otherwise will ruin the game.</p>
<p>Of course this is a pathetically misinformed argument. <span id="more-3119"></span>NFL players are people too. Head trauma does not heal like a torn ACL or turf toe. It can cause health problems for the duration of the person&#8217;s life, memory loss, early onset of Alzheimers, a shorter life expectancy. See Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s article in the New Yorker from last Fall: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/10/19/091019fa_fact_gladwell" target="_blank">OFFENSIVE PLAY</a>. The dangers are real and scary. Protecting other human beings should override concerns (that are not even valid) that the game will be diluted. It&#8217;s a GAME! These are human beings! Incredible.</p>
<p>I love the NFL, but I hate the head shots. Violence makes me cringe and its no different on the Football field. I would love to see less violence in the NFL.</p>
<p>There is a legal issue as well. When someone engages in professional sports there is an &#8220;assumption of risk&#8221;. Participants waive their right to recover for damages suffered during the game, but only if the harms were caused as a result of behavior that is risky and inherent to the game. It could be argued that &#8220;head shots&#8221; are not inherent to the game of football. I know that I have played football without head shots&#8230;</p>
<p>There is a Jewish angle here too. I went to a Yeshiva High School (Ner Israel Mechina High School) where many of Â the rules of the school were determined by Torah principles. We played football most Saturday nights and we mostly played tackle football. We used no pads or protection; just our resilient teenage bodies. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries.</p>
<p>We were told that it was not &#8220;against the rules&#8221; to play tackle football but the Rosh Yeshiva (Rabbinic Leader of the school &#8211; a wise, saintly and holy man, R&#8217; Yaakov Weinberg) held that playing tackle football <em>was not permissible</em>. He explained that tackle football is a sport where part of the game requires one person to physically maul another person. In his view it was against Torah principles to participate in a game that requires one to hit and potentially harm another person.</p>
<p>We played anyway, and we really tried not hurt anyone, but the lesson stuck. How can one play a game that makes you hurt another person? Contrast that with this quote from Jerome Harrison (fined $75,000 for 2 devastating hits):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221;I don&#8217;t want to injure anybody, there&#8217;s a big difference between being hurt and being injured. You get hurt, you shake it off and come back the next series or the next game. <em>I try to hurt people</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Trying to hurt people? The game can be played beautifully without &#8220;trying to hurt people&#8221;. And perhaps more importantly, trying to hurt people is not the right way to treat fellow human beings.</p>

It has been on <a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/57583/2010/06/10/baltimore-md-orthodox-teacher-marks-75-years-in-classroom#comments" target="_blank">VIN</a>, <a href="http://matzav.com/frum-baltimore-teacher-marks-75-years-27000-school-days-in-classroom#comments" target="_blank">Matzav</a> and <a href="http://www.frumsatire.net/2010/06/13/orthodox-teacher-marks-75-years-in-the-classroom/" target="_blank">Frum Satire</a> and I am sure plenty of other blogs as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve totally been scooped on this one. But in my defense, I had the link to the video and the article last Thursday I just sat on it because I had so many other things to write about.</p>
<p>The thing is, <strong>Mr. Miller was MY math teacher</strong> at Ner Israel&#8217;s Israel Henry Beren Mechina High School. In fact Mr. Miller has also taught 2 of my 3 brothers and will likely teach the other when he gets to Calculus. Not only that, <strong>my FATHER had Mr. Miller</strong> when he was in High School. So I am pretty sure I am the first blogger to write about Mr. Miller that actually learned math from Mr. Miller.<span id="more-3074"></span></p>
<p>Just 12 years ago, I was the kid in the picture and I was the kid in the video. That makes this story, my story.</p>
<p>I am being completely honest when I say, I never had a math teacher as good as Mr. Miller. He said the funniest things and had us absolutely spellbound. As you would imagine, there are always some classroom decorum issues with teenage boys, but Mr. Miller had his classroom completely in control. The room was silent and we really learned math.</p>
<p>We always used to ask Mr. Miller questions like &#8220;why do we need to know math?&#8221; and he had the same answer every time. &#8220;Math saved me in the war.&#8221;Â Â I will never forget how Mr. Miller was able to work on maps for the allies instead of firing a Howitzer. He says, math saved his life.</p>
<p>I think the best lesson Mr. Miller taught us is that if you love what you do, you can do it forever. Mr. Miller loved teaching math and he has been teaching for 75 years. I wish Mr. Miller many more years and if he is still teaching in 7-8 years, maybe my son will be able to raise his hand when asked &#8220;how many of your grandfathers had Mr. Miller?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Since the Earthquake in Haiti many have attempted to figure out &#8220;why&#8221; the tragedy occurred.</p>
<p>There are 4 prominent versions going around the web right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/01/22/the-earth-trembles/" target="_blank">Rabbi Shafran Version 1</a>: God punished the people of Haiti because of evil speech.<br />
<a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/01/27/a-personal-note-to-cross-currents-readers/" target="_blank">Rabbi Shafran Version 2</a>: We don&#8217;t know why God punished the people of Haiti but the lesson is that we should learn is not to speak evil speech.<br />
<a href="http://www.frumsatire.net/2010/02/03/presenting-rabbi-yehuda-levin/" target="_blank">Rabbi Levin</a>: The earthquake and Tsunami and 9/11 happened because of Gays in the military.<br />
<a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/02/02/haiti-and-the-mind-of-g-d/" target="_blank">Rabbi Feldman</a>: We can&#8217;t know why the earthquake happened, but it happened for &#8220;a reason&#8221;.</p>
<p>What has been missing from this is a more rational approach<span id="more-2094"></span> predicated on the teachings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Weinberg" target="_blank">Rav Yaakov Weinberg</a> Ztz&#8221;l Rosh Yeshiva of Ner Yisrael.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with a hypothetical question.</p>
<p>Gerald is driving through the desert. He gets lost and runs out of fuel. He gets out of the car to start walking to find a gas station. He wanders for a little while. Eventually he runs out of water. He dehydrates and eventually dies in the desert.</p>
<p>Why did he die?</p>
<p>That is easy. He died because he ran out of water in a desert. The rules of nature that God created and recreates every moment dictate that when a man has no water in a desert he will dehydrate and probably die shortly thereafter. God does not bend or adjust the rules of nature to save him. Nor should God bend the rules of nature. The relationship God has with the world is that of a hidden God. God hides behind the mask of nature and does not show Himself.</p>
<p>There is a fault line the lies beneath Port Au Prince. <a href="http://www.haitixchange.com/index.php/hx/Articles/possibilty-of-earthquake-in-port-au-prince//" target="_blank">It was suggested by geologists in late 2008</a> that there could be a severe earthquake in Haiti as a result of this fault line. In January 2010 the plates along the fault line shifted. A massive earthquake ensued. Thousands of people died and many more were injured.</p>
<p>Why did they die?</p>
<p>That is also easy. They died because there was an earthquake. The rules of nature that God created and recreates at every moment dictate that when tectonic plates shift it can cause a massive earthquake. God does not bend or adjust the rules of nature to stop the earthquake. Nor should God bend the rules of nature. The relationship God has with the world is that of a hidden God. God hides behind the mask of nature and does not show Himself.</p>
<p>What about the stories in Chumash and Tanach (Old Testament) that report miracles to save individuals or groups of people?</p>
<p>Once in a while God does bend the rules of nature. This is rare and only happens in extreme circumstances. We call this a miracle. It is really a misnomer because everything is a miracle. Nature is a miracle just as much as the supernatural. But we only recognize or would recognize the supernatural miraculous. Miracles can happen, but we don&#8217;t rely on miracles nor do we expect miracles as part of the usual system and order of the universe. The universe follows the rules of nature that God created and recreates every moment.</p>
<p>What about the words of Chazal (Talmudic Rabbis) that blame natural disasters on sin?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t answer with certainty but there are a few options:</p>
<p>&#8211; For lack of scientific information they did not realize that earthquakes or other phenomena were &#8220;natural&#8221; and supposed they were supernatural events thus requiring a Divine reason.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were referring to a place and time where God did intervene on a constant basis.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were speaking polemically and urging Klal Yisrael to improve their ways and as a way of admonishing them they used exegesis to connect disaster with sin.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were misquoted or quoted out of context.</p>
<p>Then there is the Rambam. In hilchos Taanis, the Rambam states that when harm befalls the tzibur it incumbent upon klal yisrael to do teshuva and attribute the suffering the &#8220;way of the world&#8221; rather the bad things that happened were because of their evil sins.</p>
<p>This has been misquoted and misapplied in many instances. The Rambam is talking about a tragedy that happens to the tzibur. The tzibur refers to the Jewish community. So a harm among the a specific Jewish community is the time that we must attribute the harm to OUR sins.</p>
<p>What Rabbis Shafran Version 1, Feldman and Levin are doing is trying to use this Rambam in an instance of a tragedy that befell ANOTHER group of people. The earthquake was not a disaster that happened to the Jewish tzibur. It happened to another tzibur. Thus, the Rambam does not apply.</p>
<p>When would the Rambam apply? At most a tragedy that targets the tzibur. Most strictly constructed it would be when a harm is specific to the Jewish people.</p>
<p>So what are we supposed to do when tragedy strikes? When there is a Hurricane like Katrina, a Tsunami like there was in Southeast Asia or Earthquake like in Haiti?</p>
<p>We work on our compassion. We work on our empathy. We help as much as we can. We remember that life is fleeting and it can all end in a moment. We try to reenergize our relationships. We improve in our avodas Hashem. We find a way to use the tragedy to inspire us. It is personal.</p>
<p>For anyone to assume they know why this tragedy happened fails on three counts.</p>
<p>1) It did not happen to us. It happened to someone else. Do we believe in a God who punishes another party for OUR sins?</p>
<p>2) Maybe it did not happen for a reason? If it was natural then how are you going to apply some sin as the cause for nature? Do you blame sin every time a lion eats a gazelle in the African plain? How about when an innocent bystander is killed by a drunk driver? Did the bystander &#8220;deserve it&#8221;?</p>
<p>3) Even if it did happen for a reason, who are you to tell me why it happened? You think YOU know? Your puny little brain can figure out why God acts in the way He does? You know all the factors that go into &#8220;causing a natural disaster&#8221;? At best it is presumptuous at worst it is extreme arrogance bordering on apikorsus.</p>
<p>For anyone to guess why this happened fails on another count.</p>
<p>Nevuah (prophecy) ended thousands of years ago. A Navi (prophet) was like a spiritual doctor, one was able to see a Navi and ask why bad things were happening to you and the Navi could tell you why. The Navi was connected to God. That is over. It ended a long time ago. I am suspect of anyone claiming to know what God is &#8220;thinking&#8221; because they have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Trying to pretend like we know why the earthquake happened, even if we assume it happened for a reason, is wrong.</p>
<p>But at least Rabbi Shafran Version 2 and Rabbi Feldman are telling US to improve our lives in the wake of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Only one goofball has the gall to tell OTHER people how to act in response to the tragedy. Only Levin has the audacity to tell the Government of the USA that it&#8217;s &#8220;their fault&#8221; this happened. Only Levin completely abrogates himself and places the blame on something that is external to him and his group.</p>
<p>It is akin to telling a grieving mother that her son who was run over by a car was run over because the lady across the street had an affair. Ridiculous. Irresponsible. Self-righteous. Idiotic. Moronic. (Help me out hereâ¦ I am sure there are more wordsâ¦)</p>
<p>In summary, there are varying levels of what I believe to be errors in the wake of this tragedy. The least egregious is trying to figure what the precise message of the earthquake is. The most egregious is telling a 3rd party that they caused the tragedy of another.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/14/jewish-relief-efforts-for-haiti-earthquake-victims/" target="_blank">My view, as I stated just after the earthquake</a>, and the view of my Rebbeim is that the tragedy was a natural disaster. There was no malicious intent or direct message being sent to the people of Haiti or anyone else for that matter. However, it is useful for us to use the incident as inspiration to improve our lives and live each moment we are fortunate to be alive as a way of making the world a better place.</p>
<p><em>Postscript: A worthwhile read is <a href="http://rabbidmk.posterous.com/how-can-g-d-allow-natural-disasters" target="_blank">Rabbi Dov Kramer&#8217;s approach</a> which is very similar to what is written here just comes from a different direction.</em></p>

<p><strong><em><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">Do Anglo/American Jews care enough about our middle-eastern Jewish brothers and sisters?</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/criticism-of-obamas-speech-db-two.html" target="_blank">DovBear posted</a> a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/opinion/09aciman.html?_r=1" target="_blank">really great Op-Ed piece from the NY Times</a>.</p>
<p>In fact. before checking his blog I even emailed the article to him as I assumed he would find it interesting.</p>
<p>Of course, I was too late as it had already been posted!</p>
<p>What occurred subsequent to his posting of the article was even more interesting.<span id="more-761"></span></p>
<p>But first let&#8217;s go to the NY Times column. An exiled Egyptian Jew recounts the persecution his family experienced in Egypt. His issue is that President Obama took the time to mention the suffering of Palestinians and ignored the suffering of middle-eastern Jews outside of Israel. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/opinion/09aciman.html?_r=1" target="_blank">A worthwhile read</a>.</p>
<p>DovBear posted the article and it got very little attention from the commenters. As opposed to a three day running argument about Mesorah (<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/why-accepting-late-date-for-proverbs-is.html">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/more-on-mishlei-mesorah.html" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/were-amoraim-orthodox.html" target="_blank">Part 3</a>) that got hundreds and hundreds of comments.</p>
<p>On Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/DovBear/statuses/2091037902" target="_blank">DovBear posted this observation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Egyptian Jew criticizes Obama in Times oped. TBF [to be fair],Â when was theÂ last time any Ashkenazi Jew shed a tear for what happened to MidEastJews?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink/statuses/2091133403" target="_blank">responded with my experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>R&#8217; Herman Neuberger dedicated YEARS of his life to save Iranian Jews. TBF &#8211; he not only shed tears, but years and saved thousands.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Which DovBear <a href="http://twitter.com/DovBear/statuses/2091226165" target="_blank">countered with a hilarious (and sad) take</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>kol hakovod [kudos] for your yachid [individual]. Average cholent fresser [eater] from flatbush doesn&#8217;t know and doesnt care.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that DovBear is right. Where is the outrage from Ashkenazic Jews? Why does it seem like we don&#8217;t care?</p>
<p>The rest of this post is dedicated to bringing awareness to the plight of middle-eastern Jewry and an invitation for those of you may have first hand information regarding living as a Jew in Iran, Iraq, Egypt or any other middle-eastern country to contribute.</p>
<p>My first step was to contact a grandson of the aforementioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_N._Neuberger" target="_blank">Rabbi Herman Neuberger</a>.</p>
<p>Eli Neuberger relayed the following history of Iranian Jewry that is related to his grandfather&#8217;s involvement. (I have edited his comments for brevity, grammar and overall fluidity.)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The traditional Iranian Jewish schools were run by an umbrella organization called Otzar HaTorah.In the mid 70&#8217;s the Shah and his government decided to nationalise all religious schools, Jewish and Islam alike in order to curb the radical influence that was gaining traction amongst the Muslims. My Grandfather was approached by a Mr. Sasson from London, to travel to Iran to negotiate with the Government in order to minimize secular influence on religious studies.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>While in Iran, my Grandfather visited the community in Shiraz. He thought that if a group of promising Iranians would come to learn at the </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivas_Ner_Yisroel" target="_blank"><em>Ner Israel Rabbinical College</em></a><em> (NIRC), where he was the Dean. Then they could return to Iran and become the Klei Kodesh (spiritual leaders) that could lead the community.The first group arrived in 1977.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>Meanwhile in 1979 the Shah was overthrown by radical Islamists.The students in NIRC could not expect to return home. At the time, many Iranian Jews were able to leave Iran and when they arrived in Austria, Italy etc. they were granted refugee status and were able to continue on to the US.</em></p>
<p><em>The situation became far more dire in 1980 when the Iran-Iraq war started.Boys as young as 12-13 were sent to the front lines to be used as mine sweepers. Many Jews were smuggled to Turkey or Pakistan. These trips were fraught with danger, even after they were able to leave Iran. My grandfather was instrumental in assuring good treatment in Turkey and safe passage to Europe. He made many trips to the corridors of power in DC to speak to Congressman,Senators and Diplomats to be able to insure this continuing clandestine exodus.</em></p>
<p><em>Many of the boys that made the harrowing trip came to study Torah in NIRC.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>All this good work was done behind the scenes and with very little fanfare.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>According to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">n</span>ever accurate Wikipedia, Rabbi Neuberger was instrumental in saving 60,000 Iranian Jews.</p>
<p>I contacted another friend of mine, Natan Davoodi. His family is Iranian (in LA they are called Persian).</p>
<p>He told me that as far as he knows the non-Jews only tolerate the Jews of they can exploited for the benefit of the non-Jew. That doesn&#8217;t sound very good.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I did not mention Roger Cohen. A NY Times columnist, Cohen has a thing for the Iranians. He thinks all is honky-dory in Iran. He writes about it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/opinion/23cohen.html?scp=7&amp;sq=roger%20cohen&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/opinion/02cohen.html?scp=10&amp;sq=roger%20cohen&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">here</a>. Absolute disgrace.</p>
<p>I would like to hear from you if you know of any injsutice to Jewish people in middle-eastern countries (outside of Israel). Just telling those stories will get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>We are all brothers and sisters and there is no excuse for ignoring their plight.</p>
