				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gavel31.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7106" alt="gavel31" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gavel31-300x247.jpg" width="300" height="247" /></a>I am not permitted to disclose particular details, but I was privy to the court transcript of the end of the trial and court decision in the custody battle from <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/05/20/another-ex-hasid-loses-custody-of-her-children/" target="_blank">yesterday&#8217;s post.</a> My general thoughts have not changed. In general, I think that many women are scared that if they leave the ultra-orthodox community they will be forced to forgo custody of their children. This is a legitimate fear. That was my point yesterday.</p>
<p>Today, I will address this case and I will attempt to be brief.</p>
<p>The case is complex and there is no simple solution. Both of the parents are flawed human beings, just like the rest of us. Both parents have some merit to their case. The judge seemed to skew toward the father whenever it was a judgment call and away from the mother when it was a judgment call. The primary issue in the case, as always, is what is the best interest of the child.</p>
<p>One aspect of that was where the children would have less &#8220;confusion&#8221;. With very little support and with a dismissive wave of the hand to the mother&#8217;s expert, the judge ruled that having the children live a new secular life with their mother would be more harmful than continuing the same life with their father.</p>
<p>I think this was the weakest part of the case.<span id="more-7105"></span></p>
<p>The children will still be seeing their mother on a fairly regular basis. Although she is required to adhere to the rules of the children&#8217;s&#8217; school, they will know she is not chasidic like their father is. So it&#8217;s still confusing. I don&#8217;t see how this solves anything.</p>
<p>In other words, the court established as a fact that there would be confusion is she were awarded custody &#8211; this was speculative and rebuttal evidence was not really considered, then the court established that to minimize confusion the father should be awarded custody &#8211; this doesn&#8217;t seem to solve the problem. This was the extent to which religious values and practices were applied in the case. It was purely with regard to &#8220;confusion&#8221;.</p>
<p>In terms of this case, I think the evidence to support custody on either side was weak. Neither side made a great case. The &#8220;confusion&#8221; section of the decision was particularly speculative (which is ironic considering how the judge dismissed some evidence in favor of the mother because it was too speculative). In the trial transcript the judge clearly said that the mother has the right to choose to leave orthodox Judaism, however she cannot make that choice for her children. I found that troubling. I wonder how old or how young a child must be for a parent to have the right to take their child out of orthodox Judaism? Maybe never?</p>
<p>In terms of the general issues this case raises, I think there are some legitimate concerns. First, like I said above, I think that losing child custody is a fear that many women have when they consider leaving orthodox Judaism. I am not sure this is the best tactic for keeping people in the fold nor do I think it is a positive message from the Frum community. But I think this case opens the door to fighting this presumption. The court relied heavily on the &#8220;confusion&#8221; for the children if their mother was no longer ultra-orthodox. This can be rebutted. It might take some time, it might take some better experts, but by no means is this a <em>fait accompli.Â </em>Further, the court seemed to have been much more amenable to joint custody solutions if the mother would have committed to even the slightest observance. There is room in the most liberal sects of modern orthodoxy for very relaxed observance. It seems that this would have been enough to allay fears of confusion. This just goes to show how little sense the &#8220;confusion&#8221; issue makes.</p>
<p>In sum, the case was decided on several issues. It was a harsh decision that I don&#8217;t think solves the issues it purports to solve. It was not a purely religious decision. It seems that this case need not be a case that will impact future cases of women in similar situations if the chips fall just a little bit differently.</p>
<p>I empathize with the mother in this case, but I do not feel that the sole issue in the case was religious observance. It may have played to prominent a role, but I have a feeling she may have lost custody even if &#8220;confusion&#8221; was not at issue here. In the end, it is extremely painful to read, let alone experience, a judge deciding the fate of a family. I can only imagine what kind of pain the entire family is experiencing. In particular, the mother, who lost custody must be completely beside herself. I wish her much strength in putting the pieces back together and finding happiness and success in the next phase of her life.</p>

<p>It seems the &#8220;impossible&#8221; has happened again. Kelly Myzner lost custody of her children last week.</p>
<p>I have not seen the court documents. Although I have read a few articles about the case and I am well aware that every situation has at least two sides to the story.</p>
<p>If you want to see one version of the facts go to Unpious and read <a href="http://www.unpious.com/2013/05/ex-hasidic-mother-loses-custody-of-children/">Ex-Hasidic Mother Loses Custody of Children</a>Â by Shulem Deen. Whether the facts are the way the ex-hasid community presents them or not, the phenomena is real.<span id="more-7101"></span></p>
<p>It is true thatÂ <em>baalei teshuvaÂ </em>in the chasidic community will be set up with less than stellar matches. It is true that sometimes those less than stellar young men or women have personality defects. It is true that personality defects worsen in one&#8217;s 20&#8242;s and are further exacerbated by marriage and parenthood. It is true that people who are in bad marriages will see the worst of their society and will look outside their community. It is true that people in a marriage can get fed up with one another and find themselves in completely different religious spheres. Sometimes the couple will seek divorce.</p>
<p>What happens next is the real point here.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the primary caregiver &#8211; usually the mother, is awarded primary custody. However, sometimes the mother is denied custody for a potpourri of reasons. One reason that has been used in court proceedings is that the children should stay in the same religious environment. Usually this means that the parent who is deviating will lose custody. When it is the mother, the courts will sometimes deny the mother custody.</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons for this: First, the assumption could be that deviating from the agreed upon religious beliefs in the marriage is like a breach of contract. She breached, so he wins. Second, deviating could be viewed as a a symptom of imbalance. Third, the children have a status quo of religious practice and taking that away from them and them away from it is unfair collateral damage. Fourth, the court systems are rigged and they are bought and paid for by the ultra-orthodox community. Fifth, the ultra-orthodox community projects a unified front and unwavering support for their own so the chances that the children will be cared for increases within the ultra-orthodox community. Sixth, the ultra-orthodox community pays for a super-lawyer while the deviating party gets by with a legal aid lawyer and the super-lawyer wins.</p>
<p>I am not saying that all these reasons are true, fair, or valid. However, they are all part of the equation. So I don&#8217;t think that the sole reason anyone loses custody is because they deviated from the religious beliefs.Â But religion is definitely used as a weapon in these proceedings.</p>
<p>My feeling is that the children of these families are going to need their mothers more than most children. They will have a hard time throughout their lives due to the disparate religious beliefs of their parents and families. As long as the mother is a good mother, the mother should be taking care of the children. A good mother has nothing to do with religion. Good mothers are everywhere, not just in the ultra-orthodox community.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be a very strong reason to deny the mother custody. I don&#8217;t think that being an atheist is a valid reason. More importantly, I don&#8217;t love the idea of the secular court system weighing the religious beliefs of the parents to determine custody. It&#8217;s probably not a good idea and it might not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.</p>
<p>Most importantly, using children as pawns in any custody battle is deplorable. But when children are used to keep people in the fold we cross the line from deplorable to cult-like. The community does not own the children. That is what happens in a cult. Parents are responsible to raise their children as they deem fit. If the parents have differing opinions on those issues, it is their issue and they must resolve it. But using the brute force of a strong insular community to win the day is just not acceptable.</p>
<p><em>If I see the court documents I will be able to confirm the particulars of this case. In the meantime these are my general thoughts.</em></p>
