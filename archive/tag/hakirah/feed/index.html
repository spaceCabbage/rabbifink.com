				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ralbag or Gershonides is famously rationalist and shuns all mystical interpretations in his commentary on the Chumash. Sometimes it seems impossible to avoid a mystical interpretation. One such section in the Chumash is the wrestling match between Jacob and the <em>sar</em> (minister) of Esau. They wrestle all night, Jacob is victorious, the <em>sar</em> says he needs to be on his way, Jacob asks for a blessing, he is blessed with the name Israel, and due to Jacob&#8217;s leg injury we do not eat the sciatic nerve.<span id="more-7853"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/breenbergh_bartholomeus-jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7854" alt="breenbergh_bartholomeus-jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/breenbergh_bartholomeus-jacob_wrestling_with_the_angel.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Traditionally, the <em>sar</em> is interpreted as a heavenly angel who represents the spiritual side of Esau. I&#8217;ve always had a problem with this, my limited knowledge of angels notwithstanding, because I don&#8217;t understand why Esau has an angel who corresponds to his flesh and blood self. Do we all have corresponding angels? If not, why is Esau special? But I digress. Ralbag will have none of it. He does not subscribe to the view that angels exist. So what happened?</p>
<p>A couple of years ago <a href="Hakirah.org" target="_blank">Hakirah</a> published an excellent article on Ralbag by Yitzhak Grossman. The article is a broad overview of Ralbag and provides a fairly thorough depiction of Ralbag. One section of the article is about how Ralbag would allegorize passages that could not be understood simply in his worldview. The primary example is the story of Jacob wrestling.</p>
<p>In short, he says the whole thing was a prophetic vision, a dream. There was no physical battle. There is no actual heavenly minister of Esau. Rather, Jacob was concerned about his upcoming battle and we know that what one thinks about will have an influence on their dreams. So Jacob dreamed the whole thing.</p>
<p>But how did he injure his leg in a dream? There is no reason to think Jacob did not actually injure his leg because the Torah prohibits us from eating the sciatic nerve based on the incident. Jacob&#8217;s leg must have been injured. But how? Ralbag gives two answers.</p>
<p>1. Sometimes a dream can feel real. It can activate our bodies in a way that causes a physical action despite the fact that what we are seeing or experiencing is not real. He mentions nocturnal emissions as an example. The person&#8217;s body reacts to the thoughts in the person&#8217;s dream. Sometimes we dream that we are jumping or running and it will cause our leg to suddenly move. We&#8217;ve all experienced this at some point.</p>
<p>Jacob was having an extremely visceral dream. When he saw his leg injury in his dream it caused him to move his leg in a way that caused him to severely injure himself. When we woke up, he was limping.</p>
<p>2. Sometimes we dream about the things that are happening to us during our sleep. If you are cold, you might dream about being in a cold place. If a man is aroused, he might dream he is with a woman. Our physical condition during our sleep can affect our dreams.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s possible that Jacob dreamt about his leg becoming dislocated in a wrestling match with Esau&#8217;s heavenly angel because while he was moving his family and transporting his possessions across the river he actually hurt his leg. That night he dreamed about his aching leg and spiritual meaning became attached to it.</p>
<p>Pretty creative and pretty interesting, if you ask me.</p>
<p>This path of Torah study has been mostly neglected in our current system of Torah learning. We study the other commentaries. The ones who believed in angels and magic are much more popular. That&#8217;s just the way it is. Perhaps we could say this is some sort of &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; Torah and our Mesorah has evolved to focus more on the mystical side of things.</p>
<p>But I wonder how different Orthodox Judaism would look and feel if this Maimonidean version of Judaism had won the day. Would we be better off? Would we be worse off? Would it have any impact at all?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think that the Judaism of the Maimonidean persuasion flourished in a time and place that was not that different than our American Orthodox Judaism. Jews were not subject to violence and pogroms. Jews were protected under the law and by and large were able to live productive lives within the society of the Arab world. Mysticism was certainly found there as well, but mysticism really flourished in the European countries where Jews were living in constant fear for their lives.</p>
<p>Might our social environment be more similar to the Golden Age of Spanish Jewry? Might our world be more conducive to Maimonidean philosophy? I think it&#8217;s very possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/jonah_logo_main_e_large.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6583 alignleft" title="jonah_logo_main_e_large" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/jonah_logo_main_e_large.jpg?resize=250%2C274" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Conversion therapy is not counseling for people who convert to Judaism. Rather, conversion therapy is an controversial program that is designed to help gay people become un-gay. It is most popular among religious groups who feel that being gay is prohibited by the Bible and they desperately want to rid themselves of their homosexuality.</p>
<p>The problem is that these techniques are shunned by all mainstream mental health groups.</p>
<p>Recently a lawsuit was filed against JONAH for engaging in these unregulated therapy sessions and causing more harm than good. The details are a bit sordid and not really necessary to understand what is happening. The suit alleges that JONAH is using controversial therapy methods to change people&#8217;s orientation and are causing serious pain to many of the people whom they are trying to help.</p>
<p>California courts are grappling with this as well.<span id="more-6580"></span> On one hand, a judge has ruled that the therapy should not be used and issued an injunction against its implementation. On the other hand, a federal judge ruled that therapy is mostly &#8220;speech&#8221; and the government cannot regulate &#8220;speech&#8221; without contravening the First Amendment. Meanwhile, activists believe that the therapy is effective and feel that it is unfairly maligned. We will see how this plays out over the next year or so.</p>
<p>As it relates to orthodox Jews, Conversion Therapy has become a passionate point of debate recently as well.</p>
<p>In Hakirah, Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetsky was quoted as a proponent of JONAH, basically endorsing the therapy that they do. This was met with a serious rebuttal in the subsequent (current) issue of Hakirah. The RCA endorsed JONAH for a while, but citing current scientific evidence, the RCA no longer endorses JONAH.</p>
<p>Then there is the lawsuit mentioned above. The suit is being brought to put a stop to JONAH&#8217;s practices. Meanwhile, JONAH is operating with rabbinic endorsements. Losing the suit could present a problem for rabbis wishing to endorse JONAH.</p>
<p>In the current issue of Dialogue* (I asterisk it because it is more like a monologue than a dialogue) Rabbi Ahron Feldman writes a passionate article about homosexuality and the frum community. In some places it is mildly progressive, in other places it is not and I believe it to be severely flawed. Perhaps I will formulate a respectful response to the entire article some day. For now, Rabbi Feldman endorses JONAH wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>This sets up a classic point of divergence between the charedi and modern orthodox community. The charedi community still supports JONAH and the working assumption is that the current whims of science are inconclusive or flat out wrong. Whereas the modern orthodox community takes the science that has emerged very seriously and changed their recommendation of conversion therapy based upon that scientific evidence.</p>
<p>I honestly think that it is as simple as that. As for me, unless there is a doctrine of faith that is contravened by science (and I know of none) I see no reason to reject science simply in favor of traditional thinking.</p>
<p>The question becomes, what would influence the charedi rabbis to change their stance? Anything? Is that right or wrong?</p>
<p>While frum men who are only attracted to men (and frum women to women) are left to wonder if they have a place in orthodox Judaism at all. And if they do, where and how. And while it may be interesting to talk about how to help orthodox men who don&#8217;t want to be attracted to men, the more important issue remains how important it is that we create safe places for all people to practice and observe their religion, even if they are gay and orthodox Jews.</p>

This was an unchallenged assertion for most of my life. Jews simply did not enter the Temple Mount. I remember being somewhat outraged that a Jewish leader like Ariel Sharon would publicly flout Jewish law and ascend the Temple Mount.</p>
<p>I do remember hearing about a fringe group, led by a rabbi I knew from Monsey as a friend and advisor of my father, Rabbi Moshe Tendler ascending the Temple Mount. That was my first exposure to any Torah authority permitting Jews to go up there.</p>
<p>In recent years, more and more orthodox Jews have been going to the Temple Mount with rabbinic approval or rabbinic chaperones to ensure that they do not step in a place that they are not allowed to go under Jewish law. People are noticing.<span id="more-6395"></span></p>
<p>The LA Times is reporting that there is some political tension that is being caused by these increased visits to the Temple Mount. Some Muslims, and apparently some members of the media, view this is a provocation designed to instigate attacks against Jews thus justifying counter-attacks by Israel. I bet there are some people who go up there as activists and hope to start up with Muslims. There are idiots everywhere. But I think it is ludicrous to propose that the increase in Temple Mount visits has anything to do with Muslims. For thousands of years, Jews have yearned to ascend the Temple Mount once again. If we have the opportunity and the halachic framework to do so, Jews will want to go. It has been a collective dream of ours to pray on the Temple Mount for two thousand years. That is why people want to go to pray on the Temple Mount.  Who else is up there is completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>I find the suggestion that Jews are going up the Temple Mount as a provocation a serious accusation. It is an accusation that lack substance because there is a much more reasonable explanation.</p>
<p>To read an excellent article about Jewish law regarding ascending the Temple Mount, read this article by friend Henoch Messner: <a href="http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%2010%20Messner.pdf" target="_blank">Hakirah</a></p>

That article discussed the various positions and authorities in Jewish Law regarding ascending the Temple Mount. Their next project was an article on contraception in orthodox Judaism. This article has not yet been published. It is being made available on this blog to benefit the public.</em></p>
<p>A little while back (I can&#8217;t remember when) I mentioned that would be writing a blog post about this subject. I had intended to do a little summary of this article and add my own two cents. Now you get the full article and maybe only 1 cent from me.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my one cent. Contraception is a huge issue in the orthodox Jewish community. In general, its use is managed by the rabbis. Couples are discouraged from using birth control in general.</p>
<p><span id="more-5759"></span></p>
<p>In some more liberal communities within the yeshivish community, newly married couples are being granted a few months of contraception use. This is because there has been a spate of quick divorces in the community so they are encouraged to use birth control just to make sure they aren&#8217;t stuck with a baby on the way and a crumbling marriage.</p>
<p>Once the couple is comfortably married, they are expected to have a large family. Birth control is usually permitted for at least a year after a baby is born. That&#8217;s it. More than that requires asking the rabbi. The rabbis usually give a few months. Then the couple asks again and they get a few weeks. They ask again, the rabbi tries to convince them it is time to have another baby. At this point the couple has four options. 1) Listen to the rabbi. 2) Ignore the rabbi and risk lose respect for rabbinic guidance. 3) Explain to the rabbi why it is impossible to have another baby because of financial pressures (he will say Hashem will help), or because there is too much stress from motherhood (he will say to get domestic help), or because of the mother&#8217;s emotional or physical health (that might do the trick) and hopefully the rabbi will grant a longer reprieve. 4) Lie about the things mentioned in 3.</p>
<p>I hear things. People tell me things. I get emails. I get phone calls. It seems the most popular option these days are #1 and #4. Some people just listen. They have large families and even if some don&#8217;t really want large families, they do it and just chalk it up to the price of being a <em>Frum Yid</em>. But many others end up lying or stretching the truth just so the rabbi will let them use birth control.</p>
<p>Sometimes the rabbis even want to talk to the wives and they try to show them that having children is so important and some have even said that it is more important than their relationships with their husbands.</p>
<p>I have heard these things from men and women, first hand. Some are disappointed, most feel discouraged, and all are upset.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a problem here.</p>
<p>To what extent should couples be able to make their own decision about contraception? To what extent should rabbis be pulling the strings here? What do the sources say about birth control? Is it really a rabbi&#8217;s decision? Is there another way?</p>
<p>Enter this excellent article by Rabbis Mayer and Messner.</p>
<p>I love this article. It goes through the sources very thoroughly and ultimately favors personal decision making and autonomy over blind adherence to authority. In a macro sense, <em>this is how I feel orthodox Judaism works best</em>. Educate yourself on a subject, and make an informed decision that falls within the parameters of halacha on your own. That is the basic premise of the article.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t ruin the article by snatching the punchline. Read the article for yourself. It is worth your time and should be understandable to most people with a basic Torah education.</p>
<p>As a an additional benefit, the writers of the article will be checking in to answer questions and respond to your comments. So please, by all means, maximize this opportunity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/House-Divided.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5363" title="House Divided" alt="" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/House-Divided.jpg?resize=207%2C210" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>For the zillionth time since the start of the 19th century, there is a Metzitza b&#8217;Peh controversy. I have nothing particularly new to add to the foray but I do have an insight about the way the lines are drawn in this conflict that may help others understand exactly what is really going on. Every source in this post is found in previous writings. This post is a very broad summary with an important implication.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start at the beginning. The Mishna in Mesechta Shabbos says that we perform a circumcision on Shabbos and also metzitza (suction on the wound to draw out the blood) is performed. Apparently the metzitza was done by placing the mouth on the wound and sucking  The Gemara and the Rambam explain that metzitza is done to promote healing and prevent unnecessary harm from befalling the infant. This is clearly a medical concern. As Dr. Shlomo Sprecher shows in his masterful article on the subject, this was the common view of medicine at the time of the Talmud and through the era of Maimonides. Similar medical views are found in the premier medical treatise of the era, Galen&#8217;s Corpus.<span id="more-5347"></span></p>
<p>In the 19th century, the Jewish community became aware that the medical benefits of metzitza were likely outweighed by the potential harms of metzitza b&#8221;peh. Some rabbis recommended discontinuing the practice. Notably, the Chasam Sofer and R&#8217; Hirsch tried to urge their communities to use a glass tube to create the suction instead of direct contact with the mouth.</p>
<p>Others pushed back. For example, the Maharam Schick elevated metzitzah b&#8217;peh to halacha l&#8217;Moshe m&#8217;Sinai status. This was to make it unimpeachable. It was also the first mention of this halacha l&#8217;Moshe m&#8217;Sinai in recorded history (I believe). The issue was far from settled, even in the 19th century.</p>
<p>The controversy arose again when several babies were diagnosed with a virus and it was presumed that the virus was contracted during metzitza b&#8217;peh. Since that time, many articles have battled over whether the babies were really infected because of metzitza b&#8217;peh or not. Other articles analyze whether or not the baby is actually placed into danger via metzitza b&#8217;peh or not. I am not qualified to have an opinion on this matter. To me, it is irrelevant. Everything we know about sickness and germs tells us that this is a bad idea from a medical standpoint. No one living in the West in 2012 could say with a straight face that placing one&#8217;s mouth over a fresh wound is a great idea. We will ignore this point of contention. It is not relevant for the purposes of this post.</p>
<p>Most recently, Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetsky was quoted in the The Jewish Week regarding this issue. According to them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In a phone conversation with The Jewish Week, Rabbi Kamenetsky noted that in his community “as far as I know, they do metzitzah with a tube [a sterile pipette that prevents the mouth from directly touching the wound].”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When asked about rabbis who believe that using a tube is not valid under Jewish law, Rabbi Kamenetsky replied, “Nobody holds like that.” Told of those who make this claim, the apparently incredulous rabbi said only, “I don’t think there’s a response to them.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The rabbi also expressed disbelief about those who would insist on the practice despite its links to the transmission of disease to infants.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Chas v’shalom [God forbid], if [children are] getting sick [from oral suction], [you] wouldn’t do it,” under Jewish law, he said.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Rabbi Kamenetsky also stated that because it is permissible to do the suctioning with a tube, which poses “no risk at all” to the infant, this should be the practice.</em></p>
<p>The reaction to this statement among the orthodox community was mostly positive. A survey of comments from the various Jewnews sites seems to indicate a respectful approach to this characterization of R&#8217; Shmuel&#8217;s opinion.</p>
<p>But then R&#8217; Shmuel &#8220;clarified&#8221; his remarks. And by clarified, we mean that he softened his stance significantly. The Jewsnews<strong>™</strong> sites reported that R&#8217; Shmuel certainly does not advocate banning metzitza b&#8217;peh. Rather, if a danger is established, a tube should be used. Further, no one holds that a tube is not &#8220;good enough&#8221; for metzitza b&#8217;peh.</p>
<p>Anger is being directed at the Jewish Week for misconstruing R&#8217; Shmuel&#8217;s statement. This is really silly because the two statements are entirely reconcilable. There is no reason to bash the Jewish Week for its take on R&#8217; Shmuel&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>But what is really going on here? Why do some people insist that metzitza b&#8217;peh is such an integral part of circumcision? Especially when it is clear that great rabbis have permitted the use of tube and in light of the fact that the entire point of metzitza is to promote healing as per ancient medicine? Why is this considered such a holy practice?</p>
<p>There are two answers (I think). One is reactionary, the other is ideological.</p>
<p>The reactionary approach views circumcision as a holy rite that has been mocked and banned more than several times throughout our history. The feeling is that even one step backward (really forward) from this ancient tradition places the entire thing in jeopardy. If circumcision is being attacked in any way, shape, or form, we must attack back. We fight for circumcision. Even when there is no real reason to fight.</p>
<p>I think this is a popular approach. Clearly it is based on a huge fallacy. But it is nonetheless understandable. Yet I think the real reason is the second reason.</p>
<p>The ideological approach is based on a mystical source. A 17th century kabbalist wrote that there is a kabbalistic reason for metzitza b&#8217;peh. The Talmud, which speaks of medical reasons, is trumped by the mystical source which speaks of kabbalistic reasons. The idea is that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8230;man possesses a foreskin because of Adam’s sin in the Garden of Eden.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The same parts of the body which caused this distortion must restore the body to its natural perfection. Adam’s hands took the forbidden fruit and his mouth ate it, so the hands of the mohel remove the foreskin and the blood is removed with the mouth. (Source: Rabbi Korobkin&#8217;s excellent article.)</em></p>
<p>I think this source is the real reason behind the entire kerkuffle. Like few other areas of Jewish law and practice, metzitza b&#8217;peh places the mystical and rationalist points of view at loggerheads.</p>
<p>According to the rationalist, the reason for metzitza b&#8217;peh is medical. There was no emphasis on using the mouth and our great rabbis are not to be blamed for their faulty science. There is no sacred meaning behind metzitza b&#8217;peh and therefore it can be pushed aside for a more modern solution that is equally acceptable in halacha. According to the mystic, the reason for metzitza b&#8217;peh is kabbalistic. Some <em>tikkun</em> is taking place when the mohel places his mouth on the circumcision wound and therefore it must be upheld at (almost) all costs. Perhaps our great rabbis of the Talmud were not speaking of some physical medicine when they said that metzitza b&#8217;peh was necessary for medical reasons, rather it is a spiritual cure for an esoteric flaw in humanity.</p>
<p>This is where we stand today. Mystics and Rationalists living under one roof. A house divided. Who will prevail? Is strength in numbers? Or is strength in reason? We will likely find out the answer to that question soon enough. In the meantime, I think it is prudent to see the sides of this battle for what they are, mysticism vs. rationalism. Again. I think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/6-Suffragist-Picketing4.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4349" title="6 Suffragist Picketing(4)" alt="" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/6-Suffragist-Picketing4.jpg?resize=300%2C288" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I am a big fan of Hakirah, a really nicely done Torah journal. I was turned onto the publication by a friend of mine who was published in the journal and am now a subscriber.</p>
<p>The most recent Hakirah attempted to begin to tackle the issue of women in the rabbinate. It began with a short article from <strong>Rabbi Herschel Schachter</strong> who did not do the subject justice but concluded, based on the laws of <em>tznius</em>, that a position such as Rabbi is not a preferable place for men or women due to its very public nature. However in choosing who should perform the public duties of a Rabbi, it is better to have men in a position of non-tznius than women.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s article is interesting but too short. It leaves way too much wiggle room and seems to be referring mostly to women pulpit rabbis.</p>
<p>The next article does a much more comprehensive job of dealing with the issue. Its authors are <strong>Rabbi Michael Broyde</strong> and <strong>Rabbi Shlomo Brody</strong>.</p>
<p>When I first broached this topic on this blog I did so in the context of social change. (PLEASE READ: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/23/patience-is-a-virtue-and-an-important-ingredient-for-change/">Patience Is A Virtue and An Important Ingredient For Change</a>) My premise is that all social change happens slowly. Change that is too quick or premature can backfire. I predicted that women would continue to see more prominent roles in areas of religious leadership over time.</p>
<p>My good friend <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a> vehemently disagreed with this wait and see approach. <span id="more-4344"></span>In his mind an injustice cannot be tolerated at all. Since he feels that the current situation for women in orthodox Judaism is an injustice, patience is a curse, not a cure. Now DovBear is entitled to shriek from the rooftops but that doesn&#8217;t mean anything will change. Personally, I am concerned with real change not just proclamations.</p>
<p>I view the issue primarily as a social one, not a <em>halachic</em> one. The reason for this is that I believe that the law will adapt to the social environment. However this is only possible if there is a halachic mechanism to give women a more prominent role in religious leadership. It has been demonsrated by Rabbis Broyde and Brody that it can. Certainly it can also be prohibited by law if one makes certain halachic decisions. But it would be equally halachically acceptable to adapt what is currently halachically acceptable. One major factor the Rabbis cite, is the public needs, desires and perception.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend reading the full article. I have uploaded an annotated version of the article with specific key points underlined. Read that here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Vol-11-Broyde.pdf" target="_blank">Hakirah Vol 11</a>.</p>
<p>My summary of the women in religious leadership roles in orthodox Judaism is as follows:</p>
<p>Many women in the Bible are heroes. They frequently possess keener insight than their male counterparts. Sometimes they are stronger than the men. Other times they play a secondary role, but star anyway. <em>Midrashim</em> also speak highly of women. In the law, women are afforded much more liberty and equality than in other ancient legal systems. In ancient times, the Torah was a progressive woman&#8217;s best hope. There is no indication in the Torah that women could not and should not be able to achieve the same level of scholarship or religious leadership as men. The one example where women are severely limited is in becoming king or by extension any other position of <em>serara.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Talmud</em> has several statements that seem to disparage women. The most classic example is the oft repeated prohibition against teaching women Torah. The Talmud explains this statement by one <em>Tanna</em> in a <em>Mishna</em> with the statement &#8220;<em>Nashim daatam kalos</em>&#8220;. Which literally translated means that women are weak-minded and since that is the case, it is futile to teach them Torah. The Rambam codifies this into halacha.</p>
<p>Throughout the world, for the bulk of the last 2000 years since the beginning of the Mishnaic period the sentiment that women are inferior has been accepted as fact. It is plain as day to see this fact when considering the great lengths women had to go in order to get equal rights in the greatest democracy in the world. Even as few as 103 years ago, the Supreme Court has no problem publishing an opinion based on the fact that women were primarily vehicles of reproductivity and must be protected from working too many hours lest we harm their reproductive prowess. As per the summary on Oyez.org &#8220;Brewer&#8217;s opinion conveyed the accepted wisdom of the day: that women were unequal and inferior to men.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.oyez.org/cases/1901-1939/1907/1907_107" target="_blank">Muller v. Oregon</a>).</p>
<p>2000 years ago it was a given. Women are inferior. It took thousands of years for the secular world to escape that mentality.</p>
<p>I am aware of the mental gymnastics and apologetics to excuse or &#8220;explain&#8221; what the Talmud meant. To me, they are useless. In a world where women have every opportunity that men have, women are choosing to accomplish things their grandmothers could never have dreamed. Orthodox Jewish women expect and should expect to have similar opportunities within their religion. AH! But it wasn&#8217;t ever this way! We ALWAYS did it the old way! How can we break from Tradition? Worse, are we violating halacha?!</p>
<p>In my opinion, there is no shame in admitting the mistakes of our past. The rabbis in the Talmud were entirely justified in using the feelings and temperament of their era in applying them to Torah and Law. I don&#8217;t believe that we are bound to maintain their opinions of women or anyone. Certainly they were wise and certainly they did the best they could to serve Hashem and teach us for posterity how to do the same. But they were people and people are subject to the notions and vicissitudes of their time.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>[I have been accused of being a &#8220;Conservative Rabbi&#8221; and a &#8220;fraud&#8221; for holding this position. I don&#8217;t believe this is a fair criticism. As per the Rambam, the variety of opinions on matters such as these are not part of the Oral Law passed down from Sinai to Moses and beyond. Thus, acknowledging that the rabbis of the Mishna and Talmud were able to formulate their own opinions and were not merely transmitting previously known information that was received at Sinai is not any more the attitude of a &#8220;Conservative Rabbinics&#8221; than it is the attitude of the Rambam.] </em></span></p>
<p>There is no shame in recognizing that the social environment and scientific data have changed our opinion of what women are capable of accomplishing. It would be foolish to assume that women are able to function at the highest levels of academia, science, politics, or any non-physical activity but would be unable to achieve great accomplishments in Torah and religious leadership. Indeed, they can.</p>
<p>The question is &#8220;may they?&#8221;.</p>
<p>To this question Rabbis Broyde and Brody answer a resounding&#8230; &#8220;Possibly&#8221;. But a key to their analysis is public acceptance of change in attitude towards women&#8217;s ever increasing role in orthodox Jewish religious life.</p>
<p>A century ago women had far fewer opportunities than they do today. As I wrote previously, the fact that women can study Torah in schools and places of higher learning and maintain positions of authority in Torah institutions is certainly a great innovation of the last 100 years. It is not to be taken lightly or for granted. The wisdom of our rabbis in allowing this change must be noted. The point is that women are on a track and the track is leading to a place of even greater opportunity for women. The only remaining question is how long it will take to get there.</p>
<p>When the public demands it, it will happen. When it becomes necessary it will happen. When the only obvious choice is to take that train to the next station, it will happen.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am not condoning the recent ordination of orthodox Jewish women as Rabbis (or Rabbas, or whatever). Nor am I proposing that within a few decades women will be taking positions as pulpit rabbis and Roshei Yeshiva. I am saying that there will be more opportunities for scholarship at least on par with the opportunities men have to study Torah vigorously. Correspondingly, there will be a need for women leaders and educators who have demonstrated mastery over their studies. Today, women are chosen as teachers and educators and yet, generally, compared with a mediocre yeshiva student they are ignoramuses. Creating greater opportunities for higher learning will change that. Women who are so inclined will able to receive recognition for scholarship and Torah knowledge. Our children will benefit from better school teachers. Our synagogues will benefit from better Torah classes given by women.</p>
<p>All this being said, it remains a choice for each woman or family to decide. Every family is different and some women may be happy or happier with more traditional roles. But those roles will be borne out of a choice as opposed to lack of choice. It will help women who make either choice, or if they can somehow choose both better Jews and better mother, each in their own way.</p>
<p>What should we do in the meantime? Rabbis Broyde and Brody said it best:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Women should sit and study for increasingly long periods of time, write serious scholarship in Torah, develop as inspiring spiritual personas, and lead Torah institutions, in function if not in form. In short, they should build the Orthodox community brick by brick, and see what happens over time.</em></p>
<p>So to summarize my summary:</p>
<p><em>Women used to be thought of as inferior. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with admitting that. But now we know they aren&#8217;t. They may have different roles. That should not preclude them from scholarship and recognition as Torah scholars and leaders. Eventually it won&#8217;t. Meanwhile, become scholars as best you can. This is all reconcilable with halacha. Of course it is.</em></p>
