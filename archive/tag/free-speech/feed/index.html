Sometimes the jury doesn&#8217;t care that the defendant committed the crime. Sometimes the jury would rather put a guilty person back on the streets then send them to jail.</p>
<p>I mentioned one of the earliest examples of this that I know about in my paper on Felony Murder,Â Regina v. SernÃ© (see:Â <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/14/ive-been-published-my-article-on-felony-murder-is-online-now/"> My Article On Felony Murder Is Online</a>).</p>
<p>A more recent and famous case in point: OJ Simpson. Jurors admitted that they let him off the hook in the criminal trial because it was their way of fighting against the oppressive criminal justice system.</p>
<p>When this happens, it is called jury nullification.</p>
<p>The judge warns the jury that they MUST follow the law, not their emotions. But if they follow their emotion instead of the law there is nothing anyone can do about it. The jury&#8217;s decision is final.</p>
<p>Quite the silver bullet.<span id="more-3854"></span></p>
<p>Of course it is improper for a lawyer to explicitly argue for jury nullification. Lawyers are bound by the rules of the courtroom and if they don&#8217;t follow procedure they can be sanctioned or disbarred. But maybe a lawyer could wear one of those buttons above&#8230;?Â  <img src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f606.png" alt="ðŸ˜†" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>But what if an activist is handing out information to potential jurors urging them to nullify?</p>
<p>Technically it&#8217;s legal. The activist is not telling people to break any law and his speech is protected by the First Amendment. In fact, many Law Review articles have recommended jury nullification in all cases until the justice system becomes more fair to minorities. The authors of theses papers may be hated by prosecutors, but there is nothing they can do to silence them.</p>
<p>The NY Times is reporting that a jury nullification activist named Julain P. Heicklin was handing out his materials outside a court house. Prosceutors had him indicted on the grounds that these pamphlets were tantamount to jury tampering. If found guilty he could go to jail for up to 6 months.</p>
<p>I am not sure that the prosecution will be able to convince a jury that a 78 year old man handing out pamphlets is guilty of jury tampering and even they did, who says they won&#8217;t nullify!?</p>
<p>But the real issue here, as Eugene Volokh writes, is the First Amendment issue. Even if speech is going to cause criminal activity, unless the criminal activity is IMMINENT the speech is protected under Brandenburg v. Ohio. The only way Heicklin&#8217;s speech is likely to be unprotected would be to say that free speech is somewhat suspended in a court or on court house steps. This is a viable argument but Heicklin was on the sidewalk not the court property.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens to the criminal case and if Heicklin is found guilty, you can be certain it will be appealed on First Amendment ground.</p>

<p>Dr. Laura Schlessinger is quitting the over-the-air radio business. She has been forced into a corner with no apparent way out. Her resigning was demanded in the wake of her comments to a caller in which she used racial slurs to illustrate a point.</p>
<p>I am not defending Dr. Laura&#8217;s use of insensitive language, however I do not think she should quit or be asked / forced to quit.</p>
<p>Here is exactly what happened: (<a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/opinions/view/opinion/In-Defense-of-Dr-Laura-4741" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p>
<p>A black woman called the show and told Dr. Laura that</p>
<blockquote><p>her husband is white and his relatives frequently use hurtful racial language around her, including the &#8220;N-word.&#8221; In response, Schlessinger said &#8220;Black guys use it all the time. Turn on HBO, listen to a black comic, and all you hear is n*****, n*****, n*****.&#8221; Schlessinger also told her that &#8220;If you&#8217;re that hypersensitive about color and don&#8217;t have a sense of humor, don&#8217;t marry out of your race.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Predictably, there was a lot of backlash and Dr. Laura was forced to quit.<span id="more-2727"></span></p>
<p>The Dr. Laura flap reminded me of the Helen Thomas fiasco.Â Thomas was also forced to resign in the wake of her insensitive comments as well.</p>
<p>Thomas said something to effect of:</p>
<blockquote><p>Israelis should &#8220;get the hell out of Palestine&#8221; and &#8220;go home&#8221; to Germany and Poland.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thomas took the heat for a few days until she quit.</p>
<p>I think these stories are both tragic.</p>
<p>Yes, in both cases, the comments were insensitive. Would they like to take back their words if they could? Sure. So why don&#8217;t we let them?</p>
<p>Both of these women speak millions of words over the course of their careers. It is inevitable that they will slip up. Why are we so swift to demand they give up their careers? Have we become so sensitive that there is no longer forgiveness?</p>
<p>It goes to a deeper issue as well.</p>
<p>The distillation of thought and narrowing of acceptable speech severely hampers the ability for Americans to debate and discuss issues. The 1st Amendment protects our right to free speech. This right has been described as providing a marketplace of ideas. If we allow whoever yells loudest to bully the marketplace then the marketplace becomes dominated by that voice.</p>
<p>The proper response to speech that you find offensive is not deprive the speaker from speaking further.* It is by explaining why the speech is offensive and offering counter-speech. Discussion and debate. Not calls for resigning.</p>
<p>By allowing bullies to determine who is permitted in the marketplace if ideas and who is not permitted in the marketplace of ideas curtails the effectiveness of that marketplace.</p>
<p>Dr. Laura and Helen Thomas were important voices. They may be infuriating at times and they may have been insensitive. But that is not a reason for their voices to be lost. The marketplace of ideas has fewer voices and that hurts us.</p>
<p>The real losers in their resignations is us.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">*Severe forms of hate speech that are likely to incite violence or compromise the rights of others are not protected by the 1st Amendment.</span></em></p>

<p>I love LA.</p>
<p>Living in LA has its perks. You get great weather 300 days a year, really friendly neighbors, not too many bugs, plenty of excitement, just enough peace and quiet, the Lakers, and a Shul on the Beach (with a lucky Rabbi). But like any big city, there are some drawbacks to living in LA. The traffic, superficiality,Â the helicopters outside my window at 2 AM, the expensive housing, and the schmutz.</p>
<p>What is schmutz? Literally, it means dirt. But in this context it means dirty in a provocative or an overtly sexual manner. (Â© me this very second)<span id="more-2525"></span></p>
<p>Billboards rise like giant monoliths all over the city conveying their messages of sex, wealth and superficial, fleeting &#8220;happiness&#8221;. Now, most of the time I don&#8217;t complain about the billboards. Most billboards are innocuous enough. Some are a little too risque for my tastes, but it is nothing that disrupts my role as a decent human being or a parent. However, the over-hyped, flop of a movie called Sex and the City 2 has crossed the line of decency.</p>
<p>Sex and the City 2 billboards have overtaken the city.</p>
<p>Everywhere you look there is a big ol&#8217; billboard with the giant words &#8220;Sex and the City 2&#8221;.</p>
<p>The word sex can mean one than one thing. But sex &#8220;in the city&#8221; has only one meaning. Sex is not a bad word when used in the right context and in front of the right audience. An inappropriate audience would be a listener who is not old enough to understand what the word means, what it entails and when its use is appropriate. It would be wrong to have an open, frank conversation about sex with a young child.</p>
<p>A seven year old child can read well enough to see the word sex, but is not able to understand the word. There is just no way to have a conversation with a young child about sex. It is not age appropriate.</p>
<p>My son reads all the billboards (and also tons of books) and sometimes he even remembers the words on the billboards. Sometimes he repeats the things he sees on billboards. One day he was muttering to himself &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221;. He says &#8220;I can&#8217;t get it out of my head&#8221;, &#8220;what does it even mean?&#8221;.</p>
<p>&lt;Quick, change the subject&gt;</p>
<p>I know all about &#8220;Free Speech&#8221;. But when an audience does not have a choice or warning about the content of the speech it can be regulated. (<em>See </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission_v._Pacifica_Foundation" target="_blank"><em>FCC v Pacifica</em></a><em>: The Court accepted as compelling, the government&#8217;s interests in 1) shielding children from patently offensive material, and 2) ensuring that unwanted speech does not enter one&#8217;s home. The Court stated that the FCC had the authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience, and gave the FCC broad leeway to determine what constituted indecency in different contexts</em>.) I think this rule could apply to billboards the same way it applies to radio.</p>
<p>The problem is that the speech is being directed at ANYONE who can read, with no warning and no way to shield a child from its message. That includes my son, who was reading simple words like &#8220;sex&#8221; Â (or fox, or dad, or mom, or dog) at the age of 3! Do people think it is appropriate for 3 year old childrenÂ to read words that will be impossible to define for them?! A provocative image is not going to prompt the kinds of questions that a word can. A kid sees a word and can read it, the kid wants to know what it means! What is one supposed to tell their kids?</p>
<p>If someone was asking me what to do, I would probably try and come up with something clever like, &#8220;it&#8217;s an adult word and when you get older you will understand what it means&#8221;. I guess that is the best I can do. But I find it offensive that young children don&#8217;t seem to be considered in what is permissible on a public billboard.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be some level of regulation beyond what exists now. Am I crazy?</p>
