<p>A few weeks ago, I was alerted to a very interesting article in the NY Times that provided some really good food for thought. The article sets its launching point at an ornithological discovery in 2005. A thought to extinct bird was spotted and the evidence was uploaded to the Internet.</p>
<p>It seems that although there was enough evidence for the journal Science, thousands of bird enthusiasts dissected the evidence and have conclusively shown the discovery to have been a hoax (or mistake).</p>
<p>This kind of thing happens all the time. And it&#8217;s been happening for a long time.</p>
<p>Going back to the earliest days of writing, readers would comment, redact, correct, disagree, argue, and question what they were reading by writing notes in the margins or writing glosses or writing something to counter what they had just read. Later, readers of both the original and the subsequent writings would sometimes collect them and publish them together. Sometimes they would fix the errors, other times they would just add the notes of others.</p>
<p>In fact, this is precisely how the Mishna and Talmud were composed.<span id="more-5635"></span> The Mishna is made up of short snippets of Jewish law that were culled from the notes of prior scholars. The compiler, Rabbi Yehuda HaNassi, combined earlier opinions with later opinions and used his judgment to produce the best result for the future of Judaism. The Talmud then records hundreds of years of conversations and annotations on the Mishna. Ravina and Rav Ashi made the final choices about which comments, arguments, proofs, anecdotes, discussions, and clarifications to include.</p>
<p>To a lesser degree the same thing happened with the Midrash, as the author of the NY Times article notes. Throughout Jewish history, scholars have been using this method to develop Jewish law and thought. This is the way many of the Rishonim and Achronim made their way into our daily lives. Rashi on Chumash is a great example of this. He took his favorite interpretations that he found in prior works and now they are found as part of his commentary in almost every Chumash printed. The many commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch follow the same pattern. They had notes in the margins of their copies of the Shulchan Aruch and later printers wished to include them in their new versions of the Shulchan Aruch and now the Shach and Taz are household names.</p>
<p>The NY Times article argues that the Internet creates the same kind of writer to commenter interface. The writer says something. The reader has something to say in return and the result is sometimes beautiful discussion, and other times flamewar. Either way, much of the value in today&#8217;s writing is not found in the original article, it is found in the comments section. Or in the Facebook comments, or the Tweets, or the Reddit threads. Wherever it is found, the readers&#8217; contributions often have a lot of value.</p>
<p>Some bloggers, like <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a>, consistently tout the excellence of the comments on their blog. I tend to agree. DovBear has had some amazing commenters. The posts on this blog don&#8217;t usually generate as robust conversations as the posts on his blog, but when there are good conversations here, the comments become the stars of the show and the posts become basic material for discussion. <em>(Parenthetically, DovBear&#8217;s blog comments from over 7000 posts are on the verge of being lost forever. A tragedy if I ever heard one&#8230;)</em></p>
<p>In the tradition of the redactors and later publishers of the great works of history that integrated the original writings with subsequent comments, the author of the NY Times article suggests that the Internet needs a redactor. The best comments and opinions that follow the original articles need to highlighted somehow, even integrated into the posts. The give and take of the comment thread produces excellent material and oftentimes helps the group come to a better truth. It would be such a shame if all that wisdom was lost in the black hole of cyberspace.</p>
<p>But the real powerful point of the article is that experts and non-experts have an equal voice in the comments. And the crowd has a unique ability to ferret out lies, fools, and fallacies. If we all take our commenting duties seriously, we can help the greater community arrive at truths that may have been otherwise missed, either intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p>When it comes to discourse on religion, clearly there are some ground rules upon which we all need to agree in order to facilitate positive discussion. But when the rules are agreed upon and the discussion is vociferous, yet civil, we can benefit from coming closer to a truth. That is just another of the incredibly powerful uses of the Internet for the orthodox Jew. If we ban it, we lose that opportunity. I don&#8217;t think that it is a stretch to say that the Internet might exist simply for us to make the most of that opportunity and make the future of orthodox Judaism as viable and vibrant as it must be for our children and grandchildren.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SPA-SPAGLOBELOGO.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-5505 alignleft" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SPA-SPAGLOBELOGO.gif" alt="" width="252" height="252" /></a>A lot of the political discourse in American and in Europe revolves around economic models. The bold faced names in the discussion are capitalism and socialism. To be fair, no matter what, the United States will have a hybrid version because we will never get to a place where the system is completely capitalistic without taxation and social programs for the poor nor will we ever have a system of 100% taxation and governmental distribution of wealth.</p>
<p>In America, we are somewhere in the middle. Which is why I find it humorous when people call President Obama a socialist or Romney is touted as a true capitalist. It makes for good sound bites but the truth is that they are fairly close to one another economically. They might be on opposite extremes on the center. But they are not on opposite extremes of the spectrum the way Ayn Rand and Karl Marx are.</p>
<p>One fun argument is what the Bible has to say about these contemporary economic systems. Pretty much any view can be shoehorned into some passage from the Bible. So it is not a strong argument when one invokes scripture seeing as it so open to interpretation. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/03/wwjd/">WWJD?</a>)</p>
<p>However, Jewish Law does not follow the literal translation of scripture.<span id="more-5504"></span> Instead, Jewish Law follows the interpretations and codifications of the rabbis of the Mishnaic period and the analysis and expansion of those laws during the Talmudic period. These are &#8220;The Rabbis&#8221; that are referred to when people say things like &#8220;the rabbis said&#8230;&#8221;. In Hebrew they are known by their Hebrew acronym, Chazal.</p>
<p>The thing with Chazal is that they actually enacted specific legislation and we know the specific rules that they enforced. They are written in black and white in the Talmud. At <a href="http://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/social-legislation-in-the-talmud-isidore-epstein/" target="_blank">Kavvanah Blog</a> Rabbi Isidore Epstein&#8217;s introductory essay to the Talmud was posted and among many other fascinating issues, the essay addresses this particular point.</p>
<p>Rabbi Epstein enumerates dozens of regulatory laws in the Talmud. These are laws that were enacted and enforced by Chazal in a governmental capacity. Anyone who has studied the Talmud is familiar with many of these laws. But to see them rattled off one by one and analyzed through the lens of a 20th century scholar is very eye opening.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of Jewish Laws:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guarantee of public trees from which anyone could pluck</li>
<li>Highly regulated weights and measures</li>
<li>Agencies that regulated quality control of food and other goods</li>
<li>Common rights on real property that was owned</li>
<li>Price control over the sale of chattel</li>
<li>Rights for workers, including going beyond the letter of the law for their benefit</li>
<li>Protection of tenants</li>
<li>Competitive practices when there was no need for additional</li>
<li>Charity taxes that were distributed to the poor</li>
</ul>
<p>This short list does not do it justice. I think it impossible to read the essay and not draw the conclusion that Chazal endorsed a pretty severe form of socialism. That is not to say that they would endorse the same system for the United States of America in 2012. But it is to say, that the most traditional form of economic policy in orthodox Judaism is pretty close to socialism.</p>
<p>I do note that there were protective policies in place that were designed to prevent over-reliance on the social benefits of Rabbinic Judaism and some policies were skewed more to the side of capitalism. However, it is almost impossible to find ideas like <em>caveat emptor</em> or &#8220;the marketplace will decide what is fair or moral&#8221; in their system of commerce.</p>
<p>At the very least, the essay shows that many aspects of a social economy were considered moral and preferable to Chazal.</p>
<p>The essay is a must-read for its economic theory as well as its broader implications that are discussed more fully on Kavvanah. I cannot recommend reading the essay enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_4436" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/article-2013950-0D005B5100000578-413_634x455.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4436" title="Leiby Kletzky Funeral" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/article-2013950-0D005B5100000578-413_634x455-300x215.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="215" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Leiby Kletzky&#39;s Funeral</p></div>
<p>The Mishna teaches us, חיב אדם לברך על הרעה כשם שהוא מברך על הטובה. &#8220;One is obligated to bless the negative the same way one is obligated to bless the positive&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Rambam understands this to mean that since we do not know what the end of the story will be, it is not rational to be angry or upset when things go wrong. The isolated moment may seem too difficult to bear, but that is because our vision is limited to the moment.</p>
<p>This can be understood one of two ways. One is that we may never know why bad things happen, but we can know that we cannot understand them because our vision is limited. Therefore we should bless the bad with the good and trust that it will be good eventually. I believe this is a difficult position. What good can come from a vile murder and what good can come when the murderer is from our own community?</p>
<p>There is a second approach.<span id="more-4435"></span> This approach holds that we can write our own ending to the story. The horrible events are part of a larger picture, but that picture is not complete. We can finish that picture, write our own ending. Sometimes the greatest redemption comes from the most difficult times. We bless the bad with the good because we believe that the terrible tragedy that occurred will bring about change and improvements. It may hurt a lot. But it is something worthy of blessing.</p>
<p>This is what I referred to when I wrote that there is a <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/07/13/orthodox-jewish-boy-found-brutally-murdered/" target="_blank">silver lining in dark cloud</a>**.</p>
<p>I believe there is an opportunity for our community to refocus on one broad issue and one specific issue that arise from this nightmare.</p>
<p>The broad issue requires some background. Ashkenazik Jews, for the most part, were persecuted mercilessly by their overlords. For 1000 years Jews lived in fear of their non-Jewish neighbors, were picked on by their local and national governments, were the scapegoats for major events and eventually it all ended with the Holocaust. That is the 1000 year legacy of Ashkenazik Jewry. It has had a major effect on the collective psyche of the Ashkenazik Jew. It leaves an indelible mark of victimhood and fear of the outsider. It has spawned the insular Orthodox Jewish communities of Boro Park, Flatbush, Williamsburg, Monsey, Lakewood, Kiryas Joel and others. It has fueled an anti-Semitism paranoia where the &#8220;other&#8221; is to be feared, possibly loathed but always looked upon with skepticism. It has created a social system that works hard to prevent the &#8220;outside&#8221; from coming in because the outside is scary, the inside is safe. Social issues within the orthodox community are frequently blamed on the outside influences and have become, in an ironic twist, the scapegoat for the community&#8217;s problems.</p>
<p>However, this has had two negative side affects. First, it teaches us that we need to fear the outside, and if we don&#8217;t shut it out, we will lose what we have. This is not a true statement. Many of our great rabbis and leaders since the times of the Mishna were active on the &#8220;outside&#8221;. They held jobs, interacted with the people of their day who were not from their community and taught their communities how to appreciate their beautiful Jewish tradition, live a committed life and still be a participant in the outside world. But 1000 years of hate and persecution has created an environment where we focus less on what is special and unique and worthwhile on the inside and more on what is wrong, corrupt and evil on the outside.</p>
<p>We definitely lose something with our collective reticence to participating in the outside. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/11/obligatory-ted-williams-post/" target="_blank">I have quoted LeAnne Tuohy</a> as saying that the cure for cancer may be in our inner cities. But it may never be discovered because of all the great minds we lose to inner city culture and violence. A similar thought might be said about the insular Jewish communities. Who knows what we might be losing by limiting our opportunities?</p>
<p>The second, perhaps more nefarious side effect, is that it creates a level of comfort on the inside that falsely promises that everything inside is safe. If all the evil is outside then the inside is completely safe. While the inside is generally made up of wonderful, charitable, righteous people, they are not the only people on the inside. Nothing could be more wrong. There is evil in our midst as well. There is abuse, there is crime, there is corruption, there is bigotry, there are some rotten people. They are few and far between, but they are there. But by focusing so much on the evil on the outside, we have come to allow, and by implication, give tacit approval to the evil on the inside. Feeling that we can trust anybody with the orthodox Jewish uniform is a shaky proposition. It always has been, but now it is more clear than ever before.</p>
<p>The inside has a history of protecting its own. Even when its own are bad people. The over-emphasis on how bad it is on the outside has given a virtual playground for the predators among us to thrive on the inside.</p>
<p>And so, the Leiby Kletzky nightmare has us waking up in a cold sweat. The challenge for us is to manufacture our own silver lining. We need to write the end of the story by righting the ship.</p>
<p>I believe that we can learn from this horrible incident that the current social structure and strictures in our insular communities may be beginning to harm us as much as they have helped us. Broadly, it harms us because it limits our opportunities and specifically it harms us because it has allowed us to protect the most dangerous people in our communities.</p>
<p>Turning for a moment to Levi Aron, I believe we failed him and ourselves as a society. His mental illness went untreated, his anti-social behavior raised no flags, his &#8220;creepiness&#8221; was not something to consider but one thing above all is what allowed this to happen. In an environment where everyone is presumed safe, a man with the right uniform isn&#8217;t considered a stranger. A man who invites a different child into his car earlier in the day is not reported because it does not even occur to people that the man may be dangerous. I am not saying that Aron was clearly dangerous, but I am saying that warning signs existed. In a community where warning signs are ignored because they can&#8217;t possibly be warning of something calamitous, because the inside is always safe, we can find ourselves in the middle of a nightmare.</p>
<p>It is my sincere hope that my words have not offended anybody. I don&#8217;t place any blame on anyone involved in the story not name Levi Aron. A social structure and community are not choices that individuals make. They evolve and sometimes we need something to shape the next stage of their evolution.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope this will be a start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
