				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/logo.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4898" title="logo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/logo-300x73.png" alt="" width="300" height="73" /></a>Several online news publications reported on the YU Beacon controversy from this past week. The Beacon is a student newspaper at Yeshiva University. It is a student voice for Yeshiva College and Stern College.</p>
<p>The controversy arose from a particular article that was authored anonymously. I will not get into the details of the content of the article. Generally, it was about a young woman studying at Stern who lapsed in her observance in a hotel room with a fellow observant Jewish male. The article&#8217;s entire point was that while it may have been exhilarating, it was shameful and she was full of regret.</p>
<p>An objective reading of the article would lead to several conclusions.<span id="more-4897"></span></p>
<p>1) There is a tension in the YU community regarding intimacy before marriage.<br />
2) There are some people who breach the barriers of halacha and are intimate before marriage.<br />
3) The culture of YU does not &#8220;accept&#8221; this as normative behavior and it is considered shameful.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t find any of these conclusions to be super offensive. I don&#8217;t think they place Jews in a poor light. I don&#8217;t think they place Modern Orthodox Jews in particular in a bad light either.</p>
<p>What happened next complicated things.</p>
<p>Apparently, MANY students complained that this article was offensive. It was pulled temporarily. After a meeting between the student council, The Beacon editors and some YU administrators, the article was reposted with a disclaimer and The Beacon is now independent of YU.</p>
<p>The next level of analysis that always follows instances such as these is &#8211; Was this a kiddush Hashem or a Chillul Hashem?</p>
<p>The answer is both. And neither. Every part of the story has nuances that can be interpreted as positive and negative. Which means, that like most things controversial, it cannot be decided by one metric. I don&#8217;t use the words Kiddush and Chillul Hashem willy nilly, instead I will just use the words positive and negative. What follows is my personal analysis.</p>
<p><em>DISCLAIMERs: I am not a YU alum. I have never even been to the Yeshiva part of the University. I have been the High School twice and to the Seforim sale once. Also, I have written for The Beacon.</em></p>
<p>The article was titillating. It was in a YU publication. I think that may have been negative. A school newspaper should reflect the student body. Much of the student body does not want erotica in their newspaper. The article could have been interpreted as erotica.</p>
<p>But the message was positive. I think that is clear. The message is that we all struggle. We all feel guilty when we fail. But most of all, we all try to pick ourselves up and stay true to the values in our community based on Torah.</p>
<p>Taking down the article in response to outrage was also positive. A student newspaper should reflect the mores and mentality of the student body. When it fails to do so, it should reconsider publishing the offending material. In this case, the outrage was so severe that it warranted removal.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would have been more prudent, mature and wise not get so worked up over the article. But college students can be very headstrong. Their minds were made. I think the outrage was a negative.</p>
<p>But the end game was completely dissatisfying. The Beacon dug in its heels standing up for some moral principle and refused to back down in the face of bullies. The student council did not back down either. They forced the Beacon&#8217;s hand. Both sides were stubborn and both sides reflected negatively.</p>
<p>Where is the publicity over this? On which point is the media focusing? That is the key question. If it is simply noting the stubbornness of two student organizations then that is clearly a negative portrayal. But if the media&#8217;s focus is on the more mature and positive elements of this story, I think we can say that we are neutral at worst and positive at best. In that case, perhaps there was a Kiddush Hashem here. Perhaps.</p>
<p>As for me, I wouldn&#8217;t have published the article. I also would not have complained if the article were published.</p>
<p>A note on censorship and freedom of the press: In an environment that mixes secular and religious values as YU claims to do, sometimes one of those value systems must trump the other. If the religious value system says that publication is not wise, then you can can cry freedom of the press and marketplace of ideas as much as you want, but in the end, sometimes religion wins out. Sometimes, freedom of speech loses to restrictions of religion. I agree that a conversation about the content of the article is a good thing. I don&#8217;t know that the manner in which this article was executed was perfect nor do I think the negativity towards it was perfect either.</p>
<p>I do hope that the article will serve its purpose. I hope that it will promote discussion and discourse on this very important issue and that after all is said and done we will all emerge wiser, more devout and committed to our religious values.</p>
