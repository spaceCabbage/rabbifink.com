				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://Daf.finkorswim.com"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6092" title="wasserzeichen-projekte.php_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wasserzeichen-projekte.php_-300x100.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="100" /></a>As I mentioned previously, (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/07/31/ode-to-the-siyum-hashas/">Ode to the Siyum HaShas</a>) the Siyum HaShas is a great source of inspiration for me and for many others.  The simplest way to channel that inspiration is to attempt to join the hundreds of thousands of Daf Yomi learners as the program begins from the start of the Talmud on Thursday.</p>
<p>I want to count myself among the many Daf Yomi students and would also like my shul to be a place where Daf Yomi is studied. I also love learning and teaching Talmud. So we have formulated and implemented a Daf Yomi plan at <a href="pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a> and we are including all of you.</p>
<p>I have set up a new site at <a href="http://daf.finkorswim.com" target="_blank">Daf.Finkorswim.com</a>.<span id="more-6091"></span> On that site I will be posting videos and podcasts of every daf. The live classes are being held in advance of the daf schedule so they will be available online on the daf schedule. You can subscribe to the YouTube Channel for the videos or to the podcasts in iTunes, or just visit the site daily. The daf podcasts are separate from the non-daf podcasts. Hopefully we can keep pace and hopefully the online community will make use of the site.</p>
<p>The style of the class will be a fast paced run through the daf. The assumption will be that you do not need any prior Talmud experience to understand the class or appreciate the material. I hope to keep each class between 20-30 minutes. There are many resources on other sites if you want to go more in depth, my idea is to make it as simple and accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>So, if you are interested in joining the Daf Yomi program I have made it pretty easy to do from the comfort of your home, your car, your lunch break, wherever, and I hope you will avail yourself to the new site. If you have any suggestions please send them my way.</p>

My apologies. Now that the bar exam is over, Tisha B&#8217;Av afternoon provided a great opportunity to play catch-up. It took a long time, but we are finally up to date.</p>
<p>So if you were one of the people who used to listen to my classes online, we are back in business.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve updated the Podcasts page so all the classes are there. But I think it&#8217;s way cooler to listen on iTunes. You can subscribe and new classes magically appear in your iTunes after I publish them. iTunes also lets you listen without downloading in the iTunes Store and they even provides audio links in your browser so you can listen even if you don&#8217;t use iTunes. You can also listen on the individual class posts (that works on mobile as well).</p>
<p>I hope to stay on top of the podcasting from here on out. If you do listen feel free to email me with questions, thoughts, or suggestions.</p>

		<itunes:summary>The Rambam class continued today.

Today we began the next section of Sefer Mada and began Hilchos Talmud Torah. The Rambam clearly delineates the obligations of Torah study and upon whom the obligation to teach children lies. We also explored the fascinating question of whose education is primary - the father or the son.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.

		<itunes:summary>Following a bit of an extended leave the Rambam class resumed today.

We completed our study of Chapter 5. We learned of the huge responsibility those who are representatives of God bear with regard to sanctification and desecration of God&#039;s name. We also began Chapter 6 and the topic of erasing or destroying the written name of God. Some interesting tangential discussions arose including some talk of the Cairo Geniza.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.

It was a memorable evening in more ways than one. (Read about it here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/02/my-appearance-at-a-night-for-the-family-at-pepperdine-university/" target="_blank">A Night for Family</a>.)</p>
<p>I was asked to speak before a crowd that had just enjoyed seeing the life of Corrie ten Boom performed.</p>
<p>One message of that story is that is good, moral decisions do not happen in a vacuum. Children learn from their parents.</p>
<p>But how are we to instill the lessons we want our children to learn?</p>
<p>I was supposed to try and answer that question in 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Decide for yourself if I was mildly successful&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prayer is something so basic to all faiths and religions. Jewish ideas of prayer are decidedly different from other cultures. It is very important to learn about the Jewish approach to prayer.</p>

<p>We asked all the basic questions about prayer. We asked some advanced questions about prayer.</p>
<p>Using ideas from Rabbi Chaim Volozhin and others we pieced together a rational approach to prayer that made sense to us.</p>
