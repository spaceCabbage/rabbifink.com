				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The term Rationalist Judaism has been clanking around the Internet and Orthodox Jewish conversation for a while now. It’s not quite a movement, but there are some very strong contemporary voices behind Rationalist Judaism. Many people think the term is an oxymoron. Others think it is intellectually dishonest. Yet others think it is heresy. But without a working definition or at least a framework to understand what we are talking about, any conversation about Rationalist Judaism will result in people talking past one another and miscommunication.<span id="more-7938"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7939" alt="Thinking-Man-Rodin" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>First, to address the complaint that calling one brand of Judaism “Rationalist” is insulting or offensive to everyone else. It sure seems like the term is implying that everyone else is irrational. This is not the correct implication. Rationalist Judaism is not to the exclusion of irrationality. Instead it is to exclusion of supernaturalism. That’s not to say that mysticism is inherently irrational either. Maybe it is for some. These are just the words that are used to describe two different approaches to God and Judaism. Words are often cumbersome and imprecise. That is the case here. We don’t mean to say Rationalist Judaism is rational and everyone else is irrational.</p>
<p>In general, rationalism literally means to use reason above all else. In this view, truth can be deduced and is not subject to fallacies like appeals to authority or <em>argumentum ad populum</em>. Obviously, a religious person maintains some belief in authority and relies on some subjective baseline truths that cannot be logically argued. But we are not talking about pure rationalism. We are talking about Rationalist Judaism.</p>
<p>I believe that term Rationalist Judaism was adapted from the term Theistic Rationalism. Both groups share some common principles. The basic idea of both groups is to release theology from supernaturalism and focus on morality. To the extent that supernaturalism can be justifiably removed from religion, Rationalist Judaism holds it should be removed. That is all Rationalist Judaism really means.</p>
<p>There are several heroes and champions of this concept, none greater than Rambam. In his halachic and philosophical works, Rambam sought to eliminate superstition, mysticism, and supernaturalism from Judaism to the greatest extent possible. One overriding theme of his works is that there is nothing supernatural other than God. Giving power to charms, incantations, or even angels is akin to idol worship. He held that belief in God was logical. He held that prophecy was a natural result of perfection. He held that God rarely intervenes with nature. He held that <em>Mitzvos</em> have material benefits for the person who performs the Mitzvah. He held that astrology was bunk. He held that God conformed the Torah to the needs of mankind. He held that <em>Maaseh Breishis</em> was science. He held that <em>Maaseh </em><em>Merkava</em>h was metaphysics. There is not a single mystical idea mentioned in any of his books. It’s as if there is no such thing as mysticism in Rambam’s universe.</p>
<p>Some have tried to argue that Rambam was a mystic and obscured his true views. This has been thoroughly debunked by many great scholars and if you are of this mind, I direct you to this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906764158" target="_blank">Maimonides’ Confrontation with Mysticism</a></p>
<p>There are many other examples of great Torah authorities who used similar principles in their halachic, or philosophical, or exegetical works. R’ Samson Raphael Hirsch wrote Horeb, a book of the philosophy of <em>mitzvos</em> without a single kabbalistic reference. The entire book makes sense of Torah Judaism and it all works even if one rejects mysticism.</p>
<p>Ralbag is another. His commentary on Chumash literally reinterprets examples of supernatural events into metaphors or visions instead of real life occurrences. His worldview fit this same broad category. To the extent that supernaturalism could be excised from Torah and Judaism, he saw to it that they were.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Rationalist Judaism. It’s a tradition that has a long and powerful chain of great Torah luminaries who lived by this philosophy.</p>
<p>Another important element of Rationalist Judaism is that because God’s intervention and communication with man is so limited, the Mesorah and Holy texts of Judaism are more subject to error than one who believes that God ensures the truth of everything. In the opposing view, God’s essence permeates the writings of men like the great Talmudic scholars known as Chazal. Thus, their writings are presumed to be free of mistakes or misjudgments. Rationalist Judaism holds that the best efforts of man can still result in error. This is especially true in matters that are not Torah specific. We refer here to math, science, history, medicine, and other disciplines not directly related to Torah. However, even if Chazal were to err in issues of halacha or Torah specific interpretation, it would not matter as they have the authority to establish the laws for the Jewish people.</p>
<p>It’s true that this sort of thinking led many people to conclusions that we would reject today. Rambam himself was of the belief that God’s existence is provable. Rambam also thought Aristotelian philosophy and science were as true as God’s word in the Torah. We know that both of these are actually untrue. Does this mean that Rationalist Judaism is wrong? Of course not.</p>
<p>In fact, only someone whose paradigm is that Torah authorities are infallible would argue that by disproving Aristotle the entire worldview of Rambam is incorrect. But the paradigm of Rationalist Judaism does not allow for this sort of thinking. People do err, only God is infallible. So Rambam dealt with truth in the same way Chazal dealt with truth. That is, they were subject to the thinking and common beliefs of their time. We are also subject to the thinking and common beliefs of our time. Therefore, we are also supposed to look at Torah through the prism of modern thinking. No one actually pretends that Rambam was a Modern Orthodox Jew of 2013 America. But his worldview is one that allows, or even requires, using contemporary thinking to build one’s Jewish life. That’s what Chazal did and that is what Rambam did and that is what we are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Rambam is not making the claim that Chazal and the prophets before them lived and believed the same way he believed. Rather he is making the argument that with the same information available to Rambam they would have drawn the same conclusions as Rambam. Further, he demonstrates that so much of what they did say is compatible with his Aristotelian, Islamic influenced philosophy. However, even if they would have not reached the same conclusions, they would have used all the available information and evidence to formulate their views. That is what Rationalist Judaism attempts to do as it has always attempted to do.</p>
<p>But what’s the point of all this? Isn’t it obvious that there are supernatural forces and that Judaism believes in mysticism?</p>
<p>The answer to this very serious question is that Rambam held that these were all corruptions. In his view, true Judaism does not have any of the trappings of a supernaturalist cult. God is supernatural, a few miracles that were necessary for the birth of our nation occurred in Biblical times, but other than that, Judaism is a religion that is supposed to be hyper-focused on the practical matters of personal growth and emulating God in our lives.</p>
<p>Sure, many great people introduced mystical or supernatural elements into Judaism. Most people believe in them too. But in Rambam’s view, these are human additions and emendations. They are not integral to serving God, and may in fact harm our service of God.</p>
<p>For someone who believes in the supernatural and mystical this all sounds crazy. That’s fine. However, not everyone is predisposed to believing in things that they can’t see or prove. Those people may still be willing to suspend their disbelief or skepticism and believe in God or even in Divine Revelation. However, if they are not required to believe in mysticism and its trappings of Zoharic and Lurianic kabbalism, the ties to astrology, the use of charms and <em>segulos</em>, the existence of demons, the belief that human beings can be infallible, the idea that Chazal had access to modern science (but didn’t tell everyone about penicillin), that God still communicates with humans (but only to Orthodox Jews), and many other beliefs that require active supernaturalism and a healthy dose of non-skepticism, then why should they believe in those things? Further, if they were required to believe in these things, would it surprise us if they rejected the entire package? No, it would not. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/16/judaism-of-the-future-my-response-to-klal-perspectives-spring-2012/" target="_blank">Judaism of the Future: My Response to Klal Perspectives Spring 2012</a>)</p>
<p>Rationalist Judaism is a real thing. It’s not a fantasy. It’s not a boogeyman that seeks to demonize those who believe in supernatural Judaism. It’s an alternative for people who are more skeptical. It’s a way of serving God without being forced to believe in an entire universe that stretches beyond what is acceptable in their view. There are other side benefits to this perspective. Some of them have already been discussed on this and other blogs. One of those benefits will be the subject of a future post.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that one can practice Orthodox Judaism and love God and make a Kiddush Hashem without mysticism. It still works. Perhaps it even works better. But no matter how one practices their Judaism, it is wise to establish both views as viable options. In this way, we can ensure that the personality types that are drawn to mysticism and skepticism have a place in Orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ami Magazine published an article by Sara Yocheved Rigler that would have many of our Geonim and Rishonim turning over in their graves. In a nutshell, the article describes strange phenomena such as fear of Nazi related imagery or fear of situations that might be similar to Holocaust experiences. The people experiencing these things are not able to explain why they have these fears.</p>
<p>According to the article, these are manifestations of reincarnated souls from the Holocaust. That is the only explanation given for these oddities (which are not very odd at all). In fact, the article goes so far as to suggest that non-Jews are also reincarnated with Jewish souls from the Holocaust and this is what draws them toward conversion. Of course this is problematic because those who believe in reincarnation and recycling of souls also believe that souls only transmigrate from Jew to Jew and non-Jews are given new souls with each birth. This is waved away by a rabbi quoted in the article who says if you wanted to be a non-Jew in a previous life you come back as a non-Jew.</p>
<p>I have three basic issues with this article.<span id="more-7676"></span></p>
<p>1. It is disingenuous because it uses anecdotes from people who do not necessarily agree with the article as support for the article&#8217;s ideas. For example, Rabbi Berel Wein is quoted at the beginning of the article. He related that the Ponevezher Rav once said to a group of young couples in Miami that their job was to repopulate the world with Jews in the aftermath of the Holocaust. That is a common Jewish sentiment from the mid-20th century. The problem is that it is being used as some sort of support for the idea that Jews born in America are reincarnations of people who perished in the Holocaust. He said nothing of the sort. He meant nothing of the sort. There is simply no reason to think he did.</p>
<p>Another similar example is using R&#8217; Lau&#8217;s recollection of the Holocaust. He famously said that experiencing the Holocaust as a child left him with three strong memories. Dogs, boots, and trains. This is somehow used as support for the idea that someone who is afraid of boots is reincarnated from someone who perished in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Neither of those stories has anything to do with reincarnation. But it gives the article &#8220;credence&#8221; to toss a few familiar names into the article to prove irrelevant, agreed upon points.</p>
<p>2. Stay away from the Holocaust. Trying to explain Holocaust deaths as <em>tikkun</em> and a way of cleansing a soul is offensive. We don&#8217;t know why people die. We don&#8217;t even know if there is always a reason that people die. To try to make death feel better because it&#8217;s part of a giant soul reincarnation cleansing plan is no better than saying they died because of their sins. It&#8217;s ugly.</p>
<p>But more importantly, it demonstrates that the real reason reincarnation is being discussed in this context is to make us feel better. We don&#8217;t understand death and destruction so we explain it with reincarnation. We don&#8217;t understand how millions could die for no reason so we explain it with reincarnation. We can&#8217;t explain a fear of showers or boots so it must be reincarnated souls from the Holocaust. There might be better answers to these questions. But the article does not explore them. Using the emotional appeal of the Holocaust to draw us into a reincarnation narrative is inappropriate.</p>
<p>3. Most importantly, reincarnation is a very controversial subject in Judaism. It&#8217;s not mentioned in Tanach. It&#8217;s not mentioned in the Talmud or Medrash. It&#8217;s rejected by most of the Geonim. It is rejected or ignored by many of the mainstream Rishonim. It serves no theological purpose other than to explain things that might be able to be explained in another way.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Gilgul-Ami.pdf"><br />
</a></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7678" alt="img-kickstartbusiness" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/img-kickstartbusiness.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The article jumps right into reincarnation without a moment&#8217;s consideration of the very prominent Torah authority figures that reject reincarnation. This is at worst a lie and at best ignorance. But either way it is incomplete. Gilgul is not a necessary belief in orthodox Judaism. In fact, it might be worst to believe in it than not to believe in it. Why are we normalizing this kind of thing? Why are we discarding the valid opinions that don&#8217;t hold of gilgul? Why is it okay to just side with the Arizal on everything and forget about everyone else?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to make the complete case against gilgul here. But I will make a couple of points.</p>
<p>The Ancient Greeks believed in reincarnation. We did not. We knew their beliefs and we rejected them in the time of Chazal. It&#8217;s impossible to say that Jews did not talk about reincarnation because they just didn&#8217;t know that it could exist. It was known and it was not accepted. It began to be accepted by a select few Rishonim after being rejected by the two most prominent early Rishonim that discuss Hashkafa, Rambam and Rabbi Judah HaLevi. The one prominent Rishon who does mention gilgul is Ramban and he does so at the expense of an interpretation on the verse that is in Chazal. In other words, they had a different explanation for the verse. The interpretation of Ramban contradicts Chazal.</p>
<p>In the 15th and 16th century there was a renewed interest in this sort of thing. Dybbuks also became more popular in this period. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/21/book-review-between-worlds-dybbuks-exorcists-and-early-modern-judaism/">Between Worlds: Dybbuks, Exorcists, and Early Modern Judaism </a>) But it&#8217;s no fait accompli that gilguls and dybbuks are part of Judaism. We have no idea if it&#8217;s true and our early sources say that it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a positive development that these beliefs have gone mainstream. They are too easy to reject and cast aspersion on the more vital parts of Judaism. We don&#8217;t need this stuff in Judaism and it doesn&#8217;t improve our lives. Why are we so willing and eager to embrace it in our publications without question? This is my little protest. Don&#8217;t force these beliefs down our throats. It&#8217;s not integral to Judaism.</p>
<p><em>(Note: Reincarnation at the times of Messiah has nothing to do with this discussion.)</em></p>

Just when we all started learning about the laws of chametz and matzah, the Times runs a front page above the fold story on Satmar A (as opposed to Satmar Z) protocols for matzah baking. It seems that Satmar A, and maybe others I really don&#8217;t know, are not satisfied with the &#8220;<em>shmura m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; and add an extra layer of stringency. They are careful to use wheat that did not even become wet while it was growing. They grow wheat on a far flung farm in Arizona where there is no rain for months while the wheat grows.</p>
<p>Why do they do this?</p>
<p>Halacha requires that we use &#8220;Shmurah Matzah&#8221; at the Seder (and some authorities say all Pesach). Shmura Matzah is not synonymous with round, dark matzah. Matzah can be Shmurah and any shape. Shmurah means that the ingredients for the Matzah were watched to ensure that the grains did not become leaven by coming in contact with water and not being baked within 18 minutes. There are three opinions in halacha as to when the ingredients for matzah must be &#8220;watched&#8221; in order to qualify for &#8220;Shmurah Matzah.&#8221; The most &#8220;watched&#8221; that halacha requires in that the wheat be watched from the time of harvesting. That is why most Matzah says &#8220;<em>Shmurah m&#8217;shaas ketzira</em>&#8221; &#8211; watched from the time of reaping.</p>
<p>There are no opinions in halacha that require that the grains not come in contact with water before they are reaped. None that I could find at least.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on here?<span id="more-7290"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times tells us exactly what is going on here. Here is what Professor Samuel Heilman has to say:</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;the competition between the two Satmar groups — each led by one of two brothers — was about one-upmanship.</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“One is always looking to be more authoritative than the other,” Professor Heilman said, “and one of the ways they’re making this happen is over matzo — our matzo is more kosher than yours, we’re more scrupulous and careful over matzo baking than you are.”</em></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">One-upmanship in halacha. Nailed it. When so many of us are mitzvah observant we need to do things to signal to others that we are different. We are better. That signal is the extra level of stringency that is completely unnecessary. For more on this social phenomenon check this out: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/19/suggestion-read-judaism-as-a-first-language-right-now/">Judaism as a First Language</a></p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">But I think there is something more happening here. While it is true that there may be nothing wrong with being extra stringent, this kind of stringency borders on silliness. The concern that created the requirement to use Shmurah Matzah is that the wheat will actually become chametz. If water comes in contact with flour while it is in storage the wheat can become chametz. That&#8217;s science. But it is literally impossible for grains that are still growing to become Chametz. Impossible. In much the same way that it is impossible for cooked matzah to become chametz if it comes in contact with liquid. Yet, there are thousands of Jews who don&#8217;t eat <em>gebrukst </em>because of that very concern.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Adding stringencies like <em>gebrukst</em> and growing wheat where there is no rain only makes sense in one context. If Judaism is a magical, mystical, mystery and our rational minds are useless to understand the laws of Judaism then it does not matter that there is no possibility of becoming chametz. All that matters is that water and wheat do not come in contact ever. Even if the prohibition is against chametz and not all wheat and water become chametz it does not matter. But if Judaism is a religion with Divine instructions that are supposed to be understood as rationally as possible and the rules tell us what our concerns are supposed to be, there is not place for non-sensical stringencies.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">When it comes to chametz, we are given specific instructions as to what the prohibition entails. The law requires us to be careful not to let the wheat and water ferment and begin to rise. It&#8217;s based on science. Anything that could help prevent that from happening is a reasonable stringency. But once we get into the kind of stringencies that will not prevent a violation of a prohibition, it is hard to see their value unless we say something magical is happening and that wheat and water may never touch. The thing is, that&#8217;s not what the Torah, Talmud, Shulchan Aruch, and responsa tell us. To them, it has nothing to do with science. It has everything to do mysticism.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">Now I think I can understand why the NY Times found this so interesting. Growing wheat in Arizona so it doesn&#8217;t rain on the wheat? It&#8217;s irrational. It is religion without reason. It&#8217;s exotic, archaic, and mystical. It&#8217;s not the Judaism that so many of us practice. It&#8217;s a Judaism that almost purposely does not make rational sense and is purely mystical. That&#8217;s front page news.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6919" alt="A-7-toward-A-8" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A-7-toward-A-8.jpg?resize=300%2C203" data-recalc-dims="1" />It&#8217;s amazing how often I can be talking with someone about Rambam and they are surprised when I tell them that it seems to me that Maimonides rejected mysticism. I am almost certain of it and I can show how it is a very nearly impossible presumption to disprove. But greater minds than mine have either doubted or rejected this claim so I try to keep an open mind.</p>
<p>There are four typical responses when people first hear that Rambam rejected mysticism:</p>
<p>1) It&#8217;s not true. They&#8217;ll quote the Brisker Rav who supposedly said that every line in the Moreh Nevuchim is based on 100 lines in the Zohar. Or the the Lubavitch view that Rambam was such a deep writer that it only appears to be &#8220;nigleh&#8221; but really it&#8217;s all nistar.</p>
<p>2) Nebach, Rambam never had a chance to learn real kabbalah because he was isolated. But if he did, he would have been a mystic for sure.</p>
<p>3) Of course Rambam held of mysticism, he just did not anything mystical in his books for some reason. [Insert reason]
<p>4) That&#8217;s cool. Tell me more.</p>
<p>I teach a Rambam class on Sunday mornings.<span id="more-6904"></span> We just learn Mishneh Torah and I provide insights based on the commentaries and my own personal experiences. From time to time, we learn a law in the text that reaffirms the rationalistic tendencies of Rambam. Here is an example.</p>
<p>מי שנידוהו בחלום אפילו ידע מי נידהו צריך עשרה בני אדם ששונין הלכות להתירו מנידויו ואם לא מצא טורח אחריהם עד פרסא לא מצא מתירים לו אפילו עשרה ששונים משנה לא מצא מתירין לו עשרה שיודעים לקרות בתורה לא מצא מתירין לו אפילו עשרה שאינן יודעין לקרות לא מצא במקומו עשרה מתירין לו אפילו שלשה.</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means if someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication. If he can&#8217;t find 10 people he should walk up to a <em>parsa</em> to find the requisite number of people.</p>
<p>From where does Rambam get this law? From the Talmud.</p>
<p>(אמר רב יוסף: נידוהו בחלום, צריך עשרה בני אדם להתיר לו.והוא דתנו הלכתא; אבל מתנו ולא תנו, לא. ואי ליכא דתנו הלכתא, אפילו מתנו ולא תנו.ואי ליכא, ליזיל וליתב אפרשת דרכים, ויהיב שלמא לבי עשרה, עד דמקלעי ליה עשרה דגמרי הלכתא. (נדרים ח א</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means that someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication, if he can&#8217;t find 1o people he should wait at the פרשת דרכים &#8211; junction &#8211; until he finds enough people.</p>
<p>The medieval commentators explain why he should go to the junction. Some say that he should greet everyone who he sees with a Shalom Aleichem and they will reply Aleichem Shalom. This will protect him from the apparent decree that has been decided against him as shown by the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>This interpretation assumes that the blessing of Aleichem Shalom actually protects someone. This is a mystical idea.</p>
<p>Rambam is uncomfortable with this idea. So either he uses a variant text (I have not seen any manuscripts with this text) or he changes the words פרשת דרכים to the word פרסא. They sound similar, but they have completely different meanings in this context. If you go with the concept found in the Talmud you are relying on mysticism to &#8220;keep you safe&#8221; until you can properly nullify the dreamy excommunication. If you go with Rambam&#8217;s version, it&#8217;s just a limitation on how far one must go to find people to nullify the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the explanation for this law in the Mishneh Torah has nothing to do with mysticism and rationalism? Sure. But the most elegant explanation is that Rambam made a conscious choice to excise this mystical idea from his book of law. Especially when you consider this example among the mountains of other similar instances.</p>
<p>All this means is that Rambam seems to have made an effort to be as rationalist as possible in the Mishneh Torah. Further conclusions are conjecture. Personally, when I see 100 signs telling me to go one direction, I figure that I should go in that direction. To me it seems that Rambam theologically rejected mysticism in every instance possible.</p>

<p>Maimonides was a hyper-rationalist. He did not believe in mysticism and fought vehemently against it. One aspect of mysticism is praying at tombs of holy people. Yet, for hundreds of years people have made pilgrimage to Tiberias in the north of Israel to pay respect a the grave of Maimonides and pray at his tomb.</p>
<p>Compared with other holy sites, the tomb of Maimonides is in need of renovations and a facelift. A $10 million project will spruce up the tomb and make it more inviting for visitors.</p>
<p>The problem is that Maimonides himself felt strongly that one should not make a grave into a holy site.</p>
<p>As Rabbi Donniel Hartmann paraphrased the words of Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah:  &#8220;For holy men, no headstones should be built on their graves because their words are their memory&#8230; and people should not visit graves.&#8221; It&#8217;s pretty clear that Maimonides would not be in favor of this renovation or visitors to his tomb.<span id="more-5512"></span></p>
<p>So is it ironic? Or a chutzpah?</p>
<p>It feels similar to Mormons baptizing Jews. It&#8217;s one religious group using their beliefs in an ironic way. Jews don&#8217;t believe in Jesus so we don&#8217;t really care for the Baptism. But Mormons feel like they are doing us a favor. Similarly, Maimonides didn&#8217;t believe in praying at grave sites, but mystics probably feel like they are doing him a favor by praying at his site even though they must think that he was wrong about the whole not praying at grave sites thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, I find it amusing.</p>
<p>I saved this post for International Jewish Mysticism Day (otherwise known as Lag B&#8217;Omer) to lodge a tiny rationalist counterbalance against the overwhelming mysticism of the day. That is my way of being ironic.</p>

I have nothing particularly new to add to the foray but I do have an insight about the way the lines are drawn in this conflict that may help others understand exactly what is really going on. Every source in this post is found in previous writings. This post is a very broad summary with an important implication.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start at the beginning. The Mishna in Mesechta Shabbos says that we perform a circumcision on Shabbos and also metzitza (suction on the wound to draw out the blood) is performed. Apparently the metzitza was done by placing the mouth on the wound and sucking  The Gemara and the Rambam explain that metzitza is done to promote healing and prevent unnecessary harm from befalling the infant. This is clearly a medical concern. As Dr. Shlomo Sprecher shows in his masterful article on the subject, this was the common view of medicine at the time of the Talmud and through the era of Maimonides. Similar medical views are found in the premier medical treatise of the era, Galen&#8217;s Corpus.<span id="more-5347"></span></p>
<p>In the 19th century, the Jewish community became aware that the medical benefits of metzitza were likely outweighed by the potential harms of metzitza b&#8221;peh. Some rabbis recommended discontinuing the practice. Notably, the Chasam Sofer and R&#8217; Hirsch tried to urge their communities to use a glass tube to create the suction instead of direct contact with the mouth.</p>
<p>Others pushed back. For example, the Maharam Schick elevated metzitzah b&#8217;peh to halacha l&#8217;Moshe m&#8217;Sinai status. This was to make it unimpeachable. It was also the first mention of this halacha l&#8217;Moshe m&#8217;Sinai in recorded history (I believe). The issue was far from settled, even in the 19th century.</p>
<p>The controversy arose again when several babies were diagnosed with a virus and it was presumed that the virus was contracted during metzitza b&#8217;peh. Since that time, many articles have battled over whether the babies were really infected because of metzitza b&#8217;peh or not. Other articles analyze whether or not the baby is actually placed into danger via metzitza b&#8217;peh or not. I am not qualified to have an opinion on this matter. To me, it is irrelevant. Everything we know about sickness and germs tells us that this is a bad idea from a medical standpoint. No one living in the West in 2012 could say with a straight face that placing one&#8217;s mouth over a fresh wound is a great idea. We will ignore this point of contention. It is not relevant for the purposes of this post.</p>
<p>Most recently, Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetsky was quoted in the The Jewish Week regarding this issue. According to them:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In a phone conversation with The Jewish Week, Rabbi Kamenetsky noted that in his community “as far as I know, they do metzitzah with a tube [a sterile pipette that prevents the mouth from directly touching the wound].”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>When asked about rabbis who believe that using a tube is not valid under Jewish law, Rabbi Kamenetsky replied, “Nobody holds like that.” Told of those who make this claim, the apparently incredulous rabbi said only, “I don’t think there’s a response to them.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The rabbi also expressed disbelief about those who would insist on the practice despite its links to the transmission of disease to infants.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Chas v’shalom [God forbid], if [children are] getting sick [from oral suction], [you] wouldn’t do it,” under Jewish law, he said.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Rabbi Kamenetsky also stated that because it is permissible to do the suctioning with a tube, which poses “no risk at all” to the infant, this should be the practice.</em></p>
<p>The reaction to this statement among the orthodox community was mostly positive. A survey of comments from the various Jewnews sites seems to indicate a respectful approach to this characterization of R&#8217; Shmuel&#8217;s opinion.</p>
<p>But then R&#8217; Shmuel &#8220;clarified&#8221; his remarks. And by clarified, we mean that he softened his stance significantly. The Jewsnews<strong>™</strong> sites reported that R&#8217; Shmuel certainly does not advocate banning metzitza b&#8217;peh. Rather, if a danger is established, a tube should be used. Further, no one holds that a tube is not &#8220;good enough&#8221; for metzitza b&#8217;peh.</p>
<p>Anger is being directed at the Jewish Week for misconstruing R&#8217; Shmuel&#8217;s statement. This is really silly because the two statements are entirely reconcilable. There is no reason to bash the Jewish Week for its take on R&#8217; Shmuel&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>But what is really going on here? Why do some people insist that metzitza b&#8217;peh is such an integral part of circumcision? Especially when it is clear that great rabbis have permitted the use of tube and in light of the fact that the entire point of metzitza is to promote healing as per ancient medicine? Why is this considered such a holy practice?</p>
<p>There are two answers (I think). One is reactionary, the other is ideological.</p>
<p>The reactionary approach views circumcision as a holy rite that has been mocked and banned more than several times throughout our history. The feeling is that even one step backward (really forward) from this ancient tradition places the entire thing in jeopardy. If circumcision is being attacked in any way, shape, or form, we must attack back. We fight for circumcision. Even when there is no real reason to fight.</p>
<p>I think this is a popular approach. Clearly it is based on a huge fallacy. But it is nonetheless understandable. Yet I think the real reason is the second reason.</p>
<p>The ideological approach is based on a mystical source. A 17th century kabbalist wrote that there is a kabbalistic reason for metzitza b&#8217;peh. The Talmud, which speaks of medical reasons, is trumped by the mystical source which speaks of kabbalistic reasons. The idea is that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8230;man possesses a foreskin because of Adam’s sin in the Garden of Eden.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The same parts of the body which caused this distortion must restore the body to its natural perfection. Adam’s hands took the forbidden fruit and his mouth ate it, so the hands of the mohel remove the foreskin and the blood is removed with the mouth. (Source: Rabbi Korobkin&#8217;s excellent article.)</em></p>
<p>I think this source is the real reason behind the entire kerkuffle. Like few other areas of Jewish law and practice, metzitza b&#8217;peh places the mystical and rationalist points of view at loggerheads.</p>
<p>According to the rationalist, the reason for metzitza b&#8217;peh is medical. There was no emphasis on using the mouth and our great rabbis are not to be blamed for their faulty science. There is no sacred meaning behind metzitza b&#8217;peh and therefore it can be pushed aside for a more modern solution that is equally acceptable in halacha. According to the mystic, the reason for metzitza b&#8217;peh is kabbalistic. Some <em>tikkun</em> is taking place when the mohel places his mouth on the circumcision wound and therefore it must be upheld at (almost) all costs. Perhaps our great rabbis of the Talmud were not speaking of some physical medicine when they said that metzitza b&#8217;peh was necessary for medical reasons, rather it is a spiritual cure for an esoteric flaw in humanity.</p>
<p>This is where we stand today. Mystics and Rationalists living under one roof. A house divided. Who will prevail? Is strength in numbers? Or is strength in reason? We will likely find out the answer to that question soon enough. In the meantime, I think it is prudent to see the sides of this battle for what they are, mysticism vs. rationalism. Again. I think.</p>

I saw it just after I wrote about the modern day exorcist here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/10/28/demons-dybbuks-devils-and-exorcism/" target="_blank">Demons, Dybbuks, Devils and Exorcism</a>. Buying this book was a smart decision. I read the book a little while back and neglected to do a review but I&#8217;ve wanted to tell you all about this book since I read it.</p>
<p>The author, J.H Chajes, is a professor at University of Haifa. He is a distant relative of the great Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Chajes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> is very scholarly and well researched. Yet, it reads like a novel, well almost like a novel, and it kept me engrossed in its content from start to finish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> chronicles the rise of recorded incidents of dybbuks and exorcism in the era of mystical writings of the Arizal&#8217;s students. Most of the book takes place in the 16th and 17th centuries. The book traces the relationship between Christian, Muslim and Jewish exorcism legends and practice as well. An appendix has full accounts of exorcisms found in rabbinic literature from that era.</p>
<p>As a skeptic, I found the restraint of Chajes astounding. It is almost as if he is winking the entire time that he is writing about demonic / disembodied soul possession. You just know that he can&#8217;t believe what he is writing as fact is even possible. But he writes as an objective 3rd party about rabbis and others performing exorcisms with a straight face.</p>
<p>There are a few points that I took away from the book that are worth sharing.<span id="more-4968"></span> First of all, the book mentions some disputes between rabbis. They were vicious disagreements. Accusations of philandering, abject immorality and horrible insults are hurled the way of one particular rabbi. I can only imagine what our rabbinic disputes will look like to historians some time in the future. Fascinating to read and fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>Second, the book supports the theory that &#8220;the more knowledge becomes accessible, the more some religious leaders will try to &#8216;esotericize&#8217; their religion to maintain a level of separation between the masses and the public&#8221;. I know, that theory is a mouthful. With regard to exorcism it works as follows. The masses were becoming more literate throughout the world. Exorcism was an art reserved for spiritual leaders and scholars. It was not available to the masses no matter how learned they became. Thus, the existence of demons and dybbuks reinforced the need for leadership. It is similar to today&#8217;s maximalist position of Daas Torah. In a time that more orthodox Jews can study the sources and responsa on a given subject, the religious leaders have reserved a segment of inaccessible knowledge under the maximalist position of Daas Torah. I&#8217;m not saying this is wrong or intentional, rather it is a pattern and it happens.</p>
<p>My third point for this review is the nature of the relationship between Jewish scholars and their Christian and Muslim counterparts. It seems that there was much interaction between them and they worked together, at least for the sake of exorcism. It was nice to see cooperation instead of the stereotypical debates and polemics against one another. If they could do it, so could we.</p>
<p>If you have ANY interest in dybbuks or demons or exorcism or 16th century mysticism, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/matisyahu_beardless.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4906" title="matisyahu_beardless" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/matisyahu_beardless.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This morning, Matisyahu shaved his beard.</p>
<p>Matisyahu, the self-proclaimed chasidic reggae pop-star, has always identified as an orthodox, chasidic Jew since his rise to stardom almost a decade ago. His signature look was that of a chasidic man. He had an untrimmed beard, long side locks and wore the chasidic garb. All of this while singing songs that made it on the pop charts.</p>
<p>Matisyahu explained his sudden departure from religiously inspired hirsute facial hair maintenance:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>No more Chassidic reggae superstar.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Sorry folks, all you get is me&#8230;no alias. When I started becoming religious 10 years ago it was a very natural and organic process. It was my choice. My journey to discover my roots and explore Jewish spirituality&#8211;not through books but through real life. At a certain point I felt the need to submit to a higher level of religiosity&#8230;to move away from my intuition and to accept an ultimate truth. I felt that in order to become a good person I needed rules&#8211;lots of them&#8211;or else I would somehow fall apart. I am reclaiming myself. Trusting my goodness and my divine mission.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Get ready for an amazing year filled with music of rebirth. And for those concerned with my naked face, don&#8217;t worry&#8230;you haven&#8217;t seen the last of my facial hair. &#8211; Matisyahu</em></p>
<p>Many people interpreted this as a departure from orthodox Judaism. They felt that this meant that Matisyahu was reverting to his pre-orthodox Jewish lifestyle and would no longer identify as an orthodox Jew. Heeb Magazine made this point in the most cynical way possible.<span id="more-4905"></span></p>
<p>After an Internet firestorm, Matisyahu clarified his newfound religious freedom with a more careful statement:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>For all of those who are being awesome, you are awesome. For all those who are confused: today I went to the Mikva and Shul just like yesterday.</em></p>
<p>So, it seems that all the bellyaching and nervous twitching over losing the one and only orthodox Jewish pop star and the first since my friend Evan from Evan and Jaron paved the way for Matisyahu, was premature and overly judgmental.</p>
<p>This leads me to two less than obvious thoughts. (I&#8217;ll save the obvious thoughts for the obvobloggers. You know who you are.)</p>
<p>First, Matisyahu must think that non-chasidic orthodox Judaism (NCOJ) has less rules than chasidic orthodox Judaism (COJ). This is not necessarily the truth. What is true is that COJ has more rules about appearance and external practices than NCOJ. Further, NCOJ is adopting more and more of the COJ appearances and rules on appearance.</p>
<p>By and large, I think this is a fair distinction. COJ glamorizes a certain mode of dress and appearance as holy. NCOJ also glamorizes a certain mode of dress and appearance as holy but it is less distinctive and less sharply enforced. So I hope Matisyahu is not too disappointed with NCOJ when it comes to appearances. That is, unless he will be self-identifying as Modern Orthodox or a Yekke. Those two groups are the least concerned with external appearances within the orthodox Jewish spectrum.</p>
<p>Second, the beard. To some, especially those in the COJ community, the beard is holy. It has religious significance. It is not to be touched by human hand, scissor, shaver, razor or garden shears. This idea is based on mystical teachings and kabbalah. This religiously inspired love for man-hair contributed to the shocking, but brief image of a religiously shattered Matisyahu. One blogger announced that he was &#8220;off the derech&#8221; because he had shaved.</p>
<p>When Matisyahu announced he had shaved, I was actually proud of him. To me, it meant that he was thinking critically about his Judaism and felt a beard was not necessary or integral to his love and service of God. I agree.</p>
<p>Beards in orthodox Judaism are a funny thing. They mean a lot to some people. But really they mean nothing at all. A beard does not make someone holy. A holy person does not need a beard to be complete. Let&#8217;s not forget that a beard is simply just that, a beard. The Torah prohibits destroying one&#8217;s facial hair. This law is similar to the law prohibiting cutting one&#8217;s self or getting a tattoo. Using a scissor or similar mechanism to trim or shave one&#8217;s beard is not a violation of law or the spirit of the law.</p>
<p>The emphasis placed on things of lesser importance is common in all forms of orthodox Judaism. It can be a harmful force if it causes us to lose sight of what truly is important. If Matisyahu can show non-Jews that being an orthodox Jew is a beautiful life let us hope he can also show orthodox Jews that even a beardless man can live a beautiful life as well.</p>

A recent movie called The Rite was based on the real life tales of a priest named Father Gary Thomas. Now Father Thomas is telling the world his experiences through the docudrama.</p>
<p>In Catholicism, exorcism is the process of removing the devil from one who has been possessed or attached by the devil. A priest who is trained in the ancient rite is brought in and removes the spirit from the victim.</p>
<p>Mystical Judaism has a similar phenomena called a dybbuk. A dybbuk is supposedly a dislocated fragment of a dead person&#8217;s soul that attaches itself to a living person. The dybbuk is removed by a Kabbalist.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a thought experiment: Would a priest be able to exorcise a dybbuk? Or can a kabbalist remove the devil from someone who is possessed?<span id="more-4743"></span></p>
<p>Either way, both exorcism and dybbuks are subject to much scrutiny and skepticism. Much of which is very similar.</p>
<p>Father Thomas describes one who possessed as people who exhibit</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;an aversion to the sacred, an inability to go to mass, &#8230;or Church, an inability to take the Sacraments. An inordinate strength a person doesn&#8217;t normally possess, knowledge of hidden things, speaking in a language that people have no previous competency in, also taking on the appearance of something that would look reptilian.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Hardly seems demonic. Well except for the whole reptilian thing. But I refuse to believe that. I am sure if it were true there would be <em>some </em>medical or scientific unanswered question about this phenomena. I have not found anything of the sort.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, very concerned people are asking the good priest how they can avoid being possessed.</p>
<p>Fascinatingly enough, the answer is that the devil only possesses people who invite the devil in or someone else could invite the demon in for you (that hardly seems fair). Protection for a Catholic is to live pure life, a faith life, a spiritual and a sacramental life. For non-Catholics it is to live a pure life, a moral life and a faith life. For non-Christians protection comes if you practice &#8220;something along the same lines&#8221;.</p>
<p>So it sounds like the devil is in cahoots with the Church and helps the priests by punishing people who don&#8217;t go to Church and don&#8217;t like going to Church. What a wonderful system. Classic &#8220;blame the victim&#8221;. It&#8217;s like when people are abused the traditionalists sometimes say &#8220;you must have wanted it&#8221;.</p>
<p>It seems so easy to be cynical about exorcism and demons but if we are to be cynical of this belief it behooves us to also analyze the mystical Jewish belief that feels so similar. Consider that.</p>
<p>But what is it that draws people to believe in these supernatural evil spirits? Why is it that the more we know about science, the more it seems like some religions push back and stress their less scientific beliefs?</p>
<p>This is a question I hope to answer in some future blog post. In the meantime, think about it.</p>
