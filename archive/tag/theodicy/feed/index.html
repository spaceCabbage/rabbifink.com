				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6650" alt="ap_newtown_sandy_hook_school_Sign_balloons_thg_121215_wg" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ap_newtown_sandy_hook_school_Sign_balloons_thg_121215_wg.jpg?resize=300%2C168" data-recalc-dims="1" />There are no words to properly describe the horror of last friday&#8217;s shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. I was a wreck the entire Friday. My job requires me to be strong and put on a good face over Shabbos. I did the best I could. My sermon was heavily influenced by my feelings about the tragedy. After Shabbos and on Sunday and Monday, it was still too hard to get through full sentences when reading or talking about the tragedy. It was impossible to watch the news.</p>
<p>I did talk a little about the tragedy on Facebook and tried to facilitate some discussion. But it was too hard to write about it in this space.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still hard, but less so at this point. That&#8217;s the blessing of our ability to forget. But it&#8217;s also a curse to be able forget if we don&#8217;t do what we can to prevent future tragedy.</p>
<p>I have a few things to say on the tragedy and they are not really related. So please excuse the unrelated points in this post.<span id="more-6649"></span></p>
<p><strong>I. Children</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible to read about parents losing their children in this senseless shooting and not be so thankful every day that our children (or your brothers and sisters, or your nieces and nephews) are safe. It makes us pause and reflect on how precious our children are to us. It makes us want to shower our children with love and keep them safe and happy. It makes us forget any <em>tzaar gidul banim </em>that we may have felt. All we want to do is reassure our children that they will be okay and that we will always be there for them. People mean it when they say &#8220;hug your children a little more&#8221; after a tragedy like this. I know I did.</p>
<p><strong>II. Mental Health</strong></p>
<p>We need better mental health awareness and care in this country. This area of medicine is always evolving and what we know now is so much more than what we knew years ago. We can do more than ever for people who need help. But unfortunately, there is a very negative stigma attached to those who need mental health care. We push people away from it as long as possible to avoid the stigma and then it can sometimes be too late to make a real difference. So while more care is important, it is even more important that those who need and receive care are not stigmatized.</p>
<p>A few hundred years ago we would have said that these people were possessed by the devil or a dybbuk. Now we know better. But we need to act differently and not see them as horrible people, rather they are people with challenges just like everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>III. Empathy</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge America faces as a society is that we do not share a common ancestry or ethnicity. It is also a huge blessing and makes America a beautiful melting pot. But because we are not as connected as people in other nations our sense of community suffers. People feel isolated. We live very manufactured lives. Most of us are not involved in the process of producing stuff, we just consume stuff. We are detached from our communities and neighbors. This has several harmful effects.</p>
<p>First, it means that if the neighbor&#8217;s kid is acting strange or we think he needs help, we don&#8217;t say anything. It&#8217;s not our business, we say. We are not comfortable poking into other people&#8217;s lives. Privacy is great and I think people should mind their own business. The problem is that &#8220;their own business&#8221; is so narrow that it only includes a very small number of people. I think it&#8217;s healthy when people are able to have relationships with others that change their business into your own business. If you think about it, my brother&#8217;s business is my business. That&#8217;s because we care about each other. We love each other. What he does matters to me. But I don&#8217;t feel that way about my neighbor. Certainly, some bounderies are necessary for a functioning society, but I think we need to care about each other more. When we think someone needs help, we need to have the courage to say something and we also need to have the courage to hear it and not lash out against those trying to help.</p>
<p>Second, it means that someone can get to the point that they are so isolated that they can shoot children and not care. A person who feels empathy and connects with others in their community does not kill people in that community. This is a general solution that could solve so much of our crime. People don&#8217;t harm people that they care about. We need to expand the group of people of whom we care about.</p>
<p>We need to figure out why mass shootings are a uniquely American phenomena. I think this might be part of the reason. Judaism very strongly promotes creating this kind of empathetic society. We need to do a better job amongst ourselves to play our role as a light unto the nations.</p>
<p><strong>IV. Guns</strong></p>
<p>I am<b> </b>not going to discuss arguments for or against increased gun control laws. It&#8217;s a very, very, very complicated issue and neither side of the debate has a viable solution.</p>
<p>However, I have a different observation. Let&#8217;s assume that increased or decreased gun control laws won&#8217;t significantly affect future mass shootings. There is still an argument to be made that some people don&#8217;t want to &#8220;live in a place that embraces / bans guns&#8221;. In other words, sometimes the law is not what makes the difference, it&#8217;s the principle of the law. Pro-gun people will say &#8220;I want to live in a place where citizens can have guns and have the right to defend themselves against violent crime&#8221;. Anti-gun people will say &#8220;I want to live in a place where gun ownership is taboo&#8221;.</p>
<p>But I think this argument is flawed. We should all want to live in a place where all kinds of people want to live. Isolating some or many of them is selfish. One will hear similar arguments about gay marriage. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care if people are gay. I just don&#8217;t want to live in a place that being gay is considered normal and a law that recognizes gay marriage does just that&#8221;. This argument is also abhorrent. We should all want to live in a place that gives every non-criminal or non-danger to society a comfortable place to exist. I feel the same way about this genre of argument regarding guns.</p>
<p>The only thing that I will say about the gun debate in our country is that it has become a very partisan issue and that precludes meaningful discussion. I don&#8217;t think there is any one event that would sway an ardent gun advocate to the other side of the debate, lest they change ideology and vice versa. More mass shootings turn into arguments for more guns and just as passionately against guns.</p>
<p>I will just say that owning a gun is a serious halachic issue, particularly if one has children in the home and must be discussed with a halachic authority or independently researched.</p>
<p><strong>V. Theodicy</strong></p>
<p>People will ask: How does God allow senseless murders? Why do tragedies like this happen?</p>
<p>There is only answer that is acceptable. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Any moron who says anything other than &#8220;we don&#8217;t know&#8221; needs to be stopped. Please.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CollegeGraduation.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4101" title="CollegeGraduation" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CollegeGraduation.jpg?resize=300%2C259" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I respect Dennis Prager. Often, I vehemently agree with him. Sometime I do not.</p>
<p>Last week I saw an article by Dennis Prager that I took issue with. But the topic has been <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/19/a-moral-argument-against-the-death-penalty/" target="_blank">already discussed on this blog</a> so I decided to let it go and not post a response. This week, another Dennis Prager article caught my attention. It also caught the attention of a writer at The Atlantic.</p>
<p>In an article on the National Review Online called, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/263877/why-god-isn-t-doing-well-dennis-prager" target="_blank">God Isn&#8217;t Doing Well</a>, Dennis Prager posits some interesting food for thought about the quality and quantity of belief in God and religion in America. According to Prager, God isn&#8217;t doing very well. I&#8217;m not sure where he gets that from, but he seems pretty sure about it. I don&#8217;t know if I agree with his assumption, but for the sake of this blog post we will assume he is right. Again, he might be completely wrong about that point. I just don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Prager blames the universities for the secularization of America. But not in the way I would have thought.<span id="more-4100"></span> He accuses the universities of a sneaky secular agenda that seeks to produce left-wing secularists. He proves this point by stating what I believe to be a fact, that the more education one receives, the more likely they are to hold secular and left wing views. I reject the idea that these two things are interchangeable. Secularism is different than liberalism. God can be doing just fine even if university graduates are becoming left wing. A victory for the left wing is not necessarily a loss for God. More on that later.</p>
<p>First, we will explore how and why university graduates become left wing and or lose their religion. Prager dismisses the straw man argument that he presents saying that University education makes people think more clearly, thus producing left-wingers, as false because of all the people he speaks to on the radio. They don&#8217;t seem very intelligent when they call his show, so the educational system cannot be producing intelligent clear thinkers. Again, I don&#8217;t think this is a very compelling argument. His sample size is obviously small. They are the people listening to him and of the listeners, they are the ones who call him, and of the ones who call him they are the ones he asks about their education. Certainly it is not a fair sample size to dismiss university education as producing clear thinkers. Be that as it may, I think he is wrong on far more egregious accounts. There is a much more reasonable explanation for college students losing their religion.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/04/why-college-students-are-losing-their-religion/236874/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a>, Conor Friedersdorf writes just what I was thinking. For most people, religion is social (or driven by parental pressure). Your family celebrates certain holidays, goes to a specific house of worship, you live in an area with like-minded people and your social circle is dominated by those people who celebrate the same holidays, attend the same houses of worship and share your beliefs. It is easy to be religious under those circumstances. So easy, that one can coast along without consideration for one&#8217;s beliefs. It almost seems impossible to believe anything else.</p>
<p>At college, those existing social ties are broken. The umbilical cord is cut. Young men and women meet hundreds and thousands of people who think differently, look different, act different and believe differently. For the first, time, many people are challenged in their beliefs. They wonder why they do X and their friends do Y and Z. They see the world as a collection of many possibilities instead of one absolute reality that was being confirmed by like minded people back home.</p>
<p>When that happens, people question their beliefs. They question why they were doing what they were doing. Sometimes they don&#8217;t have any good answers. Without answers, their beliefs will disappear.</p>
<p>Is that a secret secular academic agenda? I don&#8217;t think so. Is it inherently evil? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Friedersdorf addresses God and religion. I would like to add one more point to Friesendorf&#8217;s idea and address liberalism. When we live among like-minded people it is easy to forget that there are lots of folks who are different from us. Seeing and meeting people from other backgrounds and ethnicities can open one&#8217;s mind to the various challenges, social problems, biases and unfairness that those others deal with. If you become their friends it is only natural to become concerned with their well-being. Social equality and helping those with disadvantages is a cornerstone of left wing beliefs. It is much easier to ignore people who are facing inequalities when you don&#8217;t know them or even about them. But once they become part of one&#8217;s social network it is entirely normal to be drawn toward their cause.</p>
<p>Again, is this a secret secular academic agenda? I don&#8217;t think so. Is it inherently evil? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Further, residents of big cities, especially on the coasts, are also more likely to be left wing. Is there a secret secular agenda drug in the water? No. It is the same theory. When you meet people from diverse backgrounds, social, political and economic equality become a relevant issue for many people. This, I believe, migrates them towards the left.</p>
<p>Prager makes a few other points in his article that are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>He blames the clergy for being too soft on their congregants. All I can say is that orthodox Jewish clergy and teachers are very demanding and Jewish law does require built in models of respect and reverence for teachers. I believe these are good values. I am not sure if they are related to the issue of the article. But they are good values nevertheless.</p>
<p>Another reason Prager mentions in the article is the inability to deal with pain and suffering. Again, I am not sure that people are drawn away from God because of this, but he is right on target here about the failures at dealing with is. Theodicy has been a blunt tool for polemicists for ages and I think most people are uncomfortable with the idea that a man can know what God &#8220;intends&#8221; when disaster strikes. Pastors and rabbis are guilty of this and Prager is wrong when he says that the right wing elements of religions are better equipped to dealing with disaster than the more liberal sides. I don&#8217;t think either side is better equipped than the other. There are morons on both sides. Strident admonishments from televangelists about the wrath of God striking Haiti or Japan can&#8217;t be the solution that Prager is suggesting &#8220;works&#8221;. So I don&#8217;t quite know where he is going with this point.</p>
<p>Finally Prager blames the tepid response of liberal churches and synagogues to Islamic fundamentalism. I am not sure if the tepid response is to blame as much as the acts of cowardice and violence made in the name of God by radical Muslims. When people see the level of atrocity capable in the name of God, I believe, it is a turn off. Though I don&#8217;t know how much we need to have an &#8220;untepid&#8221; response as much as we need to reinforce the idea of our versions of God do not allow for such militant violence.</p>
<p>Returning to the substantive point in this post, we are all influenced by our environements. Rambam writes that people are drawn to the ideas of their surroundings. When the environment is closed and controlled, our beliefs are confirmed, unchallenged and easy to keep. This has advantages and disadvantages. When we venture out of our homes we encounter new ideas, new people and new challenges. How we deal with those ideas, people and challenges will determine the level of Godliness we integrate into our lives. It is our job to train ourselves and our children and our students to deal with the issues they will encounter.</p>
<p>I also believe it is important not to conflate political ideology and religious beliefs. There are plenty of left wing people who are religious and plenty of right wing people whose religious beliefs are flimsy or clearly erroneous. Politics and religion are meant to be two separate things. That&#8217;s the way the Torah system was in ancient Israel. The priests and the monarchs were from different families. And that&#8217;s the way it should be in America as well.</p>

<p>Since the Earthquake in Haiti many have attempted to figure out &#8220;why&#8221; the tragedy occurred.</p>
<p>There are 4 prominent versions going around the web right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/01/22/the-earth-trembles/" target="_blank">Rabbi Shafran Version 1</a>: God punished the people of Haiti because of evil speech.<br />

<a href="http://www.frumsatire.net/2010/02/03/presenting-rabbi-yehuda-levin/" target="_blank">Rabbi Levin</a>: The earthquake and Tsunami and 9/11 happened because of Gays in the military.<br />

<p>What has been missing from this is a more rational approach<span id="more-2094"></span> predicated on the teachings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Weinberg" target="_blank">Rav Yaakov Weinberg</a> Ztz&#8221;l Rosh Yeshiva of Ner Yisrael.</p>

<p>Gerald is driving through the desert. He gets lost and runs out of fuel. He gets out of the car to start walking to find a gas station. He wanders for a little while. Eventually he runs out of water. He dehydrates and eventually dies in the desert.</p>
<p>Why did he die?</p>
<p>That is easy. He died because he ran out of water in a desert. The rules of nature that God created and recreates every moment dictate that when a man has no water in a desert he will dehydrate and probably die shortly thereafter. God does not bend or adjust the rules of nature to save him. Nor should God bend the rules of nature. The relationship God has with the world is that of a hidden God. God hides behind the mask of nature and does not show Himself.</p>
<p>There is a fault line the lies beneath Port Au Prince. <a href="http://www.haitixchange.com/index.php/hx/Articles/possibilty-of-earthquake-in-port-au-prince//" target="_blank">It was suggested by geologists in late 2008</a> that there could be a severe earthquake in Haiti as a result of this fault line. In January 2010 the plates along the fault line shifted. A massive earthquake ensued. Thousands of people died and many more were injured.</p>
<p>Why did they die?</p>
<p>That is also easy. They died because there was an earthquake. The rules of nature that God created and recreates at every moment dictate that when tectonic plates shift it can cause a massive earthquake. God does not bend or adjust the rules of nature to stop the earthquake. Nor should God bend the rules of nature. The relationship God has with the world is that of a hidden God. God hides behind the mask of nature and does not show Himself.</p>
<p>What about the stories in Chumash and Tanach (Old Testament) that report miracles to save individuals or groups of people?</p>
<p>Once in a while God does bend the rules of nature. This is rare and only happens in extreme circumstances. We call this a miracle. It is really a misnomer because everything is a miracle. Nature is a miracle just as much as the supernatural. But we only recognize or would recognize the supernatural miraculous. Miracles can happen, but we don&#8217;t rely on miracles nor do we expect miracles as part of the usual system and order of the universe. The universe follows the rules of nature that God created and recreates every moment.</p>
<p>What about the words of Chazal (Talmudic Rabbis) that blame natural disasters on sin?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t answer with certainty but there are a few options:</p>
<p>&#8211; For lack of scientific information they did not realize that earthquakes or other phenomena were &#8220;natural&#8221; and supposed they were supernatural events thus requiring a Divine reason.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were referring to a place and time where God did intervene on a constant basis.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were speaking polemically and urging Klal Yisrael to improve their ways and as a way of admonishing them they used exegesis to connect disaster with sin.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were misquoted or quoted out of context.</p>
<p>Then there is the Rambam. In hilchos Taanis, the Rambam states that when harm befalls the tzibur it incumbent upon klal yisrael to do teshuva and attribute the suffering the &#8220;way of the world&#8221; rather the bad things that happened were because of their evil sins.</p>
<p>This has been misquoted and misapplied in many instances. The Rambam is talking about a tragedy that happens to the tzibur. The tzibur refers to the Jewish community. So a harm among the a specific Jewish community is the time that we must attribute the harm to OUR sins.</p>
<p>What Rabbis Shafran Version 1, Feldman and Levin are doing is trying to use this Rambam in an instance of a tragedy that befell ANOTHER group of people. The earthquake was not a disaster that happened to the Jewish tzibur. It happened to another tzibur. Thus, the Rambam does not apply.</p>
<p>When would the Rambam apply? At most a tragedy that targets the tzibur. Most strictly constructed it would be when a harm is specific to the Jewish people.</p>
<p>So what are we supposed to do when tragedy strikes? When there is a Hurricane like Katrina, a Tsunami like there was in Southeast Asia or Earthquake like in Haiti?</p>
<p>We work on our compassion. We work on our empathy. We help as much as we can. We remember that life is fleeting and it can all end in a moment. We try to reenergize our relationships. We improve in our avodas Hashem. We find a way to use the tragedy to inspire us. It is personal.</p>
<p>For anyone to assume they know why this tragedy happened fails on three counts.</p>
<p>1) It did not happen to us. It happened to someone else. Do we believe in a God who punishes another party for OUR sins?</p>
<p>2) Maybe it did not happen for a reason? If it was natural then how are you going to apply some sin as the cause for nature? Do you blame sin every time a lion eats a gazelle in the African plain? How about when an innocent bystander is killed by a drunk driver? Did the bystander &#8220;deserve it&#8221;?</p>
<p>3) Even if it did happen for a reason, who are you to tell me why it happened? You think YOU know? Your puny little brain can figure out why God acts in the way He does? You know all the factors that go into &#8220;causing a natural disaster&#8221;? At best it is presumptuous at worst it is extreme arrogance bordering on apikorsus.</p>
<p>For anyone to guess why this happened fails on another count.</p>
<p>Nevuah (prophecy) ended thousands of years ago. A Navi (prophet) was like a spiritual doctor, one was able to see a Navi and ask why bad things were happening to you and the Navi could tell you why. The Navi was connected to God. That is over. It ended a long time ago. I am suspect of anyone claiming to know what God is &#8220;thinking&#8221; because they have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Trying to pretend like we know why the earthquake happened, even if we assume it happened for a reason, is wrong.</p>
<p>But at least Rabbi Shafran Version 2 and Rabbi Feldman are telling US to improve our lives in the wake of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Only one goofball has the gall to tell OTHER people how to act in response to the tragedy. Only Levin has the audacity to tell the Government of the USA that it&#8217;s &#8220;their fault&#8221; this happened. Only Levin completely abrogates himself and places the blame on something that is external to him and his group.</p>
<p>It is akin to telling a grieving mother that her son who was run over by a car was run over because the lady across the street had an affair. Ridiculous. Irresponsible. Self-righteous. Idiotic. Moronic. (Help me out here… I am sure there are more words…)</p>
<p>In summary, there are varying levels of what I believe to be errors in the wake of this tragedy. The least egregious is trying to figure what the precise message of the earthquake is. The most egregious is telling a 3rd party that they caused the tragedy of another.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/14/jewish-relief-efforts-for-haiti-earthquake-victims/" target="_blank">My view, as I stated just after the earthquake</a>, and the view of my Rebbeim is that the tragedy was a natural disaster. There was no malicious intent or direct message being sent to the people of Haiti or anyone else for that matter. However, it is useful for us to use the incident as inspiration to improve our lives and live each moment we are fortunate to be alive as a way of making the world a better place.</p>
<p><em>Postscript: A worthwhile read is <a href="http://rabbidmk.posterous.com/how-can-g-d-allow-natural-disasters" target="_blank">Rabbi Dov Kramer&#8217;s approach</a> which is very similar to what is written here just comes from a different direction.</em></p>
