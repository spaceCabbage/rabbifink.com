				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>I was invited to join Rabbi Shafran to talk about recent comments by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks and the subsequent response by the Agudah. We discussed it on Facebook on Friday and I guess Zev or one of his producers saw the comment thread and decided to ask me onto the show. The format of the show was to be a moderated discussion between Rabbi Shafran and me.<span id="more-7357"></span></p>
<p>Rabbi Shafran represented the Agudah position. I represented the non-Agudah position.<img class="size-medium wp-image-7358 alignright" alt="old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The gist of Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s argument was that Rabbi Sacks was criticizing a legitimate form of orthodox Judaism and was doing so from a place of ignorance as evidenced by his mention of the Siyum HaShas as an example of inward turning segregationism. Thus, the Agudah was standing up for themselves and the more insular communities who were criticized.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the Agudah over reacted. Rabbi Sacks was not even criticizing the insular communities as much as he was warning of a potential danger if the trend to the right continues. In his view, and in mine, there is a lot of value in a version of Judaism that sympathizes with orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Judaism should be careful not to eliminate this soft center between non-orthodox Judaism and orthodox Judaism. While the choice of the Siyum HaShas was unfortunate, I don&#8217;t think it accurately reflected his sentiments.</p>
<p>Regardless of what Rabbi Sacks meant, this is an important discussion and I invited Rabbi Shafran and the radio audience to have that discussion. While it is entertaining to argue about what Rabbi Sacks was trying to say, it is far less important than the substance his point.</p>
<p>Listen to the show below. I&#8217;ve cut the 2 hour show into 1:20 of just talking. So no ads or news will disturb your listening. The quality of the recording is pretty brutal but this was what I received from the producer.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7081" alt="91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_-230x300.jpg" width="230" height="300" /></a>Over the weekend it was reported that a teacher in an orthodox Jewish school in Seattle has been charged with molesting two six year old girls in his class. It is suspected that this fellow molested more than just the two girls but he is only charged with molesting the two girls.</p>
<p>Sex abuse happens everywhere. It is no indictment of a school, community, or family if sex abuse occurs. The test is how sex abuse is dealt with. The most important question is whether the victim is able to articulate that they have been abused and that the victim has a safe place to talk about the abuse. If no one comes forward there is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>It takes great courage to come forward. But more importantly, it takes education to come forward. Our best defense against abuse is quite simply our children. If they are equipped with the tools necessary to prevent molestation and report it when it happens we have our first two lines of defense in place.</p>
<p>The prosecutor in the case in Seattle attributes the girls&#8217; willingness to come forward and their ability to articulate what happened to a book that is the brainchild of Rabbi Yakov Horowitz, written by Bracha Goetz and illustrated by Tova Leff. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a>. Incredibly, it took years for this book to see the light of day. But now it is endorsed by leading Torah authorities and it must be in every home and every school.</p>
<p><span id="more-7080"></span></p>
<p>In a sensitive way, the book gives children the tools to prevent abuse. When the book was released, I bought several copies of the book for my home and anywhere else I thought it necessary.</p>
<p>Just consider for a moment how incredible it is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> helped end a cycle of abuse in Seattle. It could do the same in your community. Get the book.</p>
<p>In places where abuse is not reported and not even acknowledged there is too much space for predators to wreak havoc. It is a matter of <em>sakanas nefashos, </em>we must act now. Our children must be educated. There are no excuses. We must educate our most insular communities on the harms of abuse and help them help themselves get out from under the cycle of abuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> is so versatile that it is not only a book that prevents abuse. The book also keeps children safe generally. Rabbi Horowitz shared with me a letter that he received from a learning disabled child thanking him for the book as it helped him in several situations. The letter is so sweet and innocent, it brought tears to my eyes. It is time for us to take this challenge and grab it by the horns. The first step is buying and using this book.</p>
<p>Aside from the book, Rabbi Horowitz has an excellent video on keeping our children safe. Watch that here: <a href="http://youtu.be/LWQHaInsCGk" target="_blank">YouTube</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/AzQUwt7CEAA-lB_.jpg-large.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6097" title="AzQUwt7CEAA-lB_.jpg-large" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/AzQUwt7CEAA-lB_.jpg-large-300x225.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The Twelfth Siyum HaShas was the most incredible event I have ever had the privilege of attending. The Siyum was almost perfect and I am considered a critic.</p>
<p>All kinds of orthodox Jews were there. Some were dressed in chasidic garb, others in yeshivish garb, many in professional attire, some in casual wear, others in business casual styles. Every kind of hat and yarmulka was represented. I saw them all with my own eyes. At one point everyone in the stadium was dancing and you could see circles of as diverse a group of orthodox Jews one could find. Truly, the Torah is the great equalizer and celebrating a Siyum HaShas brought (almost) all of us together.</p>
<p>Agudath Israel of America put on a spectacular show and I was greatly impressed by their production. The Siyum was as professional event I have ever attended. The speakers mostly spoke beautifully. The video tributes were slick and very well done. The music was excellent. The programs were lovely. The overall attitude and atmosphere of the Siyum was positive and filled with joy.</p>
<p>That is the way it is done. Wow.<span id="more-6096"></span></p>
<p>I want to mention a few particular specifics that made an impact on me.</p>
<p>First, the wow moment. I, like so many others, arrived late. But it was to my benefit that I arrived late. The stadium was probably 95% full when I got there and when I emerged from the tunnel to the stands, the experience of popping my head into a stadium filled to the brim with my brothers and sisters took my breath away. It was awe-inspiring. That moment brought tears to my eyes. That was before I heard a single word of Torah or a single bar of music.</p>
<p>Second, the primary speakers were outstanding. Rabbi Frand took the house down. He spoke eloquently, powerfully, and passionately. His message was that the Daf has a special power to urge us to do more and try harder in our Avodas Hashem. He ended with a great line: &#8220;Beyond your reach is within your grasp&#8221;. We can do more than we think we can do and the Daf pushes us in the right way. I was proud to share yeshiva allegiances with Rabbi Frand. It was a great moment for Ner Israel.</p>
<p>The surprise of the night for me was Rav Scheiner. I had very little prior experience with Rav Scheiner. Apparently he and my grandfather were best friends in yeshiva and he learned under my great-great grandfather from the other side, Reb Elya Lopian. Anyway, Rav Scheiner was masterful. He is a gadol from Israel but was born in America. His English was perfect (yes, he spoke in English) and his messages were timeless. He took every possible opportunity to heap praise on Rabbi Frand. It was very impressive to see a 90 year old Gadol HaDor shower Rabbi Frand with so many effusive compliments. His charisma and charm burst through his words. His genuine care and love for others was able to be felt as he spoke. His main point was that we should all try to commit to starting the Daf and that we should strengthen ourselves in unity and also learn the laws of forbidden speech to promote good will and harmony in Klal Yisrael. He was great. I hope we hear more from him in the future. A lot more.</p>
<p>Rabbi Lau was as good as expected. One can only imagine the emotion that he must feel at events like these. Here is a man who survived the death camps at the age of eight years old. He probably never thought he would survive and certainly I cannot imagine he dreamed he would ever speak before nearly 100,000 people in a football stadium celebrating seven and half years of dedicated Talmud study for the twelfth time. But that is exactly what happened and Rabbi Lau, in his inimitable style, conveyed that message along with many others.</p>
<p>Third, the video presentations were so politically correct, inclusive, and diverse. They were each very professionally produced and they did not feel amateur at all. These were super high quality videos. The attention to detail, their moments, and their universality were really very appreciated. The two gentlemen who proclaimed that they had finished Shas 5 and 6 times in the tribute to the teachers of the Daf were both from the modern Orthodox community. This willingness to step outside the yeshivaworld box made the videos even better than they would have been if they were more monolithic.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to make two observations.</p>
<p>First, I want to compare the Siyum to the Asifa. It is so much more inspirational when one stands <em>for something</em> as opposed to standing <em>against something.</em> The Siyum stands for Torah and for unity. The Asifa stood against the Internet. The impact of the Siyum, which did not ban or prohibit anything, was in my opinion several times more than the positive impact of the Asifa. You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar. The speakers spoke with smiles on their faces. The atmosphere was so positive and so optimistic that I have to believe the Siyum was very inspirational for many people. Part of the reason for that was the good attitude and pleasant spirit of the event.</p>
<p>This point could be demonstrated by comparing two statements. At the Asifa, &#8220;R’ Wachsman said that since all of Klal Yisrael is gathering together for an event, notwithstanding the fact that only a small sliver of the Jewish population was present at the Asifa, whatever edicts were initiated at the event would be binding on all Jews and if someone was not present at the Asifa, they were bound as well. Anyone who would not listen to the edicts was to be considered a defector and would lose their portion in the next world.&#8221; (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/20/the-asifa-is-done-i-was-fooled/">The Asifa is Done: I Was Fooled</a>)</p>
<p>At the Siyum, Rav Scheiner said we should take the inspiration of the evening and as Rabbi Frand suggested, we make a plan. Rav Scheiner&#8217;s suggested plan for us was that we should all try to learn a daf a day and join the Daf Yomi movement and study the writings of the Chofetz Chaim. But he emphasized several times that we should say &#8220;Bli Neder&#8221;. We shouldn&#8217;t obligate ourselves with a promise, we should just try our best.</p>
<p>Do you see the difference? I do. It&#8217;s a big difference.</p>
<p>Second, I want to talk about Agudah. The Siyum HaShas is an Agudah production. I cannot tell you how incredibly the Siyum was produced. There were very modern multimedia presentations, there was music, there were intellectually stimulating speeches, there was very little &#8220;mussar&#8221;, and zero negative energy. The Siyum used the past for perspective but focused mostly on the future. There seemed to be a concerted effort to use technology and present orthodox Judaism as modern and appealing. I give Agudah all the credit in the world for creating such a wonderful Siyum atmosphere.</p>
<p>But then I think of the Agudah Convention and I can&#8217;t help but think that it is almost impossible to believe that the two events are run by the same organization! At the conventions, orthodoxy is very narrow and the focus is on tradition and the past.  The Agudah Conventions do not resemble the Siyum at all! In fact the Siyum was so good that it might even outweigh the 7 years of Agudah Conventions between Siyums.</p>
<p>So there are two options here. Either Agudah will use this Siyum as a foundation for the future. They will embrace modernity to a certain degree and present a contemporary version of traditional orthodoxy and the convention will being to resemble the Siyum in attitude and production. Or the Siyum was an anomaly and the convention will be the same ol&#8217;, same ol&#8217;. I really, really hope it is the former. I want Agudah to be successful. I want Agudah to be relevant. I want Agudah to be the somewhat progressive, but traditionally orthodox organization it was when my grandfather was involved in the Agudah in the 50&#8242;s and 60&#8242;s. The Siyum style Agudah can be that organization. Hopefully, they will be that organization in the future.</p>
<p>The Siyum was absolutely amazing. I know I am inspired after being there. I know my son had a very special experience at the Siyum as well. I could not have asked for a better Siyum experience. Thank you Agudath Isreal of America. Next time <a href="daf.finkorswim.com" target="_blank">I hope to be making a Siyum along with the rest of the Daf Yomi</a> learners. And I hope you will too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mysiyum-stadium.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6089" title="mysiyum-stadium" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/mysiyum-stadium-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" /></a>The 12th Siyum HaShas will take place on August 1, 2012. The event is a massive spectacle and the orthodox Jewish community is on display. The Olympics come every 4 years. The Siyum HaShas comes around once every 7 and half years. This is a huge opportunity for positive Jewish media coverage and a chance to inspire the world.</p>
<p>Agudath Israel of America does an excellent job preparing and managing the siyum. It is easy to quibble or complain about a project of this magnitude, but overall they do a really good job.</p>
<p>Rabbis Frand and Lau are the featured speakers and they are excellent choices. These keynote speakers are moderates. That just means that the right wingers think they are too left wing and the left wingers think they are too right wing. In my opinion that is a good decision as opposed to trying to find one representative from each micro-subsection of orthodox Judaism.<span id="more-6087"></span></p>
<p>One only need look to the cornucopia of Siyum HaShas&#8217; in Israel to see how difficult Agudah&#8217;s job is and that they have been by and large successful. In Israel there are many, many siyums and most of them are sect-centric. Meaning, the attendees are mostly monolithic and &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t dare go to the other siyums&#8221;. (See the article in Haaretz linked below.) The plain fact is that in America almost all orthodox Jews go to one siyum or they join is via a satellite siyum. But it is all in the spirit of unity.</p>
<p>This is the greatest feature of Daf Yomi. The beauty of Daf Yomi is that wherever one goes, there are Jews studying the same part of the Talmud. The Torah is our most important asset as a people and Daf Yomi assists the Torah as a unifying banner under which we all pledge allegiance. It is fitting that the siyum be almost as universal as possible, bringing together the best feature of Daf Yomi and the beauty of Torah.</p>
<p>I am proud to be attending my third Siyum HaShas. One of my grandfathers took me when I was 9 years old to the siyum and my other grandfather met us there and bought me my first Gemara. Seven and a half years later I attended my second siyum with my grandfather. I was unable to attend the next siyum, but this year I will be attending. More importantly, my nine year old son will be attending his first siyum as well. My father, his grandfather, will be taking him and his other grandfather will be there as well. It comes full circle.</p>
<p>This really represents what the siyum is all about. Torah is transmitted from father to son and sometimes from grandfather to grandson as well. The siyum is not just a celebration for the dedicated daf yomi participants. It is also a monument of our dedication to Torah and Torah study. The sheer numbers of participants and the diversity of the participants is inspiring and gives us all hope for our future.</p>
<p>Many people are inspired to attempt to join daf yomi with the start of a new cycle. The siyum, a celebration of completion, somehow inspires people to redouble their efforts toward their own Talmud study. I too am inspired by the siyum and the multitude of people celebrating their personal seven and a half year journey at the siyum. I am inspired by praying with 90,000 people in one venue. I am inspired by the everyday people who have taken part in this cosmic adventure. I look forward to being present at the siyum. I look forward to celebrating with the thousands of people finishing the entire Talmud for the first or for the fiftieth time.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Agudah for doing their best to keep the celebration as universal as possible. To those who are boycotting the siyum I say, you are on the wrong side of this issue. Torah unifies us and if we are unable to come together to celebrate Torah, there is a very deep problem with your approach to Torah and Judaism. We need to unite over things we agree upon, not look with a magnifying glass to find things we disagree upon.</p>
<p>The siyum will be glorious and the people it inspires will make it worth it and then some. Let&#8217;s come together and savor this wonderful moment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/gay-marriage-rights.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5686" title="gay-marriage-rights" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/gay-marriage-rights-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>The OU, RCA, and Agudath Israel of America have recently issued public statements expressing their dismay as the movement to grant same sex couples marriage rights gains momentum. Similarly, the OU and Agudath Israel of America issued a statement expressing their displeasure with the now famous contraceptive mandate in Obamacare.</p>
<p>While the two statements are similar, they are also very different. The Torah prohibits a specific kind of male on male lovemaking. The Torah does not recognize, or even provide a mechanism for two men or two women to wed in a religious ceremony. Legalizing same sex marriage is seen as an affront to these values. However, the Torah does not prohibit contraception. Yet, the orthodox Jewish organizations rallied together to support the Catholic Church which does prohibit contraceptive use for its membership.</p>
<p>The most reasonable explanation for these statements is that the orthodox Jewish organizations fear that if legislation is passed that is not consistent with the values of orthodox Judaism, those who practice orthodox Judaism could be subject to discrimination lawsuits. This explains their support of the Catholic Church in the battle over birth control. Although the issue does not affect orthodox Jews per se, it does have a collateral effect in that it could set dangerous precedent for governmental interference with religious practices and beliefs which could give rise to discrimination claims against orthodox Jews.</p>
<p><span id="more-5685"></span></p>
<p><em>(That is, I dismiss any and all arguments that these laws are actually a specific risk for orthodox Jews or the spiritual health of the nation.)</em></p>
<p>As farfetched as this may sound, the Court of Appeals in New Mexico just ruled on a case of similar concern. A gay couple called a photographer to do their wedding. They told the photog that the wedding was between two men. The photog responded that she doesn&#8217;t do &#8220;non-traditional weddings&#8221;. They meet a few times anyway. The couple didn&#8217;t use the photog, obviously. They sued the photog under a New Mexico statute that bans any &#8220;public accommodation&#8221; from discriminating based on race, religion, sexual orientation, etc.</p>
<p>The reasoning of the gay couple plaintiffs was that they were being discriminated against by a business operating in public and this violated the statute. The court ruled in their favor and the court of appeals affirmed the lower court&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p>This sounds really, really scary for orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>Let me walk you off the ledge.</p>
<p>First of all, this is a very strange ruling. Using this interpretation of the statute, anything can be considered a public accommodation. Certainly City Hall is a public accommodation and in New Mexico, City Halls won&#8217;t give marriage licenses to gay couples! (Now City Hall is has immunity, but you get the idea &#8211; this is kind of a crazy ruling.) It is very likely that this ruling with reversed on appeal on this issue.</p>
<p>Second of all, it&#8217;s hard to see how this is true discrimination. There are plenty of photographers in New Mexico who would have loved to have the business. It&#8217;s not as if the couple had no options because of this photographer&#8217;s unwillingness to photograph a ceremony not recognized by their own state. Wouldn&#8217;t the gay couple want to reward and support photographers who endorse and approve their beliefs and choices?! Of course they would. So just hire one of those photogs. Problem avoided. If they can demonstrate that there is a conspiracy amongst photographers to withhold doing business with gay couples, it would be a much stronger case of discrimination.</p>
<p>Third of all, the photographer could have given a million different reasons for not taking the job. She could have said she is going on vacation or that she isn&#8217;t interested in working at that location or that she might not feel good that day or thats she has a funeral. Whatever. The point is that the only way a suit like this is possible, is in the precise situation at hand. That is, the defendant expressly says &#8220;I am not doing the job because you are gay&#8221;. It shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to avoid this in the future. So even if the Court of Appeals ruling stands, it has limited utility.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the lesson? The lesson is that this anti-discrimintory statute in New Mexico is vague and broad and may cause unfair results. But more importantly, states are writing these statutes. Instead of making general statements of disapproval that sound awfully like we are trying to impose our religion&#8217;s morality on America, an idea many orthodox Jews find abhorrent, it would be wiser to try and influence or impact future legislation to make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen in the future.</p>
<p>Gay marriage is already legal in New York and it will be legal everywhere eventually. Religious activists should engage in the legislative process to make sure that orthodox Jewish vendors and institutions are protected. Let&#8217;s spend our time and efforts on what will make the difference for our community. Let&#8217;s not waste time and energy fighting a losing battle. Same sex marriage is here to stay. There is no true sanctity of marriage in America. There might be sanctity of marriage within some religious groups, but that is not relevant to the issue at hand. Too many civil rights are attached to marriage to deny same sex couples those same opportunities without invoking religious beliefs. And as I am sure you know, one cannot use religious beliefs as the only basis for a law. So same sex marriage is going to happen everywhere. Let&#8217;s prepare ourselves for that reality by making certain that the statutes clearly allow for religious people to be able to choose with whom they do business so long as there are viable, vibrant options for the same sex couple.</p>
<p>But in the end, wouldn&#8217;t it be better if religious vendors were able to set aside their personal beliefs for the sake of civility and friendship? I mean, there is no prohibition that I am aware of in orthodox Judaism that would prevent a photographer from working a gay wedding. There is no problem for a tailor to hem a gown or cuff some pants for a gay wedding either. So I guess what I am saying is that while I respect religious beliefs very much, I don&#8217;t believe that one&#8217;s religious beliefs are sufficient cause to discriminate. To be clear, I am not talking about a member of the clergy performing a ceremony that does not even exist in his or her religion. I am referring to vendors who are uncomfortable working a gay ceremony. There is a difference. I don&#8217;t think anyone would expect a member of the clergy be required to perform a nonexistent ceremony. But there is no direct parallel to religious vendors.</p>
<p>It would make me much happier to see people find the good in others and respect their choices, than to use their beliefs as a tool for division. It would save a lot of time and grief as well.</p>
<p>So my suggestion to orthodox Jewish political activists is twofold. One, get involved in legislation to make sure our interests are protected and stop with the anti-gay platitudes. Two, encourage orthodox Jewish to consider setting aside their religious preferences for the sake of peace and maybe even kiddush Hashem (honestly, I am not sure about this one. But <em>eivah</em> certainly applies).</p>
<p>Hopefully, these ideas can bring us to a better future for all Americans. The religious, the gay, and the gay religious. All of us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/spartan-warriors-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5664" title="spartan-warriors-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/spartan-warriors-2-300x204.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></a>This weekend, Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel granted Mishpacha Magazine an interview. I presume that when a orthodox Jewish publication interviews an orthodox Jewish public figure, the idea is to give the public figure an opportunity to set the record straight on any ambiguous issues and paint the public figure in a positive light. This is what makes this interview so odd. It didn&#8217;t quite work out that way.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zwiebel briefly addressed what has become a cornerstone issue for most sane people, sex abuse in the orthodox Jewish community. The expressly stated position of the Agudath Israel of America on this matter was ostensibly formed by the Moetzes Gedolei Yisroel. These Torah giants have determined that an orthodox Jew who is told about abuse should speak with a rabbi who in turn will advise them if they should proceed to the police. There is no central list of qualified rabbis to address this hairy question. Unluckily, Rabbi Zwiebel is constantly in the extremely difficult position of defending this position.</p>
<p>Invariably, Rabbi Zwiebel changes the discussion from the policy to the bloggers, or the falsely accused, or the assault of Daas Torah to deflect the criticism. It&#8217;s a poor strategy and it is not working. A couple weeks ago, an Agudah employee asked his Twitter followers and Facebook friends, I fit both categories, what Agudah could do to change the negative public perception about their abuse policy. I responded that they should change the policy. They haven&#8217;t. The point is that Agudah is aware of the public backlash.</p>
<p>The Mishpacha interview was more of the same and it spawned two very strident posts by my two favorite bloggers, <a href="http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2012/06/agudah-acknowledges-dropping-ball-on.html" target="_blank">Rabbi Slifkin</a> and <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2012/06/zweibel-paraphrased-better-thousand.html" target="_blank">DovBear</a>.<span id="more-5663"></span> When strident posts like theirs are written, the apologists take to the airwaves. In their best attempt to mete out measure for measure, the apologists counter attack. They call those who dare question the authority of the great rabbis heretics, rabble-rousers, angry, no longer orthodox, and a litany of other offenses.</p>
<p>What strikes me is that the apologists often wind up championing positions or ideas that those they are defending would not agree with. In other words, the rabbis these people are defending tooth and nail don&#8217;t necessarily agree with their world wide web warriors.</p>
<p>I can attest to this. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/27/why-is-the-internet-asifa-at-citifield-for-men-only/" target="_blank">When I questioned the folly of disallowing women from attending the Asifa</a>, I was called all kinds of names. But the truth was that the rabbis who these name callers were defending actually agreed with my position. They wanted the women to attend. I can&#8217;t be a jerk or kofer for suggesting the very thing that the rabbis wanted. When I questioned the wisdom of a one-size-fits-all Internet solution I was lambasted. I subsequently discovered that several Gedolim agreed with that position as well. How can I be a horrible person for agreeing with some of the Gedolim?</p>
<p>I think a little of the same thing happens when people attack Rabbi Slifkin and DovBear. The apologists take more hardline positions than those who they are defending. They invoke crazy <em>svaros</em> and obscure statements from earlier rabbis, that the ones whom they are defending would never use. Their positions are always more nuanced than their apologists. The other side of the same coin is that the dissenters oftentimes understand the position they take issue with as more extreme than it was intended.</p>
<p>Apologists come in many shapes and forms representing many ideologies and positions. In politics I see the same thing. Politicians from either side of the aisle are much more willing to compromise than their constituents. It&#8217;s easy to be an extremist fundamentalist when you have no responsibility or consequences to your actions. But when the fate of others rests in your hands, and you are a good person, you are going to consider more than your most fundamentalist position. Public policy, whether it is religious or political is usually a combination of compromises. There are no true socialists and no true capitalists in government. They realize that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I think the apologists for the Gedolim need to take a deep breath and realize that the American Gedolim generally do not choose extremist positions. Similarly, most of the educators in our schools are not as extreme or unreasonable as the <em>parents</em> of the children in their schools. We cannot  allow the apologists and extremists to hijack or become the leaders of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>That being said, on the issue of abuse, the time has come for the Gedolim to really learn and appreciate what happens to victims of abuse. I honestly do not think they understand the gravity of the situation and perhaps if we educated them, their policy could change. If you would like to assist me or direct me in how to do this, please be in touch.</p>
<p>And for the record, my charedi poskim do not agree with the position of the Moetzes and they recommend going to the authorities.</p>

It&#8217;s too dangerous. He speaks his mind, is willing to challenge people, and he is very respected and beloved by the orthodox Jewish community.</p>
<p>Apparently, something got in the head of the Agudah Convention powers that be and they invited him to speak about the challenges some of our youth are going through in their lives. He speaks from experience, excellent instinct, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Two things to note:</p>
<p>Random clapping at the wrong times is cringeworthy but sadly humorous. You&#8217;ll notice what I am talking about.</p>
<p>The people who needed to hear this speech more than anybody else were not present. When the speech ends you can see the dais is empty. The rabbis in leadership positions needed to hear this speech more than anyone else. Maybe you can send then the youtube clip to watch on their shmutz phones.</p>
<p>Enjoy the speech. There is so much in there and almost all of it is right on the money. Please send this to as many people as you can:<span id="more-5445"></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/stop-sign.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4988" title="stop-sign" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/stop-sign-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" /></a>Thugs and hoodlums from extremist religious groups in Israel have been terrorizing fellow Jews for some time now. They have done so without fear of condemnation or retribution from the religiously adjacent charedi community. This recent wave of violence is not new nor is it shocking or surprising.</p>
<p>Spitting on young girls, calling women whores, forcing segregation at bus stops and on buses are all acts cut from the same cloth as the violence at Manny&#8217;s Bookshop and a political beating in Meah Shearim. We&#8217;ve known about this for a while. Nobody has said a word.</p>
<p>However, this time the media found out about it. So now it&#8217;s national and international news.</p>
<p>This has prompted responses and condemnations from rabbis, rabbinic authorities and lay people. That&#8217;s great. Finally. The problem is that these condemnations are so weak, hedged and long-winded that they, in my opinion, are a failure.</p>
<p>There is only one way to condemn violence and abuse towards women. That would be something like this:<span id="more-4987"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>We strongly condemn any and all violence towards women under any and all circumstances. Those who commit such acts of violence will feel the full effect and power of the religious and secular court system. They will be excommunicated from all religious circles and are heretofore to be considered persona non grata. If you know of any individuals who have abused anyone, whether verbally or physically notify the police and rabbinic leadership immediately.</strong></p>
<p>What we don&#8217;t need is an explanation of how these people are not &#8220;real charedim&#8221;. We don&#8217;t need poetry on the majesty of tznius. We don&#8217;t need snide remarks about the secular media. Just speak out against violence, promise retribution and to take action.</p>
<p>Enough with the apologetics and handwringing.</p>
<p><em>Feel free to copy and paste my version of an appropriate condemnation on all the blogs and news sites that have published the watered down condemnations to this point. If you can, please credit this blog. Thanks.</em></p>

<p>See: <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/05/04/agudath-israel-statement-on-magen-tzedek/">Agudath Israel statement on “Magen Tzedek”</a>. Of course Agudath Israel can&#8217;t post it on their own website because they don&#8217;t have one since the Internet is prohibited. Nonetheless they managed to leak the statement to the sinners who have blogs and news sites so that pretty much every single orthodox Jew will see the statement on the Internet. Ahhhh, the games we play&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, the statement makes a gross misrepresentation of Magen Tzedek, misunderstands its purpose, injects non-existent agendas into an otherwise somewhat worthy cause and as per usual, weakens the clout with which orthodox Jewish leaders have in the lives of orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>The statement makes the claim that Magen Tzedek seeks to redefine Kashrut and by implication, do away with the orthodox hechsher system. The effort is called a brazen one and its purpose is to undermine the religious tradition. The statement tells us to <em>&#8220;regard the new seal for what it is, a falsification of the Jewish religious heritage, and treat it accordingly.&#8221;<span id="more-4204"></span></em></p>
<p>I am embarrassed for them.</p>
<p>Hechsher Tzedek is not what Agudath Israel thinks it is. As I wrote way back when it was announced in December (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/12/16/kosher-supervision-and-ethics-supervision/">Kosher Supervision and Ethics Supervision</a>) the seal is supposed to run ALONGSIDE traditional hechsher symbols. The traditional symbol vouches for the kashrus of the food per halacha and the Hechsher Tzedek symbol vouches for the ethical concerns in mass food production.</p>
<p>It is NOT an attempt to undermine the mesorah. It is NOT a redefinition of kashrut and quite frankly, seems necessary in many instances to augment the failing oversight of the government in food production practices.</p>
<p>It has been argued that the new symbol would perhaps cause an unwitting kosher consumer to trust the hechsher Tzedek for the halachic kashrus and cause them to sin by eating food that is not in fact kosher, rather is ethically produced. In my opinion this is a ridiculous concern. No responsible kosher eating consumer buys food if there is a random kosher symbol printed on the label. All kosher consumers know that they need to vet any and all kosher symbils before relying on them. Hechsher Tzedek would be no different. There are already plenty of kosher symbols that are not relied upon by huge swaths of the Jewish community. I see no reason to be fearful that this particular symbol will cause sin.</p>
<p>I believe this statement was a mistake. The greater Jewish community would benefit from a Hechsher Tzedek alongside traditional kosher supervision. Agudath Israel is needlessly poking its head into a non-issue. By doing so they lose credibility and cause anguish and animosity among Jews for no reason. (And wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if Agudath Israel spoke with such gusto against sex abusers and orthodox Jewish criminals&#8230;?)</p>
<p>I hope Agudath Israel rethinks this statement.</p>
