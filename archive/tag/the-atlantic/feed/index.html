				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A fascinating long-form article in the Atlantic by Stuart Vyse grapples with the various aspects of magical belief. The headline is more misleading than most headlines, as it indicates that the article will be discussing how superstition works. It does not. Instead, we get a bunch of examples of superstition, which is nice, but not an answer to the question.</p>
<p>For me, biggest bombshell in the article was the extent to which the Reagan administration relied on pure superstition. It&#8217;s disconcerting that the leader of the free world was living his life and governing based on meaningless signs and astrology. See the article for more on this.</p>
<p>The problem I have with the article is that Vyse conflates superstition with ritual.<span id="more-7757"></span></p>
<p>Superstition is defined as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>1. An irrational belief that an object, action, or circumstance not logically related to a course of events influences its outcome.</em><br />
<em> 2. a. A belief, practice, or rite irrationally maintained by ignorance of the laws of nature or by faith in magic or chance. b. A fearful or abject state of mind resulting from such ignorance or irrationality. c. Idolatry.</em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kabbalah_red_string.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7759" alt="kabbalah_red_string" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kabbalah_red_string.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the examples in the article are unambiguously superstitious or pure magical thinking. Blowing on dice before a crapshoot, thinking the full moon affects behavior, or belief in premonition. But when we think of superstition we usually think of things like fear of Friday the 13th, or finding a horseshoe, or opening an umbrella indoors, or seeing black cats. These are events outside one&#8217;s control that one should not think are omens or that somehow these incidents portend good or bad news. That is classic superstition.</p>
<p>Many of the example in the article are not superstition as much as they are rituals. It is common to relieve anxiety by creating patterns of behavior. It calms us. It soothes us. So when the article mentions basketball players who do the same thing before they take a foul shot, it&#8217;s not that the ritual will magically affect the shot. Rather, the ritual relaxes the shooter and takes the person from a place of thinking about the shot to a place where the shot is part of a routine. This relieves nerves. Not magically though.</p>
<p>Or when college students wear a &#8220;lucky sweater&#8221; for an exam, it&#8217;s not because they think the sweater actually brings them luck. Rather, it&#8217;s soothing to have familiarity when one does unfamiliar things. It&#8217;s not magical thinking. I am sure there are some people who think their lucky sweater is actually a magical sweater. But for others, it&#8217;s just a way of using familiar objects and activities to find inner peace. That&#8217;s not magical thinking.</p>
<p>Religion can be both at times. Judaism has some pure superstitions as well. These are things that are not Divine commandments which people believe can change their luck or problems. Wearing a red string is perhaps the most famous of these examples.</p>
<p>Much of what all religions teach is magical. If one does not believe in God, then we would rightly call it all superstition. But there are many things within religion that are more ritual than superstition. Actions, movements, incantations, and the like that are not done for the sake of achieving a magical result. While it may be part of the religious belief that rituals will yield a magical result, the ritual has independent value. As the rabbis teach us in the name of Antignus Ish Socho who heard it from Shimon HaTzadik &#8220;Do not serve God like a servant who is trying to earn a prize.&#8221; We are instructed not to do Mitzvos for the magical reward. Their value comes in many forms. One of these forms is the benefit of ritual.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some people who think that none of the Mitzvahs make sense and we are doing them for the mystical benefit. However Maimonides and Rabbi Hirsch went to great lengths to demonstrate the ritualistic and humanistic benefits of Mitzvah observance.</p>
<p>Every commandment and sub-commandment has within it a ritualistic component that can enhance and improve our lives independent of supernatural effects and rewards. The version of Judaism that works best for me is the version that focuses on the ritual side of things as opposed to the magical. Following this path, we find that rituals have benefit even if one is struggling with core beliefs of Judaism. If one&#8217;s Judaism requires absolute belief in God in order to recognize any benefits to Mitzvah observance then if that foundational belief is not solid, the entire edifice comes crashing down. However, finding benefit and comfort and spirituality in the rituals themselves has a far greater chance of surviving a crisis of belief.</p>
<p>Science has shown that ritual even has the benefit improving the taste of one&#8217;s food. The little things that we do before we eat have been shown to enhance the flavor of what we are eating. (See: <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/rituals-make-our-food-more-flavorful/" target="_blank">NY Times</a>) It&#8217;s reasonable to assume that rituals have a similar effect in other areas of one&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s even possible that some superstitions navigate from magical to ritual over time. While we can scoff at the pure magical thinking of superstition, it is important to recognize the very real benefits of ritual.</p>
<p>Rituals can enhance our lives in a non-magical way. They provide comfort, they soothe us, they calm us, they make life taste better. No amount of magical thinking can all rituals to superstition.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A couple of weeks ago, The Atlantic ran an article written by the loving wife of a victim of childhood sexual abuse. The article is difficult to read yet doubly rewarding. First, the appreciation for the challenges abuse victims encounter and how they affect those who love them and second, the very sweet end of the article nearly outweighs the darkness of the rest of the article.</p>
<p>I have often (naively) said that if the <em>gedolim </em>would really understand the way abuse affects its victims, it they would really comprehend the trauma and horrors of abuse they would not hesitate to report abuse to the police.<span id="more-7615"></span> I&#8217;ve been told that the <em>gedolim </em>have been made aware of the severity of abuse and to no avail. This article would be part of that presentation that I naively think would change their minds on abuse. In a very direct and practical way, this article demonstrates just how deeply the victim of abuse feels their pain. Further, it illustrates how far reaching the trauma of abuse can be. It affects so many people beyond the initial victim.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7616" alt="discriminacion-mayorias-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/discriminacion-mayorias-2-600x424.jpg" /><br />
For that reason alone I recommend reading the article.</p>
<p>But there is so much more. In a large portion of the orthodox Jewish world, young men and women meet upon the approval of their parents. Mothers and fathers vet possible date prospects for their children. They rarely know these prospective mates personally. Rather, resumes are distributed and phone calls are placed to common friends and beyond. Parents are often overwhelmed with suggestions. It&#8217;s easy enough to eliminate the damaged goods before even embarking on a thorough investigation.But unfortunately there is a negative consequence to this kind of education in the orthodox Jewish community. Because victims of abuse are dealing with so much in their lives, they can be stigmatized and shunned as potential spouses.</p>
<p>Divorced parents? No thanks. Brother is no longer frum? No thanks. Sister didn&#8217;t go to seminary? No thanks. He&#8217;s in college? No way. She&#8217;s in law school? No thanks. Baal Teshuva? No thanks. At risk teen who figured things out at around 20 years old? No thanks.</p>
<p>Superficial details that have almost zero value in determining the true nature of the prospect can eliminate the prospect from contention very early on in the process. This results in a haves and have nots environment.</p>
<p>Organic dating avoids this issue. Boys meets girl, they get on well, they get to know each other, the develop feelings for one another, and then the superficial details emerge. By that time, very few sane people would toss out a relationship because his parents are divorced or she has a brother who is not frum. The relationship is more important than those petty details.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic dating has its own set of problems that the shidduch system can help avoid. I am not arguing in favor or against shidduch dating in this post. It&#8217;s just the reality of the shidduch scene that this is what happens.</p>
<p>According to my anecdotal, non-scientific research and basic reasoning skills, one of the greatest fears that frum abuse victims have is that they will be branded as damaged goods and find themselves at the bottom of the shidduch Totem pole. It is a legitimate fear. It&#8217;s stupid, but it is probably what would to happen. If parents hear a potential shidduch candidate was abused it makes sense within the misplaced priorities and confines of the shidduch system that they would just eliminate that person from consideration immediately.</p>
<p>By contrast, the first thing you learn about someone after meeting them is usually not whether they were abused. Obviously. In a good relationship, eventually it is likely to be disclosed and discovered and most probably dealt with together. So the abuse issue only arises once there is a couple with an existing relationship. If the abuse creates an unhealthy environment for a relationship that might doom the couple. But the information alone does not torpedo the relationship like it can within the shidduch system.</p>
<p>Thus, as much as we need to educate ourselves and our communities about the horrors of abuse, we also need to be careful not to allow ourselves to think that abuse victims are damaged goods who should be placed on the bottom of the deck when it comes to shidduchim. It&#8217;s a very difficult and narrow path to navigate but it is a necessary one. One solution to this problem might be jettisoning the shidduch system. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen. Instead, I think we will need to make a conscious effort to walk this tightrope. Let victims know that we empathize with their pain and their struggles. But we also are careful to make sure that victims know that we believe in them and in their ability to lead proud, confident, and successful lives. We all have challenges in life. Victims of abuse may have struggles that are more public than others, but we all have our struggles and no one group should have their struggles written off as inferior or that their struggles should automatically disqualify them from living orthodox Jewish life at its fullest.</p>
<p>For that matter, none of the superficial shidduch disqualifications make any sense. Let&#8217;s do away with all of them. But I think the abuse issue needs attention first because of how far behind we are in handling abuse and because suffering in silence compounds the trauma of abuse.</p>
<p>Please read the article and let&#8217;s start working together on the healing process, both individual and communal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/history-minor.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7144" alt="history-minor" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/history-minor-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a>Conor Friedersdorf has an excellent article on theatlantic.com called &#8220;<a href="ve/2013/05/history-is-beautiful-things-made-by-people-with-ugly-ideas/276328/" target="_blank">History Is Beautiful Things Made by People With Ugly Ideas</a>&#8220;. He argues that a graduate student who refuses to sing a song written by Walt Whitman because Whitman was a racist is wrong. The song itself is not racist however its composer said some very racists things in his life.</p>
<p>Friedersdorf writes that history is full of flawed men and women who did things that we would find abhorrent today. If we disregard their accomplishments because we are looking at them through modern glasses we lose all their contributions to society. Taking this idea to the extreme, it would be akin to not performing a surgery because the person who discovered or refined the technique was a racist or a bigot. We would lose almost all modern progress if the only people from whom we accepted their ideas or inventions were perfect people.</p>
<p>Instead we must view our forebears as products of a time where things were different than they are today. Even if it was the same world, modernity is built upon the ideas of flawed people.<span id="more-7143"></span></p>
<p>Reading this, I thought about how valuable this perspective of history can be to religions in general and Judaism in particular. The greatest contributors to Judaism over our history were incredible scholars and masters of the soul. They perfected their understanding of Torah and worked on their character to be saintly as they could be. In order to truly appreciate Torah, one must be a master over one&#8217;s spirit as well. Our Torah heroes accomplished all that and more.</p>
<p>But it would be foolish to think that anything that they thought must be flawless. They were not. It would be equally foolish to dismiss all of their contributions and accomplishments simply because of those flaws or mistakes. Ideas stand on their own. The ideas of our Judaism stand on the shoulders of giants. Just because those giants were not perfect does not mean that their ideas should be rejected.</p>
<p>However, if we, like the graduate student, expect flawlessness from our leaders we will be faced with two options. Either we can reinterpret everything they did and said to reflect our expectations of perfection or we will be forced to rid ourselves of all the incredible insights and contributions because we discover that they were not perfect.</p>
<p>I know which option makes the most sense to me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/conspiracy-theory-alert.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7112" alt="conspiracy-theory-alert" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/conspiracy-theory-alert-300x262.jpg" width="300" height="262" /></a>One would think that the Internet would be good for at least one thing. It should help debunk conspiracies. After all, all one needs to do is do a little Googling to find out if there are actual facts to support a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Compared with the pre-Internet dark ages, it would seem to be much easier to debunk conspiracies. But in fact the opposite is true. Conspiracies proliferate on the Internet. People find confirmation for their ideas on the Internet, no matter how crazy the ideas may be, and so the Internet provides more fuel to the fire of conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>The NY Times published an article trying to explain why rational people believe in conspiracies and what kind of people believe in conspiracies.</p>
<p>It seems that the primary factors of conspiracy theorists are cynicism about the world, cynicism about politics, low self-worth, and a feeling of powerlessness. In other words, believing in conspiracies may be a defense mechanism against these sorts of feelings. Correlation does not equal causation, obviously, but there is some reasoning behind this as well.</p>
<p>When people feel like they have little say in the world and they feel that the world is &#8220;out to get them&#8221; they can regain some semblance of control by claiming to have inside information and a broader understanding of what is happening in the world.<span id="more-7111"></span></p>
<p>Reacting to the news that a formerly chasidic woman lost custody of her children, many people see a conspiracy. They see a judge that is biased because she is bought by chasidic groups. Or they see a a judge who favors a religious home over a secular home. Or they see a judge who is afraid to stand up to a very powerful chasidic community. All of these things are possible. However, there are also legitimate reasons she lost custody.</p>
<p>Seeing things that may or may not be there to support an overarching narrative is conspiracy-like. It also fits in well with the typology of people who buy into a conspiracy. Many of the people buying into the conspiracy are ex-hasids who are cynical about the chasidic world (rightfully so!), may feel marginalized by that world (they are), and are certainly likely to feel powerless in that world. It&#8217;s empowering to have an overarching narrative to explain what happened.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that there is a conspiracy, but I don&#8217;t think it is supported by the facts that I read. I don&#8217;t begrudge anyone for trying to advocate on the mother&#8217;s behalf and I support those who do not want courts to include any religious considerations in custody proceedings. But I think there is a reason</p>
<p>I think this can also relate to people who buy into <em>segulos</em> and magical mystical mystery thinking. People who are cynical about the world because of anti-Semitism or theologically based xenophobia, who feel powerless because the world is &#8220;out to get them&#8221; or because there are dark forces that are making things difficult, are prime candidates to turn to solutions not based in reality. They will use &#8220;spiritual&#8221; cures for illness or everyday superstition or they turn to snake oil salesmen pitching salvation for the same reasons people believe in conspiracies. I think they are very similar.</p>
<p>In politics I think this bears out as well. <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/05/oklahoma-tornado-conspiracy-theories/65499/" target="_blank">People who think President Obama made the tornado</a> with a fancy weather maker to distract from current political scandals match some of these factors. They think Obama is out to get them. They think that they are doomed. They think they are powerless to stop Obama. So they turn to conspiracy theories to empower themselves as the ones who &#8220;get it&#8221;.</p>
<p>As we learn more about the brain we will learn more about why people think the way they do. We live in exciting times. Although, I am concerned that the NY Times is a conspiracy newspaper written by Jews to achieve world domination. You can read about it in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. (Just kidding!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/7-23-12-Munich-moment-of-silence_full_600.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5873 alignleft" title="7-23-12-Munich-moment-of-silence_full_600" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/7-23-12-Munich-moment-of-silence_full_600-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>A while back I wrote about the IOC&#8217;s decision not to have a moment of silence for the Israeli terror victims in Munich at the &#8217;72 games. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/18/there-will-not-be-a-moment-of-silence-for-the-victims-of-terrorism-at-the-munich-olympic-games/">There Will Not Be a Moment of Silence For the Victims of Terrorism at the Munich Olympic Games</a>) I disagreed with the decision, but I also challenged those who wished to have a moment of silence to garner support for their cause and pressure the IOC, not simply demand a moment of silence.</p>
<p>That is exactly what they did.</p>
<p>People like President Obama and other world leaders past and present supported the idea of a moment of silence at the Opening Ceremonies. This has been seen as a slap in the face to Israel and Jews worldwide. Add this insult to the BBC&#8217;s incredibly narrow idea of not calling Jerusalem the capital of Israel, it&#8217;s easy to feel like everyone is out to get us.<span id="more-5872"></span></p>
<p>I just want to point out that the IOC is commemorating the Munich Massacre with a moment of silence and the IOC chairman will be attending a memorial in September in Munich, and they already had a brief moment of silence at  moment of silence in the Olympic Village (see photo above for proof).</p>
<p>These things have either already happened or will happen. The <em>only</em> thing we won&#8217;t be getting is a moment of silence at the actual Opening Ceremony. Quite honestly, I understand the reluctance toward a moment of silence at an international spectacle like the Opening Ceremony. Like it or not, the moment of silence would be polarizing and you can be sure that some knuckleheads would ruin the moment by doing something inappropriate. It&#8217;s a matter of quality control. Further, I don&#8217;t know that the Opening Ceremony is an appropriate time to put the focus on one nation. It&#8217;s true that terrorism at the Olympics affects everyone, but a moment of silence for Israel&#8217;s terror victims does take the focus off the international community and place it on one particular nation. It&#8217;s just not the right time or place. Finally, 40 is a bit of an arbitrary number. I&#8217;m uncertain why on the 40th anniversary (more than 20, 36 or 48, or 60) it was necessary to make a huge issue over the moment of silence.</p>
<p>But thankfully, the IOC is doing several other things to remember the victims of this horrible act of terrorism. Plus, Bob Costas will be leading a moment of silence on his broadcast of the Games. All in all, the 40th anniversary of the Munich Massacre will not go unremembered or unnoticed. Let us hope and pray that the message is received by those who want the moment of silence and those who need to see a moment of silence observed.</p>

<p>I have NOT read the book. I have read the interview.</p>
<p>The book is a study of how and why religions became part of the human experience from the perspective of social evolution. The premise is that humans need religion and this spawned religion.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not a perspective that most religious people are going to be comfortable sharing. For religious people, religion came directly from God. Not because of a human need to create religion.</p>
<p>Although, reading the interview made me think about how religions view other contemporary religions to their own and religions that preceded their own. For example, what does Judaism / Christianity / Islam / Buddhism / Hinduism / Native American religions etc. say about how the &#8220;others&#8221; practice. If each religion claims it was revealed by God then what are all those other people doing? Did God give them other instructions? Or did <em>they</em> invent their religions while <em>yours</em> is correct? Where did those religions come from if God only revealed your religion?</p>
<p>Very interesting questions.<span id="more-4524"></span></p>
<p>As for Judaism, Maimonides has a comprehensive approach to explain the existence of religions prior to Abraham and how one served God before the revelation of the Torah.</p>
<p>Briefly, God revealed to Adam some basic commandments but of primary importance was to recognize the existence of a Singular, All Powerful Creator. A few individuals were able to maintain this level of observance. But most people corrupted it and began to focus their attention to things that they viewed as &#8220;powers&#8221; such as the sun, moon, wind etc. Instead of worshipping the Creator they worshipped these &#8220;powers&#8221;. Eventually this gave way to full blown pagan religions.</p>
<p>The only monotheistic religion was the small group of people who followed Adam&#8217;s teachings. Abraham was chosen as the man from whom would grow a people who would teach this system. Eventually this became the Jewish people who got a much more complete set of instructions at Sinai.</p>
<p>Christianity and Islam are clear and direct branches off the Judaism tree.</p>
<p>We are forced to say that other religions either evolved from the original pagans who did not accept the monotheism of Adam / Abraham or that they borrowed ideas from existing Adam / Abraham monotheism. As for their claims that God revealed their religion to them through a prophet and the instructions differ from ours, there are two points. First, there is certainly room for prophecy among non-Jews but it is unlikely that a pagan would be a prophet considering the qualifications. Further, if the prophet contradicted the Torah or the Abrahamic version of monotheism we would be forced to say the prophet is a fraud.</p>
<p>Being part of a global community of religions sometimes means that we need to admit that our traditions are mutually exclusive. I think it is important and worthwhile to analyze how we deal with questions about how other religions were formed. Each religion believes it is the right one. But they cannot ignore the fact that others exist.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the presence of such questions and analyzing their answers does not prove or disprove the validity of religion in general or a specific religion in question.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/prohibition.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4368" title="prohibition" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/prohibition-238x300.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="300" /></a>It&#8217;s been almost 40 years. Is that long enough for a war?</p>
<p>Whenever one begins a war one needs to consider the exit strategies. This was a fatal flaw in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe it is also a fatal flaw in the one war being fought on American soil: The War on Drugs.</p>
<p><span>It is hard to consider what was thought of as the end game of this war when it began. Was the end of the war going to be some utopian time where no one used drugs? Was it when all the drug users were in prison? How would winning this war look?</span></p>
<p>We can ponder those questions because we know with certainty what losing this war looks like.</p>
<p>I asked a public defender who works in felonies what percentage of their cases are small time drug charges (not drug king pin charges). Her response? 90%. 90%! Nine out of ten people being processed by our criminal justice system for serious crimes were busted for drugs.<span id="more-4367"></span></p>
<p>Felony drug charges can be filed for tiny amounts of drugs (like enough for a couple &#8220;highs&#8221;).</p>
<p><span>The prisons are bursting with drug criminals. It costs $40,000 a year to incarcerate someone for 1 year. 1 year! It costs untold amounts of money and energy to arrest, prosecute and defend these drug criminals. It is very easy for police to arrest drug users. They go to the neighborhood and &#8220;sell&#8221; drugs to addicts. Their partner arrests the users a moment later. They can arrest 100 people in a day like that. They go through the criminal justice system and weigh down the system.</span></p>
<p>The selective prosecution of immigrants and under-privileged drug users is horrifying. At frat parties across the country drugs are used with no consequence. The hobo who gets high goes to prison for a few months, years, decades even life. Three drug arrests and convictions can lead to life in prison (or more accurately death in prison). If someone who is undocumented gets picked up for a drug charge, even if the drug charge is dropped or fabricated they can be deported. Losing fathers, brothers, mothers and sisters to the drug war only increases the social problems in lower class neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks there has been an encouraging development, more and more news articles have appeared in the media calling for an end to the drug war.</p>
<p>First, The Guardian reported that world leaders were calling for an end to the international drug war. The names associated with the Global Commission on Drug Policy&#8217;s push come from all over the world. The problem exists internationally to the point that the US sends $1.4 billion in aid to Mexico and Central American nations to wage their drug wars at home. The commission is calling for decriminalization and legal regulation.</p>
<p>Then, in The Atlantic, I saw a great line from David Simon, creator of The Wire, which really told to story of the drug war to the people. The show is based on the real drug war in downtown Baltimore. It accurately portrays the many issues with the drug war. For some reason, Eric Holder asked for another season of The Wire. Simon said he would be happy to consider it if the administration was ready to reconsider its current stance on the drug war.</p>
<p>Next, President Jimmy Carter weighed in with his endorsement for ending the drug war. Citing the great work of the aforementioned international group, Carter turns the issue into a political one and talks about how great he was and how bad Reagan was. But there are some worthwhile points in his Op-Ed. For example, in California 11% of the budget goes to prisons and 7.5% goes to higher education. He calls on the American government to adopt the strategies of the Global Commission on Drug Policy.</p>
<p><span>Perhaps the most important factor is that Americans from all political ideologies can agree on this. Conservatives want to spend less money on drug enforcement. Liberals want to even the playing field for under-privileged folks and libertarians don&#8217;t want the government telling people what they can and cannot do.</span></p>
<p>We can all agree on this issue. Doesn&#8217;t it make sense to stop fighting about things we will never agree on for just a few minutes to end the War on Drugs? It seems to me that we can actually get some good work done if we would fix the things we agree about.</p>
<p>What should the drug policy be? Same as alcohol. Indoors only. Sold and taxed. Public intoxication or endangerment to others would be illegal.</p>
<p>What would happen? The courts would be less burdened. Our prisons would be mostly empty (and humane). The police and the citizens in their neighborhoods would have a less adversarial relationship due to less arrests and less fake drug sales. Police could return to more wholesome police work. Our local and federal government would have money to spend on much more important projects. We all win.</p>
<p>End this war.</p>

True empathy can be seen on one&#8217;s face. Pain, sadness, suffering, happiness, love and confidence are emotions that are worn on one&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it&#8217;s kind of a strange thing. Our emotions are in our brain. There are chemical reactions that determine the way our brains tell us we feel. Somehow those feelings translate into a universal language of facial expressions. Even if I cannot communicate via words with another, we can read each other&#8217;s facial expressions and at least have a general idea of how we are feeling.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful insight into this phenomena demonstrated by analyzing the hebrew word for face.<span id="more-4355"></span> The word used for face in the Torah is פנים (pronounced pah-neem). This word shares a root with the word בפנים (pronounced beef-neem). This word means &#8220;inside&#8221;. It is not a coincidence that these words share the same letters. The face gives clues as to what the person is feeling and thinking &#8220;inside&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is something that the video game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J5UQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217153&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B002I0J5UQ">L.A. Noire</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002I0J5UQ&amp;camp=217153&amp;creative=399349" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> tried to bring to its game. The game featured real facial expressions that reflect the thoughts and feelings of the actor. It was revolutionary and I might say, fairly succesful. The characters in the game seem more human and more emotive than any character in any other video game ever created. (See a demonstration here: <a href="http://kotaku.com/5802203/14-minutes-of-la-noires-unexpected-thrills" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>.)</p>
<p>The Atlantic has a fascinating slide show depicting LeBron James&#8217;s facial expressions during the NBA Finals. It is interesting because the criticism of LeBron&#8217;s performance in the Finals is about his heart, his determination, his confidence. These things can be measured on a person&#8217;s face.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CollegeGraduation.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4101" title="CollegeGraduation" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/CollegeGraduation-300x259.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="259" /></a>I respect Dennis Prager. Often, I vehemently agree with him. Sometime I do not.</p>
<p>Last week I saw an article by Dennis Prager that I took issue with. But the topic has been <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/19/a-moral-argument-against-the-death-penalty/" target="_blank">already discussed on this blog</a> so I decided to let it go and not post a response. This week, another Dennis Prager article caught my attention. It also caught the attention of a writer at The Atlantic.</p>
<p>In an article on the National Review Online called, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/263877/why-god-isn-t-doing-well-dennis-prager" target="_blank">God Isn&#8217;t Doing Well</a>, Dennis Prager posits some interesting food for thought about the quality and quantity of belief in God and religion in America. According to Prager, God isn&#8217;t doing very well. I&#8217;m not sure where he gets that from, but he seems pretty sure about it. I don&#8217;t know if I agree with his assumption, but for the sake of this blog post we will assume he is right. Again, he might be completely wrong about that point. I just don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Prager blames the universities for the secularization of America. But not in the way I would have thought.<span id="more-4100"></span> He accuses the universities of a sneaky secular agenda that seeks to produce left-wing secularists. He proves this point by stating what I believe to be a fact, that the more education one receives, the more likely they are to hold secular and left wing views. I reject the idea that these two things are interchangeable. Secularism is different than liberalism. God can be doing just fine even if university graduates are becoming left wing. A victory for the left wing is not necessarily a loss for God. More on that later.</p>
<p>First, we will explore how and why university graduates become left wing and or lose their religion. Prager dismisses the straw man argument that he presents saying that University education makes people think more clearly, thus producing left-wingers, as false because of all the people he speaks to on the radio. They don&#8217;t seem very intelligent when they call his show, so the educational system cannot be producing intelligent clear thinkers. Again, I don&#8217;t think this is a very compelling argument. His sample size is obviously small. They are the people listening to him and of the listeners, they are the ones who call him, and of the ones who call him they are the ones he asks about their education. Certainly it is not a fair sample size to dismiss university education as producing clear thinkers. Be that as it may, I think he is wrong on far more egregious accounts. There is a much more reasonable explanation for college students losing their religion.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/04/why-college-students-are-losing-their-religion/236874/" target="_blank">The Atlantic</a>, Conor Friedersdorf writes just what I was thinking. For most people, religion is social (or driven by parental pressure). Your family celebrates certain holidays, goes to a specific house of worship, you live in an area with like-minded people and your social circle is dominated by those people who celebrate the same holidays, attend the same houses of worship and share your beliefs. It is easy to be religious under those circumstances. So easy, that one can coast along without consideration for one&#8217;s beliefs. It almost seems impossible to believe anything else.</p>
<p>At college, those existing social ties are broken. The umbilical cord is cut. Young men and women meet hundreds and thousands of people who think differently, look different, act different and believe differently. For the first, time, many people are challenged in their beliefs. They wonder why they do X and their friends do Y and Z. They see the world as a collection of many possibilities instead of one absolute reality that was being confirmed by like minded people back home.</p>
<p>When that happens, people question their beliefs. They question why they were doing what they were doing. Sometimes they don&#8217;t have any good answers. Without answers, their beliefs will disappear.</p>
<p>Is that a secret secular academic agenda? I don&#8217;t think so. Is it inherently evil? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Friedersdorf addresses God and religion. I would like to add one more point to Friesendorf&#8217;s idea and address liberalism. When we live among like-minded people it is easy to forget that there are lots of folks who are different from us. Seeing and meeting people from other backgrounds and ethnicities can open one&#8217;s mind to the various challenges, social problems, biases and unfairness that those others deal with. If you become their friends it is only natural to become concerned with their well-being. Social equality and helping those with disadvantages is a cornerstone of left wing beliefs. It is much easier to ignore people who are facing inequalities when you don&#8217;t know them or even about them. But once they become part of one&#8217;s social network it is entirely normal to be drawn toward their cause.</p>
<p>Again, is this a secret secular academic agenda? I don&#8217;t think so. Is it inherently evil? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Further, residents of big cities, especially on the coasts, are also more likely to be left wing. Is there a secret secular agenda drug in the water? No. It is the same theory. When you meet people from diverse backgrounds, social, political and economic equality become a relevant issue for many people. This, I believe, migrates them towards the left.</p>
<p>Prager makes a few other points in his article that are worth mentioning.</p>
<p>He blames the clergy for being too soft on their congregants. All I can say is that orthodox Jewish clergy and teachers are very demanding and Jewish law does require built in models of respect and reverence for teachers. I believe these are good values. I am not sure if they are related to the issue of the article. But they are good values nevertheless.</p>
<p>Another reason Prager mentions in the article is the inability to deal with pain and suffering. Again, I am not sure that people are drawn away from God because of this, but he is right on target here about the failures at dealing with is. Theodicy has been a blunt tool for polemicists for ages and I think most people are uncomfortable with the idea that a man can know what God &#8220;intends&#8221; when disaster strikes. Pastors and rabbis are guilty of this and Prager is wrong when he says that the right wing elements of religions are better equipped to dealing with disaster than the more liberal sides. I don&#8217;t think either side is better equipped than the other. There are morons on both sides. Strident admonishments from televangelists about the wrath of God striking Haiti or Japan can&#8217;t be the solution that Prager is suggesting &#8220;works&#8221;. So I don&#8217;t quite know where he is going with this point.</p>
<p>Finally Prager blames the tepid response of liberal churches and synagogues to Islamic fundamentalism. I am not sure if the tepid response is to blame as much as the acts of cowardice and violence made in the name of God by radical Muslims. When people see the level of atrocity capable in the name of God, I believe, it is a turn off. Though I don&#8217;t know how much we need to have an &#8220;untepid&#8221; response as much as we need to reinforce the idea of our versions of God do not allow for such militant violence.</p>
<p>Returning to the substantive point in this post, we are all influenced by our environements. Rambam writes that people are drawn to the ideas of their surroundings. When the environment is closed and controlled, our beliefs are confirmed, unchallenged and easy to keep. This has advantages and disadvantages. When we venture out of our homes we encounter new ideas, new people and new challenges. How we deal with those ideas, people and challenges will determine the level of Godliness we integrate into our lives. It is our job to train ourselves and our children and our students to deal with the issues they will encounter.</p>
<p>I also believe it is important not to conflate political ideology and religious beliefs. There are plenty of left wing people who are religious and plenty of right wing people whose religious beliefs are flimsy or clearly erroneous. Politics and religion are meant to be two separate things. That&#8217;s the way the Torah system was in ancient Israel. The priests and the monarchs were from different families. And that&#8217;s the way it should be in America as well.</p>

<p>Everyone remembers the Malcolm Gladwell column about social media. It was the one where he said &#8220;the revolution will not be tweeted&#8221;. The basic premise is that revolutions need &#8220;strong ties&#8221; and the Internet does not create strong ties.</p>
<p>Everyone is also supposed to remember what I said about it at the time  <img src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" />  : <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/11/malcolm-gladwell-doesnt-use-twitter-or-facebook-but-he-is-pretty-sure-they-are-useless/">Malcolm Gladwell Doesn’t Use Twitter or Facebook But He Is Pretty Sure They Are Useless</a>.</p>
<p>Yet another luddite has weighed in on the issue as well. Frank Rich said this:<span id="more-3783"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The talking-head invocations of Twitter and Facebook instead take the form of implicit, simplistic Western chauvinism. How fabulous that two great American digital innovations can rescue the downtrodden, unwashed masses. That is indeed impressive if no one points out that, even in the case of the young and relatively wired populace of Egypt, only some 20 percent of those masses have Internet access.</em></p>
<p>The recent protests and revolutions in the middle east should serve as a good case study for whether Gladwell / Rich is right or wrong. I have supposed that the protests were organized and galvanized via the Internet and in particular Facebook and Twitter. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/02/01/the-future-is-now-or-coming-soon/">The Future is Now (or coming soon)</a>).</p>
<p>It turns out there is some data on all of this. Andrew Sullivan at the Atlantic has a some anecdotal evidence. (Theses quotes were compiled by Sullivan.) Here is what Facebook says about the revolution in Tunisia:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8230;several hundred thousand more users than it had ever had before in Tunisia, a country with a few more people than Michigan. Scaled up to the size to the U.S., the burst of activity was like adding 10 million users in a week. And the average time spent on the site more than doubled what it had been before.</em></p>
<p>Twitter helped also. From the NY Times Lede blog:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Less than two weeks ago, Slim Amamou, a Tunisian blogger and activist, was using his @slim404 Twitter feed to let friends know that the police had been to his house. Later the same day, after he was arrested, the 33-year-old computer programmer managed to turn his phone on and log on to Google Latitude to broadcast his location: inside the country’s feared ministry of the interior.</em></p>
<p>And on the role of the Internet and social media in general we have this from Slim Amamou, a Tunisian activist who is now part of their government:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In 2008, there were uprisings in Redeyef, similar to what happened in Sidibouzid. But back then it seems that the internet community did not reach a critical mass. And then at that time, Facebook got censored for a week or two. I don&#8217;t remember if it was related. But it was like a training for this revolution. People think that this revolution happened out of nowhere but we, on the Internet have been trying for years, together and all over the Arab world. The last campaign that mobilised people was for Khaled Said in Egypt, and we Tunisians participated. And you have to remember that Egyptians (and people all over the world) participated in the Tunisian revolution: they informed, they participated in </em><em>Anonymous </em><em>attacks and they even were the first to demonstrate for Sidibouzid in Cairo.</em></p>
<p>There is not much to add here. Sullivan did a good job making his point. It&#8217;s a point that I absolutely agree with.</p>
<p>Like anything, there is much good to social media. There is bad as well. It is a tool that can be wielded by the brave, courageous and honorable. It can also be used to hurt people, spread lies and inflict pain. There is no reason to fear social media. As usual we only need fear the idiots that use it to act like idiots.</p>

<p>Anyone who knows about technology, knows that the latest and greatest gadgets are all in Las Vegas right now for the consumer electronics show. The Atlantic is covering the show and found something they deemed newsworthy that is not directly related to &#8220;Consumer Electronics&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are chasidic Jews at the show.</p>
<p>Chasidic Judaism is often misdefined as &#8220;Ultra-Orthodox Judaism. It&#8217;s not. It is simply a way of life that focuses on the spirituality of the world and comes with a certain dress code. The men keep their beards, wear long coats and fur hats on holy days. But within chasidic Judaism, some are more &#8220;pious&#8221; than others. Being a chasidic Jew does not mean that one is more religious or more holy. It is a way of Jewish life that provides opportunities for religiousness or holiness, just like any other.</p>
<p><span id="more-3619"></span>At CES, the chasidic Jews are not developing new products. That would take an expertise that nearly all chasidic Jews do not have (ie heavy training in engineering and technology). Instead they are there as the classic Jewish middlemen. Using their connections and (hopefully) trustworthiness to develop relationships that can get them good prices on electronic goods and sell them to the marketplace at a fair price.</p>
<p>I think it is a common error to assume that chasidic Jews do not have regular jobs. True, there are scarcely any chasidic Jews who are professionals. College and secondary education are shunned. But nearly all chasidic Jews work. They are small business owners, they work in the services industry and they wheel and deal as middlemen.</p>
<p>I am proud that chasidic Jews are at CES. One of the men at the show was asked by the Atlantic if being chasidic impacts his business. He replied: <em>&#8220;People look at us as very honest people&#8221;</em>. That&#8217;s more important than any degree or faux religousness.</p>
<p>That is called making a kiddush Hashem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/kindleDX_graphite-thumb-640xauto-15142.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3524 alignleft" title="Kindle" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/kindleDX_graphite-thumb-640xauto-15142-286x300.jpg" alt="" width="286" height="300" /></a>The Atlantic used the headline I would have used in their title so I was stuck with a lame headline&#8230;</p>
<p>In an article, semi-appropriately named <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/people-of-the-e-book-observant-jews-struggle-with-sabbath-in-a-digital-age/68289/" target="_blank">People of the E-Book? Observant Jews Struggle With Sabbath in a Digital Age</a>, Uri Friedman contemplates the future of e-readers in the hands of orthodox Jews. It&#8217;s only a semi-appropriate headline because I don&#8217;t think many orthodox Jews are actually struggling with this issue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why this is an article worth writing. Orthodox Jews are a tiny segment of the population and do not participate in many rites of popular culture. For some reason, Friedman found this a subject worth writing on.</p>
<p>I have some comments on his article and some thoughts on e-readers as they pertain to orthodox Jews irrespective of the article.</p>
<p>First of all, I am impressed that Friedman knows that some prohibit electricity on Shabbos because of &#8220;boneh&#8221; (building), as you complete a circuit by &#8220;flipping the switch&#8221;. Nice job!<span id="more-3522"></span></p>
<p>The article also draws an interesting parallel between the proliferation of electronic devices and the move to the suburbs in the 50&#8242;s that resulted in a weakening of Shabbos commitment when conservative and reform Jews began driving to Shul in Shabbos.</p>
<p>But something really bothered me. Friedman does a nice job of including thoughts on the subject by orthodox, conservative and reform Jews. What was disturbing is what can be inferred from their quotes.</p>
<p>The first orthodox fellow believes that someone will invent a workaround solution. Since orthodox Jews are so desperate for an Shabbos e-reader someone will surely invent one. Similar to a timed light, the Shabbos e-reader would turn pages at regular intervals. This idea is insane and will never work. (Do I need to explain why this is dumb? Have you ever read a book?) There is no excuse for mentioning this in a respectable article.</p>
<p>The conservative rabbi in the article expresses reservations about using e-readers on Shabbos because they distract from the beauty of Shabbos. This is a noble idea. Unfortunately, most conservative Jews I know, watch TV on Shabbos. An e-reader is not less of a &#8220;distraction&#8221; than TV.</p>
<p>But here is the rub. The orthodox Jew looks like a halachic obsessive who is willing to break the &#8220;spirit of Shabbos&#8221; via an automated e-reader device. The conservative Jew is more concerned about the spiritual parts of Shabbos and even if e-readers are permissible would be sad if they distracted from the &#8220;spirit of Shabbos&#8221;.</p>
<p>I wish the article had not given this impression.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not really true. Orthodox Jews care about the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. That&#8217;s why orthodox Jews don&#8217;t leave their TVs on timers over Shabbos. Some orthodox Jews don&#8217;t use dish washers on timers for the same reason.</p>
<p>To portray the orthodox Jews as those who ignore the spirit of the law is unfair.</p>
<p>As to the issue raised in the article about e-readers and Shabbos. I have resisted buying an e-reader and e-books for a completely different reason.</p>
<p>Most of the books read in my home are from the library. They are free. We don&#8217;t pay $10 for books. Until there is an e-reader subscription where you can read all the books you want for a reasonable monthly fee I cannot imagine paying $200 to have the lucky fortune of buying books for $10 a piece. That is the real reason I am not buying an e-reader. It is true that I read a little more on Shabbos than other days but I read enough during the week that I would love to have an e-reader. I have a nice computer, a Wii, a PS3, an iPod, and iPhone and I only use those during the week too. Who cares?</p>
<p>E-readers are the future. But as long as there is a printing press and people own printers there is no <em>need</em> for orthodox Jews to compromise their commitment to halacha or the spirit of Shabbos.</p>
<p>However, if electricity becomes so ubiquitous that in order to avoid it on Shabbos, orthodox Jews would need to live like the Amish, it is possible that the halachic authorities will reconsider the original decision to consider use of electricity a violation of Shabbos. At that point anything is possible.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to experience a taste of Shabbos with no e-readers, come to the Shul on the Beach where we read from a handwritten Torah scroll and pray from old fashioned books.</p>

(<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/29/my-visit-with-judith-clark-at-bedford-hills-prison/">My Visit With Judith Clark at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility</a>) I have learned a lot about the failures of our current system of incarceration and it sickens me. As a (relatively) outspoken individual I have made my opinions known to anyone who will listen.</p>
<p>I tell them that I am against prison in principle. I don&#8217;t think anyone should go to prison. It&#8217;s a waste of money and far worse it is a waste of a human being. People accomplish almost nothing while incarcerated. Society gives them a free ride and they produce next to nothing for society.</p>
<p>The first response I hear is usually related to the safety of society. That somehow we, on the outside, are safer if the criminals are isolated, on the inside.<span id="more-2713"></span> While this is generally true, most crimes do not affect the middle or upper class of society . Most crimes are not violent. Most criminals that go to prison have someone step into their place in their social circle and the crimes continue. I know this is a pretty weak position, but I think that incarceration is also a weak position.</p>
<p>The next thing that I hear is almost always a challenge. &#8220;Do you have a better solution?&#8221; To which I have been saying &#8220;I think so&#8221;. Prisons are as an old insitution. They hearken back to a time that it was the only option for incapacitation. The loss to society caused by providing criminals with a prison was worthwhile because there was no other real option. Incarceration is a old system that was the best they could do.</p>
<p>I propose that criminals be monitored. Conviction of a crime is a waiver of one&#8217;s privacy. There is no privacy in jail. Instead of tossing them in a cell and monitoring that way, criminals should be monitored by corrections officers. They can be mother or fathers to their families. They must find jobs, they must be productive members of society and  only if they lapse back into crime would they go to jail.</p>
<p>To me, this was a sci-fi idea that I had no way of determining its effectiveness or cost. Monitoring was a idea, but just an idea with no real data to back up the idea.</p>
<p>Last week I read a very well written article in The Atlantic (I don&#8217;t regularly read The Atlantic, I saw the article linked on Gizmodo) about Monitoring.</p>
<p>It demonstrates the feasibility of the idea and its preference over incarcertation for all but the most dangerous criminals. It explains how badly the current system is failing and the attractiveness of this alternative solution.</p>
<p>I highly recommend the article and I highly recommend the system as described in the article.</p>
<p>Currently, it costs about $50,000 a YEAR to incarcerate a criminal in California. No wonder we have a budget crisis. Monitoring is a much cheaper solution. It is a more humane solution. It is a more productive solution. It is the solution of the future.</p>
<p>The only question that remains is how long will it take us to reach &#8220;the future&#8221;.</p>
<p>I say, the future is now.</p>
