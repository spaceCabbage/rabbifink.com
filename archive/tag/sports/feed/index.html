				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A fascinating long-form article in the Atlantic by Stuart Vyse grapples with the various aspects of magical belief. The headline is more misleading than most headlines, as it indicates that the article will be discussing how superstition works. It does not. Instead, we get a bunch of examples of superstition, which is nice, but not an answer to the question.</p>
<p>For me, biggest bombshell in the article was the extent to which the Reagan administration relied on pure superstition. It&#8217;s disconcerting that the leader of the free world was living his life and governing based on meaningless signs and astrology. See the article for more on this.</p>
<p>The problem I have with the article is that Vyse conflates superstition with ritual.<span id="more-7757"></span></p>
<p>Superstition is defined as:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>1. An irrational belief that an object, action, or circumstance not logically related to a course of events influences its outcome.</em><br />
<em> 2. a. A belief, practice, or rite irrationally maintained by ignorance of the laws of nature or by faith in magic or chance. b. A fearful or abject state of mind resulting from such ignorance or irrationality. c. Idolatry.</em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kabbalah_red_string.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7759" alt="kabbalah_red_string" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kabbalah_red_string.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the examples in the article are unambiguously superstitious or pure magical thinking. Blowing on dice before a crapshoot, thinking the full moon affects behavior, or belief in premonition. But when we think of superstition we usually think of things like fear of Friday the 13th, or finding a horseshoe, or opening an umbrella indoors, or seeing black cats. These are events outside one&#8217;s control that one should not think are omens or that somehow these incidents portend good or bad news. That is classic superstition.</p>
<p>Many of the example in the article are not superstition as much as they are rituals. It is common to relieve anxiety by creating patterns of behavior. It calms us. It soothes us. So when the article mentions basketball players who do the same thing before they take a foul shot, it&#8217;s not that the ritual will magically affect the shot. Rather, the ritual relaxes the shooter and takes the person from a place of thinking about the shot to a place where the shot is part of a routine. This relieves nerves. Not magically though.</p>
<p>Or when college students wear a &#8220;lucky sweater&#8221; for an exam, it&#8217;s not because they think the sweater actually brings them luck. Rather, it&#8217;s soothing to have familiarity when one does unfamiliar things. It&#8217;s not magical thinking. I am sure there are some people who think their lucky sweater is actually a magical sweater. But for others, it&#8217;s just a way of using familiar objects and activities to find inner peace. That&#8217;s not magical thinking.</p>
<p>Religion can be both at times. Judaism has some pure superstitions as well. These are things that are not Divine commandments which people believe can change their luck or problems. Wearing a red string is perhaps the most famous of these examples.</p>
<p>Much of what all religions teach is magical. If one does not believe in God, then we would rightly call it all superstition. But there are many things within religion that are more ritual than superstition. Actions, movements, incantations, and the like that are not done for the sake of achieving a magical result. While it may be part of the religious belief that rituals will yield a magical result, the ritual has independent value. As the rabbis teach us in the name of Antignus Ish Socho who heard it from Shimon HaTzadik &#8220;Do not serve God like a servant who is trying to earn a prize.&#8221; We are instructed not to do Mitzvos for the magical reward. Their value comes in many forms. One of these forms is the benefit of ritual.</p>
<p>Sure, there are some people who think that none of the Mitzvahs make sense and we are doing them for the mystical benefit. However Maimonides and Rabbi Hirsch went to great lengths to demonstrate the ritualistic and humanistic benefits of Mitzvah observance.</p>
<p>Every commandment and sub-commandment has within it a ritualistic component that can enhance and improve our lives independent of supernatural effects and rewards. The version of Judaism that works best for me is the version that focuses on the ritual side of things as opposed to the magical. Following this path, we find that rituals have benefit even if one is struggling with core beliefs of Judaism. If one&#8217;s Judaism requires absolute belief in God in order to recognize any benefits to Mitzvah observance then if that foundational belief is not solid, the entire edifice comes crashing down. However, finding benefit and comfort and spirituality in the rituals themselves has a far greater chance of surviving a crisis of belief.</p>
<p>Science has shown that ritual even has the benefit improving the taste of one&#8217;s food. The little things that we do before we eat have been shown to enhance the flavor of what we are eating. (See: <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/rituals-make-our-food-more-flavorful/" target="_blank">NY Times</a>) It&#8217;s reasonable to assume that rituals have a similar effect in other areas of one&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s even possible that some superstitions navigate from magical to ritual over time. While we can scoff at the pure magical thinking of superstition, it is important to recognize the very real benefits of ritual.</p>
<p>Rituals can enhance our lives in a non-magical way. They provide comfort, they soothe us, they calm us, they make life taste better. No amount of magical thinking can all rituals to superstition.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Last night the Red Sox and Yankees played the rubber match of their three game series at Fenway Park. Over the last 15 years these series&#8217; have meant a great deal to both teams as they battled for AL East supremacy and often enough for the best record in baseball.</p>
<p>These days, the stakes are not quite as high as the Yankees are no longer one of the best teams in the AL East. But there was some added drama to the weekend series despite the lower stakes.</p>
<p>Alex Rodriguez is in the midst of a huge controversy. What began as a simple performance enhancing drug use suspension has ballooned into a media and litigation circus. Arod has now been accused of ratting on teammates and others. He claims the Yankees are trying to smear him and ruin his career. It&#8217;s a very complicated mess.<span id="more-7463"></span></p>
<p>Some baseball people view PED use as enough to be banned from the game. But nearly all baseball people agree that snitching on a teammate is beyond the pale. Thus, the brotherhood of baseball players wished to exact revenge on Arod the nogoodnik.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7464" alt="081813-MLB-Yankees-Alex-Rodriguez-PI2-AA_20130818231449469_660_320" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/081813-MLB-Yankees-Alex-Rodriguez-PI2-AA_20130818231449469_660_320-600x290.jpg" /></p>
<p>Their salvation came from a pitcher on the Red Sox named Ryan Dempster. In his first at bat, Arod saw four pitches. The first went behind him. The second and third nearly hit him. The fourth hit him square in the back. To everyone in the world it was obvious what had just happened. Dempster deliberately hit Arod. The reasons were up for debate. Was it personal? Was it about PEDs? Was it about being a sideshow? Was it about being a snitch? Was it the combination of all of it. But no matter who you ask, everyone will agree that Dempster hit Arod on purpose.</p>
<p>In the end, Arod handled it with class and propelled the Yankees to victory. It&#8217;s an odd day when Arod is the good guy and the hero. But that&#8217;s what happened.</p>
<p>Beaning baseball players in a time honored tradition. It has a similar feel to it as fist fights during hockey games. NBA and NFL rules have less opportunity for targeting a player outside the rules of the game, but Ron Artest (not the Malice in the Palace incident &#8211; I am referring to in-game violence), Bruce Bowen, Ndamukong Suh, and Albert Haynesworth demonstrate that when there is a will there is a way. However, those incidents are punished by their games and are not considered part of the game. Baseball and hockey enjoy a special distinction that intent to injure or harm outside the game can be considered as part of the game.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Yaakov Weinberg used to say that it was prohibited for a yeshiva student to play tackle football. (Most people did not follow this rule.) His reasoning was simple. How can one play a game where the entire point of the game is to hurt someone else? Now it could be argued that this might display a lack of nuance in understanding the game of tackle football. However, the principle is sound. A game is a game. But when it becomes about inflicting pain on others it moves from game to something else entirely.</p>
<p>People are defending Dempster. They are saying that Arod had it coming. It&#8217;s possible that Arod did deserve it. But I don&#8217;t think that we should support vigilante justice in our sports. Throwing a ball at 95 miles per hour at a very unprotected man is reckless. It happens all the time in baseball but that does not make it right. Intent to harm is not acceptable. I am not saying that pitchers can&#8217;t pitch inside or try to move batters off the plate. I am talking about deliberately throwing at an opponent for the purpose of hitting the opponent with the pitch should be banned. Intent is easy enough to discern in most cases. The grey area cases will require wisdom and good guess work, but I think the price is too high. A game should not provide an outlet for personal and private side shows that take away from the game and make the spectacle into a violent one. We all agree that if the batter would throw his bat at the pitcher he would be out of line. The opposite should be true as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for baseball to eliminate the deliberate bean ball. It has no place in the game and the people of our society should not condone this kind of behavior. Even from athletes.</p>
<p>Hockey? You&#8217;re next on my list.</p>
<p>Watch the play and the amazing Joe Girardi reaction here:</p>

It may seem like your average AL East battle between two up and coming teams, or it could just be a symbolic contest between the two cities with Ner Israel yeshivas, Ner Israel Baltimore and Ner Israel Toronto. (No relation)</p>
<p>One bochur attended the game and I doubt he expected he would be caught on camera during the game. Surely he did not think he would be one of the stars of ESPN SportsCenter.</p>
<p>I hope he wasn&#8217;t skipping <em>seder.</em></p>
<p>Colby Rasmus hit a ball deep into foul territory just foul of left field. Nate McLouth made a spectacular attempt to catch the ball diving into the stands mere inches from our baseball loving yeshiva bochur. It wasn&#8217;t absolutely clear whether the ball was caught. The bochur attempted to clarify matters for the umpire by signaling that it was no catch. In one SportsCenter broadcast, fellow member of the tribe Steve Levy was narrating the highlight and he said something about how &#8220;you got to trust the kid in the cap&#8221; (referring to the bochur&#8217;s yarmulka). The umpire would have none of it and called the batter out.</p>
<p>Clearly the bochur is a Blue Jays fan and he got caught up in the moment. He must have thought he saw the ball pop out of McLouth&#8217;s glove. I&#8217;d hate to think he got caught lying intentionally on national television.</p>
<p><em><strong>EDIT</strong>: The bochur is sticking to his story in the comments below. He says the ball popped out. However, even if the ball did pop out it was a catch before McLouth crashed over the wall. So the umpire made the correct call.</em></p>
<p>The amazing catch finished the night as the SportsCenter Top Play of the night. The catch and the bochur were shown on TV dozens of times. The bochur is famous!<span id="more-7117"></span></p>
<p>Fortunately, the bochur had no part in the beer throwing incident moments later that resulted in the ejection of the guilty fan in the same vicinity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nate-silver-hed-2012.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6433" title="nate-silver-hed-2012" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nate-silver-hed-2012-300x168.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>The election is over. Just over half of the country is happy with the results of the election. Just under half of the country is disappointed with the results of the election. No matter who won, some people would be happy and others would be sad. That&#8217;s just the reality of politics in America today.</p>
<p>However, there is one aspect of the election that should make everyone happy. By everyone, I mean whether you were rooting for Obama or Romney, you have the right to celebrate something.</p>
<p>Everyone should be celebrating with Nate Silver and <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight</a>.</p>
<p>To recap: Nate Silver confidently projected the outcome of the election nearly perfectly. This is not the first time he has done this. Silver has been blisteringly accurate in the two elections he has predicted. He came to politics by route of math and statistics, not policy and analysis. He was perfect last night as well.</p>
<p>While I am thrilled for Silver because he vindicated himself against the doubters (and the homophobes), I think his victory is a victory for all of us.<span id="more-6432"></span></p>
<p>Silver got his start in analyzing baseball statistics using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics" target="_blank">sabermetrics</a>. He sold his model to the premier sabermetrics website and then moved to politics. His methodologies leave very little room for chance and are based on hard mathematical analysis. Silver removes subjectivity and does not rely on logical fallacies in his projections. This is despite entrenched ideas and established trends in analysis. People don&#8217;t like him because he seems like a magician. He somehow knows what will happen without tapping into the usual prediction patterns and totems. This is why pundits could not understand Silver&#8217;s projections. They are speaking a different language. The old media is using grunts and hand motions, while Silver is speaking the Queen&#8217;s English. They didn&#8217;t even realize that Silver was not making <em>predictions</em>, he was issuing <em>projections</em>.</p>
<p>By analogy, baseball has long been a sport which can be predicted with incredible accuracy using statistics. This methodology is known at sabermetrics. It was the cornerstone of the the now-famous Moneyball system of Billy Beane. The idea is that some advanced statistics are more valuable than the &#8220;eye-test&#8221; or traditional statistics like RBI or even batting average. Finding players who produce good advanced statistics but do not produce good traditional statistics and getting those players for cheaper salaries because they are undervalued in the cornerstone of Moneyball. For many years, traditionalists have resisted sabermetrics. They don&#8217;t understand the math. They are jocks, not nerds. But slowly, advanced statistics are going mainstream. We are seeing more baseball people relying on good data as opposed to outdated and less valuable information.</p>
<p>With Silver&#8217;s incredible projections, it is clear that advanced statistics are going mainstream. This is a good thing for all of us. It means breaking down our biases and tendencies to see things the same old way and using math to see things more accurately. It will help society, a lot.</p>
<p>We need to rely less on accepted wisdom and more on science and math.</p>
<p>One correlation that I have seen is that skeptics who challenge conventional wisdom using science and math also exist in religious environment. These people don&#8217;t want to settle for fallacious arguments or accepted norms just because they are accepted norms. This manifests itself in orthodox Judaism with Daas Torah and people who challenge Daas Torah. The Nate Silvers of the world don&#8217;t accept arguments because of Appeal to Authority. The argument needs to stand on its own merits. It can be debated whether this is good for orthodox Jews or bad for orthodox Jews. However, I think it is clear that with the advent of sabertmetrics and fiverthirtyeight style projections that fewer people will be willing to submit themselves to an ephemeral concept like Daas Torah.</p>
<p>As always this leaves us with a choice. Do we double down on Daas Torah? Do we adjust Daas Torah and its expectations? Do we shutter Daas Torah?</p>
<p>Whichever we choose, let us hope that it is the right choice for the sake of truth and God.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/M21554875.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6400" title="M21554875" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/M21554875-300x181.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="181" /></a>The NBA season kicked off last night. The league is 83% non-white player. That makes for an average of 2.55 white players per NBA team (15 player rosters).</p>
<p>So it is definitely notable when a team has more than 3 white players and it is extremely unusual for a team to have 10 white players out of its 15 total players. It might be unusual, but that is this year&#8217;s Minnesota Timberwolves. They are the whitest team in NBA recent memory.</p>
<p>This has created some problems for the team.</p>
<p>A civil rights leader has accused the team of signing white players to appeal to the dominantly white Minneapolis &#8211; St. Paul community. He thinks it is a ploy to get white fans to buy more tickets to see the games.<span id="more-6399"></span></p>
<p>The team owner vehemently denies any such intent.</p>
<p>Not to mention that this tactic makes no sense. To make that assertion, one must assume that the white players are inferior and were chosen not for talent, but were chosen for their skin color despite their lack of talent. To assume that people are so racist that they will buy tickets to watch white players who are inferior to black players is quite an accusation. It means that not only are they racists, but they are idiots. It&#8217;s 2012. Americans want their teams to win more than they want them to look like they do. I&#8217;m very unimpressed with this civil rights activist&#8217;s claim.</p>
<p>The only real problem the team has experienced with so many white players is the choice of music in the locker room according to their lone black starting player, Brandon Roy.</p>
<p>But the latent issues that this accusation raises are worth addressing.</p>
<p>First of all, there are words used by fans and the media to describe players that vary depending on the player&#8217;s ethnicity. Black players are called athletic. White players are called smart. This is not meant to be insulting or racial. It just happens.</p>
<p>Second of all, the question of whether there is a subtle racism when assuming that white players are inferior to black players. While it may be true that more black players are better at basketball than white players, it seems to me that making assumptions based on race or color could be seen as insensitive. On the other hand, is playing probabilities and making snap judgments based on well established norms, racism?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a two way street. If another person feels like a comment being made towards them is racist, I don&#8217;t think the intent really matters. There is certainly merit and value to avoiding words and phrases that others find offensive. This applies whether it is reasonable or not for that person to be offended.</p>
<p>Then again, the street does go the other direction as well. It would be wonderful if we were all a little less sensitive. While it is understandable that some people are very touchy, especially when it comes to race, it would be wise for us all to raise our standard of what offends us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/augusta82012.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6160" title="augusta82012" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/augusta82012-230x300.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="300" /></a>Augusta National Golf Club is famous for two things. It has been the home of the Masters Tournament for about 8o years and it has been a club that excluded women from membership. Women were permitted to play the course but were denied membership.</p>
<p>Pressure to enter women into membership has been ongoing for about 10 years. The club finally relented this week and has admitted two women as members. The two women are Condoleeza Rice and Darla Moore.</p>
<p>This is a major breakthrough. The club is a private club and private institutions have much more leeway in restricting membership than public institutions. Public institutions are subject to the will of the government and legislation. That means that the laws could be &#8220;ahead&#8221; of the public. Sometimes the government establishes a standard that is fair or just but not necessarily the will of the public. However, when a private club changes its policies it is a much more profound statement about the will of the people. A private institution is much more likely to wait until the public demand fairness or justice before it acts. Private institutions rarely establish standards that are &#8220;ahead&#8221; of their time. They are much more likely to establish standards that reflect the public&#8217;s consciousness.<span id="more-6159"></span></p>
<p>Augusta is finally doing what the government did many decades ago. They are treating women just like men with respect to admittance into their private club.</p>
<p>There are two ways to look at this. One is to say that the &#8220;free market&#8221; got it right. A private institution not subject to government regulation figured out that the marketplace wants a club that admits men and women.</p>
<p>The other way to look at this is to say, yes, the free market got it right, but it took way too long! If you wait around for the free market an injustice can perpetuate for years or even decades until the marketplace demands it. The marketplace does not <em>set</em> morality. It merely reflects public opinion. It was wrong for a club to discriminate &#8211; even if the market does not demand it. Waiting for the free market to figure out what is right and what is wrong is not an efficient way of establishing social change. It might get the job done eventually, but sometimes society needs a kick in the pants from authority.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t think that barring women from membership is wrong, just look at Augusta&#8217;s previous policy of not allowing blacks as members until 1990. It took until 1990 for the free market to demand equality based on skin color. <em>1990</em>!</p>
<p>The point is that while the free market might be a great way of running an economic system, I have no comment on that issue at this time, it is a poor way of determining fairness and justice. Case in point: Augusta National.</p>
<p>In closing, Augusta National is a real place and this is a real story. But if it weren&#8217;t, this entire post could be a metaphor for orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/193920.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5728" title="193920" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/193920-233x300.png" alt="" width="233" height="300" /></a>The NFL has decided to give the fans the Holy Grail of NFL Football, the All-22 video.</p>
<p>What is this Holy Grail? It is the film that NFL coaches receive. It is different than broadcast footage because the broadcast only shows a small part of the game. The quarterback is the main focus of the broadcast and the viewer at home does not see what the wide receivers are doing nor do the viewers get a full grasp of how the defense covers the receivers or disguises blitzes. In short, the broadcast footage is very limited in what it allows the viewers at home to see.</p>
<p>ESPN got a very small percentage of All-22 for the NFL Matchup show. But in general, we the public, have never seen enough All-22 to understand the very complex game of the NFL completely.</p>
<p>The All-22 footage gives the viewer a full view of all 22 players on every play. It shows how the schemes look before the play and how the players move through the play. It is the definitive source of all NFL information. It shows everything.</p>
<p><span id="more-5726"></span></p>
<p>For years, the NFL has resisted giving away the All-22 film to the public. Their reasoning was that the public cannot handle the information. They are not initiated in the ways of NFL football like the coaches are and they will misinterpret the information. This will open the players and coaches to unwarranted criticism. Further, the broadcasters do have the All-22 during the game. That&#8217;s how they sound so smart. If people see what the broadcasters see, they will see behind the curtain and realize they are not that smart after all, they just have access to more information.</p>
<p>Now that will all change. We will all be able to see the All-22 footage. The NFL no longer holds the keys to the Ferarri. We all do now.</p>
<p>To me, is representative of a fundamental change in the way we approach information in 2012. Knowledge, wisdom, and information are expected to be accessible to all. They are expected to be available to anyone who wants it. This is the generation of Wikipedia. This is the generation of Google. This is the generation of free information.</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica was a giant leap in making information accessible to many people. But they still needed to shell out a ton of cash to buy a full set or they could mosey on to the library and read it there. But it was not easy accessible to anyone and everyone. That&#8217;s the old model. Wikipedia is the new model. Free information.</p>
<p>The NFL has caught wind of this. They want to please their young fan base. Eventually they caved to pressure and now the most valuable NFL data is available to the public.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s this got to do with Judaism? Mysticism? Rationalism?</p>
<p>One of my favorite Torah scholars is Chacham Jose Faur. One of his favorite theories about the relationship between Maimonidean rationalism and mysticism / kabbalah is very relevant to this decision by the NFL.</p>
<p>Chacham Faur believes that the core of the battle between rationalism and mysticism is the accessibility of knowledge. In the mystical view, kabbalah is received wisdom that comes from great scholars and is imparted to great scholars only. It is not accessible to the masses as it is deemed too dangerous or too esoteric for the common people to grasp. Laws  can be changed based upon this extremely private knowledge base and it can even usurp revealed Torah found in the Talmud. It is so powerful, yet so few can gain entry into the kabbalah club. It takes years of Torah study and personal growth to be worthy of hearing this mystical knowledge.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, we find the teachings of Maimonides. It was his desire to turn this model on its head. Knowledge was to be accessible to all. The Mishneh Torah was written so that everyone who could read was able to access the core text of Judaism. It no longer required a process by which one had to prove himself to be worthy of knowing the law. It was available to everyone. Free information.</p>
<p>This was one of the primary arguments against the Mishneh Torah. It made things too easy.</p>
<p>But to a rationalist, it is impossible to justify keeping wisdom locked away from the public. So Maimonides followed in the footsteps of R&#8217; Yehuda HaNassi and made Torah accessible to all.</p>
<p>This tension exists today as well. On one hand we have groups that try to make kaballah more accessible to the masses. But most orthodox Jews find this unacceptable. On the other hand, we have Daas Torah die-hards who are buying into the same structure as the mystics of the medieval era did with regard to policy setting and halachic decisions. The Daas Torah skeptics are more universalist with their approach to Torah and thus believe that everyone has access to all of Torah, not just a select group of Torah giants.</p>
<p>It is harder than ever to maintain the model of the mystics. The NFL finally gave in to the side rationalism and granted the public access to their information. In the orthodox Jewish world a similar struggle is starting and is likely to continue for the next few years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/good-job-blue-ribbon.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5680" title="good-job-blue-ribbon" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/good-job-blue-ribbon-217x300.png" alt="" width="217" height="300" /></a>After the Celtics defeated the Heat in Game 5 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals in what will surely be remembered as a disastrous game for LeBron, Wade, and company something managed to distract the public from the actual game. As Shane Battier and Ronny Turiaf exited the court through the tunnel the very loud, high pitched voice of a child pierced through the depressing noise of the arena.</p>
<p>While millions of people were watching the dejected Heat hang their heads in shame, one young fan&#8217;s voice pierced through the airwaves with an inspirational message. &#8220;Good job!&#8221; Good effort!&#8221; he cried. His team had just suffered a horrible loss, he must have been in pain, but he rose above it all to give his favorite players a bit of hope and positive reinforcement as they left the court.<span id="more-5678"></span></p>
<p>The young man&#8217;s name is Jack Meyer and he 9 years old. He has been a fan of the Heat since he was 3 or 4 years old and he must have been really upset after that loss. But he probably plays sports in a league and when his team loses or is getting outplayed his coaches probably shout out the same refrain. &#8220;Good job! Good effort!&#8221; I bet it lifts his spirits when he hears it and he just wanted to share the same inspiration to his favorite athletes.</p>
<p>The story is touching and absolutely adorable. You have to admire this kid&#8217;s positivity and his good job and good effort in inspiring his team.</p>
<p>Postivity is so important. We can accomplish so much when we feel good and when we feel like we are doing well. To be sure, pain and suffering can be excellent sources of inspiration as well. Perhaps necessity and anguish are even more effective motivators. But for the majority of us whose lives are not overloaded with pain and suffering, positive reinforcement is a great motivator and a great way to keep us from falling into melancholy or apathy.</p>
<p>But the truth is that sometimes a good job or a good effort is simply not enough. It could be argued that the Heat did not do a good a job and did not give their best effort. But let&#8217;s grant them a good effort and a good job for a moment. They still lost the game! And the game matters. Their job was to win. Their job was to give effort and do a good job but more than that, their goal was to win.</p>
<p>In life, effort matters. But results matter more. Effort matters. But achieving your goals matters more.</p>
<p>I am not trying to be a Grinch. I have a point. I think that we all have passions and responsibilities in our lives. And sometimes we neglect them. But we pat ourselves on the back and say &#8220;Good job! Good Effort! and think that is enough. It&#8217;s a start. But it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>If we want to learn more Torah, give more charity, spend more time with our spouses and children, do more acts of lovingkindness, make a difference in our communities, we can&#8217;t be satisfied with good effort. We need to demand from ourselves action and results. We all want to do more than we are doing. We can each apply this to various areas of our lives.</p>
<p>Much of the talk on the Internet is effort and sometimes it&#8217;s a good job. But if we don&#8217;t actually accomplish anything, we are not maximizing our opportunities. So many great ideas and conversations happen on the blogs and Facebook and Twitter (notice I left out Google Plus&#8230;), we need to somehow channel all of that into actual change.</p>
<p>It can be done. It must be done. Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<p>Your inspiration:</p>

I would love to see the court&#8217;s reasoning on this one. A grumpy sounding retort from the chairman of TAPPS was that &#8220;unlike many people, TAPPS follows the law&#8221;. So they will comply and Beren can play!</p>
<p>Link: <a href="http://www.chron.com/sports/article/Beren-Academy-allowed-to-play-state-semifinal-3374028.php" target="_blank">Houston Chronicle</a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Beren Academy of Houston is a modern orthodox day school. I know several of their alumni and respect the school greatly.</p>
<p>By now you&#8217;ve probably heard the news that the Beren Academy has a superb high school basketball team and that they made it to the semi-finals of their league. The next game is scheduled for Friday night. The team refuses to play on Shabbos and asked for a special dispensation to enable them to play before Shabbos. The request was denied and the team has forfeited the game thus ending their season.</p>
<p>This story has been reported everywhere from the NY Times to ESPN.</p>
<p>The reactions have been mixed. Everyone who is Shabbos observant sees this sacrifice as a kiddush Hashem. Many of us are able to be Shabbos observant without sacrificing anything other than NCAA football, golfing with corporate bigwigs, or other less than vital activities. Compared to my great grandfather who lost his job every Saturday and was kicked out of his home by his sisters for keeping Shabbos, we have it easy. These Beren students are throwbacks to a an era where Shabbos observance was more difficult than it is today. Their commitment to Shabbos and Judaism is inspiring.<span id="more-5203"></span></p>
<p>Those who are not Shabbos observant see this as an impressive commitment to something they do not fully appreciate. But it reminds them that there is more to life and sports than winning.</p>
<p>What gets interesting is the reaction to the denied request for rescheduling. Some people are calling this anti-Semitism. I disagree. Sort of.</p>
<p>The school knew in advance that the tournament was scheduled over Shabbos. They were told in advance that the tournament would not be changed to accommodate them. There is no reason to expect that the tournament would adjust when Beren knew going in that the tournament was not going to be adjusted. To make the claim that the tournament stuck to its original proposal that Beren agreed to, rises to anti-Semitism is absurd.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it could be argued that the original agreement was biased by a soft anti-Semitism. Beren did agree that they would be forced to forfeit in the event a game occurred on Shabbos. But why did it have to be this way? Wouldn&#8217;t it be appropriate to accommodate the Jewish team that abides by their religious beliefs and will not play on Shabbos? I think it would have been prudent for the tournament organizers to agree beforehand to accommodate. Once the agreement not to accommodate was established it is disingenuous to expect that they would change it simply to avoid the appearance of anti-Semitism. It would have been preferable if the agreement was to allow them to change the game but that was simply not the case.</p>
<p>Making matters worse is the fact that this league refuses to play on Sunday due to the very religious beliefs of the other schools. It seems incongruous to insist that the Jewish team be forced to concede on their Sabbath and the Christian teams are banned from playing on their Sabbath. One would hope that members of other religions could appreciate the religion of the other. But sometimes religious people are nearsighted and only see their religion as religious. It could that is what happened here. I wouldn&#8217;t classify myopia as anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>It is also wrong to say &#8220;if this were a Muslim school of Seventh Day Adventist school the tournament would have accommodated.&#8221; This is complete conjecture and I venture to say that with a prior agreement in hand, the result would have been the same. Not everything is anti-Semitism. In fact, most things are not.</p>
<p>Or maybe it speaks to a different anti-Semitic bias. Who could have predicted that the Jewish school would have such good athletes&#8230;? The prior agreement was never expected to make a difference!</p>
<p>In any event, the story is heartwarming. It reminds us of our commitment to Shabbos. It reminds us that sometimes being a Shabbos observer means giving something up. Hopefully the lesson will be a positive one for the kids at Beren. Hopefully it will not lead to resentment over missing the opportunity to win a championship and will instead reinforce their strength of conviction to Shabbos.</p>
<p>The fact that this story has struck a chord and is being reported in the biggest new outlets speaks to the novelty of this story. The articles I have seen have all been respectful and admiring. Especially when contrasted with the horrible news out of the high school in Ohio, these kids look like heroes. At the very least, Shabbos is making positive headlines. We can be thankful for that.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that with all the press, the tournament will acquiesce. I would be happy for the team if this happens. But I don&#8217;t love the idea of whiny Jews getting their way. Hopefully, if the tournament relents, that will not be the narrative. Instead the narrative will be religious tolerance, conviction of belief, good basketball.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120127-0847151.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5081" title="20120127-084715.jpg" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120127-0847151-300x181.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="181" /></a>Last Sunday, two NFL teams advanced to the Super Bowl. Two other teams lost and were sent home for the winter.</p>
<p>One of the notable things about both games was the lack of heroes for the winning teams. Instead of the winning teams making a great play to win the game, both of the losing teams made mistakes that gave the game away. Instead of heroes we had goats.</p>
<p>In the first game, the Ravens made three consecutive heartbreakingly poor plays. First a dropped touchdown, then a bad pass when the quarterback could have run for a few yards and then a missed field goal from close range. The players who made the biggest mistakes, the receive who dropped the pass and the kicker who missed the kick lost the game for their team. Or at least it appears that way to the observer. Obviously mistakes in the beginning of the game are just as costly as mistakes at the end of the game. Yet, we somehow place greater emphasis on the glaring mistakes at the end of the game.</p>
<p>In our house we are fans of the Ravens. It was shocking and disappointing to see them lose in this fashion. Especially so, for my eight year old son. He was upset as I am sure millions of other Ravens fans across the country.</p>
<p>The second game featured an even worse anti-hero. Kyle Williams fumbled the ball twice in crucial kick return situations. He gave the ball back to the Giants and cost his tea the game. It was heartbreaking for him and for 49ers fans everywhere. It was his fault that the Giants won and people were really mad at him.</p>
<p><span id="more-5082"></span></p>
<p>Some people sent him <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/49ers/2012/01/23/kyle-williams-receiving-death-threats-after-nfc-championship/">death threats.</a>. Others just said horrible things about him. One seven year old boy was also upset after seeing Williams give away the game.</p>
<p>He was crying &#8220;but&#8230; why&#8230; did&#8230; he have to fumble?!&#8221;</p>
<p>His father replied, &#8220;if you are so upset, how do you think he feels?&#8221;</p>
<p>To which the boy responded by asking if he could write a letter to Kyle Williams to &#8220;make him feel better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is what the kid wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Dear Mr. Williams:</em></p>
<p>We just watched the Playoff game. I feel really bad for you but I wanted to tell you that you had a great season. you sould be very proud, so I wanted to say thank you.</p>
<p>I am your #1 FAN!</p>
<p>Owen Shure<br />
Los Angeles, CA</p>
<p>p.s. your awsome</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>You gotta love this kid. But even more than the kid, I think you gotta love the father!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure he was upset too. Most people who invest time into sports are somewhat affected by wins and losses. All the more so a heart wrenching loss like the one suffered by the Niners on Sunday. This father used it as a great teaching moment for himself and his son. Athletes are people too. They make mistakes and it hurts them when they make mistakes.</p>
<p>The anger towards athletes when they don&#8217;t live up to our lofty expectations can cause people to do stupid things. They write death threats and forget that their sports heroes have feelings too.</p>
<p>No one feels worse than the goats of these big games. Hatred and anger towards them is immature and misguided.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rest of country has to deal with another championship that will be decided between teams from New York and Boston. That&#8217;s something to get upset about! (Just kidding.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tim-tebow-tebowing.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4870" title="tim-tebow-tebowing" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tim-tebow-tebowing.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" /></a>There is nothing quite like Tim Tebow.</p>
<p>He is one of the most decorated NCAA Football players of all time. He worked for years as a Missionary spreading the Gospel in Southeast Asia. He is arguably the worst passing quarterback in the NFL. He is by far the most talked about sports personality.</p>
<p>Quite a combination. Much of the talk of Tim Tebow relates to his very obvious religious beliefs. I say they are obvious because Tebow kneels in prayer during the game. He points to the sky all the time. He invokes the name of his God every time he has a chance to do so. Tebow&#8217;s antics inspired an entire internet meme called <a href="http://tebowing.com/" target="_blank">#Tebowing</a>. People would kneel as if in prayer at the most awkward times and places and snap a picture. This is aside from the very clever <a href="http://occupytebow.com/" target="_blank">#occupytebow</a> movement which is not relevant to this blog post.</p>
<p>The point is that Tebow takes his religion very seriously. Whenever athletes thank God and praise God for their accomplishments it can be irksome to everyone. Religious people of the same religion, religious people of other religions and atheists can all find ways to be offended.</p>
<p>Does God really want the Home team to beat the Away team? Does God really give special powers to some teams and not to other teams? Does a player&#8217;s religious conviction really have an impact on a game?<span id="more-4868"></span></p>
<p>I think the answer to all those questions is no. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/30/whose-fault-is-a-dropped-game-wininng-touchdown/">Whose Fault is a Dropped Game-Wininng Touchdown?</a> for my feelings on this one.</p>
<p>In fact, please read that post because you&#8217;ll see that I actually agree with Tim Tebow on this issue.</p>
<p>Tebow was asked about invoking God as part of his athletic accomplishments and he didn&#8217;t take the bait. He answered that he doesn&#8217;t give God the credit or the blame. He is merely using his platform as a way of teaching people about his religion. He emphatically denied that his religion gives him an edge or that he can play better because of God. He focused on the opportunity to use his fame and success to glorify the name of his God.</p>
<p>He also mentions that football does not define him. He is defined by his morality and good acts. He is defined by his character. So his religion is not a cause. It is merely a basis for his life. It is not part of his game on the field.</p>
<p>I think that is a great answer. Great job by Tebow.</p>
<p>What is interesting to me is that Tebow invokes the name of his God, Jesus, and that is somewhat acceptable within society. Imagine a Muslim player praising Allah or a Jewish person praising God (not Jesus). I don&#8217;t think they would be as accepted.</p>
<p>Christian displays of religious fervor are far more tolerated than that of any other religion. It can make the rest of us feel uncomfortable. Tebow is doing it in a way that minimizes the discomfort for others but even his way has rankled many people. It would be wise for people to limit religion to religious activities and not pepper it throughout their public lives.</p>
<p>Watch Tebow&#8217;s interview. The religious stuff is near the end:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Discussion-NBA-Lockout.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4856" title="Discussion-NBA-Lockout" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Discussion-NBA-Lockout-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a>Sports fans know that the NBA is currently undergoing a labor dispute between Ownership and the players represented by their Union. The dispute has led to two drastic measures.</p>
<p>First, the owners &#8220;locked out&#8221; the players. This means that the owners of the teams told the players that they would not allow them to play or earn paychecks unless they negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement. They tried negotiating. No deal was struck.</p>
<p>Next the players decertified their union. They are now individuals negotiating and no longer a union and they are suing the owners for anti-trust violations.</p>
<p>There are several very interesting things to note about these negotiations that would interest non-sports fans. This post deals with one.</p>
<p>Normally, unions are supported by liberals and ownership is supported by conservatives. I don&#8217;t need to explain this is too much detail it is fairly self-evident.</p>
<p>So knee-jerk reactionists, I know one particularly bombastic fellow in particular, will define their allegiances in this dispute based on their social / political beliefs. So knee-jerk conservatives will side with the owners and liberals will side with the players.</p>
<p>This is a mistake.<span id="more-4855"></span></p>
<p>The NBA is not like any other business for several reasons. What is relevant here is that the owners are not the same as any other group of ownership. In the NBA the owners have already imposed a team wide salary cap and maximum contracts as well as highly regulated contracts over the course of the first five years of every single player&#8217;s career.</p>
<p>This means that the best, most valuable players are unable to earn their actual value. Let&#8217;s take Kobe Bryant. Kobe is slated to earn $25,244,000 this year. That sounds like a lot of money and it is. But he is actually worth MORE than that. So the owners have regulated the salaries to the point that Kobe CANNOT earn market value for his services. It would be like the banking industry saying that a CFO can only make $5 million dollars a year even if he brings $35 million of revenue each year. This is not something conservatives should support.</p>
<p>Further, at this point in the negotiations, the players are fighting for issues regarding movement of players. Owners want the salary cap to be so draconian that a team would not be able sign players that really want to play for them. The owners want to keep players in the places where they drafter for longer. The players will have little to no say as to where they work. This is not very free market like either. Again, not something that conservatives should support.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is that small market owners are unhappy that they are not making money. There are many reasons a team might not be making money. But the single biggest expense for most teams is the salaries of their players. Teams with less income cannot afford to overspend on players. Yet, this is exactly what they do. A small market team gave Rashard Lewis, a two time NBA All Star who is a typical second or third best player on a team, $22,152,000 for this coming season. That is the second highest NBA salary. It is a terrible contract. Is it any wonder that the team that made that deal is losing money. Irresponsible spending is a huge factor in the bottom line of NBA teams. Whose fault is it if that team does not make money? The players? No. It is the owner&#8217;s. There are many many bad contracts in the NBA. Dumb owners are demanding a bailout and future safety net. Regulating contracts to the degree that it is impossible for an owner to make a mistake is not Capitalism. This is not something a conservative should support.</p>
<p>It turns out that in these negotiations, the union is arguing for conservative economic principles and the owners are arguing for more socialist principles. Conservatives should support the players. As hard as it may be to say the words &#8220;I support a union&#8221; or &#8220;I support labor&#8221; in this instance, the union and labor are the side that is more aligned with conservative beliefs.</p>
<p><em>(I believe that liberals should also support the players but that is not the point of this post.)</em></p>

<p>The NY Times has been busy with a story about Ralph Branca and his heritage.</p>
<p>Who is Ralph Branca? He&#8217;s the guy who gave up the &#8220;shot heard &#8217;round the word&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the &#8220;shot heard &#8217;round the world&#8221;? The home run hit by Bobby Thompson of the New York Giants that was immediately followed by &#8220;THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT!&#8221;</p>
<p>Branca has a largely ignominious place in sports lore because he gave up that epic home run.</p>
<p>During an investigative report on his life by reporter Joshua Prager, it was discovered that Branca&#8217;s mother was a Jew who emigrated to the United States in 1901 from what was then Hungary. Branca was as shocked as anyone to learn that his mother was a Jew. Perhaps he was even more shocked to discover that <em>he</em> was a Jew as well. For in Jewish law, if one&#8217;s mother is Jewish, one is Jewish!</p>
<p>Branca was raised Catholic.</p>
<p>As a kid, Branca was a &#8220;Shabbos goy&#8221;, a term I despise for its less than glamorous connotations. He performed certain tasks forbidden for Jews on the Sabbath. (In all likelihood, it was equally impermissible for those Jews to ask young Ralphie to perform those tasks on their behalf, but I digress.) Branca is quoted at the end of the story in the Times as saying that he better remain a Catholic, otherwise he would have been liable for all his &#8220;helpfulness&#8221;. To save his soul, Branca, now 85, says he must remain Catholic.</p>
<p>His faulty logic notwithstanding, Branca is a Jew.<span id="more-4512"></span></p>
<p>At least according to Jewish law he is a Jew.</p>
<p>Alan Dershowitz is of a different mind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Ralph Branca is not a Jew,” said Alan Dershowitz, a Brooklyn-born Dodgers fan, lawyer and Harvard professor. “Whatever the definition, it doesn’t include someone who willingly accepted a different religion. He didn’t stay home on Yom Kippur like Koufax.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Koufax altered strength and guile and knew that you pitch for six days and you rest on the seventh,” he said. “Branca was straight-on; you could see there was nothing Jewish about Ralph Branca.”</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear if Dershowitz made these comments before the revelation that Branca&#8217;s mother was Jewish. If it was before, the big reveal then I am not sure what the Times is using this quote for. It is was after the revelation that Branca&#8217;s mother was a Jew I am completely at lost at how someone&#8217;s non-choice, Branca was raised Catholic or someone pitching style can be the determining factor as to one&#8217;s Jewishness. What in the world is Dershowitz saying?</p>
<p>According to Jewish law Branca is a Jew. Whether he knew it or cared for or not, he is a Jew. In this respect, Judaism is a family. A long lost cousin who did not know he was related to you can&#8217;t be excluded from the family because he has a different style than the rest of the family (if that is even a reasonable assertion, which it is not).</p>
<p>I am disappointed in Dershowitz and I welcome Ralph Branca to the tribe. Even if he was always part of it and even if he doesn&#8217;t want to be&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Deion+Sanders+Shannon+Sharpe+oxdD_wsPVTjm.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4498" title="Deion+Sanders+Shannon+Sharpe" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Deion+Sanders+Shannon+Sharpe+oxdD_wsPVTjm-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Over the weekend, NFL greats, Deion Sanders and Shannon Sharpe were inducted into the National Football League Hall of Fame among others. These two men are famous for their on the field accomplishments as well as their gifts of speech. Both Sanders and Sharpe have had successful careers as commentators and for good reason. These guys can talk.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that their induction speeches were highly anticipated.</p>
<p>The reviews of their speeches are in and they are mixed. I am not going to grade their performances, but I do have something to say about the content of their speeches.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2011/8/8/2349026/deion-sanders-shannon-sharpe-pro-football-hall-of-fame-speech" target="_blank">Both spent considerable time talking about their childhood</a>. They both came from poor, disadvantaged homes. Both were slightly embarrassed by their upbringing. More importantly, both credited their difficult youth as motivation to succeed in the NFL. They wanted &#8220;out&#8221; so badly that were willing to do whatever it took to become the best players they could be.<span id="more-4497"></span> Luckily for them, they made it.</p>
<p>It seemed from their words that despite all their success, the pain and agony of their childhood has not been assuaged by their mammoth success. They still feel the trauma of their early years even though they made it out. And they made it out in a huge way.</p>
<p>It takes a lot to overcome adversity. Overcoming difficult circumstances is also a tremendous motivator. There are few forces that drive a person to success more than necessity. The need to get out is so powerful that it provides super talented people with a glimmer of hope that they can escape their hellish lives.</p>
<p>People born with less adversity are harder to motivate. Why work as hard when life is easy? Why try to change things if things are just dandy? There are far fewer professional athletes from wealthy homes than from tough neighborhoods. It is simple to understand. When you need a ticket out, you&#8217;ll do anything you can to punch that ticket.</p>
<p>For Ashkenazik Jews, our current predicament is unfamiliar. For hundreds of years we have been victims. Violence, segregation, ostracization and victimization described our existence. It boiled over during the Holocaust but was horrible many times and for many years before the Holocaust as well.</p>
<p>For all those years we desperately wanted to get out. Tisha B&#8217;Av was easy to feel. Our lives were so difficult and our situations were so dire that it motivated us to experience Tisha B&#8217;Av with tears and genuine desire for our Temple to be rebuilt. Our daily existence justified an intense desire to &#8220;make the new days into the days of old&#8221;.</p>
<p>There was a transitional period as Jews made their way to America. My great-grandfather quit his job every Friday because he refused to work on Shabbos. Eventually, his sisters kicked him out of his home. That was America in the early days.</p>
<p>But now we are comfortable. We have come a long way. Jews live middle to upper class lives in America. We have religious freedom. Kosher food is ubiquitous. We can visit all the important places in the Land of Israel. It is easy to study Torah. We have it good. Real good. Maybe too good.</p>
<p>Where is our motivation?</p>
<p>How are we to work up the emotions necessary to feel Tisha B&#8217;Av?</p>
<p>It can be tough.</p>
<p>I propose that as hard and as painful as it may be, we should contemplate the social issues that plague Judaism. We need to consider the difficulty of the orthodox and especially non-orthodox communities in maintaining our religious identity in such a free world. We can think about how freedom has given rise to a slew of new, first world problems.</p>
<p>What I am saying, is we should look as critically as we can at contemporary Judaism. Even though the glass is much more than half full and for 353 days a year we need to appreciate our good fortune, on Tisha B&#8217;Av we need to look at the glass as almost completely empty.</p>
<p>That is what we are mourning. We don&#8217;t have it all. And we want it all.</p>
<p>Once a year we can focus on the negative. We can remind ourselves that although we are much more advantaged than our grandparents were, we are still a desolate nation living at best, a halfway existence.</p>
<p>It can be hard to do. But no one said Tisha B&#8217;Av was supposed to be easy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/9_dodgers_stadium_limo_orange_county.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4470" title="dodgers_stadium" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/9_dodgers_stadium_limo_orange_county-300x230.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="230" /></a>The LAPD has arrested two new suspects in the Brian Stow beating.</p>
<p>They have also exonerated their first suspect Giovanni Ramirez. Ramirez was never charged in the attack because investigators felt there was not enough evidence to get past the preliminary hearing. Instead, Ramirez is in jail for violating his parole when guns were found in the home where he was living. That got him 10 months in jail.</p>
<p>The case is disturbing on quite a few levels.</p>
<p>What bothers me more than anything about the Ramirez arrest is summed up nicely with this quote from the LA Times:<span id="more-4469"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span>&#8220;The LAPD&#8217;s case against Ramirez stalled from the start. Police took him into custody during an early morning raid May 22 after a parole agent raised suspicion that Ramirez might be one of the assailants, </span><strong>and then multiple witnesses identified him from photo lineups</strong>.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>This means that although there was no forensic evidence, there was plenty of exculpatory evidence, like an alibi, Ramirez was arrested because multiple people identified him in photo lineups.</p>
<p>But if he is being exonerated it is clear that he didn&#8217;t commit the crime. So why was he identified by anyone?</p>
<p>Were those identifying witnesses liars?</p>
<p>Eyewitness identification is one of the weakest forms of evidence. Yet is given disproportionate weight by law enforcement and juries. People think they can remember what someone looks like. But, by and large, we are terrible at it. We get even worse when the witness is from another race.</p>
<p>Add that to shady police work, like hinting at the &#8220;correct identification&#8221; and you have a toxic mix of <span>unreliability</span> and sneakiness.</p>
<p>Eyewitness identifications have put innocent people in jail, even given them the death penalty. Ramirez is just the latest victim. A lucky victim too. If those identification witnesses testified in court that they saw Ramirez, you can bet dollars to donuts he would have been convicted.</p>
<p>I wrote a paper on the science behind bad IDs and how to fix some the problems inherent to IDs in court proceedings. Hopefully it will be published soon.</p>
<p>In Jewish Law, eyewitnesses need to be vetted so carefully that it is literally impossible for them to lie. And if they somehow pass through the vetting process and are caught lying later on, they are punished for their lies. There is no such system in secular law. Just a cross-examination at trial and rarely any punishment for lying.</p>
<p>Nothing can teach the public how flawed eyewitness identification is like real life examples in the news. Perhaps this is the silver lining to the botched Ramirez arrest. At least the LAPD and LADA were honest enough not to try Ramirez. But now is the time to teach the public about eyewitness identification. They mean very little.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Andrew_Bynum_Handicapped_Parking-300x166.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4462" title="Andrew_Bynum_Handicapped_Parking-300x166" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Andrew_Bynum_Handicapped_Parking-300x166.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="166" /></a>Lakers center Andrew Bynum found himself on the local and national news for the wrong reasons this week. It seems that Bynum makes the news every off-season for some reason or another.</p>
<p>This is the second time he made news in a shopping mall parking lot. Last time it was Kobe Bryant saying to ship him out on video while in a parking lot. This time, Bynum was caught on camera parking his car in a handicapped spot.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, it is not a big deal. People do it all the time. Who could forget the time <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YHz493rnLw" target="_blank">George Costanza needed a parking spot in a pinch so he pulled into the handicapped spot</a>?</p>
<p>Of course, the Bynum haters have used this to prove how immature Bynum is. It&#8217;s hard to take such criticism seriously because Andrew Bynum is only 23 years old. At that age, being immature is normal.</p>
<p>The incident resonated with me for a completely different reason.<span id="more-4461"></span></p>
<p>Laws in secular countries, like the USA, are man made rules. For every rule there is a reaction, punishment, fine and stigma associated with the breaking of the rule. Commit murder and the punishment may be the death penalty, or life without possibility of parole (ie death in prison). Get caught speeding, you get a fine for a few hundred dollars. Skip out on paying your taxes, risk jailtime and a heavy fine.</p>
<p>The punishments may be deterrents, forms of retribution, attempts to rehabilitate or simply incapacitation. If you are willing to pay the price, there&#8217;s nothing really stopping you from breaking the law. It&#8217;s a risk / reward analysis.</p>
<p>If someone is able to afford speeding tickets, they can choose to speed and pay the fine is they get caught. For Andrew Bynum the risk of getting a ticket (he didn&#8217;t) did not outweigh the reward of parking up close. Is this immature? Sure. Is it a reasonable way of thinking within our system? I think so.</p>
<p>But when contrasted with a system of religious law, like Jewish law, another possibility enters the picture.</p>
<p>In Jewish law, there is a moral imperative to follow the law. This means that even if you want to break the law and take your punches and suffer the eternal punishment, you have acted immorally. In fact, the rabbis teach us that if someone says &#8220;I will sin and then repent, even the forgiveness attained on Yom Kippur won&#8217;t forgive that sin&#8221;. In religious law, the act is wrong. The punishment is incentive to do the right thing. But the law represents the right thing.</p>
<p>Now, I am not advocated a system of religious law in any free country. That would be a terrible idea. How can there be freedom when there is a system of law that only works for some people? (And calls non-believers heretics / infidels etc.?)</p>
<p>But if I had all the money in the world, there would still be an imperative for me not to take that handicap spot. Jewish law requires giving up a seat (or in this case, parking spot) for anyone elderly or infirm. Parking in the spot might be okay, but if someone who needs the spot comes by and is forced to take a different spot, I (may) have violated the law. Religious law superimposed on top of secular law can work very well. In this case, there would be no risk / reward analysis. It would not matter if I was willing to pay the price. If it is wrong, I cannot do it. Driving recklessly would fall under the same category. In Jewish law, one is not permitted to put their life in danger. Driving too fast is dangerous. Even if I am willing to pay the fine, I can&#8217;t drive so fast that it would dangerous because it is wrong to do so.</p>
<p>Andrew Bynum acted in a way that is consistent with how secular law works. Having a religious law to superimpose on those laws could go a long way to not rationalizing breaking the law.</p>
<p>How timely are the <a href="http://www.chiefrabbi.org/ReadArtical.aspx?id=1781" target="_blank">words of the Chief Rabbi</a> of  the UK, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks on this week&#8217;s Torah portion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Torah sets forth a&#8230; way, in which people obey the law because they have voluntarily undertaken to do so. This is a society based not on power or the pursuit of self-interest but on freely embraced moral obligation.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/118737581_extra_large.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4417" title="118737581_extra_large" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/118737581_extra_large-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>On Sunday the USA Women&#8217;s soccer team played against the Brazil Women&#8217;s soccer team in a quarter-final World Cup match.</p>
<p>Soccer is a wonderful sport. My son loves to play, whenever I watch it I enjoy it. I really want to go to a World Cup or English Premier League game someday. Yet, soccer plays 4th or 5th or even 6th fiddle for most sports fans.</p>
<p>To be fair, a lot of the under 30 crowd loves soccer and are avid soccer fans. But by and large, soccer is not an American pastime.</p>
<p>But in my opinion, soccer produces some of the most magical moments in all of sports.<span id="more-4411"></span> Landon Donovan scored a winning goal against Algeria in extra time during the 2010 Mens World Cup. It was a magical moment. But I believe it has been outclassed by a more magical moment during Sunday&#8217;s match. The USA Women are a top team and they were playing against a top team. The USA was down one goal in extra time of an extra period. Then this happened:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why, but sports in general, soccer more than most, especially the USA National Teams has the ability to brings tears to my eyes. Something about soccer tugs at my heartstrings more than other sports or entertainment. I find the sheer joy and bliss of soccer players in a moment like this very inspiring.</p>
<p>I hope you do as well.</p>

<p>The chasidic town of New Square (an enclave that is very similar to KJ) has found itself in the news for all the wrong reasons. Last week an 18 year old goon attempted to burn down a man&#8217;s home along with the people inside the home. The target had been a victim of intimidation and vandalism on previous occasions so he had recently installed a surveillance system of cameras around his home. It was on these cameras that the victim first saw the goon. He went outside and confronted the goon.</p>
<p>A short brawl ensued and the goon lit his Molotov cocktail and fled. Both men caught on fire but the house was spared. The victim suffered severe burns all over his body and has already undergone skin grafts.</p>
<p>The arson and attempted murder were escalations of previous action against the victim. Prior to this incident he had been subject to protests in front of his home, broken windows in his car and his home.</p>
<p>What crime did the victim commit that sparked vandalism and violence?<span id="more-4297"></span></p>
<p>He prayed at an old age home nearby instead of praying in the community synagogue. The grand rabbi of New Square requires that all residents of New Square attend the same prayer service on Friday nights. The victim did not attend. The goons were enforcing the rabbi&#8217;s rule.</p>
<p>No one excuses the behavior of the goon. Social pressure is one thing, by violence is inexcusable. It would be unfair for me or anyone to place specific blame on anyone other than the goon who committed this act. There is no hard evidence that he was instructed to do what he did. There is some circumstantial evidence but for purposes of this article, it will be conceded that this person acted alone.</p>
<p>One response that I have seen on blogs, Twitter posts and Facebook comments is that the victim &#8220;had it coming&#8221;. (See: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/05/avi-shafran-on-new-square.html">Avi Shafran on New Square</a>) The village has a rule. He chose to live there and should expect that he will suffer some indignity for his failure to live by the standard of the village. Further, if he doesn&#8217;t like the rules, he should have left the village instead of staying AND breaking the rules.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this completely misses the point.</p>
<p>There was another scandal this week. The Head Football Coach at Ohio State University resigned amid a whirlwind of allegations that he assisted and enabled players to break the rules of NCAA. The players are being disciplined and their Head Coach, Jim Tressel has resigned and is being crucified in the media.</p>
<p>Jason Whitlock wrote a really great column about the scandal (<a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/Former-Ohio-State-coach-Jim-Tressel-is-product-of-flawed-system-053111" target="_blank">Tressel Product of Flawed System</a>). Whitlock contends, and I agree with him, that while Tressel is culpable for his sins, he is really just the product of a system built on lies. The primary lie being that student athletes are amateur. Whitlock has been saying forever, and I have been agreeing just as long, that the NCAA is the biggest fraud in America. They make billions of dollars off of these athletes but the athletes see none of that money. To maintain amateur status they must adhere to thousands of rules that basically prohibit them from taking any gifts or benefits from anybody.</p>
<p>Tressel was just part of the system. He didn&#8217;t create the problem. He didn&#8217;t make the problem worse. He was just a cog in a mighty machine. Indeed, he broke the rules. However the system is deeply flawed and everyone is breaking the rules that the real criminal here is not Tressel. It is the NCAA. [The same should be said for USC, Reggie Bush, OJ Mayo and Pete Carrol.]
<p>What happened in New Square is the result of a flawed system.</p>
<p>Any system that demands absolute fealty in every respect of one&#8217;s life, stripping one of independence and the opportunity to think and choose is a bad system. Any system that demonizes someone for asserting one smidgen of original thought is a bad system.</p>
<p>The perpetrators of violence and social terrorism are cogs in the machine. The machine is the problem. It isn&#8217;t the cogs.</p>
<p>To complete the analogy, the arsonist was a football player, the leadership is Jim Tressel and they are all part of a system like the NCAA.</p>
<p>The system needs to be fixed. The cogs are all responsible for their actions but the most frustrating thing is that their actions <em>are justifiable in the system.</em> That is why the system needs to be scrapped. It permits behavior like this to occur. This incident is only one example of a rotten system. There are more.</p>
<p>Maintaining control over people is not easy. But with per se poverty and social terror it becomes easier to enforce. That is part of the reason why the Kiryas Joel situation is so problematic. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/31/thoughts-on-kiryas-joel-the-poorest-city-in-america/">Thoughts on Kiryas Joel: The Poorest City in America</a>). It creates a breeding ground for anti-social behavior.</p>
<p>According to Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch the Torah is designed to create a positive social environment for growth and spiritual development. It can&#8217;t be that poverty, oppression, terror and anti-social behavior are the <em>darchei noam</em>, pleasant ways of the Torah. It just can&#8217;t.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scottie-pippen.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4287" title="scottie-pippen" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scottie-pippen-239x300.jpg" alt="" width="167" height="210" /></a>Last week the outrage over President Obama&#8217;s mideast speech was built around a partial quote of his words.</p>
<p>Critics quoted Obama&#8217;s statement that the future borders of Israel should be based on the 1967 borders. They neglected to quote the end of the statement which qualified that statement with the important caveat &#8220;with mutually agreed upon land swaps&#8221;. For some reason, the outrage that ensued only mentioned the 1967 borders. No one that was outraged included the context of the statement which made the 1967 borders statement much weaker.</p>
<p>(Now, even after Obama clarified his remarks some people were still outraged over other issues. I am not talking about those people.)</p>
<p>Today, one of the greatets NBA players of all time, Scottie Pippen, was asked about whether LeBron could be better than Michael Jordan, the greatest NBA player of all time. Pippen said, &#8220;&#8230;he may be&#8230;&#8221;.</p>
<p>There is outrage. <span id="more-4286"></span>See Jordan is more than a bit of a deity in NBA circles. He is the best ever. And I don&#8217;t think anyone will ever be as dominant as Jordan was in his time. LeBron is great, but he is no Jordan. Not in numbers or in accomplishments and certainly not in dedication to winning. So if Pippen had said that LeBron was better than Jordan the outrage would be warranted.</p>
<p>But Pippen did not say that. His words are being taken out of context. He said, &#8220;he may be&#8221;, which means that one day, perhaps LeBron will surpass Jordan.</p>
<p>How can anyone outrage over that? Heck, any player MAY surpass Jordan.</p>
<p>But of course, when it comes to politics, sports [and religion], people are irrational. Irrationality causes people to miss context and explode before they can analyze the issues.</p>
<p>Last week it was Obama, this week it was Pippen. Who will be next week&#8217;s victim?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/byu.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3867" title="byu" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/byu-297x300.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="240" /></a>Brigham Young University is operated by the Church of Latter Day Saints. It is a Mormon school run with Mormon principles. The school has an athletics department and has had some very successful teams as well professional athletes. Some of whom have even made the Hall of Fame for their respective sports.</p>
<p>This year, BYU&#8217;s basketball team is a national sensation. Their star player Jimmer Fredette is receiving national attention and may be the best player in all of college basketball. He has led the team to a national ranking of 3 in both the major college polls. One of their primary role players is Brandon Davies. Or perhaps I should say, was Brandon Davies.<span id="more-3866"></span></p>
<p>Davies was cut from the team today.</p>
<p>His infraction? He &#8220;violated the BYU Honor Code&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a Mormon School, BYU expects their students to live by Mormon rules. This means many things. It means no alcohol or coffee. I know. It&#8217;s hard to imagine college without them. It means conservative clothing. It means no foul language. It means no gambling.</p>
<p>It also means no premarital sex. 51% of BYU&#8217;s graduates are married.</p>
<p>Brandon Davies was not married and he had sex with his girlfriend. (I love how the university calls it &#8220;sexual relations&#8221;. How Biblical of them&#8230;)</p>
<p>Violating The Honor Code is not grounds for immediate dismissal from the University. But it can be. Davies has not been kicked out of school. But in a serious blow to BYU&#8217;s National Championship hopes, he has been dismissed from the team.</p>
<p>There is so much to say about this story from so many angles.</p>
<p>The first thing is that Davies signed The Honor Code so it&#8217;s absolutely reasonable for him to be kicked off the team for violated the code. Even if the infraction was something that almost all other college students in almost all other colleges engage in. I have no problem with him being kicked off the team. Plus, it&#8217;s nice to see an organization actually live up to their word.</p>
<p>The second thing is the code. I think it&#8217;s very admirable that BYU has a code that requires its students to live up to their version of what is right and wrong. I had a similar situation. I did not go to a typical undergraduate university. I went to yeshiva. The rules of Yeshiva make the BYU Honor Code look liberal. Although, coffee was certainly a big part of our day and alcohol was served at Shabbos meals. For the most part yeshiva rules are even stricter than Mormon rules.</p>
<p>I have been asked many times if I felt like I missed out on the &#8220;college experience&#8221;. I always answer, yes I did miss out on the college experience, thankfully. I am sure the BYU alumni feel the same way.</p>
<p>One more thing worth mentioning is the teammates that Davies leaves behind. I am sure they are disappointed, perhaps even upset. But they should also consider how lucky they are to play for a University that cares more about their morals and principles than making a buck. That is something we all can learn from.</p>

<p>The 2012 London Olympics have a gosh-awful logo and Iran wants to boycott the Olympics because of the logo. Except they don&#8217;t object to its awfulness, they have a much more &#8220;reasonable&#8221; objection.</p>
<p>It seems that in Iran, if you look at the logo, somehow you see the word Zion. And somehow this is offensive. I know. It sounds insane. But it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Even sillier is the fact that apparently it takes FOUR years to notice the word zion in the logo. Seeing as the logo was anounced (and criticized for its ridiculous design) FOUR YEARS AGO.</p>
<p>In a statement, a commonly used front for official proclomations in Iran said:<span id="more-3863"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>As internet documents have proved, using the word Zion in the logo of the 2012 Olympic Games is a disgracing action and against the Olympics&#8217; valuable mottos.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;There is no doubt that negligence of the issue from your side may affect the presence of some countries in the Games, especially Iran which abides by commitment to the values and principles.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I always like the Olympics because it gives countries a chance to set aside differences and compete. Part of that competition is trying to best your rival countries. It seems Iran wants no part of it.</p>
<p>Either that, or they are afraid of LOSING!</p>

<p>Auburn University won the BCS Championship Game to become the National College Football Champions. After their victory celebrating supporters of Auburn gathered where they always gather. They reveled Toomer&#8217;s Corner, home to 130 year old Oak trees. Part of the celebration includes draping the trees in toilet paper. Charming, I know. (No pun intended) And classy.</p>
<p>Auburn&#8217;s chief sports rival is Alabama. A 62 year old Alabama supporter had seen enough celebrating at Toomer&#8217;s Corner and decided to put an end to it. He used Spike 80df pesticide to poison the trees and they are almost certainly going to die. Yes, a 62 year old man. Yes, he killed 130 year old oak trees.<span id="more-3791"></span></p>
<p>As if this wasn&#8217;t idiotic enough, a man named Al from Dadeville called a local radio show and boasted that he was the one who poisoned the trees. The police found him and arrested him. Al&#8217;s real name is Harvey Almorn Updyke and he is in big trouble. He&#8217;s been charged with criminal mischief and is being held on $50,000 bail. The Feds are involved and those charges carry up to a 10 year prison sentence.</p>
<p>Sports are fun. But when it turn you into a crazy person they aren&#8217;t fun anymore.</p>
<p>And killing 130 year old trees is just idiotic. They take 130 years to grow back! That&#8217;s not a prank. That&#8217;s being an idiot.</p>
<p>Enjoy prison, Al from Dadeville&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/team-photo-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3776" title="team-photo-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/team-photo-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Compton is one of the toughest neighborhoods in Los Angeles. It has been ranked as the 17th most dangerous city in America. Gangs are a part of daily life in Compton. The streets are run by ex-cons, cons and future cons. Drugs and death pervade the very air.</p>
<p>Gang life is usually not a choice for folks growing up in these neighborhoods. It&#8217;s like being born into a family. You&#8217;re in because you&#8217;re born in. It is extremely difficult to break free from the gangs. But it can be done.</p>
<p>I think it is obvious that providing non-violent outlets for youth is an important tool for helping youths avoid the gang lifestyle. <span id="more-3775"></span>The problem is that most &#8220;outlets&#8221; don&#8217;t create the family feel, structure and sense of belonging that a gang provides. The exception to that is sports. Being on a team, especially a good team feeds the same hunger that a gang feeds. Unfortunately, sports teams are also run over with gangs. The teams represent the gangs. The winners assert dominance over the losing gang.</p>
<p>On a deeper level there is another flaw with most sports as an alternative to gang life. Sports don&#8217;t really demand etiquette and respect. Trash talking is part of the game. Then there is the violence. Basketball, soccer and football, the most popular &#8220;pick up&#8221; sports in SoCal are rough and tough games. There is jostling, tackling, fouls and much contact between players. One could say that sports feed into the violent gang culture to a degree.</p>
<p>That is why this BBC report on a Cricket team from Compton is extra remarkable. Cricket has pageantry, etiquette and respect. It is the ultimate gentleman&#8217;s game. Somehow, the sport has caught on in Compton. The team has toured across the world drawing rave reviews from more experienced cricket teams in real cricket countries.</p>
<p>The team has been somewhat successful in getting kids off the streets but they have higher goals. They want to build a cricket field in Compton. I wish them the best of luck.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/super-bowl-2011-try-2.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3725" title="superbowl 2011" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/super-bowl-2011-try-2-207x300.png" alt="" width="207" height="300" /></a>This Sunday, the most celebrated American tradition returns with its yearly dose of football. It&#8217;s the Super Bowl (TM). I know, I&#8217;m supposed to call it the &#8220;Big Game&#8221; or something nebulous like that, but I won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>For football fans, the Super Bowl is usually one of the most disappointing weeks of football. That&#8217;s because a team, OTHER THAN YOURS, wins the darn thing. But for non-football fans, the game is a yearly infusion of football and bits of entertainment spliced into 30 second spots called commercials.</p>
<p>This year, Fox is selling Super Bowl ads for about $2 million dollars a pop. It is the most watched television event every year and the cost of the commercial time creates a huge buzz surrounding the ads. Corporations dedicate millions of dollars to producing their Super Bowl ads and the ads live on far beyond the Super Bowl via YouTube and blogs inviting viewers to cast their votes as to their favorites.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Super Bowl is a huge opportunity for a company to generate buzz and market its products. Last year I wrote about the Pro-Life ad that was unnecessarily controversial (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/28/tim-tebows-pro-life-superbowl-ad-is-heartwarming-and-reckless/">Tim Tebow&#8217;s Pro-Life Super Bowl Ad is Heartwarming and Reckless</a> and then <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/07/retraction-tim-tebow-ad-was-harmless-not-reckless/">RETRACTION: Tim Tebow Ad WAS Harmless NOT Reckless</a>).<span id="more-3724"></span></p>
<p>Sometimes the ads that don&#8217;t get aired are even more interesting than the ads that do get aired.</p>
<p>This year several ads have been banned from airing during the Super Bowl. These bans are not from the FCC. They are self-censoring bans by Fox.</p>
<p>One ad is by Ashley Madison. This is a company that helps folks in committed relationships have an affair. Their slogan is &#8220;Life is short. Have an affair.&#8221; Their CEO is upset that his company&#8217;s ad was rejected it by Fox. He called it censorship. Well yes, it is censorship. The question is if it is warranted.</p>
<p>Another censored ad was an ad that could be viewed as residing on the completely opposite spectrum of morality. This ad was advising people to look to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_3:16" target="_blank">John 3:16</a> for inspiration. Fox rejected this ad because it contained &#8220;Religious Doctrine&#8221;. This is also censorship. The question is if it is warranted.</p>
<p>I think that both commercials are appropriate for Television. However, they are not appropriate for the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl is a family television program. It is watched by the same people who watch Saturday morning cartoons and PBS Kids. Ads that assume that the maturity and sophistication of the audience is over 15 years old are plainly inappropriate.</p>
<p>Ashley Madison can advertise on shows and programs that adults are the primary viewers. Children are not the audience that Ashley Madison wants to target and worse, children don&#8217;t have the maturity to deal with ads that may cause them to contemplate issues that are not appropriate for their demographic, like infidelity. An ad that tells viewers to look up John 3:16, which by the way, says that with Jesus you will be alright, the inference being that without Jesus you won&#8217;t, is not appropriate for children who think they are alright without Jesus because that is how their parents raised them. The Super Bowl is a family event and the ads should reflect that reality.</p>
<p>Personally, I find ads for Viagra and Cialis or other adult only products and services during sporting events offensive. These two ads are even worse. My suggestion for parents watching sporting events with their kids is simply not to watch commercials. First of all, you will spare them the sick consumerism of the West for a little while longer. But more importantly, the advertisers are not considering the effects of their ads of kids and sometimes the ads are just not appropriate for them. Do them and yourself a favor. Skip the ads.</p>
<p>How? Get a DVR. Or turn off the TV for the commercials. Or just have the kids engage in another activity aside from watching the commercials.</p>
<p>I think Fox is in the right for censoring some Super Bowl commercials. I wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing even more censorship for family programs like the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>And as a Ravens fan: Go Packers!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/power-balance1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3609" title="power balance" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/power-balance1.png" alt="" width="400" height="167" /></a>A few famous athletes wear Power Balance wrist bands on their wrists. Power Balance sells all kinds of products that are supposed to &#8220;react to the natural flow of the body&#8221; and increase athletic performance. How does this magic work? There is a special hologram that is on the wrist band or necklace which somehow does the magic.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.accc.gov.au/">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</a> conducted a study and found that the holograms do absolutely nothing. Shocking. Right?<span id="more-3607"></span></p>
<p>The company has fired back saying that they believe in their product and despite the claims of the scientists at the ACCC, many people believe in their product&#8217;s effectiveness.</p>
<p>I heard on the radio that the way they market their product is by pulling you very powerfully by the arm, you fall over, then they put on the bracelet and pull you again, this time much less powerfully, you don&#8217;t fall over and you are to conclude that the hologram really makes you stronger. (At least this was how it was described by Petros and Money who were subjected to this test.)</p>
<p>People are always looking for a quick fix. There are no shortcuts in life. If you want results you need to do the work. Holograms don&#8217;t make you stronger. Wrist bands and amulets don&#8217;t make you stronger either.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that these types of products are reminiscent of amulets and charms of the past. Usually associated with religion, these items were thought to bring luck or even the favor of God. The Torah prohibits these practices. Although tricksters have been fooling Jews and others into buying their miracle items despite the exhortations of the Torah. Now that religious miracles are not as reliable as they were in the past (read: frauds are more easily exposed), the snake oil salesmen have moved to athletes looking to gain an edge.</p>
<p>Reading stuff like this makes me a proud skeptic.</p>

		<title>New York Court of Appeal Ruling: Golf at Your Own Risk</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Golf-Tee.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3509 alignleft" title="Close-up of Golf Club and Golf Ball" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Golf-Tee-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="179" /></a>I was going to write my Entertainment Law Review article on this issue. (Instead I wrote about Cyberbullying)</p>
<p>A recreational golfer named Azad Anand was struck by an errant golf ball while he was retrieving his ball. He sued his golf partner, Anoop Kapoor for damages. Normally, if you strike someone negligently with a golf ball you are liable for damages. Similarly, if you negligently hit a hockey puck into someone&#8217;s face you are liable for damages.</p>
<p>However, when one is engaged in an organized athletic activity there is an assumption of risk. This means that the participants are aware that there is some inherent risk in playing the game and are willing to forfeit any potential damages.<span id="more-3508"></span></p>
<p>Cases of this nature arose as a result of injuries sustained during boxing matches, football games and swimming competitions. The golf case tested the assumption of risk issue to see if it would be extended to golf. Golf is not really a sport with inherent risks. There are not too many golf injuries and that is because golf is not an inherenrtly dangerous activity. The plaintiff claimed that negligence during an activity that is not inherently dangerous and is not an integral part of the game (ie errant balls) therefore he should be able to recover for neglignce. Apparenltly, the defendant did not yell the customary &#8220;fore&#8221; prior to hitting the ball. This could amount to negligence and with no assumption of risk the defendant would be on the hook for damages.</p>
<p>The lower court and the higher court agreed that there is an assumption of risk in a recreational game of golf. Thus, even though golf is not a dangerous sport, participants assume the risks of the dangers that are commonly associated with the sport.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a landmark ruling but it is important to observe the development of this area of law.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/1195435260847559291dagobert83_thumb.svg_.med_.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3348" title="thumb" src="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/1195435260847559291dagobert83_thumb.svg_.med_.png" alt="" width="180" height="107" /></a>Everyone who has studied the Talmud is familiar with the logical argument used throughout the Talmud called a &#8220;kal v&#8217;chomer&#8221; or kal vachomer. A kal v&#8217;chomer is the Talmud&#8217;s version of the a fortiori argument.</p>
<p>That is, if A is more advanced than B, if A can do X, B can certainly do X. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_fortiori_argument" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> uses this example: &#8220;If it has been established that a person is deceased, then one can, with equal or greater certainty, argue that the person is not breathing.&#8221;</p>
<p>When invoking the kal v&#8217;chomer in Talmud study, it is the opportune moment to utilize the familiar Talmudic sing-song as well as a &#8220;thumb dip&#8221; to emphasize your point. (Speaking of which, the thumb dip needs a wikipedia entry&#8230; no?)<span id="more-3346"></span></p>
<p>Anyway, the kal v&#8217;chomer is not considered a perfect argument by the Talmud. No punishments are able to be given as a result of a kal v&#8217;chomer.</p>
<p>The weakness of a kal v&#8217;chomer is mostly due to the lack of external information that could prove that A is not stronger than B for another reason.</p>
<p>This graphic demonstrates exactly why the kal v&#8217;chomer doesn&#8217;t always work&#8230;</p>
<p>Sports fans love trying to prove their team&#8217;s supremacy by using the kal v&#8217;chomer. Team A beat Team B and Team B beat Team C so Team A can certainly beat Team C. The problem is, this is a complete fallacy. There are matchup issues, injury issues, effort issues plus the element of luck.</p>
<p>The graphic shows how there are no kal v&#8217;chomer&#8217;s in the NFL. As you go clockwise, the first team has defeated the second team, thus, imperically demonstrating that anyone can win on &#8220;Any Given Sunday&#8221;.</p>

<p><em>This post has been crossposted to DovBear &#8211; more discussion there: </em><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/11/wwajd-what-would-jew-do.html" target="_blank"><em>DovBear</em></a></p>
<p>Sports-talk radio is abuzz over an incident that occurred a few weeks ago at a High-School football game in Connecticut.</p>
<p>Southington vs Manchester was tied at 14 at halftime. Some time during the first half, a Manchester player dropped his armband with the entire Manchester playbook and the codewords for each of those plays. A Southington player picked it up. The player gave the armband to his coach.</p>
<p>The coach used the information on the armband to stymie the Manchester offense and eventually won the game 28-14.</p>
<p>It seems to me that High-School sports are competitive as well as educational. This was a failed opportunity to educate on fairness, sportsmanship and winning the &#8220;right way&#8221;. But what of the competition aspect? Is this ethical? Is this cheating? Is there a space between cheating and unethical behavior? All good questions.<span id="more-3272"></span></p>
<p>The biggest question for me is, how do we treat sports? Meaning, sports have their own rules, do the rules of the real world apply during the game? Or are the real world rules suspended during the game and as long as you follow the rules of the game you are doing the right thing?</p>
<p>So, what would do you think? What would you do?</p>
<p>(The Coach was suspended for a game)</p>
<p>(And his brother plays for the Patriots, home of the cheating coaches)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/s-NFL-CONCUSSIONS-large.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3006" title="concussion" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/s-NFL-CONCUSSIONS-large.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="190" /></a>The National Football League is cracking down on violent hits. Following a Sunday where several players suffered devastating hits to their heads and a season that has seen a tick up in concussions, the NFL issued several fines of $50,000 or more to players who &#8220;led with their head&#8221; into another player&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>You might think that the helmet protects a player&#8217;s head, but it is just as effective as a weapon. Launching one&#8217;s helmet into another player&#8217;s head could be an effective way of breaking up a play but it also can cause a head injury of a serious magnitude. The NFL is trying to protect its players and &#8220;head shots&#8221; will be a suspendable offense from here on out.</p>
<p>Football purists aren&#8217;t happy. They think that if players are not allowed to use their helmets as weapons on the playing field the game is diluted and weak. Real football is dangerous and pretending otherwise will ruin the game.</p>
<p>Of course this is a pathetically misinformed argument. <span id="more-3119"></span>NFL players are people too. Head trauma does not heal like a torn ACL or turf toe. It can cause health problems for the duration of the person&#8217;s life, memory loss, early onset of Alzheimers, a shorter life expectancy. See Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s article in the New Yorker from last Fall: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/10/19/091019fa_fact_gladwell" target="_blank">OFFENSIVE PLAY</a>. The dangers are real and scary. Protecting other human beings should override concerns (that are not even valid) that the game will be diluted. It&#8217;s a GAME! These are human beings! Incredible.</p>
<p>I love the NFL, but I hate the head shots. Violence makes me cringe and its no different on the Football field. I would love to see less violence in the NFL.</p>
<p>There is a legal issue as well. When someone engages in professional sports there is an &#8220;assumption of risk&#8221;. Participants waive their right to recover for damages suffered during the game, but only if the harms were caused as a result of behavior that is risky and inherent to the game. It could be argued that &#8220;head shots&#8221; are not inherent to the game of football. I know that I have played football without head shots&#8230;</p>
<p>There is a Jewish angle here too. I went to a Yeshiva High School (Ner Israel Mechina High School) where many of  the rules of the school were determined by Torah principles. We played football most Saturday nights and we mostly played tackle football. We used no pads or protection; just our resilient teenage bodies. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries.</p>
<p>We were told that it was not &#8220;against the rules&#8221; to play tackle football but the Rosh Yeshiva (Rabbinic Leader of the school &#8211; a wise, saintly and holy man, R&#8217; Yaakov Weinberg) held that playing tackle football <em>was not permissible</em>. He explained that tackle football is a sport where part of the game requires one person to physically maul another person. In his view it was against Torah principles to participate in a game that requires one to hit and potentially harm another person.</p>
<p>We played anyway, and we really tried not hurt anyone, but the lesson stuck. How can one play a game that makes you hurt another person? Contrast that with this quote from Jerome Harrison (fined $75,000 for 2 devastating hits):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221;I don&#8217;t want to injure anybody, there&#8217;s a big difference between being hurt and being injured. You get hurt, you shake it off and come back the next series or the next game. <em>I try to hurt people</em>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Trying to hurt people? The game can be played beautifully without &#8220;trying to hurt people&#8221;. And perhaps more importantly, trying to hurt people is not the right way to treat fellow human beings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/i.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2905" title="Michael Vick" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/i-300x217.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="217" /></a>Bill Simmons (aka The Sports Guy) wrote a recent column about Micheal Vick and his comeback. (<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmonsnfl2010/101001" target="_blank">Rooting for Michael Vick</a>)</p>
<p>Quick background: Mike Vick was the most tantalizing NFL football player I have ever seen. (Some recent highlights: <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/09000d5d81adb579/Week-3-Michael-Vick-Highlights" target="_blank">here</a>) He was a quarterback who threw laser beam passes that look like they were traveling at the speed of light on a rope. He ran faster than anyone else on the field. He could put on the brakes instantly and change direction before a defender realized what happened. In short, Mike Vick highlights are like Michael Jordan highlights. Incredible.</p>
<p>Then it all came crashing down. Vick was convicted on Federal Dog Fighting charges. Vick and his friends raised fighting dogs and fought them. They tortured dogs. They killed dogs. For his crimes he sat in prison for a couple years. He was suspended by the NFL. He was bankrupt. Many thought his career was over.</p>
<p>After being released from jail and then a halfway house, Vick has become an ambassador for animal rights and an (almost) model citizen since his release. Vick played a little football last year but was a third string quarterback on a good team. This year he began as a backup, but following an injury to the starting quarterback, Vick became the starter.</p>
<p>Vick played better than ever. His athleticism has not deteriorated and his maturity as a player make him a better player than he was before. People began to talk about a &#8220;Hollywood Ending&#8221; to the Vick saga. Vick had the support of many of his previous detractors.<span id="more-2901"></span></p>
<p>Simmons writes that Vick emerged as the &#8220;feel good story&#8221; of the NFL. But his wife disagrees. The Sports Gal cannot forgive Vick. The Sports Gal says that if you love dogs, you cannot possibly forgive Vick. Sport Guy retorts that Vick did everything humanly possibly to pay for his crimes, apologize and rehabilitate his life. He lost EVERYTHING. He said he was genuinely sorry. He is fixing what he broke. Vick is a real Restorative Justice story. And Bill Simmons forgives him. Mrs. Simmons loves dogs too much to forgive Vick.</p>
<p>The article is a great read and I recommend reading it.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about a discussion in our Restorative Justice Seminar about forgiveness, apologies and their role in Restorative Justice.</p>
<p>Restorative Justice seeks to fix what was broken when a crime is committed. It calls for all who have a stake in the crime to do their best to restore those who were harmed by the crime. Usually it is the victims, the community and the perpetrator.</p>
<p>Do criminals need to apologize for their crimes to be restored? Do victims need to forgive for the criminals to be restored?</p>
<p>Some people think it is vital that the criminal apologize. How can the victim forgive without an apology? Others say that victims should never and will never forgive their attackers, so why apologize? Others say that apologies that are required are not real. Yet others say that even if the victim does not forgive their attacker, the community should forgive.</p>
<p>Some participants in the discussion mentioned crimes that were perpetrated against them. Some of those people said they would never forgive their attacker. Others said they forgave their attacker and it made them feel better.</p>
<p>During the discussion an idea crystallized in my head. It seems to me that people can be divided into two disparate categories. There are forgivers and non-forgivers.</p>
<p>The Forgivers are willing to forgive anyone. They give everyone second chances. And third and fourth chances too. The Forgivers hate retribution and vengeance. The Forgivers will only punish to protect others but not because the criminal needs to be punished to pay for his crime. Forgivers do not need an apology to forgive. They have already forgiven.</p>
<p>The Non-Forgivers do not forgive. No amount of apology makes an impact. The apology cannot fix anything. Words are cheap. I&#8217;m sorry doesn&#8217;t change the past. Non-Forgivers want criminals to pay for their crimes. Non-Forgivers &#8220;move on&#8221; without forgiveness.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there is anything &#8220;wrong&#8221; with Non-Forgivers. Nor do I think Forgivers are &#8220;better&#8221;. Both have advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions, but I think these categories cover almost everyone.</p>
<p>When it comes to Vick, those who are Non-Forgivers AND Dog Lovers can&#8217;t forgive him. If you&#8217;re a Non-Forgiver who doesn&#8217;t love dogs then you don&#8217;t need to forgive Vick.</p>
<p>So it turns out that it would impossible and almost idiotic to require an apology for Restorative Justice seeing as it plays little role in the healing process. Forgivers don&#8217;t need it and Non-Forgivers don&#8217;t care for it.</p>
<p>One final note: In Judaism an apology is not for the victim. Victims are expected to forgive. In order for God to pardon a sin using the Teshuva process (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/06/essay-what-is-teshuva-repentance-and-how-does-it-work-in-judaism/">Essay: What is Teshuva (repentance) and How Does It Work in Judaism?</a>) the one who suffered the harm must forgive. Orthodox Jews make a proclamation every year just before Yom Kippur that they forgive anyone and everyone that may have hurt them<sup><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/06/michael-vick-bill-simmons-forgiveness-and-restorative-justice/#footnote_0_2901" id="identifier_0_2901" class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link" title="Incredibly, even if the forgiver does not &ldquo;mean it&rdquo;, the perpetrator is still &ldquo;forgiven&rdquo; by God under the halachic precept of &ldquo;things of the heart have no probative value when they contradict one&rsquo;s words&rdquo;.">1</a></sup>. Forgiveness is basically a given. However, an apology is valued by what it accomplished for the perpetrator. Saying &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221; is good for the person who did something wrong because it is an acknowledgment of wrongdoing which is necessary for his personal change. Even if the apology is required, it can make all the difference in the world for the one who expresses the apology is rehabilitating their life.</p>
<p>For a truly heartwarming story of forgiveness see this video:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/5059de_stallworth_08292010.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2883" title="donte stallworth" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/5059de_stallworth_08292010-300x261.jpg" alt="Photo: AP" width="270" height="235" /></a>On the morning of March 14 2009, NFL Wide Receiver Donté Stallworth was driving his Bentley when he struck and killed a pedestrian. Stallworth admitted that he had been drinking the previous night and was allegedly still intoxicated at the time of the accident. The pedestrian was not in a crosswalk and Stallworth was only driving 10 MPH over the speed limit of 40 MPH.</p>
<p>Stallworth was very apologetic and sympathetic to the family. Stallworth wished that the family should avoid having to go to court to relive the trauma of losing their loved one and happily settled out of court in a financial agreement and made a guilty plea to avoid a criminal case.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=lc-stallworthsecondchance081210" target="_blank">Yahoo! Sports</a>, Stallworth would have likely been found innocent at trial. <span id="more-2882"></span>However, Stallworth wanted to avoid trial for the sake of the family and to do what he thought was morally right and thus accepted the guilty plea. A friend said: “His biggest concern was for the gentleman’s daughter. He wanted [the victim's] family to know he was remorseful.” His lawyers tried to convince him not to move forward with his plea. He did it anyway. He was in jail for 24 days among other punishments.</p>
<p>For his off the field misbehavior, Stallworth was suspended by the NFL for one year without pay. In his time off, Stallworth spent his time pursuing more meaningful outlets, like politics. Stallworth is an avid reader and has a subscription to The Economist, a more highbrow publication than what most jocks are assumed to be reading. To anyone who will listen, Stallworth says: “Any little decision you make will have a subsequent reaction, be cognizant of your decisions.”</p>
<p>It seems that Donté Stallworth has used his experience to improve his life, the life of those who lay in the wake of his error and the lives of anyone &#8220;who will listen&#8221;.</p>
<p>Stallworth was drinking with a friend that night. He was drinking with NFL Wide Receiver, Braylon Edwards. Edwards has had a spotty NFL career. He has underperformed and been fined several times for various infractions. In March 2009 he was drinking with Stallworth in the incident that led to a death but he was not charged in the incident.</p>
<p>Edwards must have seen how Stallworth reacted to his crime. In true Restorative Justice fashion, Stallworth took ownership of his actions and made it up to the victim&#8217;s family as best he could. Stallworth has tried to turn his life into a more positive light for others.</p>
<p>Yet, this morning, Braylon Edwards was picked up by NYS Police with a .16 BAC (twice the legal limit) with two fellow teammates as passengers in his vehicle.</p>
<p>Yes. Braylon Edwards is a moron. He saw his friend kill a man while under the influence of alcohol. Yet, he puts his own life, the lives of his two teammates and the lives of every other driver on the road at 5:15 this morning in danger.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to learn from our experiences. Experiences are supposed to be better learning tools than book learning.</p>
<p>It seems Braylon Edwards is experience learning disabled&#8230;</p>

<p><em>This post has been crossposted to DovBear &#8211; </em><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/09/ncaa-and-contemporary-orthodox-judaism.html"><em>The NCAA and Contemporary Orthodox Judaism</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Last year, Jeremiah Masoli was the quarterback for the Oregon Ducks. He got into some trouble with the law and committed second degree burglary and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. The Ducks cut him from the team and Masoli transferred to Ole Miss.</p>
<p>At first he was considered a transfer and would be forced to sit out the year. He appealed and won the appeal and is now eligible to play for Ole Miss. Apparently, the NCAA does not feel that breaking the law warrants a suspension.</p>
<p>For the last five years, the NCAA has been investigating Reggie Bush and benefits his family received from a potential agent. In finding that Bush broke NCAA rules by accepting gifts (like a house for his family) the NCAA sanctioned USC <span id="more-2808"></span>by taking away scholarships, banning them from bowl games and taking away personal awards. Apparently, the NCAA feels that breaking ITS rules warrants severe punishment.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Rabbi Weil wrote a wonderful article on how Orthodox Judaism has morphed into caring more about its own rules than the rules of society and the laws of our country. (Link: <a href="http://bit.ly/aWdl9X">OU.org</a>) We concentrate so much on the rituals and customs of Orthodox Judaism that set us apart from other religions that sometimes the basics of citizenship get ignored. It is especially egregious because our law has many of those same laws!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost just the NCAA. It seems like we care more about our own rules than the laws of the land. This is wrong.</p>
<p>As we begin a New Year, I think we need to recommit ourselves to the universal laws of good all the while celebrating those laws that make us different. We can afford to ignore neither.</p>

Dugan says to a player of his who is crying (and happens to be a woman) that &#8220;There&#8217;s no crying in baseball&#8221;.</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;ve made a censored version of the video and embedded it below if you have no idea what I am talking about.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never quite understood why there is no crying in baseball, nor why this line is so famous. It doesn&#8217;t even make any sense to me. And yet, here we are. Everyone knows there&#8217;s no crying in baseball and no one knows why.</p>
<p>Try telling Jim Joyce and Armando Galarraga that there is no crying in baseball.<span id="more-2511"></span></p>
<p>Yesterday, Galarraga was one out away from Baseball Lore. He had pitched to 26 batters and sent each one of those batters back to the dugout. He was one out from the 21st  (recorded) Perfect Game in Major League Baseball History. Then this happened:</p>
<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=5245489">Click here to see the debacle</a> unless you&#8217;ve already seen the play. (I would embed the video but ESPN has disabled embedding for that clip and MLB does not allow embedding of their videos and they take all youtube.com videos down, you know, God forbid, people would share baseball videos and expand their fandom&#8230;)</p>
<p>To explain: The 27th batter was out. The umpire called him safe. He apologized. But he was tearful. <strong><em>WHAT</em></strong><strong>? </strong><strong>THERE&#8217;S NO CRYING IN BASEBALL!</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, I am not here to talk about crying. I am here to talk about fixing mistakes.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball reviewed the play and agreed that it was an erroneous call.</p>
<p>So they should just fix it right? Call the 27th batter out and give Galarraga his perfect game.</p>
<p>Sorry. No can do. If a human error decides a game or denies someone their place in history it is too late. There is nothing that can be done.</p>
<p>Art imitates life. So does sport. When we make a mistake in life there is nothing we can do to undo the mistake. There is no crtl-z (cmd-z for us mac people), there is no instant replay and reversals. We live with our decisions.</p>
<p>One would expect that to be the same way a Divine Being would treat mankind. If you act, you suffer the consequences. Perhaps there may some mercy or amnesty, but your actions are still done. They cannot be undone.</p>
<p>In Judaism there is a concept called Teshuva. This is often mistranslated as &#8220;repentance&#8221;. That is not teshuva. Teshuva is return. Going through the process of teshuva one can return to the exact spot they were at before the act. It is a true return. The physical act is done and cannot be undone. But the spiritual effects of the action can be undone with teshuva.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no crying in baseball and there is no teshuva in baseball either.</p>

(Again. Remember? <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/18/the-zen-master-speaks-on-curses-karma-and-mitzvahs/">The Zen Master Speaks on Curses, Karma and Mitzvahs</a>)</p>
<p>When asked about the Arizona Immigration Law &#8211; state Senate Bill 1070, by ESPN.com columnist J.A. Adande, Jackson raised a few eyebrow. In fact he raised enough eyebrows that a protest is planned for tonight&#8217;s game at Staples Center in Downtown LA.</p>
<p>The LA Times has a full report here: <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/05/activists-protest-lakers-coach-phil-jackons-comments-on-arizonas-new-immigration-law.html">Activists protest Lakers Coach Phil Jackson&#8217;s comments on Arizona&#8217;s new immigration law</a></p>
<p>What did Jackson say that set off the protesters?<span id="more-2475"></span></p>
<p>During their Playoffs Series against the San Antonio Spurs, the Suns wore Jerseys that paid tribute to the Latino community by tweaking the name of the team from Suns to Los Suns. That this is somehow a strong political statement is a stretch in my mind. Some people (including the players) felt that by wearing Los Suns on their jersey it was somehow a protest against the law. I don&#8217;t see it that way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Adande asked Jackson what he thought about the Suns political statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>First Jackson, who has showed lefty leanings in the past, indicated he had no problem with the controversial state Senate Bill 1070.</p>
<p><em>“Am I crazy, or am I the only one that heard [the legislature] say ‘we just took the United States immigration law and adapted it to our state,’”</em> Jackson said.</p>
<p>I told him they usurped the federal law.</p>
<p><em>“It’s not usurping, it’s just copying it is what they said they did, and then they gave it some teeth to be able to enforce it,”</em> Jackson said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I feel exactly like Jackson. Am I crazy?</p>
<p>When the bill was passed the NY Times had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Arizona is the first state to demand that immigrants meet <strong>federal requirements</strong> to carry identity documents legitimizing their presence on American soil. (Full article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html" target="_blank">here</a>.) (emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p>The law just enforces a Federal Requirement. Uncle Righteous (that&#8217;s Coach Jackson&#8217;s other nickname) is just standing up for Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>So Jackson is right. Yet the law has set off a firestorm. Why? I can think of a lot of reasons. But it seems misguided to take out your anger on Phil Jackson, or even the state of Arizona! This a Federal Regulation!</p>
<p>Anyway, I digress. There are two things I want to mention.</p>
<p>First, Adande makes a foolish assumption. He assumes that if a man is a Democrat or a liberal then he falls in line and supports every single policy of fellow Democrats. The money quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>That was surprising to hear coming from a man who not only supported Bill Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination, he wore a Bradley campaign pin on his suit during games.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is it surprising? Each issue has its merits and demerits. Why must we be pigeonholed once we hold one way in one issue that now in every other issue our opinion is pre-determined!? This bothers me a lot. Jackson has every right to feel one way on one issue and side with &#8220;liberals&#8221;  and on other issues side with &#8220;conservatives&#8221;. If not, we cease to think and become party line robots.</p>
<p>Finally, sports and politics don&#8217;t mix. To me that means that an athlete or sportswriter or coach can have an opinion but it is not nearly as valuable as their relative expertise on sports. Is Jackson influential in political spheres? Absolutely not. So why protest his statements? Let the guy coach basketball and ignore everything else that he says.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I do&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/kt4t52-b78569816z.120091114194514000gbdkqnnv.21.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2406" title="Toby Gerhart" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/kt4t52-b78569816z.120091114194514000gbdkqnnv.2-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="203" /></a>One of the best college football running backs in recent memory is Toby Gerhart.</p>
<p>Gerhart put the Stanford Cardinal football team on his shoulders and carried them to prominence for the first time since John Elway led them to prominence 25 years ago.</p>
<p>His college statistics are astounding: 1871 yards and 27 touchdowns last season. His combine numbers are impressive: 4.50 in the 40 yard dash and a 38 inch vertical leap.</p>
<p>Sounds like a sure-fire first round draft pick&#8230;</p>
<p>So why are scouts projecting Gerhart will be picked in the second round of the upcoming NFL Draft?<span id="more-2405"></span></p>
<p>Gerhart thinks it may be due to the fact that he is white.</p>
<p>In the NFL, running backs are black. And Gerhart is white.</p>
<p>In his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“One team I interviewed with asked me about being a white running back,” Gerhart says. “They asked if it made me feel entitled, or like I felt I was a poster child for white running backs. I said, ‘No, I’m just out there playing ball. I don’t think about that.’ I didn’t really know what to say.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>In the words of a scout:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“He’ll be a great second-round pickup for somebody, but I guarantee you if he was the exact same guy – but he was black – he’d go in the first round for sure,” the scout said. “You could make a case that he’s a </em><em>Steven Jackson</em><em>-type – doesn’t have blazing speed but he’s strong and powerful and versatile.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Of course there are some legitimate concerns about Gerhart&#8217;s running style and durability and those are factors in his draft placement as well.</p>
<p>Is it racism when a white football player is discriminated against? It can be. When the white person is the minority and the white person is given negative treatment it could be considered racism. And as far as NFL players and specifically NFL running backs go, white is definitely a minority.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: normal;">I can&#8217;t say whether this case is racism or not. Whether it is perception or reality is impossible to know. But either way I am rooting for Gerharts success. The more stereotypes that can be broken down the better our society will be.</span></span></em></p>

That means 10 weeks of sporadic games until someone takes home the Larry O&#8217;Brien Trophy and gets to spritz champagne all over themselves.</p>
<p>Of course, the &lt;sarcasm&gt; Supreme King Master of the Basketball Universe, His Royal Heiness LeBron James is expected to win it all and take his team to the &#8220;Promised Land&#8221; and we will all fawn all over his super-human ability and charisma &lt;end sarcasm&gt;. That is until he reminds us that it is all about the money in the off-season, because LeBron is a free agent this summer.</p>
<p>I have had my criticisms of LeBron in the past. <span id="more-2377"></span>In <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/02/athletes-as-role-models/">Athletes as Role Models?</a> I reminded everyone that athletes are just athletes. They are not people worth looking up to. And in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/09/21/teamwork-important-in-sports-more-important-in-life/">Teamwork: Important in Sports, More Important in Life</a> I pointed out that for an athlete who is supposed to be such a team player, the video of LeBron with his teammates disappearing is a conflicting (and wrong) message.</p>
<p>The latest gripe I have with LeBron is even more serious. LeBron owns a marketing company call LRMR. In the NBA a marketing company is a conglomorate that tries to woo potential clients from the college ranks to sign with them to represent the athlete&#8217;s interest. The agency will market the player as a commodity to teams to negotiate salary as well to corporations to contract endorsement deals.</p>
<p>The business is shady enough as it is. College athletes are not allowed to accept payment or gifts. Marketing agencies will use 3rd parties to win over athletes in the hope that the 3rd party will control which agency the athlete chooses. Is it legal? probably. Nevertheless, it is definitiely shady. But when an athlete, especially an athlete with the influence of LeBron enters the fray, what was shady is now borderline unethical. If an athlete controls other athlete&#8217;s decisions by controlling their contract negotionations and endorsement deals, that is a level of control that is, in my view, wrong.</p>
<p>But maybe LeBron is such a sterling character that he would never dream of using his influence to contol athletes?</p>
<p>Sorry, but <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-lebronwall041310" target="_blank">according to this Yahoo News item</a>, LeBron is already working his magic on the most highyl touted NBA prospect since LeBron, John Wall.</p>
<p>Just another reason I don&#8217;t like LeBron&#8230;</p>

<p>To summarize: My opinion is that athletes are just athletes. They excel one general area of life, competitive athletic ability, and that is the only thing worth looking up to them for. One can admire work ethic, focus, quick thinking, pure athleticism of their favorite athletes, but to learn about sportsmanship, common courtesy or morality from athletes is asinine. That is not what they are known for, and usually it is for a reason. There are much more appropriate role models for those things and our job is to look to those people as role models and not athletes. When it comes to children, parents must teach their children who their role models should be as opposed to letting athletes teach their kids about morals and ethics.</p>
<p>There is one general exception. When an athlete clearly excels in another area of life and has experience in that area of life then even the athlete can become a role model. Or more precisely, the person is a role model who happens to be an athlete.</p>
<p>Take Tim Tebow for example. Tebow has spent signficant time and effort doing good work and rising above his athletic stardom and become a star of his religion. He clearly has a set of morals that guide his life and is more than just an athlete. He is a missionary and an athlete. Tebow is a worthy role model who happens to be an athlete and being a succesful athlete has given him a greater audience. Tebow&#8217;s greater audience gives him more oportunity to be that role model and that is a good thing. Tebow is using his star power to express his opinion on abortion. We can agree or disagree with the message but Tebow is a messenger whose words carry some weight. As a role model, Tebow&#8217;s fame as an athlete goes a long way to increasing his influence and impact.</p>
<p>Recently, another athlete who could have been just like Tebow in that respect bowed out of competitive sports. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4849432" target="_blank">Oakland Athletics prospect Grant Desme left his baseball dreams behind to enter the priesthood</a>. Projected as an above average Major League player, Desme bows out of the game he loves, for the God he loves more. Desme was going to be a good baseball player. But now he hopes to be a great priest. Instead of using his baseball related fame to teach and be that rare athlete worth treating like a role model, Desme leaves sports and is devoting his life to his religion.</p>
<p>Two athletes with higher moral standards and two different approaches.</p>
<p>Who will have a greater impact, Tebow or Desme?</p>
<p>Which is the better path? The athlete who uses his fame to be a super role model to millions of adoring fans? Or the former athlete who gave it all up to pursue a &#8220;higher calling&#8221;?</p>
<p>Tebows audience will be much bigger. But Desme&#8217;s potential is greater because he can devote more time to personal growth.</p>
<p>I find this question very interesting. What do you think?</p>

<p>Most Olympic skaters wear pretty outrageous costumes for their routines during the Olympics and Weir is known for his &#8220;over-the-top&#8221; designs. His outfit was supposed to have a small trim of fox fur on the left shoulder. After pressure from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CE8QFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPeople_for_the_Ethical_Treatment_of_Animals&amp;ei=SBpjS--hBoj6sgPimJ26AQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHhCDpHoZDIHB8ZzOR-fCOofKWrfQ&amp;sig2=M2urhTxXWqrF_6V8xADhfA" target="_blank">PETA</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CD0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.friendsofanimals.org%2F&amp;ei=5F5jS-O7JofMsQOH9bSdAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBMBAtprM56EfFUxyOHA8EM22RJQ&amp;sig2=HRBnu-zu7UwLejneX_tDyA" target="_blank">Friends of Animals</a> and hate mail as well as threats from less professional activists, Weir has acquiesced and is wearing a faux-fox fur in the place of the original, real fur trim.</p>
<p>What was interesting to me was the way Weir handled the fur wearing issue.<span id="more-2066"></span></p>
<p>Weir responded that wearing fur is a personal choice and he understands the point of view of the activists, he just doesn&#8217;t agree. He feels that there are more important causes to be concerned with like homelessness and Haiti relief.</p>
<p>He closed his statement with a great line:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“I hope these activists can understand that my decision to change my costume is in no way a victory for them, but a draw,” Weir said in his statement. “I am not changing in order to appease them, but to protect my integrity and the integrity of the Olympic Games as well as my fellow competitors.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Two things struck me after reading his statement.</p>
<p>1) There <em>are </em>more important causes than animal rights. They involve <em>people</em>! How much money has been spent by PETA or other activists? Is it a good use of resources? I don&#8217;t have a definitive answer, but I am leaning in a certain direction.</p>
<p>2) Isn&#8217;t Weir saying that he is &#8220;giving in&#8221; to a bully? He doesn&#8217;t agree but he wants the activists off his back. Children deal with bullies all the time and the instructions for dealing with bullies varies. Some say that children should &#8220;stand up&#8221; to the bully and others say &#8220;give in&#8221; to the bully. Weir is &#8220;giving in&#8221;. Obviously, he doesn&#8217;t want to take a stand. But now, activists are emboldened to bully more people.</p>
<p>It reminds me of something I wrote about last year in a post called <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/11/political-discrimination/" target="_blank">Political Discrimination</a>. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/11/political-discrimination/" target="_blank">Prop 8 opponents were using Google Maps and public record to find people who supported Prop 8 and they demonstrated a their homes and places of work, oftentimes distrutpting business and causing damage.</a></p>
<p>Too many bullies make for a less peaceful world. Let&#8217;s try and use other means of communication and activism and avoid bullying to get our message out.</p>

<p>The most well-known athlete in America might be Tim Tebow.</p>
<p>Tebow is possibly the most celebrated, successful college football player of all time. He was a 2 time national champion with the Florida Gators and a Heisman Trophy winner. His success, as well as his  good looks and supernatural physique has made him a household name across the United States. Oh, there is one more thing, Tebow is the son of missionaries who is very religious and (at this point) celibate.</p>
<p>Tebow has used his star power to advocate for Christianity. He spent a couple of summers working with missionaries in the Far East and has always been vocal about his religiousness. Tim Tebow is an athlete who is using his star power to make a difference in the world. We may not agree with his message, but he is certainly a better role model than felon <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CEAQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2010%2F01%2F14%2FAR2010011403502.html&amp;ei=JMJhS5GMKpGksgPl5YWtCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQj1dgWYUUJBPZlV0jJbkt1RJElg&amp;sig2=NjTszozIJBn6w9LkB9eQ0A" target="_blank">Gilbert Arenas</a> or even <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/02/athletes-as-role-models/" target="_blank">LeBron James</a>.<span id="more-2067"></span></p>
<p>During the upcoming Super Bowl, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/tim-tebow-super-bowl-ad-cbs-air-controversial/story?id=9667638" target="_blank">Tebow will be featured in a $2.6 Million ad for a strong Pro-Life Organization called Focus on the Family</a>. This has set off a firestorm of reactions from groups that oppose Focus in the Famliy, like the National Organization for Women (don&#8217;t you love these names?) who do not approve the message of the ad. Additionally, advocate groups like PETA are up in arms because they have been denied Superbowl air time for their causes.</p>
<p>Honestly, the reason CBS approved this ad are probably related to the economy. IF you&#8217;re willing to pay $2.6 Million for an ad in the economy &#8211; they&#8217;ll take your money.</p>
<p>What is interesting to me about all this are the circumstances of Tim Tebow&#8217;s birth. In the ad Tim is expected to tell the story of his mother&#8217;s pregnancy. Mrs. Tebow became very ill during a mission to the Philippines and was advised to terminate the pregnancy to save her life. She ignored the doctor, Tim was born and Mrs. Tebow survived.</p>
<p>First, Jewish Law does not share the same views as Christian Law on abortion. In a situation where the mother&#8217;s life is in danger, many traditional authorities hold that  the mother MUST abort the pregnancy. There is an assumption that fundamentalist Christians and Orthodox Jews agree on abortion. That is just not true.</p>
<p>Second, even those that hold that abortion is immoral and should never be allowed, is this a wholesome message? To ignore a doctor&#8217;s strong recommendation? Isn&#8217;t reckless? Don&#8217;t we look at <a href="http://www.lisamcpherson.org/">Scientology</a> with disdain when a life is lost because of their refusal to see a doctor? What if Mrs. Tebow lost her life in the pregnancy and Tim dies before birth?</p>
<p>It seems that advocating for the sanctity of life is a fair cause to support, but advocating in a manner that breeds recklessness&#8230; That seems irresponsible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><div id="attachment_2044" style="width: 217px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/500894041.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2044" title="Phil Jackson" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/50089404-207x300.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Getty Images</p></div>
<p>A very interesting news item came my way today.</p>
<p>Last Friday night, The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Hoops-Spiritual-Lessons-Hardwood/dp/1401308813/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1263853197&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Zen Master, Phil Jackson</a>, Head Coach of the Los Angeles Lakers Head Coach, was asked about the Los Angeles Clippers. It seems that the Clippers are cursed.</p>
<p>A near perpetual resident of the cellar in the NBA standings, the Clippers have been blessed with plenty of very high draft choices. In the NBA high draft choices are the best way to build a team. The problem for the Clippers has been their draft selections have been huge busts. Some were plagued by injury, some ended up as NBA role players and others were just terrible choices.</p>
<p>Last week the latest Clippers draft pick, selected first overall, Blake Griffin underwent season ending surgery after sitting out the first half of the season hoping to get into playing shape.</p>
<p>So, the media asked Phil Jackson: Do you believe in curses?.</p>
<p>Phil&#8217;s response?</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="more-2043"></span></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/12335/phil-jackson-no-clipper-curse-just-donald-karma" target="_blank">As reported by J. A. Adande on the Truehoop blog:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Jackson said before the Lakers played the Clippers Friday night. &#8220;I&#8217;m of that generation that believes in karma. I do think there is karma in effect, ultimately. But I can&#8217;t proclaim anybody else&#8217;s karma. That&#8217;s their own making. If you do a good mitzvah [a Jewish term for an act of kindness], maybe you can eliminate some of those things. You think Sterling&#8217;s done enough mitzvahs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another reporter replied that Sterling is a major humanitarian (at least if you believe the ads Sterling has placed in the Los Angeles Times over the years).</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, but how about all those other incidents?&#8221; Jackson said.</p>
<p>Sterling has had his share of lawsuits brought against him, most notably a civil suit that in November resulted in him having to pay a record $2.725 million to settle a suit that claimed he discriminated against African-Americans, Hispanics and families with children in the apartment buildings he owns.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So Phil doesn&#8217;t believe in curses but his does believe in Karma and the power of a mitzvah to change Karma. I think I agree. Doing good in our world creates good energy in our world. The more good energy that is created, the better things may turn out.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it is determinative, but I do think it makes a difference. Whether that is the answer to the Clippers woes I would not claim to know.</p>
<p>But what of Mr. Sterling?</p>
<p>I have two issues with Mr. Sterling.</p>
<p>1) Ads in the LA Times tooting your horn? You need to tell people how much charity you give? It may be a mitzvah to give charity, but it is no mitzvah to publicize it. In fact the highest level of charity is &#8220;matan b&#8217;seyser&#8221;, giving in secret, without anyone knowing. Mr. Sterling, you could do better than to take out expensive ads telling us how great you are. Just be great and we will figure it out on our own.</p>
<p>2)  On this Martin Luther King Day, I think it is time to call out Mr. Sterling for his discrimination against minorities. Bigots like him, prevent Dr. King&#8217;s dream from becoming a reality. A dream that I share with him. So Mr. Sterling, change your ways or risk the effect of more bad karma&#8230;</p>
<p><em>I know that love is ultimately the only answer to mankind&#8217;s problems. And I&#8217;m going to talk about it everywhere I go.</em> &#8211; Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><div id="attachment_1744" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1744 " title="peace love" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/2256238213_6d7188379c-300x199.jpg" alt="Photo: Flickr/cortniedee." width="210" height="139" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: Flickr/cortniedee.</p></div>
<p>A few days ago a photo was posted on <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">Twitter</a> by the <a href="http://twitter.com/NBA" target="_blank">NBA</a>. Somehow, this photo has been on my mind since I saw it.</p>
<p>In sports, two teams oppose each other under the pretense that they are enemies. Their fans may even dislike one another, (see Celtics / Lakers, Yankees / Red Sox, UNC / Duke, etc,) but in the end, athletes are mostly friendly with each other. Even when athletes get upset or physical with one another, they can remain friends (see Kobe Bryant and Ron Artest).</p>
<p>In the real world, people have a harder time getting along. People divide along political lines, religious lines and country lines.<span id="more-1740"></span></p>
<p>The natural state of people is almost to be at odds with one another. Peace is not just the lack of war. Peace is the active interrelation of two entities in harmonious activity. The opposite of peace is not war, it is merely lack of working together. It is pretty easy for two entities to ignore each other, but that is not peace. Peace is working together. Yet, peace remains so elusive on a grand scale and an individual scale.</p>
<p>This is something that is really hard for me. I honestly (perhaps naively) believe that almost all friction and disagreement is a result of misunderstanding and miscommunication. At our core, we know how to get along but the reality of society and our environment confuses us into discord. Maybe I am wrong, but this what I believe.</p>
<p>That is why seeing this photo was so stirring. It was a photo that showed that when the context changes, when our environment is different, peace is so easy. Sports provides the context for enemies to befriend one another.</p>
<p>Are there two greater enemies in the world today than Israel and Iran?</p>
<p>And yet, below you will see a photo of the best Israeli basketball player, who is now playing for the Sacramento Kings, Omri Casspi and the best Iranian basketball player, playing for the Memphis Grizzlies, Hamed Haddadi. They look like the best of friends. Yet, in their home countries people are dying for their causes in defiance of the opposing cause&#8230;</p>
<p>It is my fervent wish and prayer that we can find peace. Not just peace between nations with differences, but personal peace within ourselves and within our relationships and communities.</p>
<p>Just think of this photo the next time you are about to pass judgment or prolong a disagreement. We can all get along, we can all be a part of peace, we can all unite under the banner of the human race and be tolerant of whoever we encounter.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/CASSPI-HADDADI.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5495" title="CASSPI-HADDADI" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/CASSPI-HADDADI.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="823" /></a></p>
<p>Tolerance. Love. Peace.</p>
<p>Please.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1692  alignleft" title="wimp crybaby" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/wimp-300x204.png" alt="wimp crybaby" width="210" height="143" />Every casual sports fan in the universe has heard about the big 4th down play that cost the Patriots a victory in their epic matchup with the Colts this past Sunday</p>
<p>Facing 4 and 2 yards to go on their own 28 yard line, Belichik elected to go for the first down and not punt the ball away. The stakes were very high as a failed attempt would give the Colts an almost certain victory and a punt would make their task more difficult but far from impossible. So Belichik rolled the dice. The play actually worked, but they did not get the yardage needed for the 1st down.</p>
<p>The Colts took over on downs and patiently scored the winning touchdown with mere seconds left on the clock.</p>
<p>Below is a video of the play.<span id="more-1688"></span></p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="635" height="383" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/PsU-jkmYXyM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="635" height="383" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/PsU-jkmYXyM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Everyone and their grandmother has an opinion about this play. The strongest initial reaction came from a couple of former Patriots defensive players turned analysts. Rodney Harrison and Tedy Bruschi felt this was a huge slight to the Patriots defense. Belichik sent a message to them that he could not trust them to stop the Colts offense and he felt he had a better shot at victory by gambling on 4th down.</p>
<p>Right when it happened I found myself thinking about my favorite ESPN.com columnist, Gregg Easterbrook. He writes the Tuesday Morning Quarterback (TMQ) column and has been saying for years that punting is a worse play than going for the first down on 4th down. There is even a high school team that (almost) NEVER punts &#8211; and they win! NFL Head Coaches punt because they won&#8217;t be blamed for their defense allowing a score but the Coach is blamed if the 4th down conversion fails. It is all about shifting the blame according to TMQ. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=easterbrookpreview/070904" target="_blank">Here are some numbers and analysis to back up his claim.</a> In short TMQ claims, punting is for wimps. <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=easterbrook/091117&amp;sportCat=nfl" target="_blank">Read his predictable take on the play here</a>.</p>
<p>The next wave of opinions on the Patriots failed 4th down conversion is in. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704431804574540100532247022.html?mod=wsj_share_facebook" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal backs up Belichik&#8217;s decision</a> with TMQ-esque numbers. <em>There was a <strong>70%</strong> chance of victory with a punt and a <strong>79%</strong> chance of victory if they went for the 1st down.</em></p>
<p>Plus, they have an opinion. Belichik is an abberation. In their own words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Above all, though, the essence of Mr. Belichick&#8217;s &#8220;crime&#8221; may be something simpler than all this: His decision went against the natural instincts of all human beings when they&#8217;re forced to make high-stakes decisions. In a recent study, researchers from Duke and UCLA found that when faced with a decision involving risk, people have an overwhelming tendency to make the supposedly safe choice—to err on the side of caution—even though doing so may lead to worse results.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Passive mistakes can cost more than aggressive mistakes.</p>
<p>It is foolish to be aggressive when the aggressive move carries more risk than the passive move.</p>
<p>It is cowardice to make the passive choice when the aggressive choice carries less risk, and you are just too big a <em>wimp</em> to make the right choice.</p>
<p>And if the defense is going to be upset they are big crybabies. You are on a team. You&#8217;re collective job is to win. If you are not willing to do what it takes to win, you don&#8217;t belong in a competitive game like NFL Football. The Head Coach is paid to win the games, the players are paid to execute the game plan and we are the suckers who spend our time and energy watching a bunch of wimps and crybabies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1638" title="Matisyahu-One_Day" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Matisyahu-One_Day-300x300.jpg" alt="Matisyahu-One_Day" width="240" height="240" />I first heard of <a href="http://www.matisyahuworld.com/" target="_blank">Matisyahu</a> while working as a <a href="http://jamoncampus.com" target="_blank">Campus Rabbi</a> at USC. The Jewish students on campus were really into his music (this was ~5 years ago) and some of my students invited me to join them at a Matisyahu concert.</p>
<p>He was performing at the <a href="http://la.knittingfactory.com/" target="_blank">Knitting Factory</a> in Hollywood which was right near my home. I went and it was really cool. The music was great, the message was equally wholesome and the connection that I got to build with my students was profound.</p>
<p>I liked it enough that I took my wife to a Matisyahu show at the <a href="http://www.ajula.edu/" target="_blank">American Jewish University</a> a few weeks later. It was a bad venue for a concert. It was more like a movie theater than the right venue for a reggae concert. Still, we enjoyed the music.</p>
<p>I knew that Matisyahu had made it, when<span id="more-1635"></span> I was listening to my then favorite sports radio show, &#8220;<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2009/01/loose-cannons.html" target="_blank">The Loose Canons</a>&#8221; on AM 570 in Los Angeles (oh how I miss those guys&#8230;) and they played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO3ca5FshCY" target="_blank">Chop &#8216;em Down</a> as their bumper music. That was an epiphany for me. At that point, Matisyahu has &#8220;made it&#8221; in my books.</p>
<p>If that wasn&#8217;t sufficient proof that Matisyahu had &#8220;made it&#8221;, I received another clue a few weeks ago. I was playing the <a href="http://2ksports.com/games/nba2k10" target="_blank">NBA 2K10</a> video game and the background music was&#8230; Matisyahu!</p>
<p>I found a video of the NBA 2K10 playlist so you can see for yourself.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="634" height="502" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_c76U_Eenhk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="634" height="502" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_c76U_Eenhk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>I thought that was pretty cool.</p>
<p>But today around the blogosphere and on Twitter the latest Matisyahu news is regarding the new NBC advertisement for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>This is, by far, the best exposure that Matisyahu has seen in the public eye. The commercial is perfect. The content, the timing of the cuts, the slow &#8211; motion, the music and the message are woven together to create a really perfect ad. The emotion that the 30 second spot exudes are exactly what NBC wants you to feel.</p>
<p>I like NBC as a network and I hope that they can mount a comeback and become relevant again. This ad is a great start.</p>
<p>I am sure Matisyahu is proud to be part of such a great ad. I am proud to share it with you.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1225" title="unity" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/unity-300x300.jpg" alt="unity" width="180" height="180" />Rosh Hashana at <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a> was wonderful. The services were inspiring, the attendance was excellent and the mood properly reflected the importance of the days.</p>
<p>I spoke from the pulpit several times over the holiday.</p>
<p>There was certainly an over-arching theme to my sermons. Each had its own individual message but overall they reflected an idea that I feel is central to Rosh Hashana, judgment, repentance, Judaism and Humanity.</p>
<p>It is too easy to get  caught up in ourselves. We hope for a good verdict, we try to be the best people we can be as individuals.</p>
<p>For me, the greater challenge is fitting in the group. Every time I spoke over the Holiday, the underlying theme was Unity.<span id="more-1224"></span>Each person really has three identities.</p>
<p>One is our own personal accomplishments. Everything that one does in their life goes into this category and those things have value on their own. We look at the person in a vacuum and assess their achievements as an individual. Everyone has unique talents and abilities that make then who they are.</p>
<p>The second identity is the person&#8217;s group. Everyone is part of various groups. Whether by religion, race, political party, trade or family we all belong to groups. Those groups form a part of our identity. But each group member&#8217;s individual role is not relevant. The group has an identity and by association with that group, that identity becomes the identity of everyone in the group.</p>
<p>The third identity is the most important. It is the combination of number 1 and number 2. It is how we interact with the group using our individual talents and abilities. This identity is the meeting point of the indidual and the group. If the individual is selfish and uses their talents and abilities for their own personal gain and ignores the group, the person has failed in this identity. But if the person is able to part if the group and use their individualism to elevate the group, then in turn, they elevate themselves.</p>
<p>No where is this third identity clearer to the observer than in competitive team sports. The individual performer has his or her own talents and abilities. What separates the great ones from the rest, is their ability  to use those skills and elevate the team.</p>
<p>It is no different in real life. We all have skills and we are all part of groups. We need to use those skills to elevate our groups, not just ourselves.</p>
<p>It was particularly appropriate to find a <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/6975/more-than-a-game-preview" target="_blank">short post on the NBA Truehoop Blog about this issue today</a>.</p>
<p>LeBron James has a new movie. It is supposed to be about teamwork, but as Truehoop so eloquently puts it, the preview completely fails in this regard.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The bummer about it, however, is that the movie is all about teamwork, but the undeniable message of the preview&#8217;s format (James, shooting alone in a gym) is that celebrity trumps all.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Watch the preview below and you will see just what they mean.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="325" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RlEi1iYCukQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="325" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RlEi1iYCukQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Good imagery for the wrong message. We need to be team players in sports and more importantly in life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1193" title="Love" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/love8-300x235.jpg" alt="Love" width="300" height="235" />Parenting has been on my mind lately.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/09/17/kim-clijsters-tennis-champion-and-mother/" target="_blank">Earlier today I posted about Kim Clijsters and the sacrifices of working mothers</a>.</p>
<p>It must be the impending Rosh Hashana that is influencing these thoughts of parents and children.</p>
<p>Parenting is tough job. There are no vacations. There is no financial remuneration. It is oftentimes thankless.</p>
<p>Also we are so clueless as to how to parent. Babies don&#8217;t come with a handy manual or set of instructions. The questions all parents have are endless.<span id="more-1185"></span></p>
<p>To punish or not? When to compliment? To be honest with our children about their shortcomings? I always think about Simon Cowell asking some terrible &#8220;singer&#8221; if anyone ever told them that they are just not talented. And then they cut to that parents telling their kid how great they are. No one wants to be that parent.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/health/15mind.html?em" target="_blank">very popular article in the NY Times about parenting this week</a>. The article explains, based on a study by 2 Israeli researchers, that conditional love can be just as harmful to children as punishment. Meaning, when a parent only doles out love for their child when the child performs as the parent expects the affect on the child is the same as punishing the child when the parent disapproves of the child&#8217;s behavior. The child may accomplish more, but will ultimately feel resentment, anxiety and feel unhappy.</p>
<p>The proper way to love one&#8217;s children is unconditionally.</p>
<p>Love is not a tool that we wield to bend the child into submission. Every child needs the love of its parents. Always.</p>
<p>This is a message we can take into Rosh Hashana. It is true that it is a day of judgment and that can give us reason to pause and be fearful of our verdict. There is a Judge and there is judgment.</p>
<p>We have one saving grace. The Judge is our Father.</p>
<p>The relationship that we have with God is the same as the relationship that a parent has with a child. Unconditional love.</p>
<p>When it comes to our moment of judgment in the heavenly court we know that we are unconditionally loved by our Father in Heaven no matter how far we may strayed from His path. Just remember that our Father is waiting for us with a warm embrace.</p>
<p>Children that feel unconditionally loved have less problems feeling accepted later in life. Unconditional love is the greatest gift a parent can provide for their children. Sometimes it may seem hard when children frustrate us.</p>
<p>A great video has been circling the internet the last couple of days.</p>
<p>The video really illustrates what I have been saying in this post. Even when our children frustrate us, we must love them unconditionally. Even if we &#8220;frustrate&#8221; God, He has a warm embrace for us. He is our father.</p>
<p>The father in this video looks like he is about to get frustrated with his daughter. Then he embraces her.</p>
<p>Perfect imagery for this post. Enjoy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1187" title="Kim Clijsters" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Kim-Clijsters-carries-dau-0021-300x221.jpg" alt="Kim Clijsters" width="300" height="221" />Something has been on mind the last few days. The last three blog posts I have attempted to write have been all on the same topic. I have decided to turn them into two blog posts and this is the first of a two part series.</p>
<p>The topic is parenting. The relationship between parents and their children.</p>
<p>It is a timely subject as the Jewish Calendar turns the page into a new year. A major element of the Rosh Hashana liturgy is the relationship between us and God. That relationship takes a few forms. One form is that of a parent to a child.</p>
<p><span id="more-1183"></span></p>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/usopen09/news/story?id=4471433" target="_blank">Kim Clijsters won the US Open</a>. The US Open is a Tennis Tournament featuring the greatest players in the world. Clijsters was a dominant tennis player a few years ago and then she took a break to have a baby. She had the baby and two and a half years later came back to competitive tennis. Her first major tournament in her comeback was the US Open. And she won.</p>
<p>What struck me is the media&#8217;s attention to the fact that she was a mother and yet somehow was able beat the odds and win the US Open. I think that is noteworthy because parents have different priorities than non-parents. Parents put their kids first and their lives second. That Clijsters could be a mother whose primary concern was her child and still had enough in the tank to train and compete and win is very impressive.</p>
<p>Clijsters demonstrated the true strength of being a woman. She demonstrated the ability to have her cake and eat it too. Clijsters is at the top of her professional world and is also a relatively new mother. Congratulations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I just can&#8217;t help but wonder how all this affects her child.</p>
<p>Is there a cost? Does her child miss her mother when she spends long hours training? Should a mother of a young child be spending more time with her child?</p>
<p>I think it is great that women have opportunities for success. I really do.</p>
<p>But what about the child? What if the father is also working a tough, time consuming job?</p>
<p>Who raises the children?</p>
<p>I know that this question is broader than Kim Clijsters winning the US Open. But the media attention surroounding her success and motherhood got me thinking.</p>
<p>What is the feminist approach to this issue? How are parenting duties divided when both parents work? Does it even matter? Or are children just as well off being raised by paid surrogates?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1043" title="Giants Stadium" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Giants-Stadium-1-300x214.jpg" alt="Giants Stadium" width="300" height="214" />A few months ago, the New York Jets football team <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2009/04/15/2009-04-15_jewish_fans_jolt_jets_nfl.html" target="_blank">made headlines </a>when they moved they 4 PM Sunday game on Erev (the day before) Yom Kippur to 1 PM. This time change would give Jewish people wishing to observe Yom Kippur the opportunity to be home before the start of Yom Kippur at sundown on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>This was a nice gesture. It was also, completely unnecessary as Jews are comfortable with and used to compromising to satisfy their Religious beliefs. Jews who keep kosher often cannot eat at business lunches and Shabbos observant Jews miss live college football every Saturday in the fall. Missing a Jets game the day before Yom Kippur is not that big a deal. Plus, it is like a badge of courage to miss an event for your religion. Just ask <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Koufax.html" target="_blank">Sandy Koufax</a>. Missing the game is not that big a deal. Yet, the change was made.</p>
<p>Now it seems that this decision by the Jets is causing a bit of a problem.</p>
<p><span id="more-1042"></span><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/its-a-mitzvah-u2-reschedules-concert-because-of-jets-game-and-jewish-holiday/" target="_blank">NY Times Arts Beat Blog</a> is reporting that this minor schedule change by the Jets is affecting thousands of people. The award winning band, U2 had scheduled a concert in the same stadium the Jets use (ironically, called Giants Stadium) for the Friday before Yom Kippur. Thousands of fans made travel plans, inlcuding flights and hotels ot make thier U2 pilgrimage and see the band&#8217;s live show. That Friday night show has been canceled and moved two days earlier to Wednesday. According to U2&#8242;s piblicist, the change was needed to make the show logistically possible, due to the now earlier Jets game, they were concerned that the field would not be ready for the Jets on Sunday.</p>
<p>As U2 lead singer and social activist, Bono, croons in &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCzccXAF8Lo" target="_blank">City of Blinding Lights</a>&#8220;,<em> blessing&#8217;s not just for the ones who kneel, luckily. </em>Meaning, all prayers are valuable, not just the &#8220;kneelers&#8221; (I assume <em>&#8220;ones who kneel&#8221;</em> means Christians for whom the kneel is a contemporary prayer pose). So, Bono is just respecting the Jews right? Maybe.</p>
<p>But, there is an elephant in the room. Thousands of U2 fans are being inconvenienced. Thousands of U2 fans are going to need to make alternate travel plans and will lose money because of this change in schedule.</p>
<p>That is not fair. It may even be grounds for a law suit. Who knows? Ask your local lawyer for some insight into promissory estoppel and breach of contract.</p>
<p>More importantly, for people like me this has spawned an outrage from U2 fans and others on the NY Time Arts Beats Blog and I am sure other places as well. Now I get to read Jew friendly comments like <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/its-a-mitzvah-u2-reschedules-concert-because-of-jets-game-and-jewish-holiday/#comment-122223" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/its-a-mitzvah-u2-reschedules-concert-because-of-jets-game-and-jewish-holiday/#comment-122229" target="_blank">this</a> from rightfully angry fans.</p>
<p>Disturbing as well, is the headline for the blog post on NY Times: It&#8217;s a Mitzvah&#8221;, insinuating that changing the concert date is a good deed. I disagree. It is not a mitzvah to cause financial harm to innocent U2 fans.</p>
<p>There is one more thing that nags at me about all this. The Jets made their change months ago. U2 knew about the change months ago. Changing the date now may be necessary but it should have been done at the time the Jets made their schedule change. By not making the change and then crossing their fans by changing the date after fans have already made plans and then &#8220;blaming&#8221; it on a Jewish holiday (it says in the <a href="http://www.u2.com/news/title/scheduling-change-for-giants-stadium-performance" target="_blank">press release</a> &#8220;out of respect for the Jewish faith&#8221;) gives Jew haters (<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090826213103AA4oUA7" target="_blank">like this guy</a>) the opening they need to spew their venom. That is just not right.</p>
<p>Take the blame yourself. Don&#8217;t blame it on us. That is certainly not a mitzvah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>This week&#8217;s big sports news involved my favorite athlete to hate, Brett Favre.</p>
<p>I mentioned Favre a while back in a post about immaturity and athletes. Back then, I was contrasting the complimentary way in which Favre is recognized for his youthful exuberance and the way athletes who act immaturely and hold out for money or take PEDs are lambasted. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/03/11/does-jeff-mcgregor-learn-messilas-yesharim/" target="_blank">(Read all about it here.)</a></p>
<p>I dislike Favre, but it is not really his fault. ESPN makes me hate Favre with over-reporting and unprofessional, blatant favoritism and flattery of Favre. It is just impossible to like a guy who is in the news that much.</p>
<p>For others, the hatred toward Favre is due to his &#8220;treachery&#8221;. To illustrate I have some photos for you.<span id="more-1012"></span></p>

<a href='http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/20/brett-favre-treason-and-teshuva/75557955jd014_minnesota_vik/'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/favre_is_going_3400_large-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="75557955JD014_MINNESOTA_VIK" /></a>
<a href='http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/20/brett-favre-treason-and-teshuva/sport-nfl-football/'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/brett-favre-jets-debut_nc-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="SPORT NFL FOOTBALL" /></a>
<a href='http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/20/brett-favre-treason-and-teshuva/18258_feature/'><img width="150" height="150" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/18258_feature-150x150.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail" alt="18258_feature" /></a>

<p>You see, to most people the &#8220;real&#8221; Brett Favre is the one on left. He is wearing a Green Bay Packers jersey. Favre became a superstar in Green Bay and carried the franchise for a decade and half. Then he retired.</p>
<p>Retirement did not suit Favre well and he came out of retirement and was traded to the New York Jets, that is the middle picture. The Jets had to guarantee they would not parlay Favre to the hated Minnesota Vikings, lest they suffer a tremendous penalty. The season started well for Favre and his Jets, but the season was derailed and injury forced Favre into retirement, again.</p>
<p>In February 2009, Favre unequivocally stated that he will stay retired this time.</p>
<p>In June 2009, Favre expressed interest in returning to the NFL once again, this time as a Minnesota Viking. After flirting with the idea, Favre clearly expressed that he was not returning to the NFL and he was staying retired.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Favre signed a 2 year deal with the Vikings. That is the picture on the right.</p>
<p>To Packers fans this was treason. Like a Hatfield becoming a McCoy, a Montague becoming a Capulet or a Jet becoming a Shark, this was perfidy.</p>
<p>Packers fans are burning Favre jerseys in effigy for his mutiny.</p>
<p>Is it reasonable for an athlete or even a fan to think that treachery is possible in sports? How is this normal? Are sports so powerful that it becomes like a religion, a marriage or nationalism that is so important that if one changes teams it is treason?</p>
<p>Seriously. People take sports way too seriously. I enjoy sports, I follow sports and I watch a lot of sports. Don&#8217;t think for one second that I treat it like a religion. In fact I can prove it. I am a sports polygamist (<em><a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/simmons/020226.html" target="_blank">see here for definition and the opposing point of view</a></em>). I like a few teams in every sport. People look at me in horror when I explain to them that I like 2 NFL teams equally. Or that I follow 7 or 8 baseball teams. They don&#8217;t &#8220;accept me&#8221; as a real fan. &#8220;You can only root for one team&#8221; they say. Says who? Is it like religion where you need to choose? Is it like marriage, one wife or husband per person?</p>
<p>Favre sees through those &#8220;sports as religion&#8221; fanatics. Favre sees it as a game, as a business and as entertainment, and that is exactly what it is. He wants to play, he is going to play and he doesn&#8217;t care for whom.</p>
<p>There can only be treason when something is so important and vital that reneging on that thing is harmful. Sports are not in that category.</p>
<p>Another example of placing too much meaning in sports comes up in the Performance Enhancing Drugs in basbeall argumnent. You will hear critics say that the PEDs besmirch the sanctity of the game. Is there anything more self contradictory than &#8220;sanctity of a game&#8221;?!?! The whole is that is it is a game! An escape from sanctity! Sanctity is part of religion, not baseball. Sports are a game, entertainment. There is no sanctity and there is no treason.</p>
<p>But there are things that have sanctity and there is treason. As a Rabbi, I think it is supremely important for everyone to develop a theology that they believe in strongly. That belief should be strongly enough that reneging on that belief would be treacherous. We should constantly reevaluate our position,and perhaps treason is the right decision at some point, ala Raoul Wallenberg. The point is that we should find things in our life that we believe with conviction. We need an understanding of what is right and what is wrong, what is true and what is false.</p>
<p>As I heard many times from Rabbi Motti Berger, &#8220;Truth is something worth dying for and in some cases, worth killing for&#8221;. What is that truth?</p>
<p>Tonight is the first day of Elul. the last month of the Jewish calendar. That means judgment day is just a month away. It is high time to kick into gear and work out our true beliefs. Only when we know what we are willing to die for can we begin to live for something.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>During the summer months many people find some extra time to catch up on their reading. By reading, I mean books with paper, ink, covers and turning pages. I don&#8217;t mean on a backlit display plugged into an electrical outlet.</p>
<p>This summer, I have been too busy to do any real substantive offline reading. I have done a lot of online reading, but my book reading has fallen behind.</p>
<p>One exception has been <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/06/book-review-dovbear-on-the-parsha/" target="_blank">DovBear on the Parsha, and you can read my review here.</a></p>
<p>Part of the reason for this is that in my &#8220;spare time&#8221; I usually end up reading up on Law School materials. I actually enjoy reading cases and Law Review articles, so my reading of other stuff has fallen a bit behind.</p>
<p>There is plenty of summer left and I thought it would be nice to provide some of my all time favorite reads and a quick note about why I like each book.</p>

<div>Rabbi Matis Weinberg&#8217;s series on Torah is simply incredible. Full lenght essays on important topics highlighted by side notes citing sources from Shakespeare to &#8220;The Zen Art Of Motorcycle Maintenance&#8221;.

</em></strong></p>
<div>Really all of Gladwell&#8217;s books are superb. Blink is my favorite because it applies to all of us. We are all experts in something and understanding how we can analyze things quickly and effectively gives us confidence in our decisions. Buy this book!</div>

<div>A charming book that makes us think about the small things in life. Moving and inspirational, this book is a super read.</div>
<div><strong><em><a id="static_txt_preview" style="color:#003399;" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743253973?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0743253973">A Separate Peace</a><a href="0px !important;&quot; /&gt;" target="_blank"> </a>by John Knowles</em></strong></div>
<div>My favorite book. This book is a parable about the male teenage years. Various events and reactions in the book give rise to situations we all can relate to our own lives. With piercingly sharp quotes and messages this book is timeless.</div>

<div>A book about the &#8220;future&#8221; where thoughts are managed and controlled by a government opposed to reading. Some of the awful predictions in the book have come true. If you haven&#8217;t read this book, it is about time you did.</div>

<div>The most popular book of Lawyers and Law Students everywhere. The story of discrimination, a good lawyer&#8217;s fight against a corrupt society and the innocence of children.</div>

<div>I am not a huge Grisham fan but of his books that I have read this book is the one that I liked best. I won&#8217;t spoil it by telling you why I loved it, but after you read it send me an email and we can talk about it!</div>
