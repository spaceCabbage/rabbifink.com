				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s finale season on television these days. Writers try to make the finales the most compelling episodes of the season. The best stories drag us into their narratives so deeply that we feel the emotions of the characters and the lines between fiction and reality become blurred. The story may not be true or real, but the emotions the viewer experiences are very true and very real.</p>
<p>This week’s Torah portion feels like the season finale of the Joseph saga. There’s a tendency to lose focus of the Biblical narrative and forget to experience the story. I make sure to tune in to the Joseph epic every year. It&#8217;s my favorite story in the Bible, and the season finale never fails to emotionally engage me. Joseph’s ancient drama of intrigue, fratricide, conspiracy, love, revenge, forgiveness, and reconciliation has been enthralling us for millennia but it has always been an old story about Joseph and his brothers. I can relate to elements of the story, like any other good story, but it’s always been in terms of “Joseph the person who lived in ancient Canaan with a starring role in a very old tale.”<span id="more-9065"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9068" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/untitled-188-of-272.jpeg?fit=600%2C600" alt="untitled (188 of 272)" data-recalc-dims="1" />I think there is a great need for Modern Midrash. Our old Midrashic literature is rich and full of beautiful insights from a world very different than our own. All good Midrash channels the struggles of the Zeitgeist through the lens of the Bible. Modernity has its own unique challenges that demand our attention, and we should scour the Bible for new interpretations and ideas that speak to our contemporary battles.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of Modern Midrash is Eli Schwebel’s heartfelt Ani Yosef from his Hearts Mind album. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/25/music-review-hearts-mind/" target="_blank">Hearts Mind represents a necessary evolution in the Orthodox Jewish music genre</a>. The last few decades have seen almost no musical innovation and have taken a step backwards lyrically. Ani Yosef and the rest of the album reverse that trend. The exquisite music and lyrics do not sound familiar at all in style or substance. In my mind, that is reason enough to celebrate this musical treasure.</p>
<p>More profoundly, Ani Yosef captures the tension of modern religious struggles spectacularly. It zooms out of the dramatic one-time encounter between Joseph and his brothers, turning his personal struggle into a powerful archetype of a spiritual warrior wrestling with faith and experience. We hear something original in this reinterpretation of the story. It speaks to us in a new way.</p>
<p>I discussed this modern spiritual tension with Eli. He said,<em>“Ani Yosef is my attempt at reconciling my struggle with God, my personal emotional and intellectual walls, my rich Jewish heritage, tradition, and culture, and my unfolding consciousness.”</em> The song was written at a time in Eli’s life where the tension of <em>“trying to fuse a deep sense and knowledge of oneness with the education of a very specific way to connect with God”</em> felt overwhelming. The raw emotion of that moment in Eli’s life is the soul of Ani Yosef.</p>
<p>Today, Finkorswim.com proudly presents the exclusive debut of the Ani Yosef Lyric Video. Behind the bold-faced text in the video, a story is told. This is an almost perfect metaphor for all Midrash. The text is in the foreground, but the interpretation is happening in the background. This video tells a new interpretation of the Joseph story. It’s a Midrash Inception, and in a subtle way, it makes the song’s message even more profound.</p>
<p>I asked Eli about this new artistic Midrash that combines music with Torah, and modern life. Eli grew up singing in the home of a famous singer and is the grandson of a Chazan, which gave him an intense love for music. Their music was most often expressing the sentiment of someone outside the self. <em>“You take a verse, add a tune, and voila, there is a connection. This is the first level, the lowest and the safest.”</em> There is a second level too. It is original. It tells the story of a hero outside the self. The singer steps into the shoes of the hero, almost voyeuristically. <em>“Shloima Carlebach is a great example of utilizing stories and verses as an escape from his deep inner brokenness. But he never explicitly expressed his true self. He never let go and shared his broken heart and shattered soul.”</em> There is yet a third level, when the music becomes a true expression of self. This is what we are missing. It is the place where the inner anguish and torment is displayed with complete candor and confidence. <em>“Where is the Orthodox Jewish Johnny Cash? Who is utilizing Jewish tradition, its symbols, or its Torah to say something intimate?”</em></p>
<p>It has become unfashionable in the Orthodox Jewish community to honestly acknowledge religious struggles. Instead, we’ve created a false binary choice. One is either in or out, seemingly arbitrarily. Challenges and personal struggles are not seriously addressed. Ani Yosef hits this tension in the bulls-eye.</p>
<p>Eli was very candid about this problem.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“The reason the frum world is so scared of this expression is because it speaks to what is perceived as the greatest threat to Orthodox Judaism: doubt. Any sort of doubt is considered blasphemous. The mantra is ’never doubt.’ Meaning, you may not doubt. True art and personal expression can focus and connect the entirety of the human experience, including doubt and darkness, to something beyond our personal experience. But specifically there must be a &#8216;from&#8217; to go toward. If we negate and minimize the from, we lose authentic context. If we negate and minimize our truest, deepest thoughts and feelings, we lose the ability to channel or transcend those feelings. We may feel good at a</em> kumzitz,<em> we may dance, but the artist that awakens something deeper toward something higher, is one that is completely whole with their demons and their power when they express their soul artistically. In the eternal words of the great Bob Dylan, ‘Chaos is a friend of mine.’”</em></p>
<p>Indeed, chaos should be a friend of ours. As a society, we&#8217;ve decided that chaos is our enemy. Joseph&#8217;s life was a life of chaos. Beauty and spiritual growth emerge from chaos; we just have to embrace it.</p>
<p>I asked Eli about his inspiration for the song and the video.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Towards the end of his life, my grandfather Joseph Wassner (another Yosef) and I developed a deep bond as we talked about our ideas and our struggles. This song layers the life of Biblical Yosef, imagining what he must have been going through yearning for his fathers love, dealing with the anger towards his brothers, having to deal with his identity shifting as he takes on an entirely new culture, and his ability to still hold on to the core values by which he was raised. That is exactly what I am trying to do as I discover my place in this world, as my grandfather did, as we all do. The story of Yosef is all of our stories!”</em></p>
<p>I agree. We all need to find Yosef in ourselves. We tend to see the forefathers as larger-than-life figures, and it can be impossible to relate to them. They <em>should</em> be viewed as archetypes of our struggles. We are selling ourselves short by idealizing the Bible heroes, because we lose the ability to connect to them in a meaningful way, which is the whole point. Find yourself in the stories. Find yourself in the Joseph story. You’ll discover that it is really true for you: <em>Ani Yosef</em> &#8211; I am Joseph.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many of you, I&#8217;ve had a difficult few weeks. Technology makes it too easy to be intimately aware of the myriad details and reactions and rumors and feelings across the world as we lived through the slow drip of news and information regarding Eyal, Gilad, and Naftali.<span id="more-8602"></span><img class="alignright  wp-image-8605" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/451520016.jpg?resize=313%2C209" alt="Developments In Case Of Missing Israeli Teenagers" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We bared our souls and left our emotions on our sleeve throughout the last few weeks. But now it&#8217;s over. There is a void where our worry and concern occupied our hearts. It begs to be filled.</p>
<p>Music can help us heal, or at least help us cope. The tune that has been working for me is one of my favorite Jewish songs, Umacha by The Rabbis&#8217; Sons. It was therapeutic for me to make this little video with some of the poignant images set to Umacha. It helped me a little so I am sharing it with you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About six weeks ago, I had the unfortunate experience of being intimately involved in a unique shiva. A member of our community suddenly lost a 4 month old grandson. The father of the child is a friend and peer of mine. Shiva was observed in our neighborhood as opposed to the home of the parents sitting shiva. All of these factors made the entire ordeal quite difficult and horrific but also provided a learning experience for me and an interesting study of human nature and character.</p>
<p>It was only a few days after the shiva that I received an email from a reader who was disenchanted with the shiva process. He had several complaints that rang true in the immediate wake of the recently completed shiva I had seen first hand.</p>
<p>I believe that people want to do the right thing when they go to shiva. They just don&#8217;t really know what they should be doing at shiva. Mourners are going to be sensitive and mistakes are going to hurt them more than typical faux pas. Some of these faux pas were gloriously lampooned in this great video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGxOR5bQavs" target="_blank">Shtick Yeshivish People Say At Shivas</a> I had a lot of time to think about shiva and people&#8217;s needs during this time. Here are some of the ideas that have been swirling around my head.</p>
<p><span id="more-8174"></span></p>
<p>When I was 15, a very close friend lost his sister. Over the next few years we talked a lot about death, his feelings, and dealing with it all. I&#8217;ll never forget what he told me about what he considered the most meaningful and comfortable shiva visit. As 10th graders at Ner Israel, we were deathly afraid of out <em>Menahel, </em>Rabbi Yosef Tendler. He was the law and we were not the most law abiding of students. The way we felt about Rabbi Tendler reflected his reputation. He was tough, blunt, and scary. Rabbi Tendler came to the first day of shiva and my friend was not really in the mood to see a scary rabbi while he was mired in his own pain. Rabbi Tendler walked over to my friend so my friend rose from his seat out of respect. Rabbi Tendler moved closer and embraced my friend. They just stood there for a few minutes, wrapped in a warm hug. He didn&#8217;t say a word. They just hugged. My friend started to cry and they hugged some more. Eventually, the embrace ended. Rabbi Tendler sat down and just listened to the mourners for a while. My friend does not recall Rabbi Tendler saying a single word. Years later, my friend related to me that Rabbi Tendler paid him the most comforting shiva visit of anyone. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/02/12/book-review-i-am-your-servant-the-life-of-rabbi-yosef-tendler/" target="_blank">Knowing Rabbi Tendler the way I do now, this was to be expected.</a>)<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/yahrzeit.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8175" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/yahrzeit.jpg?w=980" alt="yahrzeit" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This is really the key to shiva. Whether it is a figurative or literal hug, shiva visits are an opportunity for embrace. That&#8217;s really what our role is in these moments.</p>
<p>Embrace means more than just what we should do, it also informs us about what we should not do.</p>
<p>People have a tendency to want to fix things. Problems bother us. Disunity and ambiguity make us uncomfortable. When people die, especially people who die under non-ordinary circumstances, it makes us uncomfortable. Rabbi Tendler also used to say that when someone dies, people have a tendency to ask &#8220;was he sick?&#8221; as if that makes it all better. We have a need to come to terms with things in our own way. We don&#8217;t like just letting things be what they are, that is, confusing.</p>
<p>People want the mourners to tell the story of the deceased. They want to know how they died. They want to know the circumstances. They want to feel better about the confusing parts of existence. If they have an answer it makes them feel better.</p>
<p>Bu we don&#8217;t go to shiva to feel better. That would be a mistake. We go to shiva to comfort our brothers and sisters who are in pain. Alleviating your personal curiosity does not help the mourner one bit. That&#8217;s not an embrace. It&#8217;s closer to the treacherous embrace of Laban as described by the Midrash. Laban hugged and kissed Jacob to see if Jacob was carrying jewelry. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like when probe for details about the life or death of the deceased.</p>
<p>Sometimes visitors will even get into debates with the mourners. Whether it&#8217;s philosophy, arguments about facts, questions about medical treatment administered to the deceased. or just side things that are really irrelevant. Shiva is not a time for intellectualism or debate. It&#8217;s a time for emotion. It is a time for embrace. Shiva is a time for unconditional love. Discussions and Socratic questioning do not have a place at a shiva home. Practice listening. That&#8217;s what mourners need. They don&#8217;t need your personal opinions on anything. If they want your opinion, they will ask for it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen many people come to a shiva house and try to fix the mourners. They try to make the mourner feel better. They are being genuine. They try to tell a story or vort that will put everything in perspective and make sense out of it all. They imagine that the mourner will be comforted by their efforts. They think that they know what the mourner needs to hear in order to make their pain go away. It takes a special kind of self-confidence with a dash of narcissism to think that your pithy thought will fix everything.</p>
<p>This is not an embrace. This is fixing things. We can&#8217;t fix it. Don&#8217;t try.</p>
<p>Making matters worse is that the mourner does not actually want to be fixed. We have a misconception about the pain of mourning. We think it&#8217;s best for the mourner to avoid the pain. We think that is the right path for them. It&#8217;s true, the mourner is in pain. But the mourner needs to experience that pain. Shiva is their opportunity to be mired in the struggle of dealing with mortality. When we try to fix it, we are really telling them that they should not be experiencing that pain. We are telling them that they need to be fixed. They do not need to be fixed. They need to be embraced. They need to be acknowledged. What we really say when we try to fix them, is that their feelings of pain are misplaced. They hear us saying that their pain is not important. They hear us not acknowledging their feelings. That&#8217;s cold and more importantly, wrong.</p>
<p>The unspoken truth of these ideas is that mourners need one thing: Empathy. It&#8217;s not easy to be empathetic. It&#8217;s especially difficult when our own hearts are torn into pieces by devastating news. It gets even harder when we see the people we care about in such visceral pain. But that is the job of a shiva visitor. Put everything on hold and practice a few minutes, or more, of pure empathy.</p>
<p>Attempt to feel the pain of your friend. See if you can hear what they are saying. Elicit their feelings instead of facts. Show that you are genuinely concerned about them. Acknowledge their pain. Be liberal with hugs and expressions of love. That is what shiva is supposed to be about. An outpouring of love and support. It is not your chance to play armchair therapist to fix the mourner or amateur journalist to elicit all the facts and figures surrounding the death. Provide unbridled love and support. Be a listener. Be empathetic. Be what they need you to be. You might even find that this is helpful in other areas of your life.</p>
<p>I think shiva has great potential to help mourners. It also has great opportunities for us to practice empathy and love. We need to calibrate ourselves to meet these challenges. If make our shiva visits mindful of these ideas, I think we have a better chance of emerging from these tragedies and difficult times better than we were when we entered them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BBC Newsnight facilitated a bit of a debate between a policy maker at Oxfam and Daniel Birnbaum, CEO of Sodastream. Kudos to the BBC for making it happen. It&#8217;s not easy to bring opposing perspectives into a room to discuss heated issues. The host also did a masterful job at working with both guests to help them articulate their points.</p>
<p>Most people I know think that the Oxfam guy did a terrible job and Birnbaum was superb. I agree. If you haven&#8217;t seen the video yet, check it out here:<span id="more-8095"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cd9ioQrTqoY?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The Oxfam guy was brutal. He assumes too much and he can&#8217;t explain himself well enough to be taken seriously. But Oxfam does have an articulable position. While, I disagree with Oxfam, I think it&#8217;s worth understanding their position, if only to articulate clearer counter arguments. [Straps on lawyer helmet.]<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BBC-Newsnight.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8096" alt="BBC Newsnight" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BBC-Newsnight.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Oxfam is certain that Israeli &#8220;settlements&#8221; in Palestinian territory are the reason that many Palestinians are living in a humanitarian crisis. They believe that any problem Palestinians endure can be attributed to settlements.</p>
<p>Their idea of settlements is not homes or cities. They consider any Israeli anything in the West Bank to be part of the &#8220;settlements&#8221;. So homes, businesses, factories, checkpoints, all of it, are considered settlements in their view. Their tactic for discouraging settlements, is to ban all products (and people) who are living or doing business in settlements.</p>
<p>Therefore, while one person, or one family, or one soldier, or one factory, might be doing some good for the individual people they are helping, it harms the overall condition of the Palestinians because it is a &#8220;settlement&#8221;. And settlements are the problem for the greater group even if they are good for a smaller group within the greater group. So while Sodastream is amazing for what they do, they cannot be supported, and are subject to the ban.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the syllogism. Oxfam holds that Sodastream is located in Palestinian territory. They are an Isreali business therefore they are a settlement. Settlements cause all the problems. Therefore, Sodastream must be stopped for the greater good.</p>
<p>(The poor Oxfam guy on BBC couldn&#8217;t articulate this, so he looked even dumber than he should have.)</p>
<p>Anyway, here are some counterpoints [Straps on other lawyer helmet.]:</p>
<p>Under Oslo, Sodastream is not actually on Palestinian territory (maybe).</p>
<p>There are much bigger reasons that Palestinians are living in poverty.</p>
<p>A factory is not a settlement. It&#8217;s a place of business. It could be argued, perhaps, that building a home or village could be seen as a land grab, seeing as it really only benefits Israel. That might be worthy of protest from Oxfam. But a place of work for Palestinians certainly is NOT a settlement. It&#8217;s an opportunity.</p>
<p>Banning products from the settlements is a poor way to help Palestinians. There are much better ways to assist them.</p>
<p>It could be argued that by giving opportunities to Palestinians to interact in positive ways with Israelis is a far better way of achieving mutual respect and peace than faux outrage and hostility through boycotts.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s just a bit of analysis:</p>
<p>Oxfam&#8217;s fatal flaw is that they are operating with far too much policy and defining words and ideas much too simply. This is typical of big institutions. They can&#8217;t make decisions on an ad hoc basis so they revert to policy and broad strokes. They can&#8217;t analyze the individual problem and issue on its own and so they miss the boat completely. Because of the opportunity for better wages and the opportunity to foster friendship and camaraderie, I think more Sodastreams would probably bring peace and prosperity closer for Palestinians and Israelis. If Oxfam wants to solve the humanitarian crisis, it seems to me that this is a good start. Certainly better than a boycott.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good lesson for us living in a very large and cumbersome Orthodox Judaism. We also have a lot of policies. We also oversimplify ideas and words. We also fail to analyze things on their own merits, instead relying on generalities and stereotypes.</p>
<p>We need to constantly remind ourselves that policies might work for, say 65%, of the community. But everyone else needs more flexibility and case by case analysis. For example, over the last 20 years, the Kollel lifestyle was our policy. That was what people did for 2-10 years after they got married. It&#8217;s become unsustainable. Now the policy is starting to change. But I worry that we are just changing policy. We should be dealing with people as individuals. We should be finding our brightest stars and cultivating leaders. We should not just be saying Kollel is a poor choice for everyone. There are tons of other well intended policies in Orthodox Judaism, this is just one example. Policies are more efficient. But perhaps it&#8217;s time to cut back a bit on the efficiency and focus more on effectiveness.</p>
<p>My grandfather used to say, the only policy he has is that he doesn&#8217;t have any policies. I think that&#8217;s a good policy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Israel, a haredi woman named Ruth Colian is asking that the Israeli government stop funding haredi political parties because they discriminate against women. The haredi parties will not place a woman on their ballots, yet they are receiving money from the government. Colian argues that the government is sponsoring gender discrimination by supporting the patriarchal system of haredi Judaism in politics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good argument and I hope she wins. But that&#8217;s not the issue here.<span id="more-7733"></span></p>
<p>The real issue is that Colian is running as a haredi woman for political office. She won&#8217;t run on a secular list because she says she is haredi. She wants to break the glass ceiling in the haredi community. I wish her luck because it won&#8217;t be easy. In the past, people who tried to change haredi norms were either pushed out or left on their own accord. It&#8217;s an uncomfortable place to be a revolutionary but maybe Colian will be the one.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7735" alt="feminism2" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/feminism2.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>If she is successful, it will mean yet another avenue that haredi women can achieve the same level of acclaim and success as men. Leaving the rabbinate as one of the few places haredi women cannot. That might prove to be a difficult position to maintain.</p>
<p>Corian is a true haredi feminist. She is haredi and she is vying for equal opportunities for women. This is the basic premise of feminism. It comes in many flavors and textures, but at the heart of all of these feminist movements is a sense that men and women should have equal opportunities and that men should not dictate the role that women must play in society. One can see how feminism and haredi life seem incompatible. While it&#8217;s true that many, if not most, haredi women choose to play the dignified and refined role of mother, wife, and homemaker on the sidelines of religious and communal life, there are many women who would prefer to have a choice to play a more public role in religious and communal life. That is what the haredi feminists want.</p>
<p>When juxtaposed with a trailer for an upcoming documentary on the hasidic community of Brooklyn called Uniforms: The Hasidic #Community, Corian&#8217;s struggle seems even more poignant. The documentary was produced by a self proclaimed non-traditional Jewish woman. She offers a peek into the softer, more spiritual side of Hasidic Judaism. It&#8217;s a noble attempt to show good people living good lives. The public has a negative perception of Hasidic Judaism and this documentary could go a long way to bridging that divide.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the extremely problematic conflation of different hasidic groups in the movie, illustrated by the visuals of chasidim in shtreimels and double head coverings for the women, while hip Chabad people talk about their more liberal way of life, there was a line in the trailer that requires attention.</p>
<p>A woman, who almost certainly is Chabad as betrayed by her perfectly unaccented English, proclaims: <em>&#8220;Jewish [sic] women, we&#8217;re kind of the biggest feminist women out there. Judaism creates space for women to tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I think that if a woman wants to &#8220;tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children&#8221; she should have that opportunity. I am all for traditional values for women that want those values in their lives. It&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s one of the secrets to Orthodox Judaism. In fact, I think it&#8217;s a problem that so many husbands and fathers are studying all day while their wives are leaving the home to support their husbands and babies are being dropped off at day care. I believe the traditional home is a great ideal and bearing children is a wonderful and powerful role to play in this world.</p>
<p>However, it is decidedly not feminist. It can be feminist to choose that life. But if everyone is doing it, or is expected to do it, it does not fit any accepted meaning of the word. You can&#8217;t unilaterally change the entire meaning of the word feminist and apply it to haredi Judaism. It doesn&#8217;t pass the laugh test, forget the smell test.</p>
<p>And why is feminism an ideal for this haredi woman? Why is she trying to pretend that a world where women are not given every opportunity that men are given and they are expected to produce large families is feminist. It&#8217;s not feminist at all. Proudly so! Recently, I heard a prominent rabbi say that Jewish feminists were comparable to reform and conservative Judaism! Orthodox Judaism is not feminist. You need to be okay with that to be orthodox.</p>
<p>In Israel, Ruth Corian is dying for the opportunity to lead her community. She is a feminist. In Brooklyn the party line is apparently that being a mom is the most feminist thing one can do.</p>
<p>Again, I am not degrading moms. God forbid! I think it&#8217;s a great choice if one can and one wants to make it. But it&#8217;s not feminist if that is what is expected. But even more perplexing is why are you trying to call it feminist?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is an isolated incident. I&#8217;ve seen this more and more often. People are selling Orthodox Judaism as feminist. I&#8217;m a pretty liberal Orthodox Jew and I don&#8217;t see how anyone could interpret my religion as feminist.</p>
<p>Personally, it bothers me. I grapple with it. I struggle with the current inequality and I empathize with those orthodox Jewish women who want to play a more prominent public role. I wish Orthodox Judaism had more feminist opportunities. I do my best to accommodate feminism within tradition. But I don&#8217;t redefine the term to conform to my orthodox worldview. Words have meaning and that meaning must be respected.</p>
<p>It seems impossible, if not extremely unlikely, that orthodox Judaism will ever have equal opportunities for men and women. Maybe that&#8217;s okay. Not every religion or creed has to conform with every modern sensibility. But let&#8217;s at least be honest about it. And if we can, try to break as many glass ceilings that we can shatter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A viral-ish video (almost 3k Likes) released before Yom Kippur poked fun at the rabbi&#8217;s sermon. The video featured puppets teaching the viewer how to write a High Holiday sermon. They said to start with a joke (see here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/09/15/why-do-rabbis-make-jokes-at-serious-times/" target="_blank">Why Do Rabbis Make Jokes at Serious Times?</a>), then tell a story, then make your point, but keep it short and interesting, unless the audience wants to sleep longer, har har har. It&#8217;s classic lowbrow sarcastic humor.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the joke was &#8220;funny&#8221; because rabbi&#8217;s speeches are predictable and formulaic. Further, this is seen as a very bad thing because things that are predictable, especially rabbi&#8217;s speeches, are no good.<span id="more-7644"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7646" alt="Screen Shot 2013-09-16 at 10.23.19 PM" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-16-at-10.23.19-PM.png?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>People thought the video was funny. I didn&#8217;t. But I actually have a problem with the concept of the video.</p>
<p>The underlying assumption behind the joke is that speeches should not be formulaic and that rabbis should not follow a script. I think both of these assumptions are wrong.</p>
<p>Things that are formulaic can be amazing. Baseball is formulaic. Pitch, hit, catch, throw. Political speeches are formulaic. Hit the talking points, wait for applause, repeat. Movies and TV shows are formulaic. Law and Order is as formulaic as can possibly be. A good meal has an appetizer, main, a salad, and a side dish. Predictable. But delicious. Formulas can be wildly successful. Just because something has a formula hardly means that it&#8217;s not impressive or worthwhile. Some of the most successful things in our world are formulaic. Ted Talks are incredibly formulaic. And incredibly popular. It&#8217;s pedantic and petty to harp on the formula of the rabbinic sermon. It&#8217;s not a valid criticism.</p>
<p>The second assumption is also wrong. That is, rabbis are usually decent teachers and orators. But to be those things rabbis should follow a script. Rabbis are teachers not entertainers. We don&#8217;t want baseball players to juggle chainsaws and we don&#8217;t want politicians to tap dance. Why would anyone expect rabbis to do anything other than teach and lead their congregations? Why should rabbis be expected to become entertainers?</p>
<p>Sure, rabbis should attempt to spice up their talks and not be stiff or boring. But the video implies that because rabbis use a basic formula for their sermons they should be mocked. They shouldn&#8217;t. Rabbis must be creative within the bounds of the expected formula but that&#8217;s it. What do they expect? A variety show starring the rabbi? Improv? Ludicrous.</p>
<p>Spontaneity and quirkiness have their place but a sermon is neither the time nor place for either of those. Perhaps our society overvalues surprising and thinking different. Sometimes we need to not think different and certainly not to mock thinking &#8220;the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using a video to make fun of the traditional rabbinic sermon just before the High Holidays was not only in bad taste, but it only served to subvert the important role that rabbis play this time of year. It was a poor choice to produce the video and an even poorer choice to release it just before the High Holidays.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sermon formula is not going to change. Nor should it. Different rabbis will have varying levels of success at speaking from the pulpit but it will almost always be within the same framework. This video only undermines rabbis without making a case for how rabbis could even do it any differently. Rabbis are not going to sing their sermon like Operaman sings the news. Rabbis are not going to mime their sermons. Rabbis are not going to direct a three part play. They are going to speak and they are going to use common speaking techniques to get their point across. They are going to make jokes and tell stories to bolster the attention of the audience. That&#8217;s the formula. Making fun of it is just dumb.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my most precious memories are the many years we sat in our family Sukkah with my grandparents as our guests. My grandmother still joins my parents for Sukkos sometimes. But my grandfather passed away almost 11 years ago ,yet his presence in my life is constant.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible for me to think about Sukkos without thinking of my grandfather singing &#8220;A Sukkeleh.&#8221; Even as I type these words I feel a swell of emotion and tears invade my eyes. It meant that much to us. I might not have appreciated it enough as a child, but I do now.<span id="more-7640"></span></p>
<p>With some Internet elbow grease I was able to get a digital copy of the song and after a couple of hours of work I put this video together. It might be nothing special or have little meaning to you but the song means a lot to me. My grandfather would have loved this. I don&#8217;t understand Yiddish so I had to find a translation of the words online. I used R&#8217; Shafran&#8217;s version as seen on <a href="http://www.torah.org/features/holydays/stillstands.html" target="_blank">Torah.org</a>  (see his article too) with a couple of tiny adjustments:<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7642" alt="tri_55474_1999-92" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/tri_55474_1999-92.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>A sukkaleh, so small<br />
Wooden planks for each wall<br />
Lovingly I stood them upright<br />
I laid thatch as a ceiling<br />
And now, filled with deep feeling<br />
I sit in my sukkaleh at night.</p>
<p>A cold wind attacks,<br />
Blowing through the cracks<br />
The candles, they flicker and yearn<br />
It&#8217;s so strange a thing<br />
That as the Kiddush I sing<br />
The flames, calmed, now quietly burn.</p>
<p>In comes my daughter<br />
Bearing hot food and water<br />
Worry on her face like a pall<br />
She just stands there shaking<br />
And her voice nearly breaking<br />
Says &#8220;Tattenyu, the sukkah&#8217;s going to fall!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear daughter, don&#8217;t fret<br />
It hasn&#8217;t fallen yet<br />
The sukkah&#8217;s fine, banish your fright<br />
There have been many such fears<br />
For nigh two thousand years<br />
Yet the sukkeleh&#8217;s still standing upright.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night the Red Sox and Yankees played the rubber match of their three game series at Fenway Park. Over the last 15 years these series&#8217; have meant a great deal to both teams as they battled for AL East supremacy and often enough for the best record in baseball.</p>
<p>These days, the stakes are not quite as high as the Yankees are no longer one of the best teams in the AL East. But there was some added drama to the weekend series despite the lower stakes.</p>
<p>Alex Rodriguez is in the midst of a huge controversy. What began as a simple performance enhancing drug use suspension has ballooned into a media and litigation circus. Arod has now been accused of ratting on teammates and others. He claims the Yankees are trying to smear him and ruin his career. It&#8217;s a very complicated mess.<span id="more-7463"></span></p>
<p>Some baseball people view PED use as enough to be banned from the game. But nearly all baseball people agree that snitching on a teammate is beyond the pale. Thus, the brotherhood of baseball players wished to exact revenge on Arod the nogoodnik.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7464" alt="081813-MLB-Yankees-Alex-Rodriguez-PI2-AA_20130818231449469_660_320" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/081813-MLB-Yankees-Alex-Rodriguez-PI2-AA_20130818231449469_660_320.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Their salvation came from a pitcher on the Red Sox named Ryan Dempster. In his first at bat, Arod saw four pitches. The first went behind him. The second and third nearly hit him. The fourth hit him square in the back. To everyone in the world it was obvious what had just happened. Dempster deliberately hit Arod. The reasons were up for debate. Was it personal? Was it about PEDs? Was it about being a sideshow? Was it about being a snitch? Was it the combination of all of it. But no matter who you ask, everyone will agree that Dempster hit Arod on purpose.</p>
<p>In the end, Arod handled it with class and propelled the Yankees to victory. It&#8217;s an odd day when Arod is the good guy and the hero. But that&#8217;s what happened.</p>
<p>Beaning baseball players in a time honored tradition. It has a similar feel to it as fist fights during hockey games. NBA and NFL rules have less opportunity for targeting a player outside the rules of the game, but Ron Artest (not the Malice in the Palace incident &#8211; I am referring to in-game violence), Bruce Bowen, Ndamukong Suh, and Albert Haynesworth demonstrate that when there is a will there is a way. However, those incidents are punished by their games and are not considered part of the game. Baseball and hockey enjoy a special distinction that intent to injure or harm outside the game can be considered as part of the game.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Yaakov Weinberg used to say that it was prohibited for a yeshiva student to play tackle football. (Most people did not follow this rule.) His reasoning was simple. How can one play a game where the entire point of the game is to hurt someone else? Now it could be argued that this might display a lack of nuance in understanding the game of tackle football. However, the principle is sound. A game is a game. But when it becomes about inflicting pain on others it moves from game to something else entirely.</p>
<p>People are defending Dempster. They are saying that Arod had it coming. It&#8217;s possible that Arod did deserve it. But I don&#8217;t think that we should support vigilante justice in our sports. Throwing a ball at 95 miles per hour at a very unprotected man is reckless. It happens all the time in baseball but that does not make it right. Intent to harm is not acceptable. I am not saying that pitchers can&#8217;t pitch inside or try to move batters off the plate. I am talking about deliberately throwing at an opponent for the purpose of hitting the opponent with the pitch should be banned. Intent is easy enough to discern in most cases. The grey area cases will require wisdom and good guess work, but I think the price is too high. A game should not provide an outlet for personal and private side shows that take away from the game and make the spectacle into a violent one. We all agree that if the batter would throw his bat at the pitcher he would be out of line. The opposite should be true as well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for baseball to eliminate the deliberate bean ball. It has no place in the game and the people of our society should not condone this kind of behavior. Even from athletes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7202" alt="131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630.jpg?resize=300%2C168" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Every group or cause needs a spokesperson. There is no more eloquent a spokesperson for her cause than Leah Vincent. (No offense to the rest of her group intended.)</p>
<p>Leah represented herself and Footsteps quite nicely on Katie Couric&#8217;s show, creatively named Katie. Every story about someone leaving the ultra-orthodox community has the potential to be a huge chillul Hashem and an abject failure. My sense of the segment on Katie was that despite the significant obstacles placed before her, Leah has been very successful in her personal and professional life. The segment veered from a discussion about the flaws or problems in her community. In fact, it almost glossed over them.</p>
<p>If one was looking for a chillul Hashem, I think it would be hard to find one in this segment. It was much easier to see chillul Hashem in previous television appearances by those who left ultra-orthodox Judaism. I think it speaks to Leah&#8217;s dignity and demeanor that the segment was so respectful.<span id="more-7200"></span></p>
<p>Leah&#8217;s story is harrowing. She points to two traumatic incidents in the segment. One ended her childhood and the other ended her life. When her parents cut her off, Leah was forced to live on her own, work minimum wage jobs just to survive. It&#8217;s not clear what her level of observance was at the time, but I gather that she was still orthodox. Unfortunately, this kind of thing happens in our community. It&#8217;s being worked on and hopefully we will see less and less of this odd form of &#8220;tough love&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then she was raped. Leah was obviously trying to control her emotions when she talked about this second traumatic event. She pushed through it displaying great strength and courage. I do wonder what happened to her attacker. Nothing was mentioned about that.</p>
<p>I found it interesting how Leah still calls the world of her childhood &#8220;my sect&#8221;. She still identifies with the community. I guess that&#8217;s a good thing, but I also think it shows how hard it is to leave.</p>
<p>Here is what is a little different about Leah&#8217;s story. She is not from a chasidic background. She got a decent secular education and speaks English perfectly. Others who have left orthodox Judaism, leave with a rudimentary education at best, and a speech handicap that may appear to limit them. Also, being from the non-chasidic world, it is more likely that Leah encountered Jews who were not ultra-orthodox in her childhood. The level of insularity in her world is less than in the chasidic world.*</p>
<p>Which leads me to the real purpose behind the segment. I think the goal was to publicize the work of <a href="footstepsorg.org" target="_blank">Footsteps</a>. On the show, Footsteps was said to provide a safe place for those who left orthodox Judaism and especially ultra-orthodox Judaism. They tend to social and psychological needs as well as practical needs of those who left orthodoxy. People like Leah, who needed friendship and emotional support. Others need help getting GEDs or jobs or speaking English properly.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of orthodox Jews who look at Footsteps as the enemy. They see them as the group that is making it easier to leave and as part of the problem. Or worse, they seem them as evangelizing those who are still in the community and influencing them to leave.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see it this way at all.</p>
<p>The people who need Footsteps are our brothers, sisters, cousins, children, and grandchildren. They are our family. Our system didn&#8217;t work for them. No system can work for everyone. Are we to leave them to die in the streets? If we have not prepared them for life on the outside, we are failing our duty to our own family members. If we do not provide them with warmth and support even after they leave, they must get that love and support somewhere. Footsteps is doing that work.</p>
<p>Of course, I would prefer to see our community provide these services. I would rather we all learn English and earn high school diplomas. I would love it if we could stay connected emotionally to those of us who leave. And we are working on all that. Hopefully we will get there soon. But in the meantime, Footsteps is doing <em>our </em>work by helping those in our community who leave. We must express our dismay that there is a need for Footsteps. We must also express our appreciation for Footsteps. They are doing our holy work of taking care of our children for us.</p>
<p>So long as Footsteps is not actively trying to draw people out of our community I think they should have our support. If they do attempt to subversively foster dissent and revolt, I can&#8217;t see how we can embrace their mission. Either way, we must thank them for taking care of our family members. So, thank you Footsteps.</p>
<p><em>*UPDATE: Leah&#8217;s background is non-conventional. She grew up in a non-insular community but her family tried to live an isolated life.</em></p>

It may seem like your average AL East battle between two up and coming teams, or it could just be a symbolic contest between the two cities with Ner Israel yeshivas, Ner Israel Baltimore and Ner Israel Toronto. (No relation)</p>
<p>One bochur attended the game and I doubt he expected he would be caught on camera during the game. Surely he did not think he would be one of the stars of ESPN SportsCenter.</p>
<p>I hope he wasn&#8217;t skipping <em>seder.</em></p>
<p>Colby Rasmus hit a ball deep into foul territory just foul of left field. Nate McLouth made a spectacular attempt to catch the ball diving into the stands mere inches from our baseball loving yeshiva bochur. It wasn&#8217;t absolutely clear whether the ball was caught. The bochur attempted to clarify matters for the umpire by signaling that it was no catch. In one SportsCenter broadcast, fellow member of the tribe Steve Levy was narrating the highlight and he said something about how &#8220;you got to trust the kid in the cap&#8221; (referring to the bochur&#8217;s yarmulka). The umpire would have none of it and called the batter out.</p>
<p>Clearly the bochur is a Blue Jays fan and he got caught up in the moment. He must have thought he saw the ball pop out of McLouth&#8217;s glove. I&#8217;d hate to think he got caught lying intentionally on national television.</p>
<p><em><strong>EDIT</strong>: The bochur is sticking to his story in the comments below. He says the ball popped out. However, even if the ball did pop out it was a catch before McLouth crashed over the wall. So the umpire made the correct call.</em></p>
<p>The amazing catch finished the night as the SportsCenter Top Play of the night. The catch and the bochur were shown on TV dozens of times. The bochur is famous!<span id="more-7117"></span></p>
<p>Fortunately, the bochur had no part in the beer throwing incident moments later that resulted in the ejection of the guilty fan in the same vicinity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6987" alt="bill-maher" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/bill-maher.jpg?resize=250%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" />A lot of people are very excited that uber-liberal Bill Maher has nasty things to say about Islam. Maher&#8217;s premise is that Islam is the <em>most</em> violent religion today by far and therefore it is unreasonable to raise the argument that religious extremism exists in other religions.</p>
<p>The joke Maher uses to make his point is that he wonders (and this is not his joke) if there could be a &#8220;Book of Islam&#8221; on Broadway like there is a Book of Mormon on Broadway. Maher is correct that a Book of Islam show would probably incite people.</p>
<p>To make this argument work the parameters must be equal. In fact, a plain reading of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/04/22/a-secular-explanation-for-terrorism/" target="_blank">my post from yesterday </a>is a direct rebuttal of Maher&#8217;s point. If there were 1.6 billion or 2.2 billion (whatever the actual numbers are) Mormons living in developing countries, under oppressive regimes, with poor education, and little chance for freedom or financial success, I am fairly certain that you would have violent, Jihad-like Mormons.<span id="more-6986"></span></p>
<p>The same goes for Jews, Christians, or whomever. People living under those conditions will have a greater propensity towards violence and anti-social behavior. It spans all religions, creeds, and time.</p>
<p>We have senseless systematic violence all over the world. It usually comes back to these same factors.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the point here. There are more dispositive factors in deciphering why certain people turn to violence and others do not. Ignoring factors that are universal and pointing to factors that are theological and specific to one group is a fair argument, but it&#8217;s not the only argument and probably not the best argument.</p>
<p>Why did Christians go on Crusades every few years a few centuries ago? For the same reasons. And so when we say &#8220;look at Christian violence from history&#8221; we are not saying that Christianity is <em>also </em>a &#8220;violent religion&#8221; we are saying that the factors that made Christianity seem violent throughout history are the same factors that make Islam seem violent today. But eliminating those factors is the best way to fix the problem not blaming religion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Maher&#8217;s cute joke is a red herring and that&#8217;s why I still maintain my position that there are much more fundamental factors that create an environment conducive to senseless violence than a book.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Bill Maher dismissing a Professor of Hate and Extremism:</p>

One particularly devastated area was the Seagate neighborhood of Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Seagate is a orthodox Jewish neighborhood. Many people living there are in basement apartments compounding the effect of the storm.</p>
<p>A massive effort was coordinated to try assist in the clean up of the neighborhood. Jews from all over the east coast (and I am sure some from further away too) organized a huge volunteer network and despite all their great work, much more work still needs to be done.</p>
<p>A very touching video has been produced that depicts a small sliver of the kindness amidst the destruction.</p>
<p>It is hard to watch and even harder not to feel a strong tug of emotions as you watch. The confluence of devastation in people&#8217;s homes and the outpouring of support from the community is quite moving. Equally impressive is the potpourri of Jews who came to help. You&#8217;ll see all shapes, sizes, and colors of orthodox Jewish men in the video. It is powerful to see the unity displayed for the sake of this relief effort. It was also cool to see my brother in law doing work in the video. Shkoyach!</p>
<p>Great job by Aryeh Gelbard of Studio 7 producing this video. Thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/family.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6377" title="family" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/family.gif?resize=300%2C208" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A bunch of people sent this video my way. They all suggested I watch the video and they all felt the video was very powerful. I needed to find 30 minutes to watch it. This morning I had an opportunity to watch it and I must say that I wholeheartedly agree with them.</p>
<p>The video is a student project (read: not very professionally produced) but sometimes simplicity is the most pure form of art. It is a documentary that tells the story of three daughters, maybe three and a half daughters, of prominent religious Zionist rabbis in Israel. I am not familiar with too many religious Zionist rabbis but I have heard of all three of these rabbis.</p>
<p>Each of the daughters is no longer as observant as her family. The film explores that tension in a very real way.<span id="more-6375"></span></p>
<p>In my opinion, the film is not about rabbis and daughter. Only one of the daughters seems to have been particularly affected by the fact that her father was a prominent rabbi. The other two could have just as easily been daughters of any orthodox family.</p>
<p>I trust you&#8217;ll watch the video when you have the time and I am sure you will have your own reactions.</p>
<p>Here are some of my thoughts on the video.</p>
<p>The fathers come off really well. I am sure it was not always so pleasant growing up as a rebellious daughter of a prominent rabbi. Yet they are portrayed at loving, down to earth, and genuinely concerned about their daughters. Especially Rav Aviner.</p>
<p>The daughters all seem really artistic, artsy even. I think this is a very important point. Of all the personality types that might not be compatible with orthodox Judaism, I think the artsy type could be the most difficult. Artsy types, and I know this is a generalization, value and crave independence. Freedom of expression and thought is a large part of what makes people artistic. Conforming to orthodox Judaism is hard for artsy types if they are born into it. A lot of Baalei Teshuva are artsy for the opposite reason. They left their homes and expressed themselves via orthodox Judaism. But I think it is still fair to say that the artistic Baalei Teshuva are non-conformist orthodox Jews. I think that is great. But we need to find more opportunities for artsy types who are born into orthodox Judaism, especially for young women.</p>
<p>Thinking about this from a rabbinic perspective was interesting. First of all, I am the son of a rabbi. My experience actually somewhat mirrored the one daughter (Bigman) whose experience was rabbi-centric. She was &#8220;more orthodox&#8221; than her peers as a child. I had a similar experience. My father was the principal of a modern orthodox school and we had higher religious standards than almost all of my friends. It was not easy for me either. Going to high school at Ner Israel almost turned that upside down as many of my peers had more religious homes than mine. Perhaps they balanced each other out. But I was able to relate to her struggle very much.</p>
<p>I am also the father of two sons of a rabbi. I know that it can sometimes be challenging for them to be the son of a rabbi. But in this respect, I don&#8217;t see their experience mirroring that of the daughters all that much at this point. I am not a super famous rabbi who is called away from his family too often. I feel more like a regular dad who happens to be a rabbi. But the video certainly illustrated the fears that I have in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>I am sure that some people will watch this video and attribute the issues these daughters have to their more open religious Zionist lifestyle. They will blame this philosophy for these rabbis&#8217; daughters leaving orthodox Judaism. This is burying one&#8217;s head deep into the sand. Amongst every kind of orthodox Judaism there are people who leave. There are daughters of every single kind of rabbi out there who have left orthodox Judaism. It is not a new phenomena either. It is a part of our heritage and history. I really hope that people don&#8217;t come away from this video and see it is a justification for living any other form of Judaism as a protection against this.</p>
<p>The most important thing about this video to me, is that it raises the issue of how to deal with children who are not following our personal choices. It can be extremely challenging for a parent when a child reject their way of life. Sometimes rejection is absolute. The parents are orthodox and the child is secular. Sometimes it is far less absolute. The parents are chasidic or very yeshivish and the child is modern. Or the parents are modern and the children are ultra-orthodox. These can sometimes be very challenging situations as well.</p>
<p>I think that it is very important that the parent / child relationship not depend on religious observance. It is hurtful to parents when children diverge from their parents&#8217; way of life. But that pain cannot be more prominent than the love of a parent for a child and a child for a parent.</p>
<p>Every child needs to feel accepted by their parents. Every child needs to know that they are loved for who they are even if they are doing things which parents do not approve.</p>
<p>In so many of our prayers and remarks around the High Holidays we note that despite our failings God loves us unconditionally. We need to be able to follow the lead of God on this one. If God can do it, we need to at least try.</p>
<p>Not everyone works the same way and not everyone can be exactly the same. We need to find a place in our communities and even in our families for different forms of expression. Sometimes those forms of expression may be in accordance with halacha, and sometimes they might be at odds with halacha. While the orthodox community cannot condone the breaking of halacha, we must understand that it simply does not work for everyone. If we want to have relationships with our friends and family who are not as comfortable in the box, we need to let them know that they can still be loved and accepted despite our religious differences.</p>
<p>Everyone yearns for acceptance. Clearly, in our homes we should not make acceptance dependent on religious practice. But even in our communities we should not make acceptance dependent on religious practice. The Jewish people are a family. We have all types and that&#8217;s just fine with us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sacks.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6262" title="sacks" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/sacks.jpg?resize=300%2C187" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I deeply admire Chief Rabbi Jonathan Sacks. It is with great interest that I watched his BBC Television program on Science vs. Religion. I really enjoyed it, but found it a bit disappointing.</p>
<p>The premise is that Rabbi Sacks is on a mission to open dialogue with premier British scientists. The production value is high and it is an enjoyable program. (Although I can&#8217;t for the life of me understand why the YouTube video is not in HD and appears squished.) The show is from his perspective. This means that it edited and cut to his liking. This is fine, but it severely limits the objectivity of the show.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch intelligent people talking about important things, but clearly the content is dumbed down for a broad audience.<span id="more-6261"></span></p>
<p>The best segment is the Richard Dawkins segment. Rabbi Sacks challenges Dawkins and Dawkins challenges the Rabbi. Neither of them really answer each other&#8217;s questions. It&#8217;s a little frustrating to the viewer who actually wants to see highly intelligent people debate.</p>
<p>But the value in this video lies not only in the actual questions and answers, its value lies in the acknowledgement that there are questions that science cannot answer and that there are questions that religion cannot answer.</p>
<p>The one thing that bothered me in watching this video how many times scientists challenged Rabbi Sacks about the &#8220;truth&#8221; of Torah and religion and Rabbi Sacks did not answer them with a clear response. I don&#8217;t know if he has a clear response, but there was none in the video.</p>
<p>But there was much to like.</p>
<p>I like how Dawkins differentiates between Darwinism to explain our existence and his refusal to use Social Darwinism to create society. I loved how Rabbi Sacks pounces on this as a way of showing that bad science can be just as damaging as bad religion. Then Rabbi Sacks uses Dawkins&#8217; response to this to show that there is common ground between Religion and Science in that we all share certain values and in those areas we should work together to ensure those mutual goals are met and not foiled by bad religion or bad science. Dawkins is even willing to work together toward common goals.</p>
<p>How many times have I said the same kind of thing with regard to atheism, other religions, secular Judaism, progressive religious Judaism and traditional religious Judaism? I agree with this vehemently. There are many problems that plague us all. Many of the solutions to those problems can be found in religion and science.</p>
<p>Rabbi Sacks ends the program with a soliloquy on the &#8220;power of the conversation&#8221;. This is my mantra as well. The Internet is a place to have that conversation but it must carry over to world of human interaction. We need to enable this kind of conversation as much as we possibly can.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean that we need to have the same conversation about science and religion. I mean that we need to have conversations between all of humankind on matters upon which we agree. Those areas are so broad and vast and in those areas we can all contribute. The secular world has much to learn from religion and its values. Religion has much to gain from science. Let&#8217;s not allow our differences to get in the way of progress for mankind.</p>
<p>As we begin a new Jewish year, let us commit to opening dialogue between all people of faiths and creeds for a better tomorrow.</p>

The national media has picked up the most important story in the orthodox Jewish community of our day. Nothing compares to this. Not Internet bans or Siyum celebrations or kosher hot dogs. This is THE issue of our time.</p>
<p>CNN does a superficial but somewhat thorough and honest segment on abuse in the chasidic community.</p>
<p>I have embedded the report below. You can watch it, share it, and cry for the victims.</p>
<p>I will just make several bullet points:<span id="more-5737"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The segment is not sensationalist or riddled with half-truths. It is honest and straightforward.</li>
<li>Denial is a powerful drug.</li>
<li>I honestly believe that Hynes is not &#8220;protecting abusers&#8221; for the sake of votes. I think he can&#8217;t prosecute without witnesses and he needs cooperation from victims to prosecute. (I wrote about that here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</li>
<li>One in five being abused is a number that is not scientific but is very possible. One in five thousand would be enough to push us to deal with the issue. One in five is a number that demands immediate and powerful action.</li>
<li>The intimidation of victims and their families should warrant its own segment. Protecting abusers and sacrificing victims is not just heartless and stupid, it compounds the effects of abuse by giving victims the right to think that they are sacrifices and I believe can be linked to victim suicide.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s obviously not just in the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish communities that abuse occurs, but the approach to dealing with abuse is the main difference between the chasidic or even orthodox Jewish community and the rest of the world. We are not equipped to deal with it internally even if we admit that we have a problem. How could we be?</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/good-job-blue-ribbon.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5680" title="good-job-blue-ribbon" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/good-job-blue-ribbon.png?resize=217%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>After the Celtics defeated the Heat in Game 5 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals in what will surely be remembered as a disastrous game for LeBron, Wade, and company something managed to distract the public from the actual game. As Shane Battier and Ronny Turiaf exited the court through the tunnel the very loud, high pitched voice of a child pierced through the depressing noise of the arena.</p>
<p>While millions of people were watching the dejected Heat hang their heads in shame, one young fan&#8217;s voice pierced through the airwaves with an inspirational message. &#8220;Good job!&#8221; Good effort!&#8221; he cried. His team had just suffered a horrible loss, he must have been in pain, but he rose above it all to give his favorite players a bit of hope and positive reinforcement as they left the court.<span id="more-5678"></span></p>
<p>The young man&#8217;s name is Jack Meyer and he 9 years old. He has been a fan of the Heat since he was 3 or 4 years old and he must have been really upset after that loss. But he probably plays sports in a league and when his team loses or is getting outplayed his coaches probably shout out the same refrain. &#8220;Good job! Good effort!&#8221; I bet it lifts his spirits when he hears it and he just wanted to share the same inspiration to his favorite athletes.</p>
<p>The story is touching and absolutely adorable. You have to admire this kid&#8217;s positivity and his good job and good effort in inspiring his team.</p>
<p>Postivity is so important. We can accomplish so much when we feel good and when we feel like we are doing well. To be sure, pain and suffering can be excellent sources of inspiration as well. Perhaps necessity and anguish are even more effective motivators. But for the majority of us whose lives are not overloaded with pain and suffering, positive reinforcement is a great motivator and a great way to keep us from falling into melancholy or apathy.</p>
<p>But the truth is that sometimes a good job or a good effort is simply not enough. It could be argued that the Heat did not do a good a job and did not give their best effort. But let&#8217;s grant them a good effort and a good job for a moment. They still lost the game! And the game matters. Their job was to win. Their job was to give effort and do a good job but more than that, their goal was to win.</p>
<p>In life, effort matters. But results matter more. Effort matters. But achieving your goals matters more.</p>
<p>I am not trying to be a Grinch. I have a point. I think that we all have passions and responsibilities in our lives. And sometimes we neglect them. But we pat ourselves on the back and say &#8220;Good job! Good Effort! and think that is enough. It&#8217;s a start. But it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>If we want to learn more Torah, give more charity, spend more time with our spouses and children, do more acts of lovingkindness, make a difference in our communities, we can&#8217;t be satisfied with good effort. We need to demand from ourselves action and results. We all want to do more than we are doing. We can each apply this to various areas of our lives.</p>
<p>Much of the talk on the Internet is effort and sometimes it&#8217;s a good job. But if we don&#8217;t actually accomplish anything, we are not maximizing our opportunities. So many great ideas and conversations happen on the blogs and Facebook and Twitter (notice I left out Google Plus&#8230;), we need to somehow channel all of that into actual change.</p>
<p>It can be done. It must be done. Let&#8217;s do it.</p>

It&#8217;s too dangerous. He speaks his mind, is willing to challenge people, and he is very respected and beloved by the orthodox Jewish community.</p>
<p>Apparently, something got in the head of the Agudah Convention powers that be and they invited him to speak about the challenges some of our youth are going through in their lives. He speaks from experience, excellent instinct, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Two things to note:</p>
<p>Random clapping at the wrong times is cringeworthy but sadly humorous. You&#8217;ll notice what I am talking about.</p>
<p>The people who needed to hear this speech more than anybody else were not present. When the speech ends you can see the dais is empty. The rabbis in leadership positions needed to hear this speech more than anyone else. Maybe you can send then the youtube clip to watch on their shmutz phones.</p>
<p>Enjoy the speech. There is so much in there and almost all of it is right on the money. Please send this to as many people as you can:<span id="more-5445"></span></p>

<p>I have no idea if the curriculum is good or bad, useful or useless. Anything that can be done should and must be done.</p>
<p>Bullying is happening all over the world and the orthodox Jewish schools are not immune. I know of modern orthodox schools that have developed their own programs and they work. But there is a reputation in the more yeshivish schools that there is bullying and violence. I have seen it first hand.</p>
<p>FIX IT. NOW.</p>

I watched it and found it very fascinating.</p>
<p>Some of you might find it boring. But that is only because we have different interests. I love to see how people react to being questioned about their beliefs. I love seeing how people react to being informed about another&#8217;s beliefs. I love to watch people who don&#8217;t know that they are being watched.</p>
<p>If you are like me at all. You will like this video.</p>
<p>A young Israeli woman works at a hotel in London that serves kosher food and is designed for orthodox Jews. The conversations that she has with some of the patrons are enlightening. Some people make good impressions, others do not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great reminder to orthodox Jews that we need to be educated on our traditions so that we do not make up nonsensical answers, use a condescending tone, make assumptions and just in general reflect positively upon orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p><em>(I wonder if it is legal to film people without their consent and then post the video on youtube&#8230;)</em></p>

<p>He is one of the most decorated NCAA Football players of all time. He worked for years as a Missionary spreading the Gospel in Southeast Asia. He is arguably the worst passing quarterback in the NFL. He is by far the most talked about sports personality.</p>
<p>Quite a combination. Much of the talk of Tim Tebow relates to his very obvious religious beliefs. I say they are obvious because Tebow kneels in prayer during the game. He points to the sky all the time. He invokes the name of his God every time he has a chance to do so. Tebow&#8217;s antics inspired an entire internet meme called <a href="http://tebowing.com/" target="_blank">#Tebowing</a>. People would kneel as if in prayer at the most awkward times and places and snap a picture. This is aside from the very clever <a href="http://occupytebow.com/" target="_blank">#occupytebow</a> movement which is not relevant to this blog post.</p>
<p>The point is that Tebow takes his religion very seriously. Whenever athletes thank God and praise God for their accomplishments it can be irksome to everyone. Religious people of the same religion, religious people of other religions and atheists can all find ways to be offended.</p>
<p>Does God really want the Home team to beat the Away team? Does God really give special powers to some teams and not to other teams? Does a player&#8217;s religious conviction really have an impact on a game?<span id="more-4868"></span></p>
<p>I think the answer to all those questions is no. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/30/whose-fault-is-a-dropped-game-wininng-touchdown/">Whose Fault is a Dropped Game-Wininng Touchdown?</a> for my feelings on this one.</p>
<p>In fact, please read that post because you&#8217;ll see that I actually agree with Tim Tebow on this issue.</p>
<p>Tebow was asked about invoking God as part of his athletic accomplishments and he didn&#8217;t take the bait. He answered that he doesn&#8217;t give God the credit or the blame. He is merely using his platform as a way of teaching people about his religion. He emphatically denied that his religion gives him an edge or that he can play better because of God. He focused on the opportunity to use his fame and success to glorify the name of his God.</p>
<p>He also mentions that football does not define him. He is defined by his morality and good acts. He is defined by his character. So his religion is not a cause. It is merely a basis for his life. It is not part of his game on the field.</p>
<p>I think that is a great answer. Great job by Tebow.</p>
<p>What is interesting to me is that Tebow invokes the name of his God, Jesus, and that is somewhat acceptable within society. Imagine a Muslim player praising Allah or a Jewish person praising God (not Jesus). I don&#8217;t think they would be as accepted.</p>
<p>Christian displays of religious fervor are far more tolerated than that of any other religion. It can make the rest of us feel uncomfortable. Tebow is doing it in a way that minimizes the discomfort for others but even his way has rankled many people. It would be wise for people to limit religion to religious activities and not pepper it throughout their public lives.</p>
<p>Watch Tebow&#8217;s interview. The religious stuff is near the end:</p>

<p>A little while back I posted a link to a really amazing Tumblr blog called &#8220;Dear Photograph&#8221;.</p>
<p>The idea is hard to explain but when you see it for yourself the whole thing makes perfect sense and is quite touching. Dear Photograph is a blog that posts current photos of a place with a smaller old photograph of the same place being held in the same space. So for example you would see a new photo of a home and where the front steps would be there is an old photograph of some people standing at the front steps.</p>
<p>The effect is amazing. The submissions to Dear Photograph can evoke powerful emotions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so cool that I wish I had thought of it myself. Ever since I saw the blog I wished I could do some of my own Dear Photograph submissions.</p>
<p>Apparently, Chevrolet&#8217;s marketing firm wished they had thought of it too.<span id="more-4760"></span></p>
<p>A new ad campaign marking 100 years of Chevy uses the exact same concept by placing old photographs of Chevy cars and trucks in front of present day backgrounds. The resemblance to Dear Photograph is uncanny and obvious.</p>
<p>There is no attribution to Dear Photograph. I assume that Dear Photograph was not part of the campaign. A little Googling told me that I am not the only one to notice the similarities. See this: <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-chevrolet-135963" target="_blank">AdWeek</a> and the comments on YouTube.</p>
<p>It can be argued that the idea is not original to Dear Photograph either. I don&#8217;t know if it or if it is not. I can understand if Dear Photograph is annoyed by their idea being used by Chevy without being compensated for it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is no greater validation for an artist than know that their idea is being used in a multimillion dollar campaign for a 100 year old car company. It must feel great to see their vision on TV and being used commercially. If you think about it, 10 years ago there would have been no way for anyone not an ad executive to have their idea in a commercial. Now, Dear Photograph, a little blog has their idea in a huge commercial. Obviously, they would like to get paid, but it is a huge step forward for the &#8220;suits&#8221; to be taking ideas from bloggers!</p>
<p>Either way, Dear Photograph has gone mainstream and if you want to see Chevy&#8217;s inspiration head on over to their site. I think a Jewish / Israel centric Dear Photograph would be amazing. It would be really cool to see old photos of people in Israel at important sites superimposed over current photos of the same places.</p>
<p>Here is the Chevy ad:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/126571-gilad-shalit-release.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4740" title="126571-gilad-shalit-release" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/126571-gilad-shalit-release.jpg?resize=300%2C168" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>One of the more dramatic events in my lifetime has been the recent release of Gilad Shalit. I think most Jews thought he would never go home. He was released, the price was very high and now a week later we can reflect on the deal and its ramifications.</p>
<p>Perhaps the two biggest complaints that supporters of Israel have expressed are related not to Shalit, but to the 1000+ prisoners exchanged for Shalit. These complaints are divided into two categories. One category refers to the celebrations in Gaza when the prisoners returned. They were given a hero&#8217;s welcome and treated in a way that offended many people who felt that criminals and terrorists should not be celebrated.</p>
<p>I believe this criticism is partially valid. All kinds of prisoners were released. Some were terrorists and murdereres. Others were agitators who jumped the fence or snuck into Israel without permission. They were all released together. The worst offenders were supposedly sent to other countries, not Gaza.</p>
<p>For a governing body to cheer and promote terrorism there is absolutely no justification. It is horrible and should be obvious to any reasonable person that it is bad.</p>
<p>However, I do not take issue with the celebrations of individuals who were welcomed by their families and friends with cheers and whoops of joy. I have seen hardened criminals in American court and seen the reactions of their friends and families when they are released or acquitted. It is the same. I think we can all see that friends and family can be permitted to enjoy the moment their criminal / terrorist family members return home. I do not have a problem with it all.</p>
<p>The second category of complaint refers to the equivocation of some of the media and UN leadership of Shalit and the 1000+ prisoners.<span id="more-4739"></span> A similar complaint has been lodged by some members of the Jewish community against its own members who have equated Shalit with Pollard or Rubashkin. The complaint hods that there is a moral equivalency implied when Shalit and the prisoners are compared. The video below powerfully demonstrates the issue. (Watch it after you finish reading.)</p>
<p>I agree that any moral equivalency is absurd. No normal person could think that Shalit is equal to terrorist or even to Jewish criminals.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily agree that moral equivalency between Shalit and the terrorists was as common or prevalent as some others might perceive. There is a tendency to expect certain things from media coverage. When these expectations are not met one response is to get upset or point out that the media is biased or anti-Semitic or anti-Israel. I think that perhaps the expectations are simply off.</p>
<p>The media is not reading into each and every word it says like a Talmudic passage. They are reporting and for the sake of brevity, interest, ratings, or many other factors may present a headline or story from which something offensive can be inferred. In my opinion this is a useless exercise.</p>
<p>Take the primary example in the video below. The SkyNet reporter segues from the Shalit story to the &#8220;human element&#8221; of the released prisoners. Somehow this is deemed horribly offensive. I just don&#8217;t see it. There is no implied moral equivalency. What is being said is simply what was remarked above. There <em>is </em>a human element when hundreds of people who have been locked up come home. Isn&#8217;t there? So why the outrage?</p>
<p>I prefer to reserve my outrage for the actual words and acts of the despicable terrorists you laugh and giggle when told how many people they have killed. Sick.</p>
<p>Enjoy the video below.</p>

<p>The song is The Bird of Hope, the singer is Mordechai ben David.</p>
<p>For me, this song has always been a powerful metaphor for Yom Kippur. I really wanted to share it with you but it was not available anywhere online. So I decided to do it myself. I made this video <del>yesterday</del> last year. The pictures don&#8217;t do the lyrics justice, but it was worth making the video so everyone could hear the song before Yom Kippur.</p>
<p>Please watch the video and contemplate its important message.<span id="more-4695"></span></p>
<p>No matter where how drastically we fall, we can always rise from the ashes to great heights. We just need to make the right choices.</p>
<p>On a side note, this song was recorded in 1979. Mordechai ben David&#8217;s voice is so incredible in this song. It&#8217;s amazing that he is still recording new songs, but after listening to this, you will note that he a shadow of his former self&#8230;</p>
<p>I want to wish everyone a successful Yom Kippur. <em>Please forgive everyone who may have harmed you</em>. I know I have.</p>
<p>Please share this video to help everyone prepare for Yom Kippur.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/eye.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4542" title="eye" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/eye.jpg?resize=300%2C236" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In a criminal trial, several kinds of evidence are provided by the prosecution to prove the defendant is guilty. The most influential of these forms of evidence is often an eyewitness identification. A case with a positive ID is almost always going to result in a conviction.</p>
<p>The most common cause for an erroneous conviction of an innocent person is eyewitness misidentification. For years, experts have been explaining that misidentification can occur by mistake and with good faith. That doesn&#8217;t make them reliable. It just makes misidentifications into honest mistakes.</p>
<p>In many states legislation has been proposed to curb the effects of eyewitness identification. In New Jersey, the Supreme Court has spoken from the bench in an effort to fix this problem.<span id="more-4541"></span></p>
<p>When an eyewitness identification may be unreliable, the judge in the case is required to hold a hearing to determine the witness&#8217; reliability and then must instruct the jurors how much weight to place on the identification. In most cases the evidence will be heard, but the judge will educate jurors on the reliability of eyewitness identification.</p>
<p>Social science and decades of research have shown that eyewitness identifications are very often unreliable. Factors such as fear, bias, unfamiliarity with the defendant, focusing on the weapon, police misconduct, length of time between the crime and the ID all play into the reliability of the identification. Time and time again, identifications have been shown to be erroneous and have contributed to the death of innocent defendants via the death penalty and decades of prison time for other innocent defendants.</p>
<p>The New Jersey case comes ahead of a highly anticipated United States Supreme Court case next year that will decide an eyewitness identification issue. It is likely that the Supreme Court will follow the model set forth by the New Jersey Supreme Court.</p>

<p>A beautiful cross-section of Jews from around the world enjoyed the lovely musical intonations of Ron Grun. Pacific Jewish Center members showed up to the concert in strong numbers. But the non-members who joined us for the event made the concert even more special.</p>
<p>On another typical Venice Beach Sunday, dozens of folks popped their heads into the shul. Some stayed for the entire concert. Others made stayed briefly.</p>
<p>But everyone enjoyed. Once again, we were proud to spread the light of Torah and Judaism to the Venice Boardwalk community.</p>
<p>It was wonderful meeting all the people who stopped in for some of the concert and I hope we see you again soon.</p>
<p>OUR NEXT EVENT will be an art gallery over Labor Day weekend. Admission will be free.</p>
<p>We hope to see you then.</p>
<p>Thank you to the Goldstein family for sponsoring the Klezmer Concert again.</p>

<p>The NY Times has been busy with a story about Ralph Branca and his heritage.</p>
<p>Who is Ralph Branca? He&#8217;s the guy who gave up the &#8220;shot heard &#8217;round the word&#8221;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the &#8220;shot heard &#8217;round the world&#8221;? The home run hit by Bobby Thompson of the New York Giants that was immediately followed by &#8220;THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT! THE GIANTS WIN THE PENNANT!&#8221;</p>
<p>Branca has a largely ignominious place in sports lore because he gave up that epic home run.</p>
<p>During an investigative report on his life by reporter Joshua Prager, it was discovered that Branca&#8217;s mother was a Jew who emigrated to the United States in 1901 from what was then Hungary. Branca was as shocked as anyone to learn that his mother was a Jew. Perhaps he was even more shocked to discover that <em>he</em> was a Jew as well. For in Jewish law, if one&#8217;s mother is Jewish, one is Jewish!</p>
<p>Branca was raised Catholic.</p>
<p>As a kid, Branca was a &#8220;Shabbos goy&#8221;, a term I despise for its less than glamorous connotations. He performed certain tasks forbidden for Jews on the Sabbath. (In all likelihood, it was equally impermissible for those Jews to ask young Ralphie to perform those tasks on their behalf, but I digress.) Branca is quoted at the end of the story in the Times as saying that he better remain a Catholic, otherwise he would have been liable for all his &#8220;helpfulness&#8221;. To save his soul, Branca, now 85, says he must remain Catholic.</p>
<p>His faulty logic notwithstanding, Branca is a Jew.<span id="more-4512"></span></p>
<p>At least according to Jewish law he is a Jew.</p>
<p>Alan Dershowitz is of a different mind.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Ralph Branca is not a Jew,” said Alan Dershowitz, a Brooklyn-born Dodgers fan, lawyer and Harvard professor. “Whatever the definition, it doesn’t include someone who willingly accepted a different religion. He didn’t stay home on Yom Kippur like Koufax.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Koufax altered strength and guile and knew that you pitch for six days and you rest on the seventh,” he said. “Branca was straight-on; you could see there was nothing Jewish about Ralph Branca.”</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear if Dershowitz made these comments before the revelation that Branca&#8217;s mother was Jewish. If it was before, the big reveal then I am not sure what the Times is using this quote for. It is was after the revelation that Branca&#8217;s mother was a Jew I am completely at lost at how someone&#8217;s non-choice, Branca was raised Catholic or someone pitching style can be the determining factor as to one&#8217;s Jewishness. What in the world is Dershowitz saying?</p>
<p>According to Jewish law Branca is a Jew. Whether he knew it or cared for or not, he is a Jew. In this respect, Judaism is a family. A long lost cousin who did not know he was related to you can&#8217;t be excluded from the family because he has a different style than the rest of the family (if that is even a reasonable assertion, which it is not).</p>
<p>I am disappointed in Dershowitz and I welcome Ralph Branca to the tribe. Even if he was always part of it and even if he doesn&#8217;t want to be&#8230;</p>

<p>Soccer is a wonderful sport. My son loves to play, whenever I watch it I enjoy it. I really want to go to a World Cup or English Premier League game someday. Yet, soccer plays 4th or 5th or even 6th fiddle for most sports fans.</p>
<p>To be fair, a lot of the under 30 crowd loves soccer and are avid soccer fans. But by and large, soccer is not an American pastime.</p>
<p>But in my opinion, soccer produces some of the most magical moments in all of sports.<span id="more-4411"></span> Landon Donovan scored a winning goal against Algeria in extra time during the 2010 Mens World Cup. It was a magical moment. But I believe it has been outclassed by a more magical moment during Sunday&#8217;s match. The USA Women are a top team and they were playing against a top team. The USA was down one goal in extra time of an extra period. Then this happened:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why, but sports in general, soccer more than most, especially the USA National Teams has the ability to brings tears to my eyes. Something about soccer tugs at my heartstrings more than other sports or entertainment. I find the sheer joy and bliss of soccer players in a moment like this very inspiring.</p>
<p>I hope you do as well.</p>

<p>Without getting to far afield in the nitty gritty of the local politics, there is an election for a seat in Congress representing the 36th Congressional District on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Democratic candidate is Janice Hahn. She appeared to be a shoo-in for the seat in a fairly moderate to liberal district. One particular issue has turned the tides of the race and created a virtual heat heading into the final weekend.</p>
<p>The issue (this is as &#8220;neutral point of view&#8221; I can put it) is Hahn&#8217;s policies with regard to gang members. In particular she facilitated the placement of criminals as gang interventionists and had them paid via a third party.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to see how this is being portrayed negatively. Or more to the point, why this is being portrayed negatively. <span id="more-4404"></span>The biggest crime issue in Los Angeles is gangs. One of the more effective ways of curbing gang violence is negotiating peace treaties. I met the fellow who negotiated the truce between the Bloods and Crips. It took almost 10 years to form an agreement. (His name is Aquila Sherrils.) Hahn enlisted the help of some senior gang members to negotiate for peace between gangs. These representatives were paid by football legend Jim Brown&#8217;s foundation. She also strongly supported programs to help gang members receive recognition for changing their lives. All of this seems very good.</p>
<p>Yet, Fox LA ran a nearly 10 minute segment on Janice Hahn&#8217;s &#8220;horrifying&#8221; involvement with gang members. The bias and slant in this report is embarrassing (for them) and an indictment on the public. If the public does not want to see programs and initiative such as Ms. Hahn&#8217;s what do they want? If working from within gangs to promote peace treaties is a bad idea, what is a good idea? If it is seen as a blemish on ones record for thinking creatively and bravely about how to solve the gang problems what would a sparkling record look like?</p>
<p>This report has me so upset at Fox, the public and the organizers of Hahn&#8217;s opponent&#8217;s campaign who are text messaging the entire district about this horrible report. Note, the report makes no accusations of wrongdoing or impropriety. It is simply the concept that Hahn is helping gang members that is so obscene that it renders her am unqualified conduct. As one website promoting Hahn&#8217;s indiscretions put it: Hahn is directing public funds to &#8220;support violent, inner-city criminals&#8221;.<br />
Disgraceful.</p>
<p>Tell me what you think.</p>
<p>(Sorry, whoever uploaded this video squished everybody&#8230;)</p>

<p>If my last three posts offended you or made no sense to you, I hope I can win you back with today&#8217;s post.</p>
<p>This is one of most beautiful videos I have ever seen.</p>
<p>It was shot in the arctic circle and demonstrates one of the more fascinating phenomena on planet earth. The sun barely rises above the horizon, moves a bit to the side and then sets shortly thereafter.<span id="more-4310"></span></p>
<p>Much of Jewish law is predicated on when the sun rises and sets. It assumes a fairly balanced day as far as daylight and darkness with variations for summer and winter. But I just can&#8217;t imagine a 2 hour Shabbos or 2 hour fast day. Maybe that is why orthodox Jews don&#8217;t live (as far as I know,) in the arctic circle.</p>
<p>Our world is so beautiful. Enjoy it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/common-obama1-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4275" title="common-obama1-1" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/common-obama1-1.jpg?resize=300%2C194" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A little controversy arose when the First Lady invited several performers to the White House for an evening of poetry.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounded the invitation of a rapper named Common. The controversy was not over whether rap is actually poetry. It was about the character of this man named Common.</p>
<p>I confess, I never heard of Common before this controversy. But in October 2010 a Foxnews.com report called him a rap legend and told him &#8220;your music is very positive. And you&#8217;re known as the conscious rapper.&#8221; (See this link: <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/4380489/the-hot-zone-common/" target="_blank">Fox News</a>, as seen here:<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/201105100018" target="_blank"> Media Matters</a>.)</p>
<p>Seems like a great choice.</p>
<p>But Bill O&#8217;Reilly disagreed.<span id="more-4274"></span> It was his opinion that having Common sing at the White House was a travesty. His reasoning? Common sings a song in support of a convicted cop killer who was part of the Black Liberation Army. O&#8217;Reilly opines that anyone who sings a song like that must never be allowed to perform at the White House.</p>
<p>Jon Stewart took him to task and O&#8217;Reilly invited him to debate the issue on The O&#8217;Reilly Factor.</p>
<p>This is how it went down [watch this now if you haven&#8217;t already seen it]:</p>
<p><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/4ISpkUsBYuc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/4ISpkUsBYuc?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object></p>
<p>Stewart wins this debate. Clearly. There is a selective outrage machine in all of us. In this instance it was O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s selective outrage machine that was exposed as inconsistent if not racist.</p>
<p>It is important to note that although we may have a selective outrage machine, there are very different ways we can deal with that outrage.</p>
<p>I disagree with O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s other premise that if a man sings a song about a cop killer that defines him as a person and any further discussion of that person that does not express outrage over that song is some sort of approval of that song. In other words, just because Common sings one song about a convicted cop killer, that should not disqualify any other positive contributions he can make as as an artist or a human being.</p>
<p>Agreeing with, or celebrating, or hosting someone does not and should not mean that that person has carte blanche approval for anything and everything they do.</p>
<p>Yet this phenomena exists. It exists all over the place. One place it exists is Orthodox Judaism. Especially more insular, right wing brands of Orthodox Judaism (RWOJ).</p>
<p>Theologically and historically speaking, this is an important phenomena in RWOJ. Certain people and their opinions are acceptable, others are not. Thus, the entire life of the person is considered when deciding if their opinion can be relied upon or considered.</p>
<p>This may be important to the theology and history of RWOJ, but I find it unfortunate. Many good ideas could be lost or discarded simply because of the names of the people who thought of them. People are complex. Their ideas in one area might be wrong or unacceptable, but by acknowledging another aspect of their ideas that is not wrong and is acceptable we are not giving approval to the entire corpus of the persons previously held ideas and positions. It&#8217;s a standard that is impossible to uphold. No two people agree on everything. Inevitably everyone can be thrown under the bus for something.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not what happens. What ends up happening is exactly what happened with O&#8217;Reilly. Selective outrage.</p>
<p>In the RWOJ community it can mean that thieves or abusers are still voices that can and must be heard, but others with far less severe crimes, perhaps they wear the wrong head-covering or the wrong color suit, are marginalized and disqualified by the selective outrage machine.</p>
<p>It is completely normal to be selectively outraged. We all have biases and we all have different priorities. The problem is when the selective outrage machine also determines who has a voice and a right to be heard. Then we risk losing important ideas and contributions to our communities. There is no machine I know of that can bring those lost voices back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/presumed-guilty-poster.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4092" title="presumed-guilty-poster" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/presumed-guilty-poster.jpg?resize=214%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This item will not surprise orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>We all know how great a ban can be for business. Just ask Rabbi Nosson Kamenetsky or Rabbi Natan Slifkin how their sales were after their books were banned. Their books became collectors items!</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s no surprise that a documentary film banned by the Mexican government is soaring in popularity. The film is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/pov/presumedguilty/" target="_blank">Presumed Guilty</a>&#8221; and I have not seen it yet. So whatever I am writing is based on what I have read and heard from others.</p>
<p>The film is banned because it exposes the Mexican judicial system as a sham. Not only are the trials and proceedings full of injustices, the prison system is equally woeful and inhumane. The protagonist of the film has been excluded as a suspect by all forensic evidence, he has a legitimate alibi and the witness to the crime could not identify him. Yet, he was convicted and re-convicted in a corrupt legal system.</p>
<p>To avoid the embarrasment and the cries to reform the system, Mexico declared the movie illegal and its claims do not need to be addressed.<span id="more-4090"></span></p>
<p>The ban is always used in the same way. To avoid the substantive claims in a book or movie, authority dismisses the book or movie as illegal. That way they don&#8217;t have to deal with the claims.</p>
<p>Luckily, people are smarter than that. When something is banned, people want to know why. They want to know what was so offensive that deserved a ban. Usually, the contraband is found compelling and the people see through the veiled attempt by the authority to pretend that the flaws or issues in their own systems need addressing. If something is ban-worthy, it is probably making good points.</p>
<p>In the case of this movie, it is a point about justice.</p>
<p>In the cases of Rabbis Kamenetsky and Slifkin it was about the fallibility and humanness of rabbinic leaders.</p>
<p>All these examples make great points. If they are wrong, I would love to hear why. I would love to see some evidence to the contrary. But when something is banned and response is not necessary. A ban is the ultimove sign of weakness in authority. When their only defense is &#8220;you can&#8217;t see what they have to say about us&#8221;, their defense is not a defense at all.</p>
<p>The ban on Presumed Guilty has been lifted for the time being. It is back in theaters and DVD sales are soaring. For now&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back, Google did a video like this and it has become a sort of meme. It&#8217;s a cute meme. It takes some creativity and usually its pretty good.</p>
<p>Aish.com did a nice job with this story of the Exodus using the same style.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the story being told in a new medium and while remaining basically true to the text of the story.</p>
<p>So kudos to Aish, enjoy the video and enjoy your pre-Pesach preparations!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/typewriter.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4046" title="typewriter" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/typewriter.jpg?resize=300%2C265" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I read a fascinating article about an interesting phenomena in the NY Times.</p>
<p>Technology pervades our lives. Phones that have little computers inside them that can take lovely photos and videos, share them with the world, access the entire Internet and make a phone call live in our pockets. We have computers at home. We have computers at work. Many people use electronic devices to read books. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/12/23/orthodox-jews-and-e-readers/">Orthodox Jews and E-Readers</a>).</p>
<p>Some people feel like it has gone too far.</p>
<p>As a result, typewriters are surging in popularity. The unwieldy, noisy, with no delete button typewriters of the 40&#8217;s and 50&#8217;s. I am not that old, but when I was in 2nd grade I remember the school office secretary had a typewriter. But it was fancy and used a screen to show what you were typing, even had an automatic delete function and was not black metal. Those are not the popular typewriters. People want the old fashioned ones.<span id="more-4045"></span></p>
<p>A really nice point is made in the article by a Ms. Kowalski:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“You type so much quicker than you can think on a computer,” Ms. Kowalski said. “On a typewriter, you have to think.”</em></p>
<p>Writing on a computer is like using a pencil. Typing on a typewriter is using pen, or perhaps more like chiseling into a stone. Because we can type faster than we write, sometimes we write things that are incorrect, or stupid. The same thing happens when we speak before we consider the weight of our words. It can be a great exercise in cognition to type without the luxury of delete. I had a half a thought to publish this post in typewriter style, that is, without deleting or modifying anything. It would have been incoherent. I can barely write one sentence without making a correction or two, or three.</p>
<p>But the message is clear. Sometimes we do need to slow down.</p>
<p>Another great lesson I learned from the typewriter enthusiasts is the need to focus. Just while writing this blog post, I have checked and replied to email, replied to a Twitter conversation and commented on a Facebook post. There is something about using a uni-tasker. A typewriter can only do one thing. It helps one to focus and I suppose that is a good thing too.</p>
<p>The last thing I take from this typewriter revival is a bit of nostalgia. Some of us have it, some of us don&#8217;t. But in orthodox Jewish life there is much nostalgia. One of the greatest areas of this nostalgia is in the area of Torah study. Old books are treasured and revered. Old printings of those books are treasured and revered. Most significantly, old ideas are treasured and revered.</p>
<p>Using a book to study Torah is the standard. Torah scholars pore over books with ink and paper every day. Many of those texts are available digitally. But the old fashioned way lives on. When no one in the world is reading books anymore, I am positive that Torah will still be studied from books and read during services from scrolls. That nostalgia is built into Judaism. We revere the ancient, we respect the past, we look back to our parents and grand parents with love and admiration and we integrate all that into our present and future.</p>
<p>Personally, I love old things. Maybe one day I will get myself a typewriter, but until then I will need to practice typing more effectively the first time around&#8230;</p>

<p>We sometimes forget how fortunate we are. We have access to the greatest inventions, medical care, information, comfortable living conditions, every kind of food under the sun and things our great grandparents only could have dreamed of. Sure we have our probelms too. But our problems are mostly &#8220;<a href="http://therealfirstworldproblems.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">First World Problems</a>&#8220;. The Internet goes down during an epic Internet battle, our cell phone drops an important call, our takeout food is a bit soggy etc etc etc. These are First World Problems.</p>
<p>Around the world, others have Third World Problems. Dirty water, no medical care, hunger, extreme poverty, no electricity etc etc etc. Depending on where we are in the world, our problems are to varying degrees. The solutions to those problems depends on our ingenuity, willingness to think out of the box and creativity. Everywhere you go, people are dealing with whatever obstacles present themselves. Or sometimes people stagnate and resign themselves to their problems and don&#8217;t seek solutions. To me, that is failure.</p>
<p>Throughout history, Jewish people have use difficult situations to improve the world.<span id="more-4029"></span> In fact, the Talmud, one of the greatest gifts to mankind, is really a result of persectution. Due to the banning of Torah study and a lack of communication between various academies it became necessary to record the Talmud for posterity. Imagine if they had simply thrown in the towel and felt their impossible situation had no solution. The world would be a far darker place.</p>
<p>In our own lives we may be riddled with complications or issues and we don&#8217;t know how to extricate ourselves from our situation or fix what is broken. That is a sad place to be. We can all suffer from lack of inspiration at times. If you are feeling even just a tad uninspired I have the perfect way to jumpstart your creative juices. Watch this video.</p>
<p>On a floating village in Thailand called Koh Panyee the youth had nowhere to play soccer. But they needed an outlet. So they got creative and it paid off for them in a big way. The short film is based on the true story from 1986.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

Too many people are going hungry and there is much we can do to help. Sometimes all we need is a reminder. This excellent video is the perfect reminder.</p>
<p>So in your Passover preparations, remember those who are in need. There is an old Jewish custom called &#8220;Maos Chitim&#8221; to provide our less fortunate brethren with the funds needed to purchase Matza, wine and other seder necessities. Don&#8217;t forget to set aside some charity for those less fortunate this Pesach.</p>

<p>Three uniquely Jewish music styles in one concert. Three masters of their craft performing together. Three entertainers worth seeing on their own are performing together on one stage in Los Angeles on March 30 2011.</p>
<p>The Soul of Jewish Music with Itzhak Perlman, Cantor Yitzchok Meir Helfgot and a Klezmer Ensemble promises to be an amazing night of Jewish music. It is not often that classical, klezmer and cantorial music styles share a stage, but this concert will do just that.</p>
<p>Not to mention, one of my favorite comedians, Elon Gold will be performing as well. Elon performed for an organization I worked for previously and he was a huge hit. He is a TV star and stand-up comedy star and he tells some of the best &#8220;Jewish jokes&#8221; I have ever heard.</p>
<p>I hope I can get tickets for this event (they are expensive) and hope I can attend. If you live in Los Angeles, and can afford it, don&#8217;t miss it.<span id="more-3944"></span></p>
<p>If I sound excited it is because I am. And this is not a paid for or sponsored advertisement.</p>
<p>Tickets: <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/0B00466B14242BF3" target="_blank">Ticketmaster</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/team-photo-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3776" title="team-photo-1" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/team-photo-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Compton is one of the toughest neighborhoods in Los Angeles. It has been ranked as the 17th most dangerous city in America. Gangs are a part of daily life in Compton. The streets are run by ex-cons, cons and future cons. Drugs and death pervade the very air.</p>
<p>Gang life is usually not a choice for folks growing up in these neighborhoods. It&#8217;s like being born into a family. You&#8217;re in because you&#8217;re born in. It is extremely difficult to break free from the gangs. But it can be done.</p>
<p>I think it is obvious that providing non-violent outlets for youth is an important tool for helping youths avoid the gang lifestyle. <span id="more-3775"></span>The problem is that most &#8220;outlets&#8221; don&#8217;t create the family feel, structure and sense of belonging that a gang provides. The exception to that is sports. Being on a team, especially a good team feeds the same hunger that a gang feeds. Unfortunately, sports teams are also run over with gangs. The teams represent the gangs. The winners assert dominance over the losing gang.</p>
<p>On a deeper level there is another flaw with most sports as an alternative to gang life. Sports don&#8217;t really demand etiquette and respect. Trash talking is part of the game. Then there is the violence. Basketball, soccer and football, the most popular &#8220;pick up&#8221; sports in SoCal are rough and tough games. There is jostling, tackling, fouls and much contact between players. One could say that sports feed into the violent gang culture to a degree.</p>
<p>That is why this BBC report on a Cricket team from Compton is extra remarkable. Cricket has pageantry, etiquette and respect. It is the ultimate gentleman&#8217;s game. Somehow, the sport has caught on in Compton. The team has toured across the world drawing rave reviews from more experienced cricket teams in real cricket countries.</p>
<p>The team has been somewhat successful in getting kids off the streets but they have higher goals. They want to build a cricket field in Compton. I wish them the best of luck.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>
<p>Video off the BBC report:</p>

Not the baseball player who is cryogenically frozen, the homeless man turned Radio Personality and media darling.</p>
<p>His story is inspiring. But it&#8217;s also really depressing. Why?</p>
<p>The book / movie about Michael Oher (Go Ravens!), The Blind Side, tells the true story of a homeless, gentle giant who can play football. His background is typical for an inner city mionority. His parents were incapable of raising him or his siblings.</p>
<p>In the southern hospitality tradition, an affluent, influential family takes him in and raises him as their own. They help him with his school work and his football. Overall, he is a success and winds up in the NFL and an anchor player on a team that has been in the playoffs in each of his first two seasons. It&#8217;s a great story. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/039333838X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=039333838X&quot;&gt;The Blind Side (Movie Tie-in Edition)  (Movie Tie-in Editions)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=">Read the book</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VECM6S?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VECM6S">see the movie</a>. Either way, it&#8217;s a powerful story</p>
<p>What is the real message of the story?<span id="more-3630"></span> Leigh Anne Tuohy, the real woman who adopted Oher in real life says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There are a million Michaels. Not every kid has the potential to become a star player in the NFL, but that kid may be the person who grows up to cure cancer, or who becomes a great husband or wife to someone.</em></p>
<p>The &#8220;Michaels&#8221; are living in horrible conditions with little to no chance of discovering their gifts and talents. Theirs is a life of survival. And many do not.</p>
<p>The urban, gang riddled centers of our cities is sacrificing their youth. And lest you think it&#8217;s not YOUR problem, it is. The cure for cancer is in one of their potential lives. The next great discovery is being lost because so many of our youth don&#8217;t have the opportunity to hone their skills and talents.</p>
<p>There are a million Michaels. Their plight is a social problem that affects all of us. Too many intelligent, charismatic people are lost to the inner city.</p>
<p>Ted Williams is another exception. He was homeless. He had no shot at a better life. His talents would have remained hidden too. But he got lucky.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t rely on the good fortune which befell Micheal Oher and Ted Williams to save an entire generation of lost minds.</p>
<p>I will never forget the enduring message of the ubiquitous <a href="http://www.adcouncil.org/default.aspx?id=134">PSA</a> from the United Negro College Fund. &#8220;<em>A mind is a terrible thing to waste</em>&#8220;. When I was a kid, I heard that slogan a million times. One time for each of the million Michaels.</p>
<p>A mind <strong><em>is</em></strong> a terrible thing to waste. Yet, as a society, we do it all the time&#8230;</p>
<p>To me, that is the real, and depressing, message of the Ted Williams story.</p>
<p>Here is the original UNCF PSA:</p>

<p>If you know me well, you will not be surprised that I protested the early release of this video by not watching it until a few moments ago. It&#8217;s a great video. Google uses their products in a bit of justifiable self promotion to remind us of what we searched for on the Internet this year. The production quality is excellent. The content is even better. The video moved me and I think it will move you as well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad Google made this video and I am happy to share it with you.</p>
<p>Just think, you never know who or what will change to world. Next year, it could be you&#8230;</p>
<p>Have a great New Year&#8217;s and see you in 2011.<span id="more-3581"></span></p>

<p>I was asked what I felt about the repeal of Don&#8217;t Ask Don&#8217;t Tell. Short answer: It&#8217;s about time.</p>
<p>DADT made it illegal for anyone who was openly gay to join the military. It also prohibited military recruiters from asking potential military enlistees about their sexuality.</p>
<p>Perhaps 17 years ago this was a step forward, today it is a backwards policy.</p>
<p>A policy that so blatantly discriminated against a significant portion of our country&#8217;s citizens and told them that they were not welcome to assist in the defense of their own country is a bad policy. No matter where one stands on the issue of gay rights and gay marriage, there is no legitimate reason to exclude those who are gay from proudly serving their country.<span id="more-3516"></span></p>
<p>In the United States it is not a crime to be gay. It should not hinder one&#8217;s ability to be a patriot either.</p>
<p>I understand that the military may be a slightly hostile place to those who are gay. That is an issue that gay soldiers will need to deal with. They are used to be outsiders and I am sure they will be just fine in the military.</p>
<p>As the president said today: &#8220;We are a nation of &#8216;<em>out of many, come one</em>&#8216;&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am proud to be one of the many.</p>
<p>Watch the singing below. If you don&#8217;t care for the speeches and just want to see the actual &#8220;John Hancock&#8221; skip to the end around the 25 minute mark.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t play every day and when I play I only play for a few minutes. I am by no means addicted or obsessed. But I do recognize that many of you out there ARE addicted and obsessed. People play Angry Birds at an irrational rate.</p>
<p>Even if Angry Birds is played at an irrational rate there are some good questions that need answering about the saga of the Angry Birds. I get why they are angry &#8211; they lost their eggs, but pretty much the rest of the game requires a tremendous suspension of disbelief.</p>
<p>Important questions get asked and unfortunately, are unanswered in the video below.<span id="more-3437"></span></p>
<p>The video reminded me that just because something is an accepted truth, does not mean it should not be questioned.</p>
<p>It better to have a question with no answer than not to have asked at all.</p>
<p>And sometimes you need just one member of a community to simply ask &#8220;why&#8221; and think out of the box to foster change and growth.</p>
<p>And sometimes that member never enjoys the results of their questioning&#8230;</p>
<p>That is a universal lesson.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal has a nice piece on Dr. Jonathan Halpert. He is the YU basketball coach of 39 years. That is a long time to be doing any job. Certainly in a field dominated by the coaching carousel, it is a worthy achievement.</p>
<p>The article is nice. It tells of the challenges of managing a team of Orthodox Jewish basketball players. Shabbos and Holidays are off limits to games and practices. The daily grind of a YU student includes religious studies until mid afternoon and then secular classes that can go until 8 PM.</p>
<p>Halpert gives the reader insight into his coaching and life philosophy and as a reader I found him to be inspiring.<span id="more-3420"></span></p>
<p>In the article, there is one anecdote about making an impact on a player&#8217;s life.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There was the player who was cut but served as team manager for a year, made the squad the following season and hit a game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. Dr. Halpert made five DVDs of the game for the player to show to his children. &#8220;That&#8217;s good to keep you going another five years,&#8221; he said.</em></p>
<p>A nice story. But even nicer because I happen to know that player.</p>
<p>That player is Aryeh Magilnick. Son of PJC members <strong>Judd</strong> and <strong>Denise Magilnick</strong>.</p>
<p>And I happen to know what shot Halpert was referring to. And now you do too.</p>
<p>Click the video to watch Aryeh Magilnick hit a classic buzzer beater. (Assume there is a buzzer and that the shot was released just before the buzzer sounded.)</p>
