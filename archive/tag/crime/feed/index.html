<p>You may recall that I a little while ago I met and befriended an incarcerated woman named Judith Clark. See: <a title="Permanent link to My Visit With Judith Clark at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility" href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/29/my-visit-with-judith-clark-at-bedford-hills-prison/" rel="bookmark">My Visit With Judith Clark at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility</a>.</p>
<p>Judy is a Jewish woman who is serving a 75 year prison sentence for her role as a getaway driver in a famous Brinks truck robbery in my hometown of Monsey NY that left several men dead, some 30 years ago. The robbery was for the benefit of a far-left extremist group. Her sentence was severe and it was mostly because she treated the trial as an opportunity to make anti-government statements. She viewed herself as a martyr for her cause and did not cooperate during the proceedings.</p>
<p>Supporters of Judy were hoping for clemency last December. When that did not come, many of us were very disappointed. It seemed that her best chance at freedom had passed her by.</p>
<p>You may ask, why I would support clemency for a woman who played a role in several deaths.<span id="more-5036"></span> The short answer is that I don&#8217;t. The woman I met, the woman I support, is absolutely a different woman that the woman who participated in those heinous acts three decades prior. The Judy Clark from 1981 has been transformed into a new and improved Judy Clark. A woman, who by all accounts, gives every indication that she has been rehabilitated. Even the most cynical view is that she &#8220;only reformed herself to get out of prison&#8221;. But there is no doubt she has reformed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rare case, where a person actually changes for the better while prison. It&#8217;s at least as rare as people who change their lives while not in prison. And we all know how hard and rare it is to change one&#8217;s life. Supporting Judy Clark is supporting the human spirit and its ability to improve. It is supporting a woman with an infectious smile and important message despite her shortcomings. I support a woman who admits her mistakes, regrets them very much and tries tirelessly to make a positive difference in others.</p>
<p>The article in the NY Times magazine is an in-depth look at Judy, her circumstances and her supporters. Two of those supporters mentioned in the article have become friends of mine through Judy. If you want a full picture of what happened in 1981, what happened in the 30 years since and the reactions from across the spectrum of supporters and opponents of Judy I strongly suggest reading the article.</p>
<p>Most of all, I urge you to consider what our justice system should do when someone in prison genuinely changes their life. When someone does <em>teshuva</em> and repents for what they have done, how long must they suffer for their previous errors?</p>

(And a challenge to all the frum sites and newspapers to publish this summary.)</em></p>
<p><em>For a couple years now, the &#8220;frum&#8221; news sites and papers have reported a whitewashed version of the Rubashkin case. This has caused foolish outrage, claims of anti-Semitism, calls for the lives of the judges who presided over the appeal, condemnation of the criminal justice system and a gross double standard / hypocritical view of justice. All the frum media has been able to learn from this episode is not to trust the government and that we are a few logical steps away from Nuremberg Laws being applied to America. I have not seen one mainstream news article or editorial on honesty in business. Not one. This is understandable, because in the eyes of the frum community, Rubashkin is the victim of a blood libel and a contemporary Dreyfuss. In my opinion, this is reprehensible. We lose credibility as a community when we are not honest. But more importantly we are missing the greater lesson in all of this. Don&#8217;t break the law.</em></p>
<p><em> All the while, the frum community is footing the bill. (For an excellent review of why this case is not Pidyon Shvuyim I recommend an article written by Dovid Lichtenstein in the Spring 2011 issue of Hakira.)</em></p>
<p><em>This post is an attempt to set the record straight. Everything in this post is public record. Everything in this post is based on facts. There is no opinion in this post.</em><span id="more-4635"></span></p>
<p><em>Rubashkin got a raw deal. He is a victim of a very punitive system. The system is imperfect. But those flaws do not kasher the reality of what happened. For more on my personal outrage over the extreme sentence levied against Rubashkin please read this: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/06/22/27-years-is-a-harsh-sentence-but-not-the-only-harsh-sentence/">27 Years Is A Harsh Sentence But Not The Only Harsh Sentence</a></em></p>
<p>What follows is free of compassion or vendetta. It is an attempt to portray pure fact. Please feel free to reference this post when discussing the case with others:</p>
<p>Rubashkin was convicted of 86 counts of bank, wire, mail fraud making false statements to a bank, money laundering and violations of an order from the Secretary of Agriculture. His sentence was 324 months (27 years) which was on the low side of the guidelines.</p>
<p>In 1999 Agri opened a line of credit with First Bank Business Capital. To secure the loan, Agri offered its inventory and accounts receivable as collateral. Meaning, the bank gave the loan assuming that Agri was making a certain amount of money. Showing a greater number in accounts receivable would increase the credit line and increase the risk for the bank. The loan was for about $30 million daily in 2008.</p>
<p>Agri inflated its accounts receivable in two ways. First, they fabricated invoices to increase the accounts receivable. These were not errors. They were deliberate. Some of the false invoices were to accounts that prepaid Agri, so no invoices were needed. Others were to accounts that sold no meat like a clothing store. Others reflected balances on accounts paid in full. Others just inflated the amounts owed. The court estimates that these false invoices fraudulently increased Agri&#8217;s credit line by $10 million.</p>
<p>The second way Agri inflated it&#8217;s account receivables was by depositing money that was supposed to be paid to the receivable account into a separate account. This gave the bank the impression that the receivable account was still owed more money than it was actually owed.</p>
<p>Also, Agri would pay down the loan with money that came into their account from the bank. Agri would take money from the operating account, deposit it into the Yeshiva which was funded by Rubashkin and a local kosher market. The school and market would write checks back to Agri and they were deposited into the bank account designated for accounts receivable. The bank would see these deposits and assume the money coming in was genuine income. This fraud gave Agri an additional $3 million in credit that was obtained fraudulently.</p>
<p>These acts were the basis for the money laundering charges.</p>
<p>Finally, the bank&#8217;s agreement with Agri required that Agri comply with the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921. It did not comply with the Act so the loan was continued fraudulently.</p>
<p>The records of these acts of fraud date back to <strong>January 2008</strong>. Months before the raid on Agri for immigration charges.</p>
<p>The records of money laundering begin in <strong>November 2007</strong>. Again, far in advance of the raid on Agri for immigration charges.</p>
<p>In May 2008, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raided Agri and arrested almost 400 hundred employees for immigrations violations. Around that time Agri was notified that it was the also the target of a federal investigation for financial crimes.</p>
<p>In November 2008, Rubashkin was arrested and indicted on 163 counts. The aforementioned fraud related counts and 69 counts of harboring undocumented aliens for profit and variety of other escalations like conspiracy and aiding and abetting.</p>
<p>For efficiency, the court split the fraud related counts and the immigration counts. It decided to try the financial crimes first. Rubashkin objected. The court proceeded regardless.</p>
<p>One of the employees arrested in the raid asked that the judge (the Honorable Linda Reade) be recused from his immigration case because she was involved in the logistics of preparing the courts for the barrage of arraignments and cases following the raid. Literally, hundreds of defendants were tried in makeshift court rooms. The Chief Judge was needed to make the necessary arrangements. The court acknowledged involvement but as Chief Judge this involvement was minimal, necessary and not prejudicial.</p>
<p>Rubashkin&#8217;s trial team was aware of this issue and aware of the court&#8217;s deicision not to recuse itself from the other trial and did not pursue the matter further during trial. A deadline for recusal motions was also set. No motions were made by Rubashkin&#8217;s lawyers before the deadline.</p>
<p>The kind of conduct that the court deems grounds for recusal has been found in two situations cited by the court. In one case the U.S. Attorney who was investigating the case <em>became</em> the judge. He was required to recuse. In a second case, the judge actually met with prosecutors and <em>assisted</em> them with their case before the grand jury. Mere knowledge of the raid and logistical assitance in setting up the necessary arrangements for en masse criminal trial after the raid does not rise to the level requiring recusal.</p>
<p>During the trial for the financial crimes some evidence of the immigration violations that were considered relevant to the fraud was introduced. Some of the charges in the fraud case were predicated on Agri&#8217;s statement that it was not &#8220;in violation of any law, statute, regulation… which . . . would in any respect materially and adversely affect the collateral . . . or [Agri&#8217;s] property, business, operations, or condition.&#8221; Since, the Bank&#8217;s collateral would be severely affected if Agri was violating immigration laws, and Agri <em>was</em> violating immigration laws, these violations formed the basis for 5 courts of fraud.</p>
<p>It has been argued that since Rubashkin was not convicted of immigration violations, the court should not have considered the immigration violations in the fraud case. The court argues that this is irrelevant. Individuals working for Rubashkin were convicted of immigration violations and were under his supervision. Rubashkin is culpable for those convictions as well.</p>
<p>The 27 year sentence has also been challenged. The prosecution and Rubashkin disagree on the amount of loss caused by the fraud. According to prosecutors the amount is $27 million and according to the defense it is $12 million. (Side note: this means that Rubashkin acknowledges that he is guilty of at least a $12 million fraud).</p>
<p>Rubashkin&#8217;s number is assessed by calculated how much extra money the bank lent him based in his fraud. The prosecution&#8217;s number is arrived at by calculating that number plus the default that Agri owed on the loan. The test to determine which number is used is a &#8220;foreseeabiiity test&#8221;. The court held that is was foreseeable that borrowing $12 million fraudulently would result in a default. Since it is foreseeable, the court properly considered that number when assessing the fraud.</p>
<p>As the to sentence, 324 months was on the low end of the range. The sentence was mitigated by Rubashkin&#8217;s circumstances as a father, first time offender and philanthropist. Without those factors the sentence would have been greater.</p>
<p>Another factor was Rubashkin&#8217;s lack of remorse during the trial. The perception of the court reflected the outrage of the community. In the orthodox Jewish community, Rubashkin was elevated to hero status as if he had done no wrong. This was consistent with Rubashkin&#8217;s refusal to cooperate with the government in their investigation and other trials. It also stands in stark contrast to other white collar criminals and even other defendants arising out the raid of Agri in November 2008.</p>
<p>Letters on behalf of Rubashkin were written by U.S. Attorney Generals and others. Their letters focused on the unfairness of the guidelines. They did not say Rubashkin was not guilty. They did not say that Rubashkin did not get a fair trial. They did not say the case was an example of anti-Semitism. Their complaint was limited to the general harshness of the sentencing guidelines. They did not say the guidelines were misapplied. They limited their criticism to the guidelines using Rubashkin&#8217;s case as an example of why the guidelines must be changed.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 90% of Federal cases settle. This is because the Feds rarely indict unless they are sure they are going to win. Of the 10% of cases that do not settle, the Feds win about 90% of those. One in a hundred Federal cases is won by the defendant. Rubashkin&#8217;s lawyers knew the score. If he had settled and entered a guilty plea and cooperated his sentence would likely have been 5 years or less (this is pure speculation but based on conversations with defense attorneys and prosecutors).</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will be posting my theory as to why Rubashkin has the blind support of the community. Stay tuned. (That post is going to be opinion) <img src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=980" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>Without getting to far afield in the nitty gritty of the local politics, there is an election for a seat in Congress representing the 36th Congressional District on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Democratic candidate is Janice Hahn. She appeared to be a shoo-in for the seat in a fairly moderate to liberal district. One particular issue has turned the tides of the race and created a virtual heat heading into the final weekend.</p>
<p>The issue (this is as &#8220;neutral point of view&#8221; I can put it) is Hahn&#8217;s policies with regard to gang members. In particular she facilitated the placement of criminals as gang interventionists and had them paid via a third party.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to see how this is being portrayed negatively. Or more to the point, why this is being portrayed negatively. <span id="more-4404"></span>The biggest crime issue in Los Angeles is gangs. One of the more effective ways of curbing gang violence is negotiating peace treaties. I met the fellow who negotiated the truce between the Bloods and Crips. It took almost 10 years to form an agreement. (His name is Aquila Sherrils.) Hahn enlisted the help of some senior gang members to negotiate for peace between gangs. These representatives were paid by football legend Jim Brown&#8217;s foundation. She also strongly supported programs to help gang members receive recognition for changing their lives. All of this seems very good.</p>
<p>Yet, Fox LA ran a nearly 10 minute segment on Janice Hahn&#8217;s &#8220;horrifying&#8221; involvement with gang members. The bias and slant in this report is embarrassing (for them) and an indictment on the public. If the public does not want to see programs and initiative such as Ms. Hahn&#8217;s what do they want? If working from within gangs to promote peace treaties is a bad idea, what is a good idea? If it is seen as a blemish on ones record for thinking creatively and bravely about how to solve the gang problems what would a sparkling record look like?</p>
<p>This report has me so upset at Fox, the public and the organizers of Hahn&#8217;s opponent&#8217;s campaign who are text messaging the entire district about this horrible report. Note, the report makes no accusations of wrongdoing or impropriety. It is simply the concept that Hahn is helping gang members that is so obscene that it renders her am unqualified conduct. As one website promoting Hahn&#8217;s indiscretions put it: Hahn is directing public funds to &#8220;support violent, inner-city criminals&#8221;.<br />
Disgraceful.</p>
<p>Tell me what you think.</p>

<p>Recent developments in the Dominique Strauss-Kahn case and the Casey Anthony acquittal raise some real issues with our criminal justice system.</p>
<p>When the public thinks it knows if a person committed a crime, the public wants that person apprehended, tried, convicted and sentenced. The public does not have much patience for the investigations, lengthy pre-trial periods, acquittals or light sentences.They reason, &#8220;if we know they are guilty, just put them away&#8221;, &#8220;if they get away with it, it&#8217;s a travesty&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, very often, even when the public is convinced of guilt and culpability, the justice system fails the public. Charges are dropped, bail is reduced, juries acquit, sentences are meek.</p>
<p>To the public this is all very wrong.<span id="more-4393"></span></p>
<p>This demonstrates the huge disconnect between the actual justice system and the perceived justice system. The public thinks that if someone did something wrong then they should be and will be punished. That is simply not even close to true. First of all, many people who do nothing wrong get punished anyway. Further, committing a crime does not mean one is guilty by law. Guilt by law is determined by evidence and believability. The Anthony and Strauss-Kahn cases show quite clearly that without real evidence and with non-credible complaining witness, the case will fall apart. This is regardless of whether the crime was committed by the defendant.</p>
<p>To the public this means the court got it wrong. But really it did not. The court has a much higher bar for conviction than the public has. That is a good thing not a bad thing.</p>
<p>The Anthony and Strauss-Kahn cases also demonstrate that with good lawyers (or poor prosecution) and preparation, any case can be won by the defense. This exposes one of the true flaws in the justice system. Some people are more well represented than others. Lower class defendants charged with the same crimes are far more likely to plead them out or go to trial and find that jurors are far less sympathetic to defendants with gang affiliation and tattoos up and down their bodies. Perceptions matter. Looks matter. Social class matters. But those things should not matter.</p>
<p>The public doesn&#8217;t really care about these things. But they should. These are issues that create inequality in our justice system. That high bar for conviction seems to work in favor of certain people. Not all people.</p>
<p>The problems in the Strauss-Kahn and Anthony cases are problems in many cases that result in convictions. It just doesn&#8217;t happen to middle and upper class people. So the public doesn&#8217;t know about it. Or worse, the public doesn&#8217;t care.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/prohibition.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4368" title="prohibition" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/prohibition.jpg?resize=238%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It&#8217;s been almost 40 years. Is that long enough for a war?</p>
<p>Whenever one begins a war one needs to consider the exit strategies. This was a fatal flaw in Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. I believe it is also a fatal flaw in the one war being fought on American soil: The War on Drugs.</p>
<p><span>It is hard to consider what was thought of as the end game of this war when it began. Was the end of the war going to be some utopian time where no one used drugs? Was it when all the drug users were in prison? How would winning this war look?</span></p>
<p>We can ponder those questions because we know with certainty what losing this war looks like.</p>
<p>I asked a public defender who works in felonies what percentage of their cases are small time drug charges (not drug king pin charges). Her response? 90%. 90%! Nine out of ten people being processed by our criminal justice system for serious crimes were busted for drugs.<span id="more-4367"></span></p>
<p>Felony drug charges can be filed for tiny amounts of drugs (like enough for a couple &#8220;highs&#8221;).</p>
<p><span>The prisons are bursting with drug criminals. It costs $40,000 a year to incarcerate someone for 1 year. 1 year! It costs untold amounts of money and energy to arrest, prosecute and defend these drug criminals. It is very easy for police to arrest drug users. They go to the neighborhood and &#8220;sell&#8221; drugs to addicts. Their partner arrests the users a moment later. They can arrest 100 people in a day like that. They go through the criminal justice system and weigh down the system.</span></p>
<p>The selective prosecution of immigrants and under-privileged drug users is horrifying. At frat parties across the country drugs are used with no consequence. The hobo who gets high goes to prison for a few months, years, decades even life. Three drug arrests and convictions can lead to life in prison (or more accurately death in prison). If someone who is undocumented gets picked up for a drug charge, even if the drug charge is dropped or fabricated they can be deported. Losing fathers, brothers, mothers and sisters to the drug war only increases the social problems in lower class neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks there has been an encouraging development, more and more news articles have appeared in the media calling for an end to the drug war.</p>
<p>First, The Guardian reported that world leaders were calling for an end to the international drug war. The names associated with the Global Commission on Drug Policy&#8217;s push come from all over the world. The problem exists internationally to the point that the US sends $1.4 billion in aid to Mexico and Central American nations to wage their drug wars at home. The commission is calling for decriminalization and legal regulation.</p>
<p>Then, in The Atlantic, I saw a great line from David Simon, creator of The Wire, which really told to story of the drug war to the people. The show is based on the real drug war in downtown Baltimore. It accurately portrays the many issues with the drug war. For some reason, Eric Holder asked for another season of The Wire. Simon said he would be happy to consider it if the administration was ready to reconsider its current stance on the drug war.</p>
<p>Next, President Jimmy Carter weighed in with his endorsement for ending the drug war. Citing the great work of the aforementioned international group, Carter turns the issue into a political one and talks about how great he was and how bad Reagan was. But there are some worthwhile points in his Op-Ed. For example, in California 11% of the budget goes to prisons and 7.5% goes to higher education. He calls on the American government to adopt the strategies of the Global Commission on Drug Policy.</p>
<p><span>Perhaps the most important factor is that Americans from all political ideologies can agree on this. Conservatives want to spend less money on drug enforcement. Liberals want to even the playing field for under-privileged folks and libertarians don&#8217;t want the government telling people what they can and cannot do.</span></p>
<p>We can all agree on this issue. Doesn&#8217;t it make sense to stop fighting about things we will never agree on for just a few minutes to end the War on Drugs? It seems to me that we can actually get some good work done if we would fix the things we agree about.</p>
<p>What should the drug policy be? Same as alcohol. Indoors only. Sold and taxed. Public intoxication or endangerment to others would be illegal.</p>
<p>What would happen? The courts would be less burdened. Our prisons would be mostly empty (and humane). The police and the citizens in their neighborhoods would have a less adversarial relationship due to less arrests and less fake drug sales. Police could return to more wholesome police work. Our local and federal government would have money to spend on much more important projects. We all win.</p>
<p>End this war.</p>

The NFL is currently undergoing a labor dispute. The owners want more money, the players want more money and the result is that the owners have locked the players out and until the dispute is resolved there will be no football.</p>
<p>In an interview Ray Lewis made the claim that if there is no football crime will increase. (See: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6575570" target="_blank">ESPN</a>)</p>
<p>Using reason, logic, common sense etc. his statement may be a little bit offensive but I think it rings true. NFL games keep people busy on Sunday. If there is no football people might be bored, or even angry that there are no games to watch. Boredom and anger can contribute to an increase in crime. At the time, most people thought was Lewis said was crazy, offensive or just wrong. I wasn&#8217;t so sure.</p>
<p>But now there is data.</p>
<p>The data shows that Lewis is wrong. Maybe.<span id="more-4364"></span> On bye weeks, when there is no local football game, crime has not been shown to increase in the local market. I am not so sure how valuable that statistic is because there is still football and football fans like to watch other games besides for their home team. Another statistic shows that crime is not higher or lower before or after the season. This seems to show Lewis is incorrect as well. However it does not consider the anger factor mentioned above. Another statistic showed that the week before the Super Bowl, when no football is played, also did not result in increased criminal activity. Again, this is not a useful statistic in my opinion because football fans have plenty to watch on TV as the experts dissect the game and give their analysis in the week leading up to the Super Bowl. Plus no anger.</p>
<p>The only possibly meaningful statistic I saw was the relatively modest bump in homicides during the 1982 NFL players strike. Aside from the slight increase in homicides there was no increased criminal activity. However, a 30 year old statistic is also difficult to rely on as the popularity of the NFL is at unprecedented levels. More people care and rely on the weekly games for entertainment than ever before. So it is entirely possible that the 1982 statistic means nothing in 2011 as well.</p>
<p>In short, Ray Lewis might be right and he might be wrong. The statistics being cited are not conclusive in my opinion. Until the season is supposed to start we can argue about it in theory. But if the lockout continues and the season does not start, there will be no need to prognosticate. We can just observe the crime levels week by week.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping there is a season and we don&#8217;t need to prove Lewis right or wrong.</p>

<p>This is what the shoe feels like when it&#8217;s on the other foot.</p>
<p>For decades, right-wing / republican / conservative / Judeo-Christian Valuists have talked a big game when it comes to fighting crime. Running on &#8220;Law and Order&#8221; platforms and promising harsh sentences for criminals was a sure way to gain support.</p>
<p>On the other hand, bleeding heart liberals have been trying to model the justice system after the softer Euro sentencing structures.</p>
<p>Traditionally, middle class white people support Law and Order style justice. Harsh sentences make them feel safer and they are less likely to know someone who will be incarcerated, thus they are removed from the effects of the harsh sentencing of criminals.</p>
<p>Lower class folks usually support softer punishments.<span id="more-2572"></span> They are the ones who are more likely to have friends and relatives in the justice system. For many of them, the softer the punishment, the sooner they get their daddy back.</p>
<p>It was real easy for us middle class white (Jewish) people to support strict sentencing guidelines when it didn&#8217;t really affect us. But after witnessing one of our own fall prey to the system we helped create I am sure we all feel differently. (Of course I am aware that there are some middle class white Jews who vote democrat and support liberal causes, I am talking to everyone else.)</p>
<p>27 years is a long time. Rubashkin is a crook but his sentence is very harsh. We now feel what lower class communities have felt for so long. Some of us now think the system is out to get us. They have felt that way all along. Some of us now are horrified by the sentencing guidelines and the leeway given to particularly strict judges. They have been saying this is a problem all along.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time for our community to more fully support softer punishments for all criminals. In some states (like mine &#8211; California) we are spending millions and millions of dollars locking up &#8220;3 Strikes&#8221; criminals for LIFE (including non-violent, minor felonies). That is even harsher than Rubashkin&#8217;s sentence. If we are outraged over his sentence let that outrage spill over into more socially conscious, activist role and help modify our current justice system.</p>
<p>But please, for intellectual honesty&#8217;s sake, be consistent. If you think Rubashkin got a raw deal, do some research and learn about how other people who made mistakes in their teens will spend their entire lives in jail because of America&#8217;s love of retribution. Help everyone who got shafted by the system and let&#8217;s try and prevent this from happening again, to anyone.</p>

<h2>A Guest Post By The Thief</h2>
<p></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/08/can-criminals-change-their-ways-introduction-to-the-thief/" target="_blank">Introduction here</a>.</p>
<p>I used to be a thief. Let me tell you my story.</p>
<p>As a child I always played by my own rules. My mother would often say that I danced to the beat of a different band. A different drum was not enough to describe my differences, no, I needed a full band.</p>
<p>My career as a thief started when I was about 5 years old. At-least, that was the first time I remember recognizing that I was a thief. Perhaps I started earlier, but it just did not have the same impression on myself. <span id="more-1988"></span>I was taken to the doctors office, and after the visit, we had to buy some medicine from the pharmacy/gift-shop. This was a normal activity at the time, and I decided to walk around the store and explore. At some point, I found a rack of key-chains, and one of them was a “working” pirate gun. An old dragoon. I played with it and when it was time to go, my mother called me and I ran out of the store as instructed. When I got into the car and my mother asked me how I was feeling, I was about to answer “Great, this new toy is lots of fun.” But I stopped myself, because it dawned on me, that I had not asked my parents if I could have this toy key-chain, nor did we go to the front of the store and buy it. I realized suddenly that I had -stolen- this toy. I debated if I should tell my parents so they could return it. However, I did not feel it was fair to make them turn around and ruin their day. This is important for later, but I was very big on the idea of fairness. If something wasn&#8217;t fair, I&#8217;d make a big fuss about it. So I kept the toy and marveled at how easy it was to accidentally steal something.</p>
<p>Time went on, I lived a normal life, but every once in a while I would see something that I liked, but would not be allowed to have it, or I saw something laying around “just asking to be taken.” I would steal little things, like coins and cheap Chinese toys, or I would steal toys from my friends and return it back later. I <em>never got caught</em> stealing anything. There were two reasons for this. 1) I learned early on by example, that people got in trouble when they looked guilty. Kids running away from smashing a window always got caught. Thieves and bad guys in movies always run away from the police. However, if you didn&#8217;t look guilty, nobody looked twice. 2) I never actually felt guilty about stealing anything. I always had a good reason to take the item, and if anyone ever seemed sad that something was gone, I would return it to them in the same way I took it. All without them noticing.</p>
<p>By the time I was in my tweens, I was got pretty good at this stealing thing. I remember one time my friend had gotten caught for trying to steal a leather jacket from a department store. It was his first time stealing anything, and I was surprised that he got caught or found it difficult. To me, only people who tried robbery (with a weapon) or felt guilty about stealing, ever got caught. His punishments meant nothing to me. I even used my gift of stealing to get girls gifts in my school. They thought I was the nicest person and that I must have rich parents. It felt really good to be a thief, and the best part was that nobody knew it.</p>
<p>Eventually, I got really close to some of the girls that I would steal things for and I had to confess to them that I did not buy them gifts, but rather I stole them. At first she did not believe me. She was shocked, and was certain I was just making up stories. We were at an amusement park at the time, and so I told her that I would show her how easy it is to steal things, and that people really don&#8217;t care if something is stolen or not. I asked her what she wanted me to steal, and she pointed to <a href="https://www.barrysmagicshop.com/images/invisible%20dog%20leash.jpg" target="_blank">one of those invisible dog walking leashes</a> saying that it was too large to hide in my shirt, and so I would never get away with it. I accepted the challenge happily. I explained to her my two theories about stealing, and calmly and casually walked up to the store, took the leash and left the building, pointed out to some strangers how fun the toy was, and danced loudly back to the girl I was with. She could not understand it. And I explained again, that if act as if you are doing nothing wrong, nobody else will think you are doing anything wrong either. Being a thief was not about wearing black clothing and sneaking around, it did not require any magical sleight-of-hand skills. All that was needed was confidence, and an awareness of how well protected an item was from being stolen. In my mind, if the owner did not make it difficult for me to steal the item, then obviously they did not mind if it was stolen in the first place. At the end of the day, she asked me to throw the leash away and I did, not thinking anything of it. It didn&#8217;t really fit in the car anyway.</p>
<p>Years later, there was another girl. I was in the store with her, and she wanted some glow in the dark thing. Can&#8217;t remember what it was exactly, but I otherwise remember this incident clearly because it was the first time I ever had to justify my theft to another person. I told her I would buy it for her , but when I looked at the price tag it was much more than I thought it should cost. I was outraged. I turned to her and said that this was not fair. The item probably cost $0.05 to make, and they were selling it for over $2.00! This injustice could not go unpunished. And so I stole the item for her, and a few other items that one might find at a rave or in a room with a black light. This girl, unlike the other one, was really upset with me. She would not stand for me stealing things. She told me I had to go back and return the items, and if I wasn&#8217;t willing to pay for the item then we were best not having them. And so this resulted in a long conversation between the girl and myself. Here is a summary of the conversation.</p>
<p>She told me that stealing was wrong, because if everybody stole, nobody would make anything. I replied, that the store was stealing from everybody who paid so much for those items, and I was restoring justice by stealing back. Besides, not everybody has the guts to steal I had learned, and so I was not worried that everybody was going to go around stealing. She responded by asking me how I would feel if my stuff was stolen. I told her that my stuff doesn&#8217;t get stolen, because I look out for it, and if it does get stolen, its probably because I didn&#8217;t mind if it got stolen anyway. The conversation ended, and I was never able to be really friendly with her again after that. It was the only time in my life I regretted being a thief, because I thought I had a chance to be with her otherwise. (As an aside years later my first and favorite car stolen. I was surprised when I was only upset that I had no way to get to and from school and was not upset about the theft itself. In fact I felt like I deserved it, and felt good at having &#8216;Divine Justice&#8217; thrust upon me.)</p>
<p>A few months after these incidents, I started to learn more about Judaism and to study it seriously and my career as a thief came to an end. While I never planned any heists, nor did I steal any cars or get involved with gangs, I definitely stole thousands of dollars worth of junk. Anything that was overpriced, not worth my money, or was to be given to other people was stolen. I was doing the world a service and using my god given talents to restore justice and balance in the world. I felt good about myself, and was impressed with my talents.</p>

Crime is ugly. It hurts the victims and negatively affects the criminal&#8217;s life forever. Families can be shattered and communities can be destroyed by crime.</p>
<p>The system we have today only looks at the criminal. The goal of our criminal justice system is to incapacitate criminals and punish them for their acts. Little systematic rehabilitation is offered to criminals and consequently there is a high rate of recidivism in our prisons. We hope that punishing criminals will deter them and future criminals from pursuing a life of crime. Unfortunately, crime persists and criminals continue to crop up.<span id="more-1982"></span></p>
<p>There is also research that shows that a criminal is hard wired psychologically with tendencies to commit crime as early as the age of five. It is very tough battle for the criminal justice system to fight when going head to head with ingrained psychological pathologies. It seems there is little hope for a system wide effort to change criminals into contributing members of society.</p>
<p>It is clear that our current system accomplishes one important goal. It maintains order. If not for the justice system chaos would rule the day as people with no care for right or wrong would be able to wreak havoc unfettered. The criminal justice system helps maintain order and some semblance of safety. It may not be a perfect system but in this regard it is the best we have.</p>
<p>While studying Criminal Law at Law School I also studied the <a href="http://www.lls.edu/programs/religiouslaw/adlerstein.html" target="_blank">Loyola Law School course on Jewish Law</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchok_Adlerstein" target="_blank">Rabbi Adlerstein</a>. The focus of the course was dual. On one hand we studied much of the substantive law on subjects such as helping  distressed motorist, finding lost objects, justifiable homicide and abortion, criminal procedure and many other interesting topics in Jewish Law. On the other hand we learned about a system of rules designed to prevent crime and to create a more perfect society. When Jewish Law was THE law it effectively deterred criminals and focused on the criminal making the victims whole again as opposed to retribution of the criminal. This contrasts sharply with the criminal justice system in western society.</p>
<p>This semester I am hoping to be taking the Restorative Justice Seminar at Loyola with Professor Wood. (I say hoping because it depends on some administrative decisions that are out of my control.) The Restorative Justice concept is similar in some ways to the Jewish Law concept. It focuses on the totality of the crime, not just the criminal and it hopes to help rehabilitate criminals at least in some capacity. I am looking forward to learning more about Restorative Justice (hopefully).</p>
<p>All this discussion about crime and if there is a system that can deter crime is very important. We all want a more productive society. Less crime means less resources spent on deterring and punishing crime. More importantly it give more people the opportunity to be productive members of society. Perhaps most importantly, there are no hurt victims.  Yet, much of it is theory as the system in place now is not changing dramatically any time soon.</p>
<p>However, I recently came across a self professed thief who changed his ways. This fellow stole thousands of dollars worth of various items for most of his life. This all began when he was about 5 years old. This is line with the research mentioned above. This fellow never got caught. He was never subject to the criminal justice system and yet, somehow, he turned it all around.</p>
<p>Can we learn from his story? Is there a system that can help criminals adjust their behavior? Does it require punishment?</p>
