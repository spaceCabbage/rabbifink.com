				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7319" alt="images" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images.jpeg" width="275" height="183" /></a>The USA Today reports that there are some orthodox Jews who will watch fireworks tonight with no sound. Seeing as this year the 4th of July is during the 3 Weeks between Shiva Asar B&#8217;Tamuz and Tisha B&#8217;Av there are some elements of mourning that are customary during this period. Many orthodox Jews refrain from listening to music as part of their mourning these 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Fireworks are often accompanied by music. Journalist Menachem Wecker was curious if the music accompaniment would cause some orthodox Jews to forgo the usual fireworks celebrations.</p>
<p>There are probably very few orthodox Jews who care about July 4th who also would be so stringent about the 3 weeks that they would not even listen to background music. Of those who are that stringent, very few would care to participate in July 4th festivities.<span id="more-7318"></span></p>
<p>Are there any orthodox Jews who will avoid places that have music in the background? What do they do if they get put on hold? Radio advertisement jingles? Cell phone ring tones? Singing toddler toys? That <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQT9K_nkeVQ" target="_blank">awesome music that plays when you start Windows 2000</a>? Obviously these questions are absurd. The real prohibition is against live music and celebration. Most orthodox Jews extend that to recored music as well. But I don&#8217;t think there are many people who avoid music at all costs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I told Menachem Wecker when he talked with me about this issue and then I was quoted in his article.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the headline though. It kind of says the opposite of what the article says.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, if a July 4th celebration would interfere with one&#8217;s observance of the appropriate level of mourning at this time of year, I think one should make their own decision to refrain from celebrating. I don&#8217;t that would apply to many people, but out first allegiance is to Torah, then and only then do we pledge allegiance to the flag.</p>
<p>Enjoy the holiday. Happy birthday America!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/reasonrallysca_reasonrally.png"><img class=" wp-image-5332 alignleft" title="reasonrallysca_reasonrally" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/reasonrallysca_reasonrally-300x243.png" alt="" width="240" height="194" /></a>At the Reason Rally last weekend Richard Dawkins plead with those in attendance to rid our world of religion. But it wasn&#8217;t enough to preach to the choir (hehe) and reaffirm their atheist beliefs. Dawkins urged the 20,000 in attendance to ridicule religion and show contempt for religion.</p>
<p>This is further than previous calls to action by atheists. It used to be enough to challenge believers to debate, publish books and articles, but now Dawkins wants atheists to verbally attack religious people. Let me get right out and say it, this is really really bad idea.<span id="more-5330"></span></p>
<p>Now, I do sympathize with many of the ideas that Dawkins teaches. I think that politics and government policy should not be decided by religious beliefs. This is not because I think religious beliefs are inherently bad or wrong, in fact, I am in favor of many religious beliefs. I am a religious person myself. I think religion can and should play a strong an important role in our lives. But I don&#8217;t think it is fair or correct for one particular religion to rule our thinking and public policy. Every religion has mutually exclusive beliefs and all religious beliefs are exclusive of atheist beliefs. Our government should not favor one over the other. On this, Dawkins and I somewhat agree.</p>
<p>But now Dawkins is pushing harder. He is no longer simply concerned with eliminating religious beliefs from government, he wants to eliminate religion. Period. Not only does he want to eliminate religion but he wants atheists to be confrontational and to mock religious people.</p>
<p>There are a few problems with this proposal.</p>
<p>First of all, in my experience very little comes from confrontation. Most people reinforce their beliefs when confronted or ridiculed.</p>
<p>Second of all, if the platform of atheist is reason and rationality then mocking others hardly reinforces that notion. Stick to your principles, don&#8217;t resort to bully tactics.</p>
<p>Third of all (and most importantly), there is nothing wrong with people holding religious beliefs! People are free to believe as they choose. Several studies and talks discuss the importance of religion in people&#8217;s lives even if it would be shown to be false! The issue is not whether people should believe in God or hold religious beliefs. The issue is whether those beliefs should play a prominent role in a melting-pot society. There are excellent arguments to be made on both sides of that issue. Ridicule is not an argument.</p>
<p>Frankly, I am disappointed by this development. Hopefully, atheists and believers can come together to create the best possible society for everyone; a world free of mockery and ridicule.</p>
