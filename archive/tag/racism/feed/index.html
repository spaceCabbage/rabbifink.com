				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>I don&#8217;t know when or exactly how or why, but at some point in my childhood I became enamored with Martin Luther King Jr. and the speech he gave 50 years ago today. I remember that one of the first things I did on the Internet was listen to the speech. I will never forget the euphoric feeling I experienced when I heard Dr. King say <em>&#8220;&#8230;when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God&#8217;s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, &#8220;Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!&#8221;<span id="more-7585"></span></em></p>
<p>The speech influenced me greatly and I had a <a href="http://www.archives.gov/press/exhibits/dream-speech.pdf" target="_blank">faux archive version copy of the speech</a> in my childhood desk drawer.</p>
<p>Ever since then I have shared the same dream as Dr. King.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7586" alt="GTY_MLK_march_on_washington_1963_lpl_130801_16x9_608" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/GTY_MLK_march_on_washington_1963_lpl_130801_16x9_608-600x337.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Content of their character. We are getting there. It&#8217;s very hard to avoid our natural biases. It&#8217;s a lifetime effort. It&#8217;s something everyone needs to work on and Dr. King calls upon us to do just that.</p>
<p>Similarly, I urge all of us to judge ideas by the content and substance of the idea and not the value we place in the person making the statement.</p>
<p>But I have a dream that in the Jewish community we can judge one another by the content of our character and not by our affiliations and style of clothing. My dream is that we can create a global Jewish community united by far more than the things that separate us.</p>
<p>One day, all Jews, no matter their belief in God, Torah M&#8217;Sinai, or the Afterlife will work together to provide positive Jewish experiences for our communities. One day, whether we are Zionist or indifferent, liberal or conservative,  we can form a united Jewish nation. One day, mystics and rationalists, GRAniks and chasidim will dance together. One day it won&#8217;t matter who one&#8217;s grandparents were or which town one&#8217;s family came from in Europe or &#8220;God forbid,&#8221; if they came from one of the Arab countries.</p>
<p>Dr. King&#8217;s dream resonates with all of us. It gives us hope for a better future. A future where pettiness and narcissism give way to tolerance and empathy. That is my dream.</p>
<p>How do we get there? We fight against drawing imaginary lines that only serve to divide us. We argue for the rights of those who are under-represented within our ranks. We strive to give our children every opportunity to succeed and find meaningful, joyous, passionate Judaism that is inclusive, understanding, and loving. We reach out to our ideological opponents and offer them friendship with no strings attached. We explore innovative and comprehensive solutions to our social problems instead of applying bandaids to severed limbs.</p>
<p>Yes, it is a dream. But it&#8217;s a dream I believe in strongly. It is a dream worth fighting for. It is a dream that Dr. King inspired in a little boy who grew up to be me.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, the speech echoes through my brain. It&#8217;s message cuts through the noise and sings a beautiful song of hope. Thank you Dr. King for inspiring generations of people and thank you for inspiring me with the greatest speech I have ever had the privilege to hear. On its 50th anniversary we say thank you.</p>
<p>I hope we will live to see your dream come true and all of our dreams as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em>Cross-posted at <a href="https://medium.com/p/384410654ced" target="_blank">Medium</a></em></p>
<p>In the old days, when it was still cool to be a racist, people felt superior to other people because of the color of their skin. A white person was automatically better, smarter, more worthy than a non-white person and the average white person thought this was acceptable. This resulted in slavery, segregation, vigilante justice, and the dehumanization of black people.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have progressed as a society to the point where that kind of thinking is abhorrent and is considered wrong. That’s the good news.</p>
<p>However, we have also spawned a new form of racism. This is a much more subtle racism but equally nefarious.<span id="more-7398"></span></p>
<p>In the wake of the George Zimmerman trial we have seen strong reactions from some members of the black community decrying the lack of justice for Trayvon Martin. There is an equally strong counter-reaction explaining that it’s okay to suspect black people of crimes because the statistics support suspicion. This latter group are the modern racists.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7399" alt="6122894190_64c17ede01_b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/6122894190_64c17ede01_b-600x488.jpg" />The statistics show that black people commit a higher proportion of crimes than white people. Leaving aside the difficulties presented by the bias of selective enforcement and selective prosecution, I argue that using these statistics at all is an example of modern racism.A statistic is only meaningful if the data being used is a factor in the conclusion. For example, (and this is completely fictional) if I were to show that the majority of red haired women possesed below average intelligence, that statistic would not be meaningful unless I showed a causation between hair color and inferior intelligence. If I can’t show that, the statistic is meaningless. Even if the statistic is “true” it still doesn’t tell me anything about other red haired women. It just means that red haired people are not a significant group with enough specific traits to be classsified as a group with particular characteristics and predictable tendencies.</p>
<p>Categorizing all black people as one large group where the acts of one black person in Florida somehow tell us something about a different black person in Seattle is racist. Even within the same community it can be offensive to group people together because they share a skin tone. If the only thing two people share is skin tone then we cannot make any meaningful inferences from one person’s behavior to the other person’s behavior.</p>
<p>If we make judgments for the entire arbitrarily created group, we are being racists. There is no reason that the act of a black man in Texas should mean more about the potential acts of a black man in Michigan than his acts should inform us about a a white Norwegian woman or an indigenous Korean man. The only reason to connect the imaginary dots between all people of color is because there is a fallacious assumption that all people of color share some attribute that makes what one black person does meaningful in the analysis of what another will do. This is racist.</p>
<p>It’s not racist in the old fashioned lynch mob way. But it is still racist to presume one knows things about one black person simply because another black person or group of black people act a certain way.</p>
<p>I find that this is a very difficult concept for some people. These people clearly think that there actually is a black predisposition toward illegal or dangerous activity.</p>
<p>We must not tolerate that kind of thinking in 2013.</p>
<p>I’m looking at you <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/black-americas-real-problem-isnt-white-racism-070000529.html" target="_blank">Pat Buchanan</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hate-crimes-stop-hating.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7000" alt="hate-crimes-stop-hating" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hate-crimes-stop-hating-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>Why do we focus so much on anti-Semitism? A recent article on Aish.com makes a decent point that the State of Israel did not solve anti-Semitism. Herzl hoped it would end Jew hatred. Clearly it did not.</p>
<p>But for some reason the writer, Rabbi Blech, emphasizes that hatred of Jews is unreasonable and defies logic. Well obviously. Hating anyone for no reason is by definition nonsensical. The odd implication seems to be that hatred of others makes sense and hatred of Jews does not.</p>
<p>I disagree. There is irrational hatred all over the world. Is it rational to hate people because of the color of skin? Is it rational to hate any of the persecuted minorities and ethnic groups? Of course not.</p>
<p>Yet around the world and over the course of history people have been persecuted and hated for being just slightly different. Whether they are different looking, different speaking, different thinking, different anything. There are plenty of excused people give to hate. None of them make a bit of sense. Hate is universal. Us Jewish people have not cornered the market on being hated.<span id="more-6999"></span></p>
<p>I think what makes anti-Semitism unique is that Jews have lived all over the world and been a minority in so many places that we have managed to have more people in more places hate us for no reason than anyone else. Other hated people are more localized. Seems to me, that is a more logical explanation than to create a qualitative distinction between hating Jews and hating everyone else.</p>
<p>Rabbi Blech says the true answer to anti-Semitism is that &#8220;we persist in fulfilling our mission to serve as the world’s conscience until all of mankind learns to acknowledge the beautiful truths of our heritage.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think this is a complete answer. Hatred of Jews defies logic. Being the world&#8217;s conscience won&#8217;t fix stupid.</p>
<p>The more complete antidote to anti-Semitism and all hate is to preach love and tolerance, to find common ground with others, to create opportunities for people to learn more about one another and realize on their own that there is nothing rational about hating people for the simple fact that they are different.</p>
<p>There is no rule that states that people must hate one another in order for the world to spin on its axis. It can end and it will end. But let&#8217;s not limit ourselves to working on Jew hatred. All hate is the same and all hate can be fixed pretty easily.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6761" alt="Westboro Baptist Church members protest at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/westboro-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" />We&#8217;ve all heard of the Westboro Baptist Church. They are the guys who protest at the funerals of U.S. soldiers blaming their deaths on gays in the military. They also hate Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Lady Gaga, obviously President Obama, and they love using the word fag.</p>
<p>But the church is not really a church and their worldview is not limited to making public protests. The church is more like a family. Almost everyone is related to the head of the church, Fred Phelps. Their theology is a very chaste brand of Baptist style Christianity and is consistently conservative. Check out this great documentary on the WBC: <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xtfgxo_the-most-hated-family-in-america_shortfilms" target="_blank">The Most Hated Family in America</a>. <em>(Another previous documentary filmmaker wound up joining the church!)</em></p>
<p>Megan Phelps-Roper was considered the future of the church. A few weeks ago she left the church and won&#8217;t be going back. I learned that one of the keys to her successfully leaving the church was David Abitbol, otherwise known at @Jewlicious on Twitter. Abitbol used theological arguments to diffuse much of what Megan had been taught. She didn&#8217;t leave right away. She kept trying to revive her faith and believe as she always had. But she simply could not. So she left.</p>
<p>As an aside, how cool is that? Amazing work by Abitbol. He was outraged by the WBC so he did something about it. Very impressive.<span id="more-6760"></span> The rest of us were just outraged. The best I could muster was a 25 page paper trying to figure out a way they could be sued without protection from the 1st Amendment.</p>
<p>I found Megan on Facebook and requested to be her friend. She accepted and I thanked her for accepting the request and in the process called her a hero.</p>
<p>To me, she is a hero because she is &#8220;one who shows great courage&#8221; and also because she is &#8220;an object of extreme admiration.&#8221; Obviously it takes great courage to leave one&#8217;s family and entire life behind. But what about Megan is worthy of &#8220;extreme admiration?&#8221;</p>
<p>More to the point, should, as a religious orthodox Jew, be admiring someone who has forsaken their religion? Is there something hypocritical about admiring her for leaving her group and me sticking to mine?</p>
<p>I have two responses.</p>
<p>First, there is no comparison between the beliefs of the WBC and orthodox Judaism. The WBC puts the focus of their religion on hate. While orthodox Judaism does have some abhorrent beliefs, these are not core beliefs, nor are they central to observance today. If a person didn&#8217;t believe in the abhorrent parts of Judaism, no one would even know. Whereas in the WBC, those beliefs are the cornerstone of their religious observance. You can&#8217;t possibly avoid it.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think everyone should challenge their beliefs. It&#8217;s not easy to challenge one&#8217;s own beliefs and subject one&#8217;s views to scrutiny. Many of our great rabbis prohibited us from doing that. They felt it is too dangerous. We are strongly urged not to read books that are contradictory to our faith. They might be dangerous. But it&#8217;s also dangerous not to analyze one&#8217;s beliefs at all. It&#8217;s also dangerous if one expects every answer to be perfect. There are not always good answers. We need to be able to be comfortable without all the answers. But as our great rabbis taught us, we must know what to answer. Sometimes, the answer is &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Other times, the answer is &#8220;A is better than B, but A is not perfect.&#8221; Clearly, we are supposed to subjugate our beliefs to some testing so that we will have some answers.</p>
<p>Questions without any answers led Megan away from the WBC but Megan has not left religion. She simply left a hateful, hurtful, twisted brand of religion.</p>
<p>Megan challenged her beliefs and her beliefs failed to stand up to the most basic of questions. Walking away from one&#8217;s entire family because one is fairly certain their beliefs are false and harmful takes great bravery. It is admirable to do what one feels is right against the odds. If I was as convinced that what I was doing is wrong as Megan was convinced about her beliefs, I would hope to have as much courage as Megan. So yes, what she did was admirable. Challenging conventional wisdom and changing one&#8217;s beliefs is admirable. Doing it and acting on it is heroic.</p>
<p>The world would be a far greater place if more of us challenged conventional wisdom.</p>
<p>I hope we will hear more from Megan in the future. Hers is an important voice in the religious discourse of the 21st century.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6755" alt="Hands on a globe" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/HandsEarth-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" />While I was away, two prominent public figures in the orthodox Jewish world embarrassed themselves.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Manis Friedman compared getting raped to having diarrhea among other vomit inducing statements on abuse and Dov Hikind dressed up in blackface for Purim. We need not reconsider the incredible stupidity of both of these decisions. R&#8217; Friedman fake apologized and then halfheartedly apologized later. Hikind didn&#8217;t apologize and then sort of apologized later.</p>
<p>But what happened? Why did they make such incredible faux pas?</p>
<p>Orthodox Jews live in insular communities. I think that a symptom of insularity is tunnel-vision. We see things the way that our small group of similarly minded people see something. We are infrequently exposed to alternative views when our peers and community reflect very similar values and ideas to our own.<span id="more-6754"></span></p>
<p>Almost every orthodox Jew must deal with this at some point. Our schools, shuls, neighborhoods, little leagues, shops and stores, restaurants, and social gatherings are almost exclusively with people who are just like us. We even have our own media (along with secular media bans to boot!). Diversity is rare and not especially valued. This is not necessarily a bad thing. But there are going to be some side effects.</p>
<p>One side effect is that we may be completely unaware of how the rest of the civilized world feels about certain things.</p>
<p>Growing up, there was a racial slur that I heard very often. I guess in the back of my mind I knew it was not appropriate, but it was part of the vernacular of the social environment I was part of. One Shabbos evening, when I was a campus rabbi at USC, I had some students over and we were talking outside as they were about to leave. A name came up and I said something like &#8220;I thought they were [racial slur - (not the N word)]. The second I said it, I regretted it. I realized immediately that it was totally inappropriate. The reaction of my politically correct college student guests was enough to send me digging a grave beneath my feet. I apologized right away, but I should not have said it in the first place.</p>
<p>I am not excusing my behavior. However, it was new for me to be outside the comfort zone of my insular community. No one would have looked twice if I had said that word among our community. But now I was on the outside. It was trial by fire. Saying that word in the real world is wrong and everyone knows it.</p>
<p>Attending Law School was an amazing experience for me. I got to meet and talk with people from all sorts of backgrounds and with all kinds of different ideas. For the first time, I was engaging people with backgrounds that were different than my own as a peer. It changes you. It makes you a better person. For better or worse, most orthodox Jews don&#8217;t get that experience.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that neither R&#8217; Manis or Dov Hikind meant to be offensive or racist. They just had no idea how their ideas would sound or look to people on the outside. That&#8217;s a symptom of being surrounded by people who don&#8217;t interact with people on the outside.</p>
<p>If before he answered that question, I told R&#8217; Friedman that sex abuse can be deadly, it can drive people to suicide, it can destroy one&#8217;s life, and he believed me, and he understood what I was saying, he would never have said what he said. But I presume that no one ever told him that. That&#8217;s becuase no one has been telling orthodox Jews the truth about sex abuse until very recently and very timidly at that. It&#8217;s getting better, but the degree of misinformation highly outweighs the appreciation of the truth about abuse in our communities. So it&#8217;s no surprise that R&#8217; Friedman made comments that nearly caused me to lose my lunch and had me so upset for a few days. He didn&#8217;t know better. And how would he considering our insularity?</p>
<p>If before Purim, I told Dov Hikind that blackface was considered inappropriate in the 60&#8242;s and asked a few black people to explain why it bothers them so much, I am sure he would never would have dreamed of wearing blackface to a Purim party (and then saying &#8220;I would do it again&#8221;). I am pretty sure he had no idea and still doesn&#8217;t really get it. Whose fault is that? Partially his for not breaking out of his insular bubble, but in the end he is just a victim of his society that doesn&#8217;t really get it when it comes to minorities in general and black people in particular. In a community where no one bats an eyelash at racial slurs like the N word or the Yiddish slightly less offensive version, how in the world are we to expect any sensitivity toward racially inappropriate behavior?</p>
<p>Now I am not excusing R&#8217; Friedman or Hikind for their deplorable actions. Ignorance is not bliss. I am saying that we as a community need to be more aware of what the rest of the world thinks. We need to realize that we are part of a global community now and we are going to be noticed. There is outside information that can help us and we should attempt to assimilate that information into our social structure. It&#8217;s not more frum to think that the Torah can cure sex abuse and it&#8217;s not more frum to say or do things that could be considered racist. It&#8217;s time to move on and learn from our advanced understanding of psychology and our politically sensitive society.</p>
<p>The same goes for how women are thought of and treated in the frum community. We are way behind the rest of the world in our approach to women. Is it really frum or necessary to keep those ancient notions that are rooted in social conventions and commonly held beliefs? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>We must hold tightly to what the Torah says and what Chazal require from us, but we must also integrate new knowledge and understanding that increases our sensitivity to others and our place in an international, cosmopolitan community. In this way, we can combine the best of what Torah offers with the best of what a global, sensitive society can offer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/antisemitism.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6503" title="antisemitism" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/antisemitism-245x300.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="300" /></a>At times like these, when Israel engages in a military operation and the world watches, two things are guaranteed: There will be biased or unfair reporting against Israel and there will be claims of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Anti-Semitism is an interesting thing. There certainly is precedent for Jew Hating and Jew Killing. Historically, this was an ideological position that was espoused by dominant religion against Jews. Whether it was Christians or Muslims, Jew hating was part of their religious beliefs. As the Western World became less fervently religious anti-Semitism spilled over into the secular world as well.</p>
<p>Along with anti-Semitism, dominant groups have long hated the &#8220;other&#8221;. Sometimes dominant groups hated each other. There are minorities in the United States of America, Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, that suffer discrimination on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t argue whether there is something &#8220;different&#8221; about anti-Semitism or not in this post. I am not convinced that hating Jews is catergorically different than hating any other &#8220;different group&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rabbi Slifkin, who I love and with whom I have the pleasure of a personal friendship, argues in his recent post that anti-Semitism can be used as a source of inspiration to believe in God.<span id="more-6502"></span></p>
<p>Here is the punchline:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many readers are struggling with the fundamentals of faith. Is it rational to believe that there is something special about the Jews? That we are the chosen people? Aren&#8217;t we just yet another nation with delusions of grandeur?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I think that one can also draw faith, albeit in an odd way, from the blood libel, especially in its contemporary incarnation. In the entire global history of armed conflict, no nation has done remotely as much as Israel to minimize civilian (and even military) casualties amongst its enemies. Yet simultaneously, no nation receives remotely as much condemnation for killing civilians!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Is this normal?! Does this reflect a world in which there is nothing other than the order of nature?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Like I said, it&#8217;s somewhat odd to draw faith from something negative. But I find it to be an enormously powerful example of how there is something unique about the Jewish People. Overwhelming, bizarrely irrational global hatred; and yet we have survived, and returned to our homeland. Am Yisrael Chai!</em></p>
<p>I agree with Rabbi Slifkin that we should definitely try to draw faith from wherever we can draw it. I&#8217;ve written the same thing in a different context.</p>
<p>However, I was curious if Rabbi Slifkin actually meant that anti-Semitism is due to some supernatural cause or if it was simply irrational for people to hate Jews. His answer? The former. In other words, according to Rabbi Slifkin, the world&#8217;s irrational hatred for us is Divinely ordained. (I think that is what he was saying. I am not trying to put words in his mouth.)</p>
<p>While I said above that I won&#8217;t argue whether the phenomena of anti-Semitism is unique, I also will not argue that it is not irrational. But I will argue that just because it might be unique and irrational it does not imply that God is causing anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>The view of Maimonides (and some would argue Nachmanides) regarding God&#8217;s interaction with the world is that it is limited. It mostly manifests itself through Nature, as created by God. Miracles occur from time to time and bend or break the rules of nature. Not everyone agrees with this view of God&#8217;s interaction with the world. Certainly there are much more expansive views and in fact those views have taken hold in orthodox Judaism as mainstream opinions.</p>
<p>Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s website is called Rationalist Judaism. While there is no such thing as pure Rationalism when it comes to Judaism, there are some basic principles to Rationalist Judaism. One of those principles, I believe, is &#8220;minimalism&#8221;. That is, when there is no need to rely on a supernatural phenomena or a fantastical interpretation, Rationalist Judaism does not do so. If we say that anti-Semitism is supernatural, I think we are saying that God interferes with nature and puts the anti-Semitism into the world. I think that is what it means when we say that anti-Semitism is Divine.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument let us presume that anti-Semitism is unique and irrational. I don&#8217;t believe that it implies Divinity. Hatred of other groups is also unique (maybe) and definitely irrational. Would we make the same claim and say that those minorities are persecuted by some Divine measure? I don&#8217;t think Rationalist Judaism would. Which leaves me to wonder, why would we do so when it comes to hatred or dehumanization of us Jews?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we are forced to say that anti-Semitism implies a supernatural cause. Unless one already believes <em>everything</em> is caused supernaturally (a fine, traditional position) I don&#8217;t see why anti-Semitism should be different.</p>
<p><em>Lest you invoke &#8220;Halacha Yadua Eisav Soneh l&#8217;Yaakov&#8221; see this excellent article by Rabbi Adlerstein: <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2006/09/05/is-antisemitism-universal/" target="_blank">Is Anti-Semitism Universal?</a></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/M21554875.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6400" title="M21554875" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/M21554875-300x181.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="181" /></a>The NBA season kicked off last night. The league is 83% non-white player. That makes for an average of 2.55 white players per NBA team (15 player rosters).</p>
<p>So it is definitely notable when a team has more than 3 white players and it is extremely unusual for a team to have 10 white players out of its 15 total players. It might be unusual, but that is this year&#8217;s Minnesota Timberwolves. They are the whitest team in NBA recent memory.</p>
<p>This has created some problems for the team.</p>
<p>A civil rights leader has accused the team of signing white players to appeal to the dominantly white Minneapolis &#8211; St. Paul community. He thinks it is a ploy to get white fans to buy more tickets to see the games.<span id="more-6399"></span></p>
<p>The team owner vehemently denies any such intent.</p>
<p>Not to mention that this tactic makes no sense. To make that assertion, one must assume that the white players are inferior and were chosen not for talent, but were chosen for their skin color despite their lack of talent. To assume that people are so racist that they will buy tickets to watch white players who are inferior to black players is quite an accusation. It means that not only are they racists, but they are idiots. It&#8217;s 2012. Americans want their teams to win more than they want them to look like they do. I&#8217;m very unimpressed with this civil rights activist&#8217;s claim.</p>
<p>The only real problem the team has experienced with so many white players is the choice of music in the locker room according to their lone black starting player, Brandon Roy.</p>
<p>But the latent issues that this accusation raises are worth addressing.</p>
<p>First of all, there are words used by fans and the media to describe players that vary depending on the player&#8217;s ethnicity. Black players are called athletic. White players are called smart. This is not meant to be insulting or racial. It just happens.</p>
<p>Second of all, the question of whether there is a subtle racism when assuming that white players are inferior to black players. While it may be true that more black players are better at basketball than white players, it seems to me that making assumptions based on race or color could be seen as insensitive. On the other hand, is playing probabilities and making snap judgments based on well established norms, racism?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a two way street. If another person feels like a comment being made towards them is racist, I don&#8217;t think the intent really matters. There is certainly merit and value to avoiding words and phrases that others find offensive. This applies whether it is reasonable or not for that person to be offended.</p>
<p>Then again, the street does go the other direction as well. It would be wonderful if we were all a little less sensitive. While it is understandable that some people are very touchy, especially when it comes to race, it would be wise for us all to raise our standard of what offends us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/3454935091_Explaination_xlarge.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5750" title="3454935091_Explaination_xlarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/3454935091_Explaination_xlarge-300x236.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="236" /></a>Children are fascinating creatures. All adults started out as children, yet we seem to have no real recollection of what it was like to be a child. Can we really recall what it was like to try things for the first time? Do we remember what it was like to dream of being old enough to make our own decisions? Or to be excluded from conversations because we were not old enough?</p>
<p>I think that intellectually we have those memories in our collective psyche but we can&#8217;t really relate to children.</p>
<p>One of the more difficult roles that adults need to play in the lives of children is &#8220;Answerer of Questions&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are many types of questions and many approaches to answering their questions. Some questions relate to religion, others to society, others are just questions that we cannot answer because we simply don&#8217;t know the answer.</p>
<p>An article in this week&#8217;s NY Times Magazine addresses the concerns of one father as he and his son encounter stereotypes in books and movies. In just 60 years, we as a society have severely adjusted what we consider proper and appropriate depictions of minorities. Yet, some stereotypes persist and are still debated in 2012.<span id="more-5749"></span></p>
<p>The article begins with the child asking why some pirates have a gorilla. The &#8220;gorilla&#8221; is not a gorilla. It is just a very ugly stereotype of an African male.</p>
<p>What do you answer your children when they ask about these ugly stereotypes? Read the article to see what that guy does.</p>
<p>But the article got me thinking about a few things as they relate to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>For starters, I think it is good for us to know that all kids have questions and many parents are placed in the uncomfortable position of answering them. It&#8217;s not just us.</p>
<p>Next, the obvious correlation to orthodox Judaism. In general, we teach our children a very midrashic form of Judaism. We also neglect to mention that there are other interpretations that are valid even within orthodox Judaism. So when our children ask questions and they challenge the wisdom they are being taught, we have ourselves a similar quandary. There are several options. We can defer until they get older. We can change the subject. We can answer the way we would answer an adult. We can reinforce the more fundamentalist view. We have to make the best choice for ourselves and our family.</p>
<p>But the most difficult issues arise when modern sensibilities feel betrayed by commandments in the Torah. I don&#8217;t need to be specific. But there are many instances where a child&#8217;s innocence can cause them to question the Divine Wisdom of God. What are we to say then? How do we explain to our children that God&#8217;s Book has different ideas about what is fair and just than we do?</p>
<p>There are really only three options. 1) We are wrong. God is right. Our minds are perverted by society and when our mind conflicts with God&#8217;s word, we must be wrong. Adjust your thinking accordingly. 2)We are right. God is wrong. Our society is smarter than the Author of this book that claims to be Divine. Toss the Book. 3) The word of God was just at one time. Society has changed and God&#8217;s will can change based on society&#8217;s adjustments.</p>
<p>Option 1 is easy. Fundamentalist Jews use this all the time and with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Option 2 is also easy. It not an acceptable approach in orthodox Judaism. Not one tiny bit.</p>
<p>Option 3 is complicated. Certainly, this is one part of the overall approach of the Reform and Conservative movements. This is not a sufficient reason for it to be wrong in the eyes of orthodox Jews, but it is a warning sign to many. The real question is not who subscribes to this belief, rather, is this belief an acceptable belief in certain circumstances?</p>
<p>Now I am not enough of an expert, by any means, to completely answer this question. However, I do have some preliminary thoughts. First of all, isn&#8217;t this the message of Avraham&#8217;s prayer for the Sedomites? I think it may be.</p>
<p>Further, some parts of Biblical Judaism have already been abrogated, either by the fact that we don&#8217;t have a Temple, or a Sanhedrin, or a Biblical Court. Other parts have been abrogated by the fact that we are not in a position to carry out the word of God. So what do we make of these? Are we to say that God&#8217;s will is that we should really be following these laws but we are <em>anusim</em> in these matters? Or do we say that this is fate? God&#8217;s will is that we should adapt over time and these laws should not be followed in 2012.</p>
<p>There are also cultural and social aspects of contemporary orthodox Judaism that may seem to be part of Judaism but are really just non-essential parts of our lives. Certainly, there are some things that fall into this category that may even be a mitzvah to reject. I will leave this category as a very general comment.</p>
<p>And then there are areas of Jewish law and thought that have not been touched or adjusted at all over time. Or have only been marginally adjusted. Admittedly, I don&#8217;t think any of those are explicitly found in the written Torah. But the Oral Law has generally been treated with the same reverence and reluctance for change. So returning to the original question, is Option 3 acceptable for orthodox Jews?</p>
<p>In some ways yes in other ways no. Is there a pattern or any rhyme or reason to when the answer is yes and when the answer is no? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Most importantly, these questions are not just questions that our children ask, they are questions that we as adults ask. We can&#8217;t be afraid of the questions. We need to be confident in our answers or in our lack of answers. But either way, taking Option 1 or Option 2 ends the conversation. We don&#8217;t want to end the conversation. We want to continue the conversation that&#8217;s been taking place for 3000 years and will take place until the end of days.</p>

Apparently, there is some opposition that is non-sensical, bigoted and pathetically transparent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad to see that the primary opposition to the eruv is from a yiddish speaking Jew. It&#8217;s also sad to see him so thoroughly embarrassed in the clip. I actually feel bad for the guy as much of a jerk he seems in the clip&#8230;</p>
<p>At the Pacific Jewish Center, we have faced similar opposition to our proposed eruv. And by similar I mean, coming from Jews and equally self contradictory. It is our hope that we will pick up the eruv project for Santa Monica, Venice and Marina del Rey in the near future.</p>
<p>I hope Westhampton gets their eruv and I hope we get ours soon as well. Some commentary below the clip.<span id="more-3961"></span></p>

<p>First of all, an eruv is technically not a loophole. I explained in brief here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/11/the-good-wife-unorthodox-from-a-rabbi-law-student-perspective/">The Good Wife: Unorthodox, From a Rabbi / Law Student Perspective</a> that an eruv is not a loophole. Here is what it is (and this is good for people who actually don&#8217;t know and people who need to explain to people who don&#8217;t know):</p>
<p>The prohibition against carrying on Shabbos is from a private domain to a public domain or a second private domain. One IS permitted to carry within their own home. One is permitted to carry within their own enclosed property (eg: a yard surrounded by a fence). One is permitted to carry from inside their home to their enclosed outdoor property as well. The function of the eruv (which unlike the not so funny joke during the clip does not mean loophole, it means mixture) is to mix / connect many domains into one LARGE private domain. All that is required is a SYMBOLIC enclosure that is halachically considered a wall. A wire running from two poles is sufficient to create a symbolic halachic wall.</p>
<p>Thus, when a wire surrounds a large area that has been designated as a single private domain, joining all the private domains therein into ONE domain, obviously carrying is permitted within that one domain. There are some requirements that need to be met for the large domain to include the private domains. If those requirements are met and there is a unification of many domains via a symbolic, halachic wall, one may carry within that domain exactly as they can carry from room to room within one&#8217;s own home.</p>
<p>Second of all, like I said, it is sad to see Jews pitted against each other. Though, I can&#8217;t assign all blame to the fellow who is against having Orthodox Jewish neighbors. Sometimes Orthodox Jews don&#8217;t make the best neighbors. I don&#8217;t mean this is in an entirely negative way. It&#8217;s normal for Orthodox Jews not to be completely neighborly with their less religious neighbors. They have different standards and different priorities. It can get messy. All I mean to say is that we should be conscious of the opinions of our neighbors and be even more scrupulous to be the best neighbors possible. If we would do that, I am sure we would be less resistance from others to moving to their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Third of all, we see most clearly how ugly bigotry looks when it affects us personally. It is important to try to avoid these kinds of bigoted remarks and behavior in relation to others. Especially after we see how it feels to be a victim of that bigotry. Please keep that in mind next time you say / hear a blanket, statement that could be construed as racist, bigoted, small minded or hateful.</p>

I don&#8217;t write about every book I read, but this one was worth sharing with you.</p>
<p>The book tells the story a white-Jewish woman Rachel Shilsky / Ruth McBride Jordan, who married two black men and raised a very successful family in the inner city. Alternating chapters, the book tells the story of her childhood from her perspective and the story of her adult life from her son, the author, James McBride&#8217;s perspective. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159448192X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=159448192X">The Color of Water</a> reads like a novel but is biographical.<span id="more-3702"></span></p>
<p>Rachel&#8217;s father was a rabbi in Virginia. According to his daughter, he was a really horrible person. He was violent, unloving and unfaithful to his crippled wife. He was cheap, racist and a hypocrite. Rachel&#8217;s experience with her father was her only Jewish experience and eventually led her to a life as far from Judaism as she could run. Reading about her limited understanding of her Judaism and her father&#8217;s gross behavior was depressing.</p>
<p>But despite it all, she persevered as a person. She left Judaism but she turned herself into a very strong woman. She led a large family against the odds to great success. Perhaps most importantly and ironically, her son attributes their success to her &#8220;Jewishness&#8221;. She pushed her children to get an education and stereotypically, many of them are &#8220;professionals&#8221; that would make any yiddishe mama proud.</p>
<p>As much as Rachel ran away from her Jewish roots, those Jewish values were nevertheless instilled in her family and led them to great success.</p>
<p>The book is fascinating, educational, heartwarming, heartrending and challenging. It is well written, fun to read, leaves room for much discussion, indeed, the book is part of many high school and college curricula and I recommend the book for teens and adults.</p>
<p>I would love to meet Mr. McBride and his mother after reading this book. I am pretty sure you will too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Huckleberry_Finn_book.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3603" title="Huckleberry_Finn_book" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Huckleberry_Finn_book-246x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="273" /></a>By now you&#8217;ve heard the latest victim of political correctness is Huckleberry Finn.</p>
<p>The classic book uses language that was (unfortunately) acceptable in its era but is offensive today. There is no turning back the clock. The N word and the slang term used for Indian are offensive. For this reason, a new edition is being printed that replaces these words with softer terminology. Obviously, this has caused an outrage. Changing the words of an author, especially words that are an integral part of the story, is considered terrible form. The purists scoff at the idea of changing the words of a classic piece of literature.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the book will remain on shelves in its present and original form. This new version is a specific version for those who want it. No one is being forced to purchase this version, nor is there any reason to think it will become especially popular. But it might. And I can understand why purists are upset.</p>
<p>I think the subject is a difficult one.<span id="more-3602"></span></p>
<p>If people are offended by the words in a book, they are offended. There&#8217;s nothing you can do about it. I know that when I read a book that has a negative portrayal of a Jew, I cringe. I don&#8217;t cry. I don&#8217;t write the author to change the words of the book. But it does hurt. My solution? Try to break those stereotypes with my actions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think the N word is similar. The word was used by white folks to assert authority over blacks whom they considered inferior. Any use of the word by the white community hearkens back to that usage. I don&#8217;t there is any way to change that.</p>
<p>So long as the word is hurtful, I don&#8217;t see how those who would be hurt by it can be forced to read it.</p>
<p>What would be best, in my opinion, would be a non-emotional response to a word that is offensive in its context. The FCC allows for some offensive words to be used if they are not in an obscene context. (It&#8217;s called the Bono exception.) The reasoning is that a word is not intrinsically offensive. I think that is reasonable.</p>
<p>I hope the N word can suffer the same fate. It is an offensive when used in an offensive context. But in the story about a boy name Huck Finn it is not objectively offensive.</p>
<p>If folks would stop using the word offensively, it&#8217;s possible the reactions of those who read it will be less inflammatory and the book could retain its original text.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in the opinions of others. Especially those who find the N word in Huck Finn offensive.</p>

They protested Judaism last week in Brooklyn and they have a case in front of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>I have been asked for predictions and my opinion on the issue.</p>
<p>Luckily, I wrote this paper for a Hate Speech Seminar I took at Loyola Law School in the Summer of 2010. There is some important legal background, a quasi-prediction and alternative suggestion for the future in there. (I was given permission to post the article by my professor.)</p>
<p>I hope you will take the time to read it, think it over and share your thoughts with me.</p>
<p>I try to avoid legalese, but if there is something in there that needs explanation please leave a comment so I can explain it to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>Enjoy.<span id="more-3099"></span></p>
<p>(I also recommend watching the excellent documentary on the WBC which follows the paper.)</p>

<p><a href="http://news.uk.msn.com/world/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=154192555">Israel&#8217;s Outrageous Rape Case</a></p>
<p>Over on DovBear (<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/07/israeli-court-shames-itself-with.html">Israeli Court Shames Itself With Idiotic Ruling</a>) there is a fairly predictable post and discussion about the merits of the Israeli court decision.<span id="more-2667"></span> I am certain that the conversation over there is reflective of many similar conversations around the world.</p>
<p>There are two points that I would like to address regarding this case.</p>
<p>First, the issue of consent to sex is highly volatile. On the one hand, it protects women by punishing low-lives who force themselves onto women who may be vulnerable. On the other hand it is very paternalistic. It basically tells women that &#8220;you cannot be trusted with men so the law will take care of you&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is not politically correct to say, but women are more vulnerable than men as a general rule. Men tend to be bigger, stronger and more aggressive. Could a woman beat me up? Yes. Could a woman rape a man? I am sure. But the history of men taking advantage of women tells me that women do need protection by the law.</p>
<p>Second is the inherent racism in the case. And no, I do not mean the court is racist in its ruling.</p>
<p>I mean the &#8220;victim&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the man is Israeli it is okay to sleep with him after just meeting him, but if he is Arab then it is not okay to sleep with him?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that she feels this way. But what is the <em>basis</em> for her feeling this way? If she was very religious then perhaps she is concerned with the Jewish law of &#8220;marrying&#8221; a Jew. But I don&#8217;t think that is what it is.</p>
<p>I think it indicates a strong social aversion to Arabs in Israeli society. So strong that a woman who is willing to sleep with a new acquaintance would not do so if he was Arab.</p>
<p>The court is dealing with the facts on the ground. She would not have consented if she knew he was Arab. That legal issue deserves discussion. What I think is a more productive discussion is why she feels that way.</p>
<p>What factors are okay to consider before sleeping with a man and what factors are not okay? The court seems to think that ethnicity is important enough that her consent was voided. In Israel it is possible that it is that important.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Arabs feel 2nd Class in Israel?</p>
<p>I understand how and why that social reality came to exist.</p>
<p>I also think that perhaps it is more harmful than helpful at this point.</p>

<p>I really like the Museum of Tolerance. The overall message of the museum is a message that I wholeheartedly agree with.</p>
<p>Tolerance is a very important value in my worldview and the museum does a super job teaching that message.</p>
<p>(For a more complete review of the museum read my previous post <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/07/12/my-visit-to-the-museum-of-tolerance-at-the-simon-wiesenthal-center/">My Visit to the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center</a>.)</p>
<p>There was one thing I noticed, or rather, did not notice that I find necessary to question and perhaps even criticize.</p>
<p><span id="more-2623"></span></p>
<p>For all the talk and exhibits representing the horrors of racism, prejudice and segregation there was something missing. I could not help but imagine myself as a (hypothetical) average liberal, civil rights activist visiting the museum.</p>
<p>I am sure I would be impressed with the exhibits and their message. There is a possible segregation issue in one region of the world that is intimately related to the MOT. In fact this area is mentioned in various museum exhibits. Yet nowhere is the important civil rights issue mentioned or explored.</p>
<p>The region is the Middle East and specifically I am referring to Israel.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, there is a level of segregation on Israel. There is a more privileged class and a less privileged class. The Jewish Israelis are the privileged class. They control the policies and laws of the country. The less privileged class are the Arab Muslims in general and in particular the Palestinians living in Gaza.</p>
<p>There is a wall (depicted rather satirically in the photo above) that separates Israelis from Palestinians. There are laws that prevent some services and benefits from Gaza.  In essence there is a level of segregation.</p>
<p>Of course, supporters of Israel explain that these measures are not segregation &#8211; they are protection. They will explain that these policies are justified. That may be true. But on its face, the situation certainly has an appearance of intolerance or racism.</p>
<p>I wish the Museum of Tolerance would have dealt with this issue. It should be presented and rebutted to the best of their ability. If it cannot be rebutted the museum should not be ashamed to admit that. Its omitance seems problematic to me.</p>
<p>The issue is in fact at the forefront of many humanitarian groups. The UN takes it very seriously as well. I would have loved to see a well reasoned, clearly articulated, intelligent response.</p>
<p>Instead I got nothing.</p>
<p>I like the museum a lot. On this issue they can do better. A lot better.</p>

The course was very discussion based with some non-traditional law school reading. We also read the key First Amendment (Free Speech) cases and important Law Review articles on regulating hate speech.</p>
<p>I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Part of the course was a trip to the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.</p>
<p>I took my tour of the museum today. What follows are some general impressions.<span id="more-2617"></span></p>
<p>The museum is impressive. It is modern, hi-tech, welcoming and imformative. I have been to a number of the more prominent Holocaust Museums and exhibits. The Museum of Tolerance takes a unique twist on the Holocaust that I personally found more relevant than some of the other attempts to memorialize the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Perhaps most telling is the non-Holocaust exhibits. There museum has a universal message of tolerance and love that I can really relate to. I saw exhibits on segregation and prejudice. The truth is that even if there was no Holocaust exhibit, these exhibits made the trip worthwhile.</p>
<p>The Holocaust section focuses on the prejudices that existed in 1930&#8242;s Germany. The presentations are slick and grab your attention. The manner in which the information is presented is more like Epcot Center than a High School classroom. They use multimedia in a non-obtrusive way to convery their message.</p>
<p>The homage to shtetl life was sweet but I felt not entirely accurate. The romanticization of Jewish life in pre-war Europe is common and I only expected better from the MOT because they were so good at everything else they did.</p>
<p>As always, I was very drawn to the artifacts and Judaica on display. I absolutely love seeing real, used &#8220;things&#8221; from a time long gone. To see a Torah Scroll that was used hundreds of years ago, with its beautiful hebrew calligraphy and adorned with exquisite silver jewelry is very powerful for me. I also really enjoyed the day to day items on display. The collection includes a Cholent Pot from 19th century Germany. It is earthenware and marked with the words &#8220;Cholent Pot&#8221; and beneath that it has the family name. It looks really nice.</p>
<p>The overall theme of the Holocaust exhibit is that we all have biases. We need to work hard to overcome our prejudices to lead a more tolerant life. I agree whole-heartedly with that message and support the Museum of Tolerance in its work to disseminate that message.</p>
<p>If you are in LA or visiting Los Angles, make a few hour stop at the MOT. It will have an effect on you for a long time.</p>

<p>There is a healthy nostalgia built into Judaism. &#8220;Chadesh yameni k&#8217;kedem&#8221; &#8211; renew our days to the way things were, we say. Of course, like any good thing, too much nostalgia is a bad thing.</p>
<p>After reading the famous case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio">Brandenburg v. Ohio</a> I find myself pining for the anti-Jewish sentiment as expressed in 60&#8242;s as opposed to today.</p>
<div>Brandenburg was a Ku Klux Klan leader in Ohio. At a KKK rally, men dressed in robes and hoods burned a cross and made public declarations of hate.<span id="more-2567"></span> Among their offensive epithets:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bury the niggers&#8221;, &#8220;Freedom for the whites&#8221;, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get them back to the dark garden&#8221;,</p></blockquote>
<p>(see FN1 in the Court opinion for the complete list) all clearly anti-black statements that are highly offensive.</p>
</div>
<div>Of course, no good KKK rally is complete without some anti-Jewish fun as well. These KKK Jew haters proclaimed:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Send the Jews back to Israel&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Today&#8217;s anti-Jewish proclamations are more likely to echo Helen Thomas and say &#8220;Get the Jews out of Israel&#8221;.</div>
<div>Oh how I yearn for the anti-semites of yore. They were so much nicer to us&#8230;</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/book-cover.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2522" title="book-cover" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/book-cover-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="300" /></a>This summer I am taking two classes at Law School that explore many of the issues and themes of racism. I am extremely fascinated by racism, and ethnic hatred. I am still sorting out my feelings on a lot of the issues and I am really happy that I am being exposes to the everything that we are discussing in class.</p>
<p>In Hate Speech Seminar we read a (poorly written, but very interesting) book about the White Supremacy Movement in California through the 80&#8242;s and 90&#8242;s. (It&#8217;s called Skinhead Confessions and you can buy it on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1599551330?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1599551330">Skinhead Confessions: From Hate To Hope</a>. Again, not very well written but very enlightening and an important book.)</p>
<p>The question we have been probing is: Where does racism come from? Why do people hate?<span id="more-2520"></span></p>
<p>Of course, I welcome your suggestions in the comments.</p>
<p>CNN did a series on the famous Doll Test. (I wrote about the Doll Test in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/03/09/simple-justice-the-story-of-brown-v-board-of-education-the-end-of-separate-but-equal-in-schools/">Simple Justice | The Story of Brown v. Board of Education: The End of Separate But Equal in Schools</a>.) Anderson Cooper and a team at CNN performed a similar test to try and learn about how early racism can begin and whether we are effectively teaching our children the important lessons of non-discrimination.</p>
<p>I have included some of the video at the bottom of this post. To read more about their study go to the links at the bottom of the video.</p>
<p>In summary, there is a conclusive and scientific (<a href="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/05/13/expanded_results_methods_cnn.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>) &#8220;White Bias&#8221; among white and black students aged 4-5 years old and less so, but still present in white and black students 9-10 years old. Cooper and his team think this is a result of racist parents and preaching diversity and tolerance but not practicing it at home. This explains why so many children have a white bias.</p>
<p>I have a different theory.</p>
<p>Children, especially young children automatically gravitate to things that look like the things they are accustomed to being around. Young children associate with other children who share their most obvious characteristics. Whether it is height, body size, shirt color, lunchbox or skin color. When young children make choices it is often an indicator of things with which they are comfortable. Of course a white child, with white parents and white siblings is going to prefer things that are white. In fact I am surprised the numbers were not even higher and more in favor of white bias.</p>
<p>The troubling thing is white bias among black children. But this too has a very reasonable explanation. If a black child is a minority and feels like they are different, they will want to join the majority. If the majority is white, then a black child will gravitate to white. It is not racist. It is a white bias. But white bias does not equal racist. A young child with white bias does not portend a future with the skinheads.</p>
<p>I am certain that some of children come from bigoted homes and learned gross stereotypes from their parents. But I am also fairly certain that most of the white children just selected the things that were most familiar to them. Conversely, black children who are a minority want to fit in with the majority and selected the answers that they thought would help them fit in.</p>
<p>CNN, your study is great. But I don&#8217;t buy it.</p>
<p>Further, the guilt they made some of the parents feel over their children&#8217;s selections is plain sensationalist, irresponsible journalism. To take a few isolated questions asked of a 5 year old and show them to parents and then insinuate that the child is racist and the parents must also be racist is cruel, probably incorrect and a ratings grab. (Yes, believe it or not CNN pulled this shtick. You can find it somewhere on their impossible to navigate website.)</p>
<p>Is racism a problem? Yes.</p>
<p>To label 5 innocent 5 year olds racist because of their white bias? Come on, we are better than that.</p>

<p>Gerhart put the Stanford Cardinal football team on his shoulders and carried them to prominence for the first time since John Elway led them to prominence 25 years ago.</p>
<p>His college statistics are astounding: 1871 yards and 27 touchdowns last season. His combine numbers are impressive: 4.50 in the 40 yard dash and a 38 inch vertical leap.</p>
<p>Sounds like a sure-fire first round draft pick&#8230;</p>
<p>So why are scouts projecting Gerhart will be picked in the second round of the upcoming NFL Draft?<span id="more-2405"></span></p>
<p>Gerhart thinks it may be due to the fact that he is white.</p>
<p>In the NFL, running backs are black. And Gerhart is white.</p>
<p>In his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="color: #000000;">“One team I interviewed with asked me about being a white running back,” Gerhart says. “They asked if it made me feel entitled, or like I felt I was a poster child for white running backs. I said, ‘No, I’m just out there playing ball. I don’t think about that.’ I didn’t really know what to say.”</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>In the words of a scout:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“He’ll be a great second-round pickup for somebody, but I guarantee you if he was the exact same guy – but he was black – he’d go in the first round for sure,” the scout said. “You could make a case that he’s a </em><em>Steven Jackson</em><em>-type – doesn’t have blazing speed but he’s strong and powerful and versatile.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Of course there are some legitimate concerns about Gerhart&#8217;s running style and durability and those are factors in his draft placement as well.</p>
<p>Is it racism when a white football player is discriminated against? It can be. When the white person is the minority and the white person is given negative treatment it could be considered racism. And as far as NFL players and specifically NFL running backs go, white is definitely a minority.</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: normal;">I can&#8217;t say whether this case is racism or not. Whether it is perception or reality is impossible to know. But either way I am rooting for Gerharts success. The more stereotypes that can be broken down the better our society will be.</span></span></em></p>

Board of Education: The End of Separate But Equal in Schools</a>. Civil Rights made tremendous strides in the wake of Brown. It was a tumultuous time and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. led the way to racial equality.</p>
<p>Today, we have a president that represents the progress on behalf of all minorities. What was unthinkable a generation ago, is the reality of our world. Imagine a 70 year old black man from the deep south who remembers attending a segregated school and looks in the newspaper in 2010 and sees someone who would have been institutionally discriminated against as the leader of the free world. What a feeling that must be&#8230;</p>
<p>But along with the good, comes some bad. In the last few weeks I have seen some examples of Reverse Discrimination as well as oversensitivity.<span id="more-2245"></span></p>
<p>This article on ESPN.com caught my eye a couple weeks back: <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/commentary/news/story?id=4956425">Winners Hurt by Corporate Bad Judgment</a>. In a Step-Off dance competition an all-white team initially took the crown. But after a mystical &#8220;scoring discrepancy&#8221; was discovered the judges awarded a co-title to a black team as well. Step-Offs are traditionally won by black groups and most of the participants are black teams.</p>
<p>Everyone assumed that the mystical &#8220;scoring discrepancy&#8221; was non-existent and the judges were not exactly forthcoming with details to support their decision. Had this been a reverse situation, where the white team lost in a traditionally white sport or competition, like alpine skiing, and a black athlete won and the judges later awarded a white athlete after finding a mystical &#8220;scoring discrepancy&#8221; the outrage would be powerful, unrelenting and deserved. But it was the reverse and aside from a few sports columnists and bloggers, it went unnoticed. This is not what Brown taught us.</p>
<p>I also saw this news item: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/black-barbie-sold-white-barbie-walmart-store/story?id=10045008" target="_blank">Black Barbie Sold for Less Than White Barbie at Walmart Store</a>. Apparantly, demand for an identical white Barbie was higher than for a black Barbie and the price reflected the lower demand. So on one shelf two identical Barbie&#8217;s were only distinguished by their price and their skin tone. There is nothing inherently wrong with that. But people took offense to it. There are those who said that it was racist and discriminatory.</p>
<p>It must have been real tough for a black consumer to see that, but it was not intended to hurt, nor is it inherently hurtful. I can understand the sensitivity to seeing that, but there is nothing actually wrong with it. Today, there is nearly no institutionalized racism. Racism today exists in the hearts and minds of those who act as racists and equally so, in the hearts and minds of those who perceive racism in what they see.</p>
<p>We have come a long way in 50 years and of course there is a ways to go still. But I believe that the best thing to do would be to stop classifying people along racial lines and shades of skin color. Both of the examples above rely heavily of skin tone and race. The dance competition took action when a non-black team won a traditionally black competition. The outraged shoppers of Walmart saw a lower price for a doll that was a darker skin color and reacted as well. Just as the majority cannot discriminate against the minority, the minority should not be oversensitive to perceive bias in the majority.</p>
<p>It is my true belief that the &#8220;melting pot&#8221; of America will continue to help each and every one of us to judge a person by the content of their character and beliefs and not the color of their skin. It is really a completely illogical, irrational way of thinking to use skin tone as a difference between people. There is nothing innate about skin color that can have any relevance to a discussion about the merits of a human being. Most people realize this by now and  I think we are getting there&#8230;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for some, the effects of decades of discrimination live on. Just watch this ABC News video that employs the same testing done for Brown v. Board of Education with modern day black youth:</p>

I began my talk by complimenting my parents and expressing my desire to emulate their parenting in the raising of my own children. One such example occurred today.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://lls.edu" target="_blank">Law School</a> we are reading some of the most well-known Supreme Court Cases. A few weeks ago we read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade" target="_blank">Roe v. Wade</a> (banning 1st term abortion is unconstitutional) and the even more important <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey" target="_blank">Casey v. Planned Parenthood</a> (upheld Roe) cases. Last week we read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson" target="_blank">Plessy v. Ferguson</a> (after Civil War, Separate but Equal schools were ruled constitutional).</p>
<p>This week we are reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education" target="_blank">Brown v. Board of Education</a>. This case overruled Plessy and made Separate but Equal unconstitutional in <strong><em>Public Schools</em></strong>.<span id="more-2235"></span> Brown v. Board of Education paved the way for Civil Rights activists like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to fight for equal rights for all people in all areas of life, beyond public education.</p>
<p>As I was reading the case I remembered a very influential &#8220;Parenting&#8221; episode from my youth. Growing up, we did not watch many movies. I saw a few movies on TV, like E.T. and The Wizard of Oz but that was about it. But I vividly remember my father strongly encouraging me to watch one particular movie with him when I was twelve years old.</p>
<p>That movie was a PBS special called The American Experience: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108139/fullcredits#cast" target="_blank">Simple Justice</a>. It beautifully told the story of Thurgood Marshall as he learned the law and was groomed into the perfect counsel for the Supreme Court cases to reverse Plessy. The climax of the movie is the Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education and the Court&#8217;s ruling that Separate but Equal was not constitutional.</p>
<p>My father wanted me to see it and I recall a strong desire to study the law and become a lawyer after watching it. My preferred career path took some detours along the way, but several years later my interest in the law returned in earnest.</p>
<p>Today, our professor at Loyola Law School, <a href="http://www.lls.edu/academics/faculty/strauss.html">Marcy Strauss</a>, showed the very same movie to the class in lieu of a more traditional lecture and Socratic discussion. All the memories I had as a youngster were re-energized and I was quite moved by the movie, again.</p>
<p>Brown v. Board of Education raises some very important issues that are still very relevant to modern discourse. In just 56 years, much has changed in the landscape of race relations in the USA. Some things are still the same, or at the very least follow the same bigoted roots. There are other minorities seeking equal rights as well. Sometimes, we can go overboard in our sensitivities as I will write about tomorrow. And sometimes, one part of the world can be slow to see that Separate cannot be Equal, as I will write about the next day.</p>
<p>This movie is a must see. My father was very wise to encourage me to see it and I will always remember watching it together with him. (Thank you.)</p>
<p>The part of the movie that moved me most when I was a youngster stuck with me until today. I was talking with some friends at school and I mentioned that while reading Brown v. Board of Education I recalled a scene from this very movie. I had no idea that we were going to be watching the movie in class. I recounted the scene as best as my 12 year old brain could understand it and it was just as I remembered it when I saw it tonight.</p>
<p>The scene is of a study that was being conducted to analyze the way segregated black children felt about themselves. The tester would ask questions of the children using dolls, one black and one white. The results of the test showed conclusively that black children felt inferior. The dramatization of the test was very powerful and I found it on youtube so that you can see it for yourself below.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;To a better tomorrow&#8221;</em></p>
