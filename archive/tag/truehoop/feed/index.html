<p>A very interesting news item came my way today.</p>
<p>Last Friday night, The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Hoops-Spiritual-Lessons-Hardwood/dp/1401308813/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1263853197&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Zen Master, Phil Jackson</a>, Head Coach of the Los Angeles Lakers Head Coach, was asked about the Los Angeles Clippers. It seems that the Clippers are cursed.</p>
<p>A near perpetual resident of the cellar in the NBA standings, the Clippers have been blessed with plenty of very high draft choices. In the NBA high draft choices are the best way to build a team. The problem for the Clippers has been their draft selections have been huge busts. Some were plagued by injury, some ended up as NBA role players and others were just terrible choices.</p>
<p>Last week the latest Clippers draft pick, selected first overall, Blake Griffin underwent season ending surgery after sitting out the first half of the season hoping to get into playing shape.</p>
<p>So, the media asked Phil Jackson: Do you believe in curses?.</p>
<p>Phil&#8217;s response?</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="more-2043"></span></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/12335/phil-jackson-no-clipper-curse-just-donald-karma" target="_blank">As reported by J. A. Adande on the Truehoop blog:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Jackson said before the Lakers played the Clippers Friday night. &#8220;I&#8217;m of that generation that believes in karma. I do think there is karma in effect, ultimately. But I can&#8217;t proclaim anybody else&#8217;s karma. That&#8217;s their own making. If you do a good mitzvah [a Jewish term for an act of kindness], maybe you can eliminate some of those things. You think Sterling&#8217;s done enough mitzvahs?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another reporter replied that Sterling is a major humanitarian (at least if you believe the ads Sterling has placed in the Los Angeles Times over the years).</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, but how about all those other incidents?&#8221; Jackson said.</p>
<p>Sterling has had his share of lawsuits brought against him, most notably a civil suit that in November resulted in him having to pay a record $2.725 million to settle a suit that claimed he discriminated against African-Americans, Hispanics and families with children in the apartment buildings he owns.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So Phil doesn&#8217;t believe in curses but his does believe in Karma and the power of a mitzvah to change Karma. I think I agree. Doing good in our world creates good energy in our world. The more good energy that is created, the better things may turn out.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it is determinative, but I do think it makes a difference. Whether that is the answer to the Clippers woes I would not claim to know.</p>
<p>But what of Mr. Sterling?</p>
<p>I have two issues with Mr. Sterling.</p>
<p>1) Ads in the LA Times tooting your horn? You need to tell people how much charity you give? It may be a mitzvah to give charity, but it is no mitzvah to publicize it. In fact the highest level of charity is &#8220;matan b&#8217;seyser&#8221;, giving in secret, without anyone knowing. Mr. Sterling, you could do better than to take out expensive ads telling us how great you are. Just be great and we will figure it out on our own.</p>
<p>2) Â On this Martin Luther King Day, I think it is time to call out Mr. Sterling for his discrimination against minorities. Bigots like him, prevent Dr. King&#8217;s dream from becoming a reality. A dream that I share with him. So Mr. Sterling, change your ways or risk the effect of more bad karma&#8230;</p>
<p><em>I know that love is ultimately the only answer to mankind&#8217;s problems. And I&#8217;m going to talk about it everywhere I go.</em> &#8211; Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1225" title="unity" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/unity-300x300.jpg" alt="unity" width="180" height="180" />Rosh Hashana at <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a> was wonderful. The services were inspiring, the attendance was excellent and the mood properly reflected the importance of the days.</p>
<p>I spoke from the pulpit several times over the holiday.</p>
<p>There was certainly an over-arching theme to my sermons. Each had its own individual message but overall they reflected an idea that I feel is central to Rosh Hashana, judgment, repentance, Judaism and Humanity.</p>
<p>It is too easy to get Â caught up in ourselves. We hope for a good verdict, we try to be the best people we can be as individuals.</p>
<p>For me, the greater challenge is fitting in the group. Every time I spoke over the Holiday, the underlying theme was Unity.<span id="more-1224"></span>Each person really has three identities.</p>
<p>One is our own personal accomplishments. Everything that one does in their life goes into this category and those things have value on their own. We look at the person in a vacuum and assess their achievements as an individual. Everyone has unique talents and abilities that make then who they are.</p>
<p>The second identity is the person&#8217;s group. Everyone is part of various groups. Whether by religion, race, political party, trade or family we all belong to groups. Those groups form a part of our identity. But each group member&#8217;s individual role is not relevant. The group has an identity and by association with that group, that identity becomes the identity of everyone in the group.</p>
<p>The third identity is the most important. It is the combination of number 1 and number 2. It is how we interact with the group using our individual talents and abilities. This identity is the meeting point of the indidual and the group. If the individual is selfish and uses their talents and abilities for their own personal gain and ignores the group, the person has failed in this identity. But if the person is able to part if the group and use their individualism to elevate the group, then in turn, they elevate themselves.</p>
<p>No where is this third identity clearer to the observer than in competitive team sports. The individual performer has his or her own talents and abilities. What separates the great ones from the rest, is their ability Â to use those skills and elevate the team.</p>
<p>It is no different in real life. We all have skills and we are all part of groups. We need to use those skills to elevate our groups, not just ourselves.</p>
<p>It was particularly appropriate to find a <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/6975/more-than-a-game-preview" target="_blank">short post on the NBA Truehoop Blog about this issue today</a>.</p>
<p>LeBron James has a new movie. It is supposed to be about teamwork, but as Truehoop so eloquently puts it, the preview completely fails in this regard.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The bummer about it, however, is that the movie is all about teamwork, but the undeniable message of the preview&#8217;s format (James, shooting alone in a gym) is that celebrity trumps all.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Watch the preview below and you will see just what they mean.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="325" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RlEi1iYCukQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="325" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RlEi1iYCukQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Good imagery for the wrong message. We need to be team players in sports and more importantly in life.</p>
