				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article first appeared on <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.675621" target="_blank">Haaretz.com</a>. It is reproduced here with permission.</em></p>
<p>Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are the starting block and finish line of our yearlong journey. The High Holidays offer us time to reflect, repent, and redo. We are seeking a chance to start over, aspiring to a better life.</p>
<p>As we start over in synagogue, tens of thousands of impoverished families across the world are quite literally leaving their homes in desperate search for a better life. Over four million refugees have escaped Syria &#8211; innocent victims of war wandering around the globe on foot, hoping to settle someplace better, someplace new, aspiring to a better life.<span id="more-9423"></span></p>
<p>No one wants these people. Wealthy nations in the Middle East, Europe, and the Americas are doing comically little to absorb refugees and the crisis is only getting worse. Our modern international community may pride itself on ethics and morality, but it’s all talk. The facts betray the empty promises of life and liberty to all. Refugees are being turned away on the threshold of freedom and the doorstep of redemption.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/09/11/why-jews-should-look-to-germany-for-inspiration-this-rosh-hashanah/attachment/1026487215/" rel="attachment wp-att-9424"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9424 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1026487215.jpg?resize=980%2C530" alt="1026487215" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>One country has led the way of light, pledging to absorb 800,000 refugees. Some other countries have followed the lead of this international bastion of moral clarity and kindness. Somehow, Germany has emerged as the beacon of light in this darkness. Every other country comes off terribly. Germany can proudly look herself in the mirror. Germany?! Germany.</p>
<p>For so many Jewish people, the Holocaust has left an indelible mark on our collective soul. All the savage imagery of the Holocaust reopens old wounds. But it can be difficult for us to connect to a historic event. I think this explains the ubiquitous reluctance of American Jews to purchase German products, and a resistance to treating Germany, her land and her people, just like everyone else.</p>
<p>Focusing on the past crimes of Germany creates cognitive dissonance with reality. Presently, German Jewry is flourishing. There is no place in Europe that is more welcoming and helpful to Jewish people. This week, Germany invited refugees to make a new life on the same soil that could not tolerate non-Aryans and was soaked in their blood.</p>
<p>What happened? How did Germany go from being an aggressor to being a savior in a few short decades? What about the stereotypes and assumptions? Can Germans really be friendly?</p>
<p>The answer is of course they can. More importantly, they have been friendly.</p>
<p>Through legislation, education, social programs, and plain old kindness, Germany has produced a tolerant and benevolent society. It is built on top of the ashes of people who were murdered because they were different. As Danielle Berin writes in the <a href="http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/germanys_moral_courage" target="_blank">Jewish Journal</a>: “Seventy years ago, who could have imagined that the country that nearly annihilated God’s Chosen would one day be chosen as a light among nations?&#8221;</p>
<p>In many ways, we all have a little Germany in us. We’ve all sinned grievously. We’ve all harmed others. Others identify us based on our worst behavior. Sometimes, we identify with the way others may think of us. We don’t believe that we can change because “leopards don’t change their spots.”</p>
<p>Look to Germany for inspiration. A short 75 years ago, Germany and many of her citizens were efficient murderers. They were stoics with no soul. But two generations later, we’ve discovered that change is possible. If they did it, we can do it.</p>
<p>Perhaps above all, take hope for the future. I hear equally horrible, and oftentimes deserved, descriptions of Arabs and Middle Eastern Muslims. People are certain that they are inherently evil or hardwired for violence. We thought the same things about Germans a just a few years ago. Germany showed us that Jew hatred and Jew killing is a temporary problem meant to be solved, not a conclusion meant to be presumed eternally.</p>
<p>Freedom, justice, and modernity are the tools a society needs to be just. We must encourage these ideals anywhere they are lacking. Reciprocation of bigotry or aggression in response to violence may embolden the baser elements in a society. Of course, we must be careful and protect ourselves, but our primary efforts must be in building good societies. Like Germany.</p>
<p>Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur loom on the horizon. Around the world, Jewish people will be asking for forgiveness and promising to do better. Many people will just go through the motions. They’ll be certain to check off the boxes they need to cover in order to earn a prize. But many others take it seriously and try to refine their character. It’s too easy, and too lazy, for us to settle into our comfortable roles as we have been. It’s too easy, and too lazy, to put others into the same old tired boxes. Instead, let’s celebrate the human capacity for change and embrace the infinite possibilities for a better future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Ezra is a friend of mine and I think the point he makes in this essay is important and very relevant to many of the discussions and issues that we discuss on this blog and my Facebook page. &#8211; ef</em></p>
<h3><strong>A Guest Post by <a href="https://twitter.com/ezrabutler" target="_blank">Ezra Butler</a></strong></h3>
<p>Growing up Orthodox, I was always instructed that Rosh Hashana is a time for self-introspection, unlike the secular New Year which is markedly different in its celebration. We were taught that we are judged and forgiven by God during the ten days from Rosh Hashana to Yom Kippur. Even today, I try to take this period to quietly take stock of my actions of the previous year and identify hopes for the upcoming one.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, as both my Facebook newsfeed and Twitter stream have been rife with negative judgments about current events from all sides, I kept wishing for a rise in empathy.<span id="more-8867"></span></p>
<p>Last week, I caught a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102001075">short interview</a> with Kenneth Feinberg, the victims&#8217; compensation consultant for 9/11 and the BP oil spill, and most lately, the accident victims of GM’s faulty ignition switches.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/01/days-atonement-empathy/empatia-psicologia-tenerife-psicosalud/" rel="attachment wp-att-8869"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8869" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Empatia-psicologia-tenerife-psicosalud.jpg?w=980" alt="Empatia-psicologia-tenerife-psicosalud" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>When the interviewer asked him about how the meetings with the families usually go, Mr. Feinberg said, “It has nothing to do with money.” He continued to explain, “When families meet with me, they have two objectives. Either one, they want to vent about life’s unfairness. ‘Why did my son die, Mr. Feinberg?’ Or they want to validate the memory of a lost loved one. My son was a great student, he would have gone far. He was a wonderful boy. Or my daughter was terrific. It gets very very emotional.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I heard him say these words, my mind began racing. How could it be that the man called the “Compensation Czar” of the United States, due to his work as the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, basically describe the secret behind his success as being really empathetic?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>To better understand empathy, I thought back to an emotional phone call I received from my brother Menachem last week. He had just left a devastating Shiva house for a young man who passed suddenly in his early 30’s, who he did not know at all.</p>
<p>There had been silence, only punctuated by crying.</p>
<p>As Menachem sat with the crying mother, a Ukrainian-Jewish immigrant, he shared a story I had told him over a decade ago.</p>
<p>During my sophomore year of University, I had spent Passover in Kharkov, Urkaine organizing a seder and educating the local youth. A local Jewish university student had told me that becoming circumcised was tantamount to announcing one’s decision to leave Ukraine. A circumcised soldier in the compulsory military could be harassed, beaten or worse.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the mournful mother became reanimated.</p>
<p>She began to tell my brother a story in broken English about her son as a child. In the USSR in the 1980’s, circumcision was illegal. In the city of Vinnitsa, now-Ukraine, parents would wait until there was a large enough group of children wanting circumcision, and then bring in a Mohel from outside the city. They would have the circumcisions in a specially rented apartment, so that none of the parents would be tied to the event. The situation was so secretive, the parents were not even informed when it would take place ahead of time.</p>
<p>Her son was eight years old at the time. He called his mother to tell her that it was happening that day, and he would have her in mind to reenergize their commitment to Judaism, and that he was OK to do it without her there. Undeterred, she told her boss that she needed to take the rest of the day off. But by the time she arrived, he had already been circumcised.</p>
<p>The eight year old’s choice became more poignant when he told his mother that he didn’t want to be on the swim team anymore, because his teammates would mock him and beat him up, because he was Jewish.</p>
<p>The mother paused and remembered about a very religious visitor clad in black and white from the day before. “I was one of the other boys circumcised at the same time as your son,” he had announced. He informed the grieving mother part of the circumcision story she never knew. “We were all scared and nervous,” he continued, “but your son had the courage to go first.”</p>
<p>All the children in that apartment have since left Ukraine, and are now either living in Israel or the US. The visitor explained that he has been studying in a Yeshiva in Lakewood, New Jersey for the past dozen years, largely based on the example set by her son as a young boy.</p>
<p>But his mother never understood, until Menachem’s brief story, how hard life had been for her son in Ukraine, because her son protected his mother from knowing the true extent of the pain.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In an interview in 2008 with <a href="http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/what-ive-learned-kenneth-feinberg/">The Washingtonian</a>, Mr. Feinberg said about victim reparations for future terrorist disasters: &#8220;Don&#8217;t ask one person to act like Solomon and try to calculate the value of lives. To be judge, jury, accountant, lawyer, rabbi, etc., is very, very difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps this year, we can take upon ourselves to heed Mr. Feinberg’s advice, to not be judge, jury and accountant to others. We should re-learn the power of empathy, whether it’s to a mother who tragically lost her son or daughter, someone who lost their job or just someone having a bad day. We should remember to listen, ask questions and share something from our own lives, just to show that we understand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rosh Hashanah is a funny holiday. It’s not funny because of the humorous High Holidays jokes that rabbis tell. The humor of Rosh Hashanah is to be found in its inherent contradictions.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of Rosh Hashanah is that it is our day of judgment, when every person’s fate is determined by G-d. Who will live? Who will die? Who will prosper? Who will experience failure? The days and weeks preceding Rosh Hashanah are filled with awe and reverence. We seek to make amends to anyone we might have hurt or slighted in the past year. It’s a propitious time for introspection and focus on the task at hand, teshuva &#8211; repentance.<span id="more-8847"></span></p>
<p>When the big day finally arrives, it begins with a short evening service followed by a festive dinner at home.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/23/rosh-hashanah-is-the-sweetest-day-of-judgment/s591346629795598172_p788_i1_w1280/" rel="attachment wp-att-8848"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8848" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/s591346629795598172_p788_i1_w1280.jpeg?fit=600%2C600" alt="s591346629795598172_p788_i1_w1280" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> At the Rosh Hashanah evening meal, it is customary to dip apples into honey. Some people serve sweet challah at the meal and dip it into honey. Symbolic foods (pomegranates, fish, fish heads, carrots, among others) are eaten during the meal. Through it all, there seems to be nary a thought of forgiveness or judgment.</p>
<p>The next day, a few hours are spent in prayer in synagogue. While the Rosh Hashanah prayers are a bit longer than usual, they do not express thoughts of repentance. In fact, the focus seems to be on the shofar blasts &#8212; and more shofar blasts. There are a lot of shofar blasts. But still, no crying or begging for mercy.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a walk is taken to a stream or lake where the tashlich prayer is recited. In this symbolic ritual, we ask that our sins be cast off so that we may enter the new year free of sin. Sin and forgiveness are implied in the prayer, but tashlich can hardly be described as the “grunt work” of perfecting oneself or changing one’s character. Certainly our sins are not cast off just because we say tashlich. It is simply a symbolic ritual that reminds us to repent.</p>
<p>Which leads us to the punchline of Rosh Hashanah. How many ways can we distract ourselves from the essence of what happens on Rosh Hashanah?! Apples, honey, fun symbolic foods, shofar, tashlich&#8230;there a host of rituals that don’t help us repent, but rather take our minds off the primary focus of the day!</p>
<p>Since it is the Day of Judgment, Rosh Hashanah could be a really hard day. People don’t really enjoy hard days. We already have Yom Kippur on the calendar as a designated hard day. If Rosh Hashanah were to be celebrated as two more hard days, it could actually take away from the overall High Holidays experience.</p>
<p>That the sages implemented rituals, traditions, and customs for Rosh Hashanah is actually fortunate. While they seem to skirt around the primary focus of the day, these small acts remind us, in a sweet or interesting way, that Rosh Hashanah is a judgment day. The rituals of Rosh Hashanah are intended to appeal to our sense of taste, our appreciation for music &#8211; even rudimentary music like the shofar blast. Rituals such as tashlich, which include a trip outdoors and powerful symbolic gestures, are all ways of arousing our spirits to repent without banging us over the head with the “REPENT OR DIE” anvil.</p>
<p>These special customs of Rosh Hashanah give this supreme day of religious obligation and spiritual accounting a flair of merriment so that we will be more engaged in the day. It’s the old marketing principle that uses association to lure the customers into endorsing or purchasing a product. If it looks good and feels good, it has a better chance in the marketplace. Part of what makes things feel good and look good are the favorable associations we make in our minds.</p>
<p>Rosh Hashanah is eased along by positive associations. We enjoy good food, the shofar evokes a deep and stirring nostalgia inside our souls, and tashlich takes us outside the synagogue. The distractions are not really distractions as much as they are bunting and balloons decorating a banquet hall. They may take the eye off the event for a moment, but overall they contribute to an atmosphere that is flavorful, fun, and festive.</p>
<p>Don’t look at the Rosh Hashanah traditions as separate from the Day of Judgment. Rather, they are the trappings that enhance the Day of Judgment. Enjoy the sweet food. Drink in the sounds of the shofar. Bask in the sunshine during tashlich. These are the rituals that give our holiday its special taste. Make them important. Make them meaningful. Make them a significant part of your Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p>When Rosh Hashanah is regarded as a special time to which we look forward, when we value the day and when we have good feelings about Rosh Hashanah, we are far more likely to put more of our heart and soul into the Day of Judgment, and that will certainly have a positive effect on our verdict.</p>
<p>May we all merit a happy sweet New Year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, the Israeli Rabbinate granted their coveted Rabbinic ordination to several dozen new rabbis. A cousin of mine was among the celebrants and I was very happy for him upon this great achievement. This cousin is an American born charedi learning in Kollel. He kind of defies stereotypical categories &#8211; yes it runs in the family &#8211; but if you saw him, you would assume he was an idealistic charedi who is living a very simple Israeli lifestyle for the sake of Torah study. And that sort of fits.</p>
<p>When I saw photos of the event, I could not help but notice something remarkable that also defies stereotypes.<span id="more-8837"></span> The people celebrating their ordination that day were from every walk of Orthodox Jewish life.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/23/a-remarkable-rainbow-of-rabbis-2/rb1/" rel="attachment wp-att-8838"><img class="alignright wp-image-8838 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rb1.jpg?resize=600%2C375" alt="rb1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> It was uncanny. If you dream up almost any type of Orthodox Judaism, there was a guy from that version of Orthodox Judaism who received semicha that day. Truly, it was as much a celebration of ordination as it was a celebration of the diversity within Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The beauty of a rainbow is found in its vibrant colors. Each color stands out on its own and also bleeds into the next color so that it is impossible to say where one color starts and another ends. But all those colors are just refractions from the same light. That makes it even more beautiful. This ceremony celebrated one light that refracts into many colors and styles too. The light of God, Torah, and Judaism refracted into vibrant Orthodox Jewish communities. It was a beautiful rainbow.</p>
<p>I can think of no message more important and more powerful as we prepare for the High Holidays. Superficially, there are many ways to do Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. The packaging is different but the content is the same. The body may appear to be different, but at the soul level, it is all one. The packaging is flexible and malleable. The soul is eternal.</p>
<p>We approach the Days of Awe with an awesome responsibility for ourselves, our families, and each other. Everyone has different favorite colors. Color preferences are like opinions, everybody has them. But the colors themselves cannot bicker and fight about which is the true light. They are all just a sliver of true light. None are the light on their own and the light needs all of them.</p>
<p>Same goes for us.</p>
<p>Mazel tov to the varied recipients of Rabbinic ordination. Mazel tov to my cousin. Mazel tov to all of us. Their celebration is our celebration too.</p>
<p>Here is a small selection of the many photos from that day illustrating this point in living color. Photo Credits: <a href="http://www.dat.gov.il/rpic" target="_blank">Ministry of Religious Services</a></p>
<p><em>Enjoy the photos and see it for yourself. (Click for maximum enjoyment.)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A slight detour from the important discussion of the previous few essays. This is like a case study. We&#8217;ll get to the next essay soon.</em></p>
<p>Everyone on the Internet with a Jewish grandmother went apple picking yesterday and took photos for Rosh Hashanah. It was impossible not to notice Somehow this has become a tradition that more and more people are doing every year. I love it. It&#8217;s a lovely addition to the High Holiday season.</p>
<p>We always try to do something creative for our Shana Tova cards.<span id="more-8803"></span> It&#8217;s one of our favorite traditions. Some years we have used apples and honey as props.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/22/picking-new-apples-for-rosh-hashanah/day-10/" rel="attachment wp-att-8804"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8804" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Day-10.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Day 10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> But recently we&#8217;ve been using candy in the photos to wish people a sweet new year. The last couple of years we used giant rainbow lollipops. This year we also thought about going apple picking and getting some action shots for the Shana Tova greeting card. So we started Googling for a local apple picking orchard.</p>
<p>Turns out there is nowhere to pick apples in Los Angeles within a two hour drive of our home. We&#8217;re martyrs for a good Rosh Hashanah photo opportunity and apple picking was a good idea for the photo, but we&#8217;re not actually insane so we did not drive four hours round trip to take a few pictures. We used cotton candy instead.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing. Apples don&#8217;t really work for people in Los Angeles. We don&#8217;t have apple orchards here and it&#8217;s not really the season for apples. September is usually our hottest month and the leaves here don&#8217;t change colors at all. The Fall seasonal elements are foreign to Souther California and like winter imagery, we try our best to superimpose them here.</p>
<p>So for us, apples on Rosh Hashanah is an anachronism at worst and an anatopism as best. None of us would be thinking about apples if not for the preexisting relationship between Rosh Hashanah and apples. We do it anyway. It&#8217;s not a bad thing to create nostalgia around things that don&#8217;t really fit into your current social and physical environment, as Orthodox Jews we do it all the time. It&#8217;s part of what creates our personal Jewish experience. For Ashkenazi Jews, the Jewy foods of Eastern Europe are Jewish. But if not for their Jewishness, I question whether people would dream of eating the majority of those foods. They are anachronisms. But we have a strong attachment to them because of nostalgia. Most of the other symbolic Rosh Hashanah foods are even more anachronistic and they certainly are meaningful to us today.</p>
<p>Yet, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">I&#8217;ll say what I&#8217;ve been saying again</a>, albeit in a different context, we should feel empowered to create new Orthodox traditions and experiences that match the social and physical milieu of 21st Century America. If the Talmud was being written today, I don&#8217;t think apples would have the same significance in our Talmud as they did 15o0 years ago. Apples held a prominent place in ancient mythology and symbolism. In our world, the word apple is likely more closely associated with technology than fruit. It&#8217;s just a different world. That is not a reason not to enjoy the time honored symbolism of apples and honey. But it might be a reason to think about what symbolic foods we might find meaningful this time of year if we started with a blank slate.</p>
<p>Lollipops and cotton candy, anyone?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most prominent themes of the High Holidays is our relationship with God as expressed by <em>Avinu Malkeinu.</em> This stirring prayer that has is origins in the Talmud makes use of a dual metaphor that informs so many of our thoughts and prayers this time of year.</p>
<p>Typically, the two metaphors represent different aspects of the way God relates to us and the way we relate to God. On the one hand God is our father and loves us like a father loves his children. We are God&#8217;s children and we look to God the way a child looks to a father. This is a compassionate, loving relationship that gives us comfort that no matter what</p>
<p>On the other hand God is our King. In this aspect of our relationship with God we find ourselves cowering in fear of God&#8217;s majesty and greatness. God is Master of the Universe. It&#8217;s God&#8217;s world and we are just guests in God&#8217;s world for a little while. This is meant to inspire reverence and respect for God.</p>
<p><span id="more-7604"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7607" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/15.jpg?w=980" alt="15" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Put together, the two sides of the God Coin illuminate our attitudes this time of year. God loves us and is our Father, but God is also our King. There is plenty to say on this dichotomy. Perhaps we can take the usual interpretations of this dual metaphor one step deeper.</p>
<p>One does not choose one&#8217;s father. Fathers are imposed upon us. Everyone has a father. There is nothing particularly interesting about having a father. It&#8217;s built into the system. But most importantly, we can&#8217;t swap (biological) fathers. For better or worse, we&#8217;re stuck.</p>
<p>Monarchs are different. It&#8217;s true that one seems to be stuck with the king of the land where one is born. But the truth is that kings come and go. Borders change and people move. It&#8217;s a pure choice, but decided to pledge fealty to one&#8217;s king is a form of personal subjugation. It takes an act by the subject to crystallize the King and Subject relationship. If you don&#8217;t like your king you can try to mount a revolt or leave the area of jurisdiction. One day the king will die. Kings are not permanent nor are they automatic.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to God is there a choice? The kingship of God is not dependent on anything that we can do. It is automatic. We cannot leave God&#8217;s jurisdiction and move somewhere else to find another God. We are stuck.</p>
<p>That is why we also compare God to a father. While it&#8217;s true that God is like a king, the metaphor is incomplete. Comparing God to a king only goes so far. God cannot be deposed nor can one find a better or different God. That&#8217;s why we also need to compare God to a father. God is a king that is imposed upon us. We cannot trade Gods nor do we have a choice about who our God will be. In this sense, God as our father illustrates the imperative nature of God&#8217;s kingship over us.</p>
<p>Conversely, when we relate to God as a father we can feel stuck in a negative sense. We can wish we had a different father or we can dream about being free from the shadow of our parents. This is why we sometimes need to relate to God as our king. We voluntarily accept God as our king and as our father. This aspect of God as our king transforms our relationship with God as a father. It&#8217;s not just that we deal with God like a sometimes petulant child that would love to break free of God. We willingly subjugate ourselves in God&#8217;s kingdom even though we God is our father.</p>
<p>Above all else, I think this dual metaphor must inspire us to strive to be good sons and daughters to God as well as good subjects. Sometimes we act toward God with the love and admiration of a son or daughter. Other times we need to draw on the strength of relating to God as subjects in God&#8217;s eternal kingdom. It&#8217;s not enough to think about God as our father and king. We must also think about how <em>we are</em> God&#8217;s children and the people who live in God&#8217;s kingdom. The metaphor can&#8217;t stop with how we think about God. The metaphor needs to affect the way we think about ourselves as well.</p>
<p>When we appreciate the metaphor of <em>Avinu Malkeinu</em> we can feel a sense of love and fear that mixes together in the perfect service of God cocktail. Drink up!</p>

As usual, I met some very interesting and wonderful people through the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Many people stopped by to dip the apple in the honey which is not as easy as it looks with the nice ocean breeze wreaking havoc with honey drips. Some stepped into the shul for a few moments and we had some lovely conversations. Everyone got free apples and honey and an open invitation to join us at the Shul on the Beach for High Holidays services.</p>
<p>Of all the people that stopped by, three were of particular interest.<span id="more-6213"></span></p>
<p>One guy was an Iranian Muslim. He said his father was very religious and used to pray his morning services for three hours. It only takes a few minutes for most people, but his father was so pious that it took him hours. Then he told me the entire story of Muhammad. He said his father had great respect for Jewish people and used to study the Torah. This fellow is not Muslim. He claims he is &#8220;everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then there was the film student from Boston. She recently came to LA as part of a program with Boston University. Earlier that day her mother was guilting her about where she was going to go to hear the Shofar on Rosh Hashanah. So she told her mom she didn&#8217;t know yet, but she was definitely going to services &#8220;on the beach&#8221;. She had never even heard of shul but when she saw the shul she said it was &#8220;<em>beshert</em>&#8220;! Now she is planning on joining us for services. Her mother will be happy.</p>
<p>My third encounter was with an Intactvist across the way. He gets his own post. Tune in tomorrow for my conversation with the Venice Boardwalk Intactivist.</p>
<p>The High Holidays are a magical time everywhere. But at The Shul on the Beach they are particularly inspiring. Jews from every walk of life, with every level of observance, and of every background join together for services. Everyone is welcome and everyone is made to feel welcome. We invite you to join us.</p>
<p><strong>Rosh Hashanah</strong> is September 16 at sundown through nightfall on September 18. Shofar blowing at The Shul on the Beach will be around 11 AM on September 17 and 18.</p>
<p><strong>Yom Kippur</strong> is September 25 at sundown for K0l Nidre through nightfall on September 26.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to join us for services whether for the entire thing or just a few moments. If you want a seat with your name on it, call or email the PJC office at info@pjcenter.com.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/twitter1.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2878" title="twitter" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/twitter1.gif?resize=240%2C180" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Jewish High Holidays (or perhaps more appropriately High Holy Days) are now in the rear-view mirror. Rosh Hashanah was two weeks and ago and Yom Kippur was this past weekend.</p>
<p>I noticed something that almost all Jewish Twitter users must have noticed as the Holidays drew nearer. Google and Yahoo Search track the most popular searches for any given time period. There is much social commentary and benefit to observing what the most popular trends on Google and Yahoo.</p>
<p>Similarly, Twitter tracks the most popular terms found in Twitter Updates (not searches). This is perhaps even more telling as it tracks what people are writing about as opposed to what they are curious about.<span id="more-2873"></span></p>
<p>The Twitter Home Page (before login) has a scrolling account of the hottest Twitter trends.</p>
<p>On the eve of Rosh Hashanah the number one trending topic was Shana Tova (Hebrew for &#8211; Have a Good Year). On the eve of Yom Kippur the top trending topic was Yom Kippur. These were worldside trends; not local trends for New York or Los Angeles (very Jewish cities).</p>
<p>I find it incredible that a miniscule population of Jewish people can have such an impact on the Twitter Trends. It is also remarkable that although the vast majority of Jewish people are not very religious, these Holy Days still carry significance for so many.</p>
<p>(Follow me and many other wonderful people on Twitter by creating an account at <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">http://twitter.com</a> and follow me and <a href="http://twitter.com/efink" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/efink</a>.)</p>

<p><em>This post has been crossposted to DovBear &#8211; </em><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/09/ncaa-and-contemporary-orthodox-judaism.html"><em>The NCAA and Contemporary Orthodox Judaism</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Last year, Jeremiah Masoli was the quarterback for the Oregon Ducks. He got into some trouble with the law and committed second degree burglary and misdemeanor possession of marijuana. The Ducks cut him from the team and Masoli transferred to Ole Miss.</p>
<p>At first he was considered a transfer and would be forced to sit out the year. He appealed and won the appeal and is now eligible to play for Ole Miss. Apparently, the NCAA does not feel that breaking the law warrants a suspension.</p>
<p>For the last five years, the NCAA has been investigating Reggie Bush and benefits his family received from a potential agent. In finding that Bush broke NCAA rules by accepting gifts (like a house for his family) the NCAA sanctioned USC <span id="more-2808"></span>by taking away scholarships, banning them from bowl games and taking away personal awards. Apparently, the NCAA feels that breaking ITS rules warrants severe punishment.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Rabbi Weil wrote a wonderful article on how Orthodox Judaism has morphed into caring more about its own rules than the rules of society and the laws of our country. (Link: <a href="http://bit.ly/aWdl9X">OU.org</a>) We concentrate so much on the rituals and customs of Orthodox Judaism that set us apart from other religions that sometimes the basics of citizenship get ignored. It is especially egregious because our law has many of those same laws!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost just the NCAA. It seems like we care more about our own rules than the laws of the land. This is wrong.</p>
<p>As we begin a New Year, I think we need to recommit ourselves to the universal laws of good all the while celebrating those laws that make us different. We can afford to ignore neither.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/200573745-001.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2804" title="200573745-001" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/200573745-001.jpg?resize=200%2C240" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>As we approach the Jewish New Year there is an effort  to at least attempt to enter Rosh Hashanah clean from sin. Unfortunately, we have made bad choices, we have done wrong in our lives. How are we to start a fresh year with joy and confidence if we are carrying all the baggage of mistakes we have made. It can be depressing thinking about bad choices we have made. They all have consequences and we may regret what we have done. But regret does not fix the harms we have caused. Regret can have a debilitating effect if it holds us back from achieving our goals as we wallow in self pity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a concept of Teshuva, repentance, in Judaism. The word repentance generally refers to a person to has decided to commit their life to God (see Wikipedia on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentance" target="_blank">repentance</a>). But what of someone who already has committed their life to God and is trying to do their best to make the best moral choices in their life but has made mistakes? Is there a mechanism for that person to somehow come back to God? Aren&#8217;t they already committed to God? What more can they do?</p>
<p>In Judaism there is such a mechanism. <span id="more-2801"></span>That is what we call Teshuva. Anyone can do teshuva and everyone should be doing teshuva all the time. Any time we make the wrong choice we have created separation between ourselves and God who is Perfection. Our lack of perfection stands in the way of being with God and Perfection. The further we are from perfection, the further we are from God. Teshuva gets us closer to perfection.</p>
<p>But how? Once we have acted and done wrong the deed is done. Can teshuva make it disappear? Is it magic?</p>
<p>Compounding the problem is the idea that God is the Ultimate Judge. That means that if an act is &#8220;bad&#8221; it deserves immediate consequences. There is no judge, no jury, no lawyers, no plea bargain deals, Ultimate Judgment means that every act has an exact and precise Divine Reaction. That is how the physical world works as well. If ones steals something, the item is stolen immediately. There is no grace period or gray area. If one kills someone, the person is dead. If one cheats on their wife, they have cheated. In the physical world, our actions have immediate, real reactions. That is what is meant by &#8220;judgment&#8221; (poor translation of the hebrew word din). There is an immediate reaction to our actions from God as well. The distance created by our lack of perfection is instantaneous. How do we repent from acts that are done? If someone is dead because of our action, no amount of sorrow or regret will bring the person back. Same with infidelity. How can teshuva fix the immediate reactions of our actions?</p>
<p>This leaves us with an additional question: While it is true that God acts with judgment, God also acts with mercy (rachamim) how does mercy reconcile with judgment if judgment means that every action has an immediate physical and spiritual reaction?</p>
<p>The Ramchal in Mesillas Yesharim provides a wonderful explanation. First, he explains that the mercy of God is that while every action does have an immediate spiritual consequence, that consequence can be suspended for a period of time giving the person time to repent.</p>
<p>But what of the repentance? How does that work? He says that every action really has two parts. The first part is the formation of intent. The idea and the desire to act are the first part of every action. Then we act; that is the second part. The action causes the immediate result. Physical and spiritual. Each action is &#8220;owned&#8221; by its actor. So when one makes a wrong choice the act is connected to them. The action is the end of a chain that hooks up to the actor. The hook on the end of the chain that is connected to the actor is the desire for the result. So a flow chart would look like this:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Actor&#8212;-&gt;Desire&#8212;-&gt;Action&#8212;-&gt;Result.</h3>
<p>The result is only connected to the actor through the desire. Teshuva is the process of &#8220;undoing&#8221; the desire for the action and its result. True repentance occurs when the actor wishes with all their heart that they had never acted the way they did. When the person truly regrets their choice the desire part of the action can be unhooked from the actor! If there is no hook connectig the action to the actor (the desire) then the actor and the action are no longer associated with one another. That is teshuva. Repentance is disassociating the action from the actor by removing the desire to act. Of course, in order for the desire to be disassociated from the actor the actor must everything in their power to fix the horrible results of their action. But once that is done, repentance can be achieved and the action can be clipped away from the actor.</p>
<p>Certainly, the deed is done. What&#8217;s done is done. We cannot change the past. But we can change our association with the past.</p>
<p>This kind of repentance leaves no room for baggage and guilt. It is a clean break from the past and allows us to move forward to a future of better choices.</p>

Folks are generally more friendly and generous under the &#8220;guise&#8221; of Holiday Spirit.</p>
<p>Seeing as Rosh Hashana (the Jewish New Year) is a mere 9 days away, if we were Christian and the New Year was 9 days away, we would be knee-deep in the &#8220;Holiday Spirit&#8221;. A congregant of mine told me an anecdote that would fit neatly in the &#8220;Holiday Spirit&#8221; if we had an equivalent.<span id="more-2769"></span></p>
<p>This fellow was shopping at the local butcher (Western Kosher) and he noticed an orthodox Jewish woman had stacked her yogurt on top of her chicken. Now, most orthodox Jews don&#8217;t think twice about that kind of move, but there are some people who are new to religious Judaism who prefer to keep their milk and meat products separate in their shopping carts. (No, there is no reason to do this, it just happens that fellow in the story does separate his meat and milk in his shopping cart.) So the fellow thinks about saying something to the nice lady but thought it was a silly thing to bring to her attention because he realized that there is nothing wrong with stacking cold yogurt in a package on top on cold chicken in a package.</p>
<p>By now, she had caught his attention and he noticed that she was holding a list with at least 8 or 9 items. Her overhears that woman say to the manager &#8220;Please put $1000 in the Schwartz* account. $1000 in the Goldberg account. $1000 in the Cohen account.&#8221; and so she went for a few minutes, quite simply crediting at least 8 or 9 families with $1000 out of her own pocket. This fellow was witnessing a true act of charity. Charity given in the most respectful way with no begging, handouts or embarrassment. An estimated $10,000 went to the less fortunate of Los Angeles last week from this woman alone.</p>
<p>That is a universal Holiday Spirit.</p>
<p>*names changed (duh)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1225" title="unity" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/unity.jpg?resize=180%2C180" alt="unity" data-recalc-dims="1" />Rosh Hashana at <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a> was wonderful. The services were inspiring, the attendance was excellent and the mood properly reflected the importance of the days.</p>
<p>I spoke from the pulpit several times over the holiday.</p>
<p>There was certainly an over-arching theme to my sermons. Each had its own individual message but overall they reflected an idea that I feel is central to Rosh Hashana, judgment, repentance, Judaism and Humanity.</p>
<p>It is too easy to get  caught up in ourselves. We hope for a good verdict, we try to be the best people we can be as individuals.</p>
<p>For me, the greater challenge is fitting in the group. Every time I spoke over the Holiday, the underlying theme was Unity.<span id="more-1224"></span>Each person really has three identities.</p>
<p>One is our own personal accomplishments. Everything that one does in their life goes into this category and those things have value on their own. We look at the person in a vacuum and assess their achievements as an individual. Everyone has unique talents and abilities that make then who they are.</p>
<p>The second identity is the person&#8217;s group. Everyone is part of various groups. Whether by religion, race, political party, trade or family we all belong to groups. Those groups form a part of our identity. But each group member&#8217;s individual role is not relevant. The group has an identity and by association with that group, that identity becomes the identity of everyone in the group.</p>
<p>The third identity is the most important. It is the combination of number 1 and number 2. It is how we interact with the group using our individual talents and abilities. This identity is the meeting point of the indidual and the group. If the individual is selfish and uses their talents and abilities for their own personal gain and ignores the group, the person has failed in this identity. But if the person is able to part if the group and use their individualism to elevate the group, then in turn, they elevate themselves.</p>
<p>No where is this third identity clearer to the observer than in competitive team sports. The individual performer has his or her own talents and abilities. What separates the great ones from the rest, is their ability  to use those skills and elevate the team.</p>
<p>It is no different in real life. We all have skills and we are all part of groups. We need to use those skills to elevate our groups, not just ourselves.</p>
<p>It was particularly appropriate to find a <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/6975/more-than-a-game-preview" target="_blank">short post on the NBA Truehoop Blog about this issue today</a>.</p>
<p>LeBron James has a new movie. It is supposed to be about teamwork, but as Truehoop so eloquently puts it, the preview completely fails in this regard.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The bummer about it, however, is that the movie is all about teamwork, but the undeniable message of the preview&#8217;s format (James, shooting alone in a gym) is that celebrity trumps all.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Watch the preview below and you will see just what they mean.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="325" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RlEi1iYCukQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="325" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RlEi1iYCukQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Good imagery for the wrong message. We need to be team players in sports and more importantly in life.</p>
