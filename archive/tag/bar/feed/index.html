				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6744" alt="gone-fishin-1.jpg" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/gone-fishin-1.jpg.jpeg" width="400" height="300" />I did not study appropriately for the bar exam in July. I was justifiably distracted, but losing a month of review doomed me. I was still pretty close, so I am confident that with more attention I can slay the California Bar Exam 55% Pass Rate Dragon. However, the review course will require 8-10 hours of my time every day. I don&#8217;t have the time to write blog posts, respond to comments, post on Facebook or Twitter, and study properly while being a father, husband, and rabbi of Pacific Jewish Center. Something has to give. In this instance, it will be the Internet.</p>
<p>I will not be updating the blog until after the bar exam, nor will I be posting on Facebook or Twitter during that time.</p>
<p>There are nearly 1000 blog posts on this blog. At least a couple of them are pretty good. Personally, I find it especially interesting to read old blog posts, even my own. If you find an old post you like, leave a comment or share it on Facebook or Twitter (or the graveyard that is Google Plus). My Facebook wall will not be open for friends to post new links but you can browse my Timeline for some of the best discussions of smart, diverse people on the Internet and carry on the conversation without me.</p>
<p>If you are learning the Daf with us, don&#8217;t worry the Daf Yomi site will be updated regularly. For Twitter updates when the Daf is posted you will need to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/tweettherabbi" target="_blank">@tweettherabbi</a>.</p>
<p>Have fun without me. I will miss you all. I mean it.</p>
<p>It will be a challenge to stay off the airwaves, but it is a necessary measure.</p>
<p>Until March, I bid you adieu.</p>
<p>If you need me, I will be answering emails.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pass-fail-200.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6486" title="pass-fail-200" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/pass-fail-200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a>As much as it hurts to report, since I know a lot of you have been asking out of genuine concern and interest, I am sorry to say that unfortunately I did not pass the bar exam.</p>
<p>Honestly, it would have been a miracle if I had passed it. I spent a good four weeks in the midst of the 10 week study period tending to other pressing matters and was never able to fully recover the time. I held out hope that my writing would be good enough to outweigh my lack of knowledge, but alas it was not to be.</p>
<p>It is very painful right now. My friends are all celebrating, and I am not. It hurts to be left out. But I knew all along it was extremely unlikely that I would pass. It still hurts.</p>
<p>I will be getting back on the horse and putting forth a maximum effort this go-round. I really believe that if I do my best to prepare, I will pass the February exam.</p>
<p>That also means that I will be going offline for a a couple of months at some point. In the meantime the blog and Facebook / Twitter will continue for a bit longer. But soon I am pulling the plug, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support and encouragement along the way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/im-back.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5856" title="im back" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/im-back-300x177.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="177" /></a>The Bar Exam is over. It was brutal. I really hope I passed the exam. I really hate having to wait 15 weeks for the results, but such is life.</p>
<p>Anyway, I missed you all over the hiatus. I did check in to Facebook and Twitter from time to time to see how life was on the Internet but I did not post anything on this blog, blog comments, Facebook, or Twitter, and obviously not on Google+ either.</p>
<p>I am sure some of you wonder what that was like. Well, to be honest, my quality of life did not drastically improve. Perhaps it was because instead of blogging I was engaging in the sado-masochistic ritual of bar review. So I can&#8217;t comment on the usual questions like &#8220;is life better without social media?&#8221;.<span id="more-5836"></span></p>
<p>But I can comment on what it is like not to debate anyone on the Internet and what is like not to share opinions and thoughts on things that matter. It&#8217;s no fun. For people like me, discussion and debate is quite literally the spice of life. I missed it terribly and I am happy to be back at it.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to thank everyone for their good luck wishes and birthday wishes while I was away. I think I caught most of them during my sporadic check ins. I apologize for not acknowledging and thanking you all at the time, but I made a commitment not to blog or post anything on social media and I wanted to keep my commitment. So thank you and I&#8217;m sorry for letting you feel like you were being ignored.</p>
<p>A ton of interesting things happened since we last spoke. I plan to write a few posts on the items that are still relevant, albeit no longer fresh. My first post is posted already here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/07/26/the-people-who-you-see-while-taking-california-bar-exam/" target="_blank">People Who You See While Taking the California Bar Exam</a>. Law school grads and lawyers might like my list. I thought it a good way to ease back into things.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you want to know my opinion on anything that happened in the last 6 weeks feel free to leave a comment here, on Facebook, or send me a Tweet. If I have something to say, I&#8217;ll leave a reply.</p>
