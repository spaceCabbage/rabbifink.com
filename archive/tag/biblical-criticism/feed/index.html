				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NY Times reports that there is a religious group that is losing even some of its most committed members because of what they are finding on the Internet. Sound familiar? The group is not orthodox Judaism, rather it is the Mormons.</p>
<p>Some people are quick to point out that orthodox Judaism is suffering a similar fate. According to the narrative, people get online, they see that their religion can be challenged and that there are many other perspectives in the world, and sometimes they leave. We discussed this in the context of the chasidic world here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/22/can-judaism-survive-the-internet/">Can Judaism Survive the Internet?</a>)</p>
<p>Mormons are finding that their religion is so nascent, their beliefs are based on so many contradictions and inconsistencies, and their prophet was a less than admirably role model, that their faith is irrevocably shaken. Some leave. Others stay and want to modernize it.<span id="more-7410"></span></p>
<p>In the context of chasidic Judaism I think the comparison is somewhat fair. The lifestyle is a fairly recent innovation, the beliefs can seem contradictory at times, and for some, finding out that a shtreimel is not holy can shake their faith. The Internet might be &#8220;to blame&#8221; for those people discovering that they have options.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7411" alt="google_1674887b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/google_1674887b-600x375.jpg" /></p>
<p>But I think most people who leave and use the Internet as a tool to assist them in their journey are bothered by social issues in the community. They dislike the lifestyle, or they think the leadership is corrupt, or the allure of freedom from religion is too great. For them, the Internet is more like a lobby where they can meet likeminded people. The Internet doesn&#8217;t cause the doubt, but it helps them deal with it and sometime it helps them leave.</p>
<p>The last few days have demonstrated another Internet driven issue in orthodox Judaism.  A local issue can become a global issue. A rabbi who writes controversial things becomes international news. Further, the materials that form the substance of his controversial statements are available for anyone to read. The challenges can be found on plenty of websites. The charges of heresy can be found on several websites as well.</p>
<p>However there is a disconnect. The Internet is the great liberator of minds. Being told what to think doesn&#8217;t really work anymore. Anyone can do their own research. In fact, R&#8217; Gordimer&#8217;s original article was using data that was a week old and required a simple click to verify if it was current. Obviously people called him on it. It&#8217;s so easy to do research today. We can verify and fact check and myth bust with ease. If a yeshiva student in the Mir circa 1967 wanted to read Biblical Criticism, where would he even go? But now, it&#8217;s all available. Google is a click away. People can read it for themselves. That was the thinking behind <a href="http://thetorah.com" target="_blank">TABS</a>. Provide a safe place to read Biblical Criticism in the context of orthodox Judaism. R&#8217; Farber was trying do that. Did he go too far? Is there such a thing as too far? These are the questions being addressed across the Internet right now.</p>
<p>The point is that drawing lines in the sand while expecting skeptics to just &#8220;listen&#8221; is so 1980s. It doesn&#8217;t work anymore. People can just look at the information and make their own determination. Perhaps many of these people are not qualified to make such judgments. But that doesn&#8217;t stop them.</p>
<p>While it is laudable that Cross-Currents is trying to address this issue, in my opinion they are not addressing it at all. Instead we are being told what to think without being told why. The only why we have heard is that if we think like R&#8217; Farber there will be dire consequences. Is that sufficient? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>The Internet is not going away. The questions that R&#8217; Farber addressed will be on the Internet forever. And there are more. The best defense I have seen so far is on TABS. The reason it is the best is because is simply because it is the only defense so far. We can lament the lack of scholars in the frum community willing to address these questions in the terms they are asked. But all we have to show for it are lamentations. Still no answers or explanations.</p>
<p>From the NY Times article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Mr. Mattsson said that when he started sharing what he had learned with other Mormons in Sweden, the stake president (who oversees a cluster of congregations) told him not to talk about it to any members, even his wife and children. He did not obey: “I said to them, why are you afraid for the truth?”</em></p>
<p>We say we have the truth. We should be trying to figure out how to reconcile it with other truths, not saying &#8220;we have the truth&#8221; so loudly that we are incapable of hearing anything else.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rabbi Louis Jacobs was an orthodox rabbi in the early 20th century. He was orthodox until he wasn&#8217;t. Professor Alan Brill chronicles the demise of Jacobs and how he diverged from prior orthodox positions and adopted liberal positions that were reserved for the non-orthodox.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate for orthodox Judaism that Jacobs and his contributions were lost to orthodox Judaism. I think we would be better off today had Jacobs toed the line and stayed within the bounds of orthodoxy. He was a great thinker and we nearly had the benefit of his thinking in orthodox Judaism.<span id="more-7368"></span></p>
<p>In short, Jacobs accepted elements of Biblical Criticism to the extent that his view could not be reconciled with any version of orthodox Judaism. According to Brill, Jacobs believed that much of the text of the Bible was not dictated to Moses. He believed that the origins of Judaism were not relevant rather the evolved Judaism of the 20th century was key. Eventually he went so far as to say that the Bible was written by humans.<img class="size-full wp-image-7369 alignright" alt="09jacobs_190" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/09jacobs_190.jpg" width="190" height="257" /></p>
<p>This placed him firmly outside the camp of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>But the real tragedy is what Brill says at the end of his post. Before Jacobs, orthodox Judaism had been developing an acceptable version of dealing with Biblical Criticism. Rabbis like Rabbi J.H. Hertz and Rabbi Isidore Epstein had previously acknowledged that while there was a revelation at Sinai, some parts of the Torah either predated Sinai and were including by incorporation or that some edits may have been made after Sinai. Their  views allowed some human element to the Bible.</p>
<p>The view of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein are significant. Both were orthodox rabbis and nevertheless were able to assert that there was a human element to the Bible.</p>
<p>However, Brill asserts that after Jacobs was ousted from orthodox Judaism for his newfound heretical views, the previously acceptable opinions of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein were given the pink slip as well. The approach to Biblical Criticism that developed in the wake of the Jacobs fiasco was so rigid that the somewhat flexible views of Rabbis Hertz and Epstein were no longer acceptable.</p>
<p>I think this is unfortunate. Orthodox Jews are expected to believe in the most rigid form of Torah M&#8217;Sinai. It is more rigid that the accepted beliefs of great orthodox rabbis from all across the timeline of Jewish history. Is it all because of Jacobs? Maybe. It certainly fits historically.</p>
<p>So while it is a shame that we lost Jacobs, in essence we have also lost Rabbis Hertz and Epstein. This is an even greater tragedy. They were orthodox and now their views are widely considered unorthodox.</p>
<p>But would it not be helpful to 2013 Judaism to allow their opinions back into the fold? I think it would. Absolute Torah M&#8217;Sinai can be a greater challenge than believing in God or in the power of Chazal to create obligation to contemporary orthodox Jews. Perhaps having a more flexible version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai that is consistent with historical orthodox Judaism would be of great use to frum skeptics everywhere.</p>

To be honest, when I read the interview I was unable to comprehend what she was trying to say. Only after a lengthy Facebook conversation and some posts by Gideon Slifkin did I get her approach, sort of.</p>
<p>Her words are very dense and quite cryptic but I think this what she is trying to say.</p>
<p>In her opinion, we have two immovable objects. We have Divine Revelation and the requisite belief that God gave the Torah to us in its complete form and we have Biblical Criticism which in her opinion asserts that the Torah has evolved from multiple authors and multiple eras. Something has to give. For most people, ignorance about one or the other is the turning point. People who know more about Biblical Criticism than TMS are more likely to think that the Torah is not Divine. Those who know more about (the Orthodox Jewish) approach to Torah than Biblical Criticism are more likely to think that Biblical Criticism is just a theory or soft science with more biases than religious approaches to Torah.</p>
<p>I am not here to take sides and apparently neither is Professor Ross.<span id="more-7233"></span></p>
<p>Ross&#8217;s basic idea is that &#8220;revelation&#8221; was not a one time thing. The revelation continues as the world progressed and however the Torah was emended or edited after Sinai was part of revelation. In order to make this sound religious, Professor Ross uses all kinds of fancy kabbalistic &#8220;logic&#8221; to make this approach kosher. In short, God is not bound by time so everything is really happening at once. Revelation can&#8217;t be just a moment in time and God is continually revealed through the evolution of Torah. Apparently there are allusions to this kind of theology in classical sources. Also, the thing that make our tradition unique is only that it is our tradition. I&#8217;m not sure how and why this fits in, but she does say it.</p>
<p>Read the entire interview because the bulk of it is really about what this approach is not as opposed to what this approach actually is. But what is it?</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not Orthodox. That&#8217;s for sure. But as has been pointed out, it&#8217;s not that far off. In terms of how the charedi world sees Mesorah and Daas Torah, the assumption is that God is &#8220;signing off&#8221; on the developments of Orthodox Judaism is part and parcel of how charedi Judaism works. So is it so hard to hear that God functioned the same way with regard to how the text of the Written Law evolved? Granted, the Written Law and Oral Law have different parameters and roles and I am not saying that these two ideas are the same. I am merely pointing out that the two ideas are similar.</p>
<p>Is this idea viable or useful?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. First of all, simple ideas are popular. There is a reason that more nuanced positions are less popular than bombastic theories of everything. People like when things are simple. The fundamentalist version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai is simple and not nuanced at all. It&#8217;s also pretty popular. If you want a theory to be popular it needs to be simple. Professor Ross has proposed a very complicated theory that is very difficult to articulate. It&#8217;s not going to gain much traction because of this fatal flaw.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think that an idea like this is not likely to help actual people. People who believe in the fundamentalist version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai don&#8217;t need this. People who reject Torah M&#8217;Sinai are not usually looking for creative way to believe in Torah M&#8217;Sinai. Further, I am not sure that this path will lead people who reject fundamentalist Torah M&#8217;Sinai to mitzvah observance. I think they want to do what God says to do, not what men say to do as a part of God&#8217;s slow revelation.</p>
<p>However, there are a few people in the middle who I am confident that this approach can help. Some people just want some theological basis to be orthodox and this can potentially serve that small group. If we believe in the primacy of keeping Torah and Mitzvos then we should welcome creative ways that are somewhat theologically sound to help more people accomplish this goal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Noahs-ark.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6339" title="Noah's ark" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Noahs-ark-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a>This week we read Parshas Noach. The focus of the parsha is the flood story. Most people are vaguely familiar with this story as it is told in the Bible.</p>
<p>God is disappointed in man, God decides to destroy mankind, God saves Noah by having Noah build a giant boat, Noah saves the animals in the boat, the rains come, the springs open up, the flood rages for 40 days and 40 nights, eventually the waters subside, Noah and his children settle back on dry land.</p>
<p>Moderns have three main issues with the flood narrative in the Bible. The first issue is the historicity of the event. The second issue is the confluence of deluge stories in other cultures, particular the Epic of Gilgamesh from the ancient Babylonians. The third issue is whether there are two flood narratives or just one.</p>
<p>Orthodox Jews rarely deal with these issues. The preferred method of handling these questions is to make a general statement about how the questions are flawed and then to change the subject.</p>
<p>However, the great Rabbi J.H. Hertz deals with these issues in his excellent Chumash. Everyone should have a copy. (Buy one here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0900689218/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0900689218&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank">Amazon</a>). Although he only speaks briefly and somewhat superficially on the subject, the fact that he makes the effort to discuss these issues is very admirable and unique. I don&#8217;t believe he sufficiently tackles the issues and puts them to rest, but I do think it is laudable that he tries. This post will deal with his approach to the first two questions and an apparent bombshell therein. Inquiring minds can research his approach to the third question on their own.<span id="more-6338"></span></p>
<p>R&#8217; Hertz assumes that there was a flood. This is not solely based on the Biblical narrative, as he also mentions the support of the science of his day in dating the flood to 3800 BCE. Today, science can show that there was no worldwide flood in 3800 BCE, but there is much evidence for <em>a flood </em>at <em>some prehistoric time</em>. This explains why almost every single ancient civilization has a flood story.</p>
<p>The way R&#8217; Hertz frames the comparison of the Bible&#8217;s flood story and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh" target="_blank">Epic of Gilgamesh</a> is very fascinating. He says the our forefather Jacob studied the ancient traditions of man in the Study halls of Shem and Ever. One of the things they studied was the ancient memory of a terrifying flood that caused &#8220;<em>a complete breach in the continuity of civilization in the primitive dwelling-place of mankind</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, R&#8217; Hertz compares it to the Babylonian tale. The similarities are uncanny. A great flood is doomed to destroy mankind, man and beast are saved in a boat, there is dove and then a raven sent to determine if the waters have subsided, and after leaving the ship the saved people bring sacrfices. He notes that the Biblical tale is far more hopeful and imparts an important moral lesson that the basis of humanity is justice and righteousness whereas the Babylonian tale is unethical, devoid of any morality. Specifically, Noah was saved because of his righteousness. The people were being punished for their evil sins. In contrast, the Babylonian tale tells the story of quarreling Gods who deceive one another and mankind. It is a story without moral value. Its primary purpose is to put fear in the hearts of the people. As much as the stories are similar, the differences tell the real story.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Hertz concludes with this incredibly difficult tightrope act:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In its Babylonian form, Assyriologists tell us, the story seems to have been reduced to writing as early as the days of Abraham. It must have been known in substance to the children of Israel in Cannaan and later in Egypt. But in the form in which, under God&#8217;s Providence, the Patriarchs transmitted it to the their descendants, it was free of degrading elements, and became an assertion of the everlasting righteousness of One God.</em></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t be certain, but this sounds to me like a borderline controversial statement. It sounds like he is saying that the Torah incorporates legends that were part of Jacob&#8217;s family lore in a specific way and in turn they become Torah. In other words, the story of flood need not be taken as a literal narrative that was told to Moses by God in a vacuum. Rather, the Jewish people knew this story, it carried a valuable lesson, and God incorporated it into the Torah.</p>
<p>I think this is a remarkable assertion and certainly outside the mainstream view in orthodox Judaism today. I guess my question is if is <em>should be </em>outside the mainstream orthodox view? I don&#8217;t think so. Currently, the modus operandi for handling delicate questions such as these is to retreat to the fundamentalist, maximalist position. It is going to become harder and harder to maintain those views. Perhaps the methodology used by R&#8217; Hertz is worth a  second glance.</p>
<p><em>(Thank you to Steg Belsky and Jacqueline Nichols for sending me images of the essays in the Hertz Chumash. Having recently moved, my copy seems to have gone missing, or been confiscated by the thought police).</em></p>
