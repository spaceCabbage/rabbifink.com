				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kosher Switch has been in development for several years. According to the inventor, the device replaces the standard light switch and through the magic of technology and Jewish law allows Shabbat observant Jews to switch their lights on and off. Last week, the company launched a campaign on Indiegogo to raise funds to satisfy minimum manufacturer requirements and begin production. The promotional video claims that leading rabbinic authorities approve the device for Shabbat use. In response, a proclamation signed by prominent American rabbinic authorities warned residents of Flatbush that the device was not kosher for Shabbat use and it should not be brought into one&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>A lot of the subsequent discussion has been somewhat juvenile. Questions about motive, credibility, and consistency have been raised in all directions and accusations of impropriety have been levied as well. To me, this is all just a distraction from the real issue here: <strong>Is the Kosher Switch Kosher? [Please show your work]</strong></p>
<p>Instead of delving into the religio-legal issues raised by the Kosher Switch, I find far too much of the discourse to be declarative and even in the rare case that arguments are made in favor or against the device, the articles read like persuasive briefs instead of dispassionate legal jurisprudence. I have read everything I could find and would like to present both sides of the issue as I see it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Needless to say, this discussion is for educational purposes only. If you are looking for a psak, ask a posek.</strong></em><span id="more-9185"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Prohibition</strong></p>
<p>I. Flipping a light switch on Shabbat might be a Biblical prohibition, but according to many opinions it might be a rabbinic prohibition.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9190" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/electricity-05.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="electricity-05" data-recalc-dims="1" /> If it is Biblical, one set of principles applies, and if it is rabbinic, another package of principles apply. Activating a circuit is presumed to be prohibited, but as has been noted, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to identify the actual prohibition. Lighting an incandescent bulb is the most likely candidate for Biblical prohibition due to the heating of the coils and the heat that it emits. But we live in a fluorescent world, and I think we can assume that the Kosher Switch is trying to solve a rabbinic problem as opposed to a Biblical problem.</p>
<p>II. The Torah forbids mindful acts of Shabbat desecration. Thus, there are several leniencies that can theoretically mitigate Biblical prohibition. When one performs an action that unwittingly causes a prohibited result it is permissible. This is called davar sh&#8217;eino mitkaven. But the leniency only applies as long as the unintended result was not inevitable, otherwise it is prohibited. This principle is called psik reisha, and the action is Biblically prohibited. However, if the unintended result of the action is undesirable it is called a psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei and it is not Biblically prohibited. There is a dispute among the Medieval commentators whether a psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei is still rabbinically prohibited or if it is permissible.</p>
<p>III. There is a secondary dispute among the late Medieval and Renaissance commentators when a psik reisha only produces a rabbinically prohibited result. Some say it is still prohibited rabbinically, and others say it is completely permissible. Even those who prohibit in these cases may allow psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei. Some prohibit even in such cases, and others only allow under certain conditions.</p>
<p>IV. When it&#8217;s unknown if the psik reisha resulted in a prohibition it is called a safeik psik reisha. One late Renaissance opinion holds this would not even be considered a psik reisha, and is not prohibited at all. One Contemporary authority rules that safeik psik reisha is permissible when the result is rabbinically prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Proximate Cause</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Indirectly causing a prohibited result is called grama. The Talmud offers two seemingly contradictory positions on grama. One is permitted to place vessels filled with water in the path of a fire. The fire will be extinguished by the water in the vessels, and extinguishing fire is normally prohibited. The Talmud explains that this is a permissible case of grama. However, the Talmud also prohibits tossing wheat with its chaff into the wind to separate the kernel from the chaff, even though that appears to be a grama as well. Several narrowing definitions of grama have been proposed to reconcile this issue.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>When there is a time lapse between the action and the result it is considered a grama. It will take some time for the water to be released from the vessels but the chaff will be removed from the wheat almost immediately.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is only when the indirect cause is the normal manner in which the result is achieved. Normally, one would not extinguish a fire by placing vessels of water in its path, but one <em>would</em> toss wheat in the air to winnow.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is only when the person completes the indirect act, and an intervening act is still needed to cause the prohibited result. The water is trapped in vessels that are a distance away from the fire, so the fire must travel and burst the vessels.  In the case of the wheat, the wind is <em>already</em> blowing when one throws the wheat in the air.</li>
<li>Or perhaps grama is only when the prohibited result is not inevitable. There is no guarantee that the fire will be extinguished by the water in the vessels but it&#8217;s certain that the wind will remove some chaff from the wheat.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Grama is not a blanket permission. The general consensus is that grama is only allowed in cases of great need. Some Modern and Contemporary authorities hold that grama would also be permissible when the result is not desired.</li>
<li>One Contemporary rabbinic authority holds that oneg Shabbat (pleasure of Shabbat) is considered a great need.   <strong><br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Not Even a Grama</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>The foremost Renaissance halachic authority for Ashkenazi Jewry says one can leave a candle near a door if the wind is not blowing, even if the wind will eventually blow. He also holds that grama is only permissible in cases of financial loss, and since here he makes no such stipulation, it can be assumed that he holds this is not even a case of grama.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is when the other contributing factor causing the prohibition exists. But where the wind is not blowing, the thing that is needed to complete the act does not even exist at the time of human act.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is when the human act is <em>connected</em> to the thing that will complete the prohibited act. The human is only opening a door to let the wind blow. The wind is the thing doing the extinguishing and the act is not connected to the wind.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Kosher Switch</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Basically, two things are happening inside the Kosher Switch. First, there is an emitter and a receiver that complete a circuit. When the emitter and receiver are active, the circuit is complete and the light is on. The second component is a barrier that creates a blockage between emitter and receiver when the switch is flipped.</li>
<li>When the light is on, the emitter and receiver cycle through sleep and active periods and an indicator will tell the user when they are asleep. The user will move the barrier by flipping the switch, and at a random time, the emitter will try to connect to the receiver. If it cannot connect, the circuit will be disrupted and the light will turn off. When the emitter and receiver are sleeping, an indicator tells the user it&#8217;s safe to move the switch. If the barrier is moved, the emitter and receiver will communicate at a random time and will attempt to complete the circuit. Even when the barrier is removed, the emitter and receiver do not automatically connect. They both randomly generate codes that must &#8220;match&#8221; in order to complete the circuit. After each failed attempt, the emitter will try connected again at a random time. If the barrier has not been moved, the emitter will not see the receiver and the light will remain off.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Show Your Work</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Flipping the Kosher Switch does not directly turn the lights on or off.<img class="alignright wp-image-9188 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/KosherSwitch1.jpg?resize=449%2C600" alt="KosherSwitch1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></li>
<li>Assuming it is considered a psik reisha, the result is a rabbinically prohibited act. This is permissible according to some authorities.</li>
<li>Assuming a psik reisha that produces a rabinically prohibited act is still prohibited, the act of flipping the switch might be a safeik psik reisha. This is permissible according to some authorities.</li>
<li>It might be a grama because there is a time lapse between the switch flip and the circuit completing.</li>
<li>It might be a grama because an intervening act, by the emitter and receiver, is needed to complete the circuit.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s possible that it could be a grama because the Kosher Switch is not the normal manner one turns on a light. Maybe.</li>
<li>If the light is considered oneg Shabbat, grama plus a &#8220;great need&#8221; would render the switch permissible according to some.</li>
<li>It might not be a grama at all, because the current is totally dead at the time of the act. Non-grama is certainly permissible.</li>
<li>Or it might not be grama at all because the human act is not connected to the emitter and receiver. The human act only connects to the switch and barrier.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Objections</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Rabbi Rozen says: &#8220;Even if they added to the ‘Grama’ additional apparatuses, and even if there is a one in a thousand chance that the action will not occur, I have received from my rabbis (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and R. Shaul Yisraeli) that this does not change in any way the halakhic status of regular ‘grama’ (just like grama D’grama and other artificial arrangements).&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Rozen says: &#8220;Even if the method of operation is non-active from the point of view of the agent, i.e. because he merely removes the “preventing element,” Rabbi S. Z. Auerbach and others wrote that this remains forbidden and is treated like it was done directly by the person, since the action occurs immediately after the human intervention/action. Even if the result comes only after a delay caused by an additional factor, this is plain grama, which is still not permitted L’chatchila.&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Student argues that the Kosher Switch is only a grama according to some opinions and even a grama is not permissible ab initio.</li>
<li>Rabbi Tzvi Ortner says: &#8220;We must question whether a case can be built for permissibility based on what the Gemara does not say. That is, the fact that the Gemara does not speak of the halacha of something that has not entered the world does not prove that this case is less than a grama. Perhaps this case is deemed a grama too!&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Tzvi Ortner says: &#8220;Even should this logic be sound, one can hardly call the pulses “not in this world,” since the switch is designed for the function to turn on intermittently. It is an absolute certainty that the force will come back into existence, and this is by design. Even if we could find a case of wind that is not “in this world” that is permissible, this is only because the effect is not under man’s control, which thus “distances” his action from the eventual force (see Magen Avraham 328:53). However, the pulses in the Kosher Switch are designed and controlled by man to arrive with continuity, and thus bear no comparison to the case of the wind, which is beyond his control.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Possible Responses</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Okay, but there is precedent for &#8220;not even grama&#8221; under similar circumstances. Not everyone has to agree with what you received from your rabbis.</li>
<li>Right, but this is a switch that is delayed and also dependent on random emitter and receiver contact which could have legal implications according to some precedents. Further, even if it is a grama, it could be combined with oneg Shabbat to establish a &#8220;great need.&#8221;</li>
<li>There is a solid argument, with precedent, to say that it is not even grama. And again, even if it is grama it might be okay.</li>
<li>The Talmud doesn&#8217;t say it, but the foremost Renaissance rabbinic authority seems to hold this way.</li>
<li>Sure, this is possible. But so is the alternative proposed by Kosher Switch proponents. It might be different than the wind, but it might be similar as well.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So there you have it. A legitimate discussion about Kosher Switch from a religio-legal perspective.</p>
<p>It seems like two things might be happening here. It&#8217;s possible that the opponents of the Kosher Switch did not read through the responsa on the Kosher Switch website. All their questions are covered in their materials. But I think there is something deeper happening here as well. I have a feeling that the Kosher Switch proponents are using a different paradigm than the opponents.</p>
<p>The opponents seem to hold that in order for something to be permissible it needs to work according to all established rabbinic authorities. The Kosher Switch certainly does not meet that bar. Kosher Switch proponents hold that in order for something to be prohibited it needs to not work according to all established rabbinic authorities. Unfortunately, both sides seem to believe that their approach is the only correct approach so they do not acknowledge the validity of their opponents.</p>
<p>This represents a huge gap between two acceptable ways to look at halacha. I do think that the idea that we should try to satisfy all halachic precedent has some roots in the Talmud. But the importance and universal emphasis we give to this idea is somewhat a new innovation. It&#8217;s prominent in the Mishna Berura, a 20th century compilation and commentary on one section of the Code of Jewish Law. The Chofetz Chaim seems to have attempted to select and codify the halachic opinions that were most universally held. Today, the idea is very prominent in Brisk and its progeny. The hallmark of this approach is its lack of self confidence and self reliance. We are nervous that we are not doing it right so we try to fulfill as many positions as possible because one of them has got to be right.</p>
<p>We also have a tradition of &#8220;koach d&#8217;hetera adif&#8221; &#8211; the power to permit is great, and the concept of &#8220;limud zechus&#8221; &#8211; trying to find any halachic path to justify questionable behavior. The Aruch HaShulchan, by Rav Yechiel Michel Epstein, an exhaustive restatement of Jewish law written in the late 19th century, is known for its efforts on this side of the halachic coin. Rabbi Epstein tried to be machria and choose a path but he presented a potpourri of acceptable opinions in every section. It seems that this tradition is less prominent in our society. The hallmark of this approach is autonomy and courage. We try to research a topic as best we can, and attempt to forge a personal path that rings true to our genuinely held religious convictions.</p>
<p>I do harbor some concerns that our preference for the former over the latter is having a net negative impact on 21st century Orthodox Judaism. A society that looks for stringencies and looks down upon those with a different approach to Jewish law can become extremely uncomfortable for its non-conformist constituents. Autonomy and self confidence are authentic Torah values too. We ignore them at our peril.</p>
<p>This dispute might be a case study of this dichotomy or I might be completely off the mark, but either way, researching this topic inspired this idea in me. I believe there is a valid halachic path that permits the Shabbos Switch. I also acknowledge that this path will not be universally held. I think that&#8217;s okay. Variety and diversity can be good things. Let&#8217;s try to bring a little more of that back into our world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Shabbos App was introduced to the world this week. A lot of people think it&#8217;s a hoax. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s very, very real.</p>
<p>Several people asked me what I thought about the app and I wanted to speak with someone at the Shabbos App before I wrote anything. I had a nice conversation with one of the people working on the app and feel comfortable writing about the app, their ambitions, and the consequences.</p>
<p>Almost everyone working on the app is Shomer Shabbos. This is not a subversive attempt to ruin Shabbat or pull people away from Orthodox Judaism. Rather, the app is for Orthodox Jews who want to observe Shabbat <em>and</em> use their smartphones. The developers spent considerable time and effort researching halachic reasoning and opinions on the subject. They know what they are doing and what they are up against.<span id="more-8857"></span></p>
<p><em>I am not an expert on these matters.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/01/the-shabbos-app-yes-it-is-real/halfshabbos1-635x355/" rel="attachment wp-att-8858"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8858" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/halfshabbos1-635x355.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="halfshabbos1-635x355" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> I have studied them several times in various forums, so I am familiar with the general principles and arguments. <strong>Do not rely on anything I say here.</strong></em></p>
<p>Briefly, the issue of electricity on Shabbat is not simple. Every Orthodox Jew knows that it&#8217;s prohibited. Many know about the psak of the Chazon Ish who prohibited electricity based on the <em>melacha</em> (Biblically forbidden creative activity) of <em>boneh</em> (building) because activating an electric device involves completing a circuit which is a form of building. Many people also know that this is not considered an accurate description of electricity or boneh by Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. Rabbi Auerbach famously concluded that although there is no particular forbidden labor that precludes use of electricity per se; it is forbidden because that has become the accepted halachic tradition in Orthodox Judaism. At most, this would be a Rabbinic prohibition.</p>
<p>This rule applies to electricity in general. There are electrical devices that can violate possible Biblical prohibitions. Using a microwave might be bishul, or lighting an incandescent bulb might be <em>mav&#8217;ir</em>. Smartphones raise another set of issues which are particular to modern personal electronics. I don&#8217;t think any of these would be Biblical prohibitions either. The greatest obstacle is probably<em> tikun maneh</em> or <em>makeh b&#8217;patish</em>, but these issues have already been handled with regard to electrical appliances that use a Sabbath (really Yom Tov) Mode. Once again, the Shabbos App team is comfortable navigating these areas of halacha. The problems raised by draining battery, writing, lighting the screen, generating sounds, and charging can be circumvented with technological workarounds. The Shabbos App does all this by running in the background of the smartphone and controlling those problem areas in a way that prevents the issues. Apparently, the Android OS is more flexible in this regard and thus presents a more robust solution. But even in Apple iOS, the app is functional and would potentially avoid all violations of Rabbinic prohibitions.</p>
<p>So it is real. And it actually does what they say it does. At least in terms of the technical aspects of halacha, it seems to avoid violating Shabbat prohibitions according to accepted halachic opinions.</p>
<p>The motivations of the Shabbos App team are genuine and holy. There are people who use smartphones on Shabbat right now. The way they use them is more likely to incur serious halachic problems. As a consequence, those who use them often feel very guilty.  Not to say that they shouldn&#8217;t feel this way, but guilt can morph into a form of religious self-loathing that triggers further departures from observance in other areas. This is a terrible result. The Shabbos App might assuage some of that guilt and keep more people in the fold. They might be right about that too. I am also very sympathetic to the emotional needs of people struggling with observance and I can corroborate the guilt slicked journey off the path. I am not expressing an opinion on the importance of this effort, or whether it outweighs considerations in the other direction. But it&#8217;s a valid concern. Further, if it is permissible to use a smartphone in this manner, then maybe they actually should be used.</p>
<p>So far, the objections to the app carry a familiar tune. In essence, the problem with the Shabbos App is that even if it is halachically acceptable, it will ruin the spirit of Shabbat. I am sympathetic to this point of view as well. There is something beautiful about avoiding technology on Shabbat. Recently I advocated using the digital fast concept as a social benefit to keeping Shabbat on this blog. I think it might be worth turning off our devices for Shabbat even if devices were permissible. However, Rabbi Heinemann addressed this concern when similar objections were raised against his Sabbath Mode ovens. His response was that if something is permissible then it can&#8217;t ruin the spirit of Shabbat. There&#8217;s no such thing. He supported his position by noting that when the Aruch HaShulchan or Rabbi Auerbach permitted the use of telephones on Shabbat the spirit of Shabbat was not a concern. Further, when they backtracked and prohibited the use of phones on Shabbat, they did not hang their hats on the spirit of Shabbat. Telephones were prohibited based on halachic concerns, not spirit of Shabbat concerns. When I asked the Shabbos App developer what Shabbat would look like if everyone would be using their smartphones, his answer reflected this sensibility. He said <em>&#8220;Shabbat will look the way Hashem wants it to look!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>What&#8217;s going to happen when the app is released? Almost all Orthodox rabbis will prohibit it. That&#8217;s almost a near certainty. But what will the people do? Most adults will listen to their rabbis. I suspect that younger demographics might consider the Shabbos App. If they do, they will probably need to hide their smartphone use. I can&#8217;t see Orthodox Judaism adopting the app and its halachic implications en masse in the near future. But it is possible that as we become more and more dependent on technology, especially passive technology, there will be a natural movement toward greater leniency. If that does happen, I think we might look back on the Shabbat App and see it as a catalyst for that change. In the meantime, I don&#8217;t expect any significant change in the way Orthodox Jews think about smartphones, but at the very least we will be forced to talk about these issues with more halachic rigor and discussion. That is definitely a good thing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My go-to halachic source is the Aruch HaShulchan written by Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein. His son was Rabbi Baruch Epstein, the author of the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/torah-temimah/" target="_blank">Torah Temimah</a>. I love both of their works. The Aruch HaShulchan is remarkable because it cites several opinions for many laws as it goes into a bit of detail for each section of law. It&#8217;s not just the law, rather it also include backgournd, dissenting opinions, and discussion. But my favorite part of the Aruch HaShulchan is where it goes off script and either preaches to its readers or provides fascinating social and historical data.</p>
<p>I try to review the relevant laws as we travel through the the yearly cycle to refresh my memory. Looking through the laws that apply from Shiva Asar B&#8217;Tamuz through Tisha B&#8217;Av, I noticed several very interesting things of note. Here I present three:<span id="more-8656"></span></p>
<p><strong>Not Eating Meat or Drinking Wine for 8 Days</strong></p>
<p>The accepted Ashkenazi practice is not to eat meat or poultry from Rosh Chodesh Av through Tisha B&#8217;Av excluding Shabbat. The primary reason for this custom is that we don&#8217;t want to eat the kind of food that was consumed in the temple during the week we begin to mourn for its destruction. In modern society, this is considered quite arduous and grown men have been known to complain that they can&#8217;t handle not eating meat or poultry for so long. But apparently this is a longstanding custom.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/04/three-thoughtful-things-aruch-hashulchan-shiva-asar-btamuz-tisha-bav/epstein-r-yechiel-michel-aruch-hashulchan/" rel="attachment wp-att-8657"><img class="alignright  wp-image-8657" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Epstein-R-Yechiel-Michel-Aruch-HaShulchan.gif?resize=361%2C518" alt="Epstein, R' Yechiel Michel - Aruch HaShulchan" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It seems that people in 19th century Lithuania complained at least as much as we do. Additionally, people would artificially create Siyum scenarios to permit the eating of meat to lessen the terrible strain of meat deprivation. But the Aruch HaShulchan finds this abhorrent. He says that making a Siyum in this manner is &#8220;<em>meguneh&#8221;</em> &#8211; disgusting, see below. There were some people who just ignored the law and ate meat anyway. The Aruch HaShulchan calls these people out and asks rhetorically how they are not embarrassed and ashamed to violate this law for the sake of eating meat?!</p>
<p>But then he says something that surprised me. The Aruch HaShulchan says that Jews should stop complaining about not eating meat and drinking wine. It&#8217;s not such a big deal. Furthermore, the non-Jews (Catholics) refrain from eating meat and fish for weeks and if they can do it, we can do it! We are the Chosen People, stop <em>kvetching </em>so much!</p>
<p>Clearly, he is talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent" target="_blank">Lent</a>. I think it&#8217;s awesome that he knew about Lent. I think it&#8217;s even more awesome that he referenced it in his halacha book. And I find myself very skeptical that it would be acceptable to refer to Lent in a book of Jewish law, today</p>
<p><strong>On Siyumim</strong></p>
<p>In general, the Aruch HaShulchan prefers that we just not eat meat for 8 extra days.  One cannot eat meat at a Siyum unless he would have gone to the Siyum during the rest of the year. One cannot wait a few days to make a Siyum so that their Siyum is in the 9 days. But one may start learning a tractate simply in order to make a Siyum because that just helps increase Torah study.</p>
<p>But what should one do? Should one make the Siyum in the 9 days if one fortuitously completes a tractate in the 9 days?</p>
<p>The Aruch HaShulchan says that the custom in his city was actually to wait until after the 9 days to make the Siyum and forgo the culinary benefits of a 9 days Siyum. His reasoning is that the best way to celebrate a Siyum would be in a time on the calendar without any sadness or happiness restriction. So if you want to maximize your Siyum celebration, obviously you would wait until after the 9 days. So that&#8217;s what they did. What a beautiful perspective on Torah and a Torah lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Litvaks in Streimels</strong></p>
<p>The context is a bit complicated and completely irrelevant to the small point that I want to make here. All of us associate striemels with Hasidic Jews. The Aruch HaShulchan mentions that in his decidedly non-hasidic town, the people wore shtreimels. So first of all, clearly shtreimels were not a Hasidic garb, they were just a garb.</p>
<p>At some point, the Litvaks stopped wearing shtreimels. The Aruch HaShulchan explains that the government forbade them from wearing shtreimels so they started wearing different hats.</p>
<p>I have no idea if this is historically accurate. But regardless, this is an interesting nugget. I hope it can corroborated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there you have it. Three thoughtful things for the 9 Days.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This began as a Facebook post, but it turned into something substantial enough for a blog post. This week is Schlissel Challah week. For several years I have questioned the virtue of this custom by posting criticism of the practice, suggesting that it has pagan roots, or made jokes about baking keys into bread for money. In doing so I seem to have created a caricature that does not even remotely resemble my actual position on this issue (and a few others).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my actual opinion on Schlissel Challah (as opposed to quoting R&#8217; Schachter or posting irreverent memes):<span id="more-8350"></span></p>
<p>You want to bake a key in your bread and use it as a way to connect to God? Go for it. You want to be cool with religious traditions that are subjectively meaningful and clearly manmade? Amen. You want to introduce new rituals into Judaism and call that Orthodox? I&#8217;m with you.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8351" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/shutterstock_19456234.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="shutterstock_19456234" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>All I ask is that you acknowledge what you are doing. See, R&#8217; Schachter (and to his credit, Daniel Oppenheimer) is super consistent. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10102293494909645?__mref=message_bubble" target="_blank">He is against Schlissel Challah</a> and he is equally against modern innovations shaped by liberal ideals. I can deal with that.</p>
<p>The problem is when we elevate Schlissel Challah, Tu B&#8217;Shvat Seders, Hillula d&#8217;Rashby, upsherin, and even Simanim on Rosh Hashana, into hallowed rituals that are treated as the word of God while at the same time insisting that Orthodoxy does not change. Then, to make things worse, when other innovations that we don&#8217;t like start to creep into Orthodox Judaism, we become strict traditionalists and we claim that everything in Orthodox Judaism is the same as it ever was and manmade rituals are really the Word of God.</p>
<p>So my purpose in discussing the criticism and folly of some of these traditions is to demonstrate that they also had to leap theological and religious hurdles. Yet, they are mainstream now and to question their validity is sacrosanct.</p>
<p>I welcome an Orthodox Judaism that is comfortable adapting and adopting from wherever. That&#8217;s the kind of Judaism I believe in. I actually don&#8217;t agree with R&#8217; Schachter on this issue. I think there is a legitimate version of Orthodox Judaism that is more flexible than R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s. But the greatest challenge to that Judaism is the willful blindness about the external forces and ideas that influence contemporary Orthodox Judaism. Spinning the Partnership Minyanim or Yoatzot of yesteryear, like Schlissel Challah or Lag B&#8217;Omer, from questionable innovations into obligation hurts the cause.</p>
<p>Instead, the approach should be that Judaism absorbs foreign things into its culture all the time. They are subjective and work for some people and don&#8217;t work for others. Those things continue to evolve and are voluntary. In the same vein, we should embrace other subjective innovations that work for some people but don&#8217;t work for others as long as they can be justified within a valid halachic context. Not everyone has to like them and not everyone has to think that every halachic authority would approve. But it&#8217;s wrong to freeze Orthodox Judaism in 1875. There is no frozen date for manmade innovation. If Judaism had been truly frozen in 250 or 1250, or 1520, many of our most cherished and celebrated traditions would have been jettisoned long before they reached broad appeal.</p>
<p>The myth that every tradition we have goes back to Sinai, and that they all came from God, and that all our customs today were never criticized or questioned when they were introduced, is a destructive and cannibalistic lie. But more than the pain of being told a lie and the pain of discovering the lie, is the insistence that there is no lie.</p>
<p>Own it. Acknowledge it. Things change in Orthodox Judaism. The factors that transition something from fringe to mainstream are not articulable nor do they follow a set of rules. And that is okay. We are comfortable admitting it. When new innovations (that can be justified in halacha) are proposed, don&#8217;t say Orthodox Judaism doesn&#8217;t change. Don&#8217;t say it doesn&#8217;t change unless it fits a subjective, easily debunked formula. Say, &#8220;my subjective preference is that this innovation not be adopted because of [insert subjective reason].&#8221; I think this approach can be the <em>key </em>that can unlock a new conversation and provide a viable path toward an evolving future.</p>
<p>Enjoy your Challah, key or keyless.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to inspiration, most Orthodox Jews turn to glorious books of Mussar, or historical legends about our Torah sages, or fiery speeches by modern day orators, or the latest Aish.com inspirational story, or other Torah content that is heavy on encouragement or equally overloaded with deprecation. When it comes to Jewish law, we study Halachic texts. We don’t expect to find inspiration in legal works.</p>
<p>But Halachic text can be inspirational too. For example, Aruch Hashulchan, Orach Chaim §484.</p>
<p>The original text of OC §484<a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Arbaah_Turim.1.484.1" target="_blank">in the Tur</a> and <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.484" target="_blank">Shulchan Aruch</a> dryly discusses the codification of the Rif regarding the procedure for one who is, for some unknown reason, making blessings of the Seder in more than one home. It&#8217;s fairly straightforward and uninteresting. This is standard Talmudic and post-Talmudic legalism. Conjure up an obscure situation and use it as a test case to demonstrate the limits of the law. In this case, the laws that dictate how and where one must eat their Seder meal and perform the Seder rituals. The practical law is not relevant to the point of this article.<span id="more-8318"></span></p>
<p>Interestingly, in his halachic work, R’ Epstein pretty much invents (unless he gets it from another source that I have not been able to find) the circumstances of this quirky law. The <a href="http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/ערוך_השולחן_אורח_חיים_תפד" target="_blank">Aruch Hashulchan, OC §484</a> begins this section with this introduction: <span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><em>&#8220;One who has neighbors who don&#8217;t know how to make the blessings and perform the Seder rituals, and he has no choice but to make a Seder for his neighbors, should perform the Seder on their behalf in the following manner.</em>” </span><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Later he says, that if the neighbors can’t read Hebrew he should recite the blessings with his neighbors word by word. He references this idea of teaching his neighbors how to do the Seder several times throughout the section. And not just at one home. The law is speaking about an individual who is going from home to home to home in order to help all his neighbors make a proper Seder. Thus, the dry law found in the Tur and Shulchan Aruch is not merely an abstract construction designed to test the limits of the law. In fact, the law is relevant to a very practical and possibly common situation. The chapter is about a Good Samaritan who abandons his own Seder for the sake of his neighbors who don’t know how to do a Seder on their own.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vienna-haggadah-1930-after-xl-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8320" alt="vienna-haggadah-1930-after-xl-2" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/vienna-haggadah-1930-after-xl-2.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p>I can’t help but feel a surge of love and pride for R’ Epstein and his imaginary, but surely very real, hero of this section of halacha. This man is incredible. Of course he does his own Seder. And of course he does it well. When he proclaims at his Seder that “All who want to partake may come and join us,” no one comes. But he knows that his neighbors are clueless as to how to make a Seder. He knows that they are not enjoying their own Seders. So he finishes his Seder in a timely manner, leaves the comfort of his home, and gets to work on assisting as many people as he can in the great Mitzvah of reliving the Exodus via the Seder. He is a giant of Jewish spirit.</p>
<p>Late 19th century <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navahrudak" target="_blank">Belarus</a> had many pious, practicing Jews. But apparently, many were apathetic or simply ignorant of the Seder traditions. (Yes, even in the shtetl, there was &#8220;Social Orthodoxy&#8221; and religious greenhorns.) Would these people be able to make a Seder on their own? Certainly not. So would they just miss the entire Seder process? R&#8217; Epstein would not stand for that. It was either assumed that more educated neighbors would obviously be out all Seder night helping their neighbors who needed a Seder, or perhaps R’ Epstein was making an oblique suggestion that people should get out and help their neighbors. It’s a grand view of the role of the practicing Jew and R’ Epstein almost demands that this be our approach to the non-practicing Jew. Reaching out to others is expected.</p>
<p>I was inspired by this chapter of Aruch Hashulchan. I was inspired by the clever reframing of an obscure legalistic exercise into a spectacular practical lesson in caring for our fellow Jew. Fortunately, it seems we have embodied this monumental lesson into our modern Pesach Seders. So many people host Seders with incredibly diverse groups of their Jewish brothers and sisters. The level of education and familiarity with the rituals ranges from expert to novice. But all are included. An emphasis on Jewish education and modern technology gives us all easy access to attaining familiarity with the Seder and its traditions. We can all assist others and help them participate in a Seder.</p>
<p>Let’s do our best to make sure that there is no one who needs to look up the laws of §484 this year. Make sure that everyone has a Seder to attend. There’s also enough time to learn about the Seder in time for Monday night’s big event. All the Jewish people experienced the exodus and tasted freedom together. The Seder belongs to all of us. Take ownership and share the joy of the Seder freely and generously.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recently <a href="http://5tjt.com/the-forgotten-method-of-eating-matzah/" target="_blank">published article in the 5 Towns Jewish Times</a> provides its readers with instructions on how to eat matzah at the Seder. It seems as though the rabbi writing the article is trying to educate his readers who are not aware of the “true laws” of matzah eating. An imaginary dialogue that precedes the legal analysis implies that this is the “true” way to eat matzah and that no one knows about it. Further, the next paragraph argues that one who truly loves God will do the mitzvah in the manner that satisfies the greatest number of Rishonim and we are to presume that what follows this introduction fits this description.</p>
<p>The most novel law in the article is that according to the author, the Shulchan Aruch holds that one is obligated to eat the two “olive measures” of matzah simultaneously all in one swallow. The size of this amount of matzah is up for debate. The author suggests abiding by the opinion that an olive measure is 1/4 of a round hand matzah. Thus, one would be obligated to swallow 1/2 of a round hand matzah at one time. Obviously this is a very difficult task. It would require some sort of eating system that stores a ever growing ball of chewed matzah on one side of one’s mouth while adding more and more unchewed matzah into one’s mouth until the full measure has been chewed. Then one swallows the entire mass intact. Not only is this extremely difficult, it seems to be quite impolite and unseemly in respectable company. But according to the author of the article this is what we must do.<span id="more-8300"></span></p>
<p>But the law is not so simple. The size of an olive measure is subject to much debate and discussion. There are reliable authorities who say an olive measure is the size of a flattened olive which is around the size of a credit card. On the other side of the spectrum are those who say an olive measure is about 2/3 of a square matzah. The two olive measures that one must eat at the Seder are not the same. One is a Torah obligation and the other is Rabbinic. So while one should be stringent for the Torah measurement, one may be lenient for the Rabbinic measurement. The author of the article does not mention this distinction. So one could walk away from the article and think that the obligation is to eat up to 1 and 1/3 square matzahs in one swallow. But this is certainly not the law. The second olive measure may be a lenient measure and since the largest size of an olive measure is actually more than double the most lenient measure, just the one stringent measure is actually enough for both according to some authorities. (Rabbi Heinemann)<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/round-matzah.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8301" alt="round-matzah" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/round-matzah.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>More importantly, whatever the amount, the author assumes that one is in fact obligated according to the Shulchan Aruch to eat both olive measures in one swallow. Students of Brisk are careful to follow this rule. (That’s how I knew about it before reading the article.) But by no means is this the only reading of the Shulchan Aruch. In fact, the author even mentions that the Mishneh Berurah and Magen Avraham do not read the Shulchan Aruch in this manner. Rather, they say that one is only obligated to have both olive measures in one’s mouth at the same time and swallowing can be done in two parts, one for each olive measure. This method is actually the author’s recommendation. The most lenient opinion on this issue mentioned in the article is the Terumas HaDeshen who says that one may ingest each olive measures in two or three swallows if one is “unable” to swallow an entire olive measure in one shot.</p>
<p>The problem is that the Mishneh Berurah is not the only opinion worthy of consideration here. The Chazon Ish and Steipler Gaon ate their matzah in the normal manner.(Cited in Orchos Rabbeinu) They did not follow the suggestion of the author of the article and attempt to swallow giant balls of chewed up matzah. The Aruch Hashulchan (475:4-5) unequivocally permits eating matzah normally, as long as one does not make a hefsek. He bases this on the fact that the Shulchan Aruch invented this entire law without any Rishonim to support his ruling. Further, the Maharil (14th century Rishon) explicitly writes that one may eat the matzah slowly with no requirement to swallow the whole measure at once.</p>
<p>This might explain why people don’t really know about the obscure and extremely challenging method described in the Shulchan Aruch. There are serious authorities who hold differently. (It also could be that the Shulchan Aruch assumed people would be eating soft matzah which might be easier to pull off his rather demanding version of fulfilling the mitzvah.)</p>
<p>I am concerned about the implications of publicizing and lightheartedly shaming people into adhering to the much more strict opinion of the Shulchan Aruch. The Torah commands us to eat matzah. When the Torah says that we should eat matzah, it means that we should eat matzah. Doing it the way the Shulchan Aruch would have us do it is not eating. It’s jumping through a complicated halachic hoop to earn a reward. It seems impossible to feel like one is eating if one trying to form and then swallow a giant ball of chewed up matzah. Eating in this manner almost dehumanizes the act of eating matzah and turns it into a purely mechanical robotic hologram of eating.</p>
<p>The view of halacha that advocates this kind of observance in 2014 seems to be connected to a worldview of magical thinking and superstition. In this view, our obligations are obscure, odd, difficult rituals with only a tenuous connection to reality. The author of the Shulchan Aruch, Rabbi Yosef Karo lived that kind of life. He was a mystic. But that is not how many others view halacha, nor is it the vision of halacha that I think works best in 2014. This other version of mitzvah observance emphasizes that our rituals and religious activities are part of our very human lives and they infuse the mundane with spirit and soul. We eat like everyone else, yet we eat differently. But it looks like the eating of everyone else. The difference is internal. When we experience that kind of Torah, we influence the entirety of our life. It’s part of us. It is accessible. It is planted on <em>terra firma</em>, with lofty aspirations toward the heavens. This down to earth approach works well with the halachic opinions that advocate for eating matzah the way normal people eat.</p>
<p>In general, I think that a Torah life should be one that speaks to the everyday things that normal people do. Torah life does not require transcendence. In fact, it’s explicit in the Talmud that the Torah was not given the Angels. It was given to humans. People. People who eat matzah the way they eat everything else, just with a completely different intent that transforms the experience from normal eating to mitzah eating. This is the essence of being a Jew. The Exodus gave us the freedom needed to be human. Then, as free people, we were given the Torah.</p>
<p>There is a danger of getting lost in the technical requirements of halacha. We must follow the law, but we must not allow the law to become everything. The Seder can be a magical time. But the magic comes from the experience of the Seder, not Olympics caliber eating performances. Don’t allow the legal technicalities swallow the joy and spirit of the Seder. Make sure your Seder is a place where halacha is the skeleton, but the heart, the flesh of the evening is reliving the Exodus with your family. Try not to get swept into side discussions about obscure laws or technicalities. Focus your Seder on living the ingenious construction of Chazal that integrates sight, smell, taste, action, and speech into a visceral experience that carries us from Nirtzah to the next Kadesh 12 months later.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.torahmusings.com/2014/03/may-orthodox-rabbis-permit-women-to-don-tefillin/" target="_blank">Rabbi Mayer Twersky published</a> a very strong elaboration of Rabbi Schachter&#8217;s very strong halachic proclamation about women wearing tefillin. Rabbi Schachter&#8217;s opinion is that it is prohibited for women to wear tefillin and it is hubris for lower level rabbis to think that they can permit that which is prohibited by the greater Torah scholars. In his article, Rabbi Twersky explains the philosophical underpinnings of Rabbi Schachter&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>The article is very clear and unequivocally reiterates the prohibition from a halachic perspective. In short, the Rama is the law and unless someone with huge shoulders <em>paskens</em> that we can hold differently than the Rama, the law remains like the Rama.</p>
<p>In addition to the halachic analysis, Rabbi Twersky makes a social argument. In essence, he argues that the reason some rabbis would like to permit women to wear tefillin is because there is a modern trend toward equality of the genders.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Egalitarianism rejects a vital, essential, divinely ordained dimension of Halachah. Halachah does not discriminate against men or women. Most assuredly, however, it distinguishes between the genders. A genuine commitment to authentic Halachah per force entails rejecting the socially dominant, false philosophy of egalitarianism.&#8221;</em><span id="more-8257"></span></p>
<p>The basic reasoning is that there is an intrinsic value system in the Torah and the Torah cannot adjust or be modified in favor of modern ideas. The Torah lifestyle is untouchable. It is not subject to the whims of history or the fickle winds of change. In his own words:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We are witness to a profoundly disturbing, religiously untenable phenomenon. Consciously or unconsciously, people want to hold fast onto some secular, anti-Torah Western values and, simultaneously, Torah. Their commitment to some anti-Torah values casts Torah, to a degree, in an adversarial role. And thus, consciously or unconsciously, in a futile attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable they push, twist and manipulate Halachah to make it more congenial to their opposing Western values. Somehow or other Torah has to be made malleable enough to accommodate their dual loyalties.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iStock_000003443280Medium.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8258" alt="wind farm" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iStock_000003443280Medium.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I think it&#8217;s important to evaluate this particular claim. That is, the claim that Torah must resist all external social forces and maintain its purest form. It seems to me that in order to make this claim there is an assumption that what we call Torah today was never affected by extrinsic value systems and preferences. I believe that this assumption is either demonstrably false or requires making many more assumptions to justify this assumption. I&#8217;ve identified ten fairly benign examples in recorded history that force us to consider whether what we call Torah was always called Torah or if Torah has been subject to social trends.</p>
<p>1. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Tables" target="_blank">Twelve Tables of Roman Law</a> (~450 BCE) is the first recording of procedural law. It coincided with the first attempts to codify and record the Oral Law by the Pharisees which eventually became the Mishnah, our code of procedural and religious law.</p>
<p>2. Zoroastrian astrology is <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0019_0_19548.html" target="_blank">present in the Talmud</a>. Babylonian Amoraim included ideas that are uniquely Zoroastrian in some of their <em>aggadic</em> teachings.</p>
<p>3. Arab philosophy in the school of Aristotle was the dominant philosophy in the 11th century. Maimonides and others <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides#Philosophy" target="_blank">reconciled Aristotelian philosophy</a> and the Torah in the same time and place.</p>
<p>4. Christian ascetics living in Central Europe popularized <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LXByzyf-mFIC&amp;lpg=PA412&amp;ots=4scDgtvI7u&amp;dq=The%20Penitential%20System%20of%20Hasidei%20Ashkenaz%20and%20the%20Problem%20of%20Cultural%20Boundaries&amp;pg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">many of the same ideas </a>and practices found in the works of the <em>Chasidei Ashkenaz</em> in the 12th and 13th centuries.</p>
<p>5. In the 16th century a Catholic code of law called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_history_of_the_Catholic_Church#Jus_Novissimum" target="_blank">Jus Novissimum</a> was published. This was the first attempt at synchronizing the many competing codes extant in the Catholic Church. Rabbi Yosef Karo published the Shulchan Aruch in 1563. His work synchronized and decided between competing opinions found in prior Jewish codes of law.</p>
<p>6. The 16th century was the golden era of Christian and Muslim <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/21/book-review-between-worlds-dybbuks-exorcists-and-early-modern-judaism/" target="_blank">exorcism</a>. The Arizal popularized and performed <em>dybbuk</em> removal during the same era.</p>
<p>7. The Industrial Revolution swept through Europe and changed the manner in which people labored and earned a living forever in the early 19th century. More options were available for earning a living and <a href="http://sociology.about.com/od/Disciplines/a/Sociology-Of-Work-And-Industry.htm" target="_blank">work came to become part of one&#8217;s identity</a>. In its wake, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch established a philosophy of <em>Torah Im Derech Eretz</em> that gave value and meaning to one&#8217;s pursuit of a living.</p>
<p>8. The turn of the 20th century featured intense nationalist feelings and identification with one&#8217;s citizenship. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Zionism" target="_blank">Religious Zionism</a> and spiritual identification with the land of Israel flourished in the late 19th century and was adopted by Rav Kook. While Europe bubbled over from overzealous <a href="http://alphahistory.com/worldwar1/nationalism/" target="_blank">nationalism</a> and apocalyptic wars, Rav Kook integrated Zionism and Orthodox Judaism into a Messianic vision.</p>
<p>9. There was a drastic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_the_United_States#Progressive_Era" target="_blank">expansion of public educatio</a>n in America between 1890 and 1930. In 1917 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Schenirer">Sarah Schenirer</a> founded the first Bais Yaakov school for girls. In 1928<a href="https://www.yu.edu/yeshiva-college/mission-history/" target="_blank"> Yeshiva College</a> was founded in an effort to combine Torah education with secular education.</p>
<p>10. Congress passed the Equal Rights Act for women in 1972. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10102206365901875?stream_ref=10" target="_blank">Rabbi Lamm explicitly celebrated</a> this new legislation that changed the role of women in America. At the same time he noted the following:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;If ten women so desire, they may organize a minyan and conduct tefillah b’tzibur, public services; and in such a case, if men straggle in to such a synagogue, it is they who are guests sitting behind the mechitza. I am told that in Boston there is a group of young Orthodox students, all girls, who are highly concerned about their role in Judaism, and have decided to pray every morning while donning the tefillin. I have no objection to that, and would encourage them</em></p>
<p><em>There was a time that according to Rama such behavior was frowned upon as </em>yuhara<em>, or arrogance, but that was because it was an act of exhibitionism by an individual. However, the case is far different when a whole community of women has decided to accept such a mitzvah. More power to them! I wish that every *man* would join a minyan to lay tefillin!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Torah and the things that we call Torah are either oddly synchronized with external influences or are subject to the changing ideals of the outside world. It&#8217;s one or the other. I think that ten examples from across the spectrum of time and space makes a compelling case that Torah can be reconciled with non-Torah philosophies.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION</strong> (6 hours after original post): Clearly, there is a great distinction between changing a particular law and these ten examples. But that has nothing to do with my point. I am saying that in order for Rabbi Twersky to argue that an outside idea like egalitarianism (for which he has a non-conventional definition) may not penetrate or influence the way we think about Torah and halacha under any circumstances, one needs to also assume that the version of Torah culture and values we have today has been untouched by other outside ideas. Because he has set up the structure in a way that pits this particular outside idea (again, not the application of the idea to law, the idea) as external to Torah and matched it up against &#8220;Pure Torah,&#8221; the choice is obviously that Pure Torah wins.</p>
<p>My point is that this is not a valid way to set up the structure of the issue. The valid way to structure the issue would be to say that we have a modern idea of egalitarianism that sometimes conflicts with many current Torah practices, perhaps some of these ideals should help shape the next version of Torah in much the same way that other cultures and revolutions affected the evolution of Torah in their times. In other words, is egalitarianism similar to any of the ten examples above in that it can play a role in shaping an Orthodox Torah lifestyle? I am not arguing that &#8220;therefore Rabbi Twersky is incorrect and women must be allowed to wear tefillin.&#8221; I am simply objecting to the way Rabbi Twersky dismisses the possibility that egalitarianism might have a seat at the table of competing ideas that will have a say in the way Torah evolves moving forward.</p>
<p>To be clear, I am not arguing that all change is acceptable. Nor am I arguing that a half-hearted, or even nearly full-hearted attempt at egalitarianism is the correct approach. I am not taking a position on the issue of women wearing tefillin in this essay. I am simply questioning the assumption of Rabbi Twersky&#8217;s argument that the Torah is never subject to the winds of change.</p>
<p>Instead of making the case that Torah cannot adapt to modernity under any circumstances, Rabbi Twersky and others should make the case that in <em>this</em> case Torah should not adjust to egalitarian ideals that can be reconciled with some halachic precedent. There is a big difference between the two, namely, intellectual honesty. Please don&#8217;t spit on us and tell us it&#8217;s raining.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the more interesting ways to frame the question of Orthodox Jewish women wearing tefillin is in the context of yesterday&#8217;s post. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/02/24/life-is-in-its-struggles-dealing-with-the-tough-questions/">Life is in its Struggles: Dealing With the Tough Questions</a>)</p>
<p>Many of the statements made about women in the Talmud that sound offensive to us relate to women studying Torah. The objections to women learning Torah are mostly an issue of cognition or intellectual prowess. Regardless, the accepted unequivocal conclusion of the Talmud is that women should not study Torah.<span id="more-8160"></span></p>
<p>The parameters of this prohibition are not as broad as the Talmud seems to imply. The most restrictive opinions in the achronim say they may only learn the laws that are relevant to their practice. The Rambam says they are only prohibited from studying the Oral Law but he seems to hinge it upon their overall academic abilities which are fluid and subjective. The Chida famously said that if a woman wants to learn she can learn whatever she wants.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/two-tracks-converging.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8161" alt="two-tracks-converging" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/two-tracks-converging.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The point is that the very harsh statements of the Talmud regarding teaching women Torah has been narrowly tailored even according to the least permissive opinion. No one reads the halachic part of this rabbinic ban on Torah study for women without some form liberal interpretation.</p>
<p>When we contrast this with the statements of the Talmud regarding women wearing tefillin we see the opposite process. The Mishna simply says that women are exempt from tefillin. The Talmud never says explicitly that women should not wear tefillin. The Sefer HaChinuch discusses whether women would make the blessing on tefillin without saying that it is prohibited. We don&#8217;t know if women actually did wear tefillin but from a Talmudic perspective, they would have been allowed to wear tefillin.</p>
<p>Instead, the Rama is the one who makes the liberal statement of the Talmud more restrictive than it&#8217;s simple reading. The Rama says that women are exempt from tefillin but they should be strongly discouraged from wearing them. As an aside, I think it is reasonable that the Rama&#8217;s citation that <a href="http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.88" target="_blank">women should not touch Torah scrolls</a> is relevant and might have influenced his tefillin position. Something to think about.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2014 and it&#8217;s not just that they should be discouraged, it&#8217;s that it&#8217;s prohibited altogether. It&#8217;s even been said that women wearing tefillin today is a form of sectarianism. This is so far from the position stated in the Mishnah that it has to make us wonder how this happened.</p>
<p>I think it is worth noticing that these two trains are going in opposite directions on two different sets of tracks. I can&#8217;t explain or account for these very different story lines with any degree of certainty but I do have a guess. It could be that in the view of the poskim along the way, the leniencies regarding studying Torah are a &#8220;necessary evil&#8221; but are not ideal at all. It was just impossible to tell girls that they cannot study Torah in modern society. Plus there is the Chida. There is no such necessity for tefillin and there is no Chida (although there is the Chinuch and Michal bas Shaul).</p>
<p>That does not account for the increasingly stringent views on tefillin. That might just be the same as any other increasingly stringent halachic development. The combination of necessary and precedent might explain the reason for increasingly liberal positions on Torah study for women. It might also provide the blueprint for adjustments to our views on women wearing tefillin and other similar issues. Time will tell.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wouldn&#8217;t quite call it a trend, but a growing number of women and girls in the Orthodox Jewish community are interested in wearing tefillin publicly. Two Modern Orthodox schools have made public statements that indicate they will allow, not encourage or discourage, their students to wear tefillin.</p>
<p>This has generated a lot of discussion, mostly negative, from within the Orthodox Jewish community. Some of the JewsNews sites have reported this bit of news in a very negative way. Some, to the very liberal side of Orthodox Judaism have embraced the decision.<span id="more-8076"></span></p>
<p>The halachic background is not overly complex. Technically, tefillin should fall into the same category as all other time bound mitzvos. Lulav, Shofar, Sukkah, and daily prayer are also time bound mitzvos and are voluntary for women. The conclusion in the Talmud exempts women from tefillin. Some rishonim explicitly permit tefillin for women. Some explicitly prohibit it. The Rema famously discourages it. That is, he does not prohibit it, he just advises against it. Some of the Achronim explain why it would be prohibited or advised against. <a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tefillin_barbie.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8077" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tefillin_barbie.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Some people are assuming their intentions are less than perfect. That&#8217;s complete conjecture and not something worth discussing. But I think the halachic arguments are important. I also think that working out whether it&#8217;s permitted or prohibited is vital. But I think it&#8217;s misplaced in the context of the current issue. The discussion right now should not be whether it&#8217;s good policy or against our best interests to allow women to wear tefillin.</p>
<p>Instead, the discussion should be whether we <em>tolerate</em> women who want to wear tefillin in Orthodox Judaism. In other words, even if I disagree with their decision, is this something worth the cost of declarations and opinions that cast these women and these institutions in a negative light?</p>
<p>We already disagree on plenty of things and we can get along just fine. Some eat kitniyos on Pesach, others do not. Some use the eruv, some do not. Some open soda cans on Shabbos, others do not. Some visit rebbes and ask for blessings, others do not. Some go to Uman, others do not. Some say Kabbalas Shabbos, others do not. Some do Yom Kippur Katan, others do not. Some do every segula, some do none. There are literally hundreds of things that already divide us in practice. Yet we are capable of carrying on as a group. I don&#8217;t see why a few women putting on tefillin should be such a drastic decision that it means more than eating in the Sukkah on Shmini Atzeres vs. not eating in the Sukkah on Shmini Atzeres.</p>
<p>In other words, what are the stakes here? And why are they being presented as so great? What is going to happen if a few women wear tefillin? What&#8217;s the dire consequence that we must avoid at all costs?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see it. I think those who don&#8217;t want women to wear tefillin should just not wear tefillin or even teach their daughters that they don&#8217;t think they should wear tefillin. But I don&#8217;t see how doing a mitzvah can make someone unorthodox.</p>
<p>If an opponent of women wearing tefillin found out his daughter started wearing tefillin, would the daughter be disowned? I can&#8217;t imagine. So why are we disowning other daughters?</p>
<p>The opposition must identify something objectively wrong that will happen if we <em>tolerate </em>a few women wearing tefillin. Or even if we <em>tolerate </em>many women wearing tefillin. Until they&#8217;ve done so, I don&#8217;t think we can allow this difference to divide us. We&#8217;ve been able to avoid completely breaking apart over a million other things. I don&#8217;t accept that this particular issue is so vital that it must break us up now.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years of research and development, a man-made hamburger was publicly tasted for the first time last week. The burger was not animal flesh, instead it was grown in a laboratory. However, it was grown in a way that mimics the way animals grow their own flesh. Thus, it was pretty close to dead animal meat in flavor and texture.</p>
<p>This incredible scientific breakthrough prompted a plethora of questions. For the religious community with rituals and laws attached to the eating of meat even more questions were asked.<span id="more-7459"></span></p>
<p>It seemed that one could hardly browse the Internet for five seconds without seeing a juicy soundbite (sorry, couldn&#8217;t resist) about whether the meat was kosher or whether is was meat at all. Chabad&#8217;s website had one approach. OU had another approach. Reuters had a third opinion in their article. NBC added another view.</p>
<p>I must have been asked by a dozen people what to make of the man-made meat mystery.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7460" alt="k-bigpic" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/k-bigpic.gif?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This is what I think. No one has any idea what they are talking about. Non-scientists have no chance of understanding the precise manner in which this meat was manufactured. I have tried to understand how it all works and it is almost impossible to find the full technical explanation with all the requisite background information. A very smart scientists tried explaining it to me, but even after I got the gist of the process I had more questions about stem cells and other background than I had before he explained it to me. I am pretty confident that Chabad, OU, the Reuters people, and even NBC News reporters don&#8217;t have a clue how this meat is made.</p>
<p>Sure, they  say &#8220;don&#8217;t rely on this for halacha&#8221; or something to that effect, but that makes things even worse. Why offer a meaningless opinion that is based on ignorance? It seems to make a mockery of Jewish law. But Jewish law is very serious and serious people will offer serious opinions on this matter. The proper response for almost the entire population of planet Earth to these eternal questions about man-made meat is &#8220;I am not qualified to render an opinion on this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a thorough understanding of how the meat is made, any discussion of the halachic ramifications of the meat is not even conjecture. It is pure fantasy. Further, deciding the halachic status of this issue will require a breadth of Torah knowledge that is possessed by a mere handful of people on the planet. You can&#8217;t <em>pasken</em> this <em>shyla</em> with Yad Moshe, Google, or the Otzar. This is a brand new question of Jewish law and will need serious investigation into the science and the various tenuously analogous precedents in Jewish law. The Torah does not discuss synthetic meat. And even if it did, who says this meat would be the same as the synthetic meat found in Jewish law?</p>
<p>The only way this question can be seriously answered is with a conference of scientists and rabbis who fit the descriptions above. Scientists who can thoroughly explain how the meat is made and Torah scholars who know <em>kol haTorah kula</em> will need to decide this issue. Anyone else jumping into the discussion is wielding a knife in a nuclear war. It&#8217;s that useless.</p>
<p>If I can, I will try to attain a scientific understanding of how this meat is produced and then perhaps I will be qualified to even ask the question to my (qualified) <em>posek.</em> But until such time, I wouldn&#8217;t dare wade into this very, very deep pool. I think this is the proper policy under the circumstances. We sound more educated and cutting edge when we admit what we don&#8217;t know as opposed to when we pretend we know what we are discussing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1776.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7022" alt="1776" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/1776.jpg?resize=300%2C200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Lag B&#8217;Omer is on Sunday. This means the entire State of Israel (and many Jewish areas around the world) will be lit with bonfires, the city of Safed and Meron will host thousands of pilgrims to the grave of R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai, schools will take their students on outings, some people will watch great rabbis shoot a bow and arrow, young boys will get their first haircuts, charity will be given for holy water, and songs will be sung to remember R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai. This is all aside from all proliferation of bogus Lag B&#8217;Omer segulos that bombard us.</p>
<p>These are all Lag B&#8217;Omer traditions that are a part of our culture.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all great fun and all, and I don&#8217;t mean to rain on anyone&#8217;s parade (or bonfire) but we do need to question whether these activities are appropriate.<span id="more-7021"></span></p>
<p>Lag B&#8217;Omer is a very recent holiday. It&#8217;s not in the Mishna, Talmud, Geonim, Rishonim, Shulchan Aruch, or Rema. Because it is not found in our traditional books and sources, it is worth thinking about the contemporary celebrations of Lag B&#8217;Omer in the broad context of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>If I would tell you that there is a holiday where people make a pilgrimage to a tomb, light bonfires, dance around the fires, give money for holy water, sing songs about a great man, and make a religious ceremony out of a haircut, would you think that sounded like a traditional Jewish holiday? It wouldn&#8217;t to me. To me it sounds a bit pagan.</p>
<p>And it makes sense that it doesn&#8217;t sound familiar to the Jewish ear, because it is a new holiday which was certainly influenced by outside factors.</p>
<p>There are many halachic concerns regarding some of these practices. Just because they are done, does not mean they are right. Certainly it is possible to participate in all the Lag B&#8217;Omer fun and excitement without violating halacha. But it is not an easy task. If anyone starts to think that R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai is praying on their behalf, that could be idol worship. Or if someone venerates R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai as a spiritual power, that could be idol worship. If the haircuts at three years old at a tomb are borrowed from idol worship, it&#8217;s a problem. If giving money for holy water is a borrowed from Christianity, it&#8217;s a problem. Relying on charms and magic is a problem.</p>
<p>So you see, it&#8217;s not so simple to celebrate the new holiday of Lag B&#8217;Omer.</p>
<p>But the most important question we have to ask ourselves is why are we celebrating Lag B&#8217;Omer in this manner? How did this happen? How did it come to be that a holiday which was invented in the last few hundreds years has become a very religiously significant event? So much so that people will read this post and wonder if I am orthodox? How did this happen?</p>
<p>And one last question: Should R&#8217; Shimon bar Yochai really be our biggest rabbinic hero? See this post on DovBear for more that: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/05/mitzvoth-not-magic-or-what-about-r.html">Mitzvoth not magic: Or what about R. Yehuda?</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, but I don&#8217;t think we will like the answer if we ever find out.</p>

I answered <em>&#8220;oisek b&#8217;mitzvah patur min hamitzvah&#8221;</em>. That question and answer spawned an idea in my head. I started thinking of all sorts of rules for Christmas in the context of halacha. That morphed into a #hilchoschristmas hashtag game on Twitter.</p>
<p>Here is the original post by my friend Dovid Ptalis: <em>(since made private)</em></p>

</div>
<p>I asked my followers if they had any #hilchoschristmas, I gave a few examples, and within a few minutes the tweets were coming fast and furious. Some came as <em>&#8220;shylas&#8221;</em> and other just wrote their own rules. After a little while it wasn&#8217;t just my Twitter followers playing. People I don&#8217;t know and people that don&#8217;t know me were following the hashtag and adding their own excellent contribtions. We had a great time. (It&#8217;s still going four days later, albeit at a much slower pace right now).</p>
<p>Only two Twitter Grinches thought that this game was offensive; one thought it was offensive to Christians. To be very clear, this is not a joke about Christmas, it&#8217;s just a lighthearted way of poking fun at halacha, chumros, and segulos. In no way is it meant to disrespect Christmas or Jewish law. We can laugh at ourselves. Think of it as Purim Torah for Christmas.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-tweeters-debate-christmas-laws/" target="_blank">The Times of Israel picked up on the phenomenon</a> but didn&#8217;t really go back far enough to find some of the best, early #hilchoschristmas hashtag. I didn&#8217;t want these tweets to be lost forever so I archived some of my favorites on Storify. (Thanks Shulem Deen for the idea). I tried to use the Twitter embed tool but apparently there were too many tweets for it to work properly.</p>
<p>Enjoy! And it&#8217;s not too late to get in on the fun. Just get on your Twitter account, tweet your ideas and makes sure you include the #hilchoschristmas tweet. Unfortunately, some tweets were missing the hashtag so those will be impossible to find.</p>
<p>To see all the tweets, search the #hilchoschristmas hashtag on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23hilchoschristmas&amp;src=tyah" target="_blank">#hilchoschristmas</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/furnace-fire.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6606" title="furnace-fire" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/furnace-fire.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In Parshas Vayeshev we read the story of Tamar and Yehuda. Tamar is suspected of being harlot and following her conviction, she is sentenced to death by burning. Instead of exonerating herself by outing Yehuda, she accepts her fate and merely produces some evidence that shows Yehuda surreptitiously that he was the one who was with her.</p>
<p>The Talmud says that this teaches us that it is better to be burned alive in a fiery furnace than to embarrass one&#8217;s friend in public.</p>
<p>Tosafos ask the obvious question: If one must die in a fiery furnace rather than embarrass one&#8217;s friend, it should be included with the three cardinal sins of Judaism for which a Jew is required to give up one&#8217;s life? Those are murder, adultery, and idol worship. If embarrassing a friend must be avoided at the cost of death &#8211; it is equal to those three! Why is it omitted from the list?</p>
<p>Tosafos answer that only things that are explicit in the Torah are included in the list.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah infers that Tosafos mean that one is in fact required to give up one&#8217;s life to spare a friend embarrassment. Meaning that halachically there is no<em> </em>leeway. One must give up one&#8217;s life in order that one&#8217;s friend not be embarrassed.</p>
<p>This does not make the Torah Temimah happy.<span id="more-6604"></span> He says &#8220;if not for their words I think&#8230;&#8221; which is rabbinic code for &#8220;I very respectfully disagree&#8221;. Instead the Torah Temimah says (translation mine) that it is clear that one cannot include embarrassing a friend in the list of three cardinal sins. Rather he says that the Talmud was teaching <em>mussar</em> and good etiquette. One who does not heed the advice of the rabbis of the Talmud is not a called a <em>rasha,</em> rather he is just a person with bad character. Whereas with the three cardinal sins, the law actually requires one to martyr oneself rather than sin. One who violates one of those sins is a <em>rasha</em> and it is as if he violated the basic tenets of faith.</p>
<p>I think the significant thing here is not so much that the Torah Temimah has a different answer than Tosafos. The bomb here is that the Torah Temimah is willing to tame an extreme statement of Chazal and call it <em>mussar </em>instead of taking it literally. Tosafos did not do that. Many charedim today do not do that. But the Torah Temimah was willing to reinterpret an extreme statement of Chazal and say it was not halachic, rather it was a sermonic point that was designed to urge people to act properly without setting actual parameters of legal ramifications.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Small-Business-Saturday.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6539" title="Small-Business-Saturday" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Small-Business-Saturday.jpg?resize=279%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I wasn&#8217;t going to write a post about this so I did a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10101217351998665" target="_blank">short blurb on Facebook</a> (you can read the post and the excellent comments even if you don&#8217;t have Facebook). But the conversation was very enlightening and I have decided to do a post.</em></p>
<p>On Saturday, American Express sponsored Small Business Saturday (SBS). To help promote small businesses (and their brand) AMEX offered a $25 credit to anyone who used a registered AMEX card at a participating small business.</p>
<p>Many schools and charity organizations urged their supporters to register and donate $25 using their AMEX. This would give the institution a $25 (minus fees) donation and the donor would recoup the $25 from AMEX. So in essence it was a free $25 for the institution. Sounds like a win / win.</p>
<p>On its face, the participation of charities and religious institutions seems like it could be an issue. The concept here is to promote small business with purchases. &#8220;Spending $25&#8221; at a shul or school simply for the sake of a donation is  not within the spirit of the promotion. But reasonable people could argue this point.</p>
<p>The problem is that SBS has rules.<span id="more-6538"></span> <a href="http://f.cl.ly/items/0W3T2x183K0j1X3Q2536/amex-sbs-terms-2012.pdf" target="_blank">The rules state</a>:</p>
<div title="Page 1">
<div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Program is only available to qualifying small businesses. For the purpose of this Program, qualifying small businesses include small, locally-owned storefront and online businesses with $10 million in annual revenue or less. Businesses in the following industries are excluded: government agencies, charities, non-profits, trade associations, shopping property management firms, political, religious and educational organizations.</em></p>
<p> It seems pretty clear that shuls, yeshivas, tzedaka organizations, and any other frum (or not frum) Not-For-Profit would not be eligible to participate in SBS. (And by the way, we were able to find a few Churches that asked for $25 donations on SBS).</p>
<p>But things are not so simple.</p>
<p>First of all, AMEX knows which vendors are NFPs or religious institutions. Yet, they accept SBS submissions from these vendors. This seems to be in defiance of their own rules. Further, at least a few institutions contacted AMEX and asked if they were in fact eligible for SBS and AMEX told them that they were eligible! Once again, AMEX defied their own rules. Complicating things even worse is the fact that AMEX told several other institutions that they were not eligible for SBS.</p>
<p>Turns out, AMEX has no idea what they are doing. Different organizations were told different things and they don&#8217;t even know their own rules. So what&#8217;s the verdict?</p>
<p>Here is what I think. If you asked AMEX and they said your organization is not eligible, there is no question that you should not be participating. Yes, that is even if they will accept your charges. Taking advantage of their mistake when you know that they are making a mistake is unethical. Sure, &#8220;<em>taus akum</em>&#8221; is permissible. But that doesn&#8217;t mean you <em>should </em>take advantage. And it might only apply after the mistake happened, but to knowingly take advantage of a mistake is different.</p>
<p>If you asked AMEX and they said your organization is eligible and you did not know that their own rules said that your organization was not eligible, I have no problem with your organization participating in SBS. I don&#8217;t love it, but it&#8217;s hard for me to complain.</p>
<p>If you asked AMEX and they said your organization is eligible and you <em>did </em>know that their own rules said that your organization was not eligible, I think you should still refrain from participating in SBS. While it is true that someone at AMEX told you that you could participate, you knew that you could not participate. It seems difficult for me to sign off on that. Just because a call-center agent doesn&#8217;t know AMEX&#8217;s rules doesn&#8217;t exonerate you from following those rules. Imagine one idiot police officer told you that you could drive 80 in a clearly marked 55 MPH zone and another officer pulls you over for speeding. You&#8217;re not going to be able to blame it on the first officer. You&#8217;re going to get a citation. It&#8217;s not the exact same thing, but it&#8217;s close.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t ask AMEX if your organization could participate I think you might think that ignorance is bliss. But it&#8217;s not. If you are going to participate in a promotion like this, especially one that involves free money, you need to do your due diligence. You need to make sure you can participate. If you didn&#8217;t even care to look into it, I find that problematic.</p>
<p>I hope that at the very least, AMEX will clarify their position for SBS 2013 and the halachically conscious public will be sure to ascertain their eligibility before spamming their supporters to &#8220;spend $25&#8221; on a donation to their institution.</p>

<p>By now you&#8217;ve probably heard that Anat Hoffman was arrested at the Western Wall last week. You may have read her personal account that describes a harrowing encounter with law enforcement. I don&#8217;t know if her claims are true or exaggerated, but her claims are irrelevant. Nor does it matter what sensationalist headlines have been penned.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post we will focus exclusively on facts and then my opinion based on those facts. Here are the facts:</p>
<p>Women of the Wall is an organization whose &#8220;mission is to achieve the social and legal recognition of our right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray, and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those facts are undisputed. They are agitators. They are trying to change the status quo. They are activists.<span id="more-6360"></span></p>
<p>Anat Hoffman is their leader and her mission is to agitate, change the status quo. She is the chief activist.</p>
<p>The Women of the Wall write on their website that the law at the Western Wall is that no religious ceremony may be performed in the Women&#8217;s section of the Western Wall plaza. Although this is not a primary source, and I cannot find the primary source (feel free to fill me in), we will consider this a fact as well. The law has been interpreted to ban women from blowing a shofar or wearing a prayer shawl and from reading the Torah out loud.</p>
<p>Anat Hoffman leads a women&#8217;s prayer group at the Western Wall from time to time. She wears a prayer shawl and reads from the Torah. On several occasions Ms. Hoffman has been asked or demanded to cease these illegal activities. She does not acquiesce. She gets arrested.</p>
<p>This has happened several times. Each time it happens the media gets excited about it, Women of the Wall gets publicity, and&#8230; nothing changes.</p>
<p>Supporters of WOW find the law offensive and the subsequent arrests and treatment subversive.</p>
<p>Traditionalists consider Hoffman a disingenuous troublemaker who deserves what she gets.</p>
<p>Here is where the facts end and my opinion begins.</p>
<p>The law prohibiting women from religious ceremony at the Western Wall is a law that is written by orthodox rabbis to preserve the sanctity of their holiest place.They honestly believe that a woman who blows a shofar, or wears a prayer shawl, or reads from the Torah is an affront to God and the Holiness of the Western Wall. My question for them is why?</p>
<p>There is no prohibition against a woman doing any of these mitzvos. In fact, R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein writes that women are welcome to do these mitzvahs. There is nothing wrong with a woman reading from a Torah scroll for other women. Nothing at all. To be clear, the law is prohibiting actions that are permissible according to halacha. I find this hard to stomach.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s grant the rabbis of the Western Wall the power to legislate the decorum of the Western Wall. While this may be offensive to non-orthodox Jews, I can also understand why they have control over the Wall. But the rabbis of the Wall are only granted the right to legislate the Wall in accordance with Jewish law! So it is reasonable that they would prohibit men and women from praying together. It is also reasonable that they would mandate reasonably modest dress at the Wall. But it is not reasonable to enforce a rule that prevents people from performing mitzvahs that they are granted permission to perform!</p>
<p>It is hard to condone the law as it currently stands.</p>
<p>Some people have a hard time giving credence to an agitator like Anat Hoffman. While it may be challenging for Traditionalists to support her cause, the broader message of her cause is universal. All people should be granted the right to serve God at the Western Wall so long as it does not violate halacha. It seems hard to oppose that kind of rule.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really feel bad for Ms. Hoffman. She knows what is coming to her when she agitates the establishment. But just because she knows what is coming to her, that does not mean that her battle is not my battle. I empathize with Ms. Hoffman and I support her right to worship God at her holiest of places so long as she conforms to halacha. She has. Getting arrested for following halacha and doing a mitzvah at the Western Wall should not be the norm. This is a form of religious persecution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only the more liberal branches of Judaism have publically supported Ms. Hoffman.</p>
<p>This is the least effective way to change the established rules. Hopefully, the powers that be at the Western Wall will see the beauty and value in allowing women to pray in accordance with halacha even if it is not in accordance with their personal preferences and standards.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tombstone.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5719" title="tombstone" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/tombstone.jpg?resize=300%2C178" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>An older, single gentleman in my shul lost his mother last year. We both flew to New York for the funeral in West Babylon on Long Island, where my father and father-in-law met us with a minyan of my personal friends and family who took 5 hours out of their time to participate in the mitzvah of giving proper honor to the dead. The surviving son had no friends and (welcome) family in New York (although one relative couple did crash the funeral just to make trouble) and the effort these people made to be at the funeral was really appreciated.</p>
<p>This week, we arranged for an unveiling and once again I was responsible to find a minyan. While an unveiling can be done without a minyan, the gentleman really wanted to say kaddish at his mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s graves, especially because he rarely makes the trip from Los Angeles to New York. As it were, both my father and father in law were unable to arrange their schedules to join us. I had one friend who was able to come and one brother in law who was able to be there as well.</p>
<p>That left us six people short.</p>
<p>So I took to social media. I posted a notice on Facebook and Twitter. I got a lot of responses. It was really encouraging and I thought it was great that we could use the Internet for chessed.<span id="more-5718"></span> Most people wanted to know what I needed help doing and when I told them, they were unable to make the trip. That was fine and I appreciated their interest and that they reached out to me.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to find six people. Notices were placed on community lists. They generated no interest. No one was interested in making the trip.</p>
<p>Only three people volunteered to come and were actually able to make the trip. These three people shared one thing. They were all Jewish men who were orthodox (or chasidic) in the younger years and had made the choice to leave orthodox Judaism later on in life.</p>
<p>I was thrilled to have these three volunteers and two of them even offered to bring friends along. One friend was able to come and the other could not. So I had four volunteers. All ex-orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>It was well after midnight the night before the 11 AM ceremony and I was frantic on gChat trying to find a couple more people. I asked a few people directly if they could please do me a favor and come to the unveiling. Luckily my new friend Dovid Teitlebaum was willing to make the trip and bring a couple teenage guys.<em> [Thank you SO MUCH, Dovid. You really saved me!]</em> I had my minyan.</p>
<p>Of the eleven people who I was expecting, 10 made it on time(-ish). The eleventh guy miscalculated his travel time. But he made it just as we were wrapping things up. We did the ceremony. Everyone was very respectful and played their role perfectly. The gentleman was so appreciative and so was I. It meant a lot to both of us that we were able to arrange a minyan.</p>
<p>It was especially meaningful that some people volunteered to take time out of their day to make a minyan. It was interesting that the volunteers were no longer orthodox Jews.</p>
<p><em>[I could end here and let you draw your own conclusions and formulate your own thoughts. But I will continue and share what I am thinking.]</em></p>
<p>Orthodox Jews, as has been well documented, are overwhelmingly charitable with their time and money. Usually, orthodox Jews can be counted on for acts of selfless kindness that go well beyond what is normal. So what happened here?</p>
<p>It could just be that this was an anomaly. Or that no one wants to help me because they don&#8217;t like me. Who knows?</p>
<p>But I have a little theory. Halacha drives so much of orthodox Jewish life. In halacha there is no need for a minyan at an unveiling. Therefore, making the minyan for an unveiling is not looked at as such a priority. Other concerns take precedent in the hierarchy of halacha. That is fine. I don&#8217;t have a problem with that.</p>
<p>It just strikes me that when one takes halacha out of the calculation, making this minyan clearly meant a lot to this gentleman and to me. Forget about halacha for a second. It was clearly a really nice thing to do. It clearly would have made this gentleman feel so good. It clearly would have helped me. It seems so obvious that helping making the minyan was a good and nice and helpful and generous thing to do.</p>
<p>So, I think sometimes it takes someone outside the system to see past the trees and notice the forest. But it reminds us that we, who are meticulous about halacha, can&#8217;t forget to see the forest as well. Would I have volunteered if someone I knew or barely knew asked for my help making a minyan for an unveiling? Probably not.</p>
<p>Have these four men inspired me to say yes next time? Yes they have. Absolutely.</p>
<p>So <strong>Joshie</strong>, <strong>Yitzchok</strong>, <strong>Aly</strong>, and <strong>Abe</strong>, thank you for being the volunteers and making the minyan, but most of all thank you for reminding me to see the forest, not just the trees and inspiring me to say YES next time I can do a nice thing for someone else.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5006" title="argue" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/argue-300x216.jpg?resize=300%2C216" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/01/02/yossi-sarid-shows-us-the-ugly-side-of-secular-extremism/" target="_blank">Yesterday, I wrote about Yossi Sarid&#8217;s disgraceful article of vile hatred for halachic Judaism</a>. I expressed my discomfort in writing a point by point response because when first started to write a point by point rebuttal, it came off as sounded apologetic and disingenuous. I was not able to articulate how and why Sarid was wrong in every one of his examples. I tried. But I was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yair Hoffman also tried. His article is a lot like the one I was writing. It explains a few of the statements that Sarid misquoted or misinterpreted. More importantly it provides quite a few important sources that indicate reverence, respect and admiration for women in the Talmud. Clearly, Sarid ignores as many, if not more, sources than he barbarically wields in his unscrupulous attack on halacha.</p>
<p>This is great work by Rabbi Hoffman. But in the end all he has done is presented another side to the story. He has shown that the Talmud has statements that are praiseworthy or women and there are also statements that portray women negatively. This is because he does not refute the majority of Sarid&#8217;s sources.</p>
<p>I decided to analyze the debate systematically.<span id="more-5004"></span></p>
<p>Saird mentions 16 negative sources in his article. Rabbi Hoffman addresses FOUR of them. Of the TWELVE he ignores, some of them are the most difficult to explain.</p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman uses a variety of methods to refute the four sources he actually addresses.</p>
<p>Sarid says: <em>&#8220;She is unfit for any public position with authority. &#8220;Thou shalt appoint a king over thee&#8221; &#8211; a king and not a queen.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman employs the &#8220;it is literal but it&#8217;s not so bad&#8221; argument. Meaning, yes it is true, but many other cultures and countries have had similar laws. Okay. Fair enough.</p>
<p>Sarid says: <em>&#8221; words of Torah should be burned rather than being given to women.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman correctly declares that this is out of context. It is true that the Talmud says this in the name of one rabbi, but since the Talmud actually addresses the question the woman asked that prompted the statement, clearly the rabbis felt that the question was a good question and this is really praise of a woman. While all of this is true, the statement remains in the text unchallenged. This is still offensive. Advantage Sarid.</p>
<p>Sarid mentions the prohibition against one who <em>&#8221; looks even at a woman&#8217;s little finger&#8221;.</em></p>
<p><em></em> Rabbi Hoffman explains that this is actually a preferred approach to women. In effect in &#8216;deobjectifies&#8217; women because it ensures that women will not be looked at as pure objects of desire. In fact it ensures that women will not be looked at, at all. Not a great job by Rabbi Hoffman, he could have added that the translation of Sarid is not perfect. It would be more accurate to state that the prohibition is against &#8220;gazing&#8221; at a women with lust.</p>
<p>One of Sarid&#8217;s last complaints is the statement in the Talmud that &#8220;calls women&#8221;, and I quote, <em>&#8220;a sack full of excrement&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Rabbi Hoffman is absolutely correct here. Sarid willfully distorts this source. The Talmud is saying that EVEN if a woman was a  &#8220;a sack full of excrement&#8221; a man would desire her physically. This is a statement about the strength of physical attraction. It is not a referendum on women. Sarid loses this one badly.</p>
<p>So in the four points of attack, Rabbi Hoffman argues valiantly. In some places he is better than others. But he does a good job.</p>
<p>The problem is that there are TWELVE more sources that go unaddressed. Among them, the most difficult to reconcile. Rabbi Hoffman does not address the law that prohibits women from testifying in court or becoming a judge, nor does he address the statement criticizing those who teach their daughters Torah. He ignores the obligation to save a drowning man before a drowning woman, he ignores the Talmud&#8217;s statement that allows men to divorce without his wife&#8217;s consent and the requirement that women be at her husband&#8217;s disposal when he desires her.</p>
<p>Some of these statements can be explained. Others really cannot. In some ways Sarid is right. The world does not look upon many of these laws and statements favorably.</p>
<p>In none of his explanations does Rabbi Hoffman invoke the argument that things may have changed since the time of the Talmud. In no place does he say that the statements in the Talmud are reflective of an ancient society and that we have evolved from that society into a more contemporary version of Rabbinic Judaism. Rabbi Hoffman is not willing to say, in any case, that these any of sources are actually offensive and have fallen into disuse or reinterpreted because they are offensive.</p>
<p>In my opinion, that might be the only way to answer some of the questions raised by Sarid. But for some, saying this amounts to kefira or at least knocks one out of orthodox Judaism. But isn&#8217;t it true? Have we not adapted and evolved since the times of the Talmud? I think we have. I think it is also futile to deny it. I would really love to see a bona fide, contemporary Torah authority legitimize this approach. I can dream, can&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>This approach will not answer all the questions either. It will not fix some of the built-in disadvantages that women encounter in halachic Judaism. But I think it is more honest and gives us a chance to continue to adapt and evolve if necessary <em>and if our rabbinic leadership allows it</em>. But freezing us in time as Rabbi Hoffman has done will not win every argument. In this case it only won four out of sixteen.</p>

<p>I read the recent op-ed written by Yossi Sarid and published in Haaretz. I found the article highly offensive, despicable and ugly. I thought I would &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking" target="_blank">fisk</a>&#8221; the article and counter each and every one of Sarid&#8217;s twisted, angry points. I got through about half of Sarid&#8217;s ugly diatribe and I was forced to quit. I could not win. I was unable to refute every one of his points without twisting myself, Chazal and halacha into a stale pretzel.</p>
<p>So I gave up.</p>
<p>Instead, I offer two independant points in this blog post inspired by Sarid&#8217;s disgraceful article.</p>
<p>Sarid&#8217;s main point is that the extremists in Israel are only applying the lessons that are taught in our holy tradition. He proceeds to quote several sources that demonstrate his view of the way Judaism treats women. A few of his sources are misquoted. A few others are opinions of one rabbi and not every rabbi. But by and large, one can build a solid case against orthodox Judaism&#8217;s approach to women using Sarid&#8217;s sources.</p>
<p>By pointing to these sources, Sarid proposes that the extremists are just following the logical conclusions of halacha and traditional Judaism. Therefore the problem is not the extremists, the problem is all Jews who adhere to halacha. All forms of Judaism that believe in the veracity of Torah are to blamed. This is akin to one of Hitchens&#8217; more well-known arguments against religion. If extremists can follow the text of a religion and be bad people there is a flaw in the religion. Sarid lumps all Jews who follow halacha together. The extremists are extremists but only because they follow the same texts as I do, they just do it better.</p>
<p>Sarid is wrong. Dead Wrong.<span id="more-4997"></span> He is wrong because the extremists may be following the texts that he cites. But halachic Judaism does not follow those texts today. Yes. Believe it or not, even the most charedi of Jews do not have the same beliefs about women that some of our great rabbis had throughout our history. He claims that halacha prohibits teaching women Torah. This is obviously very easy to refute. Every orthodox Jewish woman studies Torah. This is an evolution of Judaism to conform to modernity. Some things are up for negotiation. Some things are not. But to represent orthodox Judaism as a whole by quoting a few obscure (and few less obscure) texts is ugly.</p>
<p>It is ugly because in practice, 99% of orthodox Jews don&#8217;t agree with the texts he quoted. The 1% who do are the extremists. Thus, is it disingenuous and provocative to lump all orthodox Jews together with regard to the way women are treated in orthodox Judaism. For this I am fuming with anger at Yossi Sarid. How dare he take a few quotes and a few crazies and paint the entire spectrum of orthodox Judaism with that brush? It is inexcusable. I hope he can find his way and retract his article. An apology would be appropriate as well.</p>
<p>The second point is that these texts do exist. They do need to be dealt with in a mature way. I am not qualified to dismiss these texts and I would not dare make a unilateral statement about these texts. But it would be wise for our rabbinic leadership (and by <em>our</em> rabbinic leadership, I mean the orthodox Jewish leadership from across the spectrum) to formulate responses and interpretations or dismissals of these texts. We need to have an approach that codifies the modern approaches that we have taken towards women over the last few centuries. The offensive texts cannot remain the only authoratative views on women.</p>
<p>It is clear and without a doubt that attitudes have changed towards women over the last 2500 years. This is not a Jewish phenomenon. Women have only had the right to vote and own land for a relatively short amount of time in the secular world. Jewish law has adapted as well. Women work outside the home. Women learn Torah. Women are expected to be treated with as much respect as one would like to be treated by others.</p>
<p>The problem is that the most authoratative sources that remain are those that are no longer followed by the majority of orthodox Jews. We need to educate ourselves and hateful people like Yossi Sarid that neither those texts, nor the extremists represent mainstream halachic Judaism.</p>
<p>I suggest you read Sarid&#8217;s diatribe. If only so that you should know what kind of perception one can have if one cherry picks from the traditional sources and to try to figure a way to explain these texts without becoming overly apologetic and without rejecting the sanctity of our tradition.</p>
<p>As much as I hate what the religious extremists are doing to pervert Torah Judaism, I hate what Yossi Sarid has written even more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2-kaparot.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4679" title="2 kaparot" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2-kaparot.jpg?resize=297%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><em>This post originally appeared on DovBear last High Holiday Season: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/09/why-i-wont-be-waving-chicken-over-my.html" target="_blank">Why I Won&#8217;t Be Waving a Chicken Over My Head This Week</a></em></p>
<p>For hundreds of years, rabbis have been trying to ban kaparos. The Rashba, the Ramban, the Bais Yosef and more recently, the Aruch Hashulchan all wanted to ban kaparos. Some did, and no one listened, others did not because they knew no one would listen.</p>
<p>Classically, the primary halachic objections to kaparos are the issue of &#8220;darkei Emori&#8221; (pagan ritual) and the likelihood of flawed shechita due to the high volume of chickens being shechted in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>Kaparos lives on. In fact kaparos with chickens has only increased in popularity in my lifetime.</p>
<p>I think it is time to end the kaparos with chickens custom. Here is why:<span id="more-4678"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Many smart rabbis have tried to ban the practice already. (see above for the two primary reasons &#8211; pagan / bad shechita)</li>
<li>When the great rabbis of yore try to ban a practice and the PEOPLE are persistent&#8230; I am suspicious.</li>
<li>The &#8220;reasons&#8221; given to justify kaparos are purely kabbalistic and have no other source in nigleh.</li>
<li>It appears like magic.</li>
<li>Saying the formula of &#8220;zeh tmurasi&#8221; while holding an animal is an activity that is dangerously close to acting as if the chicken is a korban. That is assur.</li>
<li>Money is just as &#8220;effective&#8221;.</li>
<li>The treatment of the animals before, after and during is often tzaar baalei chaim. Chickens were found wandering the streets of Brooklyn one year after a rain forced the organizers indoors and the chickens were neglected. The unlucky chickens drowned in their cages.</li>
<li>The HUGE chillul Hashem that has occurred in many locations over the last few years. Chickens dying from dehydration, feces and feathers on the street for days after Yom Kippur and other health violations as well.</li>
<li>It looks pagan. Thus it makes Orthodox Judaism look pagan in the eyes of others. This might also qualify as a chillul Hashem.</li>
<li>A diyuk in the Aruch Hashulchan (605:4).</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do we need a diyuk? Because some people don&#8217;t use common sense (1-8) unless there is a &#8220;source&#8221; in a relied upon halachic decisor. So for them&#8230;</p>
<p>Here is the diyuk:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;(Use the chicken that you use for kaparos for your erev Yom Kippur meal or to provide a meal for a poor person.) One is not permitted to search for a WHITE chicken to use for kaparos. This is avoda zara. Whatever one has on hand is what they should use for kaparos.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I think it is fair to say that the Aruch Hashulchan is saying that people were shechting a chicken for the seudah anyway (the same way they would if they would shecht a chicken for any festive meal), they were using a chicken from the backyard. Everyone had chickens that they would use for eggs and eventually for meat, if they wanted to use one of those chickens for kaparos it was okay. However, it was not permissible to seek out a specific chicken (like a white chicken). One was only supposed to use what was on hand.</p>
<p>I think it is likely that the Aruch Hashulchan would prohibit using ANY chickens today when we are ALL seeking a specific chicken as none of us have chickens on hand. The idea was that if you were already shechting a chicken you could add some extra meaning to the procedure by contemplating the irony of the situation. As you were heading to judgment, you were killing a chicken. But for us, who never touch chickens (unless we are shlugging kaparos) are in effect doing just what the Aruch Hashulchan prohibits &#8211; seeking after a chicken for kaparos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="Susan B. Anthony" src="http://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Susan_B_Anthony_Older_Years.png?resize=206%2C287" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />The 19th Amendment gave  women the right to vote in the United States 1920. You can thank Susan B. Anthony (over there on the left) for that one. That was 90 years ago. That right to vote is essential because it gives women a voice in communal matters which directly affect them. It is fundamentally unfair to subject women to laws that are created by agencies that have no responsibility to women by virtue of the fact that women have no say whether they get voted or not.</p>
<p>It is really obvious that women must have the right to vote in a democracy.</p>
<p>An interesting issue has been raised in Crown Heights, the headquarters of Lubavitch and in particular regarding the Crown Heights Jewish Community Council. The CHJCC receives millions of dollars in Federal money and provides a huge amount of social services to local families.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s leadership, like the leadership of many orthodox Jewish organizations, is entirely male. The reason the CHJCC is led my males is actually written into its bylaws. In order to vote, one must be religiously observant, married, previously married or at least 30 years old and male.<span id="more-4143"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear to me if the bylaws prevent a woman from being voted into a leadership position, but that is unlikely given that women cannot vote.</p>
<p>There is a halachic precedent for women not taking religious leadership positions. This has been slightly marginalized in the last century with women taking positions of leadership in religious schools. Certainly, many Jewish organizations that are not religious in nature are permitted halachically to have women and do have women in positions of leadership.</p>
<p>Now, a young man from Chabad is challenging the validity of the male requirement.</p>
<p>Unable to use halacha to justify the rule, CHJCC has used a variety of &#8220;excuses&#8221; to explain the rule. modesty (as per usual), &#8220;tradition&#8221; and maintaining a peaceful marriage are among the reasons given during the discussion over this issue.</p>
<p>The current director conceded that the issue of women voting is being reconsidered by the council. A lawyer for the council has promised that women will be able to vote in the next elections.</p>
<p>Feeling that progress was not being made in private, closed door, conversations, the man challenging the council is considering taking the issue to the courts. Legally speaking, this would not a 19th Amendment issue, rather a 14th Amendment issue, under the equal protection clause. It could apply because the council is accepting Federal funds. It&#8217;s not a very strong case and would likely become a very difficult precedent if it required all organizations accepting a penny of Federal funds to adhere to the strict standards of the constitution regarding separation of church and state as well as the slightly discriminatory policies that many religious organizations may have.</p>
<p>Honestly, the policy really bothers me but I don&#8217;t think they would win a constitutional challenge. Especially not these days&#8230;</p>

It&#8217;s called &#8220;Checking In&#8221;. The idea is simple, whenever you go somewhere significant which you would like to share with others, you &#8220;check in&#8221; on one of those sites and anyone who &#8220;follows you&#8221; can see where you&#8217;ve checked in. You use your smartphone and its built in GPS to check in.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t participate in this effort, but I know plenty of people who do.</p>
<p>You can choose anywhere in the world to check in but only when you there. (I know this is terrible english, I just cannot think of how to write this properly. Sorry.) Some business do give-aways to people who check in and Foursquare keeps track of all check ins at a particular location and the person with the most check ins is the mayor.</p>
<p>A Jewish girl is the mayor of the Al Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. I kid you not.<span id="more-3597"></span></p>
<p>The Temple Mount is one of the most hotly contested plots of land in the world, if not the most contested piece of property. And on Foursquare the dispute has been settled. <img src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png?w=980" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Obviously, her competition for the mayorship is slim. I doubt most of the folks at Al Aqsa Mosque know about Foursquare. But I bet if they find out about it, they will try to get the mayorship for themselves.</p>
<p>In the real world, this accomplishment means absolutely nothing. Yet, it&#8217;s news&#8230;</p>
<p>Check out the article in The New York Observer here: <a href="http://www.observer.com/2010/media/disputed-territories-foursquare-mayors-battle-over-temple-mount">Disputed Territories: Nice Jewish Girl Claims Foursquare Mayorship of Temple Mount</a></p>
<p>The article mentions that orthodox Jews are prohibited from venturing to the Temple Mount. While most orthodox Jews follow this ruling, this is under dispute. Some rabbis do ascend the Temple Mount. Just thought I&#8217;d point that out.</p>

<p>In an article, semi-appropriately named <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/people-of-the-e-book-observant-jews-struggle-with-sabbath-in-a-digital-age/68289/" target="_blank">People of the E-Book? Observant Jews Struggle With Sabbath in a Digital Age</a>, Uri Friedman contemplates the future of e-readers in the hands of orthodox Jews. It&#8217;s only a semi-appropriate headline because I don&#8217;t think many orthodox Jews are actually struggling with this issue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why this is an article worth writing. Orthodox Jews are a tiny segment of the population and do not participate in many rites of popular culture. For some reason, Friedman found this a subject worth writing on.</p>
<p>I have some comments on his article and some thoughts on e-readers as they pertain to orthodox Jews irrespective of the article.</p>
<p>First of all, I am impressed that Friedman knows that some prohibit electricity on Shabbos because of &#8220;boneh&#8221; (building), as you complete a circuit by &#8220;flipping the switch&#8221;. Nice job!<span id="more-3522"></span></p>
<p>The article also draws an interesting parallel between the proliferation of electronic devices and the move to the suburbs in the 50&#8217;s that resulted in a weakening of Shabbos commitment when conservative and reform Jews began driving to Shul in Shabbos.</p>
<p>But something really bothered me. Friedman does a nice job of including thoughts on the subject by orthodox, conservative and reform Jews. What was disturbing is what can be inferred from their quotes.</p>
<p>The first orthodox fellow believes that someone will invent a workaround solution. Since orthodox Jews are so desperate for an Shabbos e-reader someone will surely invent one. Similar to a timed light, the Shabbos e-reader would turn pages at regular intervals. This idea is insane and will never work. (Do I need to explain why this is dumb? Have you ever read a book?) There is no excuse for mentioning this in a respectable article.</p>
<p>The conservative rabbi in the article expresses reservations about using e-readers on Shabbos because they distract from the beauty of Shabbos. This is a noble idea. Unfortunately, most conservative Jews I know, watch TV on Shabbos. An e-reader is not less of a &#8220;distraction&#8221; than TV.</p>
<p>But here is the rub. The orthodox Jew looks like a halachic obsessive who is willing to break the &#8220;spirit of Shabbos&#8221; via an automated e-reader device. The conservative Jew is more concerned about the spiritual parts of Shabbos and even if e-readers are permissible would be sad if they distracted from the &#8220;spirit of Shabbos&#8221;.</p>
<p>I wish the article had not given this impression.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not really true. Orthodox Jews care about the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. That&#8217;s why orthodox Jews don&#8217;t leave their TVs on timers over Shabbos. Some orthodox Jews don&#8217;t use dish washers on timers for the same reason.</p>
<p>To portray the orthodox Jews as those who ignore the spirit of the law is unfair.</p>
<p>As to the issue raised in the article about e-readers and Shabbos. I have resisted buying an e-reader and e-books for a completely different reason.</p>
<p>Most of the books read in my home are from the library. They are free. We don&#8217;t pay $10 for books. Until there is an e-reader subscription where you can read all the books you want for a reasonable monthly fee I cannot imagine paying $200 to have the lucky fortune of buying books for $10 a piece. That is the real reason I am not buying an e-reader. It is true that I read a little more on Shabbos than other days but I read enough during the week that I would love to have an e-reader. I have a nice computer, a Wii, a PS3, an iPod, and iPhone and I only use those during the week too. Who cares?</p>
<p>E-readers are the future. But as long as there is a printing press and people own printers there is no <em>need</em> for orthodox Jews to compromise their commitment to halacha or the spirit of Shabbos.</p>
<p>However, if electricity becomes so ubiquitous that in order to avoid it on Shabbos, orthodox Jews would need to live like the Amish, it is possible that the halachic authorities will reconsider the original decision to consider use of electricity a violation of Shabbos. At that point anything is possible.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to experience a taste of Shabbos with no e-readers, come to the Shul on the Beach where we read from a handwritten Torah scroll and pray from old fashioned books.</p>

<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/08/can-criminals-change-their-ways-introduction-to-the-thief/" target="_blank">Introduction here</a>. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/08/the-thief-part-i-always-a-thief/" target="_blank">Part I here</a>.</p>
<p>Now you know what my life as a thief was like, why I stole and how great it felt. Part II is about my transition from thief to non-thief. My learning of Judaism which caused me to no longer be a thief did not follow a progressive time line. One event did not lead to the next. I do not know in which order I learned which concepts, but it was a conceptual relationship between the ideas, not a temporal one which caused a shift in my outlook and life choices. In addition, at no point in my life (prior to my change) did I ever regret being a thief or have any intention of learning how to fix that part of my personality.</p>
<p>So this section will instead list the various Jewish stories and laws which gave me a new perspective on things. <span id="more-1994"></span>I am not going to quote sources, because I don&#8217;t know them. However, before I begin I will make some philosophical points. Halacha is a set of rules, and because of this I have strong aversion to following them. It is not in my nature to follow rules. Rather, I tend to work around rules. However, unlike most system of rules, Halacha <em>can also be seen as philosophical and moral principles</em>. That is, often when you learn Jewish law you are not /should not be learning a list of do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts, but rather you are learning the boundaries of metaphysical principles as applied to life.</p>
<p>The next section is going to be a rather long look at these boundaries and principles as they apply to theft. For the sake of understanding what I mean though, I will for now just put out another example without proof or argument so that you may have a rough understanding of what I mean. One of the 10 commandments is to give Kavod (honor) to your mother and father. The halachas regarding honoring your parents, doesn&#8217;t teach you what to do or not do for your parents, rather it teaches you in very specific detail, what it means to give kavod to somebody. That is, the 5th commandment to honor your father and mother is a rule that teaches you everything you need to know about honor. How to give it, why to give it, and to whom to give it.</p>
<p>Now onto theft! In no particular order, I learned the following ideas.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.	It is worse to be a thief than a robber. A thief is shamed by other humans, but not by G-d. A robber however is better because they are not even shamed by humans!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.	Theft does not only apply to objects that a person wishes to keep. You can steel sleep, thoughts, time, and even objects that a person is trying to give away.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.	Halacha has very strange rules of what is consider theft and what is not. It also has very strange rules about what you can do with stolen objects. This is not a post about the intricate laws of stealing or robbery, so just take my word for it. But a few brief examples, some stolen items can be used for a mitzvah, while others can not. Another is that a thief who never admits to stealing, does not have to make the 4 or 5 fold penalty payment. Sometimes, when an item is stolen, the object suddenly becomes owner-less, because the owner has given up hope of ever getting it back, and so the thief is allowed to keep the item but not sell it to others. I am certain that I am remembering some of this laws incorrectly as it has been many years since I studied those tractates of the Gemora. Never the less, they are strange, often counter-intuitive and worth exploring in depth if you are interesting in the subject.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4.	There is a midrash (homiletic method of biblical exegesis), that an artist from Moav went to draw Moses&#8217;s face. Each time he came back the “experts” said that he drew the wrong person. The man in the picture is arrogant, selfish, and a tyrant. The Moses they heard of, was humble, giving, and understanding. The picture was of Moses as his inner nature and instinct would have him be. Moses overcame this. The message of the midrash is that it is possible for a person to overcome their natural desires and beyond that, go 180 degrees to turn their greatest weaknesses into their greatest strengths.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5.	A righteous person, it is said, will be able to give a blessing to others, because it is G-d&#8217;s will. That is, a righteous person asks what is already G-d&#8217;s Will, instead of asking G-d to change Its Will to match that of the righteous person.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">6.	There is another saying that theft is the same as idolatry. To steal something is to tell G-d that you do not agree with It&#8217;s allotment of resources and instead you, as the thief, know better than G-d does about who should own what.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">7.	Charity is more important for the person giving it, than for the person receiving it. It is a testament to the understanding of a person&#8217;s role in this world for the “divine plan.”</p>
<p>You might be asking at this point what any of those ideas have to do with anything. How do any of those points change the feelings of excitement and joy from a properly executed theft. How do these ideas counteract the arguments regarding justice and redistribution of wealth. In what manner do these points discredit the idea that if a person does not properly protect their items, they deserve to be stolen?</p>
<p>The answer is, THEY DON&#8217;T! None of these concepts are even remotely related to the reasons why I would steal, would like to steal, or justified stealing. If a person would try to fashion these points into an argument, and suggest that here is a list of reasons why you should not steal, I can and would counter every one of them.</p>
<p>However, what they do instead is teach a new perspective of the world we live in, and a new perspective of my relationship with that world. Basically, theft and stealing are no longer needed. It is counter-productive to steal items. My strong desires to steal items becomes an easy game. There is no reward, no challenge to do what comes naturally. Instead, if I become a person who never steals, not even the slightest&#8230; that becomes a real challenge. That becomes a talent I can harness and grow from. Instead of taking items that I think I deserve, I try to work hard and have those things given to me. Its a tough challenge, but when I succeed it is uplifting. When I look at how I am to give my 10% (charity tithe) to those who can use it, and I accept that those who have things, have them for good reason, I can change my behavior and my attitude in life.</p>
<p>Granted, I still steal today and it&#8217;s something I struggle with. But today, my thefts come from accidentally waking people up when they are sleeping, or stealing time away from my boss, or deceiving bloggers in one way or another. But for a good five years or so maybe more, I was proud of the fact that I never stole a thing from anybody. Not with deceptive words, or with waking people up, or anything. I would not borrow a pen without asking first. I would not dry my hands on a towel without first knowing that I was allowed to use it. I took it upon myself to do true teshuva (repentance) regarding theft, and held myself to the highest of standards. At this point in my life, the stealing of things doesn&#8217;t just feel wrong or immoral, it feels outright counter-productive.</p>
<p>But none of the reasons ever given to me to not steal by other people ever made a dent. It was only through learning many different Jewish topics, that one idea at a time, slowly invaded my mind and changed my personality completely.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear &#8211; <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/08/mesira-informant-in-jewish-law.html" target="_blank">more discussion there</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p>The topic of mesira is complex. I do not claim expertise on the subject of who is a moser, but I have heard a discourse from an expert on Jewish and American Law named <a href="http://www.wsat.org/therav.htm" target="_blank">Rabbi Breitowitz</a>. Aside from teaching law at University of Maryland, Rabbi Breitowitz is a practicing Rabbi in Silver Spring Maryland. When I lived in Baltimore, I heard Rabbi Breitowitz speak on the topic of mesira and I was able to find the same speech online to refresh my memory.</p>
<p>This is my basic understanding of his take on mesira.<span id="more-1000"></span></p>
<p>He mentions three contemporary positions, Reb Moshe Feinstein, the Aruch HaShulchan and Rav Wosner.</p>
<p>He begins with Reb Moshe. Reb Moshe holds that there is a prohibition of mesira when the secular punishment is worse than the Torah&#8217;s punishment. A moser has a halachic status of a rodef, one who is trying to kill another, and must be stopped from his mesira. There are 3 big exceptions. 1) When the person about whom the moser is speaking of is a rodef himself. This is because a person who kills a rodef is not a killer nor is his act of attempting to kill the rodef is not considered a rodef. As an aside, a sexual or physical abuser is considered a halachic rodef and thus there is no prohibition of mesira in those situations. 2) If the moser is preventing a major communal disaster then there is no prohibition. 3) If it one&#8217;s job to inform, then mesira will not apply.</p>
<p>This is the most narrow view of when one is permitted to be moser that Rabbi Breitowitz mentions.</p>
<p>The Aruch Hashulchan says in a footnote to section 318 in Choshen Mishpat that in a benevolent and fair country where there is a justice system that does not unfairly imprison Jews, one is not guilty of mesira by informing the government of a fellow Jew&#8217;s crimes. He continues by saying &#8220;for example in wonderful Czarist Russia&#8221;. There is a question as to the seriousness of this footnote as he could not have possibly meant that Czarist Russia was fair and benevolent. The question is whether the entire footnote has value or if the entire thing was a false gesture of good faith to the Czar. It is not likely that the Aruch Hashulchan would add a deliberately misleading footnote and the reasoning of his footnote stands whether his country was wonderful or not. Thus, the Tzitz Eliezer holds that the Aruch Hashulchan means that wherever there is a &#8220;procedural justice&#8221; there is no mesira.</p>
<p>The third opinion is that of Rav Wosner. His approach integrates the rules of dina d&#8217;malchusa dina with mesira. His reasoning is that when the non-Jews follow the Noachide law of creating a set of laws it becomes a halachic basis for the Jew to obey those laws. Thus, he concludes that it cannot be possible to violate the prohibition of mesira if one is following the laws of their country. Since, he must follow the laws of that country his mesira is not against halacha. This does not mean one is required to be a moser, rather the reporting is not a violation of mesira.</p>
<p>It is necessary to define when dina d&#8217;milchusa dina constitutes to determine when mesira is not prohibited according to Rav Wosner. The Mechaber says that dina d&#8217;malchusa dina is limited to government interests. The Rama disagrees and says that it applies to anything that is designed to promote the well being of society. Most poskim agree with this definition which includes but is not limited to, criminal law, minimum wage laws, environmental laws and child labor laws.</p>
<p>In conclusion, mesira is a term bandied about to protect our own criminals. In reality, it is very difficult to pin down a halachic moser according to the Aruch Hashulchan or Rav Wosner and although it is possible according to Reb Moshe to be a moser it is still unlikely. We need to be honest with ourselves and stop hiding behind archaic halachic terms to justify false ideas.</p>
