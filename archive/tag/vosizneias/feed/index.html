				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Israel, a haredi woman named Ruth Colian is asking that the Israeli government stop funding haredi political parties because they discriminate against women. The haredi parties will not place a woman on their ballots, yet they are receiving money from the government. Colian argues that the government is sponsoring gender discrimination by supporting the patriarchal system of haredi Judaism in politics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good argument and I hope she wins. But that&#8217;s not the issue here.<span id="more-7733"></span></p>
<p>The real issue is that Colian is running as a haredi woman for political office. She won&#8217;t run on a secular list because she says she is haredi. She wants to break the glass ceiling in the haredi community. I wish her luck because it won&#8217;t be easy. In the past, people who tried to change haredi norms were either pushed out or left on their own accord. It&#8217;s an uncomfortable place to be a revolutionary but maybe Colian will be the one.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7735" alt="feminism2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/feminism2-510x600.jpg" /></p>
<p>If she is successful, it will mean yet another avenue that haredi women can achieve the same level of acclaim and success as men. Leaving the rabbinate as one of the few places haredi women cannot. That might prove to be a difficult position to maintain.</p>
<p>Corian is a true haredi feminist. She is haredi and she is vying for equal opportunities for women. This is the basic premise of feminism. It comes in many flavors and textures, but at the heart of all of these feminist movements is a sense that men and women should have equal opportunities and that men should not dictate the role that women must play in society. One can see how feminism and haredi life seem incompatible. While it&#8217;s true that many, if not most, haredi women choose to play the dignified and refined role of mother, wife, and homemaker on the sidelines of religious and communal life, there are many women who would prefer to have a choice to play a more public role in religious and communal life. That is what the haredi feminists want.</p>
<p>When juxtaposed with a trailer for an upcoming documentary on the hasidic community of Brooklyn called Uniforms: The Hasidic #Community, Corian&#8217;s struggle seems even more poignant. The documentary was produced by a self proclaimed non-traditional Jewish woman. She offers a peek into the softer, more spiritual side of Hasidic Judaism. It&#8217;s a noble attempt to show good people living good lives. The public has a negative perception of Hasidic Judaism and this documentary could go a long way to bridging that divide.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the extremely problematic conflation of different hasidic groups in the movie, illustrated by the visuals of chasidim in shtreimels and double head coverings for the women, while hip Chabad people talk about their more liberal way of life, there was a line in the trailer that requires attention.</p>
<p>A woman, who almost certainly is Chabad as betrayed by her perfectly unaccented English, proclaims: <em>&#8220;Jewish [sic] women, we&#8217;re kind of the biggest feminist women out there. Judaism creates space for women to tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I think that if a woman wants to &#8220;tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children&#8221; she should have that opportunity. I am all for traditional values for women that want those values in their lives. It&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s one of the secrets to Orthodox Judaism. In fact, I think it&#8217;s a problem that so many husbands and fathers are studying all day while their wives are leaving the home to support their husbands and babies are being dropped off at day care. I believe the traditional home is a great ideal and bearing children is a wonderful and powerful role to play in this world.</p>
<p>However, it is decidedly not feminist. It can be feminist to choose that life. But if everyone is doing it, or is expected to do it, it does not fit any accepted meaning of the word. You can&#8217;t unilaterally change the entire meaning of the word feminist and apply it to haredi Judaism. It doesn&#8217;t pass the laugh test, forget the smell test.</p>
<p>And why is feminism an ideal for this haredi woman? Why is she trying to pretend that a world where women are not given every opportunity that men are given and they are expected to produce large families is feminist. It&#8217;s not feminist at all. Proudly so! Recently, I heard a prominent rabbi say that Jewish feminists were comparable to reform and conservative Judaism! Orthodox Judaism is not feminist. You need to be okay with that to be orthodox.</p>
<p>In Israel, Ruth Corian is dying for the opportunity to lead her community. She is a feminist. In Brooklyn the party line is apparently that being a mom is the most feminist thing one can do.</p>
<p>Again, I am not degrading moms. God forbid! I think it&#8217;s a great choice if one can and one wants to make it. But it&#8217;s not feminist if that is what is expected. But even more perplexing is why are you trying to call it feminist?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is an isolated incident. I&#8217;ve seen this more and more often. People are selling Orthodox Judaism as feminist. I&#8217;m a pretty liberal Orthodox Jew and I don&#8217;t see how anyone could interpret my religion as feminist.</p>
<p>Personally, it bothers me. I grapple with it. I struggle with the current inequality and I empathize with those orthodox Jewish women who want to play a more prominent public role. I wish Orthodox Judaism had more feminist opportunities. I do my best to accommodate feminism within tradition. But I don&#8217;t redefine the term to conform to my orthodox worldview. Words have meaning and that meaning must be respected.</p>
<p>It seems impossible, if not extremely unlikely, that orthodox Judaism will ever have equal opportunities for men and women. Maybe that&#8217;s okay. Not every religion or creed has to conform with every modern sensibility. But let&#8217;s at least be honest about it. And if we can, try to break as many glass ceilings that we can shatter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Burning-book-001-450x270.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6535" title="Burning-book-001-450x270" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Burning-book-001-450x270-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a>Books were one of the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Personal Torah libraries in private homes and public Torah libraries in institutions were irreparably damaged by the raging waters.</p>
<p>The Jewish people are the People of the Book and our books are revered. We don&#8217;t simply learn from books, we treat books with respect and (in a non-creepy way), we almost give them the respect an important person would receive. Books are kissed when we put them away, we don&#8217;t leave our books open when we are not studying, we prominently display our books in our homes, we spend time each day studying the books, and when books are no longer able to be used we bury the books. Our books have been burned by our enemies and we cry over those tragedies almost as we would cry over human death. We have burned our own books and we regret those incidents. Our books are precious and we are very aware of their importance in our lives.</p>
<p>A huge number of books were destroyed in the hurricane. They deserved a proper send-off and at Yeshiva Darchei Torah in Far Rockaway the books received an appropriate farewell. The students and rabbis participated in a ceremonial funeral as they sent the books to be buried.<span id="more-6531"></span></p>
<p>The unspoken message to the students and the rabbis and to the rest of us is that our books are the basic building blocks of Judaism. In our books, the words of our Torah scholars live on and in turn they give us life. While Judaism cannot be relegated to an encyclopedia, instead it must be lived and alive. The pursuit of Torah knowledge and expertise in order to live that life is so vital to our success that the books themselves are larger than life. The books deserve our respect and our attention. We can never forget that we are called the people of the book and we must earn the title by doing our very best to know what it says in our books.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tiferes-592x394.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6389" title="tiferes-592x394" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tiferes-592x394-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>WNYC ran a three part series on Professional Development. One segment of the series featured a profile on an all girls, chasidic school in Williamsburg NY with incredible standardized test scores.</p>
<p>According to the radio segment, the success of the school is mostly a result of their teacher training. The school hires young women who are 18 or 19 years old and trains them to teach with excellence. The teachers make $6000 a year and have no formal educational training.</p>
<p>The mastermind behind this is a chasidic woman named Miriam Amsel. She personally trains the teachers and helps them succeed with regular development meetings. During the sessions she helps the teachers grow in their skills and techniques. It is key that the teachers buy into her wisdom and they hang onto her every word. She offers this amazing quote during the radio segment:<span id="more-6387"></span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;</em><em>Success is never the result of having all the answers. It is the result of being open for all the questions.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>That is a great lesson. In fact the story on the WNYC website &#8220;Questions Lead Way in One School&#8217;s Teacher Training&#8221;. I am sure she means it as well. But in the ultra-orthodox community this does not seem to be the norm. Some questions are allowed. Other questions are decidedly out of bounds.</p>
<p>I am amazed at the success of this school and I think anyone would be equally impressed with the scores of these girls, especially in English which is their second language.</p>
<p>The article on WNYC&#8217;s site highlights two more factors in the school&#8217;s success:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Unlike at the city’s public schools, college and career readiness are not the focus at Tiferes Bnos because Hasidic society strongly discourages its members from attending college. Nevertheless, Amsel and her teachers say that for their girls, a good education is important so they can be productive and thoughtful members of the community.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many elements of success at the private school would not be easy to replicate in a public school: The students, as members of the insular Hasidic community, are mostly sheltered from the distractions, like television and video games, and problems, like single-parent homes, that many low-income students in public schools face. Girls as a group tend to do better academically than boys. And the songs Tiferes Bnos teachers sing to build cohesiveness and raise morale are not likely to catch on in the city’s public schools.</em></p>
<p>I agree that education is important. But I also think education should not stop when one graduates high school. I also wonder what the science education is like. I also wonder what these young women are doing with their education if they are not continuing on to higher education.</p>
<p>I also agree that distractions are just that, distractions. But I am not convinced that taking away all distractions is good for children in the long run. It may produce better test scores. But does it produce better people? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>There is some skepticism over these scores. As a skeptical person, I am very curious how these tests are administered in this school. I am not accusing them of cheating or fixing the scores. But I would be much more confident if the scores could be independently verified. If only just to ease my conscience.</p>
<p>Another thing that bothers me a little bit about the article is its portrayal of the school as catering to low-income families. While it is true that the families in the school are low-income, they are not subject to the same sort of conditions and circumstances as the children of other low-income families and areas. Family life is revered. There is a community safety net. Further, a lot of the families in the community are low-income by choice and they live a more than half decent lifestyle. Parents chip in and the government subsidies are leveraged to the maximum. Other low-income schools and communities do not enjoy such luxuries so perhaps the metric should not be income, rather it should be family stability, crime rates, and comfort of living.</p>
<p>I also fear that this incredible accomplishment will be viewed as vindication for all charedi schools. Clearly, education is not that great in most ultra-orthodox schools. This school is an exception that proves the rule. Just because they can do it somehow does not mean that all schools are capable of pulling off this kind of success, especially with young teachers with no professional degrees. It speaks to the incredible talents of Mrs. Amsel, but there is a reason she is singled out as an exceptions; she is exceptional.</p>
<p>In all, the school is making a great Kiddush Hashem and I am very happy to learn of the great test scores in this school. <em>Kein yirbu.</em></p>

The conversation was mostly about the Jewish court system that we have in place today. R&#8217; Schachter expressed deep reservations about the Beis Din system.</p>
<p>He exposed corruption and wrongdoing within the system. He didn&#8217;t pull punches and he spoke with the authority of a true Torah giant with a lifetime of personal experience. The article was a bit of a sensation. His opening salvo: &#8220;<em>The present system is terrible.&#8221;</em> From there, R&#8217; Schachter spoke from personal experience about the flaws, inadequacies, and corruption in the system.</p>
<p>Here a few choice quotes:<span id="more-5404"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Q:</strong> Are you saying there is a problem with the dayanim? </em><br />
<em><strong>A:</strong> Of course. Do you think that all of the dayanim are honest? Many are acting like toanim; many of the toanim are acting like criminals. They make up their minds in advance that their side has to win,</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Q: </strong>Could there be a watchdog group, with rabbanim getting together to examine how the batei din are behaving? </em><br />
<em><strong>A:</strong> It’s a safek sakana [possible danger] for the watchdog group; they’re going to be killed.</em></p>
<p>Are all batei din corrupt? Probably not. So how are the good batei din supposed to separate their courts? How will people know which courts are honest? Is there a way to become more transparent?</p>
<p>I think this is the motivation behind a journal that found its way to my mailbox this week. The Journal of the Beth Din of America is a new publication that I believe was created to set itself apart from the the negative stereotypes illustrated by R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p>From the introduction to the first edition:</p>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Yet despite a well earned reputation for adjudicating cases fairly, efficiently and competently, the public lacks a full understanding and appreciation for much of the work of the Beth Din of America. This is because, like all batei din, the Beth Din is committed to confidentiality for the individuals, families and firms that utilize its services. Unlike secular court decisions which are published and accessible, beit din arbitration awards are provided only to parties and their legal counsel.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The publication of The Journal of the Beth Din of America is an attempt to change this situation, and educate the public about Jewish law as applied in a beit din, with particular attention to the outlook and practices of the Beth Din of America. The journal will primarily feature articles by dayanim of the Beth Din of America and other contributors. In each issue, we also hope to publish decisions actually rendered by the Beth Din of America (appropriately anonymized and approved for publication by the parties).</em></p>
<p>I think this is great. The journal features several types of articles. The articles are great for their content. Even if there was no side benefit other than to increase Torah study and wisdom, the journal is great. Most importantly, decisions of the Beth Din of America will be published after being anonymized. This will increase the Beth Din of America&#8217;s credibility as their decisions will be transparent and available for all to see. Further, it will either expose other Batei Din as closed walls with less accountability and hopefully it will incentivize them to clean up their acts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small step, but an important step in the right direction. Kudos to the Beth Din of America.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kosher-pork-233.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4488" title="kosher-pork-233" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kosher-pork-233.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="288" /></a>You may have heard about the humorous mix-up that led to some pork being labeled as kosher. Yes. You heard right. The pork was not actually kosher, it was mislabeled. It would have been hard to fool somebody as it clearly said &#8220;pork&#8221; on the label.</p>
<p>The usual suspects among the orthodox Jewish blogs tab articles on the mix-up and the comments ran the gamut from incensed to amused and from serious to satire.</p>
<p>One might like to think that these comments, sometimes lucid, frequently enlightening, often written in broken English, other times written with contempt for the outside world remain within the virtual box of orthodox Judaism. This is not the case.<span id="more-4487"></span></p>
<p>I have heard from prominent people who work within the interfaith community that these orthodox Jewish new sites are monitored and mined. Our comments are being read by anyone who is interested and many are interested.</p>
<p>Our news sites, especially <a href="vosizneias.com" target="_blank">Vosizneias</a> have been quoted in the mainstream press and even comments have been noticed or quoted in the press.</p>
<p>The New Yorker, which I don&#8217;t read, mostly because when I do, I haven&#8217;t the foggiest idea what they are talking about, ran a story on the reactions to the kosher pork mix-up. I was able to understand this article. It has the highbrow humor that I usually don&#8217;t get, but since I know all about the kosher pork, I think I was able to follow.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was informed about this article because someone found it offensive. I did not. You can read it and let me know if you think it is offensive to orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>But I am more concerned with two much more important issues.</p>
<p>1) Our comments on VIN and other similar sites are being monitored. It behooves the commenters and the moderators of these sites to be sure that nothing that is published will harm relationships between Jews (orthodox or not) and non-Jews (and also between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews). I have a feeling that many commenters assume that their words are sealed within the vacuum of the orthodox Jewish world. They are not. Many of the remarks may not be sincere, they just be flip, but they can read the wrong way and they are being read.</p>
<p>2) Our English is horrible. The New Yorker copied and pasted random comments into their article. The comments sound like English is the second language of their authors. For many it is, but isn&#8217;t it time that all orthodox Jews living in America learned basic English? Would it not be better for Klal Yisrael if we could express ourselves in a respectful articulate manner? I think so.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy the article. It is a bit humorous and for once we can all read a New Yorker article and understand the context. And please be careful about what you write online and how it is written.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/israel_flag1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2055" title="CB015977" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/israel_flag-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="168" /></a>Last year, there were a large number of public incidents that shed a negative light on Jews in general and particularly on Orthodox Jews. These events were not representitive of the average Jewish person, yet their notoriety put them front and center in the media.</p>
<p>It seems that the Earthquake in Haiti has marked a reversal of negative media coverage into more positive media coverage in response to more positive actions by Jewish people.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/14/jewish-relief-efforts-for-haiti-earthquake-victims/" target="_blank">I noted last week that although the Jewish connection with Haiti is slim, there has been no shortage of Jewish efforts to aid the beleaguered people of Haiti.</a></p>
<p>It did not end with financial support.<span id="more-2047"></span> CNN has been reporting that the Israeli relief efforts were the quickest to respond and efforts were in full swing before any other country was set up. Israel was the first country with a field hospital in Haiti,  Additionaly, the Israeli relief efforts have been reported as effective and efficient by CNN and others.</p>
<p>You can see video below of CNN&#8217;s coverage.</p>
<p>I am also proud to report that my uncle made the news with his personal work on behalf of Haiti.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/47393/2010/01/20/monsey-ny-orthodox-community-leaders-meet-with-haitian-neighbors" target="_blank">Vosizneias is reporting</a> that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CD4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRonald_Greenwald&amp;ei=YkBXS5-iC4_EsQOCuqjGBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNES7nAkD6cORVmLylE121IZ1SC1-w&amp;sig2=E4ITL5bQQh41BJxz7MDJnQ" target="_blank">Rabbi Ronald Greenwald</a> (Uncle Ronnie, to me) is spearheading a drive in many Monsey NY private Jewish schools (Yeshivas) to collect food and supplies to be delivered to Haiti. This comes on the heels of an unrelated visit to Haiti 6 weeks prior in which he was inspired to help the impoverished nation. Greenwald promised the members of the the Haitian community that he would meet with them and accompany them on a delegation to Washington if needed. That meeting was scheduled for January 19.</p>
<p>Uncle Ronnie is no stranger to projects of this nature. He has spent his entire adult life working on behalf of Jewish and non-Jewish causes. Those who know him or know of him are not surprised by this news. The only thing surprising is that some people think it is &#8220;news&#8221;. This is a typical anecdote in his accomplished life and we wish him more opportunities and more success for many years to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1807" href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/08/gatorade-becoming-kosher-drops-tiger-woods-from-endorsements/tiger2/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1807" title="tiger gatorade focus" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/tiger2-148x300.jpg" alt="tiger gatorade focus" width="104" height="210" /></a>In the last few weeks Gatorade has been in the news for two separate reasons. One relates to its kosher certification and one relates to an endorsement deal with a famous athlete.</p>
<p>Is there a connection?</p>
[Disclaimer: Please read the rest of this post tongue-in-cheek. I'm no expert on writing in general and certainly not humorous writing. This post is intended to be 13% information and 87% light hearted banter.]
<p>About six weeks ago <a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/39737/2009/10/14/new-york-report-tootsie-roll-gatorade-to-get-major-kosher-certification/" target="_blank">it was reported that Gatorade (and Tootsie Rolls) was going to become kosher</a> (VIN). <span id="more-1806"></span>This means that a kosher supervising agency will verify that the ingredients and machinery used in Gatorade do not contain any non-Kosher ingredients. They will monitor the production of the plant and will place their stamp of approval on the product. Jewish consumers who do not eat food or drink without a kosher symbol verification will now be able to drink Gatorade. Isn&#8217;t that exciting?</p>
<p>I wondered, as anybody else who keeps kosher, if Gatorade will need to adjust their formula or if the certification just verifies that the elixir was kosher all along&#8230; I am afraid I will never know.</p>
<p>The word kosher is commonly used to refer to food items and whether they are technically allowed to be eaten by kosher observant Jews. But the truth is that kosher means much more than that. The word means &#8220;fit&#8221; and it applies to any and everything. The word kosher can be used as a replacement for &#8220;appropriate&#8221; or &#8220;okay&#8221; in situations besides the typical food usage. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/19/kosher-navigation/" target="_blank">I wrote about this in the early stages of the blog when the Kosher GPS was announced.</a></p>
<p>It turns out that Gatorade may or may not have needed to make their formual kosher. But they did need to make their endorsements kosher.</p>
<p>Gatorade announced today that they are dropping Tiger Woods as a spokesperson for their product. The company will discontinue the Tiger Focus drink. It is being reported that the decision to drop Tiger preceded his current brouhaha involving the many women in his personal life. According to ABC News, a publication was informed of this decision 2 days prior to the initial incident at Tiger Woods&#8217; home. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9283979" target="_blank">You can read the AP story on ABC News</a>.</p>
<p>All this means to me is that Gatorade knew about the women and personal problems before we did.</p>
<p>More importantly, Gatorade wants to project a more kosher image across the board. Their drink will have the kosher certification and their spokesperson roster will not include the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/02/the-eye-of-the-tiger-fans/" target="_blank">latest sports villain, Tiger Woods</a>.</p>
<p>Gatorade becoming kosher to drink and dropping Tiger Woods? Most definitely NOT a coincidence&#8230;</p>

An article on Ynet.com featured on VIN caught my ire this afternoon.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<div><span style="color:#336666;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/07/guest-pos-t-by-e.html" target="_blank"><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear &#8211; more discussion there.</em></a></strong></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/35376/2009/07/21/jerusalem-religious-large-families-are-joy-ignore-the-evil-feminist-anti-motherhood-terror/">An article on Ynet.com featured on VIN caught my ire this afternoon.</a></span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">The writer, a woman, calls upon all Orthodox Jews to reject &#8220;the evil feminists&#8221; of Kolech and &#8220;have as many children as possible, as soon as possible&#8221;. For there is no greater joy in life than having many children.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Her arguments are weak (read it for yourself) and the ending says it all: &#8220;Trust me&#8221;. Why should I trust her?</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">As a proud father of 2 beautiful boys (a 6 year old and 8 month old) I can attest to the joys of parenthood. Giving the gift of life to one&#8217;s offspring is both very powerful and oftentimes emotional. I cannot imagine my life without my family.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">I must take issue with this woman&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;the greatest gift we can give our families is a big family. Very big&#8221;.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><span id="more-888"></span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">In the VIN comments, there is a quote from R&#8217; Shlomo Zalman Aurbach. When approached with a shaila regarding a woman who had 6 children and suffered a nervous breakdown for a heter to use birth control. His response, &#8220;why are you asking me, ask the Rav who gave her a heter to have 6 children in the first place!?&#8221;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Reb Moshe Feinstein writes in his Tshuvos that if the mother would suffer any physical, psychological or emotional harm from bearing more children she must use birth control.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><span style="font-style:italic;"></p>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Having a large family is not rooted in halacha. It is rooted in a social pressure to conform.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<p></span></span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">What has happened is the children of the &#8220;survivors&#8221; and that generation had a social calling to have large families. They were able to bear it (for the most part) with a low cost of living and 9-5 jobs, leaving time and money to spare. Enough to support many of those children in Kollel.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">For many people pregnancy and childbirth as well as child rearing are difficult. For many families the cost of living is too high to support a large family. Work hours are long and the money does not go as far as it used to go.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Today&#8217;s society requires different approaches to life&#8217;s challenges from previous generations. The cost of living is higher. This forces most families to need a dual income. Who is going to raise these large families? What about the marriages? Husbands and wives who work full time, come home tired with children who need their time and attention. The idea of marriage in Judaism is to develop a relationship with a significant other. This cannot be ignored either!</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Our schools are suffering from unprecedented deficits and budget cutting. Parents are having a hard time paying the tuition bills. Large families may be all of &#8220;your joy&#8221; but they can be an unfair burden on the tzibbur.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">I am not calling for a &#8220;child cap&#8221; ala China. I am saying use your sechel and please don&#8217;t tell me what is good for you is good for everyone. Please don&#8217;t preach to me about what you think is right when it is not based on halacha.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Bitachon does not allow for recklessness. We cannot overburden ourselves or the system and expect bitachon to bail us out. There are children of large families who I know resented the lack of attention they received, the handouts they needed and the hustle and bustle of their busy homes. Those parents were likely ill equipped to deal with the large family dynamics and their children felt it.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="font-style:normal;">Also, I happen to think that there are folks who have lots of kids to distract themselves from their unhappy lives, or their unhappy marriages (yes like a drug). Those folks need help. Not bigger families.</span></div>

<p>The<a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/35083/2009/07/15/new-york-baalei-teshuva-turned-off-by-e2809cfrume2809d-people-engaging-in-corrupt-behavior/" target="_blank"> column I read was a great perpective on Baal Teshuvas</a> and their integration into the Frum community. In particular the column focused on various reactions of the BT (I use the term adoringly) when encountered with other (supposedly) Frum Jews who are not living up to their own standards.</p>
<p><span id="more-872"></span>Some BTs &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmNopAo0PRc&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">can&#8217;t handle the truth</a>&#8221; and wind up right where they started &#8211; wonderful secular people. Other BTs are more adept at maintaining their Frum lifestyle despite the disappointment. The article then enumerates some of the great things that BTs have contributed to the Frum lifestyle. Like manners, healthy eating, special education, etc.</p>
<p>While there is room for debate on whether the Frum community can attribute these &#8220;innovations&#8221; to BTs I am happy to give them the credit.</p>
<p>The article concludes by thanking the Frum community for showing them a way of life they love and appreciate.</p>
<p>I have two main points that I want to make in relation to this article.</p>
<p>1- The fake sales pitch the Frum From Birth Kiruv Rabbis spew.</p>
<p>2- The BTs reaction to the reality check.</p>
<p>I cannot stand the sales pitch that Frum people have no problems and Torah life is free from all social ills. It is simply not accurate. Please don&#8217;t use it!</p>
<p>In fact, the Torah is a guidebook for flawed people. If people were able to just become perfect then the Torah would give us one time instructions to &#8220;fix&#8221; our flaws and then we would be good to go! But instead, the Torah gives us instructions to develop our character through Mitzva observance with specific tasks. Some tasks only come around once in a lifetime, or once every 50 years, or once every seven years, or once a year, or once a month, once a week, once a day, and even every second. The clear message is that we need constant work because humans will eventually fall.</p>
<p>The Talmud explicitly states: &#8220;Do not believe in yourself (righteousness) until the day you die&#8221;. The human being is designed to fail without constant work and guidance.</p>
<p>I believe the honest sales pitch (and yes it is a sales pitch and that&#8217;s okay) is: Humans are flawed, we all need guidance, the Torah provides guidance. Some of it is obvious, some of it is hidden, but we believe that the Torah lifestyle is a guide for life. If you want a guide, you can buy in. We are all trying to use the guide as best as we can and we feel our lives are more enriched by using the guide. Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important is the reaction of the BT. I sent this email to <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/juddmag" target="_blank">Judd Magilnick</a>, a<a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank"> Pacific Jewish Center</a> board member and he offered some great insight.</p>
<p>First, many &#8220;not yet&#8221; BTs back off from greater commitment by rationalizing that they saw a Frum person who lacked derech eretz (common courtesy). Judd says this is the Yetzer Hara talking but Frum folks need to realize that they are being judged and should act accordingly.</p>
<p>I once heard that R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein asked why we ask in Ahava Rabba that Hashem give us the ability to understand, listen to and teach Torah. Should the teaching part be reserved for teachers and rabbis? Why does veryone say it? And R&#8217; Moshe answers that we are all teachers. We are teaching others about how the Torah wants us to behave every time we act.</p>
<p>Judd&#8217;s next point was even better. Why should an impious Frum person affect one&#8217;s opinion of Torah? The analogy is if one sticks his wet finger in a socket he is going to get a shock. That doesn&#8217;t indicate a flaw in elecricity! And like electricity Torah has the power to do great good and it also has the power to cause ill. It depends on its user.</p>
<p>So (potential) BTs, if you can use Torah for good why would you let it bother you that someone else is abusing it? One has nothing to do with the other!</p>
<p>As a Rabbi in shul of mostly BTs and potential BTs I hear this kind of rhetoric often. &#8220;If he&#8217;s a Frum person he shouldn&#8217;t do X or Y etc&#8221;. It is disheartening but I have one response.</p>
<p>I always quote Rabbi Wein: &#8220;Don&#8217;t judge Judaism by its Jews&#8221;.</p>
<p>Additionally, I don&#8217;t <em>pitch</em> anything other that learning more Torah and experiencing a Shabbos meal. One should make their personal decisions based on an informed view that can only come from one&#8217;s own study. The Shabbos meal is just to make it a little more personal and less abstract. That&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>So, I am looking for insight, do people really judge Torah by its Jews?</p>
<p>Is there an &#8220;accurate&#8221; (non-cynical) sales pitch?</p>
<p>Anything else in the original column that struck you?</p>
