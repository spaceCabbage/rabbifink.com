				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7319" alt="images" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images.jpeg" width="275" height="183" /></a>The USA Today reports that there are some orthodox Jews who will watch fireworks tonight with no sound. Seeing as this year the 4th of July is during the 3 Weeks between Shiva Asar B&#8217;Tamuz and Tisha B&#8217;Av there are some elements of mourning that are customary during this period. Many orthodox Jews refrain from listening to music as part of their mourning these 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Fireworks are often accompanied by music. Journalist Menachem Wecker was curious if the music accompaniment would cause some orthodox Jews to forgo the usual fireworks celebrations.</p>
<p>There are probably very few orthodox Jews who care about July 4th who also would be so stringent about the 3 weeks that they would not even listen to background music. Of those who are that stringent, very few would care to participate in July 4th festivities.<span id="more-7318"></span></p>
<p>Are there any orthodox Jews who will avoid places that have music in the background? What do they do if they get put on hold? Radio advertisement jingles? Cell phone ring tones? Singing toddler toys? That <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQT9K_nkeVQ" target="_blank">awesome music that plays when you start Windows 2000</a>? Obviously these questions are absurd. The real prohibition is against live music and celebration. Most orthodox Jews extend that to recored music as well. But I don&#8217;t think there are many people who avoid music at all costs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I told Menachem Wecker when he talked with me about this issue and then I was quoted in his article.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the headline though. It kind of says the opposite of what the article says.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, if a July 4th celebration would interfere with one&#8217;s observance of the appropriate level of mourning at this time of year, I think one should make their own decision to refrain from celebrating. I don&#8217;t that would apply to many people, but out first allegiance is to Torah, then and only then do we pledge allegiance to the flag.</p>
<p>Enjoy the holiday. Happy birthday America!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JPA103R-FRANCE-_1386245cl-8.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5288" title="JPA103R-FRANCE-_1386245cl-8" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JPA103R-FRANCE-_1386245cl-8-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>Tragedy struck the French Jewish community today. An unidentified gunman shot several people outside a Jewish school. When Jewish people are suffering anywhere in the world, Jews all over the rest of the world suffer with them. It is a great testament to our unity and sense of camaraderie that we can feel the pain of our Jewish brethren though we have never met.</p>
<p>Death, especially sudden death, inflicts a wound upon the survivors. When a fellow Jew is killed we are all survivors. For now, the pain is being channeled into grief and connection. Jews all over the world are expressing their solidarity and love for the victims, their families, and the entire French Jewish community.</p>
<p>When Jews are killed, another reasonable reaction is to immediately assume that anti-Semitism is a factor.<span id="more-5287"></span> This is turn, gets channeled into fervent Zionism, and sometimes translates into sympathy for movements like the JDL. I can understand these sentiments. With our collective history, it is absolutely a natural reaction.</p>
<p>With regard to this recent tragedy, there is no evidence of ant-Semitism. Complicating matters further is the forensic evidence that shows that other shootings in the area in the last few days were committed using the same weapon. The other shootings targeted French paratroopers of non-Jewish ethnicity. The modus operandi was also the same. A man on a motorcycle fired shots and then sped away.</p>
<p>To my untrained mind, it seems that the same man is the shooter. If that is the case, it is even harder to see anti-Semitism in today&#8217;s horrible tragedy.</p>
<p>I think it is slightly irresponsible to blame anti-Semitism when there is none. I understand that it is a natural reaction. But anti-Semitism cannot be presumed in any and every instance where Jewish people are killed. There may turn out to be anti-Semitism in this case. But at this point, I can&#8217;t see how that can be assumed.</p>
<p>Also, slightly cringeworthy is the <em>&#8220;may God avenge their blood&#8221;</em> sentiment. We can mourn and express pain without being bloodthirsty in our expressions.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let us mourn responsibly. Let us mourn these deaths as one. We are in a deep collective pain. Let us channel that pain to improving the world and increasing love and kindness in the world to properly avenge the death of our brothers and sister in France.</p>
<p><em>May their memories be for a blessing.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Deion+Sanders+Shannon+Sharpe+oxdD_wsPVTjm.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4498" title="Deion+Sanders+Shannon+Sharpe" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Deion+Sanders+Shannon+Sharpe+oxdD_wsPVTjm-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Over the weekend, NFL greats, Deion Sanders and Shannon Sharpe were inducted into the National Football League Hall of Fame among others. These two men are famous for their on the field accomplishments as well as their gifts of speech. Both Sanders and Sharpe have had successful careers as commentators and for good reason. These guys can talk.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that their induction speeches were highly anticipated.</p>
<p>The reviews of their speeches are in and they are mixed. I am not going to grade their performances, but I do have something to say about the content of their speeches.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2011/8/8/2349026/deion-sanders-shannon-sharpe-pro-football-hall-of-fame-speech" target="_blank">Both spent considerable time talking about their childhood</a>. They both came from poor, disadvantaged homes. Both were slightly embarrassed by their upbringing. More importantly, both credited their difficult youth as motivation to succeed in the NFL. They wanted &#8220;out&#8221; so badly that were willing to do whatever it took to become the best players they could be.<span id="more-4497"></span> Luckily for them, they made it.</p>
<p>It seemed from their words that despite all their success, the pain and agony of their childhood has not been assuaged by their mammoth success. They still feel the trauma of their early years even though they made it out. And they made it out in a huge way.</p>
<p>It takes a lot to overcome adversity. Overcoming difficult circumstances is also a tremendous motivator. There are few forces that drive a person to success more than necessity. The need to get out is so powerful that it provides super talented people with a glimmer of hope that they can escape their hellish lives.</p>
<p>People born with less adversity are harder to motivate. Why work as hard when life is easy? Why try to change things if things are just dandy? There are far fewer professional athletes from wealthy homes than from tough neighborhoods. It is simple to understand. When you need a ticket out, you&#8217;ll do anything you can to punch that ticket.</p>
<p>For Ashkenazik Jews, our current predicament is unfamiliar. For hundreds of years we have been victims. Violence, segregation, ostracization and victimization described our existence. It boiled over during the Holocaust but was horrible many times and for many years before the Holocaust as well.</p>
<p>For all those years we desperately wanted to get out. Tisha B&#8217;Av was easy to feel. Our lives were so difficult and our situations were so dire that it motivated us to experience Tisha B&#8217;Av with tears and genuine desire for our Temple to be rebuilt. Our daily existence justified an intense desire to &#8220;make the new days into the days of old&#8221;.</p>
<p>There was a transitional period as Jews made their way to America. My great-grandfather quit his job every Friday because he refused to work on Shabbos. Eventually, his sisters kicked him out of his home. That was America in the early days.</p>
<p>But now we are comfortable. We have come a long way. Jews live middle to upper class lives in America. We have religious freedom. Kosher food is ubiquitous. We can visit all the important places in the Land of Israel. It is easy to study Torah. We have it good. Real good. Maybe too good.</p>
<p>Where is our motivation?</p>
<p>How are we to work up the emotions necessary to feel Tisha B&#8217;Av?</p>
<p>It can be tough.</p>
<p>I propose that as hard and as painful as it may be, we should contemplate the social issues that plague Judaism. We need to consider the difficulty of the orthodox and especially non-orthodox communities in maintaining our religious identity in such a free world. We can think about how freedom has given rise to a slew of new, first world problems.</p>
<p>What I am saying, is we should look as critically as we can at contemporary Judaism. Even though the glass is much more than half full and for 353 days a year we need to appreciate our good fortune, on Tisha B&#8217;Av we need to look at the glass as almost completely empty.</p>
<p>That is what we are mourning. We don&#8217;t have it all. And we want it all.</p>
<p>Once a year we can focus on the negative. We can remind ourselves that although we are much more advantaged than our grandparents were, we are still a desolate nation living at best, a halfway existence.</p>
<p>It can be hard to do. But no one said Tisha B&#8217;Av was supposed to be easy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have not been to a lot of funerals in my life. I have been blessed.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening my family celebrated Sheva Brachos for a cousin in my parents home. It was a joyous occasion.</p>
<p>Immediately following its conclusion, I walked the 200 feet from my parent&#8217;s home to the neighborhood shul. At about 11:00 PM a very moving funeral began.</p>
<p>The juxtaposition of these two events and the nature of the deceased brought tremendous emotion. What follows is an attempt to do those feelings justice in writing.</p>
<p><span id="more-924"></span>When I was 12 my family moved to a fledgling Monsey community, our sole neighbors up the block were the Glucks.</p>
<p>Blessed with wonderful children, the Glucks were proud and humble people. Performing anonymous kindnesses was a hallmark of their lives.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, tragedy struck a few short years ago when Mrs. Gluck was taken from this world. The tragedy shook up the neighborhood. It was one the my parent&#8217;s first contemporaries death and it was painful for everyone.</p>
<p>The Glucks were resilient. They bounced back. The children were successful in achieving their goals and Mr. Gluck, Moish (George) Gluck remarries.</p>
<p>Yesterday, tragedy struck again. Driving home from work, Moish Gluck suffered a fatal heart attack, literally yards away from his home.</p>
<p>The pain is indescribable. Four surviving children under 30. The oldest was my classmate. The youngest my sister&#8217;s age. A recently married widow. A community still reeling from the untimely departure of Mrs. Gluck, now struck again is left to help repair their torn hearts and help the family pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>Listening to the youngest Gluck eulogize his father last night was one of the most emotionally difficult moments of my life. The cracking in his voice, coupled with his eloquent words were too much for me to bear. I cried. Tears were streaming down my face. It was the first time I have cried freely at a funeral in my life.</p>
<p>I, as countless others, my father included, owe Moish Gluck tremendous gratitude for a variety of things. In my case, the gratitude I have for Moish Gluck directly correlates to my profession as a Rabbi and a teacher. The mere fact that you are reading this post, is somewhat due to Moish Gluck.</p>
<p>Moish Gluck was my first employer. As a 12 year old neighborhood kid, Moish Gluck gave me my first opportunity to teach. Their eldest son needed someone to study Mishna with him. I was asked, and given a fair remuneration for my time.</p>
<p>I will never forget preparing for those sessions. Teaching Torah to the boy who was just 3 years my junior, was my first taste of the joys of teaching, and I will never forget that. I will never forget the smile on the boy&#8217;s parents faces when they gave me my monthly stipend. I will never forget the encouragement that Moish Gluck gave me, in the face of my first challenge to teach.</p>
<p>It must have been a good experience as since then I have been teaching in many capacities. As a Campus Rabbi, as a High School adviser for Yeshiva Students and Public School Students, and now as the Rabbi of the Pacific Jewish Center I draw upon my first moments as a teacher. All directly caused by a man whose friends and neighbors will all miss, Moish Gluck.</p>
<p>If this post were on paper and the words written in ink, my tears would stain the paper instead of falling onto the desk from where I type.</p>
<p>Let us remember to cherish the ones we love. Let us enjoy each second we spend with the people we care for most. Let us not waste the opportunities we have for love and friendship.</p>
<p>It was too difficult for my ears to hear a loving son pine for one more moment with his precious father. If we have those moments let us treasure them.</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#888888;">May the Lord comfort us amongst the mourners of Zion.</span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/36108/2009/08/03/queens-ny-last-of-gedolei-hador-rav-zelik-epstein-ztl-passes-away/" target="_blank">the Jewish world lost a spiritual giant</a> (good article worth reading). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelik_Epstein" target="_blank">Rabbi Zelik Epstein</a>, Rosh Yeshiva of Shaar Hatorah in Queens passed away. He was 97.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Zelik was a relic of the past. He studied Torah in Europe with some the greatest Torah scholars of recent American Jewry, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein" target="_blank">Rabbi Moshe </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein" target="_blank">Feinstein</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Kamenetsky" target="_blank">Rabbi Yaakov Kamanetsky</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more significantly, he was above the fray. He did not get involved in politics and instead, studied, taught and advised and preached Torah and its values.</p>
<p><span id="more-923"></span>Today the Jewish community mourns a man of integrity, scholarship and clarity.</p>
<p>Today, I mourn a man who taught my grandfather, Sidney Greenwald, over 50 years ago in the fledgling Beis Medrash Elyon. My grandfather was very proud to have learned from R&#8217; Zelik.</p>
<p>Today, students of his across the world, in every imaginable profession and walk of life, mourn the loss of their teacher and spiritual guide.</p>
<p>Case in point: Native New Yorkers who listen to Sports Radio are all familiar with &#8220;The Fan&#8221; <a href="http://www.wfan.com/" target="_blank">660 WFAN</a>. Anyone who has listened during the daytime has become familiar with &#8220;Davening Dov Kramer&#8221;, an orthodox Jew. Davening Dov has worked at WFAN for as long as I can remember. He has been a Kiddush Hashem showing the world a wonderful example of an Observant Jew.</p>
<p>Last night Dov <a href="http://twitter.com/RabbiDMK/status/3115957704" target="_blank">sent me a Tweet</a>, to check out a note he wrote on Facebook. Dov wrote a note on his <a href="http://facebook.com/RabbiDMK" target="_blank">Facebook Profile</a> mourning the loss of his Rebbe. I highly recommend reading it in its entirety Facebook account required (if you don&#8217;t have one, send me an email and I will email the note to you directly). I would like to quote one small section that I found most powerful.</p>
<blockquote><p>I had gotten into radio to be able to reach people through the medium I always loved, and had wanted to learn the business from the &#8220;pros&#8221; before going into &#8220;Jewish&#8221; radio. &#8230; I didn&#8217;t think leaving radio (at least temporarily) would hinder my original goal of positively influencing people via the radio, so wanted to quit my job, move back to Israel (again, I was single and in my late 20s) to learn full-time. I figured I could get free room and board if I did something like being a dorm counselor at a yeshiva for Americans, so would still have no expenses and be able to focus on my learning. Before doing what I thought was clearly the &#8220;frum&#8221; thing to do (stop working to learn full-time), I went to speak to Rav Zelik.</p>
<p>I told him my plan, but he said it wasn&#8217;t a good idea. He was afraid that making such a radical change was unhealthy, and there was a danger that after a while I would regret having done it. Instead, he told me that I should keep working at WFAN &#8230; and learn for semicha at night. I had been doing some volunteer work for a kiruv organization (JEP-LI), and they offered me a job that would allow me to work half a day and learn half a day. I asked Rav Zelig if that was an option worth considering, and he told me that if I thought I could get &#8220;sipuk hanefesh,&#8221; that I would be satisfied doing kiruv professionally, that I could do it, but otherwise, the less of a change in my life I make while studying for semicha, the better.</p>

<p>This is a glimpse into the insight of a great man. Many people would have just assumed that more studying was an automatically better option. R&#8217; Zelik knew his student and knew what was truly best for his situation.</p>
<p>This kind of indiviualized, custom tailored Judaism is something a bit lacking in our &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; society. We need more Rabbis who can lead like R&#8217; Zelik did.</p>
<p>It is in this light that we all mourn the loss of a true individual, a true Gadol, R&#8217; Zelik Epstein.</p>
