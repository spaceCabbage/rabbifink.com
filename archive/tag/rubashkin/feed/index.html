				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ashkin-739831.gif"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4643" title="ashkin-739831" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ashkin-739831.gif?resize=216%2C145" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Allow me to begin by saying that it is not unreasonable to want to help Rubashkin. Certainly, when one of our own is thrown into the justice system we hope and pray that their experience will be as pleasant as possible. Incurring a harsh 27 year sentence is an eye popping, hair raising turn of events. Rubashkin deserves our compassion, empathy and assistance.</span></p>
<p>The question is does he deserve it any more than any of our many brothers (and sisters) that are in jail for fraud? Or other crimes?</p>
<p>And why does the frum media characterize any news about Rubashkin losing in court as &#8220;shocking&#8221;?</p>
<p>Some may answer that his sentence is so severe for a crime that seems so small (although in legal terms it is not &#8211; see:Â <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/09/19/the-rubashkin-case-a-no-spin-unbiased-summary/">The Rubashkin Case: A no-spin, unbiased summary</a>) it is a case that deserves our collective attention. This is a shortsighted view. Rubashkin had the frum world and their absolute support long before his conviction and long before his sentencing.</p>
<p>In fact, I believe Rubashkin had the frum community before the raid in May 2008.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this all began with PETA.<span id="more-4640"></span></p>
<p>PETA has been a thorn in the side of orthodox Jews for a while now. Whether it is about eating meat, slaughterhouse practices, kaparos or any other issue that evokes their activism, PETA has been a perceived foe of the frum community. The most public of their grievances with orthodox Jews involved none other than Rubashkin himself.</p>
<p>As far back as 2004 and again in 2007,<a href="http://www.peta.org/features/agriprocessors.aspx" target="_blank"> PETA attempted to expose harsh animal treatment in Agri&#8217;s slaughterhouses</a>. Video evidence surfaced. Other activist / liberal groups alleged unfair labor treatment and child labor occurred at Agri. The non-orthodox Jewish world was aghast. The orthodox world was confused.</p>
<p>At this point, Agri&#8217;s adversaries were liberals. They were common and easy foes for traditionalist orthodox Jews. When choosing between tradition and PETA, there is no question that tradition wins. And thus, the community&#8217;s allegiances were aligned. Rubashkin was being railroaded by these anti-Jewish groups. Allegations of anti-Semitism added fuel to the fire and Rubashkin was perceived as a victim. Here was a man who was providing the country with kosher meat and he was being portrayed as a villian. The &#8220;true&#8221; villains were the usual suspects, the liberal, anti-Jewish groups who had a personal vendetta against Rubashkin.</p>
<p>All of this was before the raid in May 2008.</p>
<p>So is it any wonder that when Rubashkin&#8217;s troubles escalated and he was being charged with labor violations and fraud charges that the names of the villains were simply transferred from PETA to the Federal Government?</p>
<p>The frum community had already staked so much on behalf of Rubashkin is comparatively minor criticism from activists. To use a very overused term, the community &#8220;doubled down&#8221; on Rubashkin. He was a martyr before he was arrested. He remained a martyr afterward.</p>
<p>I believe, that if Rubashkin had been charged without having had to deal with PETA and the like before the raid, the community would be sympathetic but not outraged by the trial, conviction, sentence and denial on appeal. To the objective eye, nothing is &#8220;shocking&#8221; (as the frum media described it) about the court&#8217;s holding. But the collective eye of the frum community has been on the Rubashkin bandwagon for a long time. Some pesky legal reasoning won&#8217;t deter the accepted sequence of events.</p>
<p>So, to summarize: What makes Rubashkin&#8217;s situation different is simply that he had the community&#8217;s support before he was busted by the Feds. He was supported in his battles against progressive activists who are a natural enemy to the frum community (though I would say unnecessarily so). When he got busted, the reasoning was that he was a victim once again. But this time it was the Federal Government. And it wasn&#8217;t really a question of ethics or morality, it was a question of guilt or innocence of serious crimes.</p>
<p>Again, this is all my opinion. Take it or leave it. The question has been floating around for a while, this idea hit me during a conversation and I thought some of you might agree or at least find it interesting.</p>
<p>This (hopefully) concludes my commentary on the Rubashkin saga. Feel free to send people to these posts if you are looking for an opposing view than what you will find in the rest of the frum media.</p>

(And a challenge to all the frum sites and newspapers to publish this summary.)</em></p>
<p><em>For a couple years now, the &#8220;frum&#8221; news sites and papers have reported a whitewashed version of the Rubashkin case. This has caused foolish outrage, claims of anti-Semitism, calls for the lives of the judges who presided over the appeal, condemnation of the criminal justice system and a gross double standard / hypocritical view of justice. All the frum media has been able to learn from this episode is not to trust the government and that we are a few logical steps away from Nuremberg Laws being applied to America. I have not seen one mainstream news article or editorial on honesty in business. Not one. This is understandable, because in the eyes of the frum community, Rubashkin is the victim of a blood libel and a contemporary Dreyfuss. In my opinion, this is reprehensible. We lose credibility as a community when we are not honest. But more importantly we are missing the greater lesson in all of this. Don&#8217;t break the law.</em></p>
<p><em> All the while, the frum community is footing the bill. (For an excellent review of why this case is not Pidyon Shvuyim I recommend an article written by Dovid Lichtenstein in the Spring 2011 issue of Hakira.)</em></p>
<p><em>This post is an attempt to set the record straight. Everything in this post is public record. Everything in this post is based on facts. There is no opinion in this post.</em><span id="more-4635"></span></p>
<p><em>Rubashkin got a raw deal. He is a victim of a very punitive system. The system is imperfect. But those flaws do not kasher the reality of what happened. For more on my personal outrage over the extreme sentence levied against Rubashkin please read this: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/06/22/27-years-is-a-harsh-sentence-but-not-the-only-harsh-sentence/">27 Years Is A Harsh Sentence But Not The Only Harsh Sentence</a></em></p>
<p>What follows is free of compassion or vendetta. It is an attempt to portray pure fact. Please feel free to reference this post when discussing the case with others:</p>
<p>Rubashkin was convicted of 86 counts of bank, wire, mail fraud making false statements to a bank, money laundering and violations of an order from the Secretary of Agriculture. His sentence was 324 months (27 years) which was on the low side of the guidelines.</p>
<p>In 1999 Agri opened a line of credit with First Bank Business Capital. To secure the loan, Agri offered its inventory and accounts receivable as collateral. Meaning, the bank gave the loan assuming that Agri was making a certain amount of money. Showing a greater number in accounts receivable would increase the credit line and increase the risk for the bank. The loan was for about $30 million daily in 2008.</p>
<p>Agri inflated its accounts receivable in two ways. First, they fabricated invoices to increase the accounts receivable. These were not errors. They were deliberate. Some of the false invoices were to accounts that prepaid Agri, so no invoices were needed. Others were to accounts that sold no meat like a clothing store. Others reflected balances on accounts paid in full. Others just inflated the amounts owed. The court estimates that these false invoices fraudulently increased Agri&#8217;s credit line by $10 million.</p>
<p>The second way Agri inflated it&#8217;s account receivables was by depositing money that was supposed to be paid to the receivable account into a separate account. This gave the bank the impression that the receivable account was still owed more money than it was actually owed.</p>
<p>Also, Agri would pay down the loan with money that came into their account from the bank. Agri would take money from the operating account, deposit it into the Yeshiva which was funded by Rubashkin and a local kosher market. The school and market would write checks back to Agri and they were deposited into the bank account designated for accounts receivable. The bank would see these deposits and assume the money coming in was genuine income. This fraud gave Agri an additional $3 million in credit that was obtained fraudulently.</p>
<p>These acts were the basis for the money laundering charges.</p>
<p>Finally, the bank&#8217;s agreement with Agri required that Agri comply with the Packers and Stockyard Act of 1921. It did not comply with the Act so the loan was continued fraudulently.</p>
<p>The records of these acts of fraud date back to <strong>January 2008</strong>. Months before the raid on Agri for immigration charges.</p>
<p>The records of money laundering begin in <strong>November 2007</strong>. Again, far in advance of the raid on Agri for immigration charges.</p>
<p>In May 2008, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raided Agri and arrested almost 400 hundred employees for immigrations violations. Around that time Agri was notified that it was the also the target of a federal investigation for financial crimes.</p>
<p>In November 2008, Rubashkin was arrested and indicted on 163 counts. The aforementioned fraud related counts and 69 counts of harboring undocumented aliens for profit and variety of other escalations like conspiracy and aiding and abetting.</p>
<p>For efficiency, the court split the fraud related counts and the immigration counts. It decided to try the financial crimes first. Rubashkin objected. The court proceeded regardless.</p>
<p>One of the employees arrested in the raid asked that the judge (the Honorable Linda Reade) be recused from his immigration case because she was involved in the logistics of preparing the courts for the barrage of arraignments and cases following the raid. Literally, hundreds of defendants were tried in makeshift court rooms. The Chief Judge was needed to make the necessary arrangements. The court acknowledged involvement but as Chief Judge this involvement was minimal, necessary and not prejudicial.</p>
<p>Rubashkin&#8217;s trial team was aware of this issue and aware of the court&#8217;s deicision not to recuse itself from the other trial and did not pursue the matter further during trial. A deadline for recusal motions was also set. No motions were made by Rubashkin&#8217;s lawyers before the deadline.</p>
<p>The kind of conduct that the court deems grounds for recusal has been found in two situations cited by the court. In one case the U.S. Attorney who was investigating the case <em>became</em> the judge. He was required to recuse. In a second case, the judge actually met with prosecutors and <em>assisted</em> them with their case before the grand jury. Mere knowledge of the raid and logistical assitance in setting up the necessary arrangements for en masse criminal trial after the raid does not rise to the level requiring recusal.</p>
<p>During the trial for the financial crimes some evidence of the immigration violations that were considered relevant to the fraud was introduced. Some of the charges in the fraud case were predicated on Agri&#8217;s statement that it was not &#8220;in violation of any law, statute, regulationâ¦ which . . . would in any respect materially and adversely affect the collateral . . . or [Agri&#8217;s] property, business, operations, or condition.&#8221; Since, the Bank&#8217;s collateral would be severely affected if Agri was violating immigration laws, and Agri <em>was</em> violating immigration laws, these violations formed the basis for 5 courts of fraud.</p>
<p>It has been argued that since Rubashkin was not convicted of immigration violations, the court should not have considered the immigration violations in the fraud case. The court argues that this is irrelevant. Individuals working for Rubashkin were convicted of immigration violations and were under his supervision. Rubashkin is culpable for those convictions as well.</p>
<p>The 27 year sentence has also been challenged. The prosecution and Rubashkin disagree on the amount of loss caused by the fraud. According to prosecutors the amount is $27 million and according to the defense it is $12 million. (Side note: this means that Rubashkin acknowledges that he is guilty of at least a $12 million fraud).</p>
<p>Rubashkin&#8217;s number is assessed by calculated how much extra money the bank lent him based in his fraud. The prosecution&#8217;s number is arrived at by calculating that number plus the default that Agri owed on the loan. The test to determine which number is used is a &#8220;foreseeabiiity test&#8221;. The court held that is was foreseeable that borrowing $12 million fraudulently would result in a default. Since it is foreseeable, the court properly considered that number when assessing the fraud.</p>
<p>As the to sentence, 324 months was on the low end of the range. The sentence was mitigated by Rubashkin&#8217;s circumstances as a father, first time offender and philanthropist. Without those factors the sentence would have been greater.</p>
<p>Another factor was Rubashkin&#8217;s lack of remorse during the trial. The perception of the court reflected the outrage of the community. In the orthodox Jewish community, Rubashkin was elevated to hero status as if he had done no wrong. This was consistent with Rubashkin&#8217;s refusal to cooperate with the government in their investigation and other trials. It also stands in stark contrast to other white collar criminals and even other defendants arising out the raid of Agri in November 2008.</p>
<p>Letters on behalf of Rubashkin were written by U.S. Attorney Generals and others. Their letters focused on the unfairness of the guidelines. They did not say Rubashkin was not guilty. They did not say that Rubashkin did not get a fair trial. They did not say the case was an example of anti-Semitism. Their complaint was limited to the general harshness of the sentencing guidelines. They did not say the guidelines were misapplied. They limited their criticism to the guidelines using Rubashkin&#8217;s case as an example of why the guidelines must be changed.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 90% of Federal cases settle. This is because the Feds rarely indict unless they are sure they are going to win. Of the 10% of cases that do not settle, the Feds win about 90% of those. One in a hundred Federal cases is won by the defendant. Rubashkin&#8217;s lawyers knew the score. If he had settled and entered a guilty plea and cooperated his sentence would likely have been 5 years or less (this is pure speculation but based on conversations with defense attorneys and prosecutors).</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will be posting my theory as to why Rubashkin has the blind support of the community. Stay tuned.

<p>I say unfortunately mis-titled because the book was excellent but it really was not about Jewish Pirates and certainly was not limited at all to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The book was good because it tells the story of some of the most famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converso">Converso</a> Jews following the Spanish and Porteguese Inquisition. The well footnoted text gave me a better appreciation for the 15 century Mediterranean Jews, their struggles and their success.</p>
<p>Perhaps above all, as I was reading the book I found myself with a greater appreciation for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardi_Jews">Sephardi Jews</a>.<span id="more-2598"></span></p>
<p>I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385513984?tag=eliyfink-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0385513984&amp;adid=08VJ6CN5645XHVXWS555&amp;">Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean</a> piecemeal. Every few weeks I would pick it up again and read another section. Meanwhile, in the real world, the Rubashkin saga has been dominated Jewish headlines. All the while, playing the victim card and charges of anti-Semitism in the legal system abound. The contrast of the Rubashkin campaigns and the reactions of the Conversos was striking.</p>
<p>Following decades of persecution and systematic genocide, the Jews of Spain and Portugal were forced northward. Many settled in Amsterdam. The local government tolerated the Jews but there were some blatantly anti-Jewish laws. The Jews were able to practice Judaism and in many respects they thrived there. For these refugee Jews, life was tough. It was not easy being Jewish.</p>
<p>The book follows the story of some of the Amsterdam Jews.</p>
<p>Not once, did I see a reference to &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221;. The Meditteranean Jews did not deal with their persecution by labeling it as anti-Semitism. I did not see any attempt to portray themselves as victims or the &#8220;lamb among the lions&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ashkenazic Jews were also persecuted heavily. They were ousted from many countries and killed in many genocides. To cope with the hate and bloodshed, anti-Semitism was &#8220;blamed&#8221;.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. My impression of the current Sephardic Jewry landscape is very similar. I don&#8217;t recall hearing accusations of anti-Semitism when it comes to Sephardic Jews. Just last summer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Dwek">Solomon Dwek </a> was arrested on Federal charges of bank fraud. This criminal pled guilty and awaits sentencing. I did not hear a peep about any anti-Semitism in his investigation.</p>
<p>Dwek is Sephardic.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the bank fraud that Rubashkin has been charged with. I have spoke to otherwise reasonable people who are convinced the whole thing is a plot by the anti-Semitic government. They say things like &#8220;this is how it was in Germany 1935&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rubashkin is not Sephardic.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that they heritage play a role in our collective reactions.</p>
<p>On one level, it seems that Sephardic Jewry never had a culture of blaming anti-Semitism while Ashkenazik Jewry has been crying about anti-Semitism for six centuries and using the term for around 150 years. Thus, we still react differently today.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, there also exists an anto-Sephardic bias in the Ashkenazik community (see:Â <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/06/24/somewhat-on-the-lighter-side/">Somewhat  On The Lighter Side</a>). Perhaps the Ashkenazic community does not consider anti-Jewish activity that harms Sephardic Jews &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Perhaps not. It&#8217;s just a thought.</p>

<p>This is what the shoe feels like when it&#8217;s on the other foot.</p>
<p>For decades, right-wing / republican / conservative / Judeo-Christian Valuists have talked a big game when it comes to fighting crime. Running on &#8220;Law and Order&#8221; platforms and promising harsh sentences for criminals was a sure way to gain support.</p>
<p>On the other hand, bleeding heart liberals have been trying to model the justice system after the softer Euro sentencing structures.</p>
<p>Traditionally, middle class white people support Law and Order style justice. Harsh sentences make them feel safer and they are less likely to know someone who will be incarcerated, thus they are removed from the effects of the harsh sentencing of criminals.</p>
<p>Lower class folks usually support softer punishments.<span id="more-2572"></span> They are the ones who are more likely to have friends and relatives in the justice system. For many of them, the softer the punishment, the sooner they get their daddy back.</p>
<p>It was real easy for us middle class white (Jewish) people to support strict sentencing guidelines when it didn&#8217;t really affect us. But after witnessing one of our own fall prey to the system we helped create I am sure we all feel differently. (Of course I am aware that there are some middle class white Jews who vote democrat and support liberal causes, I am talking to everyone else.)</p>
<p>27 years is a long time. Rubashkin is a crook but his sentence is very harsh. We now feel what lower class communities have felt for so long. Some of us now think the system is out to get us. They have felt that way all along. Some of us now are horrified by the sentencing guidelines and the leeway given to particularly strict judges. They have been saying this is a problem all along.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time for our community to more fully support softer punishments for all criminals. In some states (like mine &#8211; California) we are spending millions and millions of dollars locking up &#8220;3 Strikes&#8221; criminals for LIFE (including non-violent, minor felonies). That is even harsher than Rubashkin&#8217;s sentence. If we are outraged over his sentence let that outrage spill over into more socially conscious, activist role and help modify our current justice system.</p>
<p>But please, for intellectual honesty&#8217;s sake, be consistent. If you think Rubashkin got a raw deal, do some research and learn about how other people who made mistakes in their teens will spend their entire lives in jail because of America&#8217;s love of retribution. Help everyone who got shafted by the system and let&#8217;s try and prevent this from happening again, to anyone.</p>

<p>If you are like me, you have been reading about the Rubashkin saga for months. What began with a Federal raid at a meat processing plant to ferret out hundreds of illegal alien employees is now culminating with a federal and state trial.<a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/anti-semitic-poster1.jpg"> (</a><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26626858" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing that the raid was &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; and fueled by anti-semitism.</p>
<div>
<p>If you are like me you have been hearing that he was denied bail because of an anti-semitic fear that Rubashkin was a flight risk and would flee to Israel.</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing that his federal sentencing recommendation was anti-semitic. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/us/29postville.html" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing how the county jail was anti-semitic in not providing food that was kosher &#8220;to Rubashkin&#8217;s standards&#8221; and not permitting him to wear religious garb (tzitzis / tzitzit). (<a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20100509/NEWS/5090342/Rubashkin-dispute-highlights-faith-issue" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>I have three things I want to say.<span id="more-2466"></span></p>
<p>1) I feel terribly for Rubashkin. I feel terribly for any criminal who is sentenced to prison but more-so when the criminal is a family member of mine. As a fellow Jew, Rubashkin is family and it pains me to see him in this state. I support asking for leniency is a mentshlach way.</p>
<p>2) Rubashkin is the cause of much of the animosity towards him from the prosecution and judiciary. It is NOT, I repeat, NOT because he is Jewish, nor is it anti-semitic.</p>
<p>3) Even those who cry anti-semitism in this case are grossly misusing the term.</p>
<p>I think #1 is a well represented opinion throughout the Jewish community. It does not require any more attention from me. Consider me to have said &#8220;ditto&#8221;.</p>
<p>Number 2 is something that has been so wildly misunderstood it almost seems blatant. The reason Rubashkin&#8217;s plant was raided was NOT due to a plan hatched in the bowels of a Ku Klux Klan facility. The reason his plant was raided was because he snubbed the Unions by hiring illegals and the Unions were none-too-happy. They made the infractions known to the Feds and they raided the plant. Were there too many helicopters and fancy weapons? Probably. Was it anti-semitic? Probably not. The people who make these kinds of choices don&#8217;t, actually, CAN&#8217;T have vendettas against minorities. This is the Federal Government of the most benevolent host the Jewish people have ever had. Use your noodle people! There is no conspiracy! Who was president at the time? Our best friend George W. Bush. The federal agents were in his employ. Dare we think that the &#8220;anti-semitic raid&#8221; was orchestrated by our dear friend? Of course not.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Rubashkin was considered a flight-risk because agents found $10,000 cash in a packed bag with passports. Under normal circumstances that is a flight-risk. A packed bag with cash and passports could be reasonably interpreted as a &#8220;just-in-case&#8221; bag. Maybe it was a &#8220;just-in-case Moshiach comes bag&#8221;. I am willing to believe that was the case. But what would you think if you saw that bag and he wasn&#8217;t a frum Jew? Is it anti-semitism to draw the logical conclusion from finding that bag and denying him bail? Certainly not.</p>
<p>The sentencing recommendation was well within Federal guidelines. I was talking about the case to a lawyer friend of mine who works for the Court of Appeals and who knew nothing about the case. I told him some of the facts about the bank fraud. His immediate reaction was, &#8220;that&#8217;s a life sentence&#8221;. He didn&#8217;t know the crook was a Jew. He didn&#8217;t know the crook was accused of other crimes. He only knew about the bank fraud and he said &#8220;that&#8217;s a life sentence&#8221;. Is he anti-semitic? Who cares?! He didn&#8217;t know the cases involved a Jew when he said a life sentence was what the crook deserved!</p>
<p>Also, much has been made of &#8220;comparable criminals&#8221;. It is an unfair comparison because Rubashkin has not been cooperative. He was not willing to accept any plea deals. He maintains his complete, 100% innocence and is a difficult person for the court to deal with. He has many special requests and claims he is being victimized. He has offered only one half-baked apology since this saga began and has not taken any responsibility.</p>
<p>While in jail, Rubashkin has made special requests. Some have been honored and some have not. Some of the requests that have been honored and he has stated that he not satisfied with the kashrus of the food. It is kosher, just not kosher enough. Is it anti-semitic if they give him kosher food that most orthodox Jews would eat?</p>
<p>Also, Rubashkin will not walk without wearing Tzitzis. He states that his religion will not allow him to walk. So he has been carried around so that he will not violate this religious law. The problem is that he is with ignorant of the law or is just trying to be annoying. The law is that when one wears a four-cornered garment (think of a poncho or rectangular wrap) the garment must have a certain formula of strings attached to the garment at the corners. One is not required to wear such a garment. However it has become customary to wear one of these garments with the strings attached for prayer as well as during the day. But if you are not wearing a four-cornered garment the law does not require that you wear the strings (like a button-down shirt or blazer don&#8217;t need the strings). So why is Rubashkin making a stink out of an issue that is not religious? Is it anti-semitic if the jail does not cooperate with this?</p>
<p>I think it is clear enough that for every &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; act against Rubashkin, there is a plausible non-anti-semitic explanation as well. Let&#8217;s just stop with the anti-semitism cries.</p>
<p>As for #3, I dare you to look a Holocaust survivor in the eye and call this anti-semitism. Try telling it to a Jew who was thrown out of Spain and Portugal for not bowing to the Cross. Or how about Jews who were slaughtered during pogroms? Being prosecuted for actual crimes is not anti-semitism. Anti-semitism is hatred and cruelty to Jews for no reason other than the fact that they are Jewish. That is not the case here.</p>
<p>I have more to say about anti-semitism in general. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
