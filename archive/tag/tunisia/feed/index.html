<p>Everyone remembers the Malcolm Gladwell column about social media. It was the one where he said &#8220;the revolution will not be tweeted&#8221;. The basic premise is that revolutions need &#8220;strong ties&#8221; and the Internet does not create strong ties.</p>
<p>Everyone is also supposed to remember what I said about it at the time  <img src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> : <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/11/malcolm-gladwell-doesnt-use-twitter-or-facebook-but-he-is-pretty-sure-they-are-useless/">Malcolm Gladwell Doesnâ€™t Use Twitter or Facebook But He Is Pretty Sure They Are Useless</a>.</p>
<p>Yet another luddite has weighed in on the issue as well. Frank Rich said this:<span id="more-3783"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The talking-head invocations of Twitter and Facebook instead take the form of implicit, simplistic Western chauvinism. How fabulous that two great American digital innovations can rescue the downtrodden, unwashed masses. That is indeed impressive if no one points out that, even in the case of the young and relatively wired populace of Egypt, only some 20 percent of those masses have Internet access.</em></p>
<p>The recent protests and revolutions in the middle east should serve as a good case study for whether Gladwell / Rich is right or wrong. I have supposed that the protests were organized and galvanized via the Internet and in particular Facebook and Twitter. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/02/01/the-future-is-now-or-coming-soon/">The Future is Now (or coming soon)</a>).</p>
<p>It turns out there is some data on all of this. Andrew Sullivan at the Atlantic has a some anecdotal evidence. (Theses quotes were compiled by Sullivan.) Here is what Facebook says about the revolution in Tunisia:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8230;several hundred thousand more users than it had ever had before in Tunisia, a country with a few more people than Michigan. Scaled up to the size to the U.S., the burst of activity was like adding 10 million users in a week. And the average time spent on the site more than doubled what it had been before.</em></p>
<p>Twitter helped also. From the NY Times Lede blog:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Less than two weeks ago, Slim Amamou, a Tunisian blogger and activist, was using his @slim404 Twitter feed to let friends know that the police had been to his house. Later the same day, after he was arrested, the 33-year-old computer programmer managed to turn his phone on and log on to Google Latitude to broadcast his location: inside the countryâ€™s feared ministry of the interior.</em></p>
<p>And on the role of the Internet and social media in general we have this from Slim Amamou, a Tunisian activist who is now part of their government:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In 2008, there were uprisings in Redeyef, similar to what happened in Sidibouzid. But back then it seems that the internet community did not reach a critical mass. And then at that time, Facebook got censored for a week or two. I don&#8217;t remember if it was related. But it was like a training for this revolution. People think that this revolution happened out of nowhere but we, on the Internet have been trying for years, together and all over the Arab world. The last campaign that mobilised people was for Khaled Said in Egypt, and we Tunisians participated. And you have to remember that Egyptians (and people all over the world) participated in the Tunisian revolution: they informed, they participated in </em><em>Anonymous </em><em>attacks and they even were the first to demonstrate for Sidibouzid in Cairo.</em></p>
<p>There is not much to add here. Sullivan did a good job making his point. It&#8217;s a point that I absolutely agree with.</p>
<p>Like anything, there is much good to social media. There is bad as well. It is a tool that can be wielded by the brave, courageous and honorable. It can also be used to hurt people, spread lies and inflict pain. There is no reason to fear social media. As usual we only need fear the idiots that use it to act like idiots.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-future.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3716" title="the-future" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/the-future.jpg?resize=300%2C239" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>If you&#8217;ve known me for a little while you know I am an optimist. If we&#8217;ve talked about the conflict in the Middle East you know I am optimistic about that too.</p>
<p>For a little while now (at least a couple of years) I have maintained that the conflict will in effect, resolve itself, eventually.</p>
<p>Until recently, Gazans and West Bank Palestinians have heard one voice. A voice that told them in categorical terms that their life would be better under autonomous rule by Hamas or the PLO. Palestinians believed them. It created fanatics, fascists and suicide bombers. But people can only be told a lie so long as there is no evidence to the contrary.<span id="more-3710"></span></p>
<p>If someone tells you that the world is flat you know he is lying because you have information that shows him to be lying. Information is king. Therefore, I have contended that my generation (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y" target="_blank">Generation Y</a>) is the information generation. My generation does not accept lies or legends at face value. We know there is a way to learn on our own to unmask lies passed off as facts or legends passed off as history. We are the Wikipedia generation. We know that the information is available and we are willing to find it ourselves.</p>
<p>So long as information can be controlled, the public will kneel to authority, corrupt or otherwise. But once information is freely available to the masses, the lies unravel, the legends are exposed and truth can prevail. Authority that told those lies and legends is discarded and the people want truth, a voice and democracy. I have been saying that my generation of Palestinians and Muslims in general who have access to information will undoubtedly prefer to join the West in its freedoms, capitalism and democracy.</p>
<p>When the choices are death or unilateral agreement with authority, the choice is easy. When the choice is money, entertainment, enlightenment or unilateral agreement with authority, the choice is even easier. With the wave of unbridled information entering the oppressed masses in Arab countries, fundamental fanaticism will be replaced with a thirst for information and the allure of modern civilization. A lifestyle of books and e-books,Â Facebook and Twitter, Playstation and XBOX, e-commerce and ebay sure as heck beats a Third World existence. This is why my generation will resolve the conflict. Conflict serves no one but the elite and corrupt leaders. It will mean out with oppressive rulers and in with freedom.</p>
<p>The beginnings of this movement has already been formed in Gaza. A few weeks ago the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/02/free-gaza-youth-manifesto-palestinian" target="_blank">Guardian reported</a> on a &#8220;Manifesto&#8221; written by disgruntled Palestinians. They don&#8217;t want Hamas, they don&#8217;t want Fatah, they don&#8217;t want Israel, they want freedom.</p>
<p>What happened in Tunisia and what is happening right now in Egypt is more of the same. The people will not be controlled by corrupt Heads of State who demand allegiance for no reason other than &#8220;I said so&#8221;. The people want their freedom. They want what we have in the West. And they will get it. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/28/president-reagans-message-for-protesters-in-egypt/">President Reaganâ€™s Message for the Protesters in Egypt</a>)</p>
<p>A little bit of patience and gentle prodding from the West will help the next generation of Arabs achieve their emancipation. I maintain that 9/11 was a final salvo. The fundamentalist establishment tried one last time to supress the free flow of information by trying to destroy it. They failed and freedom is around the corner.</p>
<p>Just ask the protestors in Tunisia and Egypt.</p>
<p>I do admit that the protests are not without flaws. It is entirely possible that the new leaders will be equally despotic as their predecessors. We can only hope that will not be the case. But even if it is, it won&#8217;t last long. Change is coming. The cat is out of the bag and freedom is like a drug that is addictive and readily available. The public won&#8217;t be satisfied until they can drink the elixir of freedom. And they will.</p>
<p>This phenomena has also affected the orthodox Jewish community. The more information that becomes available, the more the religious leaders are concerned about losing their authority. This is silly. The authority of rabbis was never binding except in a rabbinic court or perhaps via an uncontested responsa. It is a folly of this generation&#8217;s leadership (or its handlers) that asserted this unilateral power. It never existed and yes, with information this imagined power will disappear. This is why the Internet is so feared by these rabbis. That is why the Internet is banned in charedi circles. It is because of the information and free flow of ideas that the Internet provides which in turn minimizes their invented power. Orthodox Judaism does not depend on charismatic or authoritarian rabbis, it depends of individual commitment to Jewish law and theology. Information is a boon to that kind of religious practice. If we are confident in orthodox Judaism as a viable way of life, information must be a friend, not a foe. I know that I am confident, I can&#8217;t say the same for those who cower in fear from information.</p>
<p>The future is now, or coming soon enough. The Internet is giving people a thirst for freedom and independence. Totalitarianism cannot win against the almost infinite amount of information that is easily accessible from a <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">device smaller</a> than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoPf98i8A0g" target="_blank">George Costanza&#8217;s wallet</a>.</p>
<p>Say hello to the future.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ronald-reagan_116041t.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3699" title="ronald reagan" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ronald-reagan_116041t.jpg?resize=210%2C210" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Today has been another day of unrest and protest in Egypt. This comes shortly after similar unrest in Tunisia.</p>
<p>Today is also the 25th anniversary of the Challenger disaster. I was 4 years old. I vaguely remember it. Certainly, throughout grade school we learned about the Challenger and the heroes who died for their country and science.</p>
<p>On Twitter, someone linked a video of President Ronald Reagan addressing the country on the heels of the disaster. In my opinion, a president should be a great leader. Politics are secondary to leadership skills. Presidents are never real extremists anyway, they need to be somewhat in the middle to get elected. Reagan was a great leader. He gave people hope, he gave people comfort and that is what I look for in a leader. Reagan&#8217;s short address exemplified his leadership.<span id="more-3698"></span></p>
<p>He had a message for the schoolchildren who witnessed the disaster in their classrooms. It was very traumatic and left millions of children with unanswered questions.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle&#8217;s take-off. I know it&#8217;s hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It&#8217;s all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It&#8217;s all part of taking a chance and expanding man&#8217;s horizons. <strong>The future doesn&#8217;t belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave.</strong></em></p>
<p>I would say the same applies to the insurgents in Tunisia and Egypt. We are witnesses to history today. The future belongs to the brave. It takes courage to stand up to tyranny. The protesters possess that courage.</p>
<p>When I was a child, Europe was in similar upheaval. Communist countries who had oppressed their citizens were being overturned seemingly every month. Today, we are witnessing a similar phenomenon in Tunisia and Egypt. Hopefully, this will usher in a new era of equality and fairness and not simply a new oppressive government.</p>
<p>The United States began in the same way. The people of this country overturned a tyrannical monarch to gain their freedom.</p>
<p>We share a lot with the protesters and our 40th president had a message that applies equally to them as it does to us.</p>
