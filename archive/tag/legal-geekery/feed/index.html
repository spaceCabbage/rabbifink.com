				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1542" title="idea light bulb" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IdeaLightBulb02.GIF-248x300.gif" alt="idea light bulb" width="174" height="210" />While the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/10/15/and-were-back/" target="_blank">blog was down</a> a very interesting Op-Ed appeared in the New York Times.</p>
<p>A journalist had a discussion with a man who could explain how the financial industry collapsed last year in one sentence.</p>
<p>Intrigued, the journalist pressed the man to explain. The answer? Wall Street got too smart.</p>
<p>In the old days, the Wall Street guys were not the top of their class, they were the jocks and slackers.</p>
<p>But now, all the MIT brainiacs are going to Wall Street.</p>
<p>Huh? If they were so smart how did they mess the whole thing up?</p>
<p>They were too smart.<span id="more-1541"></span></p>
<p>Briefly, they were so smart they realized they could leverage their assets to make money and they could explain it in a way that made sense to investors.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/opinion/14trillin.html?em" target="_blank">Read the NY Times column for the more expanded explanation</a>.</p>
<p>The article also makes a statement about which industries smart people choose for their careers. For the last couple of decades the smart people have been choosing Wall Street. Working in finance is exciting, fun and can be lucrative. However, it is not productive.</p>
<p><a href="http://legalgeekery.com/2009/10/02/scalia-lawyers-do-nothing-productive-for-society/" target="_blank">Justice Scalia said the same thing about lawyers.</a> So many lawyers are very bright, and they do help people and they help society, but they are not producing anything. Scalia said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em>I mean there’d be a, you know, a defense or public defender from Podunk, you know, and this woman is really brilliant, you know. Why isn’t she out inventing the automobile or, you know, doing something productive for this society?</em></p>
<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><em>I mean lawyers, after all, don’t produce anything. They enable other people to produce and to go on with their lives efficiently and in an atmosphere of freedom. That’s important, but it doesn’t put food on the table and there have to be other people who are doing that. And I worry that we are devoting too many of our very best minds to this enterprise.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The point is that for too long, the greatest minds in our country have not pursued industry and instead work in fields that do not have long-term benefit to society.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I discussed the evils of such a system in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2008/12/28/yosef-and-the-light-of-economic-wisdom-and-kindness-drasha-miketz/" target="_blank">this post called Yosef and the Economic Light of Wisdom and Kindness</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I agree with the man the jornalist spoke with and I agree with Justice Scalia. We need to somehow get our smart people in industry. When was the last time a U.S. carmaker made a car that really caught your eye or impressed you more than an import? We import clothes, we import technology and we import food.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Instead we should be producing the best cars, the nicest clothes, the greatest technology and the most food. But we are handicapped because our smart people don&#8217;t go into those industries.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 15px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 15px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">We need to find a way to fix it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1134" title="Ethics" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/law7-300x239.gif" alt="Ethics" width="300" height="239" />Lawyers take the brunt of  a lot of <a href="http://www.lawlaughs.com/money/legalethics.html" target="_blank">jokes</a> and <a href="http://www.lawlaughs.com/honesty/howmuch.html" target="_blank">jabs</a> questioning their ethics.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Law Schools actually teach Ethical Lawyering and every student is required to pass that class prior to taking the bar.</p>
<p>Law blog <a href="http://legalgeekery.com/" target="_blank">Legal Geekery</a> (recommended reading for law students) has an article criticizing the way Law Schools attempt to teach ethics to future lawyers.</p>
<p><span id="more-1131"></span>In short, the argument goes (<a href="http://legalgeekery.com/2009/09/09/law-school-ethic/" target="_blank">read here</a>), by testing law students with proctors in the room, law students are not taught how to make ethical choices. Also, exams are taken on a software that locks the test taker&#8217;s computer while they take the exam. Instead, the schools should trust students the same way they will need to be trusted when they are in the work force with no proctor watching them. By watching every move the students make, Law Schools in effect, leave Law Students unprepared for the &#8220;real world&#8221;.</p>
<p>It got me thinking. Judaism is full of rules and regulations. The Torah is basically a really tough rule book. Does keeping the Torah&#8217;s laws help one become more ethical? Using the argument on Legal Geekery, the answer is no. Just because I act ethically because I fear retribution does not help me make ethical decisions when there is no fear of retribution.</p>
<p>But I disagree. I think practice makes <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">perfect</span> better. The Torah and its commandments are practice for the not-directly-related-Torah world when we do not have explicit rules and regulations to abide by. When we train our minds and bodies to act a certain way those thoughts and actions can become second nature. Second nature is pretty powerful. In fact, I recently mentioned in a Sermon that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elyah_Lopian" target="_blank">Rabbi Elyah Lopian</a> held that second nature is stronger that our inborn tendencies. Our inborn tendencies are more easily changed than our bad or good habits. That is why good habits are so important. Rabbi Lopian explains that the commandments are tools for developing those good habits.</p>
<p>I see some strong parallels to Law School.</p>
<p>Law School is about developing good habits for Law Practice. Developing good habits for reading and briefing cases and developing good habits for analyzing facts and policies are what Law School is all about. Ethical Lawyering is the same. Developing good habits in ethics is good &#8220;practice&#8221; for &#8220;practice&#8221;. Doing your own work, solving problems on your own and using only permissible resources are good practice for becoming an ethical lawyer. Making honesty a habit will serve you well in practice. When ethics become second nature we can take away the training wheels and let you ride on your own with no proctor.</p>
<p>The proctor is training you. If you practice, you will make honesty second nature.</p>
