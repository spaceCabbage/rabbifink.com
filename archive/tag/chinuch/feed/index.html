<h2>Parshas Mishpatim<br />
Learn With Your Children!</h2>
<p>The conclusion of <em>parshas </em>Mishpatim features a return to the description <em>matan </em>Torah. We are told how Moshe Rabbeinu alighted Har Sinai. Upon his return, Moshe told Bnai Yisrael <em>es kol divrei Hashem v’es kol hamishpatim</em> &#8211; all the words of Hashem and all of His laws. Klal Yisrael responded in unison and proclaimed, “<em>kol divrei Hashem na’aseh.</em>” Whatever Hashem says we will do. This is the second time since the saga of <em>matan</em> Torah began to unfold that Bnai Yisrael responds to the gift of the Torah with an emphatic <em>na’aseh</em> &#8211; we will do! Nevertheless, despite the sincere motivation of Am Yisrael, their declaration of <em>na’aseh</em> is simply not enough. Finally, <em>kabbolas HaTorah</em> reaches its zenith a few Psukim later as, Klal Yisrael exclaims <em>na’aseh v’nishma! </em>Crowned with this most famous, wondrous refrain of &#8211; <em>we will do and we will hear</em>, <em>matan</em> Torah is complete. We are gifted the <em>Torah Hak’dosha</em> for eternity.</p>
<p>What caused the change in our response? Why did we jump from <em>na’aseh</em> to <em>nishma</em>? What finally inspired us?<span id="more-5169"></span></p>
<p>The Midrash tells us that during <em>matan </em>Torah<em>, Hashem Yisborach</em> demanded a guarantor from Klal Yisrael that we would watch and protect the gift of Torah being granted to them. At first, Klal Yisrael suggested the Avos. However, Hashem said no. Klal Yisrael then suggested <em>shamayim va’aretz</em>. Again, Hakadosh Baruch Hu refused. Finally, B’nai Yisrael offered their children to secure their commitment to Torah. This Hashem accepted.</p>
<p>This Midrash appears to be derived from the verses leading up to the <em>na’aseh v’nishma</em> declaration. Following the second affirmation of na’aseh we are told <em>vayishalch es na’arei Yisrael</em> &#8211; that the youngsters of Bnai Yisrael were sent out to bring a sacrifice. Afterwards, Moshe sprinkled the blood on the <em>mizbeyach</em> and read the Torah to the people. Only now they proclaimed <em>na’aseh v’nishma. </em>Why? Initially Klal Yisrael felt <em>Matan Torah</em> was for adults only. For themselves they were ready to proclaim and commit to <em>na’aseh</em>, personal <em>mitzvah</em> observance. However, they soon recognized that it was the youth who successfully brought the <em>korban </em>needed to complete the <em>matan </em>Torah experience. Bnai Yisrael then offered their children as the guarantor of <em>Kabolas HaTorah. </em>As they did so, they came to the realization that <em>matan</em> Torah was not just for them but it was for their<em> kinderlach</em> and generations to come.</p>
<p>Now a process for <em>mesorah </em>would need to be established to assure the effective transmission of our holy Torah from generation to generation. Thus <em>na’aseh </em><em>v’nishma</em> was the call. Effective transmission of our <em>mesorah</em> calls for a commitment to doing and more importantly to hearing and learning! This awareness is critical for us to protect and assure the <em>mesorah</em> we guaranteed to our antecedents and that our children insure for us. Indeed, being <em>mikabelei </em>Torah and strengthening our link in the chain requires that we reclaim that <em>na’aseh v’nishma</em> attitude. No, it is not enough to send our children to <em>yeshiva</em>. We must do and we must learn . .  . . . . with our  children!</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Toldos<br />
A Total Education</h2>
<p>The beginning of Parshas Toldos reintroduces us to the birth of Yitzchak Avinu as it begins to detail his legacy as a second of our avos. The Parsha begins <em>v’eileh toldos Yitzchok ben Avraham, Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em>. The commentaries wonder what the second half of this pasuk is teaching us since the verse already explained that Avraham was Yitzchok’s father. Rashi quotes the chazal which tells us that <em>Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em> is placed in the verse to teach us that Yitzchok looked exactly like his father and anyone who saw him knew that Avraham holid es Yitzchok, only Avraham can be his father (and not Avimelech, as the cynics of the generation had posited).</p>
<p>The Ibn Ezra takes a different approach. He explains the declaration that <em>Avraham holid es Yizchok</em> is referring to Yitzchok’s chinuch. Having fathered Yishmael, Avraham Avinu knew full well what it was like to have a child at risk. This time he took no chances. Not only did Avraham father Yitzchok but he also reared him to follow his teachings!<span id="more-4879"></span></p>
<p>In the nature versus nurture debate Avraham had discovered that both our needed. He thus faithfully transmitted all his values and priorities to Yitzchok his son. In every way Yitzchok was the physical and spiritual heir to Avraham Avinu. Similarly we are taught <em>kol milamid ben chaveiro kielu yaldo</em>. From the moment he was born, education, Yitzchok’s chinuch was Avraham Avinu’s full time preoccupation. He put all his <em>kochos leholid Yitzchok</em>, to guide, inspire and direct him on the path of greatness. And, with <em>siata dishmaya</em> he was blessed with success.</p>
<p>If we reflect back on nuances of the previous parsha leading up to and following Yitzchok’s birth we can mine some vital gems of chinuch priorities we can apply today. The Meforshim wonder what is the linkage between the destruction of Sedom and the <em>besurah tova</em> to Avraham and Sara that they will be blessed with a son? The three malachim traveled together, obviously there was a connection to their individual missions. Some explain first and foremost that Sedom had to be destroyed before Yitzchok could be born. There would be no way to rear a Yitzchok to the status of a <em>korban olah</em> with a Sedom in the environs. Thus when the malachim told Sara she would have a son they immediately set out to destroy that which could corrupt and derail all that Yitzchok could grow to be.</p>
<p>Avraham and Sarah understood this message and when the time came they exiled Yishmael from their home. A painful choice that with Hakadosh Baruch Hu’s blessing cleared the environment for Yitzchok to thrive. Even with his new beloved son growing up before his eyes, Avraham stuck to his own mission of outreach in kiruv. <em>Vayeeta eishal b’Vear Sheva</em>, and guest filled his home connecting to Hakadosh Baruch Hu (eishal was the acromyn for achila, shtiya velina). In this manner Yitzchok learned his <em>achrayus</em> to the klal and the need to spread the reality of Hashem Yisborach to a lost and pagan world.</p>
<p>Finally, after the <em>akaida</em> (22:19) Ibn Ezra wonders why the pasuk says vayashav Avraham el niarav, it seems that Avraham alone returned. Where was Yitzchok? The Ibn Ezra explains that following the <em>akaida</em>, the climactic moment of <em>gelui shchina</em> and <em>mesiras nefesh</em> when he was almost shechted, Yitzchok reached a tremendous <em>madraiga</em>. Avraham wanted to capitalize on the energy of the moment and therefore sent him to learn in the Yeshiva of Shem V’ever so that he could build on his inspiration and through <em>limud haTorah</em> to soar to even greater heights that would remain with him long after the inspiration had waned. <em>Avraham holid es Yitzchok</em>. He directed every aspect of his total development, <em>b’gashmius, b’ruchniyus, b’middos, b’mitzvos, b’yiras shamayim ub’limud haTorah</em>.</p>
<p>This message should never be lost upon us. Chinuch must be the full time preoccupation especially in our challenging environment where the elimination of the Sedom’s of our world are simply impossible. As such, we must be even more careful in providing balance between removing corrupting influences from our home (Yishmael) and providing healthy opportunities to see others not committed to our values but who we confidently bring under our sphere of influence without the fear that we will be corrupted by them. As careful as Avraham was with the chinuch of Yitzchok, he did not put his head in the sand nor completely isolate him from the world at large. Finally, we must show our children that Talmud Torah is <em>kineged kulam</em>. It is not enough to be inspired but we must live inspired. Therefore at the moments of great spiritual peeks we must look towards our learning to be the glue that enables us to hold onto that moment and maximize its impact each and every day.</p>
<p>Like Avraham we cannot have a <em>hesech hadaas</em> from the chinuch of our children. We can learn from him. Iy”H as our children grow it will be said of each of us that we were holid each of our offspring.</p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Yisro<br />
Royalty!</h2>
<p>The revelation at Sinai is the quintessential Chinuch experience. On Har Choreiv, Torah was taught to Klal Yisrael for the very first time. The instructor was none other than Hashem Yisborach Himself. There is much we can learn from Matan Torah in terms of the recipe needed for effective instruction. Examining the “Chinuch paradigm” inherent in the experience of Matan Torah we see that it is filled with structured, relevant, individualized content, powerful audio-visual aids, and unique special effects all of which motivated and inspired the active participation of all the talmidim. What a powerful model for teaching and transmitting our mesorah. However, we must look even more closely at the Sinaitic experience for an important ingredient that is sometimes overlooked in our understanding of Matan Torah. It is so relevant today.<span id="more-3665"></span></p>
<p>Before presenting the Aseres Hadibros, Hakadosh Baruch Hu tells Moshe Rabbeinu to stress to Klal Yisrael V’atem ti’hiyu li mamleches kohanim v’goy kadosh, “You, Klal Yisrael, are to be My chosen people and holy nation.” Interestingly, this is Klal Yisrael’s introduction to Matan Torah. As Hashem is about to give us His most precious treasure, the very gift which defines us as a people, it is not the sanctity of Torah, Yesodos of Emunah, nor Mitzvos or even Middos that He emphasizes but rather it is attitude.<br />
We are being shown that in order for the Torah to take root, we have to be aware of our potential. We can be a noble, chosen people. Indeed, we need to know who we are and what we can be! Seeing that it sets the tone for Kabbalas HaTorah, transmitting this awareness must become the highest priority in every educational setting. It is important in every classroom, be it the lessons taught at school or those modeled at home.</p>
<p>We all play a vital role in the development of this positive Torah attitude in our children, be it our own offspring or the tinokos shenishbu we encounter and hope to be mikareiv to our Father in heaven. The tone is set by our attitude toward the Chinuch activities that fill our lives daily (just about everything we do!) From “Parsha Time” at the Shabbos table to the alacrity and enthusiasm placed in Talmud Torah and mitzvah observance in our homes or in the public eye, we are the instructors and what we do matters.</p>
<p>Hakadosh Baruch Hu, kiviyachol, showed us a model at Sinai. When we help our children see themselves as a part of dynasty of kohanim we can hope to have the Siyata D’Shamya to rear them into a goy kadosh – a holy nation.</p>

<h2>Parshas Bereishis</h2>
<h2>The Chinuch Environment</h2>
<p>The tragic story of Kayin and Hevel is familiar to us all. The Torah recounts that Kayin went about rebuilding his life after murdering his brother. We are told that the first step in this self-renewal was his starting a family. Soon thereafter, Kayin had a son. He named him “Chanoch,” reaffirming his dedication to chinuch, educating his child. Then, we are told, Kayin took another step. He built a city, “vayikrah shem ha’ir k’shem b’no Chanoch — and he named the entire city for his son, Chanoch.” Why? What is the lesson we are to learn from this?<span id="more-2888"></span></p>
<p>Chazal teach us that we are all descendants of Kayin born of Noach’s wife, Naama, who was Kayin’s (grand)daughter. When Kayin was born, Chava proclaimed “kanisi ish es Hashem  — I have acquired a god.” Cute baby Kayin. His mother treated him as a little deity and assumed his perfection. She did not rear her son with limits and values. Indeed, her first born may have been somewhat spoiled. Lacking boundaries and priorities, he grew into a murderer. However, the adult Kayin, given the opportunity for teshuva, recognized that indeed, children need nurturing. Each child is a delicate flower which must be personally tended to. Yes, Kayin understood all too well, that a laissez faire attitude toward child rearing produced a horrific result. He therefore, focused his passion on chinuch habonim, educating his child with ethics and standards. But he knew (as do we) that to actualize a singular commitment to education requires more than a good home; it demanded that an entire community be developed that reinforced his ideals. Only then could he be sure that his son would be equipped with the morals necessary to make the right choices in his future. So Kayin built a city and created the environment for his offspring to thrive.</p>
<p>This message is insightful in rearing our children. We need to set standards and priorities for them as we nurture them at home and inculcate them with values in school and in the community. Their circle of friends, their exposure to media and their leisure activities need to be in consonance with our long term goals for their spiritual growth and development. Our activities as well, must reflect the realities we wish for our children. A consistent message of ahavas Hashem, yiras Shamayim and devotion to personifying b’chol drachecha da’eihu in each of our own undertakings will ensure the life long vitality of our children’s growth into the bnei and bnos Torah that we daven for them to be.</p>

I was asked to speak before a crowd that had just enjoyed seeing the life of Corrie ten Boom performed.

One message of that story is that is good, moral decisions do not happen in a vacuum. Children learn from their parents.

But how are we to instill the lessons we want our children to learn?

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></strong></p>
<h1>An Eye on One’s Heart</h1>
<p>With the conclusion of the parsha Moshe finishes his soliloquy, beseeching Klal Yisrael to stay the course of Yiras Hashem and Shmiras Hamitzvos. After 40 years of leadership, the prose of Haazinu and indeed all of Sefer Devarim was to be his epitaph and our eternal inspiration.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that after Moshe Rabbeinu concluded his message he framed his final instructions by saying<span id="more-1325"></span>, “simu livavchem l’chol hadivarim asher anochi mei’id bachem hayom asher titzavum es bineichem lishmor la’asos es kol divrei Hatorah hazos” — And Moshe concluded his words and said, “now place them on your heart&#8230; that you should transmit them to your children.”</p>
<p>In defining the structure needed for effectively conveying our Mesorah to our children, Moshe did not merely say to heed his voice and follow his directions. Rather, he said to take the message to heart. Why?</p>
<p>Rashi explains that Moshe Rabbeinu was expressing a powerful message for Chinuch Habanim, educating our children. Tzarich adam sheyihiyu einav v’aznav v’libo michuvanim l’divrei Torah! Yes, to transmit our heritage one must have his eyes, ears and heart tuned in to the powerful lessons of Torah.</p>
<p>Lip service alone won’t do. A Torah lifestyle has to be seen as relevant in all aspects of our lives. Yiras Shamayim has to be heard as the natural sound of our daily Avodah. Indeed, our dveikus b’Hashem has to be so palpable that it can be felt, heart-to-heart in our home and on the job. Our children will then sense and absorb this multi-modal lesson and live it as well.</p>
<p>So how does one get there? Upon closer examination Rashi leaves us with an even more profound message. In commenting on the posuk and the need to “simu livavhchem” to engage your heart in avodas Hashem, Rashi presents a vital sequence. First he tells us sheyhyu einav—that your eyes must be focused on your relationship with Hashem and His Torah. Without training our outlook, refining our vision and conditioning our perspective to a Torah point of a view we will never get our heart into to it.</p>
<p>Our avoda starts with our eyes. With seeing ourselves and the Ribbono Shel Olam as relevant, personal meaningful and loving. We can then “hear” what he wants from us and we can feel with a full heart our deep closeness to Him and His closeness to us. After all, if we only knew how much Hashem Yisborach loved us, we would never do anything wrong.</p>
<p>Moshe Rabbeinu’s paradigm for Chinuch is as relevant today as it was the first time he spoke these words. When it comes to our yiddishkeit It is not enough to know. We must have heart. To get there we must develop our outlook. Indeed, it is vital for children to see and hear the living words of Torah in our lives.</p>
<p>In so doing we will be zoche to a g’mar chasimah tova, lanu ul’chol Yisrael.</p>
