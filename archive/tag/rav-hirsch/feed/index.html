				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The term Rationalist Judaism has been clanking around the Internet and Orthodox Jewish conversation for a while now. It’s not quite a movement, but there are some very strong contemporary voices behind Rationalist Judaism. Many people think the term is an oxymoron. Others think it is intellectually dishonest. Yet others think it is heresy. But without a working definition or at least a framework to understand what we are talking about, any conversation about Rationalist Judaism will result in people talking past one another and miscommunication.<span id="more-7938"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7939" alt="Thinking-Man-Rodin" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Thinking-Man-Rodin.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>First, to address the complaint that calling one brand of Judaism “Rationalist” is insulting or offensive to everyone else. It sure seems like the term is implying that everyone else is irrational. This is not the correct implication. Rationalist Judaism is not to the exclusion of irrationality. Instead it is to exclusion of supernaturalism. That’s not to say that mysticism is inherently irrational either. Maybe it is for some. These are just the words that are used to describe two different approaches to God and Judaism. Words are often cumbersome and imprecise. That is the case here. We don’t mean to say Rationalist Judaism is rational and everyone else is irrational.</p>
<p>In general, rationalism literally means to use reason above all else. In this view, truth can be deduced and is not subject to fallacies like appeals to authority or <em>argumentum ad populum</em>. Obviously, a religious person maintains some belief in authority and relies on some subjective baseline truths that cannot be logically argued. But we are not talking about pure rationalism. We are talking about Rationalist Judaism.</p>
<p>I believe that term Rationalist Judaism was adapted from the term Theistic Rationalism. Both groups share some common principles. The basic idea of both groups is to release theology from supernaturalism and focus on morality. To the extent that supernaturalism can be justifiably removed from religion, Rationalist Judaism holds it should be removed. That is all Rationalist Judaism really means.</p>
<p>There are several heroes and champions of this concept, none greater than Rambam. In his halachic and philosophical works, Rambam sought to eliminate superstition, mysticism, and supernaturalism from Judaism to the greatest extent possible. One overriding theme of his works is that there is nothing supernatural other than God. Giving power to charms, incantations, or even angels is akin to idol worship. He held that belief in God was logical. He held that prophecy was a natural result of perfection. He held that God rarely intervenes with nature. He held that <em>Mitzvos</em> have material benefits for the person who performs the Mitzvah. He held that astrology was bunk. He held that God conformed the Torah to the needs of mankind. He held that <em>Maaseh Breishis</em> was science. He held that <em>Maaseh </em><em>Merkava</em>h was metaphysics. There is not a single mystical idea mentioned in any of his books. It’s as if there is no such thing as mysticism in Rambam’s universe.</p>
<p>Some have tried to argue that Rambam was a mystic and obscured his true views. This has been thoroughly debunked by many great scholars and if you are of this mind, I direct you to this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764158/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1906764158" target="_blank">Maimonides’ Confrontation with Mysticism</a></p>
<p>There are many other examples of great Torah authorities who used similar principles in their halachic, or philosophical, or exegetical works. R’ Samson Raphael Hirsch wrote Horeb, a book of the philosophy of <em>mitzvos</em> without a single kabbalistic reference. The entire book makes sense of Torah Judaism and it all works even if one rejects mysticism.</p>
<p>Ralbag is another. His commentary on Chumash literally reinterprets examples of supernatural events into metaphors or visions instead of real life occurrences. His worldview fit this same broad category. To the extent that supernaturalism could be excised from Torah and Judaism, he saw to it that they were.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Rationalist Judaism. It’s a tradition that has a long and powerful chain of great Torah luminaries who lived by this philosophy.</p>
<p>Another important element of Rationalist Judaism is that because God’s intervention and communication with man is so limited, the Mesorah and Holy texts of Judaism are more subject to error than one who believes that God ensures the truth of everything. In the opposing view, God’s essence permeates the writings of men like the great Talmudic scholars known as Chazal. Thus, their writings are presumed to be free of mistakes or misjudgments. Rationalist Judaism holds that the best efforts of man can still result in error. This is especially true in matters that are not Torah specific. We refer here to math, science, history, medicine, and other disciplines not directly related to Torah. However, even if Chazal were to err in issues of halacha or Torah specific interpretation, it would not matter as they have the authority to establish the laws for the Jewish people.</p>
<p>It’s true that this sort of thinking led many people to conclusions that we would reject today. Rambam himself was of the belief that God’s existence is provable. Rambam also thought Aristotelian philosophy and science were as true as God’s word in the Torah. We know that both of these are actually untrue. Does this mean that Rationalist Judaism is wrong? Of course not.</p>
<p>In fact, only someone whose paradigm is that Torah authorities are infallible would argue that by disproving Aristotle the entire worldview of Rambam is incorrect. But the paradigm of Rationalist Judaism does not allow for this sort of thinking. People do err, only God is infallible. So Rambam dealt with truth in the same way Chazal dealt with truth. That is, they were subject to the thinking and common beliefs of their time. We are also subject to the thinking and common beliefs of our time. Therefore, we are also supposed to look at Torah through the prism of modern thinking. No one actually pretends that Rambam was a Modern Orthodox Jew of 2013 America. But his worldview is one that allows, or even requires, using contemporary thinking to build one’s Jewish life. That’s what Chazal did and that is what Rambam did and that is what we are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Rambam is not making the claim that Chazal and the prophets before them lived and believed the same way he believed. Rather he is making the argument that with the same information available to Rambam they would have drawn the same conclusions as Rambam. Further, he demonstrates that so much of what they did say is compatible with his Aristotelian, Islamic influenced philosophy. However, even if they would have not reached the same conclusions, they would have used all the available information and evidence to formulate their views. That is what Rationalist Judaism attempts to do as it has always attempted to do.</p>
<p>But what’s the point of all this? Isn’t it obvious that there are supernatural forces and that Judaism believes in mysticism?</p>
<p>The answer to this very serious question is that Rambam held that these were all corruptions. In his view, true Judaism does not have any of the trappings of a supernaturalist cult. God is supernatural, a few miracles that were necessary for the birth of our nation occurred in Biblical times, but other than that, Judaism is a religion that is supposed to be hyper-focused on the practical matters of personal growth and emulating God in our lives.</p>
<p>Sure, many great people introduced mystical or supernatural elements into Judaism. Most people believe in them too. But in Rambam’s view, these are human additions and emendations. They are not integral to serving God, and may in fact harm our service of God.</p>
<p>For someone who believes in the supernatural and mystical this all sounds crazy. That’s fine. However, not everyone is predisposed to believing in things that they can’t see or prove. Those people may still be willing to suspend their disbelief or skepticism and believe in God or even in Divine Revelation. However, if they are not required to believe in mysticism and its trappings of Zoharic and Lurianic kabbalism, the ties to astrology, the use of charms and <em>segulos</em>, the existence of demons, the belief that human beings can be infallible, the idea that Chazal had access to modern science (but didn’t tell everyone about penicillin), that God still communicates with humans (but only to Orthodox Jews), and many other beliefs that require active supernaturalism and a healthy dose of non-skepticism, then why should they believe in those things? Further, if they were required to believe in these things, would it surprise us if they rejected the entire package? No, it would not. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/16/judaism-of-the-future-my-response-to-klal-perspectives-spring-2012/" target="_blank">Judaism of the Future: My Response to Klal Perspectives Spring 2012</a>)</p>
<p>Rationalist Judaism is a real thing. It’s not a fantasy. It’s not a boogeyman that seeks to demonize those who believe in supernatural Judaism. It’s an alternative for people who are more skeptical. It’s a way of serving God without being forced to believe in an entire universe that stretches beyond what is acceptable in their view. There are other side benefits to this perspective. Some of them have already been discussed on this and other blogs. One of those benefits will be the subject of a future post.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that one can practice Orthodox Judaism and love God and make a Kiddush Hashem without mysticism. It still works. Perhaps it even works better. But no matter how one practices their Judaism, it is wise to establish both views as viable options. In this way, we can ensure that the personality types that are drawn to mysticism and skepticism have a place in Orthodox Judaism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/800px-Elal_b777-200_4x-ecd_arp.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5381" title="800px-Elal_b777-200_4x-ecd_arp" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/800px-Elal_b777-200_4x-ecd_arp.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I am blessed to be able to spend Pesach in Israel this year. En route, we made a stopover in Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
<p>I know many people who are uncomfortable with anything remotely German. They do not buy products from Germany, they would never visit for recreation, and they have a general distaste for the German language. I understand these people. I am not one of them.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to let go of the feelings that associate the Holocaust to Nazis and Nazis to Germans. For some, it is disrespectful to those who perished in the Holocaust to treat Germans like everybody else. I am not judging these people. At all.</p>
<p>As I said, I am not one of these people. It could be that I had no family who fell victim to the Nazis so it is less personal for me. I like to think that I should bear no resentment towards grandchildren and great-grandchildren of murderers. After all, they committed no crime. The physical land caused us no harm and the people who caused the harm are long gone. It seems that hatred towards present day Germany is irrational at best.</p>
<p>But again, I can understand this irrational belief.</p>
<p>In fact, when I think of Frankfurt or Germany my mind immediately turns toward R&#8217; Hirsch and then to the incredible legacy of German Torah and Judaism stretching back to the first exile 2500 years ago.</p>
<p>Just because I have positive feelings towards modern Germany does not mean that the recent significance of the place is lost on me. I felt a particularly strong stirring inside me as our El Al jet raced down the runway and took off towards Israel. The surge of emotion that I felt brought tears to my eyes. It relates to Pesach and I think provides us a nice message as we begin this year&#8217;s Pesach celebration.<span id="more-5380"></span></p>
<p>What would our brothers and sisters have done 70 years ago to hop on a plane in Franfurt and fly to Israel. First of all, they were not free to leave. They were in concentration camps, death camps, in death marches, in hiding, or on the run. Our Jewish brothers and sisters could not just leave the country like I did today.</p>
<p>More importantly, they had no Land of Israel to go to! Today, any Jew who wants to go home has a home in Israel. Seventy years ago, there was no Jewish homeland. Today there is a Jewish homeland. Imagine the emotional lift the victims of the Holocaust may have felt had they known that if they survived, they would be able to settle in Israel.</p>
<p>So taking off in Germany and landing in Israel on an El Al plane is a powerful thing. We cannot overlook how lucky we are that we can choose to freely make that trip that so many before us have yearned for so strongly.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that we should also pause and reflect on these modern times where previously held and entrenched (false) ideas about people who are different from one another are slowly being purged from our global community. There is plenty of work to be done. But it is worth considering how far we have come as well.</p>
<p>As we head into Pesach and we are commanded to feel the freedom our forefathers felt as they left Egypt, it seems prudent to revisit the more recent euphoric redemption that rose from the ashes of the Holocaust. In these heady times of freedom and a Jewish homeland it can be difficult to conjure up the emotions of a nation in slavery in search for a homeland. For more than 1500 years, the seder was a rallying call to return to the land of Israel and to feel free once again. Today we are free and we can all go to Israel if we chose to do so.</p>
<p>We have so much for which we must be thankful. The Jewish world today is nothing like the Jewish world from which so many of our grandparents and great grandparents came. Sometimes, it takes an El Al flight from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv mere hours before Pesach to put it all in perspective.</p>
<p>Wishing everyone a chag kasher v&#8217;sameach.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In anticipation of the upcoming gift giving season I have compiled a short list of books that I think would make a great gift for the orthodox Jewish Rationalist in your life. If that happens to be you, ask for an Amazon gift card and buy these books for yourself!</p>
<p><em>Get an Amazon gift card here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00067L6TQ/ref=nosim/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank">Amazon Gift Cards</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em></p>
<p>I have read all these books. I wholeheartedly recommend them. I have not done full reviews of most of these books on the blog but I have included a brief description and the rationalist significance of each of these books. I hope that if you have other books to recommend you will leave your suggestions in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>The list:</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4888"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583303693/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1583303693">Masterplan: Judaism&#8211;Its Program, Meaning &amp; Goals</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Carmell, this book is based on R&#8217; Hirsch&#8217;s Horeb. It gives a framework for understanding the structure of Judaism and its commandments. It does so without using a single passage from the mystical sources. It is excellent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/190411329X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=190411329X">Maimonides&#8217; Confrontation with Mysticism</a> &#8211; Written by Menachem Kellner, this book (without saying so) debunks a common claim made by contemporary orthodox Jews. The claim is that the Rambam would have been a mysticist if only he had received the Kabbalistic Tradition. This book shows that the Rambam specifically set out to forge a rationalist path of Judaism.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00876HOFI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00876HOFI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Hashgachah Pratis: An Exploration of Divine Providence</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Aryeh Leibowitz, this book studies the various approaches to Hashgacha Pratis. There is a maximalist view that is prevalent in orthodox Judaism today. The rationalist is more likely to find meaning in the more minimalist views of the rishonim as they are documented in this book.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764239/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1906764239">The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides&#8217; Thirteen Principles Reappraised</a> &#8211; Written by Marc Shapiro, this book, in convincing fashion, describes the myriad of opinions on matters of faith. Most people assume the Rambam&#8217;s 13 Principles have universal acceptance among Jewish thinkers throughout the millennium. Shapiro demonstrates that things are not so simple. Every meaningful point in this book is made with a traditional, accepted orthodox Jewish source.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933143150/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1933143150">The Challenge of Creation: Judaism&#8217;s Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, this book is a rationalist explanation of Cosmology. This is a particularly difficult area of Torah to navigate without mysticism. Rabbi Slifkin does an excellent job in this book. All of Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s books are excellent. This is the most crucial book for rationalists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933143185/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1933143185">Sacred Monsters: Mysterious and Mythical Creatures of Scripture, Talmud and Midrash</a> &#8211; Also written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, this book explains the various creatures that seem too fantastical to be real. Either they were real and magical creatures exist or they were not real and magical creatures do not exist. This book takes the latter position and explains many of these passages that have troubled rationalists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dovbear-on-the-parsha-dov-bear/1113656036?ean=9781257153367">DovBear on the Parsha</a> &#8211; Written by DovBear, I did a review of this book here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/06/book-review-dovbear-on-the-parsha/">Book Review | DovBear on the Parsha</a>. This is a great book that opens the reader up to a world of pshat and medrash within our mesorah that does not embrace mystical interpretations. It also shows that with a little thinking and hard work, we can all contribute to Torah.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0791408027/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0791408027">In the Shadow of History</a> &#8211; Written by Chacham Jose Faur, this is book that opens one up to a Chacham Faur&#8217;s writings. I could have chosen many of his articles and books. But I believe that this is the most thought provoking of his books and articles that I have read. It is not quite an indispensable rationalist text but Chacham Faur is indispensable so I have suggested at least one of his books in this list.</p>
<p><strong>Double Bonus</strong>: Subscribe to <a href="http://www.hakirah.org/">Ḥakirah</a> and read Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s blog: <a href="%20http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/">Rationalist Judaism</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/6547moon_phases.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4690" title="6547moon_phases" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/6547moon_phases.jpg?resize=207%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Tablet Magazine tells us that there is a new crisis in the orthodox Jewish community. Keeping two days of yom tov outside the Land of Israel is under attack.</p>
<p>The Torah commands the Jewish people to celebrate certain holidays with restrictions on creative activity akin to Shabbos. There are 6 days like this in the Torah. Rosh Hashanah (1), Sukkos (2), Shmini Atzeres (3), Pesach (4,5) and Shavuos (6). In the Diaspora these days are celebrated for two days of restrictions on creative activity akin to Shabbos. When these days fall out on Thursday and Friday it creates the proverbial 3 day yom tov. For 3 straight days, one is bound by those restrictions and it can make even the most fervently religious and observant person uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It seems that the discomfort is becoming so great that liberties are being taken with the &#8220;2nd day&#8221;.</p>
<p>An article in Tablet describes one orthodox family that allows their family to use &#8220;electronic entertainment&#8221; on the 2nd day. They have basically abandoned the 2nd day but supposedly keep everything else. Over time they have found more families that observe similarly and they feel less guilty. In fact the mother was quoted as saying &#8220;Mostly, I feel like I know a fabulous secret that no one else knows.&#8221;</p>
<p>The article assumes that the backlash and difficulty in keeping the 2nd day comes from a lack of understanding or appreciation for why we keep the 2nd day. I tend to agree.</p>
<p>As a rabbi in a very diverse community I have been asked this very question in many way, shapes, forms and formats. Perhaps my understanding of the issue will help illuminate some of the people who are on the fence or even if they are not on the fence, curious, as they should be about the observance of 2 days in modern times.<span id="more-4689"></span></p>
<p>First, a bit of background and history.</p>
<p>The first commandment given to the Jewish people as a nation was the requirement that they follow the lunar calendar and establish the new months via witnesses who testify that the new month had begun. When 2 witnesses would see the new moon they would come to the court and testify as what they saw. If their testimony was accepted, the new month would begin immediately.</p>
<p>Sometime during the Second Temple a comprehensive lunar calendar became available. But the Biblical requirement to establish the new month via witnesses remained. Further, there was a bit of ambiguity that remained in the calendar. The previous month could be 29 or 30 days. This would be determined by the witnesses. If the moon was seen the eve of the 30th day it would become the 1st of the next month and the previous month would have had 29 days. If it was seen the eve of the 31st day the previous month will have had 30 days and the next day would the 1st.</p>
<p>The news of the new month was sent across the Land of Israel and the territories with Jewish inhabitants. News of the new month would hit almost immediately in Israel. But the outlying territories would not hear about the precise date of the new month for up to 2 weeks.</p>
<p>So in Israel it was simple to establish the start of the holidays that begin on the 15th of the month (Sukkos and Pesach) and on the 15th the holiday began, they celebrated one day as the Torah commands. But in the outlying territories, news of the which kind of month, the 29 day month or the 30 day month, was not heard before the holiday was scheduled to commence.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s assume the 29th was Sunday. If the 30th day was really the 1st day of the new month, the 15th would be Monday. If the first day of the new month was the day after the 30th, the new month would begin on Tuesday and the 15th would be Tuesday as well.</p>
<p>In the outlying areas they would celebrate Monday AND Tuesday as the holiday just to be certain that it was being celebrated at the right time. This became the established law during the time of the Talmud.</p>
<p>Today, we have a set calendar and there is no court to establish the new month via witnesses. There is no doubt as to which day is yom tov. So why do we celebrate the 2nd day in 2011?</p>
<p>Tablet correctly notes that since it was established in the Talmud as law we are bound to it. What they do not explain is why the Talmudic scholars may have done so.</p>
<p>There is significance to the fact that the very first mitzvah given to the Jewish people as a nation is the commandment to establish the new month. Many reasons and explanations are given. One of the more poignant proposals is that of R&#8217; Hirsch.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Hirsch compares the Jewish people to the moon. Just as the moon waxes and wanes, so too the Jewish people rise and fall. Sometimes we are up. sometimes we are down. Just as the moon reflects light from the sun, so too the Jewish people reflect the light of God and the Torah.</p>
<p>This comparison reminds us that we are constantly forming and reforming ourselves. The story is never over. Our choices can change who we are at any time. We are anything but complete.</p>
<p>Further, the power of the people to proclaim the new month, the requirement that the new month be established by the people serves as a constant reminder that we have so much power as human beings. We can control time and we must harness it to work for us.</p>
<p>This is an integral lesson for the Jewish people and the entire world. The Torah clearly wants us to master this life lesson as indicated by the very prominent place the Torah gives this commandment. It is the first commandment given to the Jewish people as a nation.</p>
<p>But how are we to integrate this lesson into our lives with action if the commandment to establish the new month with witnesses has become obsolete? If our calendar is set, we miss out on learning this valuable lesson.</p>
<p>It is for this reason, the rabbis established that we celebrate 2 days in the diaspora even when we no longer rely on witnesses to begin the new month. By keeping the 2nd day we remind ourselves of the important lessons of the moon and the important lessons of human beings establishing the new month. If we always kept one day, we would lose that opportunity. Forever. That would be tragic.</p>
<p>To make sure that this lesson remained part of the Jewish experience the rabbis of the Talmud mandated that we keep the 2nd day in the Diaspora. Even today.</p>
<p>I think that if we view the 2nd day as an opportunity for making these lessons real, we have a better chance of withstanding the temptation to dismiss the 2nd day. However if we view it as a quirk of history, a mistake as it were, then it is far too easy to do away with the 2nd day.</p>
<p>It is my hope that we can inspire each other to commit to the 2nd day with as much fervor, excitement and passion as the 1st day and use it is a springboard for greater personal growth through the years.</p>

<p>The chasidic town of New Square (an enclave that is very similar to KJ) has found itself in the news for all the wrong reasons. Last week an 18 year old goon attempted to burn down a man&#8217;s home along with the people inside the home. The target had been a victim of intimidation and vandalism on previous occasions so he had recently installed a surveillance system of cameras around his home. It was on these cameras that the victim first saw the goon. He went outside and confronted the goon.</p>
<p>A short brawl ensued and the goon lit his Molotov cocktail and fled. Both men caught on fire but the house was spared. The victim suffered severe burns all over his body and has already undergone skin grafts.</p>
<p>The arson and attempted murder were escalations of previous action against the victim. Prior to this incident he had been subject to protests in front of his home, broken windows in his car and his home.</p>
<p>What crime did the victim commit that sparked vandalism and violence?<span id="more-4297"></span></p>
<p>He prayed at an old age home nearby instead of praying in the community synagogue. The grand rabbi of New Square requires that all residents of New Square attend the same prayer service on Friday nights. The victim did not attend. The goons were enforcing the rabbi&#8217;s rule.</p>
<p>No one excuses the behavior of the goon. Social pressure is one thing, by violence is inexcusable. It would be unfair for me or anyone to place specific blame on anyone other than the goon who committed this act. There is no hard evidence that he was instructed to do what he did. There is some circumstantial evidence but for purposes of this article, it will be conceded that this person acted alone.</p>
<p>One response that I have seen on blogs, Twitter posts and Facebook comments is that the victim &#8220;had it coming&#8221;. (See: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/05/avi-shafran-on-new-square.html">Avi Shafran on New Square</a>) The village has a rule. He chose to live there and should expect that he will suffer some indignity for his failure to live by the standard of the village. Further, if he doesn&#8217;t like the rules, he should have left the village instead of staying AND breaking the rules.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this completely misses the point.</p>
<p>There was another scandal this week. The Head Football Coach at Ohio State University resigned amid a whirlwind of allegations that he assisted and enabled players to break the rules of NCAA. The players are being disciplined and their Head Coach, Jim Tressel has resigned and is being crucified in the media.</p>
<p>Jason Whitlock wrote a really great column about the scandal (<a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/Former-Ohio-State-coach-Jim-Tressel-is-product-of-flawed-system-053111" target="_blank">Tressel Product of Flawed System</a>). Whitlock contends, and I agree with him, that while Tressel is culpable for his sins, he is really just the product of a system built on lies. The primary lie being that student athletes are amateur. Whitlock has been saying forever, and I have been agreeing just as long, that the NCAA is the biggest fraud in America. They make billions of dollars off of these athletes but the athletes see none of that money. To maintain amateur status they must adhere to thousands of rules that basically prohibit them from taking any gifts or benefits from anybody.</p>
<p>Tressel was just part of the system. He didn&#8217;t create the problem. He didn&#8217;t make the problem worse. He was just a cog in a mighty machine. Indeed, he broke the rules. However the system is deeply flawed and everyone is breaking the rules that the real criminal here is not Tressel. It is the NCAA. [The same should be said for USC, Reggie Bush, OJ Mayo and Pete Carrol.]
<p>What happened in New Square is the result of a flawed system.</p>
<p>Any system that demands absolute fealty in every respect of one&#8217;s life, stripping one of independence and the opportunity to think and choose is a bad system. Any system that demonizes someone for asserting one smidgen of original thought is a bad system.</p>
<p>The perpetrators of violence and social terrorism are cogs in the machine. The machine is the problem. It isn&#8217;t the cogs.</p>
<p>To complete the analogy, the arsonist was a football player, the leadership is Jim Tressel and they are all part of a system like the NCAA.</p>
<p>The system needs to be fixed. The cogs are all responsible for their actions but the most frustrating thing is that their actions <em>are justifiable in the system.</em> That is why the system needs to be scrapped. It permits behavior like this to occur. This incident is only one example of a rotten system. There are more.</p>
<p>Maintaining control over people is not easy. But with per se poverty and social terror it becomes easier to enforce. That is part of the reason why the Kiryas Joel situation is so problematic. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/31/thoughts-on-kiryas-joel-the-poorest-city-in-america/">Thoughts on Kiryas Joel: The Poorest City in America</a>). It creates a breeding ground for anti-social behavior.</p>
<p>According to Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch the Torah is designed to create a positive social environment for growth and spiritual development. It can&#8217;t be that poverty, oppression, terror and anti-social behavior are the <em>darchei noam</em>, pleasant ways of the Torah. It just can&#8217;t.</p>

<p><strong>Adam, Eve and The Lesson of Marriage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breishis 5769</strong></p>
<p>Breishis is an incredible Parsha.  Of the many pertinent topics in this week’s Torah reading, I was immediately drawn to one specific area of the Parsha. The creation of a universe from nothing is quite an accomplishment. Of course for an all-powerful GD – it’s no big deal. But the ramifications of the creation are a big deal.</p>
<p>As we learn about the origins of our world, we encounter the logical steps of creation. <span id="more-1538"></span>In fact, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch points of that the six days of creation are really three pairs of days. On the first day GD created light and dark, on the second day oceans and celestial waters, and on the third day dry land.  Correspondingly, the fourth day is the culmination of the first day, so GD created luminaries to provide the light and energy for our world.  The fifth day featured all the water and sky-creatures that were created on the second day. The sixth day completes the creation of land that GD created on the third day by providing men and beasts to inhabit that land.  There is a specific order and logic to the process.</p>
<p>One step in the process, however, seems a bit halted. Each animal is created there in male and female forms.  Each creature has a partner. The system seems to make clear – in order to reproduce, two partners are necessary. Adam himself notes this point and suddenly realizes that the system has included all creatures, save for one – himself!  Imagine the confusion that must have set in when Adam discovered he was all alone in a very big world. It must have been quite disconcerting.  GD responds to Adam’s concerns by providing a partner for him as well.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us the process by which Adam was given a partner. GD originally had created man as a being that was male and female in one. The human was an asexual being and was not divided into two genders like other beings. This did not sit well with Adam; he felt lonely.   Then Eve was created from within Adam.  Eve was someone who had once been part of him but was now independent.  Why did GD arrange things this way? Why was the original plan to have one being? And when that plan failed, why was Eve merely fashioned from Adam’s spare parts? Something deeper must be going on here.</p>
<p>Additionally, we could ask what purpose Adam’s partner serves at all. If GD can do anything why did he create a system that requires two partners for reproduction? The system could have been more efficient if it was not necessary to involve a second party in reproduction. We can eat by ourselves, we can dress ourselves, we can earn a living by ourselves, and we can provide shelter by ourselves – so why can’t we reproduce by ourselves?</p>
<p>If we take a look at the text we find that GD blesses Adam and Eve as the verse states: ”Vayevarech Osam Elokim Vayomer Lahem, Pru, Urvu, Umilu es Haaretz Vikivshuha…” “And GD blessed them and said to them, reproduce, fill the land and conquer it.” Rav Hirsch offers a beautiful insight about this verse.  When GD blessed the fish in the seas with a similar bracha the text reads: “Veyavarech Osam Laymor, Pru Urvu” and so on. What is the difference between the two blessings? So Rav Hirsch explains that the word “Laymor” is the key.  “Laymor” connotes an automatic execution of GD’s will, meaning that if GD gives a blessing using the word Laymor it is more of an expression that GD wills the result of the blessing to occur as a fact of nature. It is due to HIS will and thus the fulfillment of the blessing is automatically given. The creatures in the water were blessed, by default, with tremendous powers of multiplication. In contrast, when GD blessed Adam and Eve it says, “Vayomer Lahem” which connotes a blessing that gives us the free will to fulfill the blessing. This is what separates us from the beasts. Reproduction is a function of our free will.  As Rav Hirsch puts it, “That which in animals is a purely physical act becomes in man a free-willed moral act.” And with this charge of “Pru Urvu” GD delivers the four-fold mission of the moral development of the entire human race.</p>
<p>There are four steps to this blessing / commandment. 1) “Pru” is the marriage, the physical opportunity to produce offspring.  Just as in beasts and plants the traits of the parents are transferred to the offspring, in mankind the spiritual traits of the parents are transferred to the children. This is what is colloquially known as being fruitful!</p>
<p>2) “Revu” is the family. We already see that physical increase of humans is more than a numbers game. There is a family aspect as well, which means that the role of the parent continues even after the child is born. The task of all parents is to provide a spiritual, moral education to their children. Only by carrying out this duty does the calling of “Pru” attain its high moral significance.</p>
<p>3) The word “Milu” is society. As humans populate earth, the blessing and demand to reproduce turns to a social requirement to watch out for the welfare of our fellow humans.</p>
<p>4) “Kivshuha” is property, which implies mastering the physical world in which we live for the furtherance of human goals.  Acquiring wealth to provide the environment to accomplish these goals we have set forth is acceptable and is even admirable if done with the proper intent. Forming a physical home to raise a family to impart the values and morals we have discussed is the 4th step.</p>
<p>By these instructions in the creation story, GD has provided the basic instructions for all of society. But there is more. Is there an aspect to marriage that helps us to serve GD better? Or is it merely the condition that helps us fulfill the requirement to be fruitful?</p>
<p>We were created in the image of GD. One thing that this means is that our lives and the lessons of our lives can be applied to our relationship with GD. Many of the mitzvos are designed to help us connect with GD directly. However, there are other mitzvos that we can use as guides to learn how to connect with GD on our own. It can be hard to have a relationship with an all-knowing GD and He knows that. That is why he gave us marriage. It is a great analogy to our relationship with Him. In a marriage the two partners are connected at all times. Each one’s actions reflects directly upon the other. Similarly, in our relationship with GD, He is always with us and everything that we do reflects upon Him.</p>
<p>The implications of this idea are huge. Marriage is practice for our relationship with GD. There is much to learn from one’s marriage to one’s relationship with GD. For example. unconditionally loving one’s spouse no matter how we feel or how our day went can be tough, but it is good practice for times when we may not feel very inspired in our spiritual relationship with GD. Using this approach it is important for us to consider marriage and all our relationships using this  four-step model: reproduction, family, society, and mastery over the material world. We need to consider the takeaway lesson of the 4th step, that is to use our resources, opportunities and material possessions to grow spiritually</p>
