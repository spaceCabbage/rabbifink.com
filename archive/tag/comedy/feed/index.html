				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/angus_t_jones_blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6546" title="angus_t_jones_blog" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/angus_t_jones_blog-195x300.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="300" /></a>There is a very lowbrow television show called Two and Half Men. It used to star Charlie Sheen, but he went off the reservation. Ashton Kutsher took over for Sheen. But the other two stars have been there since the start. Believe it or not, despite capitalizing on bathroom humor, objectification of women, and recycling its own jokes, Two and Half Men is the #1 comedy on TV every year and it makes zillions of dollars. (What does that say about American culture?)</p>
<p>The stars of the show make upwards of $350,000 per 30 minute episode. Angus T. Jones is the actor who plays the youngest member of the household. He is a very, very wealthy young man.</p>
<p>Recently he has been doing some soul searching. Apparently making millions did not satisfy Mr. Jones, he needed some spirituality in his life. So he joined a black Mega Church in Atlanta that is Seventh Day Adventist (my favorite kind of Christians), where a man named The Forerunner preaches about the ills of today&#8217;s society. The Forerunner did a two part video of Angus T. Jones&#8217; Testimony. This is Mega-Church-Speak for one&#8217;s story of how they found Jesus.</p>
<p>If you want to hear Angus&#8217;s story click the YouTube link at the bottom of the post. Fascinating stuff.</p>
<p>But there is one quote in there that has become newsworthy.<span id="more-6545"></span> Angus says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;If you watch &#8216;Two and a Half Men&#8217;, please stop watching &#8216;Two and a Half Men,&#8217; I&#8217;m on &#8216;Two and a Half Men&#8217; and I don&#8217;t want to be on it. If I am doing any harm, I don&#8217;t want to be here. I don&#8217;t want to be contributing to the enemy&#8217;s plan&#8230; You cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like that. I&#8217;m not okay with what I&#8217;m learning, what the Bible says and being on that television show.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Now this set off a bit of a firestorm. Angus has since apologized and all seems okay at this point.</p>
<p>The question I have is whether Angus should be working on a show that he feels goes against his morals. If he feels that it is such a disgraceful show, how can he not be a hypocrite if he still acts on the show?</p>
<p>Perhaps the fact that he is under contract makes fulfilling the terms of his obligation the morally correct thing to do. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>It just seems so disingenuous to talk about not wanting to be on the show and then being on the show. No one is forcing him. He should have the strength to act upon his convictions. If it&#8217;s really so bad (and apparently it is) he should put his money where his mouth is, and quit.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&#8217;s just a lot talk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ObamaSilvermanAd_6721738.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6330" title="ObamaSilvermanAd_6721738" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/ObamaSilvermanAd_6721738-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>As far as I know, Rabbi Yaakov Rosenblatt is a lovely fellow. Unfortunately, he ran into some trouble over the last few days. <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/opinions/dear-sarah-silverman/2012/10/11/0/" target="_blank">After he published an open letter to Sarah Silverman in the Jewish Press</a>, and Sarah&#8217;s father responded quite forcefully in the comments, Jezebel found the whole thing more than a bit entertaining and made Rabbi Rosenblatt look like a moron.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start at the beginning.</p>
<p>Sarah Silverman is a Jewish comic. She is crude, not really that funny in my opinion, and only mildly entertaining when she is not trying to be too shocking. She did a little YouTube video telling black, Latino, old, and young people to make sure they register to vote. The title of the video is &#8220;Let my people vote&#8221;. The video is crude and as per usual full of colorful language. But the message is completely innocuous. Her message is to register to vote, or at least to get a firearm license. I think we all agree that registering to vote is a message we can all get behind.</p>
<p>Rabbi Rosenblatt takes offense to Sarah Silverman&#8217;s very existence it seems, but his excuse for writing his &#8220;open letter&#8221; to her is because the title of her video was &#8220;framed in biblical language&#8221;. For the life of me, I cannot comprehend how using a phrase that is based on a loosely translated verse from the bible is sufficient cause to rant against someone, but apparently it works for Rabbi Rosenblatt.</p>
<p>The rant speaks for itself. It is an anti-feminist, pro-baby making diatribe. I am not going to comment further on the appropriateness of his comment that Sarah Silverman should just have some babies already and stop worrying about politics. You can read it and the comments for yourself.<span id="more-6329"></span></p>
<p>All the publicity surrounding this letter is definitely not good PR for Jews and certainly a stain on the already suffering public reputation of orthodox Jews. Even if Sarah Silverman would have read the letter and decided that Rabbi Rosenblatt was correct in everything he said, it seems dubious to assume that this letter would be a <em>kiddush Hashem </em>of some sort. That&#8217;s another discussion as well.</p>
<p>What I do want to discuss is the theological underpinning of Rabbi Rosenblatt&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p>The first theological statement is this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>You have made a career making public that which is private, making crude that which is intimate, making sensual that which is spiritual. You have experienced what traditional Judaism taught long ago: when you make sex a public thing it loses its potency. When the whisper is replaced with a shout there is no magic to speak about. And, in my opinion, Sarah, that is why you have had trouble forging a permanent relationship – the most basic desire of the feminine soul.</em></p>
<p>Both men and women have a basic desire to forge deep relationships. I am not sure if either men or women want to forge a permanent relationship so badly that it could be called the most basic desire. But more importantly, I know of no reason to connect one&#8217;s willingness to keep intimacy private with one&#8217;s ability to create a relationship. But most importantly, Sarah Silverman has had some pretty long term relationships in her life already. Kudos to her. Just because she hasn&#8217;t tied the knot doesn&#8217;t mean she can&#8217;t attempt to make a permanent relationship. Dating is not permanent. Relationships are not permanent. Marriage is not permanent either.</p>
<p>Then this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>As an Orthodox rabbi, I disagree with just about everything you say, but respect your right to say it. All I ask, respectfully, is that you not use traditional Jewish terminology in your efforts. Because doing so is a lie.</em></p>
<p>The issue at stake here is whether one should register to vote. I am unsure why Rabbi Rosenblatt would disagree with this. As I said earlier, I see no reason Sarah Silverman should refrain from using traditional Jewish terminology. It&#8217;s not offensive to use &#8220;Let my people vote&#8221; as a take off on &#8220;Let my people go.&#8221; I don&#8217;t see how it can be. It certainly is not a lie.</p>
<p>And finally this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Marriage and children will change the way you see the world. It will allow you to appreciate the stability that Judaism, the religion of your ancestors, espouses. And it will allow you to understand and appreciate the traditional lifestyle’s peace, security, and respect for human dignity&#8230;</em></p>
<p> Marriage and children definitely change the way one sees the world. But I find it offensive to presume that only a married parent can find their way in Judaism. Anyone can appreciate Judaism. You don&#8217;t need to be married and a parent. God does not even require women to get married or have children in the Torah. Why does Rabbi Rosenblatt?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE </strong>(thanks to Rabbi Bronstein in the comments for helping me to see this): One more thing. It speaks to a grave misapprehension regarding mental illness and motherhood to suggest that a depressed woman have children to cure her depression. Is Rabbi Rosenblatt taking responsibility for the welfare of Sarah Silverman&#8217;s children? Depression is real. And there is an archaic attitude toward depression in the frum community that somehow thinks that having children is the cure for everything from marital issues to depression. Not good.</p>
<p>Personally, I think a public apology and retraction is in order. I see no justification for the letter nor do I see any justification for the theology behind the letter. I hope Rabbi Rosenblatt does the right thing. Hopefully it can begin to heal the wounds created by his open letter.</p>
<p><strong><em>Warning: There is plenty of strong adult language in the comments on the Jewish Press site and only more on Jezebel and even more yet in the video in question.</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_120411.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2160" title="Heshy Fried / Frum Satire at Pacific Jewish Center the Shul on the Beach" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG_12041-300x225.jpg" alt="Frum Satire at PJC" width="240" height="180" /></a>Wow.</p>
<p><a href="http://frumsatire.net" target="_blank">Heshy Fried aka Frum Satire</a> performed in front of a very diverse crowd of ~60 at the Pacific Jewish Center at the Shul on the Beach on Sunday February 14 2010 and it was incredible.</p>
<p>Heshy ranted for over an hour and the audience was captivated. He could have gone on for another hour and had everyone laughing all the way through.</p>
<p>I introduced Heshy and the show with an important message.<span id="more-2155"></span> Judaism, in many ways has become more about idiosyncrasies and self-defining labels than substance, lately. Sometimes we need a keen satirist to remind us that most of that stuff is just silliness. We need to remember what the important things are and when Heshy cuts through &#8220;all the other stuff&#8221; with his wit and comedic genius, what remains is what is real.</p>
<p>So, I concluded, that is why I read Frum Satire and that is why I am honored to introduce all of you to the stylings of Frum Satire.</p>
<p>Heshy touched on so many great topics. Crazy shidduch resumes, messing with BTs, not looking yeshivish, kiddush techniques and many more hilarious anecdotes and observations were satired. The crowd loved it all. Laughing for an hour can hurt your face. I found that out after the show.</p>
<p>Heshy&#8217;s humor is clean and still manages to be very funny. Kudos!</p>
<p>Those who came to the show were so happy they did. Those who missed the show missed out on some great fun. We also met a bunch of new people to our shul who had never been inside before. It was a pleasure to meet you all!</p>
<p>I want to thank Heshy for making the Shul on the Beach his first West Coast show. We had a great time over Shabbos and the Sunday evening show. Come back and visit soon!</p>
<p>I edited a 7 minute portion of the show (just a few minutes from the beginning of the show) for your viewing pleasure. (I had no tripod and the camera was my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SER47Y?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001SER47Y">Canon PowerShot SD 780 IS</a> so please excuse the shakes.) Enjoy.</p>
