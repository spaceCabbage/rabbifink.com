				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>At the amazing Pacific Jewish Center Chanukah party yesterday, I spoke about using stories to keep our Judaism vibrant. After all, the Torah and Talmud are books of law but are replete with stories. Chanukah in particular is only told through stories as it is not mentioned in Tanach and the scant references in the Mishnah don&#8217;t inform us of the day&#8217;s obligations. Our knowledge of the day comes only thought stories. Even Maimonides, in his Mishneh Torah, which is devoid of storytelling for the most part, tells the story of Chanukah. So I urged everyone to tell Chanukah stories in their homes and add some warmth to the Mitzvahs of the day.<span id="more-7920"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/timthumb.php_.jpeg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7921" alt="timthumb.php" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/timthumb.php_-600x399.jpeg" width="480" height="319" /></a>After the talk, Vladimir Skomarovsky told me his (true) Chanukah story.</p>
<p>From December 1941 to liberation in 1944, Vladimir and his mother were in hiding. They lived the catacombs of Odessa with other Jewish people who escaped the Holocaust by fleeing to the caves with their lives.</p>
<p>The catacombs of Odessa are an extensive network of underground caves.They are about 200 years old and the catacombs were home to many refugees escaping the Nazis.</p>
<p>On Chanukah they had no oil or candles, or could simply ill afford to consume valuable fuel to kindle the Chanukah lights. When it came time to light Chanukah candles, everyone in the cave would pick up rocks. In concert, they would scratch the shape of a candle into the cave wall. The first night they would carve candle number one, on the second night they would carve candle number two, and so it would be for eight days.</p>
<p>They could not light Chanukah candles with fire but the fire in their souls inspired them to keep the flame of Chanukah alive with their Chanukah menorah carvings deep in the catacombs of Odessa.</p>
<p>Vladimir celebrates Chanukah with candles of wax and oil today. But the spirit of his experience in the catacombs of Odessa lives on in his soul.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.559378" target="_blank">The purists insist</a> that Chanukah is a holiday that celebrates a victory against assimilation. They find this ironic because Chanukah is celebrated by so many assimilated Jews who don’t even realize that they are celebrating a holiday about winning a war against their spiritual ancestors. <a href="http://haaretz.com/jewish-world/rabbis-round-table/.premium-1.560152" target="_blank">In Haaretz I argued</a> that this is irrelevant and new meanings to holidays can be perfectly acceptable in Orthodox Judaism and it’s wrong to begrudge our fellows Jews an opportunity to participate in a holiday.</p>
<p>After a bit more thought, I am not so sure that the victory was in fact against assimilation and assimilators per se. The true purpose of the war was to liberate the Temple and re-establish autonomy so that the Jewish people could practice their God-given religion unfettered.<span id="more-7903"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1298383772_11-e1385626617988.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7904" alt="1298383772_11" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1298383772_11-e1385626617988-600x475.jpg" /></a>The Syrian-Greek occupiers made laws that prevented Jewish people from following the word of God. Many people willingly gave up their Judaism and integrated into the foreign culture. These people completely assimilated our of fear.</p>
<p>The Maccabees and their followers were religious zealots who knew that if the Syrian-Greeks were not pushed out of the land, Judaism would have been lost. The lives of those who were living by the Torah were at risk. Whoever disobeyed the prohibitions against Judaism was to be killed. At one point, the Maccabees were threatened with death. It was then that Matisyahu was filled with the passion to wage a war for the sake of their religious beliefs. They took upon themselves the responsibility to evict the Syrian-Greeks from the Temple and to restore their religious freedom.</p>
<p>That is what the war was about. It’s true that when the Maccabees conquered areas within the Land of Israel they would return the citizens of each city and town to observance, however that does not mean that the actual war was for the purpose of un-assimilating the assimilated. It was a collateral benefit for sure, but it was not the objective. The objectives were autonomy, religious freedom, and the Temple.</p>
<p>The war was won when those three objectives were secured. The Book of Maccabees tells us very little about the Hellenized Jews living in the Land of Israel after the Maccabees had vanquished the Syrian-Greeks. Apparently, it was not an important fact to report. The battles were important. Winning the war was important.</p>
<p>So when we look at Chanukah through this lens, I am no longer convinced that the war was a civil war between Traditional and Hellenized Jews as it has been presented. It was a battle for the right to practice as Traditional Jews. The Hellenized Jews were apathetic to the goals of the Maccabee, and the Maccabees did what they could to restore the glory of Torah and Mitzvos to the Hellenists. But to make the entire story about defeating assimilation and assimilated Jews is not true to the story. Perhaps without a Meccabeean victory, total assimilation would have been inevitable, however there is no indication that anyone was pushing Traditional Jews to assimilate other than the Syrian-Greeks and other than through threat to life.</p>
<p>One can certainly argue that the meaning of the holiday should be informed by the staunch anti-assimilation stance the Maccabees took. It’s certainly possible. But is it the only interpretation of the story? Certainly not. Is it a tenet of our faith or a necessary component to the celebration of the holiday to hold that the war was not really a physical struggle, but a spiritual struggle and the real enemy was not the Syrian-Greeks, rather it was the Hellenists? Hardly. Is it still ironic if secular or marginally religious Jews celebrate Chanukah? I don’t think so.<br />
The holiday celebrates the restoration of the incredible opportunity to serve God as we were commanded. It was not merely a celebration of staving off assimilation. It was much more than that and focusing on assimilation detracts from the more prominent aspects of the story. And so, I think that if assimilated Jews are celebrating their sort of Chanukah despite their assimilation, they are more like the Maccabees than the Hellenized Jews. They are not allowing themselves to completely disappear. They are not identifying with the Syrian-Greeks who lost the war, nor the Hellenists who played at most a secondary role during the Chanukah story. Indeed, they identify with the Maccabees by celebrating a Jewish religious holiday while steeped in a very seductive American culture. There is nothing ironic or foolish about that. Nothing at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/rabbis-round-table/.premium-1.560152" target="_blank">This article was originally published on Haaretz.com</a>. It is reproduced with their permission here:</em></p>
<p><em></em>Hanukkah has become an iconic holiday. In many ways, it has become as well known and popular as Christmas. But what exactly is its message?</p>
<p>The origins of Hanukkah are mired in obscurity. The rabbis of the Talmud established the days of Hanukkah as a commemoration for a small jug of oil that burned for eight days instead of burning for one day, as expected. Religious zeal and fervor were the themes of the first Hanukkah. For much of Jewish history, and for much of Orthodox Judaism today, the holiday retains much of its Talmudic meaning. Hanukkah is like a wink from a hidden God reminding us that when we stand up for our Judaism, God is standing with us.<span id="more-7914"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/185367.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7915" alt="185367" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/185367.jpg" /></a>This is not a very pluralistic message. It’s also not the way that most people look at Hanukkah today. Many people see that holiday as a celebration of religious freedom. Others see it as a beautiful way of competing with more popular holidays like Christmas. Yet others consider the military struggle for autonomy the central focus of the day.</p>
<p>Purists might <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.559378" target="_blank">recoil at the thought</a> that the Talmudic intent behind the holiday is being ignored or even changed.  I don’t think this is a valid concern.</p>
<p>Jewish holidays have multiple layers of meaning, often depending on time and place. During the First Temple period the holiday of Sukkot was a harvest holiday. Most Jewish people don’t celebrate the harvest aspect of the holiday anymore. Passover has meant different things to different people as well. It started as a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt. For many people throughout the long exile it has come to symbolize our yearning to return to the Land of Israel and a Messianic utopia.</p>
<p>Even within the somewhat narrow confines of Orthodox Judaism, Hasidut added new elements and meaning to our holidays. We have a longstanding tradition of reinterpreting Jewish holidays.</p>
<p>There may be no starker historical example of this reinterpretation than Hanukkah itself. Maccabees I and Maccabees II provide their own reasons for the holiday. No miracle of oil is found in these texts. Josephus also neglects to mention this miracle. These sources focus primarily on the military victory.</p>
<p>It is pretty clear that the rabbis of the Talmud sought to refocus the day from a military victory and its attendant zealotry in favor of the commemoration of a miracle of a small cruse of oil. The Talmud glosses over the military victory in its description of the holiday.</p>
<p><em>“What is Chanukkah? That [which] our Sages taught: On the 25th of Kislev &#8211; the days of Chanukkah, they are eight, not to eulogize on them and not to fast on them, for when the Greeks entered the Temple, they polluted all the oils in the Temple, and when the Hasmonean dynasty overcame and defeated them, they checked and they found but one cruse of oil that was set in place with the seal of the High Priest, but there was in only [enough] to light a single day. A miracle was done with it, and they lit from it for eight days. The following year [the Sages] fix those [days], making them holidays for praise and thanksgiving.”</em> (Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 21A, Translation from Sefaria.org)</p>
<p>In the Talmud, the military victory is presented merely as incidental to the miracle of the oil. There was no miraculous victory and winning the war was not worth celebrating on its own in their view. The rabbis of the Talmud may be said to have started the tradition of reinterpreting the Hanukkah story.</p>
<p>Medieval commentaries asked why Hanukkah is eight days if the miracle was only for seven days? There was enough oil for one day! One day was natural and seven days were miracles, so we should celebrate seven days of miracle. One commentary reinterprets the military victory as a miracle to answer this famous question. Another reinterpretation. This time in nearly direct opposition to the Talmud’s version.</p>
<p>Reinterpretation is all part of the Hanukkah story. As long as the message is consistent with the ideals of Judaism and serve to help maintain a connection to the essence of the holiday, we should embrace new ideas. Orthodox Jews may insist that the laws of rabbinic Judaism are incontrovertible, and in our view they are, but the message and meaning of our holidays have long been much more fluid. If today’s Hanukkah message can be transformed to a more unifying and inspirational day for more Jews, so be it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>It&#8217;s understandable that Orthodox Judaism is reluctant to endorse academic approaches to Torah. The basic assumptions of Orthodox Judaism are in direct opposition to the basic assumptions of academic research. We believe God gave the Torah. We believe the Oral Law is the interpretation of the written Torah and it is equally binding. Academics assume none of that. The entire purpose of academic research is to approach the texts with zero assumptions and arrive where the pure analysis leads. Often these two approaches will lead to opposite results and this is not acceptable in Orthodox Judaism. We can&#8217;t be undermining our own religion.</p>
<p>I think there is an exception to this policy. The exception is Chanukah. No one thinks Chanukah is Divine. No one thinks that God commanded us to celebrate Chanukah. Everyone knows that the holiday was instituted by the Maccabees and was subsequently established by Megilas Taanis and then by the rabbis of the Babylonian Talmud as a holiday to be celebrated every year. So the worst thing that could happen if we follow the academic path is that we might find inconsistencies in the story or in the reasons for the rabbinic commandments of the holiday. But because we already assume it is not Divine, the potential harm from merging our traditional understanding with the academic view is minimal.<span id="more-7866"></span><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IRHT_126277-p.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7868" alt="IRHT_126277-p" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IRHT_126277-p-600x398.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>At most, we might discover that the version of the story according to the Talmud is not the only version of the story. What&#8217;s the harm in that? We are required to keep the holiday because of their power of Beis Din HaGadol, not because what they said is objectively factually true. If it turns out that they had one understanding of the story that is not corroborated by the historical evidence it wouldn&#8217;t make an ounce of a difference to us. We would still have to keep the holiday as commanded by the rabbis of the Talmud. If you disagree, stop reading.</p>
<p>With the preamble out of the way, I think it&#8217;s safe to dive right in.</p>
<p>The Chanukah story occurred between 167 BCE and 165 BCE. We have two apocryphal books describing the events of the Chanukah story. 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees were written within 50 years of the revolt. Megilas Taanis was written a century later, followed shortly thereafter by Josephus&#8217;s Antiquities. In all four of these texts we are told about the Chanukah story and the establishment of a yearly celebration.</p>
<p>In 1 Maccabees we are told that the celebration was for the restoration of the daily sacrifices in the Temple and the general rededication of the sanctuary. Hence the name Chanukah; a celebration of the dedication, as <span style="font-size: medium;">חנך</span> means to dedicate. 2 Maccabees echoes the same sentiments and adds that the first Chanukah celebration was a reflection of the Sukkos celebration of 8 days that they had been unable to celebrate a few months earlier because of the war.</p>
<p>Megilas Taanis simply proclaims the 25th of Kislev a holiday and it is forbidden to mourn for 8 days. The text does not give a reason for the celebration. Josephus slightly editorializes the version of 1 Maccabees in his work. But he adds the first reference we find to the idea of lights being associated with the Holiday:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days, [...] they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of the restoration of their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was, because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The Babylonian Talmud famously asks &#8220;What is Chanukah?&#8221; The response is the quote from Megilas Taanis followed by an unsourced version of the Chanukah story that is familiar to Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;for when the Greeks entered the Temple, they polluted all the oils in the Temple, and when the Hasmonean dynasty overcame and defeated them, they checked and they found but one cruse of oil that was set in place with the seal of the High Priest, but there was in only [enough] to light a single day. A miracle was done with it, and they lit from it for eight days. The following year [the Sages] fix those [days], making them holidays for praise and thanksgiving.”</em> (Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 21A, Translation from Sefaria.org)</p>
<p>This may or may not have also been the version of the story according to the scholia (commentary) of Megilas Taanis. The original scholia was likely written between the writing of Megilas Taanis and the Talmud. A hybrid of two fairly early versions of the scholia seems to have the same story. It&#8217;s quoted by the Ohr Zarua (1260) in this manner. However, the foremost expert on the scholium is convinced (and for good reason) that the original commentary on Megilas Taanis does not contain the same version as the Talmud. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_HUCA73_Noam_v07.pdf" target="_blank">Vered Noam</a>) From what I have seen, it seems that this expert is correct.</p>
<p>So what we have is a very clear summary of the various explanations for the celebration of Chanukah. The most popular version is probably the Talmud&#8217;s explanation. Everyone &#8220;knows&#8221; that the small jug of oil was only supposed to last for one day and miraculously lasted for eight days. The popular English name for Chanukah is not &#8220;Dedication&#8221; rather it&#8217;s the Festival of Lights. Let&#8217;s assume the miracle occurred. It was not latched onto as a reason for celebration by the Maccabees. Nor was it a popular reason for the celebration at the time of Josephus. Although it&#8217;s safe to assume that candles were lit as part of the celebration of the holiday at the time of the Mishnah (and Josephus) as the Mishnah in Bava Kamma exempts someone from paying damages if a fire was started by outdoor Chanukah candles. Obviously, people lit candles and one was permitted to leave these lights outside the home on Chanukah. Further, as noted above, Josephus called the Chanukah the &#8220;Festival of Lights.&#8221; Still, there was no particular importance attached to this miracle until the rabbis of the Talmud.</p>
<p>I have a few thoughts on all this plus one thought that I choose to keep to myself for now.</p>
<p>First, 1 Maccabees follows the pattern of the Purim story. God is hidden throughout the story. There is no mention of God in the narrative. Heaven is used as a euphemism for God, but even then, God plays no active role. This is what we would expect from a story that took place after the Purim story. God&#8217;s name is omitted from Megilas Esther because God is hidden from them. Purim reinforces the concept of a hidden God pulling the strings from &#8220;afar&#8221; and arranging events to meet a specific end. It was always strange to me that Chanukah seems to revert to the pre-Purim sort of special event with an overt miracle. Further, what&#8217;s the point of this miracle? It was completely unnecessary and completely besides the point of the story. So it makes sense that a miracle would not be the focus of their narrative. The book was written like the Purim story with a focus on the man-made events with God&#8217;s tacit approval. Perhaps the sources up to the Talmud were following this pattern.</p>
<p>Second, there is a lot of speculation about why the laws of Chanukah were omitted from the Mishnah by R&#8217; Yehuda HaNasi. Whatever the reason, it was omitted. R&#8217; Yehuda HaNasi needed a <em>&#8220;heter&#8221;</em> to write down the Mishnah. His justification was that if it wouldn&#8217;t be written down, it would be forgotten. To me that means that whatever was not written down is subject to forgetfulness. Yes, there are those who try to say that the reason it was not written down was because it was so widely known, but I don&#8217;t think that fits. So it&#8217;s okay to assume that because it was not written down it might have been forgotten and the rabbis of the Talmud were using the lapse in memory to reinterpret the holiday for their own reasons. There are other examples of things being forgotten and reestablished in the Talmud. Of course, there is plenty of speculation on the reason the rabbis of the Talmud may have wanted to refocus the holiday on a God-made miracle as opposed to a Hasmonean military victory, and I have written some of my thoughts on that issue here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/12/the-chanukah-story-a-cautionary-tale-of-extremism-gone-wrong/" target="_blank">Chanukah 2012</a>. But most importantly, it seems that just about everyone who celebrates Chanukah, including non-Orthodox Jews, go with the Talmudic version of the story. That&#8217;s no small victory for the rabbis of the Talmud.</p>
<p>Third, the rabbis may have been tapping into something else in the rabbinic tradition. That is, the Talmud in Avodah Zara expanding on an idea found in Pirkei d&#8217;Rabbi Elazar states that Adam lit candles on the 25th of Kislev as it coincided with the Winter Solstice. Adam was banished from the Garden of Eden in the fall and watched as the nights grew longer and longer each coming day. He feared that that the pattern would continue until the sun would be completely hidden from earth. On the Winter Solstice he discovered that he was mistaken and the light would return so he lit candles. Lighting candles seems to be something so basic to this time of year that it makes sense that it would have become the focus of the Chanukah celebration. Even the biggest non-Jewish holiday of the year takes place this time of year and would seem to have nothing to do with lights. Yet, trees are lit up across the world. Lights are inescapable this time of year and it seems that the rabbis of the Talmud leveraged this for the benefit of Chanukah.</p>
<p>Regardless of the pre-Talmudic reasons given for the holiday, Orthodox Jews make the blessings on the candles because the rabbis of the Talmud had the authority to establish this holiday based on Megilas Taanis. Nothing that has been discussed here jeopardizes anything of significance. And so, we get to enjoy the academic study of the origins of Chanukah risk free.</p>
<p>When we light our candles this year we will be connecting ourselves to a chain of generations who lit candles, sometimes under extreme duress, to celebrate Chanukah. Let us hope that the fire of the Chanukah candles inspires us to light up the night of our exile and vanquish the negative forces in our personal temples of spirituality as they were vanquished from our public Temple 2200 years ago.</p>

The party featured delicious Chanukah foods and treats, dreidel contests, a moon bounce for the kids, entertainment for everyone courtesy of Derek the Mime a speech from the rabbi and most of all, lovely company.</p>
<p>As usual, the party was open to the Pacific Jewish Center community and to the public as part of our Outreach on the Beach programming. The community was well represented with an excellent showing at the party. With our doors wide open at on Venice Boardwalk we also met and made many old and new friends. People who had been in the shul before returned this afternoon. One woman had been in the shul in the 50&#8242;s and had not been back since. Others were old friends who were part of our community for many years before moving on. It was so nice to see them all. We also met many new people. Some were local Jewish residents who had just never had a chance to come to shul and others were travelers and tourists, some Jewish and some not at all.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful afternoon. We thank everyone who came and who contributed to the festive and celebratory atmosphere.</p>
<p>If you missed the party, you can listen to my speech here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/25/chanukah-2011-address-what-doomed-the-hasmoneans/" target="_blank">What Doomed the Hasmoneans?</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/shamash_drip.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4975" title="shamash_drip" alt="" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/shamash_drip-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>Separation of Church and State is widely regarded as a modern concept. For most of the world this is an accurate assessment. In some places in the world there remains no separation. What I mean by a separation between church and state is that quite simply there are two different and exclusive bodies that legislate religion and politics. Political leadership is vested in one person or group and religious considerations are seen to by a different person or group.</p>
<p>In the United States, I believe separation of church and state is a misnomer. It&#8217;s not that there is a separation as much as the state has no opinion on religion. I think that a truer version of a separation between church and state originated with ancient Judaism.</p>
<p>The law was that the political leadership of the Jewish people flowed through the Davidic family of the tribe of Judah. The religious leaders in ancient Israel were the priests and the Levites who were are members of the tribe of Levi. These two groups were separate. This separation of powers was to ensure that no group had absolute power. It created a balance between political and domestic interests and religious interests. It was a good system and I believe the model for today&#8217;s separation.<span id="more-4974"></span></p>
<p>The story of Chanukah tells the tale of the Hasmonean family rebelling against the oppressive Seleucid-Greeks. This family was a priestly family. They sough to restore honor and holiness to the Temple. They also sought political autonomy from the Seleucid-Greeks.</p>
<p>They won both.</p>
<p>At that moment that they won they should have appointed a Davidic heir to the throne. But they failed to do so. A Hasmonean was anointed king and this began a slow fall from grace for the Hasmoneans. Not one Hasmonean remained after several generations of intermarriage and intra-violence. The Rabbis of the Talmudic era cite their error in taking the throne as the reason for their ultimate colossal failure.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Hasmoneans did not separate church and state. They were the kings and the priests at the same time and carried absolute power. As time has proven time and time again, absolute power corrupts absolutely. The Hasmoneans ended up in the scrap heap of history because of their failure in this regard.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of candles on our Chanukah menorah. There are the candles that we light each light. On the first night we light one and the second night we light two and we continue adding candles for eight night. By lighting these candles we fulfill a religious obligation to light these candles as instituted by the great rabbis of the Mishnah. We light candles and create holiness.</p>
<p>However there is another candle. The shamash is the candle we use to light the nightly candles. It does not factor into the religious nightly lighting. It is a functional candle, not a holy candle. It is a candle whose name, shamash can mean &#8220;caretaker&#8221;. The shamash is the lighter. But it is not the candle of the mitzvah.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the requirement that we use a shamash was a wink from the rabbis of the Mishnah reminding us why the Hasmoneans were such a disaster. They did not separate the political from the religious. The functional and holy were too closely intertwined. The political leaders were from the same family as the religious leaders.</p>
<p>Chanukah remembers their initial success but the lighting of the Chanukah candles reminds us of their ultimate failure. They did not separate church and state. On our Chanukah menorah we do separate church and state. We light holy candles to do a mitzvah. We light those candles with a separate, purely functional candle.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not quite sure how to relate this idea to contemporary Chanukah celebrations and the current state of Jewish affairs. But I am pretty sure there is a message in there that reminds us that sometimes we and our leaders need to hear alternative voices. That a <em>kinas sofrim</em> among Jews is a good thing and helps us fine tune our personal observance. There cannot be just one way, with one leadership, with one set of ideas. There must be multiple voices. There can&#8217;t be absolute power because is absolutely corrupts. Just ask as the shamash.</p>

We are located right on the edge of Venice near the Santa Monica border. Many of our Shul members live in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>So, it is fair to say I have spent these last two Chanukahs in Santa Monica. Sure it&#8217;s different from Northeast. We never will have a &#8220;white Chanukah&#8221;. We had our Chanukah party on the beach with a moon-bounce outside. People are wearing shorts. It was 73 degrees today. It feels a little different, but we&#8217;re not complaining.</p>
<p>Turns out, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer" target="_blank">Tom Lehrer</a> agrees with me. Chanukah is way better in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll tell you about it himself, just watch this&#8230;<span id="more-1935"></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1868" href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-photos/menorah/"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1868" title="menorah" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/menorah-300x259.jpg" alt="menorah" width="180" height="155" /></a>The 2009 PJC Chanukah Party was a tremendous success.</p>
<p>As the Shul on the Beach, a community institution, we are charged with the responsibility and opportunity to bring Judaism to the boardwalk. Our Chanukah party, the first in a series of events and programs designed to reach that end was incredible.</p>
<p>Thank yous are in order to Jeff Liss for organizing, planning and executing the whole thing. Thank you so much. Many others contributed as well and for that we express our appreciation to you as well.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing how many people came through our doors today,<span id="more-1866"></span>but it was a very large number. Rabbi Mintz was particularly effective at luring passers by into the shul. Thank you so much! The shul was packed with community members as well as many passers-by ranging from observant friends to completely unaffiliated Jews as well as many curious non-Jews.</p>
<p>I had the fortune of meeting some wonderful people. Like the father of an adorable daughter whose expectant wife was home. He thought a Chanukah Party would be the perfect way for this non-Jewish father to celebrate with his Jewish daughter. He noted, that as soon as possible, he will be bringing his wife and, God-willing, twin daughters, when mom and babies are up and about. He cited the generosity and friendliness of the community members as impressive.</p>
<p>I met people from all over Los Angeles. Locals, from Santa Monica and Venice. From all over Los Angeles from as far as the Valley to Marina del Rey. I met visitors from Chicago, New Jersey, Miami, Israel and the UK. It was truly a universal Chanukah celebration.</p>
<p>Once inside everyone was treated to warm hospitality, friendliness and traditional Chanukah foods. (Of course there was food.) Towards the end of the party I spoke to the remaining crowd and the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-address/" target="_blank">audio has been posted here</a>.</p>
<p>Our very talented Office Manager, Leslie Friedman took a lot of great photos. You can see them in a slideshow below. If you spot yourself leave us a comment and say hi!</p>
