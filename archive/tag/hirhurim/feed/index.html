				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Quill_Pen_graphic_for_web_t670.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7003" alt="Quill_Pen_graphic_for_web_t670" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Quill_Pen_graphic_for_web_t670-300x188.jpg" width="300" height="188" /></a>The Yated published its first edition since last week&#8217;s hit job on R&#8217; Gil Student and R&#8217; Harry Maryles. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/04/19/the-difference-between-hirhurim-and-the-yated-a-defense-of-r-gil-student/">The Difference Between Hirhurim and the Yated: A Defense of R’ Gil Student</a>) I am positive that they were barraged with letters to the editor. Some of them were sent to me so I know for certain that they were written.</p>
<p>They published one letter to the editor. It was from R&#8217; Gil Student. That&#8217;s it. His letter was respectful and polite. He also asked for an apology. Then they published a rebuttal from Avrohom Birnbaum who wrote the original article. In his rebuttal Birnbaum demonstrates an incredible ability to be obtuse. He doesn&#8217;t understand why his article was so wrong and doubles down on his unwarranted criticism.</p>
<p>A link to the letters is at the bottom of this post. Don&#8217;t miss the letter from Mrs. Herzog on a completely different topic.</p>
<p>The Yated should have published some more letters supporting R&#8217; Gil and R&#8217; Harry. They did not. So we take to the Internet where we are free to publish whatever we please.</p>
<p>I present a letter to the editor written by <strong>Simcha Schonfeld</strong> who has been published in the letters to the editor section of the Yated several times in the past.</p>
<p><span id="more-7002"></span><br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>An article penned by Avrohom Birnbaum appeared in last week&#8217;s edition that troubled me most deeply. In his piece entitled &#8220;The Broyde Affair and the Media Double Standard&#8221;, Mr. Birnbaum attacked Rabbi Gil Student and his blog Hirhurim for a manufactured series of misdeeds that are more the products of Mr. Birnbaum&#8217;s imagination than they are based in any objective reality. Birnbaum began his attempt at character assassination by accusing Rabbi Student and his website of being &#8220;controversial&#8221; and guilty of &#8220;chareidi smashing&#8221; though in a departure from good and accepted journalistic practices, he offered no evidence to support such incredible accusations. In fact, Rabbi Student is a respected and gentle talmud chacham whose entire essence lacks even a single cell of disrespect for any torah authority, regardless of the hat they wear &#8211; including those who wear black ones, like Rabbi Student himself. He has often taken other bloggers to task for doing exactly what Mr. Birnbaum accused him of. What&#8217;s more, Hihurim (<a href="http://torahmusings.com/">TorahMusings.com</a>) is a <em>chashuv makom torah</em>, an oasis of <em>halacha</em> and <em>machshava</em> on the web that has actually spawned seforim comprised entirely of posts appearing there. One such sefer was given to me as a gift by my (dare I say Chareidi) father. Since Mr. Birnbaum elected to offer no basis for the serious accusations he made, I invite your readers to view the website itself and reach their own conclusions.</p>
<p>I was further puzzled by level of vitriol that Birnbaum used in attacking Rabbi Student for having the perceived gall to decline to answer some of the Yated&#8217;s questions. I do not know who asked the six questions referenced in the piece and am unfamiliar with that individual&#8217;s educational background and journalistic training; however, I could only assume that his/her mentors would have been dissatisfied with the profoundly unprofessional, unnecessarily provocative and outright childish manner in which Rabbi Student was challenged. The questions that Rabbi Student declined to offer comments on included such crass phraseology as accusing Rabbi Student of being a &#8220;mouthpiece&#8221; of &#8220;an outright liar and an ethically tainted individual&#8221; and asked, rhetorically, whether Rabbi Student believed he owed an &#8220;apology&#8221; to his readership. Regardless of what one may think of Michael Broyde, there is a way to communicate in life and there are standards of professionalism in journalism. Those were not adhered to by the author of these intentionally loaded questions that conveyed clear hostility and disrespect more than any earnest desire to know. In response to the Yated&#8217;s adolescent style of questioning, Rabbi Student appropriately took the high road and offered no response at all. Sadly, as Mr. Birnbaum&#8217;s article demonstrates, the high road is all too often the road less traveled.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6971" alt="part 2_1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/part-2_1-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" />In the secular world, the print media is losing to digital media. Newspapers are being replaced by websites and journalists are being replaced with bloggers. Apparently the same thing is happening in the charedi world. The print media is losing to the bloggers.</p>
<p>The Yated Ne&#8217;eman has attacked blogs in the past but this week&#8217;s paper has a full page article attacking two specific blogs, Hirhurim and Emes V&#8217;Emunah.</p>
<p>In their article, Avraham Birnbaum manages to write a couple thousand words without saying anything of substance.</p>
<p>The entire premise of the article hinges on the presumption that the Hirhurim community and R&#8217; Gil Student use his blog to attack charedim on a regular basis. Birnbaum portrays Hirhurim as a <em>moshav leitzim</em> of constant charedi bashing.<span id="more-6970"></span></p>
<p>The reader has no way of knowing if this true or not seeing as Birnbaum does not cite a single example or offer a shred of proof for his salacious claims. It&#8217;s one thing to criticize a blog, it&#8217;s another to criticize a blog for something without any support. I went back and did some research. I looked at several weeks of blog posts on Hirhurim. It&#8217;s not so much that Hirhurim bashes charedim, it&#8217;s more like Hirhurim completely ignores charedim. I know that it does not feel especially good to be ignored,  but being ignored is hardly akin to bashing.</p>
<p>In fact, in my experience, there is no blog that promotes respectful discourse more than Hirhurim. The posts are scholarly, thoughtful, substantive, and respectful. If there was a blog that should be acceptable to charedim, it should be Hirhurim!</p>
<p>The Yated reached out to R&#8217; Gil for comment. R&#8217; Gil politely declined to answer the six questions they asked him in an email. The only other experience R&#8217; Gil has had with the Yated has been negative. It serves R&#8217; Gil no purpose to provide soundbites to the Yated. Further, R&#8217; Gil and R&#8217; Michael Broyde are friends. There is no reason for R&#8217; Gil to incriminate his friend in the pages of the Yated.</p>
<p>But the Yated is a scorned mistress. Birnbaum presents R&#8217; Gil&#8217;s polite &#8220;no comment&#8221; as a severe crime. His argument is the classic fallacious argument of  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10101483653832655" target="_blank">what I call the worst argument ever</a>: <em>&#8220;You are doing A in response to B. I think if it was X you would do Y. WHY ARE YOU NOT DOING Y?&#8221;</em> Birnbaum posits that if a charedi leader was involved in a scandal like R&#8217; Broyde&#8217;s R&#8217; Gil would be savoring every moment of it. But here R&#8217; Gil is silent. This is somehow unacceptable.</p>
<p>The Yated expects a response from R&#8217; Gil because of several assumptions. Then they turn a &#8220;no comment&#8221; into a terrible crime. As if anyone who reads the Yated read Orwell, Birnbaum invokes &#8220;a<em>ll animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal</em>&#8220;. Invoking Orwell because R&#8217; Gil said &#8220;no comment&#8221;?  This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Birnbaum claims that the Jewish Week and the Forward were hardly able to contain their glee in their reporting of the scandal. I didn&#8217;t notice that at all. But I might reconsider my position if there was a shred of evidence in the article to support this claim. None is provided.</p>
<p>I do submit that Birnbaum&#8217;s characterization of Emes V&#8217;Emunah is less strident and more accurate. Perhaps he just has an axe to grind with Hirhurim, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Birnbaum is incredibly preachy and condescending. But that wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if his article was rooted in fact. Unfortunately it is not. He just sounds like a child who didn&#8217;t get what he wanted so he stomps his feet loudly in the hope that someone will listen.</p>
<p>To me, this article represents everything wrong with lazy orthodox Judaism. The reader is expected to rely on the writer without evidence. The reader will likely take Birnbaum&#8217;s word for everything he says simply because he is published in the Yated and R&#8217; Gil is published on an unholy blog. I doubt any of the Yated readers will check Hirhurim for themselves to see if the levied criticisms are accurate. At the very least, Birnbaum could have suggested readers do their own investigation and come to their own conclusion.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the way of the Yated or its readers. It is the paper for people who want other people to do their thinking for them. The Yated culture does not encourage critical thinking or challenging the status quo. Hirhurim does. That is the real story here. Aside from the print media vs. the digital media war, there is a more fundamental battle taking place here. Hirhurim represents critical thinking and the Yated represents blind faith in authority. One Hirhurim post has more footnotes than every edition of the Yated ever printed. Hirhurim invites open discussion. The Yated only prints things that are absolutely consistent with their ideology. That&#8217;s the real issue here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll close with three points in summary:</p>
<p>1) The Yated should be ashamed of this article for its complete mischaracterization of Hirhurim without evidence.<br />
2) R&#8217; Gil has no obligation to talk to the Yated, especially about a friend.<br />
3) The Yated and Hirhurim operate as polar opposites with regard to independent research vs. appeal to authority.</p>

<p><em>Full disclosure: My esteemed father writes a weekly dvar Torah column for the Yated and is the voice of reason (obviously) on their Chinuch Roundtable.</em></p>

<p>Please read both and if you are able to help in any way possible, it is much appreciated.</p>
<p>One great thing about blogging is the opportunity to connect with other people for the sake of an important cause. Today, I present you with two important causes.<span id="more-1120"></span></p>
<p>First, there is a blogger who writes vitriolic, hate laced blog posts against anyone with whom he disagrees. He does so under the guise of Authentic Judaism. He makes no real arguments, just yells loudly at those he views as a threat (read: anyone who thinks differently than he). Apparently, he thinks that God spoke to him directly and gave him Torah and nobody else. A number of bloggers are trying to snatch the Google search result ranking from his blog.</p>
<p>I am here to help.</p>
<p>More importantly, DovBear is looking for some kind souls to help a family in desperate financial need. The economic downturn has claimed some more victims and from what I understand, their situation is dire. It is really easy to help, <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Just click here and click donate in the upper right hand sidebar</a> and donate just a little money. Type in the amount you can give and indicate it is for <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23familyneedsdough" target="_blank">#famliyneedsdough</a>. If you can give just a few dollars it would make a tremendous difference to this family. Every penny donated will be given directly to the needy family.</p>
<p>I appreciate any relief you can provide.</p>
