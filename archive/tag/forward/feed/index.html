				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/world/middleeast/plan-to-resolve-western-wall-prayer-controversy.html?_r=1&amp;"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6923" alt="ISRAEL-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ISRAEL-articleLarge-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>All hail Natan Sharansky, peacemaker. We hope.</p>
<p>The world has become witnesses to a very public and somewhat embarrassing battle over the Kotel. Although instead of the familiar disagreements between Palestinians and Israelis, this scuffle pitted Jew against Jew.</p>
<p>The Kotel is maintained by orthodox Jews who would like to preserve an atmosphere that is similar to orthodox synagogues and everything that entails. Many find attempts by women to lead small prayer services offensive. The women prayer services are often led by Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall. Hoffman has been arrested several times for leading such services and for the severe offense of wearing a particular kind of tallit.</p>
<p>The conflict was escalating and becoming more and more ugly with each passing arrest. More orthodox Jews cast aspersion toward Hoffman and more liberal minding Jews stood behind her.</p>
<p>The Forward first reported a breakthrough in negotiations headed by Natan Sharansky. The NY Times spoke with Sharansky and describes the plan:<span id="more-6922"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mr. Sharansky’s proposal involves expanding and improving the areas accessible for prayer at the wall to include the southern section known as Robinson’s Arch which, under his plan, would be open for Jews wishing to pray in a less Orthodox, more egalitarian style 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The main prayer section, which is now divided into men’s and women’s sections, would remain the domain of more traditional worshippers.</p>
<p>Sounds good to me!</p>
<p>Sharansky has close to ties to my family and my shul. My great uncle was responsible for his release from Soviet prison (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Greenwald#Natan_Sharansky" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) and Sharansky&#8217;s daughter married a young man who grew up in my shul. His father, <strong>Alan Danziger</strong>, is the president of Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>Alan told me that Sharansky was charged with coming up with a solution and he (jokingly) asked my advice. I suggested a three section Kotel (men, women, egalitarian) with each group getting use of the best area in the northenmost corner of the Kotel once in a while. I also thought it wise to have non-orthodox Jews participate in the administration of the Kotel.</p>
<p>So I am very pleased with the proposal. It&#8217;s not exactly what I suggested, but close enough. I really hope all parties will agree. The NY Times reports that Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall are not completely satisfied with the plan <em>&#8220;but we will compromise. You don’t always have to be right, you have to be smart, and compromise is a sign of maturity and understanding what’s at stake here.”</em></p>
<p>Compromise is good. Let&#8217;s hope everyone will be willing to accept this proposal.</p>
<p>Some have argued that people who are not comfortable with the current orthodox arrangements at the Kotel are few in number and they are too few to matter. I think this is ludicrous. Perhaps if more people were made to feel comfortable at our Holiest place, more people who are not orthodox sympathetic would come to the Kotel to pray and be inspired.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that is a good result.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6795" alt="soapbox" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/soapbox-285x300.jpg" width="285" height="300" /><em>Pardon me, as I step up onto my soapbox.</em></p>
<p>On Friday, I defended R&#8217; Hershel Schachter. It was an extremely odd experience. The reason it was so odd was because I actually did not agree with R&#8217; Schachter. You&#8217;ll not see one word of agreement in my post on Friday.</p>
<p>What you will see is an attack on the Forward. What the Forward did was wrong, sensationalist, and terrible reporting.</p>
<p>Their lede was offensive and their lack of nuance was deplorable. I sought to set the record straight on what R&#8217; Schachter said and what he actually stands for. I wanted to explain exactly what R&#8217; Schachter meant and help people to see that what the Forward said was not accurate.</p>
<p>Some people disagree with me that R&#8217; Schachter actually did not mean what I say he meant. That is, almost every case should be reported to the authorities except in a very small number of unclear situations. That&#8217;s okay. I am 99% positive that if you would ask him if I representing his opinion correctly he would say yes.</p>
<p>Other people were livid that I was &#8220;supporting&#8221;  R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s opinion on the halachic obligations as they relate to abuse. Those people are angry that I dared to lend credence to  R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s position that there should be some sort of gatekeeper between the authorities and the abuse victim.</p>
<p>The thing is, I didn&#8217;t do that.<span id="more-6794"></span> What I did was show, to the best of my knowledge, how what R&#8217; Schachter said, or at least meant, was not what was being reported in the Forward. If the Forward had reported what was actually said, first of all it would have not been such a big deal, but more importantly, it would not have been as interesting.</p>
<p>The real story was R&#8217; Schachter dismisses mesira as a reason not to report and unless there is serious doubt about the veracity of a claim one should go to the authorities. This is the most progressive position I have heard in a public statement from any Rosh Yeshiva on abuse.</p>
<p>However, for my liking, <strong>it does not go far enough.</strong> I know a lot of people only came to this blog because of this story. But <strong>my position on abuse</strong> was already outlined in a previous post: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/10/weberman-is-found-guilty-what-it-means/">Weberman is Found Guilty: What It Means</a>. Here is what I said there,  in case you have trouble following a link &#8211; but you should read the rest of the post too.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In order for our community to handle abuse properly, three things need to happen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1) We need to discard the concept of <em>mesirah. </em>The word needs to be excised from our lexicon and it must be relegated to an anachronism and relic of the past. If you need three poskim to explain why there is no prohibition of <em>mesira </em>in sex abuse cases read this: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/">Mesira (The Jewish Informant) in Halacha</a>. People who cover up abuse are thousands of times worse than any <em>moser. </em>Stop covering up and making excuses. We cannot stand for this in our communities.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2) We need to understand the horrible effects of abuse. We don’t get it. We never really will get it. But we need to know that it is much worse than we could possibly imagine. Here are just some symptoms of abuse (that do not apply equally to all survivors). Abuse victims contemplate suicide. They don’t trust anyone. They hate Jews. They hate God. They cannot be intimate. They are scared to commit to relationships or jobs. They seek escape via substance abuse. They cry every day. They become numb and cannot feel anything. They isolate themselves. They never grow up. They need to spend thousands of dollars on therapy and are never really cured. As much as the abuse hurts, the apathy from the frum community hurts even more. Which brings me to number 3.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3) We need to accept survivors into our community with love and affection. We cannot judge them. We cannot allow them to feel second class. We cannot protect their abusers. We must tell them that we do not accept the monsters that harmed them into our communities. We cannot choose monsters over innocent victims. But here is the hard part. We need to acknowledge their pain and suffering without making them feel like they are damaged goods. Yes, their lives have been severely affected for the worse. But they can live beautiful, meaningful lives. We just need to let them. We cannot screen abuse victims from <em>shidduchim</em> and we cannot excuse bad behavior because one is a victim. Yes, they are going to have a hard time because of everything that we still need to understand about the harms of abuse. But that’s okay. We need them to know that we don’t mind if they have a few issues here and there. Who doesn’t? They cannot be stigmatized, otherwise they will never come forward and we run the risk of losing another generation of sex abuse victims.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Let us hope and pray that Weberman was correctly found guilty and more importantly, let us hope and pray that this case is a tipping point. Let us hope and pray that this case is the wake-up call we needed. Let us hope and pray that there are no more <em>korbanos </em>to the Gods of <em>shem tov </em>and <em>chillul Hashem. </em>Those are noble pursuits, but not at the expense of our children.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Ad kan</em>. Enough is enough.</p>
<p><strong>To be clear</strong>, my <em>posek </em>has no qualms about reporting all cases of abuse and that is who I follow. No gatekeepers, no investigations, no interrogations, none of that. Get rid of all of it. R&#8217; Schachter should have said. It&#8217;s almost what he said, but he didn&#8217;t go far enough. I do <strong>not agree with R&#8217; Schachter. </strong>But I don&#8217;t think the Forward was justified in their attack on R&#8217; Schachter either. Not to mention, I don&#8217;t appreciate all the people out there who hate me now because they think I agree with R&#8217; Schachter. I don&#8217;t. So don&#8217;t hate me. Thanks.</p>
<p>Also, I do not condone racial speech. Never. It was not acceptable. I don&#8217;t excuse it. I merely provided some context and a character opinion.</p>
<p><em>And do me a favor, share this post so that all the people who thought I said that I support R&#8217; Schachter can have the record set straight.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6787" alt="IMG_3104" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/IMG_3104-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" />R&#8217; Hershel Schachter whom I admire greatly, is in a bit of hot water. The Forward published an article that is misleading and inflammatory about R&#8217; Schachter.</p>
<p>The lede is particularly egregious: <em>&#8220;A top rabbinic dean of Yeshiva University has warned rabbis about the dangers of reporting child sex abuse allegations to the police because it could result in a Jew being jailed with a black inmate, or as he put it, “a schvartze,” who might want to kill him.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Sounds pretty bad, huh? Well once you actually read the article you see that it&#8217;s not quite so simple.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go in reverse order.<span id="more-6786"></span> R&#8217; Schachter is not a racist. This is a certainty. He doesn&#8217;t have a negative bone in his body. He is one of the nicest, sweetest people I have ever met. He also speaks in yiddish a lot. When he says the &#8220;S&#8221; word, he does not mean it in a negative sense. He means it as the yiddish word for black person. There may be a little of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/03/11/r-manis-friedman-and-dov-hikind-explained/" target="_blank"><em>this</em></a> here as well. Sure, it sounds bad when he adds &#8220;who wants to kill him&#8221; but in all likelihood he was simply using an example, a poor example, of someone who would be in harm&#8217;s way if they went to jail. <em>(Edit: It&#8217;s pretty clear he was referring to the Nation of Islam as a potentially dangerous cell mate.)</em> More on that later.</p>
<p>A for the abuse and the reporting of abuse, the Forward totally hides the ball. For all his genius and piety, R&#8217; Schachter is a genuinely committed halachic Jew. He does everything in accordance with halacha and his approach is to show how halacha would handle any potential situation.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter is among the most liberal halachic authorities when it comes to reporting abuse or any other crime to the secular authorities. I was in the room when I heard him say that there is no prohibition of mesira today. (For more on mesira see this: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/">Mesira in Halacha</a>.) This is a huge statement. One that the Forward should be championing. The primary obstacle to reporting abuse has classically been a misguided reliance on mesira. R&#8217; Schachter says there is no mesira. That&#8217;s huge. Pop the champagne.</p>
<p>However, in R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s opinion, one can&#8217;t go to the authorities unless one has something to report. Unless a victim can state facts with a fair amount of certainty, there is nothing to report. So if a victim comes forward and says &#8220;So and so abused me,&#8221; and there is reason to believe the victim, I am under the impression that R&#8217; Schachter holds that one is obligated to go to the authorities.</p>
<p>But the Forward doesn&#8217;t learn in a yeshiva. So the Forward doesn&#8217;t know that most of what we focus on in yeshiva are the non-obvious cases, the close calls, the cases that cut two ways or more. So R&#8217; Schachter spends considerable time on the borderline cases. He explains that when the veracity or factual basis of the claim is unclear you need to bring in professionals to assess the situation. That&#8217;s also the right idea! But it&#8217;s only in a small number of cases. Most cases are more clear cut. But in our Talmudic fashion, these abnormal cases become the focus of the discussion.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter sprinkles in an anecdote too. In the anecdote he is harsh to a possible victim. He advises the victim to go to a professional because he doesn&#8217;t have enough information to go to the authorities. The victim does not go. R&#8217; Schachter says that the victim is playing with fire. This is because more than anyone else, R&#8217; Schachter understands the gravity of allowing an abuser to run free.</p>
<p>So it is easy for the uninitiated to focus on this part of the conversation. The non-automatic cases. But that is a mistake. The primary points were already established: No mesira, if a victim comes forward go to the authorities. Sure, there are grey area cases and in those cases, one should try to figure out how to proceed using the best available professionals. This is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Schachter also wants to show the gravity of a false accusation simply to show that halacha is concerned for everyone. The victim, the abuser, the falsely accused. All of them can be dealt with in the framework of halacha. Going to the authorities is very serious business. Halachically, we take responsibilty for what happens after we report abuse. We need to be careful and if we are careful, we must go to the authorities.</p>
<p>In my opinion, R&#8217; Schachter is one of our greatest authorities on this issue should be praised by the Forward, not maligned.</p>
<p><em>If you can&#8217;t see the difference between R&#8217; Schachter&#8217;s situation and R&#8217; Manis Friedman&#8217;s and you need help, I am happy to assist you. But they have nothing to do with each other. Don&#8217;t even try to compare them.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6777" alt="Choices" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Choices-300x239.jpeg" width="300" height="239" />The Forward deserves a lot of credit for publishing a <a href="http://forward.com/articles/172778/a-mother-is-who-i-am/?p=all" target="_blank">very nice article written by Rachel Freier</a> about the joys of Hasidic motherhood. Unlike Judy Brown, Freier is still part of the Hasidic community and she argues that being a <em>yiddishe momme</em><em> </em>is who she is. It defines her. She argues that the pressure and value placed on having children in the Hasidic community is vital and a beautiful part of her lifestyle. It is what makes her life worth living.</p>
<p>Freier is an attorney. I don&#8217;t know for sure, but I think she might be the only Hasidic woman who is a lawyer <em>(NOT INCLUDING LUBAVITCH).</em> As an orthodox Jew, I am very proud of women like Rachel Freier. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/" target="_blank">With all the talk of whether women can &#8220;have it all&#8221;</a>, she is a example of someone who does have it all. She has a family &#8211; 6 kids. She has a career &#8211; a law practice. She has religion &#8211; Hasidic Judaism. She has it all. As a role model, I think she is an excellent person for orthodox Jewish women to emulate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also inspiring to see someone who has it all, coming back to their role as a parent, and in her case as a mother as the thing she values most and as the part of her life that defines her. I cannot say it with any more conviction &#8211; More Rachel Freiers please!</p>
<p>But, and you just had to know there was a &#8220;but&#8221; coming, I don&#8217;t entirely agree with her approach.<span id="more-6776"></span></p>
<p>I think Freier makes a mistake that a lot of women with traditional values make. They think that feminism or modern gender roles seeks to eliminate the traditional homemaker or <em>yiddishe momme</em> from society. Therefore, they will argue that there is a lot of value and beauty in traditional roles where women are mostly mothers and wives.</p>
<p>But that argument is not a counter argument to feminism. It is not a counter argument to the Deborah Feldmans and Judy Browns of the world. All they are arguing is that women should have a <em>choice</em>. If a young woman wants to marry after a couple dates, great. If a woman want to have children right away, great. If a woman wants to have a large family, great. But what if they don&#8217;t? Should they be pressured? Should they be forced? Should they feel like they must do what they don&#8217;t want to do?</p>
<p>Brown, Feldman, feminists, etc. want women to have choices. Freier is happy with her life. That&#8217;s great. Really. I hope many women can follow in her footsteps. I am happy for her and for the thousands and thousands of women who chose motherhood, or even if they merely accepted motherhood, but did so with exuberance and gusto. But there are too many women (and men too) who would like to have options.</p>
<p>By limiting options, traditionalists are implying that with a choice, too many would opt out. That doesn&#8217;t make for a very compelling case to opt in. So what I suggest strong, successful, more traditional women in the Hasidic and non-Hasidic communities do, is join the voice of the progressives who want women to have that choice and then and only then make their case for traditionalism. Don&#8217;t make the case for traditionalism and hope to head off anyone from rejecting it. Give our daughters every option available to them and guide them, teach them what values you think are important. If they buy in, great. If not, they will be productive, happy, contributing members of society in other ways. They may have but a few children instead of half a dozen or more. Or they may postpone motherhood for a few years. Let them. Please.</p>
<p>Rachel Freier had options. She is a lawyer. Clearly, she has excellent command of the English language. But far too many of the young women in her community are deprived of the tools that would enable them to have a choice and they march in lockstep to a sit in date at 17, the bridal canopy at 18, and the maternity ward at 19, and at 21, and at 23, and so on.</p>
<p>I know that Freier does not appreciate this point because of her law school anecdote. She took a brave stance in her law school classroom discussion on abortion and argued that abortion should not be legal because <em>&#8220;having children is a blessing and each day that I gave birth was the most memorable day of my life. The joy of motherhood cannot be properly described in a law school casebook.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great argument in favor of someone <em>electing</em> not to abort a pregnancy. It is <em>not</em> a valid argument against giving women a choice about aborting a pregnancy. I am not arguing that abortion is good, bad, or otherwise. There are perhaps very good arguments to ban abortion. The joy of motherhood is not a valid argument when the potential mother does not want that joy or maybe she doesn&#8217;t even feel it. This anecdote shows that Freier misses the point on the choice to have an abortion and on the march to motherhood. Women should have choices, so long as they are moral and justifiable in one&#8217;s legal and ethical code. There is nothing in halachic Judaism that should prevent a young woman from having a choice.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget, that there are many women in the Hasidic community who would never let their daughters attend law school. Would Ms. Freier not argue that even Hasidic women should have that option?</p>
<p>We love our <em>yiddishe mommes. </em>They play a very important role in the future of our people. We want our <i>yiddishe mommes</i> to want to be <em>yiddishe mommes</em> and embrace that role. But it&#8217;s only one role. It need not be the only role.</p>

<p>By now you&#8217;ve probably heard that Anat Hoffman was arrested at the Western Wall last week. You may have read her personal account that describes a harrowing encounter with law enforcement. I don&#8217;t know if her claims are true or exaggerated, but her claims are irrelevant. Nor does it matter what sensationalist headlines have been penned.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post we will focus exclusively on facts and then my opinion based on those facts. Here are the facts:</p>
<p>Women of the Wall is an organization whose &#8220;mission is to achieve the social and legal recognition of our right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray, and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those facts are undisputed. They are agitators. They are trying to change the status quo. They are activists.<span id="more-6360"></span></p>
<p>Anat Hoffman is their leader and her mission is to agitate, change the status quo. She is the chief activist.</p>
<p>The Women of the Wall write on their website that the law at the Western Wall is that no religious ceremony may be performed in the Women&#8217;s section of the Western Wall plaza. Although this is not a primary source, and I cannot find the primary source (feel free to fill me in), we will consider this a fact as well. The law has been interpreted to ban women from blowing a shofar or wearing a prayer shawl and from reading the Torah out loud.</p>
<p>Anat Hoffman leads a women&#8217;s prayer group at the Western Wall from time to time. She wears a prayer shawl and reads from the Torah. On several occasions Ms. Hoffman has been asked or demanded to cease these illegal activities. She does not acquiesce. She gets arrested.</p>
<p>This has happened several times. Each time it happens the media gets excited about it, Women of the Wall gets publicity, and&#8230; nothing changes.</p>
<p>Supporters of WOW find the law offensive and the subsequent arrests and treatment subversive.</p>
<p>Traditionalists consider Hoffman a disingenuous troublemaker who deserves what she gets.</p>
<p>Here is where the facts end and my opinion begins.</p>
<p>The law prohibiting women from religious ceremony at the Western Wall is a law that is written by orthodox rabbis to preserve the sanctity of their holiest place.They honestly believe that a woman who blows a shofar, or wears a prayer shawl, or reads from the Torah is an affront to God and the Holiness of the Western Wall. My question for them is why?</p>
<p>There is no prohibition against a woman doing any of these mitzvos. In fact, R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein writes that women are welcome to do these mitzvahs. There is nothing wrong with a woman reading from a Torah scroll for other women. Nothing at all. To be clear, the law is prohibiting actions that are permissible according to halacha. I find this hard to stomach.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s grant the rabbis of the Western Wall the power to legislate the decorum of the Western Wall. While this may be offensive to non-orthodox Jews, I can also understand why they have control over the Wall. But the rabbis of the Wall are only granted the right to legislate the Wall in accordance with Jewish law! So it is reasonable that they would prohibit men and women from praying together. It is also reasonable that they would mandate reasonably modest dress at the Wall. But it is not reasonable to enforce a rule that prevents people from performing mitzvahs that they are granted permission to perform!</p>
<p>It is hard to condone the law as it currently stands.</p>
<p>Some people have a hard time giving credence to an agitator like Anat Hoffman. While it may be challenging for Traditionalists to support her cause, the broader message of her cause is universal. All people should be granted the right to serve God at the Western Wall so long as it does not violate halacha. It seems hard to oppose that kind of rule.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really feel bad for Ms. Hoffman. She knows what is coming to her when she agitates the establishment. But just because she knows what is coming to her, that does not mean that her battle is not my battle. I empathize with Ms. Hoffman and I support her right to worship God at her holiest of places so long as she conforms to halacha. She has. Getting arrested for following halacha and doing a mitzvah at the Western Wall should not be the norm. This is a form of religious persecution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only the more liberal branches of Judaism have publically supported Ms. Hoffman.</p>
<p>This is the least effective way to change the established rules. Hopefully, the powers that be at the Western Wall will see the beauty and value in allowing women to pray in accordance with halacha even if it is not in accordance with their personal preferences and standards.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/synagogue_during_tora_reading_better_picture.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6308" title="synagogue" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/synagogue_during_tora_reading_better_picture-300x154.png" alt="" width="300" height="154" /></a>I read in the Forward that 1 million American Jews seek identity outside Shul. The purpose of this statistic is a bit lost on me. Sure, many Jews identify as Jewish through their attendance at synagogue. It&#8217;s just that I haven&#8217;t really met anyone like that. Most Jews I meet, whether they are secular, charedi, or somewhere in between consider their Shul as a part of their Jewish identity but I certainly don&#8217;t get the sense that Jewish Americans get their Jewish identity from shul.</p>
<p>But just for fun, let&#8217;s assume the study is a bombshell discovery that very profoundly alters the entire vision of American Judaism. We will assume that the point of the survey was to show that for many American Jews, the synagogue model is not working. As the article in the Forward concludes, quoting Medalon Braun of the Workmen&#8217;s Circle, there is <em>“a real need for a Jewish home for those who do not seek a congregational affiliation.”</em></p>
<p>It seems to me that there are three take-away points that one could make upon reading this discovery and one action item.<span id="more-6307"></span></p>
<p>1) Some people actually <em>do </em>get their Jewish identity from their shuls.</p>
<p>2) The assumption is that if one does not get their Jewish identity inside a synagogue their Jewish identity is in danger of being lost.</p>
<p>3) The people who don&#8217;t go to shul often cannot be categorized as endangered Jews as they are seeking Jewish identity, albeit outside the synagogue.</p>
<p>The action item is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>It seems that there are tons of Jews who want to affiliate Jewishly outside the synagogue. But in my assessment there is a very limited number of such opportunities, especially in a group setting. But institutionalizing these opportunities runs the risk of transferring the shul experience to experiences outside of shul. It is likely that part of the reason these people are looking outside the synagogue is because they are not the type of people who love institutionalized Judaism. Thus, creating institutionalized Judaism outside the shul is probably not going to help.</p>
<p>So what are we to do? How do we appeal to American Jews who specifically do not want to identify with institutionalized Judaism?</p>
<p>Judaism <em>is </em>institutional. On one foot, the best I can think of is Torah study. One can study Torah completely independently. One can study whatever one wants. One can publish their Torah thoughts on their own. In short, Torah study has always been a hallmark of Jewish identity and has served as a counterweight to the institutionalization of shul life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this won&#8217;t appeal to everyone. Some people don&#8217;t enjoy studying and learning. However, it has been my experience that when taught properly, anyone can enjoy Torah study. It is possible that non-orthodox Jews think that Torah study is for rabbis and orthodox Jews. But I disagree. It&#8217;s for everyone.</p>
<p>So maybe we don&#8217;t need a new solution. Perhaps the answer is right under our Jewish noses. We are the people of the book. Are we not?</p>
<p>Now accepting additional suggestions&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/image.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5430" title="charles hynes" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/image.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="255" /></a>The Forward is fuming at the Brooklyn district attorney for not releasing names of sex abuse suspects in the orthodox Jewish community. The Freedom of Information Act is supposed to give citizens access to government documents and information including the names of individuals arrested for sex abuse.</p>
<p>The DA explained to the Forward that these names are different than other names because they are all of the names requested are part of Hasidic groups and have allegedly abused Hasidic victims. Therefore there is a significant danger that the names of the victims would be discovered.</p>
<p>The Forward then cites several legal scholars who feel that this is an abuse of discretion by the DA. The reactions to this story have been equally heavy-handed. Some going as far as saying that DA Hynes is bought and paid for by the Hasidic community.<span id="more-5428"></span></p>
<p>In legal terms the decision might be wrong. But I don&#8217;t think the anger over this decision should be directed at Hynes and the DA&#8217;s office. I think they are acted reasonably under the circumstances. I really do.</p>
<p>In the Hasidic community, the understanding sex abuse is only its infant stages. Their reaction to abuse is pretty medieval. It&#8217;s hardly as if their is a firm grasp of the harms caused by abuse nor the proper approach to dealing with abuse. This is the reality. There is no way around it.</p>
<p>What would happen if the names were released and the victims names were discovered? It&#8217;s not far-fetched to assume that the victims would be outed. Once the names are outed you can be sure they would be called liars, <em>mosrim</em>, attention-seekers, and other names. It&#8217;s entirely possibly that some &#8220;well-meaning&#8221; vigilantes would take matters into their own hands and silence the victims with threats or violence.</p>
<p>The DA is correct in not releasing the names. But don&#8217;t blame him. Blame the community that would prefer to silence victims and reward its abusive members than do the right thing and weed out this horrible plague from its midst.</p>
<p>I am positive that if the community would deal with abuse like any other normal community the DA would feel comfortable releasing the names of the alleged abusers. But as it stands now, he cannot risk the health or even lives of the victims. I agree with this decision.</p>
<p>This does not give the DA a pass for not prosecuting cases from the community that should be prosecuted. But I think it goes to show just how difficult such prosecutions would be without the cooperation of witnesses and victims. The problem here is not the DA. In fact he understands the community better than his critics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a cover up at all. It&#8217;s protection.</p>
<p>Fix the community and justice will follow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/newt-2012.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4903" title="newt-2012" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/newt-2012-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>GOP Candidate and Presidential hopeful, Newt Gingrich has made headlines with his recent claim that the Palestinians are an Invented People. The responses from across the idealogical and political spectrum have been as wild and varied as to be expected.</p>
<p>On one extreme, representatives of the Palestinians fired back at Gingrich. In a statement, they called Gingrich racist and said that his was the worst kind of insult that would only help the cycle of violence. On the other extreme are those nodding their heads in agreement at the prospect of a President who agrees with their perspective on the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the fact-checkers have confirmed and debunked Gingrich&#8217;s claim. There is evidence that the Palestinians existed as a small subgroup in the land that is currently Israel. However, there is little evidence that they had any sense of national pride or unity as a group before the State of Israel was established.</p>
<p>What strikes me is how silly this whole thing is.<span id="more-4902"></span> Gingrich&#8217;s comment could be equally said about a myriad of nations and peoples. It could really be said about anybody! What qualifies a nation as a &#8220;non-invented&#8221; people? How long do those people need to be where they are to be considered legitimate?</p>
<p>Is the United States of America not invented? Is the United Kingdom not Invented? Is Mexico not invented? Even historically ethnic countries such as Japan or Sweden are practically speaking &#8220;invented&#8221;. They lived in close proximity for a long time and eventually created a sense of national pride and unity. But they were not magically granted the land in which they live by some objective method of determining land division. Clearly land is not given only to nations who are not invented.</p>
<p>Further, let&#8217;s assume for a second that Gingrich is correct. The Palestinians are invented and invented people don&#8217;t get land. Now what? What are you going to do about it? Nuke the West Bank? Manufacture a tsunami and drown Gaza? There are millions of these so-called invented people. What now? Point being, invented or not, there is an issue that needs to be dealt with. By simply saying they are invented does nothing to resolve that issue. In fact, it probably has the opposite effect. It entrenches both sides and polarizes the parties.</p>
<p>And what about Gingrich himself? He is a Catholic. Is that an invented religion? If it is not, well that means that all other religions are invented. So are they all not granted the right to exist simply because they are invented? Everything is invented. Mazel tov.</p>
<p>Which brings us full circle. Gingrich said that Palestinians are an invented people simply to anger some people and excite others. It was a political statement that carries less meaning than most political statements. It is the kind of broad brushed, meaningless statement for which politics is famous.</p>
<p>I think the voting public would prefer to hear about solutions to a decades long conflict instead of whimsical platitudes. I wonder if Gingrich has any ideas for the conflict or if he can&#8217;t be bothered to deal with invented people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/tzedek_l1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3487" title="tzedek_l" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/tzedek_l1.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="247" /></a>The Forward is reporting that a new certification agency is set to begin certifying kosher food with an additional symbol called a Magen Tzedek denoting that the certified food meets their ethical standard. The guidelines for earning a Magen Tzedek require food companies to meet the Magen Tzedek standard in 5 major categories: labor, animal welfare, consumer issues, corporate integrity and environmental impact. The standards are extensive. They fill a 150 slide PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this innovation and have mixed feelings about it.</p>
<p>My first thought is that certifying businesses as ethical is a nice thing to do.<span id="more-3485"></span> There are people who would only support a business if they were confident that the business was acting legally and ethically in all of its facets. Having that information verified by a third party seems like a great idea.</p>
<p>My second thought is that the standards are completely arbitrary. There are 5 categories and they are all issues and I think they  are all important. But why are these the 5 issues the certification cares about? Moreover, not only are the 5 issues arbitrary, but the standard by which they are judged must be completely arbitrary as well. Take &#8220;environmental impact&#8221;. How much environmental impact is acceptable? Based on what is that standard established? Take &#8220;corporate integrity&#8221;. Does that include secretaries who nick paper clips and pens? What if the CEO makes a disproportionate amount of money? Where are the standards coming from?</p>
<p>In contrast, kosher certification is based on rabbinic sources. The sources are all agreed upon. There are minor discrepancies in application, but the standards are, for lack of a better word, standardized.</p>
<p>I am wary of any standard that is not standardized. I could be wrong. But I don&#8217;t see how things that are by definition arbitrary can be useful tools in a certification program.</p>
<p>Personally, I think a &#8220;whistle-blowing&#8221; organization would be more useful. Find out the facts. Report the facts. Then allow the consumer to decide whether the information is something that would affect their decision. This avoids the arbitrariness of the standards but still achieves the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>My third thought is that the reaction of the orthodox Jewish media is heinous. For example the headline on Matzav.com read: <a title="Permanent Link to Left-Wing Non-Torah Liberal Jewish Factions to Test New Magen Tzedek Kashrus “Ethics Seal” in Kosher Marketplace" rel="bookmark" href="http://matzav.com/left-wing-non-torah-liberal-jewish-factions-to-test-new-magen-tzedek-kashrus-ethics-seal-in-kosher-marketplace">Left-Wing Non-Torah Liberal Jewish Factions to Test New Magen Tzedek Kashrus “Ethics Seal” in Kosher Marketplace</a>. As I sarcastically posted on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/e_fink/status/15444439279341568" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, this headline is slightly biased.</p>
<p>Why should it matter to an orthodox Jew if a good idea comes from Left-Wingers? Or even if it&#8217;s Non-Torah? Plenty of really great ideas are Non-Torah. And people who demand ethical business practices are to be considered &#8220;Liberal Jewish Factions&#8221;? Why? Further, the standards may be arbitrary, but they are also based mostly on Torah principles!</p>
<p>But what bothered me most of all is that lately, orthodox Jews are drawn to all sorts of stringencies that make them feel better about their observance of Torah. So why would it be offensive to them to add this stringency? Isn&#8217;t it reasonable to be strict about treatment of employees? Proper treatment of animals is required by the Torah! If corporate integrity means &#8220;honesty in business&#8221; well that is also a Torah requirement! Not wasting the earth&#8217;s resources? That&#8217;s also in the Torah. (See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/22/earth-day/" target="_blank">Earth Day</a>.)</p>
<p>So why the uproar?</p>
<p>I am very interested to see how this certification progresses and if it begins to certify products in the orthodox Jewish marketplace. I hope that I will be able to post a follow up after this certification hits the market place and begins to make an impact (or fades away).</p>
