				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/life-preserver.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7244" alt="life-preserver" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/life-preserver-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>I don’t think it matters much what Jewish law would say about the government snooping on its citizens. The government is not subject to Jewish law and its citizens don’t expect the government to conform its policies to Jewish law. Yet, there seems to be value in such analysis as I have been asked this question by several people.</p>
<p>As is often the case, we have two competing interests at stake. Privacy on one hand and safety on the other. Both of these interests are recognized in Jewish law. But they are completely different planes.</p>
<p>Life is primary in Jewish law. All else comes after life. One is not permitted to kill. One is not permitted to commit suicide. One is not permitted to harm one self. One is not permitted to place one’s life in danger. One is obligated to violate Jewish law in order to save one’s own life (with three exceptions &#8211; murder, idolatry, and adultery). The sanctity of life is of the utmost importance in Jewish law. These particular laws are derived from primary sources in the Torah and Mishna.<span id="more-7243"></span></p>
<p>There is also a prohibition against snooping on one’s neighbor in Jewish law. One is not permitted to place a window overlooking one’s neighbor’s private property. This sort of loss of privacy gives rise to a civil action in Jewish court. Some authorties extend right of privacy to include eavesdropping or even accidentally hearing others in private conversation.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is standing prohibtion in Jewish law against sharing anything revealed in private conversation. Without specifically stating that a conversation is allowed to be shared, it is required to be kept in confidence.</p>
<p>Finally, much later on in Jewish legal history a ban was placed on reading the private communications of others. This decree originally applied to mail but many authorities now extend it to all forms of communication.</p>
<p>These considerations all apply today and would apply to governments as well.</p>
<p>However, none of these considerations overrides the sanctity of life. If just one life could be saved it seems that all these rules could be ignored. Certainly, it would be expected that the minimal intrusion to save the life would be made. Saving a life is not a license to do as one pleases. Further, use of the information gathered would be limited to the purpose of saving lives and nothing else.The interesting thing here is that one life is enough for all our privacy to be suspended. One life is all it takes.</p>
<p>It would seem that as long as lives are being saved, the government is not bound by the strict privacy laws or decrees. The question then becomes whether lives are actually being saved. I don’t know the answer to that question. But that is the issue. It is the only issue.If there is a threat of loss of life, the government or any private citizen would have the right and according to some authorities the obligation to spy on its citizens to protect others.</p>
<p>I think it is laudible that the government takes the lives of its citizens so seriously. Obviously there are concerns that the government will use the information obtained improperly. However, there can be no prohibition against the gathering of the information so long as lives are at stake.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7081" alt="91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_-230x300.jpg" width="230" height="300" /></a>Over the weekend it was reported that a teacher in an orthodox Jewish school in Seattle has been charged with molesting two six year old girls in his class. It is suspected that this fellow molested more than just the two girls but he is only charged with molesting the two girls.</p>
<p>Sex abuse happens everywhere. It is no indictment of a school, community, or family if sex abuse occurs. The test is how sex abuse is dealt with. The most important question is whether the victim is able to articulate that they have been abused and that the victim has a safe place to talk about the abuse. If no one comes forward there is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>It takes great courage to come forward. But more importantly, it takes education to come forward. Our best defense against abuse is quite simply our children. If they are equipped with the tools necessary to prevent molestation and report it when it happens we have our first two lines of defense in place.</p>
<p>The prosecutor in the case in Seattle attributes the girls&#8217; willingness to come forward and their ability to articulate what happened to a book that is the brainchild of Rabbi Yakov Horowitz, written by Bracha Goetz and illustrated by Tova Leff. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a>. Incredibly, it took years for this book to see the light of day. But now it is endorsed by leading Torah authorities and it must be in every home and every school.</p>
<p><span id="more-7080"></span></p>
<p>In a sensitive way, the book gives children the tools to prevent abuse. When the book was released, I bought several copies of the book for my home and anywhere else I thought it necessary.</p>
<p>Just consider for a moment how incredible it is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> helped end a cycle of abuse in Seattle. It could do the same in your community. Get the book.</p>
<p>In places where abuse is not reported and not even acknowledged there is too much space for predators to wreak havoc. It is a matter of <em>sakanas nefashos, </em>we must act now. Our children must be educated. There are no excuses. We must educate our most insular communities on the harms of abuse and help them help themselves get out from under the cycle of abuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> is so versatile that it is not only a book that prevents abuse. The book also keeps children safe generally. Rabbi Horowitz shared with me a letter that he received from a learning disabled child thanking him for the book as it helped him in several situations. The letter is so sweet and innocent, it brought tears to my eyes. It is time for us to take this challenge and grab it by the horns. The first step is buying and using this book.</p>
<p>Aside from the book, Rabbi Horowitz has an excellent video on keeping our children safe. Watch that here: <a href="http://youtu.be/LWQHaInsCGk" target="_blank">YouTube</a></p>
