				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kosher Switch has been in development for several years. According to the inventor, the device replaces the standard light switch and through the magic of technology and Jewish law allows Shabbat observant Jews to switch their lights on and off. Last week, the company launched a campaign on Indiegogo to raise funds to satisfy minimum manufacturer requirements and begin production. The promotional video claims that leading rabbinic authorities approve the device for Shabbat use. In response, a proclamation signed by prominent American rabbinic authorities warned residents of Flatbush that the device was not kosher for Shabbat use and it should not be brought into one&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>A lot of the subsequent discussion has been somewhat juvenile. Questions about motive, credibility, and consistency have been raised in all directions and accusations of impropriety have been levied as well. To me, this is all just a distraction from the real issue here: <strong>Is the Kosher Switch Kosher? [Please show your work]</strong></p>
<p>Instead of delving into the religio-legal issues raised by the Kosher Switch, I find far too much of the discourse to be declarative and even in the rare case that arguments are made in favor or against the device, the articles read like persuasive briefs instead of dispassionate legal jurisprudence. I have read everything I could find and would like to present both sides of the issue as I see it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Needless to say, this discussion is for educational purposes only. If you are looking for a psak, ask a posek.</strong></em><span id="more-9185"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Prohibition</strong></p>
<p>I. Flipping a light switch on Shabbat might be a Biblical prohibition, but according to many opinions it might be a rabbinic prohibition.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9190" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/electricity-05.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="electricity-05" data-recalc-dims="1" /> If it is Biblical, one set of principles applies, and if it is rabbinic, another package of principles apply. Activating a circuit is presumed to be prohibited, but as has been noted, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to identify the actual prohibition. Lighting an incandescent bulb is the most likely candidate for Biblical prohibition due to the heating of the coils and the heat that it emits. But we live in a fluorescent world, and I think we can assume that the Kosher Switch is trying to solve a rabbinic problem as opposed to a Biblical problem.</p>
<p>II. The Torah forbids mindful acts of Shabbat desecration. Thus, there are several leniencies that can theoretically mitigate Biblical prohibition. When one performs an action that unwittingly causes a prohibited result it is permissible. This is called davar sh&#8217;eino mitkaven. But the leniency only applies as long as the unintended result was not inevitable, otherwise it is prohibited. This principle is called psik reisha, and the action is Biblically prohibited. However, if the unintended result of the action is undesirable it is called a psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei and it is not Biblically prohibited. There is a dispute among the Medieval commentators whether a psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei is still rabbinically prohibited or if it is permissible.</p>
<p>III. There is a secondary dispute among the late Medieval and Renaissance commentators when a psik reisha only produces a rabbinically prohibited result. Some say it is still prohibited rabbinically, and others say it is completely permissible. Even those who prohibit in these cases may allow psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei. Some prohibit even in such cases, and others only allow under certain conditions.</p>
<p>IV. When it&#8217;s unknown if the psik reisha resulted in a prohibition it is called a safeik psik reisha. One late Renaissance opinion holds this would not even be considered a psik reisha, and is not prohibited at all. One Contemporary authority rules that safeik psik reisha is permissible when the result is rabbinically prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Proximate Cause</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Indirectly causing a prohibited result is called grama. The Talmud offers two seemingly contradictory positions on grama. One is permitted to place vessels filled with water in the path of a fire. The fire will be extinguished by the water in the vessels, and extinguishing fire is normally prohibited. The Talmud explains that this is a permissible case of grama. However, the Talmud also prohibits tossing wheat with its chaff into the wind to separate the kernel from the chaff, even though that appears to be a grama as well. Several narrowing definitions of grama have been proposed to reconcile this issue.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>When there is a time lapse between the action and the result it is considered a grama. It will take some time for the water to be released from the vessels but the chaff will be removed from the wheat almost immediately.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is only when the indirect cause is the normal manner in which the result is achieved. Normally, one would not extinguish a fire by placing vessels of water in its path, but one <em>would</em> toss wheat in the air to winnow.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is only when the person completes the indirect act, and an intervening act is still needed to cause the prohibited result. The water is trapped in vessels that are a distance away from the fire, so the fire must travel and burst the vessels.  In the case of the wheat, the wind is <em>already</em> blowing when one throws the wheat in the air.</li>
<li>Or perhaps grama is only when the prohibited result is not inevitable. There is no guarantee that the fire will be extinguished by the water in the vessels but it&#8217;s certain that the wind will remove some chaff from the wheat.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Grama is not a blanket permission. The general consensus is that grama is only allowed in cases of great need. Some Modern and Contemporary authorities hold that grama would also be permissible when the result is not desired.</li>
<li>One Contemporary rabbinic authority holds that oneg Shabbat (pleasure of Shabbat) is considered a great need.   <strong><br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Not Even a Grama</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>The foremost Renaissance halachic authority for Ashkenazi Jewry says one can leave a candle near a door if the wind is not blowing, even if the wind will eventually blow. He also holds that grama is only permissible in cases of financial loss, and since here he makes no such stipulation, it can be assumed that he holds this is not even a case of grama.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is when the other contributing factor causing the prohibition exists. But where the wind is not blowing, the thing that is needed to complete the act does not even exist at the time of human act.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is when the human act is <em>connected</em> to the thing that will complete the prohibited act. The human is only opening a door to let the wind blow. The wind is the thing doing the extinguishing and the act is not connected to the wind.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Kosher Switch</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Basically, two things are happening inside the Kosher Switch. First, there is an emitter and a receiver that complete a circuit. When the emitter and receiver are active, the circuit is complete and the light is on. The second component is a barrier that creates a blockage between emitter and receiver when the switch is flipped.</li>
<li>When the light is on, the emitter and receiver cycle through sleep and active periods and an indicator will tell the user when they are asleep. The user will move the barrier by flipping the switch, and at a random time, the emitter will try to connect to the receiver. If it cannot connect, the circuit will be disrupted and the light will turn off. When the emitter and receiver are sleeping, an indicator tells the user it&#8217;s safe to move the switch. If the barrier is moved, the emitter and receiver will communicate at a random time and will attempt to complete the circuit. Even when the barrier is removed, the emitter and receiver do not automatically connect. They both randomly generate codes that must &#8220;match&#8221; in order to complete the circuit. After each failed attempt, the emitter will try connected again at a random time. If the barrier has not been moved, the emitter will not see the receiver and the light will remain off.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Show Your Work</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Flipping the Kosher Switch does not directly turn the lights on or off.<img class="alignright wp-image-9188 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/KosherSwitch1.jpg?resize=449%2C600" alt="KosherSwitch1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></li>
<li>Assuming it is considered a psik reisha, the result is a rabbinically prohibited act. This is permissible according to some authorities.</li>
<li>Assuming a psik reisha that produces a rabinically prohibited act is still prohibited, the act of flipping the switch might be a safeik psik reisha. This is permissible according to some authorities.</li>
<li>It might be a grama because there is a time lapse between the switch flip and the circuit completing.</li>
<li>It might be a grama because an intervening act, by the emitter and receiver, is needed to complete the circuit.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s possible that it could be a grama because the Kosher Switch is not the normal manner one turns on a light. Maybe.</li>
<li>If the light is considered oneg Shabbat, grama plus a &#8220;great need&#8221; would render the switch permissible according to some.</li>
<li>It might not be a grama at all, because the current is totally dead at the time of the act. Non-grama is certainly permissible.</li>
<li>Or it might not be grama at all because the human act is not connected to the emitter and receiver. The human act only connects to the switch and barrier.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Objections</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Rabbi Rozen says: &#8220;Even if they added to the ‘Grama’ additional apparatuses, and even if there is a one in a thousand chance that the action will not occur, I have received from my rabbis (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and R. Shaul Yisraeli) that this does not change in any way the halakhic status of regular ‘grama’ (just like grama D’grama and other artificial arrangements).&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Rozen says: &#8220;Even if the method of operation is non-active from the point of view of the agent, i.e. because he merely removes the “preventing element,” Rabbi S. Z. Auerbach and others wrote that this remains forbidden and is treated like it was done directly by the person, since the action occurs immediately after the human intervention/action. Even if the result comes only after a delay caused by an additional factor, this is plain grama, which is still not permitted L’chatchila.&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Student argues that the Kosher Switch is only a grama according to some opinions and even a grama is not permissible ab initio.</li>
<li>Rabbi Tzvi Ortner says: &#8220;We must question whether a case can be built for permissibility based on what the Gemara does not say. That is, the fact that the Gemara does not speak of the halacha of something that has not entered the world does not prove that this case is less than a grama. Perhaps this case is deemed a grama too!&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Tzvi Ortner says: &#8220;Even should this logic be sound, one can hardly call the pulses “not in this world,” since the switch is designed for the function to turn on intermittently. It is an absolute certainty that the force will come back into existence, and this is by design. Even if we could find a case of wind that is not “in this world” that is permissible, this is only because the effect is not under man’s control, which thus “distances” his action from the eventual force (see Magen Avraham 328:53). However, the pulses in the Kosher Switch are designed and controlled by man to arrive with continuity, and thus bear no comparison to the case of the wind, which is beyond his control.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Possible Responses</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Okay, but there is precedent for &#8220;not even grama&#8221; under similar circumstances. Not everyone has to agree with what you received from your rabbis.</li>
<li>Right, but this is a switch that is delayed and also dependent on random emitter and receiver contact which could have legal implications according to some precedents. Further, even if it is a grama, it could be combined with oneg Shabbat to establish a &#8220;great need.&#8221;</li>
<li>There is a solid argument, with precedent, to say that it is not even grama. And again, even if it is grama it might be okay.</li>
<li>The Talmud doesn&#8217;t say it, but the foremost Renaissance rabbinic authority seems to hold this way.</li>
<li>Sure, this is possible. But so is the alternative proposed by Kosher Switch proponents. It might be different than the wind, but it might be similar as well.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So there you have it. A legitimate discussion about Kosher Switch from a religio-legal perspective.</p>
<p>It seems like two things might be happening here. It&#8217;s possible that the opponents of the Kosher Switch did not read through the responsa on the Kosher Switch website. All their questions are covered in their materials. But I think there is something deeper happening here as well. I have a feeling that the Kosher Switch proponents are using a different paradigm than the opponents.</p>
<p>The opponents seem to hold that in order for something to be permissible it needs to work according to all established rabbinic authorities. The Kosher Switch certainly does not meet that bar. Kosher Switch proponents hold that in order for something to be prohibited it needs to not work according to all established rabbinic authorities. Unfortunately, both sides seem to believe that their approach is the only correct approach so they do not acknowledge the validity of their opponents.</p>
<p>This represents a huge gap between two acceptable ways to look at halacha. I do think that the idea that we should try to satisfy all halachic precedent has some roots in the Talmud. But the importance and universal emphasis we give to this idea is somewhat a new innovation. It&#8217;s prominent in the Mishna Berura, a 20th century compilation and commentary on one section of the Code of Jewish Law. The Chofetz Chaim seems to have attempted to select and codify the halachic opinions that were most universally held. Today, the idea is very prominent in Brisk and its progeny. The hallmark of this approach is its lack of self confidence and self reliance. We are nervous that we are not doing it right so we try to fulfill as many positions as possible because one of them has got to be right.</p>
<p>We also have a tradition of &#8220;koach d&#8217;hetera adif&#8221; &#8211; the power to permit is great, and the concept of &#8220;limud zechus&#8221; &#8211; trying to find any halachic path to justify questionable behavior. The Aruch HaShulchan, by Rav Yechiel Michel Epstein, an exhaustive restatement of Jewish law written in the late 19th century, is known for its efforts on this side of the halachic coin. Rabbi Epstein tried to be machria and choose a path but he presented a potpourri of acceptable opinions in every section. It seems that this tradition is less prominent in our society. The hallmark of this approach is autonomy and courage. We try to research a topic as best we can, and attempt to forge a personal path that rings true to our genuinely held religious convictions.</p>
<p>I do harbor some concerns that our preference for the former over the latter is having a net negative impact on 21st century Orthodox Judaism. A society that looks for stringencies and looks down upon those with a different approach to Jewish law can become extremely uncomfortable for its non-conformist constituents. Autonomy and self confidence are authentic Torah values too. We ignore them at our peril.</p>
<p>This dispute might be a case study of this dichotomy or I might be completely off the mark, but either way, researching this topic inspired this idea in me. I believe there is a valid halachic path that permits the Shabbos Switch. I also acknowledge that this path will not be universally held. I think that&#8217;s okay. Variety and diversity can be good things. Let&#8217;s try to bring a little more of that back into our world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Someone asked me a question yesterday that cuts to the core of the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/01/the-shabbos-app-yes-it-is-real/" target="_blank">Shabbos App</a> issue. It was something like this: <em>&#8220;If the Shabbos App was halachically permissible, would you use it?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>My answer is that I would not. I like my Shabbat experience the way it is right now. I don&#8217;t particularly want to add smartphones to my Shabbat experience.</p>
<p>That is the real issue here. The halachic question about whether it is permissible or prohibited and why is a fascinating and important discussion, but it&#8217;s relatively obscure and esoteric. Digging into the nitty-gritty halachic nuances is enjoyable for me, but I think we have to look at the big picture and examine the social and communal issues raised by the Shabbos App.</p>
<p>To me, it&#8217;s real simple.<span id="more-8875"></span> No one would have thought of the Shabbos App or the need for the Shabbos App if people were enjoying the break from technology that Shabbat affords.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/02/shabbos-app-tragic-commentary/iber/" rel="attachment wp-att-8876"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8876" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/iber.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="iber" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> If we all loved being off our phones for 25 hours, the Shabbos App would be superfluous. No one would want it. No one would care to have it. But that is not the reality.</p>
<p>Many people struggle with observing Shabbat every week. The phone is a private and quiet way to escape Shabbat observance. That&#8217;s one the many allures of the smartphone. It&#8217;s like holding the universe in your hands, and if someone is feeling stifled by Shabbat observance, the world in one&#8217;s hands can feel quite liberating.</p>
<p>I think most people who have smartphones would be quite happy to be able to use them 24/7. It&#8217;s a bit of a challenge to restrict one&#8217;s smartphone usage for 25 hours if one is accustomed to using their device on a constant basis. It&#8217;s not addiction as much as it is a habit. Smartphones have become like appendages to our bodies. They accompany us to the kitchen for recipes and culinary inspiration. They come with us to the dinner table and can be used to research a point of discussion at the table or to share a YouTube video that gives everyone a good laugh. They are part of our Torah study routine with the entire Torah available at the tap of a finger. Calling us addicts completely mischaracterizes the challenge. Our devices are like auxiliary brains. They are part of everything we do during the week.</p>
<p>So when Shabbat arrives, it is certainly a challenge. Some people embrace this challenge. They say that Shabbat is meaningful because they love being free from technology. It&#8217;s still a challenge, but the personal satisfaction and ecstasy of freedom makes it worth meeting the challenge head on. Others just accept the fact that they might be miserable without their devices and slog through Shabbat like zombies. Then there are the people who don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s worth giving up their smartphones for Shabbat. The pain of abandoning technology for 25 hours is greater than the payoff of keeping Shabbat. Those people have no incentive to turn off their phones for 25 hours. Why should they?</p>
<p>That is a tragic commentary on our Shabbat experience.</p>
<p>One solution might be to allow for a halachic revolution or a slower halachic evolution to a place and time where using smartphones is halachically acceptable. Another might be to figure out methods of minimizing the desecration of Shabbat to the best of our ability. But I prefer a third option.</p>
<p>The best solution is to craft Shabbat experiences that are meaningful to American Orthodox Jews. This can be done in several ways and should be personalized to each individual person. We need Shabbat programming and meals and prayer services and activities that enhance Shabbat. The existing version of Shabbat works for a lot of people. Friday night services with some singing, family dinner that is almost exactly the same every week and in every home, a family game or a book, sleep, wake up 8:30 AM or later, head to shul, pray and listen to a sermon, grab some nosh at kiddush, eat a big lunch that is almost exactly the same every week and in every home, sing some songs, schmooze, take a nap, go for a walk, play with the kids / siblings / friends, wind down in the evening, mincha, seuda shlishit, maariv, havdala, and pizza for melaveh malka. That sounds heavenly to tons of Orthodox Jews. They wouldn&#8217;t trade it for the world. It&#8217;s better than anything you can get on a smartphone.</p>
<p>But many people don&#8217;t like all the stuff or they might like it but not in the way that it&#8217;s currently configured. We can recalibrate. We can add and subtract within the boundaries of halacha. The experience could be more customized and appeal to each person&#8217;s preferences. In particular, we should focus on the benefits of a digital fast in our modern world so that it becomes something we subjectively want to do. We don&#8217;t need a standardized version of Shabbat. If Shabbat feels like a burden, there are ways to change it up so that it becomes a joy. When we love our Shabbat experience, the smartphone loses its appeal. We are tuned into our Shabbat experience. That&#8217;s better than being tuned out of Shabbat and tuned into our smartphones.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious to me that this is the way forward. It&#8217;s what we discussed in the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/08/a-solution-keeping-the-orthodox-orthodox/" target="_blank">essay</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">series</a> a couple weeks ago. There is a version of Shabbat that is needlessly canonized, and it is to our detriment that it is. We have this idea in our heads that the meaning and lessons of Shabbat or other mitzvot are objective. I&#8217;ve heard a ton of comments that sound like <em>&#8220;but Shabbat is about X</em>&#8221; while the other commenter says <em>&#8220;Shabbat is about Y.&#8221;</em> It&#8217;s about what we make it. It&#8217;s subjective. This is not really a debatable point. So let&#8217;s think creatively. We all know the basic Shabbat rules and rituals that must be included in the experience. So let&#8217;s start from the beginning. To borrow a tech metaphor, let&#8217;s reboot. What would a Shabbat experience look like if we started building it right now? And how many other options and versions can we dream up? Let&#8217;s do it. Let&#8217;s try them. Let&#8217;s create our own subjective Shabbat experiences. Let&#8217;s make them really cool and really interesting. Let&#8217;s make our Shabbat better than anything a smartphone can offer. Let&#8217;s make the Shabbos App completely useless.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Shabbos App was introduced to the world this week. A lot of people think it&#8217;s a hoax. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s very, very real.</p>
<p>Several people asked me what I thought about the app and I wanted to speak with someone at the Shabbos App before I wrote anything. I had a nice conversation with one of the people working on the app and feel comfortable writing about the app, their ambitions, and the consequences.</p>
<p>Almost everyone working on the app is Shomer Shabbos. This is not a subversive attempt to ruin Shabbat or pull people away from Orthodox Judaism. Rather, the app is for Orthodox Jews who want to observe Shabbat <em>and</em> use their smartphones. The developers spent considerable time and effort researching halachic reasoning and opinions on the subject. They know what they are doing and what they are up against.<span id="more-8857"></span></p>
<p><em>I am not an expert on these matters.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/01/the-shabbos-app-yes-it-is-real/halfshabbos1-635x355/" rel="attachment wp-att-8858"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8858" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/halfshabbos1-635x355.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="halfshabbos1-635x355" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> I have studied them several times in various forums, so I am familiar with the general principles and arguments. <strong>Do not rely on anything I say here.</strong></em></p>
<p>Briefly, the issue of electricity on Shabbat is not simple. Every Orthodox Jew knows that it&#8217;s prohibited. Many know about the psak of the Chazon Ish who prohibited electricity based on the <em>melacha</em> (Biblically forbidden creative activity) of <em>boneh</em> (building) because activating an electric device involves completing a circuit which is a form of building. Many people also know that this is not considered an accurate description of electricity or boneh by Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. Rabbi Auerbach famously concluded that although there is no particular forbidden labor that precludes use of electricity per se; it is forbidden because that has become the accepted halachic tradition in Orthodox Judaism. At most, this would be a Rabbinic prohibition.</p>
<p>This rule applies to electricity in general. There are electrical devices that can violate possible Biblical prohibitions. Using a microwave might be bishul, or lighting an incandescent bulb might be <em>mav&#8217;ir</em>. Smartphones raise another set of issues which are particular to modern personal electronics. I don&#8217;t think any of these would be Biblical prohibitions either. The greatest obstacle is probably<em> tikun maneh</em> or <em>makeh b&#8217;patish</em>, but these issues have already been handled with regard to electrical appliances that use a Sabbath (really Yom Tov) Mode. Once again, the Shabbos App team is comfortable navigating these areas of halacha. The problems raised by draining battery, writing, lighting the screen, generating sounds, and charging can be circumvented with technological workarounds. The Shabbos App does all this by running in the background of the smartphone and controlling those problem areas in a way that prevents the issues. Apparently, the Android OS is more flexible in this regard and thus presents a more robust solution. But even in Apple iOS, the app is functional and would potentially avoid all violations of Rabbinic prohibitions.</p>
<p>So it is real. And it actually does what they say it does. At least in terms of the technical aspects of halacha, it seems to avoid violating Shabbat prohibitions according to accepted halachic opinions.</p>
<p>The motivations of the Shabbos App team are genuine and holy. There are people who use smartphones on Shabbat right now. The way they use them is more likely to incur serious halachic problems. As a consequence, those who use them often feel very guilty.  Not to say that they shouldn&#8217;t feel this way, but guilt can morph into a form of religious self-loathing that triggers further departures from observance in other areas. This is a terrible result. The Shabbos App might assuage some of that guilt and keep more people in the fold. They might be right about that too. I am also very sympathetic to the emotional needs of people struggling with observance and I can corroborate the guilt slicked journey off the path. I am not expressing an opinion on the importance of this effort, or whether it outweighs considerations in the other direction. But it&#8217;s a valid concern. Further, if it is permissible to use a smartphone in this manner, then maybe they actually should be used.</p>
<p>So far, the objections to the app carry a familiar tune. In essence, the problem with the Shabbos App is that even if it is halachically acceptable, it will ruin the spirit of Shabbat. I am sympathetic to this point of view as well. There is something beautiful about avoiding technology on Shabbat. Recently I advocated using the digital fast concept as a social benefit to keeping Shabbat on this blog. I think it might be worth turning off our devices for Shabbat even if devices were permissible. However, Rabbi Heinemann addressed this concern when similar objections were raised against his Sabbath Mode ovens. His response was that if something is permissible then it can&#8217;t ruin the spirit of Shabbat. There&#8217;s no such thing. He supported his position by noting that when the Aruch HaShulchan or Rabbi Auerbach permitted the use of telephones on Shabbat the spirit of Shabbat was not a concern. Further, when they backtracked and prohibited the use of phones on Shabbat, they did not hang their hats on the spirit of Shabbat. Telephones were prohibited based on halachic concerns, not spirit of Shabbat concerns. When I asked the Shabbos App developer what Shabbat would look like if everyone would be using their smartphones, his answer reflected this sensibility. He said <em>&#8220;Shabbat will look the way Hashem wants it to look!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>What&#8217;s going to happen when the app is released? Almost all Orthodox rabbis will prohibit it. That&#8217;s almost a near certainty. But what will the people do? Most adults will listen to their rabbis. I suspect that younger demographics might consider the Shabbos App. If they do, they will probably need to hide their smartphone use. I can&#8217;t see Orthodox Judaism adopting the app and its halachic implications en masse in the near future. But it is possible that as we become more and more dependent on technology, especially passive technology, there will be a natural movement toward greater leniency. If that does happen, I think we might look back on the Shabbat App and see it as a catalyst for that change. In the meantime, I don&#8217;t expect any significant change in the way Orthodox Jews think about smartphones, but at the very least we will be forced to talk about these issues with more halachic rigor and discussion. That is definitely a good thing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Randi Zuckerberg, sister of Mark Zuckerberg, inventor of the Internet, or something like that, published an article in the Daily Mail about Internet use. It’s a promo for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062285149/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062285149&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank">recently published book called Dot Complicated</a>. Her premise in the article is that being too digitally attached is causing us to forget to live our lives.</p>
<p>She talks a bit about the idea of a Digital Sabbath that is gaining in popularity. Taking one day off from our gadgets and simply spending quality time with our loved ones.</p>
<p><span id="more-7847"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/unplug.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7848" alt="unplug" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/unplug.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Further, she urges us to be aware of the difference between communicating via the Internet and communicated face to face or even through a phone call. It’s much more personal to directly tell close one about news or happenings in one’s life. Just because the Internet makes it easier, does not mean it should substitute for more traditional means of communication in all instances.</p>
<p>I have two things to say about this article.</p>
<p>First, while a Digital Sabbath is a superb idea and I love that it’s finding mainstream acceptance, I am loathe to use this as a reason to observe Shabbos. To me, Shabbos is an eternal day. It hearkens back to the earliest recorded moments of our religious history. It is the basis for Torah observance. It is not to be relegated to some digital vacation. It&#8217;s much more than that. And it&#8217;s been observed for millennia. Facebook is 9 years old.</p>
<p>I love the idea that other people are finding value in unplugging. I find it valuable too. But I really don’t like the idea that this is the primary idea of what Shabbos has become about. No. Shabbos is not a day to unplug. It’s a day to <em>plug in</em>. We <em>plug in</em> to our families, our spirituality, extra Torah study, our communities, our progress from week to week. We are to emulate God’s “rest” after a “work week” and experience that which we’ve created.</p>
<p>People who need a Digital Sabbath are welcome to join our eternal Sabbath. But we are the Sabbath hipsters. We were doing it before it was cool and for reasons far more eternal than escaping notifications from Facebook and emails.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are two elements to turning off. One part is to breathe. Experience life. Enjoy life. The other part is tuning in to others. I think both needs must be satisfied. We need our own space and we need to give ourselves to others.</p>
<p>Shabbos actually manages to give us both. Proper prayer is akin to meditation. It focuses us. It’s a way of returning to ourselves. Use the extended prayer service as a way to come in contact with yourself. We follow that up with a kiddush or a Shabbos meal. This is our opportunity to interact with others without distraction. There are no work distractions, there are no cooking distractions, there are no e-distractions. We enjoy our friends and family and give them the human interaction that we all crave. Spend that time well. It&#8217;s not to wasted.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that we take care of both of these needs to maximize our Shabbos experience. Take time for yourself and make time for others. Eliminate the distractions and together we celebrate another week of progress and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Shabbos has a way of celebrating the end of the previous week and setting the the tone for the following week. Digital Sabbaths are great, but the original Sabbath is even better. If you are ever looking for a unique Shabbos experience, come join us at the Shul on the Beach in Venice.</p>

<p>In an article, semi-appropriately named <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2010/12/people-of-the-e-book-observant-jews-struggle-with-sabbath-in-a-digital-age/68289/" target="_blank">People of the E-Book? Observant Jews Struggle With Sabbath in a Digital Age</a>, Uri Friedman contemplates the future of e-readers in the hands of orthodox Jews. It&#8217;s only a semi-appropriate headline because I don&#8217;t think many orthodox Jews are actually struggling with this issue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why this is an article worth writing. Orthodox Jews are a tiny segment of the population and do not participate in many rites of popular culture. For some reason, Friedman found this a subject worth writing on.</p>
<p>I have some comments on his article and some thoughts on e-readers as they pertain to orthodox Jews irrespective of the article.</p>
<p>First of all, I am impressed that Friedman knows that some prohibit electricity on Shabbos because of &#8220;boneh&#8221; (building), as you complete a circuit by &#8220;flipping the switch&#8221;. Nice job!<span id="more-3522"></span></p>
<p>The article also draws an interesting parallel between the proliferation of electronic devices and the move to the suburbs in the 50&#8217;s that resulted in a weakening of Shabbos commitment when conservative and reform Jews began driving to Shul in Shabbos.</p>
<p>But something really bothered me. Friedman does a nice job of including thoughts on the subject by orthodox, conservative and reform Jews. What was disturbing is what can be inferred from their quotes.</p>
<p>The first orthodox fellow believes that someone will invent a workaround solution. Since orthodox Jews are so desperate for an Shabbos e-reader someone will surely invent one. Similar to a timed light, the Shabbos e-reader would turn pages at regular intervals. This idea is insane and will never work. (Do I need to explain why this is dumb? Have you ever read a book?) There is no excuse for mentioning this in a respectable article.</p>
<p>The conservative rabbi in the article expresses reservations about using e-readers on Shabbos because they distract from the beauty of Shabbos. This is a noble idea. Unfortunately, most conservative Jews I know, watch TV on Shabbos. An e-reader is not less of a &#8220;distraction&#8221; than TV.</p>
<p>But here is the rub. The orthodox Jew looks like a halachic obsessive who is willing to break the &#8220;spirit of Shabbos&#8221; via an automated e-reader device. The conservative Jew is more concerned about the spiritual parts of Shabbos and even if e-readers are permissible would be sad if they distracted from the &#8220;spirit of Shabbos&#8221;.</p>
<p>I wish the article had not given this impression.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not really true. Orthodox Jews care about the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. That&#8217;s why orthodox Jews don&#8217;t leave their TVs on timers over Shabbos. Some orthodox Jews don&#8217;t use dish washers on timers for the same reason.</p>
<p>To portray the orthodox Jews as those who ignore the spirit of the law is unfair.</p>
<p>As to the issue raised in the article about e-readers and Shabbos. I have resisted buying an e-reader and e-books for a completely different reason.</p>
<p>Most of the books read in my home are from the library. They are free. We don&#8217;t pay $10 for books. Until there is an e-reader subscription where you can read all the books you want for a reasonable monthly fee I cannot imagine paying $200 to have the lucky fortune of buying books for $10 a piece. That is the real reason I am not buying an e-reader. It is true that I read a little more on Shabbos than other days but I read enough during the week that I would love to have an e-reader. I have a nice computer, a Wii, a PS3, an iPod, and iPhone and I only use those during the week too. Who cares?</p>
<p>E-readers are the future. But as long as there is a printing press and people own printers there is no <em>need</em> for orthodox Jews to compromise their commitment to halacha or the spirit of Shabbos.</p>
<p>However, if electricity becomes so ubiquitous that in order to avoid it on Shabbos, orthodox Jews would need to live like the Amish, it is possible that the halachic authorities will reconsider the original decision to consider use of electricity a violation of Shabbos. At that point anything is possible.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to experience a taste of Shabbos with no e-readers, come to the Shul on the Beach where we read from a handwritten Torah scroll and pray from old fashioned books.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I wrote about Esther Petrack, the modern orthodox contestant on America&#8217;s Next Top Model (ANTM). I responded to a post I read on Tablet Magazine that reported a conversation on the show purporting to show that Esther gave up Shabbos observance to pursue a career in modeling. See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/16/esther-petrack-modern-orthodox-jewish-girl-on-americas-next-top-model-drops-shabbos-on-television/">Esther Petrack: Modern Orthodox Jewish Girl on America’s Next Top Model Drops Shabbos on Television</a></p>
<p>Esther is popular and the post has been the most popular post on this blog since the day it was written. The point of the post was two-fold. One, there is a drama (contrived or real) to seeing someone drop their observance. One moment they are observnt and the next they are not. I found that drama (real or contrived) compelling. Second, the writer at Tablet claimed this was a &#8220;blow to modern orthodoxy&#8221;. I vehemently disagree. All streams of Judaism have defectors and even if Esther was &#8220;leaving&#8221; modern orthodoxy it was no &#8220;blow&#8221;, just a causalty like any other young adult choosing a different life from their parents.</p>
<p>Last night, Esther&#8217;s mom (Marina) commented on the original post.<span id="more-3104"></span> (link: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/16/esther-petrack-modern-orthodox-jewish-girl-on-americas-next-top-model-drops-shabbos-on-television/#comment-88136106">Marina&#8217;s Comment</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p>The fateful words &#8220;I will do it&#8221; in an answer to the question about working on shabbat were the result of editing. Esther never meant or said that she would give up shabbat for the show, neither did she do it. These words were taken from a long conversation about the principles and laws of shabbat and how Esther was planning to observe them. The producers cut out these 4 words to create a more scandalous storyline; judging from the amount of reaction, they were quite successful!</p></blockquote>
<p>This is very exciting news! It is obscene that ANTM found it necessary to manufacture drama at the cost of someone&#8217;s religious beliefs but on the other hand, it is a relief that it was manufactured.</p>
<p>I apologize to Esther, her friends and family and any other persons affected by the assumption that the edited conversation depicted something close to reality. It seems it was not &#8220;reality television&#8221; rather it was &#8220;manufactured television&#8221;. I will leave the original post up with a link to this post and Marina&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>Marina added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Careful viewers could see that there was editing and I would have hoped that non careful readers would have gieven Esther the benefit of the doubt, kaf zechut&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some people saw that and correctly did not assume. Kudos to them and to the rest of us, the rebuke is warranted.</p>
<p>Finally:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m proud of Esther&#8217;s midot and comittment to mitzvot which she carried through the show. As a cute example, since you probably know that the girls were housed in a house overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Venice, Esther used the ocean to [ritually] dunk (tovel) a pot she bought to cook for herself in the house.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that nice?</p>
<p>Plus, I had no idea that Esther was so close to my shul &#8211; I would have invited her for a shabbos meal if I had known&#8230; And apparently, Esther remained committed to her Jewish heritage and principles while on the show. Nothing could make me prouder.</p>
<p><strong>Readers: Please help spread the word that Esther was harshly edited by ATNM and she never gave up Shabbos. It was wrong of them to edit her that way and now that we know the truth we have a responsibility to fix the wrong. </strong></p>

<p><strong>MUST READ UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/19/esther-petracks-mother-speaks-esther-is-observant-it-was-all-editing/">Esther Petrack’s Mother Speaks: Esther is observant, it was all editing</a></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/19/esther-petracks-mother-speaks-esther-is-observant-it-was-all-editing/"></a><a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/45110/‘antm’-contestant-to-forego-observance/#" target="_blank">Tablet Magazine reports</a> that there is a Modern Orthodox girl from Massachusetts on America&#8217;s Next Top Model with Tyra Banks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always cool to see a fellow member of the tribe on TV show, even a reality show. It is more than a little counter-intuitive to see a Jewish girl competing for a modeling contract when you consider the tradition of tznius (something akin to modesty) that has been a hallmark of observant Judaism. In fact it probably breaches most tznius standards to just participate in a reality show, but certainly a show that celebrates the barely clothed human body.</p>
<p>Yet, I was still wondering (hoping?) that somehow Esther would follow the lead of her biblical namesake (Queen Esther of Purim fame) and somehow make a kiddush Hashem (glorification of Godliness) on the show.</p>
<p>Tablet Magazine reports the following conversation took place:<span id="more-2843"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>After letting Esther say a bit about herself—namely, that she was born in Jerusalem—[Tyra] asked her about her Orthodox Jewish practice. “Do you honor the Sabbath?”</p>
<p>“Yes I do,” Esther responded, proceeding to explain the rules regarding the usage of electricity, computers, cell phones, and cars on Friday night and Saturday. Tyra sternly informed her that <em>ANTM</em> contestants work all the time, seven days a week. &#8230; Would Esther, Tyra wanted to know, be able to adhere to the <em>ANTM</em> work schedule? Her Jewish identity was all of a sudden squarely on the spot&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;She replied after a momentary hesitation: “Yes, I would do it.”</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE</strong>: There is a good chance that this was edited to sound worse than it actually was live. I really hope that is the case. However, the feelings I experienced READING the transcript are colored by the way CW depicted the conversation. My main point is not relevant to whether Esther is a Shomer Shabbos or not. I hope she still is&#8230;</em></p>
<p>I know many non-observant Jews. I know many Jews who &#8220;honored the Sabbath&#8221; at some time in their life and no longer &#8220;honor the Sabbath&#8221;. This is different. Not because she is on TV or seeking a career in modeling. It&#8217;s different because the world saw the moment that she made the decision. We were witnesses to the &#8220;moment&#8221;. One minute she was Observant and the next moment she was not.</p>
<p>To me, that is a very dramatic moment.</p>
<p>We all have those kinds of moments in our life. That moment of choice. We are told &#8220;Choose Life&#8221;.</p>
<p>Tablet Magazine&#8217;s Dvora Meyers then goes on to write that this is another harsh blow to Modern Orthodoxy. On that point I disagree. Every sect and stream of Judaism has those who stay on that path, others move to more traditional practice and others to less practice. It is not a &#8220;problem&#8221; unique to Modern Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t think for a second that the story of Esther Petrack&#8217;s connection with her Judaism has been written and is now over. People change. Teenagers do things they later regret. Especially as we are now in the final days of Judgment and we are very aware of the power of Teshuva (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/06/essay-what-is-teshuva-repentance-and-how-does-it-work-in-judaism/">Essay: What is Teshuva (repentance) and How Does It Work in Judaism?</a>) it is important to realize that we have all done things that we regret. Esther dropped Shabbos on national TV but we have all dropped things in our lives.</p>
<p>The beauty of this time of the year is that we have a wonderful opportunity to pick things back up. Hopefully, Esther and all of us along with her will be able to pick ourselves up and be the Jewish people that we truly want to be.</p>

<p><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The Jewish Home</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #888888;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Vayetze 5769</strong></span></span></p>
<p>This week marks the first anniversary of the terrorist attack on the Chabad House in Mumbai, India. I dedicate this learning to the memory of the Holzberg, who were brutally murdered at that time.</p>
<p>This week’s Torah portion begins with the flight of Yaakov. He is a fugitive, having just snatched the primary blessings of Yitzchak from under his brother Eisav’s nose. Yaakov begins his exodus en route to the home of Lavan his mother’s brother to find his soul mate and marry her.</p>
<p>Does this storyline sound familiar? Did any other biblical characters leave their parent’s home recently?<span id="more-1731"></span> Of course we know that Avraham had just recently departed from Ur Kasdim and began his life in Eretz Yisrael. This week Yaakov begins his spirit walk from Eretz Yisrael to Charan.</p>
<p>There is one major difference however in the types of journeys that Avraham and Yaakov make. Avraham leaves with his entire family and entourage in tow. Avraham was a made man who just needed to make his life in a holier place. His life and family as a Jew were established – they just needed to move. Yaakov was running and he was running penniless, lonely and scared. This is a stark contrast to the Abrahamic journey. Rav Samson Raphael Hirsch points out this contrast to note that this is central to us as Jews.</p>
<p>Yaakov is also known as Yisrael and the only names for the Jewish people found in the Torah are the Bnei Yisrael and Beis Yaakov. We are named for Yaakov. The Jewish people are the children of Yisrael and the <em>House</em> of Yaakov. Today we read about the emergence of the <em>House </em>of Yaakov. Avraham traveled with his family and his home. Yaakov leaves with nothing and he travels to create and family and a home. He established the first Jewish home to bring the Shechina into that home through its existence. The home of Yaakov is a home where Hashem can rest His presence. And the journey to create that home begins in our Parsha. That journey has continued throughout the millennia as we ourselves embark on that same journey to build a home and bring the Shechina into that home.</p>
<p>On the night of Yaakov’s first stop he sleeps on the Temple Mount. Before resting his head he builds a rock formation to protect himself;’ this is the first home of Yaakov. During his slumber Yaakov experiences tremendous Divine revelations with eternal meaning. He witnesses angels ascending and descending a ladder. They are traveling from the Home of GD in the Heavens into the first home of Yaakov. Every Shabbos we greet angels into our home as well.</p>
<p>When Yaakov awakes he exclaims that this place is <em>Home</em> of God, a Beis Elokim. It is a place where God rests His Shechina. The Jewish home is a place where God rests His presence, and thus, is a place where we can find God.</p>
<p>Conversely, other cultures and religions preach going outside the home to “find”God. They look at nature, beauty, philosophy and they search for God. We always hear and know about people searching for God. We don’t hear too much about observant Jews “searching” for God. The observant Jew has no need to search. The message to the Jew is that God is out there but he is in fact much closer as well – he is right here in the home. God resides in the spiritual home and we create that environment for Him. This gives us tremendous power and an important opportunity that not to be missed!</p>
<p>Truthfully, our enemies knew this to be true as well. Later on in the Torah the gentile (pseudo) prophet Bilaam attempts to curse the Jewish people but is unable to do so. Despite his best efforts, he is only able to speak words of blessing.  One of the most poetic and moving sections of the entire Torah is where Bilaam exclaims “Ma Tovu Ohalecha Yaakov Mishkenosecha Yisrael,” “how excellent are your homes,” and he mentions Yaakov. Yaakov is the home and when we allow Hashem to enter we continue the journey that Yaakov began in our Parsha.</p>
<p>The most important asset to Jewish continuity is the Jewish home, which was established outside the land of Israel for the first time by Yaakov. Each one of us is maintaining that home every day. There are some people who raise the ante and are superstars in Jewish home building. Not only do those people establish a home for spirituality, they also share that home with everyone that comes their way.</p>
<p>This week is the anniversary of the terrorist attack on the Chabad House in Mumbai, India. The Holzbergs, previously of Mumbai, took home building to its most positive extreme. They were completely in a spiritual wilderness and managed to bring the Shechina to a spiritually dark corner of the earth. The Holzbergs were tremendous performers of Chesed. Rabbi Holzberg personally shechted chickens each week for all the Jews of Mumbai and for all its guests. Mrs. Holzberg baked 600 rolls per week to give the Jewish people of Mumbai and its visitors. That amount of chesed is a very strong prescription to bring the Shechina into one’s home. Working that diligently to bring Hashem into their home brought a light to their home and to India and to the world that is missed.</p>
<p>One observation I have is that this is the first time I know of that the Jewish home has been under attack. We have gone through attacks on buses, yeshivas, malls, airplanes etc. all in public places. This was the first time we were attacked in the Jewish home. To me this is something to think about. It could be the message here is that our homes are supposed to be immune to attack – but that is only when the spirituality of our collective homes is strong. Our homes have been under siege spiritually for some time now. The pitfalls of Western culture relationships and notions of love and child rearing enter our insulated homes and perhaps it has weakened us to the point where we are now vulnerable to physical attack. As long as our homes are fortresses of spirituality, we are protected but it could be that our homes have suffered from the unyielding onslaught of impurity that permeated our world, leaving us susceptible to attack.</p>
<p>In light of this view our response to terror is not – we must prevent this and raise awareness etc. or maybe if we had more political clout this would not happen or we need to fortify our homes with guns. Our response is purely to replace the missing spirituality from the world that results from their demise. We, as observers, are now charged with the task of replacing the lost chesed and the lost shechina through our own efforts. Incredibly, this is not that hard a task. What it requires from us is a commitment to the Jewish home. To reinforce those barriers that protect us from the spiritual holocaust that is our world. The commitment to continue Yaakov’s journey of building the Jewish home on our own by integrating Torah principles into our home gives the shechina its resting place in our world. The lesson of our Parsha and the lesson of lives lost is the eternal message that we don’t need to find GD – we just need to invite Him into our homes and He will find us.</p>

It is called <a href="http://www.kcet.org/local/departures/la_river/" target="_blank">Departures</a> and it focuses on the people and places that make the neighborhoods of Los Angeles. For the last six weeks they have been working on Venice. Today they came to the Pacific Jewish Center Shul on the Beach to learn about us and to be included in their upcoming Venice piece.</p>
<p>It was a true honor and privilege to be a part of this worthwhile project. The production should be finished in February and I look forward to seeing that.</p>
<p>The camera crew shot some footage of our morning services and did two interviews.<span id="more-1649"></span> First, they interview Gary Dalin. Gary has been part of PJC since 1979 and provided great insight into the rich history of Pacific Jewish Center and the greater Venice Jewish community. He was eloquent and impressive in his interview and represented us very well. Great job Gary!</p>
<p>I was interviewed next. I hope I did okay. I myself have interviewed so many Jewish College student on camera and made those interviews into documentaries, so I know how hard it can be. (For two of my videos click <a href="http://werejustbetter.com/JAM/jam06.wmv">here for JAM 2006</a> and <a href="http://werejustbetter.com/JAM/Chase.mov" target="_blank">click here for Chase Edler</a>.) Among many topics, we talked about the juxtaposition of the historic quality of the Shul on the Beach to the future of outreach including this blog and my relative youth as a Rabbi. We also talked about the role the Shul plays in the boardwalk community, surrounded by the wild atmosphere of the boardwalk. It wasn&#8217;t too long, maybe a 35 minute interview in total, but we covered a lot of topics. Of course, there were some delinquents that felt the need to disturb us, that is just life on Venice Boardwalk&#8230;</p>
<p>I hope the final product reflects well on our special community and those who see it are inspired at least to check us out some time. I ended the interview with an open invitation to anyone who would like to see what we are all about and I extend that invitation to all of you reading this right now.</p>
<p>I also, want to thank Justin, Dan and Matt for including us in this project. I wish you much success in this endeavor and anything you do in the future.</p>
<p>Here are a couple pictures that Leslie Friedman took with her BlackBerry during the interview.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a Law Student, there are things I find interesting that may not interest &#8220;clients&#8221; (non-Lawyers, hehe). The following article interests me and will probably interest any lawyer or law student, anyone Jewish, or anyone that has been following the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073003563.html" target="_blank">Gates Saga</a>.</p>
<p>I invite you to contribute your opinion in the comments.</p>
<p>The article originally appeared in this week&#8217;s <a href="http://jewishpress.com" target="_blank">Jewish Press</a> as an OP-ED. The writer is Nathan Lewin (<a href="http://www.lewinlewin.com/nathan.html" target="_blank">read more about him here</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span id="more-922"></span><a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/40250" target="_blank">WHAT IF GATES WERE AN UNRENOWNED JEWISH BLACK WOMAN?</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nathan Lewin</strong></p>
<p>Posted Jul 29 2009</p>
<p><strong> </strong>Soon after Cambridge police arrested and handcuffed Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. on a disorderly conduct charge, they realized the black man they wanted to prosecute was a renowned academic. As a result, he was released and the charges against him were dropped.</p>
<p>The ensuing public debate &#8211; in which Cambridge authorities now try to justify arresting a man because he refused to comply in his own home with police directions and deny that race had any influence on how the police reacted &#8211; suggests that if an ordinary black homeowner, rather than a Harvard professor, had been arrested under these circumstances, the criminal charges would not have been dropped so readily.</p>
<p>Consider the pending case of Rivka &#8211; a black, very dark-skinned, extremely devout Orthodox Jewish woman. Rivka is employed in New York, spends <em>Shabbat </em>in Washington, and her work frequently takes her on extended trips overseas. Being single and in her mid-fifties, she rented a 3-bedroom apartment on the West Side of Manhattan, and advertised on Craigslist for female roommates willing to accept short subleases. All applicants were informed by Rivka that the apartment was strictly kosher. A special page prescribing the <em>kashrut </em>rules was added to the lease that each roommate signed.</p>
<p>The rules were followed by a series of women Rivka accepted as roommates. In July 2007, a white blond-haired girl named Brooke answered Rivka&#8217;s ad and signed a five-month lease with the <em>kashrut </em>provisions. Brooke promptly violated the <em>kashrut</em> rules and admitted, in sworn testimony, that she brought nonkosher food into the apartment in knowing violation of her signed agreement. Rivka told Brooke she would have to leave.</p>
<p>Having e-mailed Brooke that she had arranged, at her &#8211; Rivka&#8217;s &#8211; expense, for a hotel room where Brooke could stay while she was looking for other accommodations, and believing that Brooke had agreed to have her belongings transported to the other location, Rivka began moving Brooke&#8217;s clothing to the hotel. Brooke arrived at the apartment unexpectedly and called the local precinct, reporting, &#8220;My roommate is currently stealing stuff out of my room.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Rivka returned after depositing Brooke&#8217;s belongings in the reserved hotel room, she found two policemen at the apartment with Brooke. The senior police officer (who is white), testified that Rivka showed them the lease and the e-mail she had sent to Brooke, and explained that she had moved Brooke&#8217;s belongings to the nearby hotel because she had an agreement with Brooke to do so. Rivka insisted to the officers that she wanted Brooke out of the apartment. The officers testified that Rivka interrupted her conversation with them to spend ten minutes in prayer.</p>
<p>Rivka then left the officers and retreated to her bedroom and locked her door. The officers demanded that she come out. On her cell phone, Rivka called a friend from the Georgetown Synagogue in Washington who had a law degree but was not in private practice. He told her to ask the officers for a warrant and for their precincts and badge numbers. The white policeman said in his testimony that he &#8220;did not recall&#8221; whether he gave his precinct and badge number.</p>
<p>When Rivka did not emerge voluntarily from her bedroom, the sergeant called the Emergency Services Unit &#8211; the police department&#8217;s riot squad. They came in full force, with more than one dozen policemen. They broke down the door to Rivka&#8217;s bedroom, dragged her into the hall and up against the wall at gunpoint, handcuffed her, and then took her downstairs to a waiting ambulance.</p>
<p>The ambulance drove to a nearby hospital. One of the officers tried to have her committed to the psychiatric unit. After an examination, the hospital said there was no basis to admit her. The police then took Rivka to the police precinct, where she was permitted one phone call. She called a person she had befriended while regularly attending <em>Shabbat</em> services at the Georgetown Synagogue, but the arresting police officer hung up the telephone in the middle of Rivka&#8217;s call.</p>
<p>Rivka was then taken to another hospital, where she was handcuffed to a bed. Next morning, she was returned to the precinct. The rabbi at the New York synagogue she attends on weekdays heard of her plight and brought a kosher meal to the precinct &#8211; the first meal Rivka had since her arrest the day before.</p>
<p>Rivka was charged with &#8220;Obstruction of Governmental Administration in the Second Degree&#8221; and with &#8220;Unlawful Eviction.&#8221; The New York D.A.&#8217;s office refused to dismiss the charges even after all the facts were presented. The young prosecutor first demanded that Rivka plead guilty and perform community service and ultimately was willing to accept an unconditional &#8220;Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal.&#8221; Rivka refused to accept any terms other than outright dismissal because she insisted she had done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>The case went to a nonjury trial before a (white) judge who was a former prosecutor. He excluded much defense testimony as irrelevant and hearsay and rejected out of hand Rivka&#8217;s right to remain in her own bedroom after her discussion with the police. At the end of the trial, he found Rivka guilty on both counts and fined her $500. Rivka is appealing.</p>
<p>Would the police have broken the bedroom door of a white gentile and charged her with crimes after being called to a dispute between her and a roommate? Is this another instance &#8211; as the Gates arrest is said to be &#8211; of injustice against blacks, aggravated by Rivka&#8217;s Jewish identity?</p>
<p>Rivka is suing New York City, the policemen, and Brooke in federal court. The docket number of her case is 08 Civ. 10065. I am her lawyer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite gadget blogs ran a despicable headline for a post yesterday. Gizmodo is a great blog when it comes to getting information, reviews and opinions on the latest technology and gadgets. Unfortunately, yesterday they disgraced their reputation with a pretty offensive headline.</p>
<p>The headline garnered enough attention that they ultimately changed it to something less offensive.</p>
<p><span id="more-881"></span>There is a normal Orthodox Jewish couple who have a vacation home. Originally, the building did not have motion sensing lights but recently changed the system to a motion sensing system. On Shabbos the couple did not wish to be forced to walk in a hallway that would trigger the lights on. They requested the building swap the new system for the old one at their expense. The building refused. The couple sued.</p>
<p>Gizmodo posted the following headline: &#8220;Orthodox Couple Imprisoned By Superstition Blame Motion Sensing Light Instead&#8221;.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-876 aligncenter" title="giz superstition" src="http://i1.wp.com/rabbifink.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/giz-superstition.jpg?resize=426%2C200" alt="giz superstition" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Subsequently, the headline was changed to &#8220;<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5317968/orthodox-jewish-couple-sues-over-motion+sensing-light" target="_blank">Orthodox Jewish Couple Sues Over Motion Sensing Light</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink" target="_blank">I posted the link on Facebook </a>hoping to get some comments from my Facebook friends. I got a few interesting responses.</p>
<p>One commenter hit the two points that I want to discuss on this blog.</p>
<p>1 &#8211; The halachic ramifications of motion sensors and Shabbos for the Orthodox Jew.</p>
<p>2 &#8211; The reaction of a non-Jew to a halacha adherent Jew.</p>
<p>I do not want to get into a nitty gritty halachic discourse of motion sensors on Shabbos. Suffice to say, the issue is not black and white. On Shabbos one may not act in a way that will automatically produce a desired result that violates Shabbos. Completing a circuit to turn on a light is a violation of Shabbos. By activated the sensor, one automatically produced the desired result of turning on the light.</p>
<p>There is leeway when the result is not automatic or when the result is not desired.</p>
<p>I am all for striving to keep halacha. When I am met with a choice between what I want and what halacha demands I try my best to choose halacha. So for example, if I am driving late at night and I pull into a rest stop and they have a fast food joint serving burgers that are not kosher I have a choice. I want a burger but halacha demands that my burgers be kosher. I choose to leave the rest stop burgerless. I will not sue the restaurant for not providing kosher burgers. Right?</p>
<p>Now, I know this is a little different from the vacation home. But, it is the same principle. If halacha will not allow for me act a certain way, guess what? I am not going to act that way. Even if I really, really, really want to. So, I know that in the vacation home there are other factors, such as broken promises and flawed reasoning. However, if it were me, or anyone that I advise I would trade that place for a new one.</p>
<p>Adhering to halacha is about making a choice to allow halacha to control your life and not your whims and desires at any given moment. There will be times where the choice is hard or the alternative is very tempting, those are the times where you show your strength of character by making what you believe to be the right choice. Those are not the times to sue because you have been made uncomfortable in your adherence to halacha.</p>
<p>There may be great merit to the lawsuit. I find that all irrelevant. I think, avoiding a legal brouhaha over halacha is more important than the principle of who is right and who is wrong in this situation.</p>
<p>Second, the offensive headline that originally appeared on Gizmodo bothered me. I am NOT an overly sensitive person. I do not cry &#8220;Anti-Semitism at every opportunity I get (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/06/matza-in-the-ny-times-and-in-our-times/#more-440" target="_blank">ala Uncle Leo</a>). I don&#8217;t even call this &#8220;Anti-Semitism&#8221;, I call this insensitivity.</p>
<p>There is nothing against Jewish people, per se, when calling religion a superstition. But there is a tremendous breach of sensitivity.</p>
<p>Gizmodo writer, Jack Lofton doesn&#8217;t believe in religion in general and that&#8217;s okay. I am not going to call him names about his lack of faith or question his theology publicly. That is just not appropriate for a gadget blog. If he were writing on a religion blog, or even an anti-religion blog then Jack&#8217;s opinion about religion might be relevant. Here, it was not and inserting his bigoted opinion was insensitive.</p>
<p>I do not read the headline as an affront to Judaism or even religion in general. I read the headline as an affront to civility.</p>
<p>We live in a big world, with a lot of people. Not everyone is going to agree. You can try and convince everyone you are right or lash out against those who do not. But ultimately, we are not all going to agree. So let agree on this, let&#8217;s choose not to fight about our disagreements and otherwise be friends. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/19/atheists-and-believers-la-times-smackdown/" target="_blank">I mantioned this revolutionary concept on this blog a little while ago</a>. We have more in common than not. Let&#8217;s stop fighting about God, or anything else we feel strongly about and move on.</p>
<p>Also, Jack, Gizmodo is the wrong place to make your point about religion.</p>
<p>Time and place, Jack. Showing your prejudice against religion is ugly, it is especially ugly when it is not at all connected to the content of your post. I read Gizmodo for technology news and content. Just because you have a soapbox does not mean you can shout whatever you want whenever you want. Time and place.</p>
<p>Jack, please don&#8217;t make fun of other people&#8217;s beliefs on one of my favorite gadget blogs. Thanks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: To his credit, </em><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5317968/orthodox-jewish-couple-sues-over-motion+sensing-light" target="_blank"><em>the writer apologized.</em></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/24/boy-can-i-relate-to-this/" target="_blank">I blogged about my bond of kinship</a> with a pastor in Ocean City Maryland.</p>
<p>We both are clergy working on beaches with fickle crowds. Sometimes we are packed and sometimes we are not&#8230;</p>
<p>The post generated a bit of a response from some of our Community Members as well as some other blog readers. We had one commenter wonder if anyone reads this blog. (Yes, a lot of people do read this blog.)</p>
<p>We had another commenter offer to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=youngstown+PA&amp;daddr=505+Ocean+Front+Walk,+Venice,+CA+90291&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=%3BFf2xBgIdAijw-A&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=w&amp;sll=37.14831,-98.925965&amp;sspn=37.650893,65.390625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=37.09024,-98.964844&amp;spn=37.683309,65.390625&amp;z=4" target="_blank">walk from Youngstown PA</a>. (It takes 33 days by foot according to Google, click if you need directions.)</p>
<p>So, how did our Shavuos go?</p>
<p><span id="more-725"></span></p>
<p>It was amazing.</p>
<p>Shavuos began with a very nicely attended Erev Shavuos Mincha. The rule is that we count 49 complete days from the second day of Pesach until Shavuos. Therefore we need to wait until nightfall is certain to commence Shavuos Services.</p>
<p>To pass the time we studied the Book of Ruth. I gave an in depth overview of the story as well as some of the deeper insights into why we study the Book of Ruth on Shavuos.</p>
<p>The overall theme that I wished to convey was that the Jewish line of Kings comes from David, who comes from Ruth, who was a convert. Further, the Jewish Messiah will be from the Davidic line as well. This is a powerful take-home lesson.</p>
<p>We followed evening services with a tasty community meal. Then the action began.</p>
<p>Together, we studied a section of Talmud in depth. The topic was &#8220;Expression of Ownership&#8221; and the marathon 2 hour session &#8220;flew by&#8221;. I was peppered by great questions and all <strong><em>40</em></strong> attendees participated and enjoyed the learning.</p>
<p>The next morning we reconvened for morning services and were blessed with a robust Minyan. I spoke about the &#8220;Chosen People&#8221; and mentioned the <a href="https://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/jewish-genius-10855?page=all" target="_blank">famous Charles Murray essay in <em>Commentary Magazine</em> about that topic</a>. We were treated to a special dairy kiddush on the back patio. Mmmm cheesecake.</p>
<p>Friday night services were very well attended. We had a few guests in our shul, as is very common at PJC. One couple had been guests at one of our community member&#8217;s homes on Pesach for a Seder and they came to PJC for the first time for Friday night services. Of course, they were invited to a family for Friday night dinner and I heard that it went really well.</p>
<p>Another guest was a student of mine from a previous position I held at a different job. It was really cool that he came to our shul for services and we had a chance to catch up. He is now at Tufts in Boston and was part of their <a href="http://www.meor.org/meoroncampus/campuses/tufts.asp" target="_blank">Maimonodies Scholars (MEOR) program with Rabbi Loketch</a>, who grew up across the street from my wife in Monsey NY. (Small world.)</p>
<p>We had a guest speaker as well. Community member Erez Talmor spoke about what the Shema means to him. I introduced him by reminding the congregation that Torah study is not just for Rabbis and being a Torah scholar is something we all strive for. Erez is a great example of this and he did a great job.</p>
<p>Shabbos morning services were elongated due to several key additions. The congregation stuck it out and we concluded with a satisfying kiddush on the back patio.</p>
<p>Even Shabbos afternoon services were well attended. This is a trouble spot from time to time, but we had a wonderful minyan. Following services we had a small dinner. We were supposed to talk about the number 50 and why Shavuos has no set date in the Torah. Instead we had yet another discussion about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/clothes/" target="_blank">clothes and dress codes</a>. Riveting, as always.</p>
<p>Shavuos was a resounding success in Venice. The classes and services were well attended. We had our usual influx of strolling Jews who wandered into the shul off the boardwalk and the spiritual and physical warmth of our shul provided a wonderful Shavuos for everyone.</p>
<p>I guess I do not have so much <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/24/boy-can-i-relate-to-this/" target="_blank">in common with the Pastor in Ocean City MD</a> after all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had a spectacular Shabbos on the beach this week.</p>
<p>Friday Night Dinner was <a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Quakes/ci10373093.html" target="_blank">punctuated by a bang</a>. An earthquake struck the area and sent many of us <a href="http://sciencedude.freedomblogging.com/2008/07/31/should-you-duck-under-a-table-during-an-earthquake/" target="_blank">under the table</a> for cover! The earthquake however was no match for the Shabbos Lunch meal the next day&#8230;</p>
<p>For the first time anyone can remember all 3 observant <a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/" target="_blank">Shuls</a> in the <a href="http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/parsha/hollander/bio.htm" target="_blank">Venice</a> / <a href="http://www.yism.org/" target="_blank">Santa Monica</a> area shared a community meal together. The turnout was incredible, the atmosphere was electric and every participant truly enjoyed themselves.</p>
<p>Leslie Friedman (PJC Office), Mildred Wilson and my wife Tova planned and set up the whole thing and we appreciate their efforts.</p>
<p>It was truly a special moment in time and we are so happy with how the event turned out.</p>
<p>Pacific Jewish Center has an open door policy and this week we backed up our promises and ideas of an open door policy with actions. There will be more such events in the future and we look forward to more unity, harmony, peace and love across the Venice / Santa Monica Community. We share more than just a neighborhood, we share common values, goals and ideas. We can all be so much more effective if we work together.</p>
<p>In a couple of months PJC will also be hosting a <a href="http://www.shabbatacrossamerica20.org/" target="_blank">Shabbat Across America</a>. This is an opportunity for anyone who has not experienced a Shabbos with us in Venice to join us. There will be group meals and home hosted meals in the neighborhood and now is the time to begin inviting your friends and neighbors. The week will begin with a special Shabbos <a href="http://finkorswim.com/category/connections/" target="_blank">themed</a> &#8220;<a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php" target="_blank">Connections</a>&#8221; exploring the beauty and significance of Shabbos. So mark your calendars! March 16 will be the special Connections and March 20 -21 will be the Shabbat Across America Shabbos.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Thank you to community member Milton Simon for editing these Shabbos speeches given at the Pacific Jewish Center from my notes into <a href="http://finkorswim.com/category/shabbos-on-the-beach/" target="_blank">these</a> essays.</strong></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">Today we are going to talk about truth. We will also discuss the opposite of truth. What is the opposite of truth? Something is true when it is in accordance with the facts and reality. The opposite of truth is when something is not in accordance with the facts and reality. Let us keep these definitions in mind as we progress.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">As we jump back into the Parsha story we head to end of the Parsha. We have just experienced the most dramatic and moving section of all of Torah and perhaps in all of history. Yosef has revealed himself to his brothers. Yosef forgives his brothers. Yosef tells his brothers it was all part of a master plan and it is water under the bridge. The brothers are then invited to join Yosef and his family in Egypt to avoid the famine (and bring the fulfillment of the prophecy that the Jewish people would be slaves in Egypt.)</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">We can imagine the good spirits the brothers were in as they returned to their father in Israel. When they left him last they were on the verge of tragedy. One brother was in jail, the entire family was threatened and all this was aside from the gnawing guilt the brothers most certainly felt every day of their lives, imagining their lying to their father caused him massive suffering. They saw their father wither away and lose his spark due to their actions and lies. Now the brothers have their chance at redemption. They see that it was all part of a plan! They are forgiven! Yosef wants them to move to Egypt! We can only imagine their elation as they journeyed back to Yaakov their father.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The psukim tell us what happened when the brothers reached Yaakov. This should be another climactic scene. If we could imagine a movie about when the brothers tell Yaakov the news, the music would swell while the camera goes in real close to capture Yaakov’s unbridled joy. As Yaakov would hear the news the room would brighten, years of sadness would melt off Yaakov’s face as he would stand up from his seat and the scene would slowly fade to black. Well let’s see how it really happened. In fact, Yaakov didn’t believe them!!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">What? Yaakov did not believe his sons. Did he think they playing a practical joke on him? Couldn’t he see their genuine joy? How are we to understand this?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">Let us continue in the Chumash. Amazingly we see that eventually Yaakov believed that Yosef was alive. What convinced him? How did the truth become evident?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">R’ Schwab mentions the saying in Avos of R’ Shimon. “The punishment of the liar is that even when he tells the truth no one listens to him” and we see from the brothers of Yosef that when they lied to their father by telling him that Yosef was dead they were not believed when they tried to tell their father that Yosef was alive.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">At this point the Shevatim understood that by covering their misdeeds they would NEVER succeed, even with the truth. Therefore they realized their only option is to now tell Yaakov the entire story. They decided to tell their father all about their jealousy and plots to kill Yosef. The eventual sale of Yosef was discussed and they asked for forgiveness from Yaakov. That is what is meant by they told Yaakov ALL about Yosef – es Kol divrei Yosef. The full truth was finally revealed. At that point Yaakov was able to believe his sons and see the truth.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The truth is not only that the words are true. Truth is consistent with all the facts and reality. Truth does not exist in a vacuum – it is part of a greater whole. It must fit in with the song of the universe and be in perfect harmony with all the other parts. Yaakov was on too great a spiritual level to be a piece of the truth. He needed all of it to complete the circle of truth of reality.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The Talmud teaches us that Emes – truth stand on its own. And sheker – the opposite of truth always falls. We can visualize this by looking at the letters that form the word Emes and the letters that form the word Sheker. Emes is Aleph, Mem, Taf. These are the first, last and middle letters of the Aleph Beis. Truth is from start to finish with a solid middle. This is consistent with what we are saying that truth is part of a greater whole of reality and not independent. Perhaps even more interesting is the formation of each letter. The Aleph has two legs to stand on, the mem has a base on its bottom and the taf has a base as well as two legs. If we would stand these letters up they would not fall. Let’s look at Sheker. Shin, kuf and reish. Those letters all have but one leg and when stood up will topple. Further these letters are “out of alphabetical order” and are all right next to each other in the aleph beis. This indicates that sheker can work for a time because it is kept close and private but once the sheker gets out it cannot stand on its own.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">Our Torah world is predicated on Emes. The Torah is emes and stands on its own. We don’t need to make excuses for Torah and it stands the test of time.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The lesson of Yaakov in this week’s parsha is that sheker is hard to undo – we can’t just press control z and magically the sheker disappears. Sheker can stand for a little while but eventually it gets toppled. This is why we need to be so careful to always begin with the absolute emes. It can be very difficult to undo sheker as we saw with Yaakov.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">What was are witnessing in the world right now as Israel rains attacks upon its enemies is frightening. When the world is so immersed in sheker the truth is very hard to find. But the truth stands on its own and will eventually be seen. We need to do our part as advocates for Israel and prevent lies from spreading. I say this not because I am concerned with international opinion and political clout – rather I say this because when Jews look bad it reflects upon GD and it is very important to me to help prevent further Chillul Hashem. We can do our part as advocates for Israel.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">But why are these lies so easy to spread? Shouldn’t the truth be obvious?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;"><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The last point I want to make is that while we do 100% back our brothers and sisters in Israel we also recognize there is a flaw in their reality. The official line of the Government of Israel is not that Hashem put the land of Israel in our hands, they say WE DID IT OURSELVES. Is it any wonder the world disbelieves our stories about the war, or anything?</span></span><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;"> </span></span></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The world KNOWS the truth, and disbelieves us when we hold sheker. Amazing!</span></span><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;"> </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">Is our leadership in the land of Israel taking all of reality into the equation? Do they recognize the role that GD plays in their lives? So long as they do not have the complete truth, with all its realities and all its beauty – the world will not see that the truth is with us. As we saw with Yaakov – only the whole truth is recognized as the truth. The only time a truth is recognizable to all and stands on it own is when the truth is consistent and the truth is in sync with the realities of the universe. When the truth is part of the harmony of the world then everyone will see it. When our leadership in the land of Israel embraces the spiritual component to the land of Israel the tremendous amount of Torah that spouts from the land of Israel, when the message of truth is consistent with all the facts and realities – that GD gave us this land – he should have a say as to how we use it, when that message is clear – the truth will be unequivocal and unchallenged.</span></span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Thank you to community member Milton Simon for editing these Shabbos speeches given at the Pacific Jewish Center from my notes into these articles.</em></strong></p>
<p>The Torah tells us in this week’s parsha, “Vayeshev Yaakov b’eretz megurei aviv b’eretz Canaan” Yaakov and his entire family returned to the land of his parents – the land of Canaan. Yaakov has successfully survived the life-threatening conflict with Eisav after preserving his integrity after his father-in-law Lavan has tried to cheat and swindle him during his 20 years of labor.  Amazingly, Yaakov developed tremendous wealth despite all of Lavan’s best efforts.</p>
<p>One can imagine a very successful retiree going back to his roots to ride off into the sunset. Yaakov raised 13 children, he had 2 wives plus 2 quasi wives to keep happy. Yaakov has worked very hard to be able to now enjoy his last days basking in the glory of his life’s work. If it were us that is what we would do.</p>
<p>In fact Rashi brings the Medrash Rabba which states that when a Tzaddik has earned a lion’s share of riches in the “world to come” and they ALSO desire to live out their wealthy retirement days in peace and quiet before they die, the Satan (he is the prosecuting angel) complains. He says – “Is it not enough that the Tzaddik will live out his eternal life in Olam haba (afterlife) but he also wants to enjoy a tranquil existence in this world?”  The Satan’s complaint “forced” G-d to prove Satan’s complaint unfounded, and this is what happened with Yaakov – just as he is ready to relax the entire incident of Yosef’s kidnapping and sale into slavery occurs. Now Yaakov sits for many years in pain and anguish over his lost son.</p>
<p>Rav Schwab asks the obvious question on this Midrash. What power (why should G-d listen to him?) does the Satan have to stop a Tzaddik from living out his days in peace and tranquility? Leave the poor man alone! Especially when the man is a Yaakov Avinu and his plan is learn Torah day and night!</p>
<p>Avraham, Yaakov’s grandfather took it upon himself to spread the goodness of the Creator to the masses. Avraham made it his life’s mission to inform anyone and everyone that the world has a Master and He has an opinion about how we are to live our lives. Everything Avraham did reflected this mission. His “guest service” was a tool to introduce people to the idea of a single living and loving  G-d, and he was rather successful in this endeavor.</p>
<p>As the possuk in Lech Lecha says: Avraham built a mizbeyach (alter) and called out to G-d. Onkelos translates this calling out to G-d as prayer. Ramban disagrees. Ramban learns that the words mean what they say. Avraham literally called out the name G-d to the world. When he was in Ur Kasdim, Avraham was unable to influence anyone due to the prevailing idol worship culture and a dictator in Nimrod who killed all non-idol worshipers. But now Avraham was blessed with “V’avarech Avarechecha” he proclaimed G-d’s existence to the masses and his voice was heard. Ramban continues and says that G-d promised Avroham’s son, Yitzchak that He would be with him and Yitzchak also built a mizbeyach and called out to G-d. Yitzchak was keeping the family tradition alive by proclaiming G-d’s glory to all.  Ramban says that we don’t find this anywhere for Yaakov.</p>
<p>Yaakov took a subtler route. Yaakov had children. Yaakov produced a large family which he trained in the ways of G-d. By default they transmitted the message of their grandfather Yitzchak and their great grandfather Avraham to the world. And we continue this mission to this very day.</p>
<p>Rav Schwab adds that Yaakov did actually build mizbeyach but his calling out was personal. He named places with names that reflected a recognition of G-d but (what are you trying to say here?) his influence was certainly palpable. Yaakov wanted to influence the world through his family and this is what is meant by Yaakov seeking peace and tranquility at the end of his days.</p>
<p>On this there is a legitimate complaint the Satan could make. Yaakov should be spreading the word to everyone not just his family. He has limited his exposure to the masses and thereby limited the influence that he could have. This was unacceptable. Yaakov had the responsibility to carry on the tradition of his father and grandfather and bring the masses of people closer to G-d. This was the flaw in Yaakov’s plan.</p>
<p>And it is for this that Yaakov suffered at the hand of the sale of Yosef to Egypt. Yosef goes down to Mitzrayim (Egypt) and affects the masses of mankind, and the “old” Yaakov eventually follows and with 70 family members in tow.  They as a group are could have carried out a tremendous influence on the masses, but it was Yosef alone who took the lead.</p>
<p>Yaakov would no longer be able to sit back and raise his family in isolation and avoid the outside world. It fell to Yosef (and eventually his brothers) to influence the world around them. The message of the “fathers” was very clear, be a light to the world, do good and spread Torah and the ways of G-d.</p>
<p>When my great-grandfather Reb Elyah Lopian retired from his post in England as a Torah leader where he served as the Rosh Yeshiva in Etz Chaim he wished to emigrate to the land of Israel. He was 76 years old at the time. He was an accomplished Torah scholar. He had been Rosh Yeshiva at a number of yeshivas already. He had a very large family and desired to live out his days in Eretz Yisrael. He wanted to learn from the Torah of the great scholars of Israel and he looked forward to taking a secondary, less public role to focus on personal growth and Torah study. Reb Elyah was very reluctant to take public speaking roles as his goal was to remain out of the public eye while in the land of Israel.</p>
<p>Reb Elyah had an audience with the Chazon Ish who was the Gadol Hador (the leader of the Jewish religious world, d. 1954). The Chazon Ish asked him what he planned on doing in Israel, Reb Elyah explained that his desire was to learn and imbibe of the Torah of the gedolim (great sages) who were living there. He was convinced that at his age it would not be realistic to seek a position such as a mashgiach or spiritual mentor for teenagers. The Chazon Ish responded with a blessing from Tehillim in our Shir Shel Yom for Shabbos. Od yenuvun bseiva dsheinim veraananim yihyu, which means “they shall yield fruit in a ripe old age.</p>
<p>The mishna in Avos explains that seiva refers to the stage of life where man is in his seventies. The Chazon Ish then added, lehagid ki yashar Hashem, “to proclaim the righteousness of G-d” – yes, he said,  at your age you are to be a teacher. Reb Elyah heeded the advice of the Chazon Ish and became the mashgiach in Kfar Chassidim for the next 22 years! His hundreds of Talmidim are ever grateful to the Chazon Ish.</p>
<p>The story echoes of our parsha’s story. There is no rest for the Tzaddik. We can always make a difference.</p>
<p>I know that our community has already accomplished great things in outreach. I know of the many religious families that exist today only due to our influence. You can say confidently – “I did my fair share, it is time for me to take it easy.”   To that I say no! You are too great to take it easy. There are people in your neighborhood who are waiting to be invited by you, waiting for you to reach out to them. Bring them to our events. Bring them Monday night to the Chanuka party, bring them every Monday night, bring them to shul on Friday night, bring them to shul on Shabbos morning. Bring them over to me. Let me make a connection with them and give them another reason to come back in all senses of the word.</p>
<p>Together we can do it. We have done it in the past and it is time to get back in the game. We have a variety of opportunities for our neighbors to learn more – let’s reach out to them and give them those opportunities. There is so much energy here ready to be unleashed. We have the infrastructure in place what we need now is the raw material. Don’t ride off into the sunset. Bring Torah to your community by bringing them to the Torah and love for Torah and love for our fellow Jews that we offer at the Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>We can make lay claim to the title Pacific Jewish CENTER – the center for Jewish life in Venice. But only if we make it into a “center” by doing the outreach we are capable of doing.</p>

<p>On a gadget blog commentors get a full on education about Shabbos!</p>
<p>It is incredible how many people know about Shabbos and now have a grasp of some of the concepts. Eventually we are going to do a Shabbos Connections with community wide Shabbos participation and invitations. Until then I guarantee if you want a Shabbos meal just stop in the Shul on the Beach during services. You will be invited by someone!</p>
