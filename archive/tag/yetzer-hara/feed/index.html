<h2>Parshas Vayeshev<br />
Barasy Yetzer Hara, Barasy Torah Tavlin</h2>
<p>One of the many interesting story lines of Yosef Hatzadik’s experience of Parshas Vayeshev deals with his life as the chief of staff of Potifar. Yosef is appointed to be in charge of all of Potifar’s affairs and then we are told that Yosef was <em>yifei toar v’fei mareh</em>. The very next pasuk (39:7) tells us that all of the sudden the wife of Potifar set her sight to prey upon Yosef and place before him the ultimate test of his morality. Rashi presents the words of Chazal that teaches us that since Yosef was left in charge of Potifar’s estate he let it get to his head. He began to eat and drink and became preoccupied with his appearance. Thus, Hashem sent <em>eishes</em> Potifar to test him and remind him not to be haughty. Indeed soon there after, Yosef ended up back in prison.</p>
<p>The Netziv adds a vital insight to this lesson.<span id="more-4946"></span> The Natziv explains that typically a ben Torah can expect that the Torah will provide them some level of spiritual protection from the elements around them. The Torah, in telling us that Yosef was <em>yefei toa</em>r and <em>yfei mareh</em> is letting us know that the reason the Torah did not protect Yosef was because he wasn’t studying it enough. He wasn’t learning and as such there was no strength of Torah to protect him from nisayon. This lesson is critical.</p>
<p>Society at large can place many <em>nisyonos</em> from issues of morality, financial integrity, arrogance and pride. The Torah will only serve as a shield and protect us if we study it with intensity, consistency, passion and fervor. Baruch Hashem Yosef was able to pass the test, and as we learn later he went back to his learning. Those who don’t have Yosef’s strength of character should be reminded should be reminded to not get distracted in the priority of<em> talmid Torah kineged kulam</em>, whether at work and even in the bais medresh. Not only is the Torah the <em>tavlin</em> but it is the force field of protection which helps keep us safe from harm.</p>
