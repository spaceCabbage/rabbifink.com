				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When things are too difficult to comprehend, we have a tendency to focus our attention on a smaller detail that is part of the story. The Baltimore riots and their social environment are incomprehensible to many people. But within the broader story are mini-stories that we do understand. To me, the anecdote that has become the distraction from the Baltimore riots is the story of how one mom, Tory Graham, saw her son joining the rioters so she ran out to pull him away. As she pulled her son away from the mob, a camera captured her passionately yelling at him and striking him with her hands on his upper body and his head.</p>
<p>The public and the media fell in love with her and her story. It wasn&#8217;t long before she was being called #momoftheyear for pulling her son away from the rioters.<span id="more-9212"></span></p>
<p>When #momoftheyear was first being reported, I think it was mostly to great praise. People were proud that she &#8220;saved&#8221; her son from joining the mob. He was about to do something he might regret and she prevented it. That&#8217;s heroic.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/04/30/lessons-we-can-learn-from-momoftheyear/unnamed-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-9213"><img class="alignright wp-image-9213 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=506%2C257" alt="unnamed-3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Later, I heard some more thoughtful and complex ideas in the media and on social media. &#8220;If she was a good mom he wouldn&#8217;t have joined&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/04/30/baltimore-mother-toya-graham-hero/80sxXZEBSwz156H8GfLXMI/story.html">it&#8217;s terrible parenting to beat your child</a>&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/04/29/why-is-america-celebrating-the-beating-of-a-black-child/">white people only cheer a black mom if she is beating someone</a>.&#8221; There is certainly at least a dash of merit to all these points.  Some are more meritorious than others, but these analyses are far more introspective and insightful than anointing someone #momoftheyear based on a 30 second video.</p>
<p>I think something a little deeper is happening here too. Stories usually operate on multiple planes. One plane of a story includes every possible context that may have a connection to the story. It can go back to the beginning of time and include every event in history. Another plane looks at a story with limited context. Only the super relevant stuff is part of the story.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another plane that ignores all context to an event and includes just the event as it was seen. Clearly, this is unfair to the people in any story because it&#8217;s far too easy to misunderstand or misinterpret events with no context. If I see someone push another person, they are a bad person. When I see the car speeding into the person who got pushed, the pusher becomes a good person. Despite the inherent lack of truthiness to an event without any context, it has independent value as a &#8220;moment.&#8221; The truth of a &#8220;moment&#8221; is not important. A moment can arouse feelings or explain something or ask questions. It exists on a plane that does not operate within the true / false paradigm. It&#8217;s art.</p>
<p>As a &#8220;moment,&#8221; #momoftheyear was powerful, moving, and visceral. It made us feel something, maybe it was a parental connection to the Baltimore riots, and the thing we felt was good. There&#8217;s value in paying attention to the &#8220;moments&#8221; that move us and the things they make us feel. This also might explain our celebration of #momoftheyear and elevating her to hero status. We may have translated the good feelings of that &#8220;moment&#8221; into a modern fête of #momoftheyear.</p>
<p>But as a parenting story, a mom story, I don&#8217;t think it makes an ounce of sense to consider this mom a hero for anything beyond that &#8220;moment.&#8221; We know that it&#8217;s definitely wrong to beat your kids. We have no idea if she is a good mom in general or if her parenting was a factor in her son&#8217;s potential involvement. We also know that black people being beaten by authority is a significant social issue, especially in Baltimore. Therefore, the ensuing discussions of these issues in the context of #momoftheyear are useless at best and juvenile at worst.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s worth deescalating the rhetoric about #momoftheyear (or #worstmomever, if you see it that way) as a person or parent and instead we should focus on what this &#8220;moment&#8221; has brought to the consciousness of our culture. To me, the #momoftheyear &#8220;moment&#8221; was powerful on its own, but it carries with it some very important conversations about more general issues. The conversations have played out in the media and social networks, digital and non-digital. I&#8217;ve been reading and hearing a lot of opinions. Some have been great. Others have been disturbing.</p>
<p>I am appalled by people who still believe it is okay to beat children or teens. The mere thought brings me to tears. Education through fear is a nearsighted and selfish way to parent. Fear does not teach lessons or values. It teaches fear. The worst kind of fear based education is corporal punishment. Inflicting pain on anyone makes me extremely uncomfortable. It must be absolutely necessary to cause pain to another before crossing that line. It is never necessary for a parent to strike a child. Most of the time, hitting children is a way for a parent to vent or find an easy &#8220;solution&#8221; to a challenging problem. It&#8217;s actually pathetic. I cry when I think about children being hit by adults. If you hit your kids, please stop. If you don&#8217;t stop, please stop telling people how great it is to hit your kids.</p>
<p>I am appalled by people who think that a wayward child or teen is a reflection of the parents or their parenting. This is always true, but it is especially true when the waywardness is religious waywardness The best parents in the world have children who stray or act immorally. Children are people too. Ever person has their own struggles and there are no magical ways to parent out of every issue. Further, we don&#8217;t always know what a good parent does or what good parenting looks like. When it comes to religious choices, sometimes the best choices for that person are not religious choices. We will never have enough information to make that judgment about others. Stop making that judgment.</p>
<p>I am appalled by people who think they can make wholesale judgments about people based on a tiny slice of a person&#8217;s life. We have to learn how to give less value to the small sliver we see of people&#8217;s lives in short video clips. The world is changing and our worst moments are going to be playing on phones and larger screens. We can&#8217;t prevent that. But we can determine what we think when we see tiny slices of people&#8217;s lives. My opinion is that we should try to undervalue those &#8220;moments.&#8221; They lack context and cannot be trusted to tell a complete story. They should be treated that way.</p>
<p>If #momoftheyear inspires us to improve in these three areas, maybe she will truly earn her honorific. Perhaps more importantly, we should refocus our collective attention on the more systemic failures that have been exposed by the unrest in Baltimore. Let&#8217;s not forget, that&#8217;s the real story here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The devastating news reverberates throughout the Jewish world. Our worst fears have been confirmed. We won&#8217;t be able to #bringbackourboys. It&#8217;s over. And for now, we mourn.</p>
<p>But many of us are struggling to unravel the Gordian Knot of emotions, religious meaning, spiritual devotion, time, effort, energy we&#8217;ve put into these last few weeks. For those of us who are parents of children who have been aware of the ordeal, many of us are wondering what we tell our children? But all of us are also wondering, what do we tell ourselves?!<span id="more-8591"></span></p>
<p>Perhaps the wisest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard about tragedy was something Fred Rogers quoted from his mother. He said that his mother would comfort him during challenging times with a pithy thought.<strong><em> &#8220;Look for the helpers.&#8221;</em></strong> So simple and so sublime.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/06/30/tell-children/bnlfreoimaadt5v-jpg-large/" rel="attachment wp-att-8592"><img class="alignright wp-image-8592 size-medium" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BnlFreOIMAAdt5V.jpg-large.jpeg?resize=600%2C445" alt="BnlFreOIMAAdt5V.jpg-large" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>For every wicked person in the world wreaking havoc and destroying lives, there are many more good people in the world who are helping others and fixing the things that were broken by the evil people. Our minds focus on the outliers and the ones who make the most noise. But for every person doing the wrong thing, there are more people doing the right thing. We should not allow the pain to dominate us so completely that we forget that there is enough light in the world to outweigh the darkness.</p>
<p>Most of all, we can all be one of the helpers. Say something nice. Do something kind. Find empathy. Spread love.</p>
<p>Children need to be reminded of this even more than adults. If they know that something sad has happened because of bad people, remind your children to look for the helpers.</p>
<p>The emotions of a child are likely to be their primary concern. Most kids aren&#8217;t as worried about theology as adults. Adults have tougher questions and life experiences that demand a response. Here&#8217;s what I say today: <em>(For children who do worry about this kind of thing, I think the following would be just as applicable.)</em></p>
<p>For believers, there is a real struggle between belief and doubt. When we pray, we are hopeful and optimistic, and we want to believe. When we are crushed and depressed, we experience doubt. The human mind seeks to make peace between these two warring factions. We want to be certain about our beliefs and if we aren&#8217;t certain that our beliefs are true, our mind&#8217;s next option is to be certain that our beliefs are false. The last resort, and option that is to avoided at all costs, is the grey area in the middle. That place where our doubt and our yearning for certainty are at loggerheads. We don&#8217;t want to be in that place.</p>
<p>Yet, that is where life happens. The place of contradiction and confusion is where all the action is. We want to reject it so badly and be certain of everything being true on one side or if not, everything is a lie, for sure. But it just isn&#8217;t that way at all and we need to embrace that. We are not going to understand everything. It&#8217;s a limitation of being a physical being with limited resources. We can&#8217;t really be certain of anything which means that the best we can do is to expect a clash of feelings and thoughts.</p>
<p>What do we do with these conflicting ideas rattling in our brain? What do we do when our heart says one thing and our mind says another? What do we do when we want to be mad at God but we also want God to make it all better? Indeed, what do we do?</p>
<p>I think what we do is we learn to live in that struggle. We look at this challenge as an opportunity to make ourselves better, more complete, more complex, more nuanced. In whatever way we can grow or improve, we are using the struggle for good. It&#8217;s not that we ignore the questions, God forbid. No. We articulate our questions, we get mad, we feel the pain, and then we dive right into those emotions and swim to the other side. In the other side we articulate our faith, in God and in people and in ourselves, we find reasons for hope and excuses to love, and then we dive right back into the battle zone and struggle with our feelings.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy. It doesn&#8217;t simplify things. But while there is an elegance to simplicity, the most beautiful things are truly the most complex and intricate. These struggles enable us to weave a delicate tapestry that expresses our most basic human emotions. It won&#8217;t magically make us feel happy again. But in my view, we don&#8217;t try to feel better as much as we just try to feel. Feel all the feelings, live on this precipitous cliff, embrace the struggle, and when we emerge from the fray we will have found something new in ourselves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just like so many of you, I was distraught over the last few days as we hoped and prayed that Caleb Jacoby be found safe and unharmed. Thankfully, Caleb was returned to his family unscathed, at least physically. It shouldn&#8217;t matter, but because of my personal relationship with Caleb&#8217;s father (I spent some time with Caleb too) and my very close friendship with Caleb&#8217;s aunt, I felt very connected to this saga. Learning that he was found brought me to tears, in public, and I was so relieved that the most difficult part of the ordeal seemed to be over.</p>
<p>The <strong>first</strong> thing I want to say is that every parent out there had to have been at their wits end concerned for Caleb&#8217;s wellbeing. We all love our children very much. But like so many things, we sometimes take our children for granted. We sometimes forget to give them the love that we want to give them. We sometimes are distracted when we are spending time with our children and we miss out on quality time together. That&#8217;s time we will never get back. But seeing Jeff and his wife Laura, in my mind&#8217;s eye frantic and nervous and scared that they might never see their beloved son ever again, reminded me to give my children a little more than I might have given them otherwise. Reminders like this are terrible but we might as well listen to our messages.<span id="more-8033"></span></p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t squander your opportunity to be a parent. As I wrote on Facebook when I heard the good news that Caleb was okay, hug your children a couple extra times today. Maybe tomorrow too. And the next day. When we empathize with others who are unable to do what we can do, it can motivate us to be more forthcoming in our efforts. Give your children some extra affection. Go for it. They deserve it. I am sure of it. Do it for all the parents out there who wish they could give their child a hug but they can&#8217;t because they are estranged, or the child tragically passed away, or their children are simply grown and it&#8217;s too late for gratuitous hugs.<a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lost-Found-Logo-Color-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8034" alt="Lost &amp; Found Logo Color 2" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lost-Found-Logo-Color-2.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Next</strong> I&#8217;d like to point out what has become standard operating procedure for this sort of ordeal can not in any way be sufficiently lauded. It&#8217;s truly remarkable that people who never met Caleb or his family were spending their time and energy searching for him. There are volunteers and do-gooders in all communities, but there is something special about the way we band together in times like these. It&#8217;s normal for local people and people with a special interest in something to pitch in and help out in any given situation or tragedy. What makes the Jewish community&#8217;s response so remarkable is that it transcends time and space.</p>
<p>Jewish people, and perhaps especially Orthodox Jews, who are from distant places will put their lives on hold to give a hand to their fellow Jew. People from completely different social and religious circles will participate in the efforts. There is something that unites all the Jewish people. It&#8217;s not just a cliché or a platitude. And it&#8217;s not only in times of tragedy or pain. We are quite literally a family and family puts everything on hold to help family. It was on display as this story unfolded just as it was so many times in years and decades past. Searching for Bais Yaakov girls in the woods, looking for Leiby Kletzky, converging on Sea Gate after Hurricane Sandy, and most recently as we tried to track down Caleb, our people have a way of pulling together and uniting to help one another. We loathe these opportunities, but we know how to rise up to the occasion. It&#8217;s impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong>, and this is the most important thing I have to say, let&#8217;s be careful about what we say in the coming days and weeks about this incident. It was quite dramatic and we saw an outpouring of willing volunteers. That made the story quite public. But at this point, the public part of the tale has come to a close. The rest of the story is private.</p>
<p>After suffering through a few days of agony, let&#8217;s not spoil the euphoric reunion with innuendo and speculation. More than a few people have offered their armchair psychological analysis and others have demanded a full report to the public. One person even asked me if the public has a right to hear the story because they prayed and volunteered their time in the search. I find this abhorrent. It&#8217;s not just nosy, it&#8217;s disrespectful. And I think it&#8217;s a symptom of a very base desire. One that we ought to reign in as best we can.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret. We love gossip. We love juicy details and nuggets of inside information. My father used to say that the idol of the late 20th century was the Fox, as in 20th Century Fox. We loved television and movies. But now we love gossip even more. Our idols are Perez Hilton and TMZ. We just need to know. And when we don&#8217;t know, we just throw out wild guesses. People might try to disguise their curiosity in moral terms or altruistic intentions. But really, it&#8217;s just plain gossip.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty much always wrong. Judaism famously places great importance on privacy. But I think this is a unique scenario that requires even more sensitivity than usual. Here we are dealing with a child. Yes, sixteen years old is still a child. And when we are dealing with children we cannot drag them into the public eye. It was an emergency situation that called us to action. But once the emergency is over, our license for information is rescinded. Not only are we dealing with a child, but we are dealing with a father who is very much in the public sphere. Not only that, but this sort of incident lends itself to speculation because so much is almost certainly going to be left unsaid.</p>
<p>Please give the family the space that they need to heal from this ordeal. Do not speculate. Do not make accusations. Do not make demands for information. Just wish the family well and go back to your lives.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of the Internet age is defining boundaries. People share more of their lives with more people than ever before. It could be great. It could be fun. It could be meaningful. It could be a blessing. But don&#8217;t confuse voluntary sharing of information with gossip and telling tales.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been quite the roller coaster week in the Orthodox Jewish community. Some things have divided us. Other things have united us. Let&#8217;s always remember that even when we disagree, we are brothers and sisters who, when all is said and done, go back to the same home and love each other despite any differences we may have. It&#8217;s not lost on me that immediately following an event that generated vitriolic and hysterical (not the funny kind of hysterical) opinions between Jews, we&#8217;ve come together with the Jacoby family.</p>
<p>Of all the Torah portions, Beshalach is the most intense roller coaster ride of a parsha. We escape Egypt to safety, the Egyptians pursue us and we are trapped by the sea, the sea opens for us and we march forward, the Egyptians follow us and we can only assume they will catch us, the water crashes behind us and drowns the Egyptians thereby saving us, we sing a song of thanks, then we are thirsty, we are given water, then we are hungry, we are fed, then we want meat, we are given meat, we are given the gift of Shabbos, it is violated immediately, we were thirsty again, God gives Moses a secret well, Moses sins and is punished, then we are attacked by Amalek in a microcosm of the entire sedra, we can&#8217;t seem to stave them off, Moses lifts his hands and we start to win, then Moses gets tired and we start to lose, Joshua and Chur support Moses so he can lift his hands and we are able to defeat Amalek. Safety and danger. Safety and danger. Safety and danger. Safety and danger. Safety and danger. Time and again. Beshalach is a roller coaster ride and this week was also a roller coaster ride.</p>
<p>The Beshalach coaster ends positively and portends the revelation at Sinai. A good ending to a frenetic story. Let us hope and pray that we learn and grow from the peaks and valleys of the parsha and our communal life. Even more, let us be forge ahead to a new week and anticipate better tidings in the coming days and weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent article in Mishpacha Magazine, Rabbi Moshe Grylack reports parts of a conversation he had with a rabbi in Israel who works with people who left Orthodox Judaism. The article is pretty good and makes several salient points. There was one particular section of the article that received the most attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some rabbanim came to Rav Steinman in protest of the Nachal Haredi army unit for young men already off the derech (sic) and on the streets. Rav Shteinman asked one rav if he&#8217;d been approached by any of the fathers asking to daven that their son should die. &#8220;This week,&#8221; said Rav Steinman, &#8220;15 fathers came to me with this request.&#8221;<span id="more-7988"></span></p>
<p>The context here is that the children of these haredi parents are in the army. It&#8217;s not that they are praying for their death on the streets. They are praying for them to die in war. It&#8217;s not better, it&#8217;s just more accurate. [<strong>EDIT</strong>: I think the context may be a tad different thanks to a reader. It could also be that he was trying to defend Nachal Haredi by demonstrating how many Charedi kids are in need of something other than full time learning so he said that there are too many failing kids whose parents are praying for them to die.] Also these are haredim in Israel, where everything is much more extreme. I wouldn&#8217;t say that we could extrapolate anything about American haredim or even non-haredim in America from this story.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7989" alt="3906865381" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3906865381.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Needless to say, Rav Steinman would never pray for such a thing.</p>
<p>However, in a previous issue of Mishpacha, the discussion was about parents wishing their children on the street were dead. That may not have been the story in this recent article, but it&#8217;s been a story before.</p>
<p>My great-uncle Ronnie Greenwald wrote an article asking parents not to wish their kids dead and some angry parents wrote angry responses to him. Two of his sons, well regarded education experts in their own right, wrote responses to the angry parents defending their father&#8217;s position.</p>
<p>It seems too crazy to be believed. Parents were upset that they were being told not to hope their children die! I was flabbergasted when I heard this so I did some amateur research. I talked to a few parents in similar situations or to people who knew parents in similar situations. What I found tempered my anger a tiny bit.</p>
<p>Some of the parents who &#8220;hoped their children would just die&#8221; were not parents of children living in Tel Aviv with a job and a family. Their children were drug addicted teens living on violent streets. They lived in constant fear of losing their child to a horrible street death. They went to sleep every night wondering what kind of destructive behavior their beloved child was involved in that night. The constant worry, the constant fear took its toll and eventually they just felt that it would so much easier if the end all their pain could just stop.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to excuse this kind of thinking by parents. I think it&#8217;s wrong and I think it&#8217;s terrible. But I think it&#8217;s easier to relate to this kind of thinking.</p>
<p>Sure, there are far too many people out there who think that if their child is not as frum as they are then their life is not worth living. I know too many people like this too. But for many others, worrying about their child&#8217;s safety becomes overwhelming. I don&#8217;t excuse these people, but it&#8217;s worth understanding their plight. And it&#8217;s worth realizing that it&#8217;s not because of the religious observance of their children that death seems like a reasonable request.</p>
<p>But what of the rest? What of the parents who will never speak to their children who are no longer Orthodox? What of the parents that sit shiva for those children who leave Orthodox Judaism? What about the parents who hope their children die fighting for their country simply because they are not living an Orthodox life?</p>
<p>This must become a mantra for all of us:</p>
<p><strong>Do not allow the relationship with your children be dependent on religious observance.</strong></p>
<p>Say it. Say it out loud. Say it out loud every day.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we are parents. Our responsibilities to our children goes far beyond religious practice and observance. Please do not make parenthood about creating Orthodox Jews. That&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s about at all.</p>
<p>Next, we need to provide our children with the skills necessary to make it in a world without the frum safety net. A kollel guy can survive without a high school diploma. He can survive without knowing English. He can survive without knowing American customs and secular etiquette. But the one&#8217;s who leave cannot. We are setting up our children for failure if we do not provide them with the skills that real people need in the outside world.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, we need to work on our mental health awareness. This is not to imply that people who leave Orthodox Judaism are mentally ill. I just mean that when people are going through tough times, there are professionals who can help them deal with the trauma or issues they are working through. Skepticism of psychology and psychiatry are likely to transfer over to children who might actually need the help. This reticence towards professionals can influence those in need to turn to self medication instead. Much of that heartache could likely be avoided with professional help.</p>
<p>Third, we cannot continue to imply that everything outside Orthodox Judaism is drugs, promiscuity, and danger. Too much of our education system is based on teaching our children that the world outside is so terrible and disgusting that their only safe haven is within the frum community. This has at least two negative consequences. To some people all that debauchery sounds like fun! We are creating desire to leave by making the outside sound so free and attractive. At the same time we are making our own lifestyle seems like some sort of protection from all the bad things in the world. This is also a lie. Our frum world has just about everything you can find on the outside. We have promiscuity, we have drugs, we have abuse, we have crime, we have hate. We have it all. Such an obvious lie is bound to be discovered.</p>
<p>The other negative consequence is that it reinforces the idea that one who leaves is doomed to become part of the filth on the outside. It creates a paranoia in parents that results in them thinking that death would be preferable.</p>
<p>Next, we really need to increase opportunities for those who are on their way out or that are struggling with observance to acquire life skills. There are a lot of places that do this already. My sense is that these places are mostly high school replacements. But the truth is that a lot of people need help as adults too. Footsteps does a lot of this work. But there is no reason they should have a monopoly on this demographic.</p>
<p>Finally, I think we need to increase communication and cooperation with the non-Orthodox Jewish world. But not for kiruv purposes. Just for the sake of friendship. This would help in a bunch of ways. First, it would serve as a soft landing spot for some people who don&#8217;t want to be Orthodox but do want to be Jewishly engaged. Second, it would remind us that there are good, healthy, successful people outside Orthodox Judaism. This will undermine the irrational fear that one who leaves Orthodox Judaism is doomed to live a destructive life. And for some people, just knowing diverse people and not feeling suffocated can actually head off the feelings that lead one to leave Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The truth is that there is a lot of pain when people leave Orthodox Judaism. Nothing will ever make it pain free. We don&#8217;t have an obligation to make it just as easy to leave as it is to stay. But we do have an obligation to love and care for our children no matter what their choices might be. We have an obligation to teach our children a trade and path to a successful life on the inside or the outside. We also have an obligation to tell our children the truth. Whether it&#8217;s the truth about the outside world or mental health. We might even have an obligation to figure out a way to make space for a wider spectrum of Jewish observance in our communities. It certainly would be a good idea.</p>
<p>People will always be leaving communities in which they grew up. Let&#8217;s not pretend it never happens or that it can be stopped. Instead, let&#8217;s give all our children the love they need and help them be as successful as possible no matter their religious choices.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last summer, The Jewish Action featured a panel of experts answering the &#8220;tough questions.&#8221; One of the panelists was the great Rabbi Lawrence (Leib) Kelemen of Neve and Mussar Vaad fame. The question he was asked was: &#8220;Why are so many kids off the Derech?&#8221; (That&#8217;s their term. I don&#8217;t use it.)</p>
<p>Rabbi Kelemen starts off great. He says that kids don&#8217;t leave Orthodox Judaism because of a cell phone or the Internet or even because they never experience the beauty of Shabbos. He even says that secular courses at college are not the problem.<span id="more-7890"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10142436.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7891" alt="10142436" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/10142436.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Then he cites the research of the two foremost Orthodox therapists who deal with these issues in a paper published 15 years ago:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;First, there are child risk factors, such as attention deficit disorder (ADD), hyperactivity, oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), learning disabilities, poor academic abilities, poor social skills and depression. Second, there are environmental risk factors, which include major medical or economic crises, corrupt rabbis and teachers, sexual abuse, physical abuse, lack of recognition of individual strengths and Internet abuse. Third, there are family risk factors, which include hypercritical or angry home environments, parents with poor parenting skills and lack of shalom bayis.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>But Rabbi Kelemen says that the only real cause in this list compiled by professionals in the field, is the home. Forget the first two reasons mentioned in the paper. Basically, the real problem is bad parenting. He calls it parental selfishness.</p>
<p>He then discusses some other very important points and critiques of frum culture including: The emotional cost of being a frum Jew, teaching Mitzvos without appreciation for Mitzvos, the Shidduch system meat market, and overall misplaced values. These are all excellent points.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I didn&#8217;t love how Rabbi Kelemen latched on to one particular reason for kids leaving Orthodox Judaism and in essence blaming the parents, it was a pretty decent article. Made some good points, fell a little flat in others.</p>
<p>Apparently, not everyone saw it this way. It seems an avalanche of letters arrived in The Jewish Action mailboxes criticizing Rabbi Kelemen&#8217;s take on the issue. They sensed that Rabbi Kelemen was being too hard on parents of children who had left Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Rabbi Kelemen responds in the current Winter 2013 issue of The Jewish Action. He basically doubles down on his theory, and not only that, he expresses regret that he left wiggle room for anyone to think that the parents did not cause the child to leave Orthodox Judaism. In fairness, a letter from a third professional (this is in addition to the two cited in the 2013 article) lends some support to his theory that the parents are to blame, but the context of the letter was to answer a specific question, not to address the general issue.</p>
<p>He also cites R&#8217; Chaim Kanievsky who says that if the parents fought in the home then the children cannot be blamed for rebelling. This too, does not address the issue head on, it simply exculpates children from difficult homes from Heavenly Justice. Finally, he quotes R&#8217; Chaim Pinchas Scheinberg who said that almost every child who is struggling with their religion is seeking attention they could not get at home from their bad parents.</p>
<p>This response disturbs me.</p>
<p>First of all, I respect R&#8217; Chaim Kanievsky, but I don&#8217;t think he is in a position to offer specific advice on this specific issue. I could be wrong, but I do not think that he has experience with formerly Orthodox Jews in any meaningful sense. I simply have never heard of him being involved with these kids. Other Gedolim have such experience. I don&#8217;t believe R&#8217; Chaim is one of them. So while his thoughts are interesting and worth hearing, I don&#8217;t see how his oblique statement should be taken more seriously than experts in the field. The same goes for R&#8217; Scheinberg.</p>
<p>Second of all, I don&#8217;t like the assumption that there is a common or specific reason that people leave Orthodox Judaism which implies that without some sort of trauma or disability they would not leave. People leave for tons of reasons. And many people leave for intellectual or social reasons despite charmed childhoods. It&#8217;s arrogant to think we can turn every born Orthodox Jew into an adult Orthodox Jew. It just doesn&#8217;t work for some people. We have to acknowledge that possibility in any discussion of the topic.</p>
<p>Third of all, because there are completely healthy people who leave Orthodox Judaism, it&#8217;s obvious that not all of them are scarred by bad parenting. Most children of bad parents actually don&#8217;t leave Orthodox Judaism. Conversely, we all know excellent parents who have children who left Orthodox Judaism. The blame game here is silly and tired.</p>
<p>I remember when the Jewish Observer article on this phenomenon was released in the 90&#8217;s. The parents blamed the schools, the schools blamed the parents, the professionals blamed mental health issues, and the teens didn&#8217;t blame anything. I heard from rabbis who attended the Nefesh conferences in those days that the sessions were basically arguing over who was to blame.</p>
<p>Has it never occurred to people that not everyone is going to be frum? Has it ever occurred to people that some people just don&#8217;t get anything from Orthodox Judaism. Yesterday, I wrote about an heir to a Chasidic dynasty that did not feel comfortable in his religious environment. If not for an external factor, he may have left Orthodox Judaism too. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/26/book-review-untold-tales-of-the-hasidim/">Book Review | Untold Tales of the Hasidim</a>). The author of that book <a href="http://unpious.com/2012/05/interview-with-professor-david-assaf/" target="_blank">said in an interview</a> that he was raised Orthodox, but just never felt or believed in God so he stopped practicing. It&#8217;s not always something other than that! I recently talked with a young man who left Orthodox Judaism about his journey. I asked him when he felt like he was no longer Orthodox. He told me that he never actually felt Orthodox. Throughout his years of school he kind of just breezed right through it and knew in his head that when high school yeshiva was over, he was going to leave. No trauma, no mental illness, no story. Just left. He&#8217;s not the only one.</p>
<p>When the question of &#8220;Why are so many kids off the Derech?&#8221; is asked, the only proper response in my opinion, is to say that each kid has their own reason and each kid has their own story and each kid has their own choice to stay or to go.</p>
<p>People would like to identify trends so that fewer born Orthodox Jews leave. If the reasons for their flight are understood, the thinking is that the community can reform its behavior and as a result more people will stay Orthodox. Unfortunately, this is a game of whack-a-mole. There are too many reasons and too many factors to effectively keep everyone in the fold.</p>
<p>However, there is something that can be universally implemented. Many teens or young adults experiment with a life outside the confines of Orthodox Judaism. Some people call these kids &#8220;at-risk&#8221;. How we treat these kids is very likely to impact their loyalties as they grow older. If we marginalize them, infantilize them, insult them, hurt them, hate them, or judge them we are likely sealing their fate. So while I don&#8217;t think we can possibly control all the factors that might push someone to leave Orthodox Judaism, we can adjust our attitude toward people who are on the margins. They must be made to feel comfortable, loved, accepted, important, smart, and capable of contributing positively to the community. That is something we can control and it is something that should be done regardless of whether it will keep more people Orthodox. But I have a feeling it would help the numbers too.</p>
<p>Finally, I do think there is a bit of a silver lining here. If frum people really think that mental illness, and learning disabilities, or even ADD is a huge factor in kids leaving Orthodox Judaism and that a peaceful home is of utmost importance to keeping kids frum and that we should instill positive Judaism in our education system in order that more people appreciate the beauty of Orthodox Judaism so they will want to stay Orthodox, go for it! I think it&#8217;s a bit disappointing that we would only seem to address these issues as a way to prevent people from leaving Orthodox Judaism, but if that&#8217;s what gets people exciting about solving these problems, I am all for it. I would prefer if these challenges were addressed simply because they are important issues on their own, but sometimes people need superficial motivation to do the right thing. At the very least we can justify putting more resources into solving these very real problems for the sake of all the people who are affecting by them, not just the kids who are at risk of leaving Orthodox Judaism.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayishlach<br />
An Important Parenting Tip From Yaakov</h2>
<p>Yaakov Avinu’s dreaded  encounter with <em>Eisav harasha</em> concludes happily with Eisav’s invitation for Yaakov to accompany him. Yaakov declines, explaining that his children are young and he is overladen with sheep and cattle. Yaakov, therefore, urges Eisav to set forth without him and proclaims “<em>va’ani esnahal l’iti liregel hamilacha asher lifanai uli’regel hayiladim </em>— I (Yaakov) will travel at my <em>own</em> pace congruent with the task at hand and the ability of the children.” <em>Chazal</em> derive many important lessons from the entire Yaakov/Eisav encounter. One particular insight is gleaned from the above response of Yaakov Avinu to his brother Eisav which provides us a critical perspective into <em>Chinuch Habanim</em>.</p>
<p>Parents have dreams for their children. Often, we set up expectations based upon our own personal goals and agendas. Sometimes, we push our youngsters hard towards these goals. Other times, we assert a <em>laissez faire</em> attitude toward their responsibilities. In general, we want them to like what we like and think how we think. We may even live vicariously through a particular child. All of the above can be a formula for disaster.</p>
<p><span id="more-6553"></span>Yaakov Avinu teaches us that in order to arrive “<em>shalem</em>”–with our family spiritually whole and intact, we must set the ambitions for <em>each</em> of our<em> kinderlach</em> “<em>l’regel hayiladim</em>” &#8211; at the pace of the children. Indeed, in setting goals for the spiritual, personal and academic growth of each child, we must consider his or her strengths, weaknesses, tendencies and character traits. One mold just won’t do it. To the contrary, we must tailor the nurturing of our children to their individual abilities and guide them toward being <em>Ovdei Hashem </em>with the G-d given talents they have been blessed with.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the<em> posuk</em> concludes with Yaakov Avinu telling Eisav that he (Yaakov) will keep pace with the children “<em>ad</em> <em>asher yavo el adoni s’eirah.</em>” Rashi notes that Yaakov Avinu never intended to journey to <em>Eisav’s</em> home, rather he was speaking of the future, the <em>yimos Hamashiach</em> of which it says, <em>v’alu moshiim b’Har Tzion lishpot es Har Eisav</em>. Clearly the unspoken message is that our ability to individualize our <em>chinuch habanim</em> is a significant, if not the requisite, force in bringing about the arrival of the ultimate redemption. An era of <em>shleimos</em> can only be delivered by our developing the <em>sheleimos</em> of each child in our care. Indeed, <em>Hashem Yisborach</em> has placed a unique<em> neshama</em> in each of us. Developing the individual potential of each child entrusted to us is our greatest responsibility and its potential affords us the greatest <em>nachas</em> of all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/family.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6377" title="family" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/family.gif?resize=300%2C208" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A bunch of people sent this video my way. They all suggested I watch the video and they all felt the video was very powerful. I needed to find 30 minutes to watch it. This morning I had an opportunity to watch it and I must say that I wholeheartedly agree with them.</p>
<p>The video is a student project (read: not very professionally produced) but sometimes simplicity is the most pure form of art. It is a documentary that tells the story of three daughters, maybe three and a half daughters, of prominent religious Zionist rabbis in Israel. I am not familiar with too many religious Zionist rabbis but I have heard of all three of these rabbis.</p>
<p>Each of the daughters is no longer as observant as her family. The film explores that tension in a very real way.<span id="more-6375"></span></p>
<p>In my opinion, the film is not about rabbis and daughter. Only one of the daughters seems to have been particularly affected by the fact that her father was a prominent rabbi. The other two could have just as easily been daughters of any orthodox family.</p>
<p>I trust you&#8217;ll watch the video when you have the time and I am sure you will have your own reactions.</p>
<p>Here are some of my thoughts on the video.</p>
<p>The fathers come off really well. I am sure it was not always so pleasant growing up as a rebellious daughter of a prominent rabbi. Yet they are portrayed at loving, down to earth, and genuinely concerned about their daughters. Especially Rav Aviner.</p>
<p>The daughters all seem really artistic, artsy even. I think this is a very important point. Of all the personality types that might not be compatible with orthodox Judaism, I think the artsy type could be the most difficult. Artsy types, and I know this is a generalization, value and crave independence. Freedom of expression and thought is a large part of what makes people artistic. Conforming to orthodox Judaism is hard for artsy types if they are born into it. A lot of Baalei Teshuva are artsy for the opposite reason. They left their homes and expressed themselves via orthodox Judaism. But I think it is still fair to say that the artistic Baalei Teshuva are non-conformist orthodox Jews. I think that is great. But we need to find more opportunities for artsy types who are born into orthodox Judaism, especially for young women.</p>
<p>Thinking about this from a rabbinic perspective was interesting. First of all, I am the son of a rabbi. My experience actually somewhat mirrored the one daughter (Bigman) whose experience was rabbi-centric. She was &#8220;more orthodox&#8221; than her peers as a child. I had a similar experience. My father was the principal of a modern orthodox school and we had higher religious standards than almost all of my friends. It was not easy for me either. Going to high school at Ner Israel almost turned that upside down as many of my peers had more religious homes than mine. Perhaps they balanced each other out. But I was able to relate to her struggle very much.</p>
<p>I am also the father of two sons of a rabbi. I know that it can sometimes be challenging for them to be the son of a rabbi. But in this respect, I don&#8217;t see their experience mirroring that of the daughters all that much at this point. I am not a super famous rabbi who is called away from his family too often. I feel more like a regular dad who happens to be a rabbi. But the video certainly illustrated the fears that I have in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>I am sure that some people will watch this video and attribute the issues these daughters have to their more open religious Zionist lifestyle. They will blame this philosophy for these rabbis&#8217; daughters leaving orthodox Judaism. This is burying one&#8217;s head deep into the sand. Amongst every kind of orthodox Judaism there are people who leave. There are daughters of every single kind of rabbi out there who have left orthodox Judaism. It is not a new phenomena either. It is a part of our heritage and history. I really hope that people don&#8217;t come away from this video and see it is a justification for living any other form of Judaism as a protection against this.</p>
<p>The most important thing about this video to me, is that it raises the issue of how to deal with children who are not following our personal choices. It can be extremely challenging for a parent when a child reject their way of life. Sometimes rejection is absolute. The parents are orthodox and the child is secular. Sometimes it is far less absolute. The parents are chasidic or very yeshivish and the child is modern. Or the parents are modern and the children are ultra-orthodox. These can sometimes be very challenging situations as well.</p>
<p>I think that it is very important that the parent / child relationship not depend on religious observance. It is hurtful to parents when children diverge from their parents&#8217; way of life. But that pain cannot be more prominent than the love of a parent for a child and a child for a parent.</p>
<p>Every child needs to feel accepted by their parents. Every child needs to know that they are loved for who they are even if they are doing things which parents do not approve.</p>
<p>In so many of our prayers and remarks around the High Holidays we note that despite our failings God loves us unconditionally. We need to be able to follow the lead of God on this one. If God can do it, we need to at least try.</p>
<p>Not everyone works the same way and not everyone can be exactly the same. We need to find a place in our communities and even in our families for different forms of expression. Sometimes those forms of expression may be in accordance with halacha, and sometimes they might be at odds with halacha. While the orthodox community cannot condone the breaking of halacha, we must understand that it simply does not work for everyone. If we want to have relationships with our friends and family who are not as comfortable in the box, we need to let them know that they can still be loved and accepted despite our religious differences.</p>
<p>Everyone yearns for acceptance. Clearly, in our homes we should not make acceptance dependent on religious practice. But even in our communities we should not make acceptance dependent on religious practice. The Jewish people are a family. We have all types and that&#8217;s just fine with us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/images.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6371" title="images" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/images.jpeg?resize=270%2C187" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>If you&#8217;ve ever been to a Bar Mitzvah party you know that the event has two separate components. There are adults congratulating the parents on their son&#8217;s wonderful performance and on the spectacular food. These people are generally well behaved.</p>
<p>Then there are the kids.</p>
<p>Oy vey, the kids.</p>
<p>At my bar mitzvah, the kids threw soda bottles agains the wall outside the hall in the hope that they would explode. Mind you, my father was the dean of the school, so this would be the most well behaved of the bar mitzvahs parties. When we were well behaved, in brief bouts, we were still mischievously pouring salt and pickle juice into our classmates&#8217; cups filled with soda in the hope that they would gag or spit out their drinks. Ahhh, memories.<span id="more-6370"></span></p>
<p>Anyway, it seems that the adults were on to us the entire time. Now they are getting serious and want to put a stop to the shenanigans. The NY Times is reporting that across the spectrum of Modern Orthodox to Reform Judaism schools and parents are teaching manners and etiquette so that the kids will act like <em>mentschen.</em> This is a great idea.The more right wing kids need to work on this as well. The only problem is that it assumes that the kids don&#8217;t behave at the bar mitzvahs because of a lack of information. The real reason kids misbehave at bar mitzvahs is because of a lack of caring.</p>
<p>But the programs have spurned a new debate. Who is responsible to make sure kids behave and learn good manners? Is the parents? The schools? Both?</p>
<p>This is a huge topic and I think it applies to the right wing orthodox Jewish institutions as well. How much of a child&#8217;s education falls on the parents and how much falls on the schools? When children are not successful, is it fair for parents to blame schools? Is it fair for schools to blame the parents?</p>
<p>Obviously, the answer is highly case specific and on a continuum. However, the question is a valid one.</p>
<p>In my opinion schools should focus most of their attention to education. A child who is learning well and succeeding in school is far less likely to act out. Students who are floundering are the usual suspects when it comes to misbehavior. In my experience these two things are related. If schools are doing a good job providing an education to their students there will be far fewer students with behavior issues.</p>
<p>Of course there are exceptions. But as a general rule, I think behavior follows academic satisfaction.</p>
<p>Similarly, in my limited experience, parents who are involved in their child&#8217;s education and take an active role in parenting, have fewer behavior problems with their children. So if parents want well behaved children, the key is not to &#8220;teach behavior&#8221;. The key is to be a good parent.</p>
<p>Then again, bar mitzvah kids are 13. Let&#8217;s not get carried away with our expectations of their behavior either&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s what I think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/youtwitface.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6197" title="youtwitface" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/youtwitface.jpg?resize=300%2C105" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Adults are using social media (gosh, how I dislike that term) at a breakneck pace. Communication via Facebook and other sites is completely normal in 2012. People share their lives and their ideas on these sites and there are plenty of potential benefits as well as potential problems.</p>
<p>Adults are responsible for themselves and whatever trouble they may find for themselves is their problem. That&#8217;s what being a grown-up is all about.</p>
<p>Children are a different story. Parents are responsible to their children to protect them from harm and to prepare them for life. Any challenge that presents itself to children should be successfully navigated with the assistance, or guidance, or upon the teaching of adults.<span id="more-6195"></span></p>
<p>So when it comes to social media and children, the parents are placed in their familiar role as parents. Responsible parents don&#8217;t let their children drive cars before they have their license. They don&#8217;t allow them to choose to watch whatever television programs or movies they think they want. Good parents would not drop their child off at an amusement park and tell them that they are on their own. Similarly, responsible parents would not allow their children carte blanche use of the computer and the Internet. The Jewish Action talked with a broad spectrum of educators and asked them their opinion on children and social media.</p>
<p>I endorse the idea of having this conversation. Children need direction and when parents do not have their own experience to draw upon, the idea of parenting on the fly can be very imposing and potentially disastrous. Today&#8217;s parents are raising children in a world that is very different than the world in which they were raised. The appropriate thing to do is to prepare ourselves as parent to meet the challenges of raising children in the digital age. Social media is a particularly thorny issue as it is ever evolving. Creating relationships online is dangerous stuff and unless it is monitored and managed properly it can become a serious problem. The Jewish Action is doing a great service by starting the conversation. Even if some of the responses are not that great, the conversation is taking place.</p>
<p>The various responses are not necessarily answering the exact same questions and so the answers don&#8217;t really overlap even if sometimes it is clear that they are not in agreement with each other. Some answers are substantive, some are not. I will leave it to you to read the various responses and make your own judgments.</p>
<p>We need to have this conversation in our schools, communities, and families. Invariably, the more reasonable approaches will mirror the approach that each group takes to other mediums. Hopefully we can use the Internet for good and our children will use it for good as well. Clearly, the opportunity that the Internet presents is great. With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>In my (insignificant) opinion, preteens have no business being on social networks. Teens who are in schools that frown upon Internet use should not be on the Internet either. If they are on the Internet they should certainly not be on social networks. In more permissive environments, parents should treat the computer with rules akin to Yichud. Teens do not need smartphones. If they have them, they should not have unfiltered Internet access. Only in groups where everyone is on a social network should the idea even be considered. If parents allow their children on social networks they need to share the password and only parents should approve &#8220;friends&#8221;. Those are my thoughts.</p>
<p>One nugget worth sharing is this paraphrase that allegedly comes from R&#8217; Matisyahu Solomon by way of Rabbi Mordechai Yaffe. In his words: <em>&#8220;I would like to point out that I personally heard the venerated Lakewood Mashgiach Rabbi Matisyahu Salomon say that the Internet is not the enemy—the yetzer hara is.&#8221; </em>This it the first I have heard of this sentiment from R&#8217; Matisyahu. It is certainly a positive development.</p>
<p>I suggest reading the full article in the Jewish Action.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></em></p>
<h2>Parshas Mishpatim<br />
Learn With Your Children!</h2>
<p>The conclusion of <em>parshas </em>Mishpatim features a return to the description <em>matan </em>Torah. We are told how Moshe Rabbeinu alighted Har Sinai. Upon his return, Moshe told Bnai Yisrael <em>es kol divrei Hashem v’es kol hamishpatim</em> &#8211; all the words of Hashem and all of His laws. Klal Yisrael responded in unison and proclaimed, “<em>kol divrei Hashem na’aseh.</em>” Whatever Hashem says we will do. This is the second time since the saga of <em>matan</em> Torah began to unfold that Bnai Yisrael responds to the gift of the Torah with an emphatic <em>na’aseh</em> &#8211; we will do! Nevertheless, despite the sincere motivation of Am Yisrael, their declaration of <em>na’aseh</em> is simply not enough. Finally, <em>kabbolas HaTorah</em> reaches its zenith a few Psukim later as, Klal Yisrael exclaims <em>na’aseh v’nishma! </em>Crowned with this most famous, wondrous refrain of &#8211; <em>we will do and we will hear</em>, <em>matan</em> Torah is complete. We are gifted the <em>Torah Hak’dosha</em> for eternity.</p>
<p>What caused the change in our response? Why did we jump from <em>na’aseh</em> to <em>nishma</em>? What finally inspired us?<span id="more-5169"></span></p>
<p>The Midrash tells us that during <em>matan </em>Torah<em>, Hashem Yisborach</em> demanded a guarantor from Klal Yisrael that we would watch and protect the gift of Torah being granted to them. At first, Klal Yisrael suggested the Avos. However, Hashem said no. Klal Yisrael then suggested <em>shamayim va’aretz</em>. Again, Hakadosh Baruch Hu refused. Finally, B’nai Yisrael offered their children to secure their commitment to Torah. This Hashem accepted.</p>
<p>This Midrash appears to be derived from the verses leading up to the <em>na’aseh v’nishma</em> declaration. Following the second affirmation of na’aseh we are told <em>vayishalch es na’arei Yisrael</em> &#8211; that the youngsters of Bnai Yisrael were sent out to bring a sacrifice. Afterwards, Moshe sprinkled the blood on the <em>mizbeyach</em> and read the Torah to the people. Only now they proclaimed <em>na’aseh v’nishma. </em>Why? Initially Klal Yisrael felt <em>Matan Torah</em> was for adults only. For themselves they were ready to proclaim and commit to <em>na’aseh</em>, personal <em>mitzvah</em> observance. However, they soon recognized that it was the youth who successfully brought the <em>korban </em>needed to complete the <em>matan </em>Torah experience. Bnai Yisrael then offered their children as the guarantor of <em>Kabolas HaTorah. </em>As they did so, they came to the realization that <em>matan</em> Torah was not just for them but it was for their<em> kinderlach</em> and generations to come.</p>
<p>Now a process for <em>mesorah </em>would need to be established to assure the effective transmission of our holy Torah from generation to generation. Thus <em>na’aseh </em><em>v’nishma</em> was the call. Effective transmission of our <em>mesorah</em> calls for a commitment to doing and more importantly to hearing and learning! This awareness is critical for us to protect and assure the <em>mesorah</em> we guaranteed to our antecedents and that our children insure for us. Indeed, being <em>mikabelei </em>Torah and strengthening our link in the chain requires that we reclaim that <em>na’aseh v’nishma</em> attitude. No, it is not enough to send our children to <em>yeshiva</em>. We must do and we must learn . .  . . . . with our  children!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120127-0847151.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5081" title="20120127-084715.jpg" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120127-0847151.jpg?resize=300%2C181" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Last Sunday, two NFL teams advanced to the Super Bowl. Two other teams lost and were sent home for the winter.</p>
<p>One of the notable things about both games was the lack of heroes for the winning teams. Instead of the winning teams making a great play to win the game, both of the losing teams made mistakes that gave the game away. Instead of heroes we had goats.</p>
<p>In the first game, the Ravens made three consecutive heartbreakingly poor plays. First a dropped touchdown, then a bad pass when the quarterback could have run for a few yards and then a missed field goal from close range. The players who made the biggest mistakes, the receive who dropped the pass and the kicker who missed the kick lost the game for their team. Or at least it appears that way to the observer. Obviously mistakes in the beginning of the game are just as costly as mistakes at the end of the game. Yet, we somehow place greater emphasis on the glaring mistakes at the end of the game.</p>
<p>In our house we are fans of the Ravens. It was shocking and disappointing to see them lose in this fashion. Especially so, for my eight year old son. He was upset as I am sure millions of other Ravens fans across the country.</p>
<p>The second game featured an even worse anti-hero. Kyle Williams fumbled the ball twice in crucial kick return situations. He gave the ball back to the Giants and cost his tea the game. It was heartbreaking for him and for 49ers fans everywhere. It was his fault that the Giants won and people were really mad at him.</p>
<p><span id="more-5082"></span></p>
<p>Some people sent him <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/49ers/2012/01/23/kyle-williams-receiving-death-threats-after-nfc-championship/">death threats.</a>. Others just said horrible things about him. One seven year old boy was also upset after seeing Williams give away the game.</p>
<p>He was crying &#8220;but&#8230; why&#8230; did&#8230; he have to fumble?!&#8221;</p>
<p>His father replied, &#8220;if you are so upset, how do you think he feels?&#8221;</p>
<p>To which the boy responded by asking if he could write a letter to Kyle Williams to &#8220;make him feel better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is what the kid wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Dear Mr. Williams:</em></p>
<p>We just watched the Playoff game. I feel really bad for you but I wanted to tell you that you had a great season. you sould be very proud, so I wanted to say thank you.</p>
<p>I am your #1 FAN!</p>
<p>Owen Shure<br />
Los Angeles, CA</p>
<p>p.s. your awsome</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>You gotta love this kid. But even more than the kid, I think you gotta love the father!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure he was upset too. Most people who invest time into sports are somewhat affected by wins and losses. All the more so a heart wrenching loss like the one suffered by the Niners on Sunday. This father used it as a great teaching moment for himself and his son. Athletes are people too. They make mistakes and it hurts them when they make mistakes.</p>
<p>The anger towards athletes when they don&#8217;t live up to our lofty expectations can cause people to do stupid things. They write death threats and forget that their sports heroes have feelings too.</p>
<p>No one feels worse than the goats of these big games. Hatred and anger towards them is immature and misguided.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rest of country has to deal with another championship that will be decided between teams from New York and Boston. That&#8217;s something to get upset about! (Just kidding.)</p>
<p>Click the link to see the letter!</p>

(It all went down during my blogcation  <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/25/things-i-would-have-blogged-about-in-the-last-ten-days-if-i-were-a-real-blogger/" target="_blank">Things I Would Have Blogged About in the Last Ten Days If I Were a Real Blogger</a>) but didn&#8217;t include in that post because I thought I was going to blog about it anyway. I didn&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>Chua&#8217;s book (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594202842/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1594202842">Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</a>) is all about pushing your children to the limit. Expecting the most from them and demanding excellence in everything that they do. Allegedly. I have not read it. But I did read about 25 articles talking about the book.</p>
<p>To me it all sounding very similar to [stereotypical] Jewish parenting techniques as well. Push your children, guilt them if they don&#8217;t perform, give them every opportunity to find their special talent, put trophies on the mantel, etc. In fact, Chua is married to a Jewish man.</p>
<p>My thoughts at the time of the book&#8217;s release and articles were complicated, but the overall feeling I had was that there was not enough unconditional love in her parenting. Children need love as much as they need discipline. The world can be a tough place. Children depend on their parents for the confidence to thrive and knowing they are loved is an indispensable tool toward success. It seemed Chua&#8217;s parenting placed a premium on everything but unconditional love.</p>
<p>Now, a passionate, heartfelt, moving op-ed in the NY Times provides some perspective.<span id="more-4715"></span></p>
<p>A mother of a baby with Tay-Sachs disease writes about parenting a child who will not live past the age of three. Of particular interest to Jewish families because the child has Tay-Sachs, a disease that has very high frequency in the Ahskenazik Jewish community that has been mostly quashed by screening, this mother is Irish and the screening that she went through for diseases including Tay-Sachs came back negative.</p>
<p>So she is parenting a baby who will not take music lessons, karate, play soccer, apply to college or do anything remarkable that a Tiger Mom would hang on her Wall of Fame. And the contrast is stark.</p>
<p>It is all love, no discipline, no competition and no Mommy and Me. I think we all can learn from this Dragon Mom and not forget that as much as we want our children to excel, they want our love.</p>
<p>Read the article. I expect it will make you cry. It did for me.</p>

<address><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Yisro<br />
Royalty!</h2>
<p>The revelation at Sinai is the quintessential Chinuch experience. On Har Choreiv, Torah was taught to Klal Yisrael for the very first time. The instructor was none other than Hashem Yisborach Himself. There is much we can learn from Matan Torah in terms of the recipe needed for effective instruction. Examining the “Chinuch paradigm” inherent in the experience of Matan Torah we see that it is filled with structured, relevant, individualized content, powerful audio-visual aids, and unique special effects all of which motivated and inspired the active participation of all the talmidim. What a powerful model for teaching and transmitting our mesorah. However, we must look even more closely at the Sinaitic experience for an important ingredient that is sometimes overlooked in our understanding of Matan Torah. It is so relevant today.<span id="more-3665"></span></p>
<p>Before presenting the Aseres Hadibros, Hakadosh Baruch Hu tells Moshe Rabbeinu to stress to Klal Yisrael V’atem ti’hiyu li mamleches kohanim v’goy kadosh, “You, Klal Yisrael, are to be My chosen people and holy nation.” Interestingly, this is Klal Yisrael’s introduction to Matan Torah. As Hashem is about to give us His most precious treasure, the very gift which defines us as a people, it is not the sanctity of Torah, Yesodos of Emunah, nor Mitzvos or even Middos that He emphasizes but rather it is attitude.<br />
We are being shown that in order for the Torah to take root, we have to be aware of our potential. We can be a noble, chosen people. Indeed, we need to know who we are and what we can be! Seeing that it sets the tone for Kabbalas HaTorah, transmitting this awareness must become the highest priority in every educational setting. It is important in every classroom, be it the lessons taught at school or those modeled at home.</p>
<p>We all play a vital role in the development of this positive Torah attitude in our children, be it our own offspring or the tinokos shenishbu we encounter and hope to be mikareiv to our Father in heaven. The tone is set by our attitude toward the Chinuch activities that fill our lives daily (just about everything we do!) From “Parsha Time” at the Shabbos table to the alacrity and enthusiasm placed in Talmud Torah and mitzvah observance in our homes or in the public eye, we are the instructors and what we do matters.</p>
<p>Hakadosh Baruch Hu, kiviyachol, showed us a model at Sinai. When we help our children see themselves as a part of dynasty of kohanim we can hope to have the Siyata D’Shamya to rear them into a goy kadosh – a holy nation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/call_of_duty_black_ops2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3267" title="call_of_duty_black_ops2" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/call_of_duty_black_ops2-300x187.jpg?resize=300%2C187" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Violence in video games is a subject that has become a hot topic. Some feel there should be more regulation of violence in video games. Some have called for banning violent games for children. In California a board of censors has been proposed and the Supreme Court of the United States recently heard arguments for and against creating a censorship bureau.</p>
<p>The case turns of whether video games are protected under the 1st Amendment and whether that protection should be suspended in favor of protecting children from violent video content.</p>
<p>The ruling will be an important ruling for an industry that is larger than the Television and Movie industries in America.</p>
<p>One of the more violent game series released a new installment today. Call of Duty: Black Ops<span id="more-3266"></span> puts the player in the middle of a cold-war era war. The player controls machine guns, tanks and rocket launchers in their quest to kill and destroy the enemy. It is highly anticipated and is supposed to be the &#8220;next great game&#8221;.</p>
<p>Personally, I would rather not see the government censor for the sake of children. Parents are supposed to censor for their children and expecting the government to babysit our children is lazy, irresponsible and far more dangerous than the violence contained within the video games. Parents like to pass the buck. It&#8217;s easy to tell a child &#8220;Sorry, the law makes it illegal to buy that game for you&#8221;. It&#8217;s not so easy to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that game is suitable for someone your age&#8221;. We always like to blame someone else for depriving children&#8230;</p>
<p>The biggest difference between violence in video games and tv / movies is that the violence in a game is controlled by the player. In the player&#8217;s mind, he or she is committing the act of violence. In a show or movie, the viewer is not a participant in the violence, they are a spectator. Games are great because of their &#8220;immersiveness&#8221; and that is also what some feel makes them more dangerous than seeing violence on tv or in a movie.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops does not shy away from the allure of the immersive nature of the game. In fact they glorify it with their television commercial for the game. The ad features regular folks in their regular clothing, answering their cell phones while firing their weapons in a war scene. The ad has people of all races, genders and levels of fame &#8211; it includes Kobe Bryant and Jimmy Kimmel as well. The whole point of the ad is that when we play a game we feel like we are in the game.</p>
<p>In my opinion. the ad is ingenious. It really captures the &#8220;everyman&#8221; playing the game and becoming part of the game. However, the ad is not without controversy. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/11/call-of-dutys-twisted-advertising-campaign/66293/" target="_blank">Some say</a> it makes the game &#8220;too real&#8221; and it is disturbing to consider the effects of a &#8220;real&#8221; war. A game can look almost real, but never will it look really real, as it does in the ad.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t bother me. The ad is great marketing for a controversial product that adults can choose if they would like to purchase. There&#8217;s no sense avoiding the thing that makes these games fun&#8230;</p>
<p>Here is the ad. What do you think?</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah “Thought”) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Bereishis</h2>
<h2>The Chinuch Environment</h2>
<p>The tragic story of Kayin and Hevel is familiar to us all. The Torah recounts that Kayin went about rebuilding his life after murdering his brother. We are told that the first step in this self-renewal was his starting a family. Soon thereafter, Kayin had a son. He named him “Chanoch,” reaffirming his dedication to chinuch, educating his child. Then, we are told, Kayin took another step. He built a city, “vayikrah shem ha’ir k’shem b’no Chanoch — and he named the entire city for his son, Chanoch.” Why? What is the lesson we are to learn from this?<span id="more-2888"></span></p>
<p>Chazal teach us that we are all descendants of Kayin born of Noach’s wife, Naama, who was Kayin’s (grand)daughter. When Kayin was born, Chava proclaimed “kanisi ish es Hashem  — I have acquired a god.” Cute baby Kayin. His mother treated him as a little deity and assumed his perfection. She did not rear her son with limits and values. Indeed, her first born may have been somewhat spoiled. Lacking boundaries and priorities, he grew into a murderer. However, the adult Kayin, given the opportunity for teshuva, recognized that indeed, children need nurturing. Each child is a delicate flower which must be personally tended to. Yes, Kayin understood all too well, that a laissez faire attitude toward child rearing produced a horrific result. He therefore, focused his passion on chinuch habonim, educating his child with ethics and standards. But he knew (as do we) that to actualize a singular commitment to education requires more than a good home; it demanded that an entire community be developed that reinforced his ideals. Only then could he be sure that his son would be equipped with the morals necessary to make the right choices in his future. So Kayin built a city and created the environment for his offspring to thrive.</p>
<p>This message is insightful in rearing our children. We need to set standards and priorities for them as we nurture them at home and inculcate them with values in school and in the community. Their circle of friends, their exposure to media and their leisure activities need to be in consonance with our long term goals for their spiritual growth and development. Our activities as well, must reflect the realities we wish for our children. A consistent message of ahavas Hashem, yiras Shamayim and devotion to personifying b’chol drachecha da’eihu in each of our own undertakings will ensure the life long vitality of our children’s growth into the bnei and bnos Torah that we daven for them to be.</p>

In addition, I now need to thank MSNBC for informing me of one of the craziest ideas I have ever heard.</p>
<p>Today is Earth Day and I have gone on record supporting conservation and many green initiatives. I believe conservation is an important part of a Torah lifestyle. (See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/22/earth-day/">Earth Day and Torah</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/15/green-post/">Green Post</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/07/the-story-of-bottled-water-review-important-video-way-over-the-top/">The Story of Bottled Water Review: Important Video, Way Over the Top</a>.)</p>
<p>While I love the idea of being environmentally conscious, to me it is just a factor in making choices. We all weigh our priorities when we make choices and Going Green is something to consider among other factors.<span id="more-2398"></span></p>
<p>To illustrate, if one was confronted with the theoretical choice of saving a life or making a more Green choice, it would be obscene to suggest that the Green choice would be more important than saving the life.</p>
<p>There is a woman who was on MSNBC who suggested that people consider the environmental effects of having children.</p>
<p>Yes, having children.</p>
<p>She has all sorts of lovely data about the carbon footprint each child makes on the environment and therefore she urges people to consider those factors while decided if they should become parents.</p>
<p>All with a straight face.</p>
<p>If one is uninterested in procreating that is their own personal choice. But to evangelize in favor of not bearing children because of a reason like &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221; is, in my opinion, obscene. Thinking &#8220;green&#8221; does not mean that one should cease to think about anything other green. It means that we should consider the environment when making choices.</p>
<p>It barely even makes sense. I thought one of the main reasons people are concerned with the environment is so our children will have a safe and clean planet to enjoy. Who are we saving the planet for, if not for the next generation? Yes, I know, OTHERS will have children, but the point remains.</p>
<p>The right to bear and beget children is considered a Fundamental Right implicit in the Constitution. It&#8217;s a big deal. You don&#8217;t whiff on parenthood because of environmental concerns!</p>
<p>I recommend reading her article on <a href="http://www.grist.org/article/2010-03-30-gink-manifesto-say-it-loud-im-childfree-and-im-proud/PALL" target="_blank">grist.org</a> to see if it makes any sense to you.</p>
<p>The best part is when she says &#8220;I have lots of friends with children&#8221;. That is just like the &#8220;I have lots of [insert minority] friends to &#8220;prove&#8221; you&#8217;re not a racist. It means nothing with regard to racism and it means nothing in this context as well.</p>
<p>Then she has the whole &#8220;parents lose out on so much&#8221; argument. What do parents miss out on? and I quote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Time and emotional energy to invest in friendships and a romantic partnership.  Space to focus on a career or education or avocation.  Uninterrupted &#8220;grown-up&#8221; conversations.  Travel that&#8217;s truly impulsive or leisurely or adventurous (and never involves zoos).  Unpremeditated Saturday nights on the town and Sunday brunches out.  Opportunities for political or community engagement.  Stretches of quiet for reading or writing or relaxing.  A non-child-proofed, non-toy-strewn, non-goldfish-cracker-crumb-riddled home.  Eight peaceful, uninterrupted hours of sleep a night.  All without any guilt that one should be spending more quality time with the kid.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, parents do not &#8220;miss out&#8221; on all of that stuff. I know parents who enjoy many of those activities. Second, are these really compelling reasons? Those are the top things parents are missing? Sounds like trying to live a permanently immature lifestyle. Enjoy that.</p>
<p>Of course, Ms. Hymas would never want someone who was going to have children, not have children. This article is just for all the people who are on the fence or need something to use an excuse for why they are comfortable not having children. I just don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<p>Even that silly logo up top (taken from her article) is inane.</p>
<p>Also, it seems Ms. Hymas has a very immature view of the benefits of having children. And I quote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Yes, as a childfree person, I&#8217;ll miss out on a lot: The miracle of childbirth (though, truth be told, I don&#8217;t feel so bad about skipping that one).  The hilariously perceptive things that only kids say.  A respectable excuse for rereading the Harry Potter series.  The hope that my kid will be smarter and cooler and better looking than I ever was.  More boisterous holiday celebrations.  Someone to carry on the family name (assuming I won the arm-wrestling match with my partner over whose name the kid would actually get).  Maybe even the satisfaction of helping a child grow into a well-educated, well-adjusted adult, and the peace of mind of knowing there&#8217;s someone to take care of me in my old age.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Is she serious? These are the reasons people have children? To read Harry Potter? Hilarious things kids say? Seriously?</p>
<p>In my view, being a parent is great opportunity to grow as a human being. Learning how to give and love unconditionally and with no expectation of reciprocation is an opportunity. Not a burden. It is a chance to grow up and become a more complete person. Parenthood is about places another&#8217;s need ahead of your own sometimes. Being a parent means working on yourself to be a better person so your child will have a more complete role model. Sure, there are fun things about parenting too, but it is so much more than that.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of to make sense out of all this, is that when one has no core values one can imagine up any value to the primary value. I find this pretty offensive myself, but I think that is what happened to Ms. Hymas. In her worldview &#8220;going green&#8221; trumps procreation. I can&#8217;t imagine that is a very popular opinion but I guess it is possible.</p>
<p>Either that, or she&#8217;s just looking for attention and publicity. In that case, she got what she wanted.</p>

<p>At <a href="http://lls.edu" target="_blank">Law School</a> we are reading some of the most well-known Supreme Court Cases. A few weeks ago we read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade" target="_blank">Roe v. Wade</a> (banning 1st term abortion is unconstitutional) and the even more important <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_Parenthood_v._Casey" target="_blank">Casey v. Planned Parenthood</a> (upheld Roe) cases. Last week we read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson" target="_blank">Plessy v. Ferguson</a> (after Civil War, Separate but Equal schools were ruled constitutional).</p>
<p>This week we are reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education" target="_blank">Brown v. Board of Education</a>. This case overruled Plessy and made Separate but Equal unconstitutional in <strong><em>Public Schools</em></strong>.<span id="more-2235"></span> Brown v. Board of Education paved the way for Civil Rights activists like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to fight for equal rights for all people in all areas of life, beyond public education.</p>
<p>As I was reading the case I remembered a very influential &#8220;Parenting&#8221; episode from my youth. Growing up, we did not watch many movies. I saw a few movies on TV, like E.T. and The Wizard of Oz but that was about it. But I vividly remember my father strongly encouraging me to watch one particular movie with him when I was twelve years old.</p>
<p>That movie was a PBS special called The American Experience: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108139/fullcredits#cast" target="_blank">Simple Justice</a>. It beautifully told the story of Thurgood Marshall as he learned the law and was groomed into the perfect counsel for the Supreme Court cases to reverse Plessy. The climax of the movie is the Supreme Court case of Brown v. Board of Education and the Court&#8217;s ruling that Separate but Equal was not constitutional.</p>
<p>My father wanted me to see it and I recall a strong desire to study the law and become a lawyer after watching it. My preferred career path took some detours along the way, but several years later my interest in the law returned in earnest.</p>
<p>Today, our professor at Loyola Law School, <a href="http://www.lls.edu/academics/faculty/strauss.html">Marcy Strauss</a>, showed the very same movie to the class in lieu of a more traditional lecture and Socratic discussion. All the memories I had as a youngster were re-energized and I was quite moved by the movie, again.</p>
<p>Brown v. Board of Education raises some very important issues that are still very relevant to modern discourse. In just 56 years, much has changed in the landscape of race relations in the USA. Some things are still the same, or at the very least follow the same bigoted roots. There are other minorities seeking equal rights as well. Sometimes, we can go overboard in our sensitivities as I will write about tomorrow. And sometimes, one part of the world can be slow to see that Separate cannot be Equal, as I will write about the next day.</p>
<p>This movie is a must see. My father was very wise to encourage me to see it and I will always remember watching it together with him. (Thank you.)</p>
<p>The part of the movie that moved me most when I was a youngster stuck with me until today. I was talking with some friends at school and I mentioned that while reading Brown v. Board of Education I recalled a scene from this very movie. I had no idea that we were going to be watching the movie in class. I recounted the scene as best as my 12 year old brain could understand it and it was just as I remembered it when I saw it tonight.</p>
<p>The scene is of a study that was being conducted to analyze the way segregated black children felt about themselves. The tester would ask questions of the children using dolls, one black and one white. The results of the test showed conclusively that black children felt inferior. The dramatization of the test was very powerful and I found it on youtube so that you can see it for yourself below.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;To a better tomorrow&#8221;</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1326" title="heart in eye" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/20080210-red-eye-heart.jpg?resize=210%2C129" alt="heart in eye" data-recalc-dims="1" />A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></strong></p>
<h1>An Eye on One’s Heart</h1>
<p>With the conclusion of the parsha Moshe finishes his soliloquy, beseeching Klal Yisrael to stay the course of Yiras Hashem and Shmiras Hamitzvos. After 40 years of leadership, the prose of Haazinu and indeed all of Sefer Devarim was to be his epitaph and our eternal inspiration.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that after Moshe Rabbeinu concluded his message he framed his final instructions by saying<span id="more-1325"></span>, “simu livavchem l’chol hadivarim asher anochi mei’id bachem hayom asher titzavum es bineichem lishmor la’asos es kol divrei Hatorah hazos” — And Moshe concluded his words and said, “now place them on your heart&#8230; that you should transmit them to your children.”</p>
<p>In defining the structure needed for effectively conveying our Mesorah to our children, Moshe did not merely say to heed his voice and follow his directions. Rather, he said to take the message to heart. Why?</p>
<p>Rashi explains that Moshe Rabbeinu was expressing a powerful message for Chinuch Habanim, educating our children. Tzarich adam sheyihiyu einav v’aznav v’libo michuvanim l’divrei Torah! Yes, to transmit our heritage one must have his eyes, ears and heart tuned in to the powerful lessons of Torah.</p>
<p>Lip service alone won’t do. A Torah lifestyle has to be seen as relevant in all aspects of our lives. Yiras Shamayim has to be heard as the natural sound of our daily Avodah. Indeed, our dveikus b’Hashem has to be so palpable that it can be felt, heart-to-heart in our home and on the job. Our children will then sense and absorb this multi-modal lesson and live it as well.</p>
<p>So how does one get there? Upon closer examination Rashi leaves us with an even more profound message. In commenting on the posuk and the need to “simu livavhchem” to engage your heart in avodas Hashem, Rashi presents a vital sequence. First he tells us sheyhyu einav—that your eyes must be focused on your relationship with Hashem and His Torah. Without training our outlook, refining our vision and conditioning our perspective to a Torah point of a view we will never get our heart into to it.</p>
<p>Our avoda starts with our eyes. With seeing ourselves and the Ribbono Shel Olam as relevant, personal meaningful and loving. We can then “hear” what he wants from us and we can feel with a full heart our deep closeness to Him and His closeness to us. After all, if we only knew how much Hashem Yisborach loved us, we would never do anything wrong.</p>
<p>Moshe Rabbeinu’s paradigm for Chinuch is as relevant today as it was the first time he spoke these words. When it comes to our yiddishkeit It is not enough to know. We must have heart. To get there we must develop our outlook. Indeed, it is vital for children to see and hear the living words of Torah in our lives.</p>
<p>In so doing we will be zoche to a g’mar chasimah tova, lanu ul’chol Yisrael.</p>

<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/09/17/kim-clijsters-tennis-champion-and-mother/" target="_blank">Earlier today I posted about Kim Clijsters and the sacrifices of working mothers</a>.</p>
<p>It must be the impending Rosh Hashana that is influencing these thoughts of parents and children.</p>
<p>Parenting is tough job. There are no vacations. There is no financial remuneration. It is oftentimes thankless.</p>
<p>Also we are so clueless as to how to parent. Babies don&#8217;t come with a handy manual or set of instructions. The questions all parents have are endless.<span id="more-1185"></span></p>
<p>To punish or not? When to compliment? To be honest with our children about their shortcomings? I always think about Simon Cowell asking some terrible &#8220;singer&#8221; if anyone ever told them that they are just not talented. And then they cut to that parents telling their kid how great they are. No one wants to be that parent.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/15/health/15mind.html?em" target="_blank">very popular article in the NY Times about parenting this week</a>. The article explains, based on a study by 2 Israeli researchers, that conditional love can be just as harmful to children as punishment. Meaning, when a parent only doles out love for their child when the child performs as the parent expects the affect on the child is the same as punishing the child when the parent disapproves of the child&#8217;s behavior. The child may accomplish more, but will ultimately feel resentment, anxiety and feel unhappy.</p>
<p>The proper way to love one&#8217;s children is unconditionally.</p>
<p>Love is not a tool that we wield to bend the child into submission. Every child needs the love of its parents. Always.</p>
<p>This is a message we can take into Rosh Hashana. It is true that it is a day of judgment and that can give us reason to pause and be fearful of our verdict. There is a Judge and there is judgment.</p>
<p>We have one saving grace. The Judge is our Father.</p>
<p>The relationship that we have with God is the same as the relationship that a parent has with a child. Unconditional love.</p>
<p>When it comes to our moment of judgment in the heavenly court we know that we are unconditionally loved by our Father in Heaven no matter how far we may strayed from His path. Just remember that our Father is waiting for us with a warm embrace.</p>
<p>Children that feel unconditionally loved have less problems feeling accepted later in life. Unconditional love is the greatest gift a parent can provide for their children. Sometimes it may seem hard when children frustrate us.</p>
<p>A great video has been circling the internet the last couple of days.</p>
<p>The video really illustrates what I have been saying in this post. Even when our children frustrate us, we must love them unconditionally. Even if we &#8220;frustrate&#8221; God, He has a warm embrace for us. He is our father.</p>
<p>The father in this video looks like he is about to get frustrated with his daughter. Then he embraces her.</p>
<p>Perfect imagery for this post. Enjoy.</p>

The last three blog posts I have attempted to write have been all on the same topic. I have decided to turn them into two blog posts and this is the first of a two part series.</p>
<p>The topic is parenting. The relationship between parents and their children.</p>
<p>It is a timely subject as the Jewish Calendar turns the page into a new year. A major element of the Rosh Hashana liturgy is the relationship between us and God. That relationship takes a few forms. One form is that of a parent to a child.</p>
<p><span id="more-1183"></span></p>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/usopen09/news/story?id=4471433" target="_blank">Kim Clijsters won the US Open</a>. The US Open is a Tennis Tournament featuring the greatest players in the world. Clijsters was a dominant tennis player a few years ago and then she took a break to have a baby. She had the baby and two and a half years later came back to competitive tennis. Her first major tournament in her comeback was the US Open. And she won.</p>
<p>What struck me is the media&#8217;s attention to the fact that she was a mother and yet somehow was able beat the odds and win the US Open. I think that is noteworthy because parents have different priorities than non-parents. Parents put their kids first and their lives second. That Clijsters could be a mother whose primary concern was her child and still had enough in the tank to train and compete and win is very impressive.</p>
<p>Clijsters demonstrated the true strength of being a woman. She demonstrated the ability to have her cake and eat it too. Clijsters is at the top of her professional world and is also a relatively new mother. Congratulations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I just can&#8217;t help but wonder how all this affects her child.</p>
<p>Is there a cost? Does her child miss her mother when she spends long hours training? Should a mother of a young child be spending more time with her child?</p>
<p>I think it is great that women have opportunities for success. I really do.</p>
<p>But what about the child? What if the father is also working a tough, time consuming job?</p>
<p>Who raises the children?</p>
<p>I know that this question is broader than Kim Clijsters winning the US Open. But the media attention surroounding her success and motherhood got me thinking.</p>
<p>What is the feminist approach to this issue? How are parenting duties divided when both parents work? Does it even matter? Or are children just as well off being raised by paid surrogates?</p>
