				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7073" alt="Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Rav_Aharon_Feldmen_1237-200x300.jpeg" width="200" height="300" /></a>The Rosh Yeshiva of Ner Israel, Rabbi Aharon Feldman has apologized to MK Rabbi Dov Lipman for calling him a <em>rasha.</em> In his apology, R&#8217; Feldman says that he believes the MK Lipman is <em>&#8220;l&#8217;shem shamayim&#8221;</em> and wants what is best for the Jewish people including the charedim in Israel. Because of these revelations, R&#8217; Feldman says that MK Lipman is misguided but not a <em>rasha.</em></p>
<p>R&#8217; Feldman makes the case that MK Lipman is wrong or misguided using traditional Torah sources and accepted wisdom in the yeshiva world. He very emphatically disagrees with MK Lipman but the discourse is civil.</p>
<p>Initially, I was hurt and saddened when I read R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s original remarks. While I can&#8217;t say I am thrilled with his position on this issue, there is something positive that I can say. R&#8217; Aharon Feldman showed the charedi world what it means to be an honest <em>eved Hashem.</em> It takes guts to apologize. It always takes guts. But it takes ten times more guts when you are the Rosh Yeshiva of a prominent Torah institution and the subject of your apology is <em>persona non grata </em>in the charedi world. It could not have been easy to apologize but it was the right thing to do and for that I admire R&#8217; Feldman.</p>
<p>Further, R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s apology and argument is so different than the other recent charedi responses and rhetoric towards MK Lipman. It was respectful and somewhat positive. Again, I don&#8217;t love R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s position on this issue. But I do appreciate how stark the difference is between the way he is handling this and the way some other charedim are handling it.<span id="more-7072"></span></p>
<p>Look, it is easy to be cynical and say that R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s speech was more of the same. But I see it differently. There was some dignity in this dispute and it was not laced with disgust and revulsion. It&#8217;s sad to say it, but that is a huge improvement and I hope that those who jumped on R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s bandwagon when he called MK Lipman a <em>rasha</em> are just as quickly jumping on his bandwagon of toning down the rhetoric.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t intend to come off as one with a bias of low expectations. Not at all. I am simply comparing what R&#8217; Feldman said and did in his apology with what I have been hearing from pseudonymous writers on frum sites and their commenters. It&#8217;s a breath of fresh air and I applaud R&#8217; Feldman for doing what was right.</p>
<p>One level deeper, it gives me hope that others can see that R&#8217; Feldman is simply trying to do what is <em>emes.</em> He is not attempting character assassination for the sake of a cause. He thinks MK Lipman is wrong and told him so. But he sounds reasonable. I think the difference stems from something he alluded to in his apology. R&#8217; Feldman said that MK Lipman is a <em>shogeig</em> and a <em>shogeig</em> isn&#8217;t a <em>rasha.</em> What he means is that he is looking at his through a lens of halacha. He is not looking at it through a lens of pure politics.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are counter arguments to R&#8217; Feldman&#8217;s opinion. My point here is not to say that R&#8217; Feldman made his arguments so convincingly that the discussion is closed. Rather, the way R&#8217; Feldman spoke to MK Lipman means that there is hope the discussion is still open.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7062" alt="174928094" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/174928094-300x173.jpg" width="300" height="173" /></a>MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is ruffling the feathers of many charedi Gedolim in Israel and America. It seems there are two levels to the rhetoric against MK Lipman.</p>
<p>Primarily, I think many have a problem with him by dint of his association with MK Yair Lapid. It is an article of faith that Lapid is anti-charedi and since MK Lipman is a member of MK Lapid&#8217;s party he is guilty by association. I don&#8217;t think it would be possible to support Yesh Atid and have charedi approval.</p>
<p>Secondarily, many have a problem with MK Lipman&#8217;s positions. I think that his positions are perceived as anti-charedi and therefore anti-Torah. In particular, supporting a requirement that save for specific instances, all charedim participate in the army or national service and join the workforce instead of a blanket exemption for all charedim from service. MK Lipman also supports requiring a basic secular education for all Israelis, no exceptions. By the way, he also supports a better Jewish education for all Israelis, no exceptions.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care to discuss whether charedim are truly the most authentic orthodox Jews or whether they are corrupting Judaism. That&#8217;s a discussion for another time. I want to discuss the reaction of American charedim to MK Lipman&#8217;s proposals.<span id="more-7060"></span></p>
<p>In Israel, a charedi is identified by several social and religious markers. I list them here in no particular order, nor is this list exhaustive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Manner of dress. Charedim wear black and white, sport felt or fur hats, and shun modern style of dress like jeans or T-shirts.</li>
<li>Fear of God. Charedim place God and religion above all else. The word of God is supreme.</li>
<li>Daas Torah. Charedim extend their fealty to the word of God beyond the words of the Written Torah, and even beyond the Oral Law, to include the words of the great rabbis and treat their words like the word of God.</li>
<li>Torah learning is the ultimate service of God. Working for a living is not ideal at best and is actively avoided at worst.</li>
<li>No secular education. Charedim send their children to private schools which do not teach anything that is not found in the Torah.</li>
<li>Rejection of Zionism. The State of Israel is not recognized as a positive development for the Jewish people. It is more likely described as a problem than a solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is your Israeli Charedi checklist.</p>
<p>However in America, people who consider themselves charedi use a different set of parameters.</p>
<p>I think that American charedim subscribe to 1-3, but not necessarily 4-6. The only people in America who truly hold of 4-6 would be chasidim and not all chasidim would agree with 4-6 either. Certainly, many chasidim do not agree with #4 and in America even the chasidic communities are required to give a basic (not sufficient) secular education.</p>
<p>Why does all of this matter?</p>
<p>It seems to me, that American charedim are more similar to MK Lipman than they are to Israeli charedim. It is conceivable that MK Lipman could word his platform a little bit differently and still mean the exact same thing. He could say &#8220;I want Israeli charedim to be like American charedim&#8221; and the practical ramifications would be strikingly similar.</p>
<p>I think MK Lipman would be thrilled if Israeli charedim were like Lakewood charedim. They get a secular education, they work (eventually), they even support the State of Israel to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Yet, American gedolim and charedim in America continue to malign MK Lipman and his platform. I don&#8217;t get it. All he is saying is that Israeli charedim should be more like American charedim! He wants them to be like us! They should be flattered. Not insulted!</p>
<p>R&#8217; Ahron Feldman is a Rosh Yeshiva of a yeshiva that is precisely what MK Lipman wants for Israeli charedim and yet he severely criticizes MK Lipman going so far as to call him a rasha. It doesn&#8217;t add up. If what we have in America is good why is it not good for our brothers and sisters in Israel? And even if what they have could be conceived of as better, it&#8217;s not so terrible to be like the American charedim, is it?</p>
<p>True, the two groups share one name &#8211; Charedim. But they are different types of charedim!</p>
<p>The situation in Israel is complicated. Army service can be difficult for charedim. We can understand the reluctance to become less insular and take time away from Torah study. These are reasonable critiques of the sweeping proposals being discussed right now. But let&#8217;s be reasonable. We can talk about the issues and figure out the best way to deal with them.</p>
<p>I do acknowledge that there are some potential problems with MK Lipman&#8217;s plan. It&#8217;s not easy to just throw away the old system. There are going to be complications. But I think we will be far more successful if we work together. The plan is not to turn charedim into secular Zi0nists. How about just acting more like American charedim? Seems to me that it should be a workable solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/jonah_logo_main_e_large.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6583 alignleft" title="jonah_logo_main_e_large" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/jonah_logo_main_e_large.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="274" /></a>Conversion therapy is not counseling for people who convert to Judaism. Rather, conversion therapy is an controversial program that is designed to help gay people become un-gay. It is most popular among religious groups who feel that being gay is prohibited by the Bible and they desperately want to rid themselves of their homosexuality.</p>
<p>The problem is that these techniques are shunned by all mainstream mental health groups.</p>
<p>Recently a lawsuit was filed against JONAH for engaging in these unregulated therapy sessions and causing more harm than good. The details are a bit sordid and not really necessary to understand what is happening. The suit alleges that JONAH is using controversial therapy methods to change people&#8217;s orientation and are causing serious pain to many of the people whom they are trying to help.</p>
<p>California courts are grappling with this as well.<span id="more-6580"></span> On one hand, a judge has ruled that the therapy should not be used and issued an injunction against its implementation. On the other hand, a federal judge ruled that therapy is mostly &#8220;speech&#8221; and the government cannot regulate &#8220;speech&#8221; without contravening the First Amendment. Meanwhile, activists believe that the therapy is effective and feel that it is unfairly maligned. We will see how this plays out over the next year or so.</p>
<p>As it relates to orthodox Jews, Conversion Therapy has become a passionate point of debate recently as well.</p>
<p>In Hakirah, Rabbi Shmuel Kamenetsky was quoted as a proponent of JONAH, basically endorsing the therapy that they do. This was met with a serious rebuttal in the subsequent (current) issue of Hakirah. The RCA endorsed JONAH for a while, but citing current scientific evidence, the RCA no longer endorses JONAH.</p>
<p>Then there is the lawsuit mentioned above. The suit is being brought to put a stop to JONAH&#8217;s practices. Meanwhile, JONAH is operating with rabbinic endorsements. Losing the suit could present a problem for rabbis wishing to endorse JONAH.</p>
<p>In the current issue of Dialogue* (I asterisk it because it is more like a monologue than a dialogue) Rabbi Ahron Feldman writes a passionate article about homosexuality and the frum community. In some places it is mildly progressive, in other places it is not and I believe it to be severely flawed. Perhaps I will formulate a respectful response to the entire article some day. For now, Rabbi Feldman endorses JONAH wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>This sets up a classic point of divergence between the charedi and modern orthodox community. The charedi community still supports JONAH and the working assumption is that the current whims of science are inconclusive or flat out wrong. Whereas the modern orthodox community takes the science that has emerged very seriously and changed their recommendation of conversion therapy based upon that scientific evidence.</p>
<p>I honestly think that it is as simple as that. As for me, unless there is a doctrine of faith that is contravened by science (and I know of none) I see no reason to reject science simply in favor of traditional thinking.</p>
<p>The question becomes, what would influence the charedi rabbis to change their stance? Anything? Is that right or wrong?</p>
<p>While frum men who are only attracted to men (and frum women to women) are left to wonder if they have a place in orthodox Judaism at all. And if they do, where and how. And while it may be interesting to talk about how to help orthodox men who don&#8217;t want to be attracted to men, the more important issue remains how important it is that we create safe places for all people to practice and observe their religion, even if they are gay and orthodox Jews.</p>
