				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of our Jewish sisters, Gital Dodelson (Weiss) published a heartrending account of her marriage to a now-recalcitrant husband Avrohom Weiss. Reading her story brought tears to my eyes. It’s so painful to hear of her struggle and there were a few lines in there that resonate with all of us who may have some issues with parts of the Orthodox Jewish establishment.</p>
<p>There are two sides to every story and her husband’s family and supporters have supported Mr. Weiss’s right to withhold the get.<span id="more-7783"></span></p>
<p>I’ll be quick on the get issue. I don’t care what the supposed justification might be, I don’t care how terrible of a person a wife might be, I don’t care if she broke Jewish tradition, broke Jewish law, is an adulterer, is a bad mother, I don’t care about any of it. There is no justification for withholding a get. Wielding a legal document as a weapon to a person whom one willingly entered into a marriage and supposedly loved and shared a life with, is abuse. I cannot condone any forms of abuse. Emotional, financial, sexual, verbal, or any other form of abuse is against Torah principles.</p>
<p><em>(For more on this topic see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/07/answering-the-most-difficult-question-about-the-agunah-crisis/">Answering the Most Difficult Question About the Agunah Crisis</a>)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/divorce.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7784" alt="divorce" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/divorce.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Further, the statement from the Weiss camp does not justify not giving a get. Not even in their own words.</p>
<p>In fact, in this case there is apparently a letter (I say apparently, because one never knows if a letter is real these days) from leading Charedi rabbis who support Gital. This is an important fact as the Weiss family carries heavy rabbinic credentials and mockingly claimed that Gital was only being supported by YU and ORA. This is obviously untrue. More importantly, it doesn’t matter. There is no justification for withholding a get.</p>
<p>As an aside, this saga demonstrates how little social sanctions matter in contemporary Orthodox Judaism. No one cares. This guy is not suffering any serious social consequences for his recalcitrance.</p>
<p><strong>But I think this story is more about Orthodox Jewish marriage than it is about Orthodox Jewish divorce.</strong></p>
<p>Gital claims she did not want to continue dating Avrohom after the first or second date. Her parents and support group pushed her into it. And from there, her troubles began.</p>
<p>We’ve discussed the infantilization of young adults within Orthodox Judaism. Parents love their children very much and want what is best for their children. But parents are often wrong and often have different interests than their children. Yet, in the Shidduch System parents vet potential suitors, parents push children to continue dating, parents pay for the wedding and make it a party for their friends that the children are invited to, parents support their children and we all know that money comes with strings attached, the married couple eventually is thrust into difficult life situations with no real life experience, a minivan full of their own children, and no idea how they got there.</p>
<p>Young couples are hardly even given the opportunity to work things out. Dating is short. The focus is on external things and simple things like getting along nicely. But there is rarely enough time to even work out a problem together. Engagements are too quick and hectic to encounter and tackle real challenges. Obviously couples do not live together before marriage so there is no way of really knowing what that is going to be like. They get married and it’s traumatic for most couples. Which would be okay if they had the tools and skills to figure it out. But they don’t. Almost always, pregnancy begins almost immediately and now the focus is on a young woman surviving the difficulties of pregnancy. Eventually that becomes navigating parenthood. But again, there is little time to work on the marriage and the relationship. Let alone time to figure out one’s religious feelings.</p>
<p>Indeed, the system as it is today makes it increasingly difficult to be prepared for life’s challenges. According to Gital, Avrohom says he can’t handle it when things don’t go his way. He’s not the only one.</p>
<p>This dovetails into a bit of anecdotal disillusionment with Orthodox Jewish marriage and post-Yeshiva life. Anecdotally, people are finding it harder to make marriages work and finding it harder to make their frum lifestyle work in sync with their spouse. The sometimes spoken, but always unspoken goal of Orthodox Jewish life until 20years old is to get married. Get a good shidduch. Be a desirable match. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about and then everything is supposed to just work out nicely. Fall in line with the communal standards and way of life. People get married young and before they’ve had a chance to find their religious niche. It can change a lot between the age of 20 and 30. But most of us are married closer to 20 and by the time 30 comes along, it feels like it’s too late.</p>
<p>Gital writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“If I move on romantically without a get, I would have to leave this community — my friends and family and entire support system — because it’s committing adultery. My children and I would be ostracized and not welcomed in the community.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Some people might argue that I should ignore the traditions of the Torah. But I’m deeply religious and won’t go against the God I believe in.”</em></p>
<p>This is one part that made me cry. The feeling of being stuck is more and more common. These people want to be frum. They believe in God. They believe in the Torah. But they don’t believe in many aspects of the Orthodox Jewish lifestyle. But our communities are so monolithic that it makes being a non-conformist very challenging. Sometimes it&#8217;s even social suicide.</p>
<p>It’s easier in Modern Orthodox Judaism, but even there we see an expected conformity that can be uncomfortable for some. Today’s Orthodox Judaism is very rigid in its organization of people and groups. That kind of inflexibility is having an adverse affect on many people.</p>
<p>I am sure there is some Yeshiva guy out there who, after reading this article, says he wants to date for longer or spend more time getting to know a potential shidduch. But will the community and his parents allow it? Unlikely.</p>
<p>Others will read this and wonder why it’s okay for Weiss to terrorize his ex-wife but a woman who wears the wrong clothing is ostracized.</p>
<p>These are legitimate issues that are all raised by the saga between Gital, Avraham, and their supporters. I hope their situation is resolved soon. I really do. But I think the story illustrates some of our more systemic problems that are affecting many more people than just the few Agunos out there.</p>
<p>I thank Gital for writing her story. It gives us an opportunity to reflect on the state of normative Orthodox Judaism today and perhaps a chance to right the ship. It’s a big ship and it doesn’t handle very well. But the next generation of Orthodox Judaism will have a say in how it is steered.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of weeks ago, The Atlantic ran an article written by the loving wife of a victim of childhood sexual abuse. The article is difficult to read yet doubly rewarding. First, the appreciation for the challenges abuse victims encounter and how they affect those who love them and second, the very sweet end of the article nearly outweighs the darkness of the rest of the article.</p>
<p>I have often (naively) said that if the <em>gedolim </em>would really understand the way abuse affects its victims, it they would really comprehend the trauma and horrors of abuse they would not hesitate to report abuse to the police.<span id="more-7615"></span> I&#8217;ve been told that the <em>gedolim </em>have been made aware of the severity of abuse and to no avail. This article would be part of that presentation that I naively think would change their minds on abuse. In a very direct and practical way, this article demonstrates just how deeply the victim of abuse feels their pain. Further, it illustrates how far reaching the trauma of abuse can be. It affects so many people beyond the initial victim.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7616" alt="discriminacion-mayorias-2" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/discriminacion-mayorias-2.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /><br />
For that reason alone I recommend reading the article.</p>
<p>But there is so much more. In a large portion of the orthodox Jewish world, young men and women meet upon the approval of their parents. Mothers and fathers vet possible date prospects for their children. They rarely know these prospective mates personally. Rather, resumes are distributed and phone calls are placed to common friends and beyond. Parents are often overwhelmed with suggestions. It&#8217;s easy enough to eliminate the damaged goods before even embarking on a thorough investigation.But unfortunately there is a negative consequence to this kind of education in the orthodox Jewish community. Because victims of abuse are dealing with so much in their lives, they can be stigmatized and shunned as potential spouses.</p>
<p>Divorced parents? No thanks. Brother is no longer frum? No thanks. Sister didn&#8217;t go to seminary? No thanks. He&#8217;s in college? No way. She&#8217;s in law school? No thanks. Baal Teshuva? No thanks. At risk teen who figured things out at around 20 years old? No thanks.</p>
<p>Superficial details that have almost zero value in determining the true nature of the prospect can eliminate the prospect from contention very early on in the process. This results in a haves and have nots environment.</p>
<p>Organic dating avoids this issue. Boys meets girl, they get on well, they get to know each other, the develop feelings for one another, and then the superficial details emerge. By that time, very few sane people would toss out a relationship because his parents are divorced or she has a brother who is not frum. The relationship is more important than those petty details.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic dating has its own set of problems that the shidduch system can help avoid. I am not arguing in favor or against shidduch dating in this post. It&#8217;s just the reality of the shidduch scene that this is what happens.</p>
<p>According to my anecdotal, non-scientific research and basic reasoning skills, one of the greatest fears that frum abuse victims have is that they will be branded as damaged goods and find themselves at the bottom of the shidduch Totem pole. It is a legitimate fear. It&#8217;s stupid, but it is probably what would to happen. If parents hear a potential shidduch candidate was abused it makes sense within the misplaced priorities and confines of the shidduch system that they would just eliminate that person from consideration immediately.</p>
<p>By contrast, the first thing you learn about someone after meeting them is usually not whether they were abused. Obviously. In a good relationship, eventually it is likely to be disclosed and discovered and most probably dealt with together. So the abuse issue only arises once there is a couple with an existing relationship. If the abuse creates an unhealthy environment for a relationship that might doom the couple. But the information alone does not torpedo the relationship like it can within the shidduch system.</p>
<p>Thus, as much as we need to educate ourselves and our communities about the horrors of abuse, we also need to be careful not to allow ourselves to think that abuse victims are damaged goods who should be placed on the bottom of the deck when it comes to shidduchim. It&#8217;s a very difficult and narrow path to navigate but it is a necessary one. One solution to this problem might be jettisoning the shidduch system. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen. Instead, I think we will need to make a conscious effort to walk this tightrope. Let victims know that we empathize with their pain and their struggles. But we also are careful to make sure that victims know that we believe in them and in their ability to lead proud, confident, and successful lives. We all have challenges in life. Victims of abuse may have struggles that are more public than others, but we all have our struggles and no one group should have their struggles written off as inferior or that their struggles should automatically disqualify them from living orthodox Jewish life at its fullest.</p>
<p>For that matter, none of the superficial shidduch disqualifications make any sense. Let&#8217;s do away with all of them. But I think the abuse issue needs attention first because of how far behind we are in handling abuse and because suffering in silence compounds the trauma of abuse.</p>
<p>Please read the article and let&#8217;s start working together on the healing process, both individual and communal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am reluctant to write a post just to respond to a random &#8220;heartfelt plea&#8221; that was circulating on the Internet yesterday. In the letter, a single woman asks her friends for more understanding and in a series of contradictory instructions dispensed advice for her friends. I won&#8217;t respond to her letter. It&#8217;s too raw and too much emotion for a fair response.</p>
<p>In truth, the substance of the letter is irrelevant. Clearly the woman is in a lot of pain. She admits that she is basically &#8220;losing it&#8221; and it&#8217;s difficult to read the letter and not feel her suffering.</p>
<p>I have two things to say.<span id="more-7445"></span></p>
<p>The letter indicates that she desperately wants children. She doesn&#8217;t seem to care very much for a husband. According to my research this is not an uncommon sentiment. Young women who are looking to get married seem to be more focused on babies than men.</p>
<p>It could be argued that cohabitation with a male mate is just a mechanism for procreation and anything more is an unnecessary distraction. Modern people don&#8217;t think like that anymore. We view marriage as an opportunity for love. Finding a life partner has become a very important part of our culture. It didn&#8217;t happen in a vacuum either. Chazal already taught us that there must be attraction between husband and wife. It would seem like something worth looking forward to.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7446" alt="6a00d83452b15969e201910440d838970c-800wi" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/6a00d83452b15969e201910440d838970c-800wi.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>So why doesn&#8217;t she feel the need to find a husband? Two reasons jump out at me and both of these reasons speak to broad social issues.</p>
<p>She is reacting to what her friends are doing and talking about. Her friends talk about their kids. Her friends apparently don&#8217;t talk about their husbands. This is normal in the frum community. It&#8217;s not socially acceptable to talk about one&#8217;s spouse to others in any familiar way. If a spouse is mentioned, it&#8217;s very sterile and certainly not intimate. This is a function of tznius standards. It&#8217;s not bad per se but we can see a possible negative consequence of this strict silence on husbands and wives. It could be that single people don&#8217;t even realize that there is any beauty in a loving spousal relationship. They don&#8217;t hear about it from their friends and sometimes it can be hard to see it in one&#8217;s parents. Perhaps it would be wise to emphasize this aspect of marriage a bit more in our communities.</p>
<p>The second reason I think she may not be looking for a husband is because of the general approach toward men in the frum community. Women (and even men) are taught that men are basically animals. Women are taught (incorrectly) that they must dress modesty so that men do not sin. Men are told not to look at women because it will cause them to sin. Is it any wonder that young women are not looking forward to a relationship with one of these beasts? The discourse must change. We cannot talk about men in this way and we cannot teach tznius in a way that reinforces this negative portrayal. Maybe young women will actually want to get married for the sake of being in a relationship with a life partner.</p>
<p>The second point I want to make is that it should not be debilitating to be single. The frum community values marriage so greatly that it seems impossible to be a happy, well-adjusted, successful single woman. By broadcasting the importance of marriage, and it is important, we may also be projecting negativity toward single women. I think it would be good for our community to find a way to create a safe and productive place for single women. We should not be defining ourselves purely by marital and child bearing status. There is so much that needs to be done in our world. Single women can do so much. Minimizing them into potential baby makers is dehumanizing and we can see how it feels to be left out of the baby making party.</p>
<p>I feel for this woman. I really do. But I think we didn&#8217;t prepare her for this and we should be doing better for our singles. Being single is not a disease. It may not be ideal but it can be a great time in one&#8217;s life and great things can be accomplished. We need to figure out a way to make this happen.</p>

With an emphasis on furious. Noted author and trailblazer Yitta Halberstam wrote what might be the most universally offensive article about shidduchim that the world has ever seen.</p>
<p>Ms. Halberstam is best known for co-authoring the &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1598698419/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1598698419" target="_blank">Small Miracles</a>&#8221; series of books. She was also featured in an article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/04/nyregion/working-world-grows-for-orthodox-women-new-fields-and-strict-judaism-coexist.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm" target="_blank">NY Times</a> about orthodox Jewish women breaking gender boundaries (something <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/20/unorthodox-book-review-and-analysis/" target="_blank">Deborah Feldman</a> could have benefited from). This weekend, however, she set off a &#8220;small firestorm&#8221; and pushed gender equality backward by a couple generations.</p>
<p>The Jewish Press published an article penned by Ms. Halberstam. If you have not yet read the article, please click here and read <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/sections/family/purim-and-the-tyranny-of-beauty-a-plea-to-mothers-of-girls-in-shidduchim/2012/03/19/0/" target="_blank">Purim and the Tyranny of Beauty</a>, then come back here.</p>
<p><em>Caveat: It is possible that this article is satire. A Purim joke. If it is, then the joke is on me and all the people who missed the joke. If anyone knows with certainty that this article is or is not satire please let us all in on the joke. </em><em>Thanks. Either way, this is a superb example of something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poes_law" target="_blank">Poe&#8217;s Law</a>. Even if it is satire, the article raises real issues that are analyzed in this post.</em></p>
<p><span id="more-5291"></span></p>
<p>The article is so bad that I am not even going to attempt to address everything in there. For the sake of brevity, just assume that whatever raised your eyebrows and blood pressure, did the same to thousands of others. There are a few areas of discussion that I think are particularly important to cover.</p>
<p>First, the details. Let&#8217;s just get straight to it. Ms. Halberstam is actually suggesting that young women undergo elective surgery to fix their bodies. Yes. If a girl is not married in her early 20&#8217;s it&#8217;s probably because her nose is too big. Does it get any more superficial than that? It does not.</p>
<p>Let me count the ways that this is offensive and just plain wrong. Isn&#8217;t one of the points of dating for marriage via the shidduch system to avoid the superficiality of dating purely based on looks? Where do these guys come off being so picky about looks? Why are we playing into this stupidity? Don&#8217;t the Tzitz Eliezer and R&#8217; Shlomo Zalman prohibit elective surgery purely for the sake of beauty? (Yes, I know there are others who permit it. But since when is Ms. Halberstam qualified to decide this matter of dispute between the poskim?!) Does Ms. Halberstam know that some people are happy with their looks and don&#8217;t think they should cow to social pressure to look a certain (superficial) way? I mean, seriously, say it out loud: &#8220;An orthodox Jewish woman is advocating plastic surgery to improve normal girls&#8217; appearances&#8221;. Does this sound right to you?</p>
<p>Another detail. The girls who came to this meeting are an excellent case study. As an aside, Ms. Halberstam embarrasses them. She calls many of them plain-looking. This is not very nice. And it&#8217;s also very superficial. The whole point of meeting people in person is to get to know them and not make snap judgments based on their appearance. Ms. Halberstam fails at this. Miserably.</p>
<p>Then there are the girls. Why, in fact, didn&#8217;t they wear make-up? I venture to guess it is because of their Bais Yaakov education. In that world, cosmetics are often portrayed as the Yetzer Hara. They are to be avoided at all costs. The ones who do wear a little make-up are the &#8220;modern&#8221; girls. So is it any wonder that they don&#8217;t just transform from asexual teens to young women in touch with their femininity? Hardly. A similar problem, that is far more serious, occurs after marriage. It is very difficult for the &#8220;good girls&#8221; to adjust from complete insularity from sexuality to a healthy marriage. I bet that most of the girls at the meeting didn&#8217;t want the prospective mothers in law to think they were &#8220;loose&#8221; by charedi standards. I think if the girls were given more leeway in high school and &#8220;looking good&#8221; was not the work of the devil, there might be less reluctance to wearing make-up at a meeting of women.</p>
<p>The most important discussion about this article is the big picture. The current yeshivish shidduch system is a hybrid system. It is a combination of the almost arranged marriages of the most insular communities of the past and the common dating system of the West. In the hybrid system the parents vet potential mates, most of whom they do not know, and then the young adults go on a sufficient number of dates and if all goes well they get engaged.</p>
<p>There are advantages to this system. It avoids a lot of heartache and also the time spent trying to meet appropriate people. I used to think the system was the best possible system. And when it works, it just might be. But we are now seeing what happens when it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>What is happening now is best compared to &#8220;Crony Capitalism&#8221;. There are &#8220;haves&#8221; who get tons of girls recommended to them and there are &#8220;have nots&#8221; who sit around praying for a call. The &#8220;haves&#8221; get their choice of hundreds of prospective girls who stay the same age no matter how old he gets. The &#8220;have nots&#8221; try to find a match from the reject pile. Not to mention the levels of protexia and shmearing required to get a girl&#8217;s name into the hands of a sought after guy.</p>
<p>The girls are left with no leverage. They cannot look for a guy. The system requires that the guy choose the girl. And by guy, I mean the guy&#8217;s mother. There is almost never a list of guys waiting for a &#8220;yes&#8221; from a girl.</p>
<p>This is not a minor issue. Any system where the &#8220;haves&#8221; are spoiled by their riches will become corrupt. In this case, the corruption is in the narcissism of the boys (really their mothers). They become obsessed with getting the perfect match because they can. This obsession leads to lists, résumés, and many of the problems we are facing today.</p>
<p>Another issue is the attempt to adopt the model of almost arranged marriages. I am suspicious that when this was done in the shtetl, the parents knew the prospective match. They knew each other from around town. They knew their children well and they knew the other young men and women as well. In this kind of environment parental input is not only valid, it can be extremely useful.</p>
<p>But in our world, where young men study in yeshiva and young women study in seminary (and usually change a lot of their ideas in that year) and potential matches are made from across the globe, parental input no longer means what it used to mean. It is even possible, or likely, that parental input could be harmful. They may not know their children as well as they think they do. And that&#8217;s okay. But when the decision maker for whom to date is not on the same page as the decision maker for whom to marry, the results can be uneven or worse, catastrophic. Further, parents love their children. A lot. They will take the time to vet hundreds of potential mates to a degree that no one would dream of doing for their self. Parents are too dedicated. In this case I think it turns into a flaw.</p>
<p>I think, a limited parental involvement is wise, but parent overlords are becoming a bigger problem. But I think that is also a <em>symptom</em> of a larger problem. Many orthodox young couples are supported by their parents and in-laws. Since the parents have such a stake in the outcome, they are given a larger role. Perhaps if marriage was something that came after financial independence, parents would have a lesser role. And I think that would be a good thing.</p>
<p>You might ask how in the world young men and women will get married if their mommies are not taking care of all the work. There are two answers. First, young men will date more willingly without all the superficial vetting. They don&#8217;t care about all that stuff nearly as much as their parents. So the logjam will loosen. Dates will happen more freely. Idiotic details won&#8217;t make or break a potential date. I think this would help a lot.</p>
<p>But the best solution remains the proposal by Rabbi Steven Pruzansky in the Jewish Press last summer. In <a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/opinions/what-we-can-learn-from-chazal-about-dating/2011/07/07/" target="_blank">What We Can Learn From Chazal About Dating</a>, Rabbi Pruzansky suggests social opportunities for young singles to meet each other. This will increase their pool of friends from one gender to two. I think it is obvious that things will sort themselves out from there. This should be the system. In this future world, people get to know each other in a relaxed setting. There are no résumés, no built-in advantage for the guys, no proud mothers turning away the &#8220;riffraff&#8221;, no 180 degree turn from avoiding the other gender to cultivated a loving relationship with the other gender on demand, and as Rabbi Pruzansky so eloquently says, it is living by the dicta of Chazal.</p>
<p>I hope it becomes the yeshivish system before long. If it does, hopefully we will save our daughters from the horrors of self-image obsession that turn into eating disorders and elective surgery before one can buy a beer.</p>

<h3>Splitting of the Sea and Doling Out Sustenance</h3>
<h3>Beshalach 2009</h3>
<p>The most seminal event in world history occurs in this week’s parsha. The Jewish people leave the clutches of the evil Egyptian empire. After ten punishing plagues are rained down upon the Egyptians, the Jewish people are finally free. Their relief is short-lived, however, as they are caught between the proverbial rock and hard place. On one side they are met with the raging waters of the Yam Suf, which is known as the Red Sea. Even worse, rapidly approaching them is an angry Egyptian army. The Egyptians want revenge for the ten plagues as well as the return of the slaves whom they wish to un-emancipate.<span id="more-2081"></span></p>
<p>Thus the stage is set for a monumental salvation from GD. GD commands Moshe to stretch his staff over the raging waters. Miraculously, the waters split, peeling back to reveal dry land upon which the Jews escape safely. As the Egyptians follow suit, the waters come crashing down upon them and they are killed in the Yam Suf – maybe that’s why it’s called the Red Sea.</p>
<p>While the Jews were walking through the Yam Suf the waters had formed a wall on either side of them. The Midrashim tell us the wonders that GD provided within these walls. If one was hungry one could just raise up one’s hand and grab a delicious fruit to eat!</p>
<p>To be sure, the crossing of the Red Sea, was some kind of display of GD’s power and control over his world. We base our emunah (faith) very much on this idea. When we analyze the event we understand that to us it seems incredible to split a sea but in truth it was no big deal for GD. GD can do anything.</p>
<p>Which leaves us to wonder and try and understand the following section from the Talmud. The Talmud in Pesachim 118A tells us: For GD, the splitting of the sea was as difficult as providing sustenance to mankind. What we see here are two noteworthy things. Firstly that somehow the splitting of the sea measured high on degree of difficulty and secondly that the splitting of the sea is just as difficult (whatever that means) as the apportionment of each person’s financial needs!</p>
<p>Rabbi Shimon Schwab talks about how the hand of GD is more manifested and clearer in water than it is on land. The weather changes more quickly and in general the rules of nature are more immediately manifest on the high seas. Thus the Talmud teaches us in Kiddushin that “seafarers are mostly righteous”. The idea is that someone who sees a more stunning display of GDliness cannot help but see the hand of GD.</p>
<p>Rabbi  Schwab also brings the Midrashic source, the Mechilta in our parsha, that says that when Moshe raised his hand over the water, the angel of the seas did not wish to allow the seas to split. [Often an angel refers to the spiritual minister over a force, here it was the angel that ministered over the sea.] When he saw Moshe’s staff in his hand, the angel acquiesced. This is because the job of the angel of the seas is to ensure that GD’s hand is visible on the seas. If Moshe were to turn sea into land then the “seas would cease” and the hand of GD would be only as visible as it is on land – not very visible at all. The angel of the seas could not let this happen. So GD responded to the angel that it was worth a momentary lapse in divine revelation for the enduring divine revelation and fame of the splitting of the sea. The angel relented and the rest is history.</p>
<p>We have a balancing act between the commonly found divine revelation on the seas and the more intense divine revelation that occurred after the seas relented to the land.</p>
<p>This is something to which we can attach the word “Koshi” difficulty. Since there is an element of pulling back and a loss off the permanent fixed divine revelation in order to have a greater divine revelation we could call splitting the sea difficult.</p>
<p>This difficulty is the same as when we ask Hashem for parnassah &#8211; sustenance. While we are praying to GD there is a tremendous increase in Kavod Shamayim, Heavenly Honor. We are putting our trust in Him and we are showing a very high level of emunah (faith) in Hashem. When we put ourselves out there for Hashem to judge us and give us what we are asking for, we are placing our selves at a risk for a negative response. We say whatever GD wants for us good and just. This is a great sanctification of GD’s name, or Kiddush Hashem. We are creating honor for GD by praying properly. We recognize a profound dichotomy through prayer. In one breath we say Poseyach es Yadecha, “He opens His hand”, and in the other breath we say Tzadik Hashem b’chol dracahav, “righteous is GD in all His ways”. We ask for sustenance and we understand that it is in GD’s hands.</p>
<p>Therefore, for Hashem to provide for us and answer our prayers he is foregoing some of His honor, His Kavod Shamayim. As GD is forgoing that dichotomy which we recognize when we pray properly. In its stead it is our task to replace that Kavod Shamayim with the new and even greater Kavod Shamayim of serving GD with the sustenance He has provided us. Now that Hashem has provided you with wealth it is your job to use that wealth for more Kavod Shamayim. Therefore, Hashem is willing to forego the beauty of the one who is praying asking for sustenance and provide for him because ultimately, more of Hashem’s honor will fill the world. .</p>
<p>This is what is meant by comparing the difficulty of providing sustenance is like the difficulty of the splitting of the sea. There is more. The Gemara tells us that making a shidduch, a marriage match, is as difficult as the splitting of the sea. The Gemara in Sota teaches us that this refers to a second marriage. How is this to be explained?</p>
<p>According to what we are saying it makes a lot of sense. This fellow had experienced marriage and the beauty of a loving relationship. Now, he is missing all the beauty and intimacy of marriage in the hopes that Hashem will lead him to his true soul mate. He prays that GD will connect him with his true match. This prayer is a great Kiddush Hashem! It is “difficult” for Hashem to forgo this beautiful display of Kiddush Hashem. But Hashem does so to provide the opportunity for an even greater Kiddush Hashem when this fellow meets and marries his true love. The marriage will bring greater Kavod Shamayim than the prayers of a single person.</p>
<p>The lessons of this idea are many and profound in their own ways. Firstly we are reminded in these difficult financial times of the role that Hashem plays in our sustenance,.and that no matter the result we accept His will. When we are rewarded with wealth and sustenance we have the responsibility to at the least match our spirituality that we accomplished as we prayed for that very sustenance.</p>
<p>On a practical level we are also reminded that all our actions reflect GD’s glory. We need to bear this in mind and be conscious in our efforts to increase GD’s glory in this world.</p>
<p>We are blessed with this opportunity very often. The more we are able to expose our neighbors to the beauty of Hashem’s Torah the greater the Divine light will shine for them and for us.</p>
