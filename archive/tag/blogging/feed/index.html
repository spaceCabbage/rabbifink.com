				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6971" alt="part 2_1" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/part-2_1.jpg?resize=300%2C200" data-recalc-dims="1" />In the secular world, the print media is losing to digital media. Newspapers are being replaced by websites and journalists are being replaced with bloggers. Apparently the same thing is happening in the charedi world. The print media is losing to the bloggers.</p>
<p>The Yated Ne&#8217;eman has attacked blogs in the past but this week&#8217;s paper has a full page article attacking two specific blogs, Hirhurim and Emes V&#8217;Emunah.</p>
<p>In their article, Avraham Birnbaum manages to write a couple thousand words without saying anything of substance.</p>
<p>The entire premise of the article hinges on the presumption that the Hirhurim community and R&#8217; Gil Student use his blog to attack charedim on a regular basis. Birnbaum portrays Hirhurim as a <em>moshav leitzim</em> of constant charedi bashing.<span id="more-6970"></span></p>
<p>The reader has no way of knowing if this true or not seeing as Birnbaum does not cite a single example or offer a shred of proof for his salacious claims. It&#8217;s one thing to criticize a blog, it&#8217;s another to criticize a blog for something without any support. I went back and did some research. I looked at several weeks of blog posts on Hirhurim. It&#8217;s not so much that Hirhurim bashes charedim, it&#8217;s more like Hirhurim completely ignores charedim. I know that it does not feel especially good to be ignored,  but being ignored is hardly akin to bashing.</p>
<p>In fact, in my experience, there is no blog that promotes respectful discourse more than Hirhurim. The posts are scholarly, thoughtful, substantive, and respectful. If there was a blog that should be acceptable to charedim, it should be Hirhurim!</p>
<p>The Yated reached out to R&#8217; Gil for comment. R&#8217; Gil politely declined to answer the six questions they asked him in an email. The only other experience R&#8217; Gil has had with the Yated has been negative. It serves R&#8217; Gil no purpose to provide soundbites to the Yated. Further, R&#8217; Gil and R&#8217; Michael Broyde are friends. There is no reason for R&#8217; Gil to incriminate his friend in the pages of the Yated.</p>
<p>But the Yated is a scorned mistress. Birnbaum presents R&#8217; Gil&#8217;s polite &#8220;no comment&#8221; as a severe crime. His argument is the classic fallacious argument of  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10101483653832655" target="_blank">what I call the worst argument ever</a>: <em>&#8220;You are doing A in response to B. I think if it was X you would do Y. WHY ARE YOU NOT DOING Y?&#8221;</em> Birnbaum posits that if a charedi leader was involved in a scandal like R&#8217; Broyde&#8217;s R&#8217; Gil would be savoring every moment of it. But here R&#8217; Gil is silent. This is somehow unacceptable.</p>
<p>The Yated expects a response from R&#8217; Gil because of several assumptions. Then they turn a &#8220;no comment&#8221; into a terrible crime. As if anyone who reads the Yated read Orwell, Birnbaum invokes &#8220;a<em>ll animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal</em>&#8220;. Invoking Orwell because R&#8217; Gil said &#8220;no comment&#8221;?  This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Birnbaum claims that the Jewish Week and the Forward were hardly able to contain their glee in their reporting of the scandal. I didn&#8217;t notice that at all. But I might reconsider my position if there was a shred of evidence in the article to support this claim. None is provided.</p>
<p>I do submit that Birnbaum&#8217;s characterization of Emes V&#8217;Emunah is less strident and more accurate. Perhaps he just has an axe to grind with Hirhurim, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Birnbaum is incredibly preachy and condescending. But that wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if his article was rooted in fact. Unfortunately it is not. He just sounds like a child who didn&#8217;t get what he wanted so he stomps his feet loudly in the hope that someone will listen.</p>
<p>To me, this article represents everything wrong with lazy orthodox Judaism. The reader is expected to rely on the writer without evidence. The reader will likely take Birnbaum&#8217;s word for everything he says simply because he is published in the Yated and R&#8217; Gil is published on an unholy blog. I doubt any of the Yated readers will check Hirhurim for themselves to see if the levied criticisms are accurate. At the very least, Birnbaum could have suggested readers do their own investigation and come to their own conclusion.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not the way of the Yated or its readers. It is the paper for people who want other people to do their thinking for them. The Yated culture does not encourage critical thinking or challenging the status quo. Hirhurim does. That is the real story here. Aside from the print media vs. the digital media war, there is a more fundamental battle taking place here. Hirhurim represents critical thinking and the Yated represents blind faith in authority. One Hirhurim post has more footnotes than every edition of the Yated ever printed. Hirhurim invites open discussion. The Yated only prints things that are absolutely consistent with their ideology. That&#8217;s the real issue here.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll close with three points in summary:</p>
<p>1) The Yated should be ashamed of this article for its complete mischaracterization of Hirhurim without evidence.<br />
2) R&#8217; Gil has no obligation to talk to the Yated, especially about a friend.<br />
3) The Yated and Hirhurim operate as polar opposites with regard to independent research vs. appeal to authority.</p>

<p><em>Full disclosure: My esteemed father writes a weekly dvar Torah column for the Yated and is the voice of reason (obviously) on their Chinuch Roundtable.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/url.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5781" title="why" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/url.jpg?resize=300%2C214" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In less than four years, this blog has grown from a minor blip on the radar (I got 6500 hits in the first six months) to a substantial, engaging community of interested and interesting people (I get 6500 hits a day sometimes). Reflecting on my time as a blogger, I can see how my voice has changed, adjusted, and adapted to meet varying needs and wants as well as my (somewhat fluid) views on Torah and orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>If you look back at the articles from 2008 and 2009 you&#8217;ll see that they are a bit different than the articles I write these days. Not significantly different, just different enough to notice. But as I grew in my rabbinic position at Pacific Jewish Center, and journeyed through law school, and learned more Torah, and accumulated more experiences I found a voice. But this voice was not just my own voice. It was the voice of many Jews from every single kind of background that I have come in contact with through the last few years. (Similarly, many people are comfortable in my shul, while they are not comfortable in other orthodox shuls.) I am not saying I speak for everyone or even most people. Rather, there are enough people who find their own voice coming through the words when they read this blog.</p>
<p>It was never my intention to create controversy. It was never my intention to bash or insult large swaths of people. That may happen from time to time but that&#8217;s not the goal. In fact, I would rather do without it.</p>
<p><span id="more-5772"></span></p>
<p>Yet, I do find myself the target of criticism, usually from the charedi side of things, but often enough from the more liberal communities of orthodox and non-orthodox Jews. As a committed orthodox Jew, I recognize that I am easy pickings for more liberal Jews. But the criticism from the charedi side is more significant and has a greater impact on my reputation and career. I would therefore like to clarify and explain a few things to set the record straight.</p>
<p>My goal with this blog is to increase <em>kavod shamayim</em><em> </em>and <em>kiddush Hashem</em>. My goal is to nudge orthodox Judaism just enough to be more inclusive, more welcoming, and more attractive, to non-orthodox <em>and</em> to orthodox Jews. My goal is to inspire positive change that is permissible within the context of halacha. My goal is to facilitate conversations about the issues that are important to orthodox Jews and to everyone else. My goal is to increase communication between all people. My goal is to inspire people to find their voice within orthodox Judaism. My goal is to provide<strong> positive Jewish experiences</strong> to as many people as I possibly can.</p>
<p>Sometimes this means talking frankly and candidly about flaws in our communities. Sometimes that means challenging our leadership. Sometimes that means asking questions that deserve good answers. Sometimes that means finding ourselves in strange alliances with people who seem so far from our beliefs. Sometimes it means disagreeing with people far greater than me in Torah and with much more life experience than me. Sometimes it means making mistakes.</p>
<p>Am I a troublemaker? Should I be banned or excommunicated?</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>The style of orthodox Judaism that I try to endorse and promote is a similar style to that of my rebbeim, my grandfathers and my father. My rebbeim never told me not to ask question and challenge. I was taught to respect the words of great rabbis and I do. But respect does not mean blind adherence. Sometimes it means challenging. After all, if their words are to be revered and respected, their words should be scrutinized as well. And if the forum was a newspaper or magazine 50 years ago, the forum today is the Internet. I apologize if people think the Internet is a <em>moshav leitzim</em> and a place where it is impossible to have a serious conversation. I think that has been disproved a million times over.</p>
<p>My family tradition has always been to be activists and involved in community growth. My grandfathers were engaged in the secular world, formally educated, and also great Torah scholars and influencers in the broad orthodox Jewish community. The Internet is a natural place for this kind of work to take place in 2012. I get emails, messages, calls, texts, comments, and snail mail, acknowledging and thanking me for this blog. The correspondence comes from every type of Jew and from all over the world. The Internet makes this possible. This blog is a community and it is new kind of community that didn&#8217;t exist 15 years ago. That doesn&#8217;t make it wrong.</p>
<p>My hope is that by creating this space for important conversations we can all make our claim in the future of orthodox Judaism. We all have a stake in it. We all can have our voice in it.</p>
<p>There is a method to the madness. I try my best to invite good discussion whether it is on the blog comments, on Facebook (there&#8217;s almost always an equal, if not better, comment thread over there), the coffee rooms, or at your Shabbos table. I try very hard not to cross the line of impropriety. Reasonable people may disagree over where that line is. But I do have a line and I do try to stay on one side of that line. (The safe side.) I welcome criticism and suggestions. Those of you who have reached out to me know that I respond to your positive emails and your negative emails.</p>
<p>I think orthodox Judaism is great. We have stories of unbelievable heroism and leadership in our communities. Many people are living beautiful orthodox Jewish lives. There are books that have been written about these people and their stories. I don&#8217;t think I need to reiterate how much goodness exists in our communities but I will do it anyway. Go to any orthodox Jewish community. You will find open homes, open hearts, and disproportionate virtue and charity. We are getting some things right and when we are doing well it means we are doing incredibly well. We can sit back and enjoy how awesome we are or we can try and tweak the things that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>My point is that I am not trying to destroy anything. The things that it may seem like I am trying to destroy are really just what I believe to be cancers that are destroying us a people. Sometimes chemo is the only solution. Whatever is being attacked, is being attacked with the ultimate goal that the body come out stronger and healthier than it was before the problems were attacked. Sometimes the conversations get a bit heated. Passion should not be confused with disrespect. Passion means that the writer cares. Sometimes I write objectively but other times I write persuasively and it is those times that passion can be misunderstood.</p>
<p>I remain committed to the ideals of passionate orthodox Judaism. I want Judaism to thrive. I want it to grow. I want more people to find joy and satisfaction in orthodox Judaism. These are my goals as a person and a rabbi. These are the same goals that I have for this blog.</p>
<p>Thank you all for making this blog a fun and education place to gather together on the Internet. I hope this post explains at least a little bit about what I trying to do over here. It may seem like it has no rhyme or reason or that I am just trying to push buttons. In fact, there is a rhyme and reason and while I trying to push buttons, the buttons are the ones that I hope will bring improvement and increased vitality to orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I hope that if you are a reader of this blog and encounter people who criticize me or the things that are discussed here, this post will be able to quell their fears and reassure them that we are all on the same team. I truly believe in a future where we can all get along and everyone can find their place in orthodox Judaism. I am just trying my best to leave a little space for the out-of-the-box thinkers and non-conformists. We need all types in <em>Klal Yisrael</em>. Let&#8217;s just make sure there is a place for everyone.</p>
<p>Classically, Judaism believes that there is good and evil potential in everyone and everything. Nothing is intrinsically good or evil. The Internet presents us with incredible opportunities and tremendous power. If we are to ignore it and pretend it does not exists we may be wasting a great Heavenly gift. A place on the Internet full of fruitful and thoughtful discussion is a kiddush Hashem. I endeavor to make this blog just such a place. It may not make everyone happy all the time, but I am hopeful that we can agree on mutual goals and ideals and our meeting of the minds in those places allows for the kind of productive discussion on this blog and on many others.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want to be the problem. We just want to be part of the solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_5636" style="width: 196px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gra.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5636" title="gra" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gra.jpg?resize=186%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Gaon of Vilna&#39;s Talmud</p></div>
<p>A few weeks ago, I was alerted to a very interesting article in the NY Times that provided some really good food for thought. The article sets its launching point at an ornithological discovery in 2005. A thought to extinct bird was spotted and the evidence was uploaded to the Internet.</p>
<p>It seems that although there was enough evidence for the journal Science, thousands of bird enthusiasts dissected the evidence and have conclusively shown the discovery to have been a hoax (or mistake).</p>
<p>This kind of thing happens all the time. And it&#8217;s been happening for a long time.</p>
<p>Going back to the earliest days of writing, readers would comment, redact, correct, disagree, argue, and question what they were reading by writing notes in the margins or writing glosses or writing something to counter what they had just read. Later, readers of both the original and the subsequent writings would sometimes collect them and publish them together. Sometimes they would fix the errors, other times they would just add the notes of others.</p>
<p>In fact, this is precisely how the Mishna and Talmud were composed.<span id="more-5635"></span> The Mishna is made up of short snippets of Jewish law that were culled from the notes of prior scholars. The compiler, Rabbi Yehuda HaNassi, combined earlier opinions with later opinions and used his judgment to produce the best result for the future of Judaism. The Talmud then records hundreds of years of conversations and annotations on the Mishna. Ravina and Rav Ashi made the final choices about which comments, arguments, proofs, anecdotes, discussions, and clarifications to include.</p>
<p>To a lesser degree the same thing happened with the Midrash, as the author of the NY Times article notes. Throughout Jewish history, scholars have been using this method to develop Jewish law and thought. This is the way many of the Rishonim and Achronim made their way into our daily lives. Rashi on Chumash is a great example of this. He took his favorite interpretations that he found in prior works and now they are found as part of his commentary in almost every Chumash printed. The many commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch follow the same pattern. They had notes in the margins of their copies of the Shulchan Aruch and later printers wished to include them in their new versions of the Shulchan Aruch and now the Shach and Taz are household names.</p>
<p>The NY Times article argues that the Internet creates the same kind of writer to commenter interface. The writer says something. The reader has something to say in return and the result is sometimes beautiful discussion, and other times flamewar. Either way, much of the value in today&#8217;s writing is not found in the original article, it is found in the comments section. Or in the Facebook comments, or the Tweets, or the Reddit threads. Wherever it is found, the readers&#8217; contributions often have a lot of value.</p>
<p>Some bloggers, like <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a>, consistently tout the excellence of the comments on their blog. I tend to agree. DovBear has had some amazing commenters. The posts on this blog don&#8217;t usually generate as robust conversations as the posts on his blog, but when there are good conversations here, the comments become the stars of the show and the posts become basic material for discussion. <em>(Parenthetically, DovBear&#8217;s blog comments from over 7000 posts are on the verge of being lost forever. A tragedy if I ever heard one&#8230;)</em></p>
<p>In the tradition of the redactors and later publishers of the great works of history that integrated the original writings with subsequent comments, the author of the NY Times article suggests that the Internet needs a redactor. The best comments and opinions that follow the original articles need to highlighted somehow, even integrated into the posts. The give and take of the comment thread produces excellent material and oftentimes helps the group come to a better truth. It would be such a shame if all that wisdom was lost in the black hole of cyberspace.</p>
<p>But the real powerful point of the article is that experts and non-experts have an equal voice in the comments. And the crowd has a unique ability to ferret out lies, fools, and fallacies. If we all take our commenting duties seriously, we can help the greater community arrive at truths that may have been otherwise missed, either intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p>When it comes to discourse on religion, clearly there are some ground rules upon which we all need to agree in order to facilitate positive discussion. But when the rules are agreed upon and the discussion is vociferous, yet civil, we can benefit from coming closer to a truth. That is just another of the incredibly powerful uses of the Internet for the orthodox Jew. If we ban it, we lose that opportunity. I don&#8217;t think that it is a stretch to say that the Internet might exist simply for us to make the most of that opportunity and make the future of orthodox Judaism as viable and vibrant as it must be for our children and grandchildren.</p>

<p>But when the man is wrong he deserves to be called out.</p>
<p>In a recent New Yorker article, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell" target="_blank">Small Change: Why the revolution will not be tweeted</a>, Gladwell writes that we are told that the world is in the midst of a revolution. Twitter, Facebook, blogging et al have given the people a voice that they previously had not had. This will be the medium of social change for the next generation.</p>
<p>Gladwell vehemently disagrees.<span id="more-2940"></span></p>
<p>In his inimitable style, Gladwell makes the case that there is a qualitative difference between strong-tie connections and weak-tie connections. He holds that strong-tie connections come from real life social interactions and friendships. Electronic relationships only create weak-ties. Further, he contends that the purported social changes that Facebook and Twitter have effected are bogus. (He might be right about that one&#8230;).</p>
<p>Gladwell then demonstrates that all social change generates from relationships. I agree. Read this post for more on that: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/03/human-beings-are-social-beings/">Human Beings Are Social Beings</a>).</p>
<p>Here is what gets my goat: Gladwell assumes that relationships created with Twitter / Facebook / blogging are weak-tie relationships. That is an assumption that many would disagree with. Further, he makes this assumption while sitting in his ivory tower of &#8220;old media&#8221;, writing for a magazine in a dying industry AND, here is the kicker &#8211; he DOESN&#8217;T USE FACEBOOK OR TWITTER!!! Gladwell has a twitter account, in fact he has two twitter accounts and he has 22 total tweets between the two of them.</p>
<p>Shorter Gladwell: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to use Twitter, ergo, it must be useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, the next social changes will almost certainly come via strong-tie relationships. However, social media has the ability to create strong-tie relationships if that is your goal and you use them to achieve that goal. Revolutions will inevitably occur. And invariably the revolutions will take place in real life and they will also take place in the digital world. Those who have strong-tie relationships in the digital world will utilize social media to help their cause and that will be a decided advantage over the cave dwellers and Luddites who listen to Malcolm Gladwell when it comes to social media.</p>

<p>Today we are celebrating 300 posts on my blog. Hence, the fireworks. (To see the picture I DID NOT use, <a href="http://www.celebritywonder.com/wp/Gerard_Butler_in_300_Wallpaper_1_800.jpg" target="_blank">click here</a>.) When I started blogging 15 months ago I never dreamed I would ever have 300 posts or a respectable, regular readership. As you all know, most blogs rise and fall quicker than the President&#8217;s polling numbers. A big reason I have been able to maintain this blog because of you the readers. So I thank you.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I have compiled a nice list of posts worth reading. For some of you it will be review, for others it will be interesting to see some of the things you may have missed. As always I welcome feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Enjoy.<span id="more-2300"></span><br />

<p>I can&#8217;t believe it! A huge milestone!</p>
<p>At least I don&#8217;t forget my wedding anniversary. I did however, forget my one year Blogoversary. I am a week late&#8230;</p>
<p>This blog began last year on December 8, 2008. At the time, I had no idea that if anyone would ever read a single word I published. I am always surprised when I discover people reading my blog. But more than surprised, I am appreciative.</p>
<p>So much has happened, so much has changed in our world in the last year. Blogging from the sidelines has been a really great experience. I am glad I started the blog and I am glad that we are closing in on 250 posts.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, thank you for commenting, thank you for linking and thank you for supporting my blog.<span id="more-1909"></span></p>
<p>I look forward to another exciting year of blogging together.</p>
<p>In the meantime, check out the brand-spanking-new <a href="http://finkorswim.com/archives" target="_blank">archives</a> for links to every single post on the blog.</p>
<p>Only a few more posts til 250. We&#8217;ll celebrate that with a &#8220;best-of&#8221;. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>

It is called <a href="http://www.kcet.org/local/departures/la_river/" target="_blank">Departures</a> and it focuses on the people and places that make the neighborhoods of Los Angeles. For the last six weeks they have been working on Venice. Today they came to the Pacific Jewish Center Shul on the Beach to learn about us and to be included in their upcoming Venice piece.</p>
<p>It was a true honor and privilege to be a part of this worthwhile project. The production should be finished in February and I look forward to seeing that.</p>
<p>The camera crew shot some footage of our morning services and did two interviews.<span id="more-1649"></span> First, they interview Gary Dalin. Gary has been part of PJC since 1979 and provided great insight into the rich history of Pacific Jewish Center and the greater Venice Jewish community. He was eloquent and impressive in his interview and represented us very well. Great job Gary!</p>
<p>I was interviewed next. I hope I did okay. I myself have interviewed so many Jewish College student on camera and made those interviews into documentaries, so I know how hard it can be. (For two of my videos click <a href="http://werejustbetter.com/JAM/jam06.wmv">here for JAM 2006</a> and <a href="http://werejustbetter.com/JAM/Chase.mov" target="_blank">click here for Chase Edler</a>.) Among many topics, we talked about the juxtaposition of the historic quality of the Shul on the Beach to the future of outreach including this blog and my relative youth as a Rabbi. We also talked about the role the Shul plays in the boardwalk community, surrounded by the wild atmosphere of the boardwalk. It wasn&#8217;t too long, maybe a 35 minute interview in total, but we covered a lot of topics. Of course, there were some delinquents that felt the need to disturb us, that is just life on Venice Boardwalk&#8230;</p>
<p>I hope the final product reflects well on our special community and those who see it are inspired at least to check us out some time. I ended the interview with an open invitation to anyone who would like to see what we are all about and I extend that invitation to all of you reading this right now.</p>
<p>I also, want to thank Justin, Dan and Matt for including us in this project. I wish you much success in this endeavor and anything you do in the future.</p>
<p>Here are a couple pictures that Leslie Friedman took with her BlackBerry during the interview.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1638" title="Matisyahu-One_Day" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Matisyahu-One_Day.jpg?resize=240%2C240" alt="Matisyahu-One_Day" data-recalc-dims="1" />I first heard of <a href="http://www.matisyahuworld.com/" target="_blank">Matisyahu</a> while working as a <a href="http://jamoncampus.com" target="_blank">Campus Rabbi</a> at USC. The Jewish students on campus were really into his music (this was ~5 years ago) and some of my students invited me to join them at a Matisyahu concert.</p>
<p>He was performing at the <a href="http://la.knittingfactory.com/" target="_blank">Knitting Factory</a> in Hollywood which was right near my home. I went and it was really cool. The music was great, the message was equally wholesome and the connection that I got to build with my students was profound.</p>
<p>I liked it enough that I took my wife to a Matisyahu show at the <a href="http://www.ajula.edu/" target="_blank">American Jewish University</a> a few weeks later. It was a bad venue for a concert. It was more like a movie theater than the right venue for a reggae concert. Still, we enjoyed the music.</p>
<p>I knew that Matisyahu had made it, when<span id="more-1635"></span> I was listening to my then favorite sports radio show, &#8220;<a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2009/01/loose-cannons.html" target="_blank">The Loose Canons</a>&#8221; on AM 570 in Los Angeles (oh how I miss those guys&#8230;) and they played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO3ca5FshCY" target="_blank">Chop &#8217;em Down</a> as their bumper music. That was an epiphany for me. At that point, Matisyahu has &#8220;made it&#8221; in my books.</p>
<p>If that wasn&#8217;t sufficient proof that Matisyahu had &#8220;made it&#8221;, I received another clue a few weeks ago. I was playing the <a href="http://2ksports.com/games/nba2k10" target="_blank">NBA 2K10</a> video game and the background music was&#8230; Matisyahu!</p>
<p>I found a video of the NBA 2K10 playlist so you can see for yourself.</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="634" height="502" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_c76U_Eenhk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="634" height="502" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_c76U_Eenhk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>I thought that was pretty cool.</p>
<p>But today around the blogosphere and on Twitter the latest Matisyahu news is regarding the new NBC advertisement for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>This is, by far, the best exposure that Matisyahu has seen in the public eye. The commercial is perfect. The content, the timing of the cuts, the slow &#8211; motion, the music and the message are woven together to create a really perfect ad. The emotion that the 30 second spot exudes are exactly what NBC wants you to feel.</p>
<p>I like NBC as a network and I hope that they can mount a comeback and become relevant again. This ad is a great start.</p>
<p>I am sure Matisyahu is proud to be part of such a great ad. I am proud to share it with you.<br />

For a non-partisan blog that is a lot.</p>
<p>But once again, it would be impossible to ignore this elephant in the room.</p>
<p>Optimistic at best presumptuous at worse, President Obama&#8217;s recent Nobel Peace Prize award really pushes the envelope of credibilty.<span id="more-1372"></span></p>
<p>I am pretty much in 100% agreement with two of my favorite bloggers on this one so I will link to their posts.</p>
<p>DovBear nails it (as nearly always) and is most worried that <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/10/barrys-prize.html" target="_blank">the Nobel Peace Prize has been transformed into a political stunt</a>.</p>
<p>Conversations in Klal writes about the real (wrong) lesson here, that <a href="http://conversationsinklal.blogspot.com/2009/10/hell-of-carrot.html" target="_blank">we can be rewarded for promises with no results</a>.</p>
<p>My thoughts are along the same lines as both.</p>
<p>First, is this prize even worth anything anymore?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t a mandatory annual award cheapened by the fact that it must be awarded yearly with no regard for it being deserved? Doesn&#8217;t sound very meaningful to me.</p>
<p>My proposal is that when someone earns the award, give it to them. But don&#8217;t force-feed the public a manufactered awardee purely for the sake of awarding the prize. If no-one wins, no-one gets the prize.</p>
<p>Second, I am really concerned with the lesson being taught. Prizes must be earned. I wrote about this a while back when I wrote about a <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/15/winners-and-losers-a-new-yorker-cartoon-and-i-get-it-and-it-is-funny/" target="_blank">great cartoon in the New Yorker</a>. It is symptomatic of our generation that we reward prematurely and place people on pedestals before they have climbed atop the pedestal on their own.</p>
<p>We should allow things to progress organically and give projects time to breath and develop.</p>
<p>Patience is a virtue. It is time to put patience back in our society.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is just not much to write and that&#8217;s every bloggers worst nightmare. I had a few things that were on my mind that I wished to share but none of those ideas fermented into anything worth posting.</p>
<p>I love blogging and I think it is important to supply fresh content as often as possible. It is no fun to see the same posts every day. I needed something new.</p>
<p>Then I went outside and I found what is perhaps the most disturbing flyer I have ever seen attached to my car.<span id="more-1163"></span></p>
<p>Before my blogging days, I may have been annoyed with the person who stuck the flyer to my windsheield. But not this day. This flyer was so outrageous that I felt I must share it with you.</p>
<p>I present you with &#8220;alibisnpaybacks&#8221;.</p>

<p>Please read both and if you are able to help in any way possible, it is much appreciated.</p>
<p>One great thing about blogging is the opportunity to connect with other people for the sake of an important cause. Today, I present you with two important causes.<span id="more-1120"></span></p>
<p>First, there is a blogger who writes vitriolic, hate laced blog posts against anyone with whom he disagrees. He does so under the guise of Authentic Judaism. He makes no real arguments, just yells loudly at those he views as a threat (read: anyone who thinks differently than he). Apparently, he thinks that God spoke to him directly and gave him Torah and nobody else. A number of bloggers are trying to snatch the Google search result ranking from his blog.</p>
<p>I am here to help.</p>
<p>More importantly, DovBear is looking for some kind souls to help a family in desperate financial need. The economic downturn has claimed some more victims and from what I understand, their situation is dire. It is really easy to help, <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Just click here and click donate in the upper right hand sidebar</a> and donate just a little money. Type in the amount you can give and indicate it is for <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23familyneedsdough" target="_blank">#famliyneedsdough</a>. If you can give just a few dollars it would make a tremendous difference to this family. Every penny donated will be given directly to the needy family.</p>
<p>I appreciate any relief you can provide.</p>

Prominently displayed was a new book by Ben Mezrich called &#8220;<a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385529376?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0385529376&quot;&gt;The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=" target="_blank">The Accidental Billionaires</a>&#8220;. I am a big fan of Mezrich having read, <a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060575123?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0060575123&quot;&gt;Busting Vegas: A True Story of Monumental Excess, Sex, Love, Violence, and Beating the Odds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=" target="_blank">Busting Vegas</a>, <a style="&quot;width: 120px; height: 240px;" href="&lt;iframe src=" target="_blank">Rigged</a> and of course <a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416564195?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1416564195&quot;&gt;21: Bringing Down the House - Movie Tie-In: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=" target="_blank">Bringing Down the House</a> (I recommend all those books). I took a look at the book and discovered it was about the founding and founders of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>I bought the book.</p>
<p><span id="more-1033"></span>And so should you.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The book is interesting, tells a compelling story and most of all offers fantastic insight into our world. Facebook transformed the way we interact with each other on the web and in real life.</p>
<p>Before Facebook, the web was mostly information that <em>someone else </em>put on the web for you to learn from. The genius of Facebook is that it gave everyone the opportunity to share their lives with their friends on the web. Facebook is a web platform that is the really the voice of the people. Facebook wrestled the web away from corporate content providers and gave the power of the web to <em>you and me and our friends</em>.</p>
<p>Prior to Facebook there was MySpace. MySpace was and continues to be a big advertisement for one&#8217;s brand, band, etc. It is not a relationship building platform. Facebook is a place to meet and befriend people. It is your real life, just online. Facebook took the interactions of our daily lives and transported them onto a web page. That is why Facebook is not only the largest online community, but is also the most popular photo sharing site on the web. People share their lives in a natural way on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">Twitter</a> really took the Facebook lesson of sharing and community building and over-simplified it. Twitter has also become wildly successful because it builds community.</p>
<p>Understanding our highly interactive online world is important and this book really illuminates that reality.</p>
<p>The other thing that made the book powerful was the struggle the founders of Facebook encountered while attributed credit to the creator of Facebook.</p>
<p>See, Facebook wasn&#8217;t revolutionary. It was just social networking done the right way. Other folks had thought of similar sites and other sites were launched and they failed.</p>
<p>The tension over whose idea Facebook was is something that happens all the time in our modern world. People think of ideas or concepts at the same time as others. One of those parties may be successful with their version of the idea and the other version may fail. When the failing version owners realize they have not succeeded oftentimes they get angry, they file lawsuits, they yell and scream and make themselves look bad.</p>
<p>Much of the book is dedicated to appreciating this complex dynamic and it is a valuable lesson in modern fairness.</p>
<p>I recommend <a style="&quot;border:none" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385529376?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0385529376&quot;&gt;The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius and Betrayal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=" target="_blank">this book</a> (click to purchase) to anyone wishing to gain insight and appreciation for our interactive, modern, web based universe. As well as people who just like reading a good book about a college geek who became the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/10/billionaires08_Mark-Zuckerberg_I9UB.html" target="_blank">youngest billionaire in the history of America</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while back I contributed a <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/07/anonymous-vs-onymous-blogging.html" target="_blank">decent post to DovBear</a> that generated an <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/dovbear/5867413693300232675/" target="_blank">impressive response from legions of commenters</a> on DovBear. The post was a comparison of anonymous vs. <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/onymous" target="_blank">onymous</a> blogging.</p>
<p>I argued that by blogging about important things anonymously, they are less effective and only perpetuate the near censorship of right-wing Orthodox Judaism. Some went on to call anonymous blogging cowardly.</p>
<p>In the discussion that ensued I conceded that quite possibly, better conversation can be had anonymously and I admitted that for a blog like DovBear, the unfortunate reality is that anonymity is the preferable choice.</p>
<p>Something left undiscussed was the reality that DovBear is not anonymous. Google, who hosts his blog, knows exactly who he is, where he lives and presumably, has access to all his email, searches and web history. Until a few days ago, one may have assumed that their information was safe with Google.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p><span id="more-1025"></span><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=8359356" target="_blank">A New York State Supreme Court ruled</a> that Google was compelled to reveal the identity of a blogger using Google&#8217;s Blogger software. The blogger is question had posted defamatory comments about a fashion model that negatively affected her career. The model sued Google to uncloak the anonymous blogger and the court held that Google must comply.</p>
<p>Some may think I herald this as a victory for onymous blogging. Not so. If one is not comfortable blogging onymously his privacy must be respected. I urge people to <em>choose</em> to blog onymously, I am not on favor of <em>mandating</em> it and banning anonymous blogging.</p>
<p>The Bray of Fundie has an interesting post about his opinion on the ramifications of this ruling which is worth reading. <a href="http://innate-differences.blogspot.com/2009/08/defamation-of-masks.html" target="_blank">Click here to go to to his excellent blog called HaMavdil</a>.</p>
<p>(This is just one more reason to self host one&#8217;s blog. Technically the owner of a Blogger blog is Google and it is their information to share or withhold. A self hosted blog cannot be &#8220;outed&#8221; by Google as the blog owner is the rights holder to the information on the blog.)</p>
<p>But what of the courts decision? How does this affect the blogosphere? Some are calling it the &#8220;end of anonymous blogging&#8221;. That may very well be the case, but a new anonymous medium (twitter?) will crop up and still give voice to the anony-addicts out there. So really, the voice of the anonymous will not be quelled it will just need to move its home base.</p>
<p>The prospect of Google sharing our information is more worrisome than anything else. Everything we do is being recorded by Google. That can seem very scary.</p>
<p>Yet, when we reflect on this idea we can ask ourselves, is it so strange to us that our lives are being recorded by Google? Is it such a foreign concept that our every movement has meaning and does not disappear into the oblivion of infinite time and space?</p>
<p>Of course it is not. Our Rabbis teach us &#8220;V&#8217;chol ma&#8217;asecha b&#8217;sefer nichtavim&#8221;. All our actions are recorded in a &#8220;book&#8221;. Obviously, this cannot be a real, leather-bound volume published by Harper-Collins. I understsand this to mean that each of our actions has cosmic ramifications. Whenever we act, it affects us and the world is affected. None of our actions are meaningless that they would go &#8220;unrecorded&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is what Elul and the High Holidays are about. Realizing that our decisions and choices make real differences and hopefully adjusting our lives accordingly to make good and true choices.</p>
<p>The court decision in favor of the fashion model comes at a great time. We can take stock and learn a lesson about what it means for our lives to &#8220;recorded&#8221;; what it means to live life with the understanding that everything we do matters.</p>
<p>At some point we all will need to face our life&#8217;s choices. Let&#8217;s make the right choices.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/07/anonymous-vs-onymous-blogging.html" target="_blank"><strong><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear</em></strong></a><strong><em>. &#8211; more discussion there.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networks" target="_blank">Social Networking</a> has been around for a long time. The term is nearly two centuries old and the concept perhaps 30 times that.</p>
<p>With the internet explosion around the new millennium social networking became all the rage on the world wide web. MySpace and others blazed the trail. Now, blogging, <a href="http://facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> are an integral part of our social landscape.</p>
<p>Naturally, I was drawn to these new age ways of using technology to create social networks. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink" target="_blank">I&#8217;ve been on Facebook </a>since its inception five years ago and <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">joined Twitter</a> a while ago and have only recently begun to blog.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks some incredible things have happened that are direct results of social networking online.<span id="more-806"></span></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago a lovely woman came to our Shul on the Beach for Shabbos morning services. At the Kiddush (where incredibly, we do not have Kugel) she approached me and introduced herself as &#8220;Rena, I follow you on Twitter&#8221;. Immediately I realized it was <a href="http://twitter.com/tinsbar" target="_blank">@Tinsbar</a> from Baltimore. Rena was in LA for a few days and decided to come check out <a href="http://pjcenter.com/" target="_blank">our Shul.</a> Rena enjoyed her time spent at PJC and we enjoyed her company. In fact one community member even got some footwear recommendations from Rena!</p>
<div>When I related this story to a Shul Board Member, he said this is the new wave of Shuls. We have moved from being just a &#8220;Brick and Morter&#8221; Shul to a &#8220;<em>Click</em> and Mortar&#8221; Shul.</p>
<div>About a month ago <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/05/another-ethical-question.html" target="_blank">I posted the story of a penniless Jewish artist on the beach</a> who was homeless. He needed some money and I was not sure if he was a good candidate for Tzedaka and I posted my moral dilemma on <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">DovBear</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/e-finks-tzedaka-case.html" target="_blank">As reported last week</a>, an anonymous donor (living miles away from Los Angeles) who read the blog post here on DovBear, literally saved this man from a dire situation.</p>
<p>On Twitter I follow a wonderful couple from Connecticut. She is a blogging convert and is now in the process of a more stringent conversion that would be universally accepted. He is a fellow blogger as well who blogs about his relationship with his Judaism.</p>
<p>He recently discovered the wonderful Jewish town of Waterbury CT. With a Yeshiva, Day School, Shul, Mikva, Kosher restaurant and very affordable housing, Waterbury is quickly picking up young couples looking to settle (slightly) out of town. I read all about that on his &#8220;<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/onymous" target="_blank">onymous</a>&#8221; (it&#8217;s a new word that means &#8216;the opposite of anonymous&#8217;) blog.</p>
<p>My sister and brother in law live in Waterbury, I told him to call my brother in law and check out Waterbury. They set a date and spent a wonderful afternoon together.</p>
<p>In short all of this great stuff occurred as a direct result of blogging, Twitter and social-networking 2009 style. These events also occurred in many ways as a result of &#8220;onymous&#8221; blogging. The charity case required someone be known (in this case, me). There is no way Rena would have found me if I blogged and Twittered anonymously. And if I was an anonymous blogger I never would have connected my sister with two fellow Jews looking for friends and connections.</p>
<p>These are the benefits of &#8220;onymous&#8221; blogging.</p>
<p>On the other hand (term of art &#8211; remember that discussion?), anonymous blogging and Twittering is also great. In particular I point to DovBear&#8217;s blog as a bastion of anonymity and great discussion that would admittedly never happen if we all had faces, names and families. The unfortunate realities of the Frum world as they are, almost force us cower in fear when we disagree with authority or tradition and we tend to hide behind familiar rituals, thus avoiding conflict and we are safe behind the veil of secrecy that is anonymous blogging.</p>
<p>Anonymity gives the silent, a voice. It gives us all a chance to be heard.</p>
<p>In truth, we have other things to worry about as well. As <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/dovbear/7834534744960396147/#512532" target="_blank">Tikkun Olam pointed out</a>, we have Frum leaders blanketing all bloggers as a negative force, when we know that is ridiculous. There are some negative forces and many positive forces in the J-Blogosphere.</p>
<p>Worse is the fear we all feel of expressing our opinions. My opinion on this is transparent as I blog &#8220;onymously&#8221;. Speak your mind, challenge what you don&#8217;t understand but never lose the art of respectful questioning. I am (usually) not afraid to speak my mind and challenge what I don&#8217;t understand and thus I don&#8217;t need to be anonymous. Plus, I support many of the traditional ideals that &#8220;they&#8221; espouse. But, the crux of the issue remains the environment which we have created and now support that does not allow for us to challenge.</p>
<p>I say created, and that is self evident. I say support because we &#8220;give in&#8221; to the cyber bullies that force us to remain anonymous. How much greater impact would have as a group if those whom we challenge knew that we were real people? They should know that we have Yeshiva educations, wonderful families and jobs and we are frustrated with the status quo. But to &#8220;them&#8221; we are words on a computer screen, not people.</p>
<p>Words are cheap. Words have no soul when they are anonymous. If we want to be heard we need to be people. People have souls and people need to be dealt with. It is easy to ignore anonymous bloggers. People with souls demand attention and can affect change.</p>
<p>Should we strive to create a Frum culture that allows for challenging and questioning?</p>
<p>Are we helping the situation by blogging anonymously?</p>
<p>Do we lose a lot by blogging anonymously?</p>
<p>Do we stand to lose more by &#8220;onymous&#8221; blogging?</p></div>
