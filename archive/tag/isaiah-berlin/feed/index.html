				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6883" alt="Stout_Fox_and_Sage_Hedgehog" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Stout_Fox_and_Sage_Hedgehog-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" />One of the books I am reading now is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159420411X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=159420411X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail  but Some Don&#8217;t</a> by Nate Silver. It&#8217;s an excellent book and I highly recommend it. Perhaps a full review of the book will find its way onto the blog. In the meantime, I want to explore something Silver mentions in the book.</p>
<p>While talking about the general buffoonery of political pundits in the media, Silver notes that people are drawn to bombastic, all-encompassing predictions and most people are not very impressed with nuanced, unsure predictions. He doesn&#8217;t say this in the book, but that&#8217;s why Rush Limbaugh is so popular. He says everything with an air of absolute authority. Whether he right or wrong plays no role in how many people judge him. Subconsciously, we are all very impressed with someone who is assertive and unequivocal. When someone tries to explain why things are not so simple, we get bored and lose interest.</p>
<p>To illustrate this phenomena, Silver draws upon the well known poem &#8220;The Hedgehog and the Fox.&#8221; Isaiah Berlin wrote the poem in 1953 but it just as relevant today as it was then. The poem divides the great thinkers of the world into two categories.</p>
<p><span id="more-6882"></span></p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8230;hedgehogs, who view the world through the lens of a single defining idea (examples given include Plato, Lucretius, Dante, Pascal, Hegel, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Ibsen, and Proust) and foxes who draw on a wide variety of experiences and for whom the world cannot be boiled down to a single idea (examples given include Herodotus, Aristotle, Erasmus, Shakespeare, Montaigne, Molière, Goethe, Pushkin, Balzac, Joyce, Anderson).</em></p>
<p>Silver contends that most of us are hedgehogs and we like hedgehogs, especially in the media. People like soundbites and hedgehogs produce soundbites, Foxes do not. Silver advises us to try to be more like foxes and see nuance. Nothing is as simple as hedgehogs make it seem.</p>
<p>When I read this part of the book I thought about the state of orthodox Judaism and Judaism in general today.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve become very hedgehog-ish. By that I mean that we are dogmatic and tend to oversimplify great issues. Take the way many secular Jews think abuot orthodox Jews, it&#8217;s not nuanced, it&#8217;s based on stereotypes, and is usually not accurate. Take the way orthodox Jews think about secular Jews, it&#8217;s not nuanced, it&#8217;s based on old tropes, and is usually not very accurate.</p>
<p>When it comes to issues within the orthodox Jewish community, we do the same. Everything and everyone is labeled. Issues are called crises. Leaders are oftentimes quoted in simplistic terms without regard for specific situations and circumstances.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the &#8220;crisis&#8221; of people from orthodox homes leaving orthodox Judaism. People are looking for the &#8220;reason&#8221; or the &#8220;solution&#8221; but things are not so simple. I know many people who left orthodox Judaism. They all have their own story, their own reasons, and their own lives. There is no one reason. There is no one solution. But as hedgehogs, we think there should be one. To me, the only solution to this issue is to view people as people with choices and sometimes people make choices we are not happy with. Our job is to provide every orthodox child the opportunity to thrive. Do we do that? I don&#8217;t think so. Can we do that? Maybe not. The point is that it&#8217;s complicated. People want to hear a simple sound bite that will solve everything. Many speakers and writers try to do that. But in the end, it&#8217;s all foam with no beer. It all sounds good, but each individual situation needs specific attention. There is no silver bullet.</p>
<p>The people we tend to hear are people that proclaim that there is a unified theory to answer our questions. The people that get the biggest platforms are the ideologues with a single position approach to whatever they are asked. Chasidus and chumros are popular now because it&#8217;s easier to just buy into a system of extremism. It&#8217;s hedgehoggery at its finest.</p>
<p>But orthodox Judaism is complex. It&#8217;s okay to have questions and it&#8217;s okay to sense tension and contradictions. That&#8217;s where beauty is found. Pundits are popular, but they are fleeting. They have their time in the sun. Beauty and pleasure come from more nuanced and sophisticated views. It&#8217;s like the difference between a hotdog and a masterfully prepared steak. Sure the hotdog tastes good. But one who appreciates finer things wants to enjoy the complexity of an excellent steak.</p>
<p>We should not settle for simplistic approaches to anything, and certainly not orthodox Judaism. Let&#8217;s not expect everything to fit into a neat and tidy box with a ribbon and a bow. Life is complicated. Judaism is complicated. Let&#8217;s seek out the most nuanced and sophisticated positions within orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>Returning to ideas secular Jews and orthodox Jews have about one another for a moment. Is anything ever so simple? Let&#8217;s take the time to become more familiar with one another. We should strive to understand and appreciate each other. If we approach life more like foxes, we are bound to understand more about the world and the people around us. I think that would wonderful.</p>
