				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TheUnionisDissolved.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6466" title="TheUnionisDissolved" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TheUnionisDissolved-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190" /></a>If your candidate loses the election you have three choices. You can grin and bear it, move to another country, or secede from the Union. I have not heard of anyone actually getting up and leaving the United States of America in the wake of the election, and I am sure if someone does leave purely for political reasons we will hear about it. Though I wonder where a libertarian of conservative would enjoy living more than in these United States. Is there a country out there with more conservative / liberal balance than America? I don&#8217;t think so. But I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Of course, this is part of the blessing of America. There is always a balance. There are some states that are more liberal than others. There are some states with more conservative values than others. Put it all together and you get an odd mix of values, opinions, and policies that create a great country unlike any other.</p>
<p>The White House has a petition website where one can petition the government for just about anything. If you get 25,000 signatures on your petition, the government guarantees a response. There are now 20 petitions from 20 states requesting that the Federal government allow them to peacefully secede from the United States of America so that they can form their own little country.<span id="more-6465"></span></p>
<p>Aside from the logistical problems of turning a state into a country and the oft ignored fact that the Federal government gives millions of dollars to the states, conservatives and liberals would be wise to oppose these shenanigans.</p>
<p>First of all, asking to secede after losing an election is the very definition of being a sore loser. It&#8217;s like the kid who takes his ball home after his team loses and doesn&#8217;t let the next team play.</p>
<p>But it is much more than that. Part of what America great is the diversity of its population. We are a nation of immigrants and though we Americans do not share a common ancestry or heritage we share common dreams. We pride ourselves on the great opportunity that awaits the huddled masses from wherever they come.</p>
<p>One of the great checks and balances built into our country is the political system where conservatives and liberals and everyone in between has a voice in government and ideally our government represents the best of both sides of the spectrum.</p>
<p>It would be a disaster if our country lost its great diversity and political balance due to secession. Now I know that these petitions are silly and reactionary. But I just think that if we would appreciate our country for what it is, we would not see attempts to secede after losing an election. We need to be proud of our system and if we want to change things but have been rebuffed we need to adjust strategy or tactics, not take our ball and run away.</p>
<p>I feel the same way about Jewish institutions. The Jewish people are also a nation of immigrants and huddled masses. Although in contrast to America, we do share common ancestry and heritage which makes us even more connected to one another. Part of what makes us great is our diversity. We are proud that there are so many different kinds of Jews. People to the left of us and people to the right of us may disagree on substance and style, but we are still brothers and sisters. For that reason alone we must do everything we can to identify with one another. We cannot afford secessions. Debate, dispute, disagreement, dialogue &#8211; those we can handle. But we cannot tolerate a group seceding from Judaism nor can we ostracize a group so much that we create a secession by default.</p>
<p>Our differences are our strength.Â It&#8217;s not easy to understand or empathize with people on the opposite of an ideology. But it is the sign of strength, not weakness, when we do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mitt-romney-sad.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-6441" title="mitt-romney-sad" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/mitt-romney-sad-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></a>President Barack Obama won his bid for reelection this week. Many people were very extremely emotionally invested in the outcome of the vote.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s greatest supporters wiped tears of joy from their eyes as the president addressed the nation in his victory speech. Mitt Romney&#8217;s greatest supporters were also drying their tears as they were informed of the results (captured in spectacular modern form on this Tumblr: <a href="http://whitepeoplemourningromney.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Whitepeoplemourningromney</a>).</p>
<p>In the old days, when your candidate lost, you grumbled at home, maybe made some comments around the water cooler at work, or maybe even penned an Op-Ed. But in 2012, when your candidate loses, the opportunities to publicly grieve are so much greater. Conservatives (and liberals would have done the same thing if Romney had won) took to social media expressing their distaste for the election results.</p>
<p>This means three things.<span id="more-6440"></span></p>
<p>First, it means that people have an opportunity to vent, be heard, and create a conversation about the election in a public place. That&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>Second, it means that people can make one another hysterical with exaggerations, myths, or pure fabrications. Since anyone can write anything they want, misinformation can spread rather easily. Especially, when people are in a state of grief, they are particularly susceptible to hyperbole and over-dramatics.</p>
<p>Third, it means that people in a compromised state can say or do things that they will regret. But they are doing them publicly. This can make things awkward when they cool off.</p>
<p>I think that we need a little bit of advice on dealing with disappointment and grief. Fortunately, this week&#8217;s parsha is Chayei Sarah &#8211; the parsha where we learn about grief. Granted, Avraham was grieving for his beloved wife, but I am pretty sure some people loved Romney more than they loved their spouses, or at the very least, hate Obama enough to make it an apt comparison.</p>
<p>The Torah tells us that Sarah died and Avraham came to eulogize her and to cry for her. The next verse says that <em>&#8220;Avraham rose up from the presence of his deceased.</em>&#8221; (Genesis 23:3) Then Avraham went to negotiate a burial place for Sarah. The commentaries are bothered by the strange usage in verse 3. Why does the Torah say that Avraham &#8220;rose up&#8221;?</p>
<p>I once heard from Reb Yeruchem Levovitz that the Torah is telling us an important lesson in grief. So long as Avraham was grieving for his wife in private, it was acceptable, even laudable, Â for his emotions to be on his sleeve. But once he began dealing with outsiders in a potential business deal, Avraham had to leave those public emotions behind. Avraham had to &#8220;rise up&#8221; from his mood of public grief and put on his game face so that he could deal with the realities of life. Outward displays of grief have a way of weighing on others and making interactions uncomfortable for other people.</p>
<p>Avraham was in complete control of his emotions and when it was time to face the world, he kept his emotions in check.</p>
<p>I think this is great advice for mourning conservatives. I empathize with people who feel terrible about the election. But I do not empathize with YouTube screeds, public plans to move to Australia, fear mongering, sore loser complaints, or any other anti-social reaction to the election. I think we all have a responsibility to act civilly toward each other whether we win or we lose, whether we are elated or depressed.</p>
<p>To be fair, I think this applies equally to public displays of schadenfreude. But I have seen far less of that than I have seen meltdowns.</p>
<p>My last piece of advice is not to become too emotionally invested in things that are out of one&#8217;s control. Politics and sports are two areas where people place a tremendous amount of emotional energy. We are setting ourselves up for disappointment if we expect to win every time. We won&#8217;t. Reasonable people will disagree. Your political opponents are not (all) idiots. There&#8217;s enough room for an amalgamation of conservative and liberal views in our political system.</p>
<p>I chuckled at liberals who mourned in 2004 when Bush won his second term and I chuckle today when conservatives proclaim Obama&#8217;s reelection the end of America.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s learn the lesson of Avraham&#8217;s mourning. Pull yourself together and carry on with making a difference in the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nate-silver-hed-2012.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6433" title="nate-silver-hed-2012" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nate-silver-hed-2012-300x168.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>The election is over. Just over half of the country is happy with the results of the election. Just under half of the country is disappointed with the results of the election. No matter who won, some people would be happy and others would be sad. That&#8217;s just the reality of politics in America today.</p>
<p>However, there is one aspect of the election that should make everyone happy. By everyone, I mean whether you were rooting for Obama or Romney, you have the right to celebrate something.</p>
<p>Everyone should be celebrating with Nate Silver and <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight</a>.</p>
<p>To recap: Nate Silver confidently projected the outcome of the election nearly perfectly. This is not the first time he has done this. Silver has been blisteringly accurate in the two elections he has predicted. He came to politics by route of math and statistics, not policy and analysis. He was perfect last night as well.</p>
<p>While I am thrilled for Silver because he vindicated himself against the doubters (and the homophobes), I think his victory is a victory for all of us.<span id="more-6432"></span></p>
<p>Silver got his start in analyzing baseball statistics using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics" target="_blank">sabermetrics</a>. He sold his model to the premier sabermetrics website and then moved to politics. His methodologies leave very little room for chance and are based on hard mathematical analysis. Silver removes subjectivity and does not rely on logical fallacies in his projections. This is despite entrenched ideas and established trends in analysis. People don&#8217;t like him because he seems like a magician. He somehow knows what will happen without tapping into the usual prediction patterns and totems. This is why pundits could not understand Silver&#8217;s projections. They are speaking a different language. The old media is using grunts and hand motions, while Silver is speaking the Queen&#8217;s English. They didn&#8217;t even realize that Silver was not making <em>predictions</em>, he was issuing <em>projections</em>.</p>
<p>By analogy, baseball has long been a sport which can be predicted with incredible accuracy using statistics. This methodology is known at sabermetrics. It was the cornerstone of the the now-famous Moneyball system of Billy Beane. The idea is that some advanced statistics are more valuable than the &#8220;eye-test&#8221; or traditional statistics like RBI or even batting average. Finding players who produce good advanced statistics but do not produce good traditional statistics and getting those players for cheaper salaries because they are undervalued in the cornerstone of Moneyball. For many years, traditionalists have resisted sabermetrics. They don&#8217;t understand the math. They are jocks, not nerds. But slowly, advanced statistics are going mainstream. We are seeing more baseball people relying on good data as opposed to outdated and less valuable information.</p>
<p>With Silver&#8217;s incredible projections, it is clear that advanced statistics are going mainstream. This is a good thing for all of us. It means breaking down our biases and tendencies to see things the same old way and using math to see things more accurately. It will help society, a lot.</p>
<p>We need to rely less on accepted wisdom and more on science and math.</p>
<p>One correlation that I have seen is that skeptics who challenge conventional wisdom using science and math also exist in religious environment. These people don&#8217;t want to settle for fallacious arguments or accepted norms just because they are accepted norms. This manifests itself in orthodox Judaism with Daas Torah and people who challenge Daas Torah. The Nate Silvers of the world don&#8217;t accept arguments because of Appeal to Authority. The argument needs to stand on its own merits. It can be debated whether this is good for orthodox Jews or bad for orthodox Jews. However, I think it is clear that with the advent of sabertmetrics and fiverthirtyeight style projections that fewer people will be willing to submit themselves to an ephemeral concept like Daas Torah.</p>
<p>As always this leaves us with a choice. Do we double down on Daas Torah? Do we adjust Daas Torah and its expectations? Do we shutter Daas Torah?</p>
<p>Whichever we choose, let us hope that it is the right choice for the sake of truth and God.</p>

It&#8217;s a really great book and a full review is forthcoming. Something struck me as I was reading the book that is relevant to Israeli politics. In light of the UNGA I thought I would share my observations.</p>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles to peace in Israel is purportedly &#8220;the refugee problem&#8221;. Thousands of Arabs were displaced from their homes during the wars of 1948 and 1967. They hope to return to their homes which are now occupied by Israel. Those thousands of refugess have morphed into millions of refugees over the years.</p>
<p>InÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1616200405/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1616200405&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Aleppo Codex</a>, we learn one particular Jewish community in an Arab country, Aleppo Syria. As in many Arab countries, the Jews of Aleppo Syria dated back to Second Temple era over 2000 years ago. There were many ancient Jewish communities in Arab lands. Unlike the regular persecution threat to life that Jews experienced in Europe, many Jews in the Arab lands thrived as members of society. It is fascinating to read about a completely different social experience in the Arab lands than my personal history and heritage from the European lands.<span id="more-6293"></span></p>
<p>That all changed when the State of Israel was born. In response to the Jewish state, many citizens of Arab countries rioted and made life very uncomfortable for the Jews living in those countries. Although no one was killed in Aleppo, the Jews felt unsafe and had to flee. The same thing happened in other Arab countries. The Jewish homes were looted and Jews were forced to leave.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. Why is this never mentioned? The Palestinian refugees are not the only people who lost their homes when the State of Israel was granted to the Jewish people. All the Jewish communities in the Arab countries lost their homes as well! The entire Syrian community of Brooklyn and Deal, NJ is a big refugee camp. The Persian community of Los Angeles are a giant refugee camp too! And there are many others.</p>
<p>My point is quite simple. Yes, it is true that many Arabs lost their homes in 1948 and 1967. But hundreds of thousands of Jews lost their homes as well.</p>
<p>This means two things. Thousands of years of wandering has taught our people how to pack up and start over somewhere new. Not everyone is capable of doing this. Preventing people from starting over with [false] hope that they will get their homes back from half a century ago is a form of tyranny. It also means that any conversation about refugees &#8220;returning&#8221; should begin with a modest proposal that the Jews who were ousted from Arab lands get their homes back as well.</p>
<p>Like I said, the book is excellent. Check outÂ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1616200405/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1616200405&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Aleppo Codex: A True Story of Obsession, Faith, and the Pursuit of an Ancient Bible</a>Â and stay tuned for the full review.</p>
<p>In doing a little research for this post I came across this site:Â <a href="http://jewishrefugees.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://jewishrefugees.blogspot.com</a>. Check it out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/murder_mystery-puzzle.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6155" title="murder_mystery-puzzle" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/murder_mystery-puzzle-300x225.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>This summer has been a particularly violent summer in the USA. At least to my mind, there have been more reported acts of politicized public violence and mayhem than usual.</p>
<p>Aurora, the Sikh Temple, Texas A&amp;M, and now the Family Research Council, are all very public examples of gunmen and violence.</p>
<p>As with everything in life, there are many prisms with which to view this violence and its social ramifications. I have taken an interest in the reactions after the shootings. It seems that the most important thing to establish is whether the gunman was liberal or conservative. The next thing to do is to show how liberalism or conservatism is the reason that the gunmen killed innocent people. The next step is to proclaim the ideology of the gunmen an ideology of violence and barbarism.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see this from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>It reminds me of a similar exercise in futilty in debates between believers and non-believers. That argument usually follows the very logical path of analysis that attributes historical and contemporary violence to fervent religious beliefs. Events like the Inquisition, Crusades, and Â violence associated with Jihad are favorite examples used to prove this point.</p>
<p>In my opinion, all of these analyses are extremely superficial and contain numerous fallacies.<span id="more-6154"></span></p>
<p>Systematic killing is not a relevant discussion to sporadic violence. There is a systematic killing in some places in the world. It so happens that those places are third world countries that do not value life in the same way more civilized countries value life. So comparing militants in the Sudan to a shooter at the FRC in DC is a complete non-sequitur. Violent outbursts in modern society are not the same kind of killings as systematic killings which were mostly done for the sake of power or position and they leveraged religion to accomplish those goals. But that is not our concern. It does not tell us anything about violent martyrs who kill for a cause expecting to die.</p>
<p>The reason people kill other people is very complex. There are many factors that contribute to a human being taking the life of another. Certainly one needs motivation and political position or religious beliefs may provide motivation. But at its core, taking the life of another is an extremely anti-social behavior. It takes a specific kind of person to kill another, even for the sake of one&#8217;s beliefs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that an ideology can transform a normal functioning person into a sociopathic killer. The gap between &#8220;normal&#8221; and &#8220;murderer&#8221; is far too wide a gap to be crossed by adding <em>only</em> ideology. Further, let&#8217;s assume that less than .0001% of society murders other people. Meaning, for argument&#8217;s sake, one out of every one million people is a murderer. Personally, I think that is high, but let&#8217;s go with it. If religion or a specific political stance is so evil it causes murder, it is extremely ineffective at doing so. In other words, with so few murderers in society, it seems improbable to blame something as common as religion or political beliefs for murder.</p>
<p>Sure, many murderers hold extreme positions. But that is not whatÂ caused them to murder. Rather, the same thing that draws them to extremism is the thing that allows them to act in such an anti-social manner. To put it bluntly, people who kill other people are crazy. That is the starting point. Do crazy people believe in crazy things? Absolutely. But their beliefs are not what makes them crazy. Their beliefs are a symptom of their craziness, just as murder is a symptom of their craziness.</p>
<p>If there was no religion and if there were no politics, crazy people would still exist. And crazy people with access, opportunity, and motivation will sometimes kill other people.</p>
<p>So do me a favor. Please. Stop telling me about murderers who were socialists or liberals or libertarians or social conservatives or Christians, or Muslims, or Atheists, or Whatever. That is not relevant to their heinous murderous ways. People from all walks of life with all kinds of beliefs have been known to kill other people. More extreme groups will have more extreme people who have murderous tendencies. The beliefs don&#8217;t make them crazy, their craziness draws them to the beliefs.</p>
<p>The important thing that we should analyze about murderers is their mental health. We don&#8217;t need to eliminate religion or politics to stop murder in modern society, we need to deal with mental illness more aggressively and more effectively.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/spartan-warriors-2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5664" title="spartan-warriors-2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/spartan-warriors-2-300x204.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></a>This weekend, Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel granted Mishpacha Magazine an interview. I presume that when a orthodox Jewish publication interviews an orthodox Jewish public figure, the idea is to give the public figure an opportunity to set the record straight on any ambiguous issues and paint the public figure in a positive light. This is what makes this interview so odd. It didn&#8217;t quite work out that way.</p>
<p>Rabbi Zwiebel briefly addressed what has become a cornerstone issue for most sane people, sex abuse in the orthodox Jewish community. The expressly stated position of the Agudath Israel of America on this matter was ostensibly formed by the Moetzes Gedolei Yisroel. These Torah giants have determined that an orthodox Jew who is told about abuse should speak with a rabbi who in turn will advise them if they should proceed to the police. There is no central list of qualified rabbis to address this hairy question. Unluckily, Rabbi Zwiebel is constantly in the extremely difficult position of defending this position.</p>
<p>Invariably, Rabbi Zwiebel changes the discussion from the policy to the bloggers, or the falsely accused, or the assault of Daas Torah to deflect the criticism. It&#8217;s a poor strategy and it is not working. A couple weeks ago, an Agudah employee asked his Twitter followers and Facebook friends, I fit both categories, what Agudah could do to change the negative public perception about their abuse policy. I responded that they should change the policy. They haven&#8217;t. The point is that Agudah is aware of the public backlash.</p>
<p>The Mishpacha interview was more of the same and it spawned two very strident posts by my two favorite bloggers, <a href="http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2012/06/agudah-acknowledges-dropping-ball-on.html" target="_blank">Rabbi Slifkin</a> and <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2012/06/zweibel-paraphrased-better-thousand.html" target="_blank">DovBear</a>.<span id="more-5663"></span> When strident posts like theirs are written, the apologists take to the airwaves. In their best attempt to mete out measure for measure, the apologists counter attack. They call those who dare question the authority of the great rabbis heretics, rabble-rousers, angry, no longer orthodox, and a litany of other offenses.</p>
<p>What strikes me is that the apologists often wind up championing positions or ideas that those they are defending would not agree with. In other words, the rabbis these people are defending tooth and nail don&#8217;t necessarily agree with their world wide web warriors.</p>
<p>I can attest to this. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/27/why-is-the-internet-asifa-at-citifield-for-men-only/" target="_blank">When I questioned the folly of disallowing women from attending the Asifa</a>, I was called all kinds of names. But the truth was that the rabbis who these name callers were defending actually agreed with my position. They wanted the women to attend. I can&#8217;t be a jerk or kofer for suggesting the very thing that the rabbis wanted. When I questioned the wisdom of a one-size-fits-all Internet solution I was lambasted. I subsequently discovered that several Gedolim agreed with that position as well. How can I be a horrible person for agreeing with some of the Gedolim?</p>
<p>I think a little of the same thing happens when people attack Rabbi Slifkin and DovBear. The apologists take more hardline positions than those who they are defending. They invoke crazy <em>svaros</em> and obscure statements from earlier rabbis, that the ones whom they are defending would never use. Their positions are always more nuanced than their apologists. The other side of the same coin is that the dissenters oftentimes understand the position they take issue with as more extreme than it was intended.</p>
<p>Apologists come in many shapes and forms representing many ideologies and positions. In politics I see the same thing. Politicians from either side of the aisle are much more willing to compromise than their constituents. It&#8217;s easy to be an extremist fundamentalist when you have no responsibility or consequences to your actions. But when the fate of others rests in your hands, and you are a good person, you are going to consider more than your most fundamentalist position. Public policy, whether it is religious or political is usually a combination of compromises. There are no true socialists and no true capitalists in government. They realize that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I think the apologists for the Gedolim need to take a deep breath and realize that the American Gedolim generally do not choose extremist positions. Similarly, most of the educators in our schools are not as extreme or unreasonable as the <em>parents</em> of the children in their schools. We cannot Â allow the apologists and extremists to hijack or become the leaders of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>That being said, on the issue of abuse, the time has come for the Gedolim to really learn and appreciate what happens to victims of abuse. I honestly do not think they understand the gravity of the situation and perhaps if we educated them, their policy could change. If you would like to assist me or direct me in how to do this, please be in touch.</p>
<p>And for the record, my charedi poskim do not agree with the position of the Moetzes and they recommend going to the authorities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ying_yangredblue.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5630" title="ying_yangredblue" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ying_yangredblue.png" alt="" width="210" height="210" /></a>Despite the dearth of legitimate political debate on the airwaves, excellent political discourse can be found at dinner tables, bars, and Facebook walls. I don&#8217;t mean just conservatives and liberals debating traditional marriage vs. civil rights for gay people, or socialism vs. capitalism, or the merits of the death penalty. I am also talking about religious discourse. Arguments about the validity of religion, arguments over the rationality of atheism, debate within religions on the proper way to practice religion, debate within atheism as to what is the best way to be an atheist, take place on a regular basis with vigor and sometimes with surprising candor and logic.</p>
<p>Does anyone change their mind during these debates? Not really.</p>
<p>As an aside, I don&#8217;t think that means they are useless or a waste of time and energy. I think the goal of a conversation or debate is to discover the precise point of disagreement. This is useful because it helps the various sides understand exactly where the source of the argument lies. This can serve a very important role as it deflects the argument from becoming personal and it makes the argument less broad, creating Â more space for agreement.</p>
<p>But the question that we have to answer is if no one changes their mind after a debate how do we develop our leanings? In other words, clearly it cannot be based on logic as the points are subjective and well argued points have little sway on the other side of the debate, so if arguments don&#8217;t impact our political leanings, how did our opinions form in the first place?<span id="more-5629"></span></p>
<p>According to an article in the Guardian these leanings are deeply rooted in our psyches and are more nature than nurture, although nurture can effect nature. In other words, if you want to change your political beliefs, the only thing that you do is change your environment and who you associate with. If you want to change another person&#8217;s political beliefs, well, good luck. Our brains can even be wired for liberalism in some things and conservatism in other things. (That explains JewishÂ left wing modern orthodox republicans.)</p>
<p>All of this comes to a head when viewed through the prism of orthodox Judaism. There are liberal views and there are conservative views. Some people lean to the conservative views. Those are certainly the more popular views in orthodox Judaism over the last few decades. But what about the people who just don&#8217;t relate? The ones who find themselves gravitating towards liberal views within orthodox Judaism are often perceived as slackers, or looking for leniencies because they find the more conservative views too difficult or demanding. That may be true sometimes. I don&#8217;t think that is necessarily a bad thing or a criticism per se.</p>
<p>But I think that we can add this to the mix. Sometimes people are drawn to ideologies, even within their religion because of the way their brain is wired. Luckily, orthodox Judaism has legitimate conservative and liberal varieties of the religion. There is a place for everyone. We can&#8217;t squeeze out the people who are more comfortable with the less conservative views simply because the trend is to go in that direction. There needs too be room for all orthodox Jews in the spectrum to find meaning and satisfaction in orthodox Judaism and not feel marginalized by the dominant fundamentalists.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/reasonrallysca_reasonrally.png"><img class=" wp-image-5332 alignleft" title="reasonrallysca_reasonrally" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/reasonrallysca_reasonrally-300x243.png" alt="" width="240" height="194" /></a>At the Reason Rally last weekend Richard Dawkins plead with those in attendance to rid our world of religion. But it wasn&#8217;t enough to preach to the choir (hehe) and reaffirm their atheist beliefs. Dawkins urged the 20,000 in attendance to ridicule religion and show contempt for religion.</p>
<p>This is further than previous calls to action by atheists. It used to be enough to challenge believers to debate, publish books and articles, but now Dawkins wants atheists to verbally attack religious people. Let me get right out and say it, this is really really bad idea.<span id="more-5330"></span></p>
<p>Now, I do sympathize with many of the ideas that Dawkins teaches. I think that politics and government policy should not be decided by religious beliefs. This is not because I think religious beliefs are inherently bad or wrong, in fact, I am in favor of many religious beliefs. I am a religious person myself. I think religion can and should play a strong an important role in our lives. But I don&#8217;t think it is fair or correct for one particular religion to rule our thinking and public policy. Every religion has mutually exclusive beliefs and all religious beliefs are exclusive of atheist beliefs. Our government should not favor one over the other. On this, Dawkins and I somewhat agree.</p>
<p>But now Dawkins is pushing harder. He is no longer simply concerned with eliminating religious beliefs from government, he wants to eliminate religion. Period. Not only does he want to eliminate religion but he wants atheists to be confrontational and to mock religious people.</p>
<p>There are a few problems with this proposal.</p>
<p>First of all, in my experience very little comes from confrontation. Most people reinforce their beliefs when confronted or ridiculed.</p>
<p>Second of all, if the platform of atheist is reason and rationality then mocking others hardly reinforces that notion. Stick to your principles, don&#8217;t resort to bully tactics.</p>
<p>Third of all (and most importantly), there is nothing wrong with people holding religious beliefs! People are free to believe as they choose. Several studies and talks discuss the importance of religion in people&#8217;s lives even if it would be shown to be false! The issue is not whether people should believe in God or hold religious beliefs. The issue is whether those beliefs should play a prominent role in a melting-pot society. There are excellent arguments to be made on both sides of that issue. Ridicule is not an argument.</p>
<p>Frankly, I am disappointed by this development. Hopefully, atheists and believers can come together to create the best possible society for everyone; a world free of mockery and ridicule.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/6a00d8341c7de353ef0167621b37c0970b-600wi.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5159" title="6a00d8341c7de353ef0167621b37c0970b-600wi" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/6a00d8341c7de353ef0167621b37c0970b-600wi-300x216.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="216" /></a>Let&#8217;s assume for sake of this post that Obamacare is constitutional on its face. That is, there is no problem requiring all citizens to have insurance. I don&#8217;t think this is necessarily the case, but this issue will be decided in the courts over the next year or so. The more interesting question for people of religion is whether the requirement that employers insure their employees and provide all women with free access to birth control pills is a violation of the first amendment or more provocatively, if is an &#8220;attack against religion&#8221;.</p>
<p>To start, some math. The government is an insurer. With or without Obamacare. This is because the government provides public health care for many people. The poor, the elderly, and others all get their health care paid for by the government. Insurance costs have risen higher than the inflation rate. One proposed reason for this is because uninsured people weigh down the system. At this point there are three choices. One choice is to continue on this path and provide care to the uninsured without a plan to pay for it. The second choice is to cut off the uninsured and deny them care unless they pay up front. The third choice is to create a comprehensive plan to lower the cost and insure everybody. Obama has chosen choice number three as have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care" target="_blank">many other countries across the world</a>.</p>
<p>Choice three requires that costs be lowered. One useful tool in keeping health care costs down is to provide free birth control. This is a mathematical fact. It sounds crude and unkind. But it is true. Unwanted pregnancies are bound to happen in a free society and even if we all agree that it is amoral to engage in activities that can create an unwanted pregnancy that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that they still occur. Providing birth control to everyone helps alleviate this burden.</p>
<p>That is the math. It is not a decision by secularists to force people to stop having religious babies. It is an economic decision.</p>
<p>That being said, we need to analyze whether an unintended result of this policy is offensive or even an attack against religious people.</p>
<p><span id="more-5158"></span></p>
<p>The Pope declared that <em>using</em> birth control is proscribed by God. In Catholicism, the Pope has this authority. Under the current rules, Catholics do not need to use birth control. They don&#8217;t have to pick it up at the pharmacy. They can pretend it doesn&#8217;t exist for all anyone care. Although, according to the statistics 98% of Catholic women have used birth control and 78% believe one can be a good Catholic and use birth control.</p>
<p>The next issue is whether a Catholic person or institution can be required to pay for birth control on behalf of others. This is where it gets sticky. Technically speaking, Catholics, like most other religions believe that everyone has to listen to their laws, not just Catholics. Their view, like most religions, is that salvation or nirvana or perfection comes through their laws and lifestyle. Therefore, paying for others to use birth control sort of delays this process. It impedes their progress towards a world of perfection, ie Catholics. Thus, in this manner of speaking, the requirement that employers provide and pay for insurance that covers birth control is a type of violation of the religious beliefs of Catholics.</p>
<p>The problem with this view is that it enters extremely dangerous territory. It is impossible for the government to accommodate all religious views and hopes for world domination. Without getting into specifics, every religion has beliefs that concern some Utopian period where their laws are supreme. It is impossible to reconcile all these laws with government policy.</p>
<p>Religions have and will continue to focus on their adherents and instruct them to follow the laws of their particular religion. But religions must keep their Utopian beliefs between each other and cannot expect the world to cow to beliefs that impose on others or that dictate how others, outside their religion should act. Finally, the government is not to be used as a tool to manipulate the citizens of the country into neatly adhering to a particular religious beliefs. The government should not play any role in assisting religions achieving their goals of religious superiority.</p>
<p>The argument over birth control has become politicized. It is no longer about religious freedom, rather it has become an exercise in controlling birth control.</p>
<p>Finally, I find it odd that orthodox Jewish groups have aligned themselves with those who are against the birth control provision. I already wrote about that on DovBear a couple months ago: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2011/12/ou-and-agudah-unite-against.html" target="_blank">OU and Agudah Unite Against Contraceptives</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion-and-politics2.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5104" title="religion-and-politics2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/religion-and-politics2.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Politicians from the Right often cite God or Jesus as a basis for political positions. Some even make the claim that they are running for office upon the advise of God Himself.</p>
<p>Now, it is impossible for God to have told more than one particular person that they are destined to be the next president. So either all but one are lying or they are all lying. You decide.</p>
<p>Either way, the whole concept of appealing to God&#8217;s authority in politics is very silly. The reason it is silly is because none of these people have had any specific revelation. Rather, they apply their interpretations of ancient texts, or worse, their personal feelings or emotional stirrings and claim that these are Divine messages. What makes matters even fuzzier is that politicians are usually businessmen or lawyers. They are notÂ theologiansÂ or members of the clergy. Their understanding of their own religions is as basic as the average American&#8217;s understanding of their religions. Their understanding of other religions is even poorer.</p>
<p>Case in point: President Obama invoked the teachings of Jesus as a basis for taxes. The response has been vicious. Most of theÂ criticismÂ has been because of the seeming transparent pandering to the religious voters. This is a valid criticism. But only to a point. Politicians are professional panderers. We just don&#8217;t like it when <em>we can tell</em>.</p>
<p>The more important point, that is being overlooked, is how religious beliefs are able to conform to political positions.Â <span id="more-5102"></span>It&#8217;s too easy to make an argument for almost any predetermined position using religious faith or texts. The stories are obscure, the analogies are tenuous and the bias is overwhelming. It&#8217;s to the point that I can&#8217;t take any appeal to religion seriously. Further, not everyone <em>wants </em>to follow the teachings of Jesus. Those same teachings were used as a tool for death and destruction for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Are taxes some form of charity, as Obama suggests? Maybe. But religion is not going to provide the answer to that question.</p>
<p>Political policy should be based on reasoning that is free from religious influence. It should not be guided by love for God or religion nor should it be guided by disbelief in God or hatred for religion.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t blame politicians. I blame the religious fervor of American citizens that demands that their politicians double as religious leaders. It&#8217;s foolish to assume that politicians know enough about religion to have intelligent opinions on theological matters. We should stop demanding it. Along the same lines, we should not turn to one specific version of a religion to solve our problems or as a basis for setting policy. At best, it is silly and at worse it is offensive.</p>
<p>I think the other speaker at the event at which the president spoke had good advice. Eric Metaxas suggested we remove phony religiosity from public discourse. Since it is all phony, I say we remove it all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/newt-2012.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4903" title="newt-2012" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/newt-2012-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>GOP Candidate and Presidential hopeful, Newt Gingrich has made headlines with his recent claim that the Palestinians are an Invented People. The responses from across the idealogical and political spectrum have been as wild and varied as to be expected.</p>
<p>On one extreme, representatives of the Palestinians fired back at Gingrich. In a statement, they called Gingrich racist and said that his was the worst kind of insult that would only help the cycle of violence. On the other extreme are those nodding their heads in agreement at the prospect of a President who agrees with their perspective on the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the fact-checkers have confirmed and debunked Gingrich&#8217;s claim. There is evidence that the Palestinians existed as a small subgroup in the land that is currently Israel. However, there is little evidence that they had any sense of national pride or unity as a group before the State of Israel was established.</p>
<p>What strikes me is how silly this whole thing is.<span id="more-4902"></span> Gingrich&#8217;s comment could be equally said about a myriad of nations and peoples. It could really be said about anybody! What qualifies a nation as a &#8220;non-invented&#8221; people? How long do those people need to be where they are to be considered legitimate?</p>
<p>Is the United States of America not invented? Is the United Kingdom not Invented? Is Mexico not invented? Even historically ethnic countries such as Japan or Sweden are practically speaking &#8220;invented&#8221;. They lived in close proximity for a long time and eventually created a sense of national pride and unity. But they were not magically granted the land in which they live by some objective method of determining land division. Clearly land is not given only to nations who are not invented.</p>
<p>Further, let&#8217;s assume for a second that Gingrich is correct. The Palestinians are invented and invented people don&#8217;t get land. Now what? What are you going to do about it? Nuke the West Bank? Manufacture a tsunami and drown Gaza? There are millions of these so-called invented people. What now? Point being, invented or not, there is an issue that needs to be dealt with. By simply saying they are invented does nothing to resolve that issue. In fact, it probably has the opposite effect. It entrenches both sides and polarizes the parties.</p>
<p>And what about Gingrich himself? He is a Catholic. Is that an invented religion? If it is not, well that means that all other religions are invented. So are they all not granted the right to exist simply because they are invented? Everything is invented. Mazel tov.</p>
<p>Which brings us full circle. Gingrich said that Palestinians are an invented people simply to anger some people and excite others. It was a political statement that carries less meaning than most political statements. It is the kind of broad brushed, meaningless statement for which politics is famous.</p>
<p>I think the voting public would prefer to hear about solutions to a decades long conflict instead of whimsical platitudes. I wonder if Gingrich has any ideas for the conflict or if he can&#8217;t be bothered to deal with invented people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/edison-light-bulb.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4426" title="edison-light-bulb" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/edison-light-bulb-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>The light bulb. Simple, effective technology. No programming, no complicated installation, no software. Just flick a switch and &#8220;behold, there is light&#8221;.</p>
<p>Light bulbs are a hot topic these days. Four years ago, President Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security act of 2007. One provision in the Act required that all light bulbs meet a certain threshold of efficiency. In effect this excludes the old-fashioned, gets really hot to the touch, don&#8217;t shake it lest you break the filament light bulb.</p>
<p>Efficiency requirements are no strangers to Federal law. Your car is subject to specific Federal efficiency requirements as well.</p>
<p>The benefits of the bill were noted in 2007. Namely, the overall cost of energy efficient bulbs will save Americans tons of money and due to their much longer lifetime reduce overall production costs and also reduce the negative affect on the environment.<span id="more-4424"></span></p>
<p>These benefits come at a cost as well. The energy efficient bulbs are usually CFLs (compact flourescents) that are more toxic if they shatter and are more expensive to produce in the short term.</p>
<p>This has sparked a debate regarding the benefits and harms of the bill.</p>
<p>A bill to overturn the 2007 Act has been proposed by a Republican Representitive from Texas. His contention is not that incandescents are superior to CFLs. His contention is that the government should not (may not) tell its citizens what kind of light bulbs to buy. It is a personal freedom issue.</p>
<p>I tend to agree that the government should not interfere with citizens rights. But I resent what has become of this debate.</p>
<p>First of all, the government already regulates effiiency standards in other industries. Regulating light bulbs is no more an affront to liberty than an emissions test before registering a vehicle.</p>
<p>Second of all, the debate has become partisan and is no longer about what is best for people and the environment. It is about conservatives vs. liberals. This is unfortunate. What has happened is that the talking points for overturning the bill, big government, personal freedom etc., are being used as reasons to go out and buy inefficient bulbs.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is stupid. Even according to those who oppose the government telling us what kind of light bulbs to buy, if CFLs are more energy and cost efficient then it would wise to buy them. If we are supposed to have faith in the market, and CFLs are better for the market, then the market should buy these bulbs. But since it has become a matter of principle supporters of the new bid to overturn the 2007 bill are fanatically buying the worse bulbs!</p>
<p>For starters, this supports the argument for a nanny state. If people are too dumb to do the right thing then maybe the government should get involved. The best way to support overturning the EISA would be to buy the more efficient bulbs without government interference. It is NOT by creating a grassroots effort to buy the wrong bulbs.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the new bill will pass. I also think the new bulbs should be supported by conservatives, liberals and libertarians alike. All the information I have seen indicates that these are a better technology and are, better for the environment and wallet long term.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_4405" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 305px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/JaniceHahnSm.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4405" title="JaniceHahnSm" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/JaniceHahnSm-295x300.jpg" alt="" width="295" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Janice Hahn</p></div>
<p>Without getting to far afield in the nitty gritty of the local politics, there is an election for a seat in Congress representing the 36th Congressional District on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Democratic candidate is Janice Hahn. She appeared to be a shoo-in for the seat in a fairly moderate to liberal district. One particular issue has turned the tides of the race and created a virtual heat heading into the final weekend.</p>
<p>The issue (this is as &#8220;neutral point of view&#8221; I can put it) is Hahn&#8217;s policies with regard to gang members. In particular she facilitated the placement of criminals as gang interventionists and had them paid via a third party.</p>
<p>It is hard for me to see how this is being portrayed negatively. Or more to the point, why this is being portrayed negatively. <span id="more-4404"></span>The biggest crime issue in Los Angeles is gangs. One of the more effective ways of curbing gang violence is negotiating peace treaties. I met the fellow who negotiated the truce between the Bloods and Crips. It took almost 10 years to form an agreement. (His name is Aquila Sherrils.) Hahn enlisted the help of some senior gang members to negotiate for peace between gangs. These representatives were paid by football legend Jim Brown&#8217;s foundation. She also strongly supported programs to help gang members receive recognition for changing their lives. All of this seems very good.</p>
<p>Yet, Fox LA ran a nearly 10 minute segment on Janice Hahn&#8217;s &#8220;horrifying&#8221; involvement with gang members. The bias and slant in this report is embarrassing (for them) and an indictment on the public. If the public does not want to see programs and initiative such as Ms. Hahn&#8217;s what do they want? If working from within gangs to promote peace treaties is a bad idea, what is a good idea? If it is seen as a blemish on ones record for thinking creatively and bravely about how to solve the gang problems what would a sparkling record look like?</p>
<p>This report has me so upset at Fox, the public and the organizers of Hahn&#8217;s opponent&#8217;s campaign who are text messaging the entire district about this horrible report. Note, the report makes no accusations of wrongdoing or impropriety. It is simply the concept that Hahn is helping gang members that is so obscene that it renders her am unqualified conduct. As one website promoting Hahn&#8217;s indiscretions put it: Hahn is directing public funds to &#8220;support violent, inner-city criminals&#8221;.<br />
Disgraceful.</p>
<p>Tell me what you think.</p>
<p>(Sorry, whoever uploaded this video squished everybody&#8230;)</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: I do not endorse or support any candidate in this race. This blog post is for information purposes only. I am not saying I agree with Hahn on this issue. I am saying that the way she is being portrayed as a villain for doing good work is very disturbing to me.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/10034530_I-Want-You-for-the-US-Army-c1917.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3808" title="US Army I Want You" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/10034530_I-Want-You-for-the-US-Army-c1917-226x300.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="300" /></a>During the Super Bowl I wrote one tweet about the ads. It got a lot of notoriety. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/02/08/the-tweet-that-made-me-famous-and-what-i-meant-by-it/">The Tweet That Made Me Famous (and what I meant by it)</a>) But there was another tweet I had about the ads which I didn&#8217;t publish. Instead I made a real life comment to a fellow human being (my wife). (<em>One of the problems with social media is that sometimes we type what we should be saying and we stunt our human interactions. So I try not to tweet if there is a human who can appreciate my observations&#8230;</em>)</p>
<p>Anyway, what I didn&#8217;t tweet was an observation about some ads during the Super Bowl for the Marines. As you know, those ads are pretty pricey. About $2 million a pop. So I was surprised when I saw (I think) two ads for the Marines during the Super Bowl. That&#8217;s $4 million tax dollars recruiting for the Marines.<span id="more-3807"></span></p>
<p>I was a little surprised and little disappointed. I was surprised because the ads are so expensive and disappointed because I wasn&#8217;t happy to see millions of tax dollars spent on an advertisement when the government is supposed to be cutting spending on social programs. Especially when the ones wh0 want to make the cuts are Republicans and they are also the ones who support spending on the military.</p>
<p>It bothered me. But not enough for a blog post. Then there were some votes in Congress.</p>
<p>In one day (February 18, 2011) the House voted to block Federal Aid for Planned Parenthood because there Planned ParenthoodÂ has been linked to [<em>legal</em>] abortions. Planned Parenthood was receiving a lot of aid. They will now receive none. Planned Parenthood is following the law and the Supreme Court has held that legal abortions could receive Federal funding.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tough to see an important social organization lose their funding, but with a budget crisis it seems inevitable that some programs will be cut. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I think Planned Parenthood serves an important Federal interest and should receive funding for all activities that the law permits. But, if there is no money, I understand they are a non-essential organization and could be privately funded so they lose their money.</p>
<p>But then on the same day, the House voted to approve a sponsorship of a Nascar team by the US Army. Now, I&#8217;m no fool, I know that the money to Planned Parenthood is much more significant than the money going to Nascar. But how does it look when you&#8217;re cutting funding to non-essential organizations like Planned Parenthood and giving it to even less essential places like Nascar!?</p>
<p>Between the Super Bowl ads for the Marines, the Nascar sponsorship and all the other billboards, TV ads and other marketing for the US Defense Forces, there is a lot of money at stake. The Federal government has no problem spending all that money.</p>
<p>Seeing that, I decided it was worth a blog post.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re trimming the fat, you need to trim all the fat. Not just the fat that others are enjoying (remember in this analogy, fat is a &#8220;good&#8221; thing) while you leave the fat on for yourself&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>I was less upset about the ads for the car companies that received bailouts from the Federal government. Those ads are part showing the world that the bailouts worked (<em>whether they did or not is not relevant, the Big 3 have a right to try to convince the public that their Federally sponsored product is worth buying</em>).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sarah_palin.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3299" title="sarah_palin" src="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sarah_palin-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a>Things weren&#8217;t looking so good for Sarah Palin a couple years ago. What with the lost election, her daughter&#8217;s teenage pregnancy and some clothing scandal, it seemed Palin was destined for the waste bin of history. Easy come, easy go.</p>
<p>But Palin took some time off. Then she let the people become dissatisfied with their government and as President Obama did in 2008, Palin capitalized of the country&#8217;s yearning for change. Palin endorsed some long-shot candidates in the 2010 mid-term elections and some of them won, while others did not. The election was not a sweep for Palin, it was more like a draw.</p>
<p>But today&#8217;s news is a definite win for Palin. Two wins in fact.<span id="more-3297"></span></p>
<p>Win #1: Sarah Palin&#8217;s Alaska is a brand new reality based TV show on TLC. I have not seen the show. I hear it is about Sarah Palin&#8217;s outdoor excursions including bear watching, fishing and other activities that are normal for Alaskans and boring for me&#8230; Anyway, the show pulled in a 4.96 rating. In English, that means that nearly 5 million people tuned in to see Palin and her TV show. That set a new record for TLC and is being called a whopping success. The show runs for another 7 weeks and we will need to monitor its long range ratings to see if it is really a success or a one hit wonder.</p>
<p>Win #2: Remember when everyone was making fun of Sarah Palin for inadvertently inventing a word in a twitter message (tweet)? Here is the text of the original tweet:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Ground Zero Mosque supporters: doesn&#8217;t it stab you in the heart, as it does ours throughout the heartland? Peaceful Muslims, pls <strong>refudiate</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a screengrab of the tweet:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bits-palin-blogSpan.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3298" title="Palin's refudiate tweet" src="http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/bits-palin-blogSpan.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="224" /></a></p>
<p>A few hours later the tweet was deleted and the word refudiate was replaced with refute (which is still not proper usage of the word, but at least it&#8217;s a word!).</p>
<p>As I type the word refudiate in this blog post, a red dotted line appears beneath it. Know why? Because it&#8217;s not a word. But that all changed today. Eventually my computer&#8217;s dictionary will get the memo (I hope).</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.oup.com/2010/11/refudiate-2/" target="_blank">Oxford Word of the Year</a> is&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. Refudiate.</p>
<p>Really.</p>
<p>So, feel free to use refudiate in professional conversation. It&#8217;s perfectly legit.</p>
<p>Two big wins for Sarah Palin in one day.</p>
<p>Now I am just waiting for the Democrats to refudiate the Oxford Dictionary for supporting Sarah Palin&#8230;  <img src='http://finkorswim.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>For the full list of words added to the 2010 Oxford Dictionary see the NY Times technology blog: <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/a-twitter-flub-becomes-a-word-of-the-year/?src=busln" target="_blank">Bits</a></p>

<p>When the proposal reached the Litchfield planning board the center was denied.</p>
<p>The reasons cited by the board were mostly aesthetic. &#8220;The doors will be too big&#8221;, &#8220;The building will be a monstrosity compared to our small quaint homes&#8221;, &#8220;The Star of David may not comply with the historic district&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>Fueling the tensions are claims that the opposition to the center is anti-Semitic.<span id="more-2854"></span></p>
<p>Without drawing comparisons to Park51 (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/08/18/ground-zero-mosque-vs-downtown-manhattan-islamic-cultural-center-video-debate/">Ground Zero Mosque vs. Downtown Manhattan Islamic Cultural Center: Video Debate</a>)Â or the Maghen Abraham Synagogue in Lebanon (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/09/15/maghen-abraham-synagogue-in-beirut-lebanon-a-symbol-of-tolerance/">Maghen Abraham Synagogue in Beirut Lebanon: A Symbol of Tolerance</a>), the issues raised in the spat are issues that go to the heart of religion in America.</p>
<p>In America, Religion is tolerated. In America, if yours is not the dominant religion, please keep to yourselves and don&#8217;t impose on the rest of us. In America, religion is okay so long as it is not &#8220;in my face&#8221;.</p>
<p>But for the dominant religion? In your face is totally fine. Prayers before sporting events, political policy in the name of &#8220;religion&#8221; and even laws that are rooted in a very specific Christian understanding of the bible are all part and parcel of the &#8220;American Experience&#8221;.</p>
<p>My opinion: Less &#8220;In Your Face&#8221; Religion from everyone would be quite welcome. Christopher Hitchens talks about the modernization of religion. This is vital to living in a world with more than one acceptanle viewpoint and especially when a competing viewpoint is right around the virtual corner. Religion can no longer be bully, it needs to place nice with the global community and respect all traditions and religions, even those who have neither.</p>
<p>I am no fan of blocking a Synagogue. Especially if and when it is fueled by anti-Semitism, but if it were me building the synagogue, I would try to fit into the aesthetic character of the community as best as I possibly could and be as unobtrusive as possible.</p>
<p>So, I choose neither side in this battle&#8230;</p>

<p>It seems that the Cordoba House in downtown Manhattan has cleared a major hurdle by winning a 9-0 vote of the Landmarks Conservation Commission. (NY Times <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/mosque-near-ground-zero-clears-key-hurdle/?hp" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>Conservatives and liberals seem to be at loggerheads on this particular issue. Sarah Palin made headlines with her plea that the center be blocked and fellow right wing pundits have expressed their distaste to the center. They feel it disgraces the deceased by glorifying what they believe to be the religion that caused the tragedy at Ground Zero almost 9 years ago. Liberals, on the other hand, see the center as an olive branch to Islam and think the center glorifies America, not the dangerous form of Islamic Fundamentalism that took down the Twin Towers, 3000 victims and the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say whether the center is an affront or not.<span id="more-2689"></span> That&#8217;s because it varies with each person. Everyone is free to react as they choose. I can&#8217;t say one side is right and one side is wrong.</p>
<p>What I can say is that the center has a bad marketing plan.</p>
<p>The center is not a mosque. It is a massive cultural center. There is a sanctuary planned but it is a minor part of a broader institution. An institution that, according to their website attempts to bring the gap between Islam and the West. An institution that also fights for women&#8217;s rights and opportunitities within Islam. In fact, if we are to believe the Cordoba website, it is exactly what Americans (especially Conservatives) should be supporting.</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cordoba House is a Muslim-led project which will build a world-class facility that promotes tolerance, reflecting the rich diversity of New York City.Â  The center will be community-driven, serving as a platform for inter-community gatherings and cooperation at all levels, providing a space for all New Yorkers to enjoy.</p>
<p>This proposed project is about promoting integration, tolerance of difference and community cohesion through arts and culture.Â  Cordoba House will provide a place where individuals, regardless of their backgrounds, will find a center of learning, art and culture; and most importantly, a center guided by Islamic values in their truest form &#8211; compassion, generosity, and respect for all.</p>
<p>The site will contain tremendous amounts of resources that otherwise would not exist in Lower Manhattan; a 500-seat auditorium, swimming pool, art exhibition spaces, bookstores, restaurants &#8211; all these services would form a cultural nexus for a region of New York City that, as it continues to grow, requires the sort of hub that Cordoba House will provide.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why call themselves a mosque? Bad marketing.</p>
<p>The center is not &#8220;at Ground Zero&#8221; either. It is 2 blocks away. If you&#8217;ve never been to Manhattan you can&#8217;t appreciate how FAR part 2 blocks in NYC are. Two blocks in Manhattan is very far. It is a few minutes walk and more importantly, it is certainly not within the line of sight. They should be saying that their center is a few minutes walk from Ground Zero. Not &#8220;at Ground Zero&#8221;.</p>
<p>From their website:</p>
<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ch_map1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2690" title="Cordoba Location" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/ch_map1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>So the Mosque at Ground Zero is neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero. It is an Islamic Center in Downtown Manhattan. Is that still as offensive to those who oppose the center?</p>
<p>The only reasonable explanation for opposition that remains is conspiracy.</p>
<p>In other words, the website is a sham. The REAL purpose of Cordoba House is to spread Fundamental Islam and serve as a springboard for the continued spread of Islam in their quest for world dominance. This is Islamaphobia.</p>
<p>There are people who believe this to be the case. I do not.</p>
<p>If you are asking me, which you aren&#8217;t, I say support the Cordoba House and the brand of Islam they espouse and perhaps get involved a see it for yourself if you are not convinced. Working together will go a long way.</p>

<p>When asked about the Arizona Immigration Law &#8211; state Senate Bill 1070, by ESPN.com columnist J.A. Adande, Jackson raised a few eyebrow. In fact he raised enough eyebrows that a protest is planned for tonight&#8217;s game at Staples Center in Downtown LA.</p>
<p>The LA Times has a full report here: <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/05/activists-protest-lakers-coach-phil-jackons-comments-on-arizonas-new-immigration-law.html">Activists protest Lakers Coach Phil Jackson&#8217;s comments on Arizona&#8217;s new immigration law</a></p>
<p>What did Jackson say that set off the protesters?<span id="more-2475"></span></p>
<p>During their Playoffs Series against the San Antonio Spurs, the Suns wore Jerseys that paid tribute to the Latino community by tweaking the name of the team from Suns to Los Suns. That this is somehow a strong political statement is a stretch in my mind. Some people (including the players) felt that by wearing Los Suns on their jersey it was somehow a protest against the law. I don&#8217;t see it that way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Adande asked Jackson what he thought about the Suns political statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>First Jackson, who has showed lefty leanings in the past, indicated he had no problem with the controversial state Senate Bill 1070.</p>
<p><em>âAm I crazy, or am I the only one that heard [the legislature] say âwe just took the United States immigration law and adapted it to our state,ââ</em> Jackson said.</p>
<p>I told him they usurped the federal law.</p>
<p><em>âItâs not usurping, itâs just copying it is what they said they did, and then they gave it some teeth to be able to enforce it,â</em> Jackson said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I feel exactly like Jackson. Am I crazy?</p>
<p>When the bill was passed the NY Times had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Arizona is the first state to demand that immigrants meet <strong>federal requirements</strong> to carry identity documents legitimizing their presence on American soil. (Full article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html" target="_blank">here</a>.) (emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p>The law just enforces a Federal Requirement. Uncle Righteous (that&#8217;s Coach Jackson&#8217;s other nickname) is just standing up for Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>So Jackson is right. Yet the law has set off a firestorm. Why? I can think of a lot of reasons. But it seems misguided to take out your anger on Phil Jackson, or even the state of Arizona! This a Federal Regulation!</p>
<p>Anyway, I digress. There are two things I want to mention.</p>
<p>First, Adande makes a foolish assumption. He assumes that if a man is a Democrat or a liberal then he falls in line and supports every single policy of fellow Democrats. The money quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>That was surprising to hear coming from a man who not only supported Bill Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination, he wore a Bradley campaign pin on his suit during games.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is it surprising? Each issue has its merits and demerits. Why must we be pigeonholed once we hold one way in one issue that now in every other issue our opinion is pre-determined!? This bothers me a lot. Jackson has every right to feel one way on one issue and side with &#8220;liberals&#8221; Â and on other issues side with &#8220;conservatives&#8221;. If not, we cease to think and become party line robots.</p>
<p>Finally, sports and politics don&#8217;t mix. To me that means that an athlete or sportswriter or coach can have an opinion but it is not nearly as valuable as their relative expertise on sports. Is Jackson influential in political spheres? Absolutely not. So why protest his statements? Let the guy coach basketball and ignore everything else that he says.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I do&#8230;</p>

<p>If you are like me, you have been reading about the Rubashkin saga for months. What began with a Federal raid at a meat processing plant to ferret out hundreds of illegal alien employees is now culminating with a federal and state trial.<a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/anti-semitic-poster1.jpg"> (</a><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26626858" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing that the raid was &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; and fueled by anti-semitism.</p>
<div>
<p>If you are like me you have been hearing that he was denied bail because of an anti-semitic fear that Rubashkin was a flight risk and would flee to Israel.</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing that his federal sentencing recommendation was anti-semitic. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/us/29postville.html" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing how the county jail was anti-semitic in not providing food that was kosher &#8220;to Rubashkin&#8217;s standards&#8221; and not permitting him to wear religious garb (tzitzis / tzitzit). (<a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20100509/NEWS/5090342/Rubashkin-dispute-highlights-faith-issue" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>I have three things I want to say.<span id="more-2466"></span></p>
<p>1) I feel terribly for Rubashkin. I feel terribly for any criminal who is sentenced to prison but more-so when the criminal is a family member of mine. As a fellow Jew, Rubashkin is family and it pains me to see him in this state. I support asking for leniency is a mentshlach way.</p>
<p>2) Rubashkin is the cause of much of the animosity towards him from the prosecution and judiciary. It is NOT, I repeat, NOT because he is Jewish, nor is it anti-semitic.</p>
<p>3) Even those who cry anti-semitism in this case are grossly misusing the term.</p>
<p>I think #1 is a well represented opinion throughout the Jewish community. It does not require any more attention from me. Consider me to have said &#8220;ditto&#8221;.</p>
<p>Number 2 is something that has been so wildly misunderstood it almost seems blatant. The reason Rubashkin&#8217;s plant was raided was NOT due to a plan hatched in the bowels of a Ku Klux Klan facility. The reason his plant was raided was because he snubbed the Unions by hiring illegals and the Unions were none-too-happy. They made the infractions known to the Feds and they raided the plant. Were there too many helicopters and fancy weapons? Probably. Was it anti-semitic? Probably not. The people who make these kinds of choices don&#8217;t, actually, CAN&#8217;T have vendettas against minorities. This is the Federal Government of the most benevolent host the Jewish people have ever had. Use your noodle people! There is no conspiracy! Who was president at the time? Our best friend George W. Bush. The federal agents were in his employ. Dare we think that the &#8220;anti-semitic raid&#8221; was orchestrated by our dear friend? Of course not.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Rubashkin was considered a flight-risk because agents found $10,000 cash in a packed bag with passports. Under normal circumstances that is a flight-risk. A packed bag with cash and passports could be reasonably interpreted as a &#8220;just-in-case&#8221; bag. Maybe it was a &#8220;just-in-case Moshiach comes bag&#8221;. I am willing to believe that was the case. But what would you think if you saw that bag and he wasn&#8217;t a frum Jew? Is it anti-semitism to draw the logical conclusion from finding that bag and denying him bail? Certainly not.</p>
<p>The sentencing recommendation was well within Federal guidelines. I was talking about the case to a lawyer friend of mine who works for the Court of Appeals and who knew nothing about the case. I told him some of the facts about the bank fraud. His immediate reaction was, &#8220;that&#8217;s a life sentence&#8221;. He didn&#8217;t know the crook was a Jew. He didn&#8217;t know the crook was accused of other crimes. He only knew about the bank fraud and he said &#8220;that&#8217;s a life sentence&#8221;. Is he anti-semitic? Who cares?! He didn&#8217;t know the cases involved a Jew when he said a life sentence was what the crook deserved!</p>
<p>Also, much has been made of &#8220;comparable criminals&#8221;. It is an unfair comparison because Rubashkin has not been cooperative. He was not willing to accept any plea deals. He maintains his complete, 100% innocence and is a difficult person for the court to deal with. He has many special requests and claims he is being victimized. He has offered only one half-baked apology since this saga began and has not taken any responsibility.</p>
<p>While in jail, Rubashkin has made special requests. Some have been honored and some have not. Some of the requests that have been honored and he has stated that he not satisfied with the kashrus of the food. It is kosher, just not kosher enough. Is it anti-semitic if they give him kosher food that most orthodox Jews would eat?</p>
<p>Also, Rubashkin will not walk without wearing Tzitzis. He states that his religion will not allow him to walk. So he has been carried around so that he will not violate this religious law. The problem is that he is with ignorant of the law or is just trying to be annoying. The law is that when one wears a four-cornered garment (think of a poncho or rectangular wrap) the garment must have a certain formula of strings attached to the garment at the corners. One is not required to wear such a garment. However it has become customary to wear one of these garments with the strings attached for prayer as well as during the day. But if you are not wearing a four-cornered garment the law does not require that you wear the strings (like a button-down shirt or blazer don&#8217;t need the strings). So why is Rubashkin making a stink out of an issue that is not religious? Is it anti-semitic if the jail does not cooperate with this?</p>
<p>I think it is clear enough that for every &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; act against Rubashkin, there is a plausible non-anti-semitic explanation as well. Let&#8217;s just stop with the anti-semitism cries.</p>
<p>As for #3, I dare you to look a Holocaust survivor in the eye and call this anti-semitism. Try telling it to a Jew who was thrown out of Spain and Portugal for not bowing to the Cross. Or how about Jews who were slaughtered during pogroms? Being prosecuted for actual crimes is not anti-semitism. Anti-semitism is hatred and cruelty to Jews for no reason other than the fact that they are Jewish. That is not the case here.</p>
<p>I have more to say about anti-semitism in general. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>

<p>Nothing like a Supreme Court of the United States nomination to get me to blog again.</p>
<p>Elena Kagan has been nominated for the SCOTUS. I have no opinion about her. I do have an opinion about some of the people opposing her&#8230;</p>
<p>I have been planning a brief series on anti-semitism. This post will be the first of a few that deal with various specifics and nuances of anti-semitism in my opinion.</p>
<p>Have you seen the <a href="http://innate-differences.blogspot.com/2010/05/one-picture-worth-1000-kikes.html" target="_blank">cries of anti-semitism</a> connected with Kagan? They come from Orthodox Jews who have trouble dealing with their own insecurities. Why?<span id="more-2452"></span></p>
<p>Most RW Jews are very conservative politically. Kagan is not. Her existence and certainly her appointment the SCOTUS is not viewed favorably in their eyes. Subconsciously, they need a way to protest her appointment and the first thing that pops into their minds is the old &#8220;anti-semitism card&#8221;.</p>
<p>People point to the caricature of her as anti-semitic. People think that it is reminiscent of Nazi propaganda.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Nazi propaganda was general. It showed Jews as having certain features and overemphasized those features in order to make a separate point. &#8220;Jews steal&#8221;, &#8220;Jews are like vermin&#8221;, &#8220;Jews run the world&#8221;, etc. The caricature was to paint a villain with gross features and then label the villain with gross acts. It works better than painting the villain with gross acts with a face like Clooney or Pitt&#8230;</p>
<p>The cartoon of Kagan is just a cartoon. It exaggerates her features because those are HER features. It&#8217;s the same way a Leno cartoon has a huge chin and Bush cartoon has a squat head and long ears. It pokes fun at their appearance but is in no way anti-long chin or anti-squat head with long ears. Accentuating Kagan&#8217;s features in a cartoon can&#8217;t be off limits because she happens to be Jewish.</p>
<p>A second thing about all this anti-semitism talk is very ironic. I have not seen any reports from mainstream media that even mentions that Kagan is Jewish. It is not an issue for most people. Why do we think that it is an issue? It&#8217;s like we invent an issue to get upset about. Kagan was chosen because of her credentials and the diversity she brings to the court. Doesn&#8217;t that champion minorities like Jews? How is that anti-semitic!?</p>
<p>The last thing I want to address is the complaint lodged by a commenter on DovBear&#8217;s post. Mamzer Talmid Chacham said &#8220;I&#8217;d still like it better if he nominated someone who was actually a judge&#8221;. It so happens that one of the greatest SCOTUS justices of all time, Justice Warren, was not a judge. One large criticism of the SCOTUS is the seemingly similar paths all the justices took to get to the court. Choosing Kagan adds another element of much needed diversity to the court.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1618" title="Obama Basketball" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Pres.Obama_basketball_w_WH-225x300.jpg" alt="Obama Basketball" width="180" height="240" />Has the White House traveled back in time and space to the Mad Men era? To a place in time where women are 2nd class citizens and were refused equal opportunities?</p>
<p>Most people would say, &#8220;of course not&#8221;. But there are those who disagree.</p>
<p>Just ask Terry O&#8217;Neill the president for the National Organizatin of Women (NOW) about it. <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/10/now-president-on-president-obamas-allmale-athletic-outings-its-troubling.html" target="_blank">O&#8217;Neill says that this is a real issue</a>.</p>
<p>The brouhaha started with the President&#8217;s pickup basketball games. Apparently, only men have been invited to play so far. According to O&#8217;Neill, this is an affront to women everywhere.</p>
<p>Yes, she is serious.<span id="more-1617"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to believe, as the Obama Administration has been the portrayed as the most inclusive and minority friendly administration to inhabit the White House.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ridiculous because women don&#8217;t play NBA basketball. It is not because they are discriminated against, but just because they are not as good as the men. Women don&#8217;t have the same physical bodies that men have.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Neill takes this to mean that women are 2nd class. That is her problem. She can take it how she wants, but it would be prudent to be rational about it , as opposed to politically charged and driven. Here is her take:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;we need to see the White House leading the way for desegregating the work places all around the country and it is troubling.&#8221; (Hat tip <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/10/now-president-on-president-obamas-allmale-athletic-outings-its-troubling.html" target="_blank">ABC News Blog</a>)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/us/politics/25vibe.html" target="_blank">NY Times is reporting </a>that the Obama Administration does not think there is a problem here. But the NY Times digs deeper and sees that there is a sense of of &#8220;manliness&#8221; in the White House. And somehow that is a big problem as well.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Still, some high-profile sectors of the White House â economics and national security, for instance â are filled with men and exude an unmistakable male vibe.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>So apparantly, not only are women offended by not being invited to play basketball, but women are offended by &#8220;manly&#8221; men in the White House? Is it a crime for a man to be masculine. That sounds to me like discrimination against men!</p>
<p>Women are not expected to be men and men should not be expected to be like women!</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t we all just be what we are and get along?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve come a long way from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Men" target="_blank">Mad Men</a> era, I think this could be the start of the Mad Women era.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t worry too much. This just in! <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/a-first-for-president-obama-female-aide-joins-round-of-golf/?scp=1&amp;sq=women%20obama%20basketball&amp;st=Search" target="_blank">Obama has invited a female aide to play golf with him.</a> This is a first and not a moment too soon. Who thinks O&#8217;Neill will be happy with this?</p>
<p>(Not me)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1373" title="Nobel-Peace-Prize-medal" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Nobel-Peace-Prize-medal-002-300x180.jpg" alt="Nobel-Peace-Prize-medal" width="216" height="130" />Wow, two semi-political posts in a row. For a non-partisan blog that is a lot.</p>
<p>But once again, it would be impossible to ignore this elephant in the room.</p>
<p>Optimistic at best presumptuous at worse, President Obama&#8217;s recent Nobel Peace Prize award really pushes the envelope of credibilty.<span id="more-1372"></span></p>
<p>I am pretty much in 100% agreement with two of my favorite bloggers on this one so I will link to their posts.</p>
<p>DovBear nails it (as nearly always) and is most worried that <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/10/barrys-prize.html" target="_blank">the Nobel Peace Prize has been transformed into a political stunt</a>.</p>
<p>Conversations in Klal writes about the real (wrong) lesson here, that <a href="http://conversationsinklal.blogspot.com/2009/10/hell-of-carrot.html" target="_blank">we can be rewarded for promises with no results</a>.</p>
<p>My thoughts are along the same lines as both.</p>
<p>First, is this prize even worth anything anymore?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t a mandatory annual award cheapened by the fact that it must be awarded yearly with no regard for it being deserved? Doesn&#8217;t sound very meaningful to me.</p>
<p>My proposal is that when someone earns the award, give it to them. But don&#8217;t force-feed the public a manufactered awardee purely for the sake of awarding the prize. If no-one wins, no-one gets the prize.</p>
<p>Second, I am really concerned with the lesson being taught. Prizes must be earned. I wrote about this a while back when I wrote about a <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/15/winners-and-losers-a-new-yorker-cartoon-and-i-get-it-and-it-is-funny/" target="_blank">great cartoon in the New Yorker</a>. It is symptomatic of our generation that we reward prematurely and place people on pedestals before they have climbed atop the pedestal on their own.</p>
<p>We should allow things to progress organically and give projects time to breath and develop.</p>
<p>Patience is a virtue. It is time to put patience back in our society.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/36108/2009/08/03/queens-ny-last-of-gedolei-hador-rav-zelik-epstein-ztl-passes-away/" target="_blank">the Jewish world lost a spiritual giant</a> (good article worth reading). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelik_Epstein" target="_blank">Rabbi Zelik Epstein</a>, Rosh Yeshiva of Shaar Hatorah in Queens passed away. He was 97.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Zelik was a relic of the past. He studied Torah in Europe with some the greatest Torah scholars of recent American Jewry, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein" target="_blank">Rabbi Moshe </a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein" target="_blank">Feinstein</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Kamenetsky" target="_blank">Rabbi Yaakov Kamanetsky</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more significantly, he was above the fray. He did not get involved in politics and instead, studied, taught and advised and preached Torah and its values.</p>
<p><span id="more-923"></span>Today the Jewish community mourns a man of integrity, scholarship and clarity.</p>
<p>Today, I mourn a man who taught my grandfather, Sidney Greenwald, over 50 years ago in the fledgling Beis Medrash Elyon. My grandfather was very proud to have learned from R&#8217; Zelik.</p>
<p>Today, students of his across the world, in every imaginable profession and walk of life, mourn the loss of their teacher and spiritual guide.</p>
<p>Case in point: Native New Yorkers who listen to Sports Radio are all familiar with &#8220;The Fan&#8221; <a href="http://www.wfan.com/" target="_blank">660 WFAN</a>. Anyone who has listened during the daytime has become familiar with &#8220;Davening Dov Kramer&#8221;, an orthodox Jew. Davening Dov has worked at WFAN for as long as I can remember. He has been a Kiddush Hashem showing the world a wonderful example of an Observant Jew.</p>
<p>Last night Dov <a href="http://twitter.com/RabbiDMK/status/3115957704" target="_blank">sent me a Tweet</a>, to check out a note he wrote on Facebook. Dov wrote a note on his <a href="http://facebook.com/RabbiDMK" target="_blank">Facebook Profile</a> mourning the loss of his Rebbe. I highly recommend reading it in its entirety Facebook account required (if you don&#8217;t have one, send me an email and I will email the note to you directly). I would like to quote one small section that I found most powerful.</p>
<blockquote><p>I had gotten into radio to be able to reach people through the medium I always loved, and had wanted to learn the business from the &#8220;pros&#8221; before going into &#8220;Jewish&#8221; radio. &#8230; I didn&#8217;t think leaving radio (at least temporarily) would hinder my original goal of positively influencing people via the radio, so wanted to quit my job, move back to Israel (again, I was single and in my late 20s) to learn full-time. I figured I could get free room and board if I did something like being a dorm counselor at a yeshiva for Americans, so would still have no expenses and be able to focus on my learning. Before doing what I thought was clearly the &#8220;frum&#8221; thing to do (stop working to learn full-time), I went to speak to Rav Zelik.</p>
<p>I told him my plan, but he said it wasn&#8217;t a good idea. He was afraid that making such a radical change was unhealthy, and there was a danger that after a while I would regret having done it. Instead, he told me that I should keep working at WFAN &#8230; and learn for semicha at night. I had been doing some volunteer work for a kiruv organization (JEP-LI), and they offered me a job that would allow me to work half a day and learn half a day. I asked Rav Zelig if that was an option worth considering, and he told me that if I thought I could get &#8220;sipuk hanefesh,&#8221; that I would be satisfied doing kiruv professionally, that I could do it, but otherwise, the less of a change in my life I make while studying for semicha, the better.</p>

Instead, he told me that I should keep working at WFAN (I was working Sundays thru Thursdays from 11am-7pm, with &#8220;Mike and the Mad Dog&#8221; Mon-Thurs, but because of Shabbos worked Sundays instead of Fridays) and learn for semicha at night. I had been doing some volunteer work for a kiruv organization (JEP-LI), and they offered me a job that would allow me to work half a day and learn half a day. I asked Rav Zelig if that was an option worth considering, and he told me that if I thought I could get &#8220;sipuk hanefesh,&#8221; that I would be satisfied doing kiruv professionally, that I could do it, but otherwise, the less of a change in my life I make while studying for semicha, the better.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a glimpse into the insight of a great man. Many people would have just assumed that more studying was an automatically better option. R&#8217; Zelik knew his student and knew what was truly best for his situation.</p>
<p>This kind of indiviualized, custom tailored Judaism is something a bit lacking in our &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; society. We need more Rabbis who can lead like R&#8217; Zelik did.</p>
<p>It is in this light that we all mourn the loss of a true individual, a true Gadol, R&#8217; Zelik Epstein.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a Law Student, there are things I find interesting that may not interest &#8220;clients&#8221; (non-Lawyers, hehe). The following article interests me and will probably interest any lawyer or law student, anyone Jewish, or anyone that has been following the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073003563.html" target="_blank">Gates Saga</a>.</p>
<p>I invite you to contribute your opinion in the comments.</p>
<p>The article originally appeared in this week&#8217;sÂ <a href="http://jewishpress.com" target="_blank">Jewish Press</a> as an OP-ED. The writer is Nathan Lewin (<a href="http://www.lewinlewin.com/nathan.html" target="_blank">read more about him here</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span id="more-922"></span><a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/40250" target="_blank">WHAT IF GATES WERE AN UNRENOWNED JEWISH BLACK WOMAN?</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nathan Lewin</strong></p>
<p>Posted Jul 29 2009</p>
<p><strong> </strong>Soon after Cambridge police arrested and handcuffed Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. on a disorderly conduct charge, they realized the black man they wanted to prosecute was a renowned academic. As a result, he was released and the charges against him were dropped.</p>
<p>The ensuing public debate &#8211; in which Cambridge authorities now try to justify arresting a man because he refused to comply in his own home with police directions and deny that race had any influence on how the police reacted &#8211; suggests that if an ordinary black homeowner, rather than a Harvard professor, had been arrested under these circumstances, the criminal charges would not have been dropped so readily.</p>
<p>Consider the pending case of Rivka &#8211; a black, very dark-skinned, extremely devout Orthodox Jewish woman. Rivka is employed in New York, spends <em>Shabbat </em>in Washington, and her work frequently takes her on extended trips overseas. Being single and in her mid-fifties, she rented a 3-bedroom apartment on the West Side of Manhattan, and advertised on Craigslist for female roommates willing to accept short subleases. All applicants were informed by Rivka that the apartment was strictly kosher. A special page prescribing the <em>kashrut </em>rules was added to the lease that each roommate signed.</p>
<p>The rules were followed by a series of women Rivka accepted as roommates. In July 2007, a white blond-haired girl named Brooke answered Rivka&#8217;s ad and signed a five-month lease with the <em>kashrut </em>provisions. Brooke promptly violated the <em>kashrut</em> rules and admitted, in sworn testimony, that she brought nonkosher food into the apartment in knowing violation of her signed agreement. Rivka told Brooke she would have to leave.</p>
<p>Having e-mailed Brooke that she had arranged, at her &#8211; Rivka&#8217;s &#8211; expense, for a hotel room where Brooke could stay while she was looking for other accommodations, and believing that Brooke had agreed to have her belongings transported to the other location, Rivka began moving Brooke&#8217;s clothing to the hotel. Brooke arrived at the apartment unexpectedly and called the local precinct, reporting, &#8220;My roommate is currently stealing stuff out of my room.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Rivka returned after depositing Brooke&#8217;s belongings in the reserved hotel room, she found two policemen at the apartment with Brooke. The senior police officer (who is white), testified that Rivka showed them the lease and the e-mail she had sent to Brooke, and explained that she had moved Brooke&#8217;s belongings to the nearby hotel because she had an agreement with Brooke to do so. Rivka insisted to the officers that she wanted Brooke out of the apartment. The officers testified that Rivka interrupted her conversation with them to spend ten minutes in prayer.</p>
<p>Rivka then left the officers and retreated to her bedroom and locked her door. The officers demanded that she come out. On her cell phone, Rivka called a friend from the Georgetown Synagogue in Washington who had a law degree but was not in private practice. He told her to ask the officers for a warrant and for their precincts and badge numbers. The white policeman said in his testimony that he &#8220;did not recall&#8221; whether he gave his precinct and badge number.</p>
<p>When Rivka did not emerge voluntarily from her bedroom, the sergeant called the Emergency Services Unit &#8211; the police department&#8217;s riot squad. They came in full force, with more than one dozen policemen. They broke down the door to Rivka&#8217;s bedroom, dragged her into the hall and up against the wall at gunpoint, handcuffed her, and then took her downstairs to a waiting ambulance.</p>
<p>The ambulance drove to a nearby hospital. One of the officers tried to have her committed to the psychiatric unit. After an examination, the hospital said there was no basis to admit her. The police then took Rivka to the police precinct, where she was permitted one phone call. She called a person she had befriended while regularly attending <em>Shabbat</em> services at the Georgetown Synagogue, but the arresting police officer hung up the telephone in the middle of Rivka&#8217;s call.</p>
<p>Rivka was then taken to another hospital, where she was handcuffed to a bed. Next morning, she was returned to the precinct. The rabbi at the New York synagogue she attends on weekdays heard of her plight and brought a kosher meal to the precinct &#8211; the first meal Rivka had since her arrest the day before.</p>
<p>Rivka was charged with &#8220;Obstruction of Governmental Administration in the Second Degree&#8221; and with &#8220;Unlawful Eviction.&#8221; The New York D.A.&#8217;s office refused to dismiss the charges even after all the facts were presented. The young prosecutor first demanded that Rivka plead guilty and perform community service and ultimately was willing to accept an unconditional &#8220;Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal.&#8221; Rivka refused to accept any terms other than outright dismissal because she insisted she had done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>The case went to a nonjury trial before a (white) judge who was a former prosecutor. He excluded much defense testimony as irrelevant and hearsay and rejected out of hand Rivka&#8217;s right to remain in her own bedroom after her discussion with the police. At the end of the trial, he found Rivka guilty on both counts and fined her $500. Rivka is appealing.</p>
<p>Would the police have broken the bedroom door of a white gentile and charged her with crimes after being called to a dispute between her and a roommate? Is this another instance &#8211; as the Gates arrest is said to be &#8211; of injustice against blacks, aggravated by Rivka&#8217;s Jewish identity?</p>
<p>Rivka is suing New York City, the policemen, and Brooke in federal court. The docket number of her case is 08 Civ. 10065. I am her lawyer.</p>
<p><em>Nathan Lewin is a Washington attorney who has represented Jewish communities in litigation in federal courts.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/more-on-mid-east-jews.html" target="_blank">This post has been cross posted to DovBear</a> &#8211; great discussion there.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">Do Anglo/American Jews care enough about our middle-eastern Jewish brothers and sisters?</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/criticism-of-obamas-speech-db-two.html" target="_blank">DovBear posted</a> a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/opinion/09aciman.html?_r=1" target="_blank">really great Op-Ed piece from the NY Times</a>.</p>
<p>In fact. before checking his blog I even emailed the article to him as I assumed he would find it interesting.</p>
<p>Of course, I was too late as it had already been posted!</p>
<p>What occurred subsequent to his posting of the article was even more interesting.<span id="more-761"></span></p>
<p>But first let&#8217;s go to the NY Times column. An exiled Egyptian Jew recounts the persecution his family experienced in Egypt. His issue is that President Obama took the time to mention the suffering of Palestinians and ignored the suffering of middle-eastern Jews outside of Israel. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/opinion/09aciman.html?_r=1" target="_blank">A worthwhile read</a>.</p>
<p>DovBear posted the article and it got very little attention from the commenters. As opposed to a three day running argument about Mesorah (<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/why-accepting-late-date-for-proverbs-is.html">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/more-on-mishlei-mesorah.html" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/were-amoraim-orthodox.html" target="_blank">Part 3</a>) that got hundreds and hundreds of comments.</p>
<p>On Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/DovBear/statuses/2091037902" target="_blank">DovBear posted this observation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Egyptian Jew criticizes Obama in Times oped. TBF [to be fair],Â when was theÂ last time any Ashkenazi Jew shed a tear for what happened to MidEastJews?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink/statuses/2091133403" target="_blank">responded with my experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>R&#8217; Herman Neuberger dedicated YEARS of his life to save Iranian Jews. TBF &#8211; he not only shed tears, but years and saved thousands.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Which DovBear <a href="http://twitter.com/DovBear/statuses/2091226165" target="_blank">countered with a hilarious (and sad) take</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>kol hakovod [kudos] for your yachid [individual]. Average cholent fresser [eater] from flatbush doesn&#8217;t know and doesnt care.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that DovBear is right. Where is the outrage from Ashkenazic Jews? Why does it seem like we don&#8217;t care?</p>
<p>The rest of this post is dedicated to bringing awareness to the plight of middle-eastern Jewry and an invitation for those of you may have first hand information regarding living as a Jew in Iran, Iraq, Egypt or any other middle-eastern country to contribute.</p>
<p>My first step was to contact a grandson of the aforementioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_N._Neuberger" target="_blank">Rabbi Herman Neuberger</a>.</p>
<p>Eli Neuberger relayed the following history of Iranian Jewry that is related to his grandfather&#8217;s involvement. (I have edited his comments for brevity, grammar and overall fluidity.)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The traditional Iranian Jewish schools were run by an umbrella organization called Otzar HaTorah.In the mid 70&#8242;s the Shah and his government decided to nationalise all religious schools, Jewish and Islam alike in order to curb the radical influence that was gaining traction amongst the Muslims. My Grandfather was approached by a Mr. Sasson from London, to travel to Iran to negotiate with the Government in order to minimize secular influence on religious studies.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>While in Iran, my Grandfather visited the community in Shiraz. He thought that if a group of promising Iranians would come to learn at the </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivas_Ner_Yisroel" target="_blank"><em>Ner Israel Rabbinical College</em></a><em> (NIRC), where he was the Dean. Then they could return to Iran and become the Klei Kodesh (spiritual leaders) that could lead the community.The first group arrived in 1977.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>Meanwhile in 1979 the Shah was overthrown by radical Islamists.The students in NIRC could not expect to return home. At the time, many Iranian Jews were able to leave Iran and when they arrived in Austria, Italy etc. they were granted refugee status and were able to continue on to the US.</em></p>
<p><em>The situation became far more dire in 1980 when the Iran-Iraq war started.Boys as young as 12-13 were sent to the front lines to be used as mine sweepers. Many Jews were smuggled to Turkey or Pakistan. These trips were fraught with danger, even after they were able to leave Iran. My grandfather was instrumental in assuring good treatment in Turkey and safe passage to Europe. He made many trips to the corridors of power in DC to speak to Congressman,Senators and Diplomats to be able to insure this continuing clandestine exodus.</em></p>
<p><em>Many of the boys that made the harrowing trip came to study Torah in NIRC.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>All this good work was done behind the scenes and with very little fanfare.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>According to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">n</span>ever accurate Wikipedia, Rabbi Neuberger was instrumental in saving 60,000 Iranian Jews.</p>
<p>I contacted another friend of mine, Natan Davoodi. His family is Iranian (in LA they are called Persian).</p>
<p>He told me that as far as he knows the non-Jews only tolerate the Jews of they can exploited for the benefit of the non-Jew. That doesn&#8217;t sound very good.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I did not mention Roger Cohen. A NY Times columnist, Cohen has a thing for the Iranians. He thinks all is honky-dory in Iran. He writes about it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/opinion/23cohen.html?scp=7&amp;sq=roger%20cohen&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/opinion/02cohen.html?scp=10&amp;sq=roger%20cohen&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">here</a>. Absolute disgrace.</p>
<p>I would like to hear from you if you know of any injsutice to Jewish people in middle-eastern countries (outside of Israel). Just telling those stories will get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>We are all brothers and sisters and there is no excuse for ignoring their plight.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2008/12/17/malcolm-gladwell-and-perfection/" target="_blank">have had</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/01/genius-the-modern-view-and-the-torah-view/" target="_blank">my critiques</a> of David Brooks from the NY Times.</p>
<p><a href="http://theconversation.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/guns-gays-and-abortion/" target="_blank">But today,Â  I think he got it right</a>. Really right. Like, 100% right.</p>
<p>He was asked about the &#8220;Big Three&#8221;. No, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_automobile_manufacturers" target="_blank">GM, Ford, Chrysler</a>. No, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_%28universities%29" target="_blank">Harvard, Yale, Princeton</a>. Not, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_leaders_of_World_War_I" target="_blank">Clemenceau, Wilson, George </a>either.</p>
<p>The new Big Three is Guns, Gays and Abortion.<span id="more-738"></span></p>
<p>Brooks was asked his opinion of why the trend in the country is towards Gay rights, the trend is to ignore Gun rights and the trend is against Abortion after the first trimester. In the &#8220;asker&#8217;s&#8221; opinion, there seems to be tension pulling these issues from opposite sides. One is trending &#8220;left&#8221;, one is trending &#8220;right&#8221;, and one is not trending at all.</p>
<p>What she really wants to know is why isn&#8217;t the left or right winning on all these issues? How come they are trending in three different directions.</p>
<p>Brooks answers very profoundly and eloquently. His basic premise is that Americans seek to <em>maintain the social fabric of their existence</em>.</p>
<p>Most Americans have gay friends, co-workers, relatives, neighbors etc. and therefore it preserves the social fabric of the American&#8217;s existence to provide rights for their gay acquaintances.</p>
<p>Guns is a rural vs. urban issue so it depends on where you live that you seek to preserve your social environment. Thus, there is little movement on this issue.</p>
<p>Finally, on abortion, he proclaims most Americans are torn by the issue. We are uncomfortable imposing any opinion on our fellow Americans because it is such a sensitive issue. Thus, most people fall in the middle and trend slightly to the left or the right but are not vocal about it. Therefore, change is not likely on the abortion issue.</p>
<p>Wow. Brooks really did a great job explaining how our country works. Really, he has explained how humans work. How our world works. We care about our social environments and we try to preserve them.</p>
<p>Truthfully, humans are social beings. This is what really separates man from beast. We interact in a more complex way than any other being in our world.</p>
<p>We consider any hominid existence prior to the establishment of a social environment such as cities as prehistoric. History begins when we begin to socialize our existence.</p>
<p>We continue socializing in our lives to this very day.</p>
<p>When we meet new people we are socializing.</p>
<p>When we have guests join us for a meal we are socializing.</p>
<p>When we useÂ social networking toolsÂ like <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/eliyahufink" target="_blank">Facebook </a>and <a href="http://rabbifink.wordpress.com" target="_blank">blogs</a> we are socializing.</p>
<p>I believe that the synagogue is a social place. Certainly, our <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Shul on the Beach</a> is a social place. Yes, we worship in shul, but that could technically be done solo.</p>
<p>We are mandated by Halacha to create and foster houses of worship and to attend them as a group to appeal to the social needs of man.</p>
<p>So come join us!</p>

<p><a href="finkorswim.com/2009/04/22/earth-day/" target="_blank">Previously</a>, I talked about the Torah approach to Earth Day. Today, I am going to take a brief dip into Green Politics. Normally, I steer clear of politics. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/11/political-discrimination/" target="_blank">One exception </a>was when I wrote about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/11/political-discrimination/" target="_blank">Political Discrimination</a>. Now that technology gives us the ability to figure out who believes in what politics, it is possible to discriminate against people whom you never knew, because of their politics.</p>
<p>My general opinion in politics is <span id="more-565"></span>that red / blue, left / right, new / old, liberal / conservative are terms too broad for today&#8217;s sophisticated world. I can agree and disagree with policies based on my understanding, not based on party. I really have no political agenda, I don&#8217;t care which &#8220;party&#8221; is in control. I care about issues.</p>
<p>Parties were needed when the public wasn&#8217;t educated on the issues. But now with 24/7 news cycles, <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Eliyahu-Fink/3417514" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, blogs and more information produced than ever before, folks are capable of thinking on their own.</p>
<p>After seeing <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/05/my-new-torture-trump-card.html" target="_blank">this post</a> on <a href="http://DovBear.Blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear.Blogspot.com</a> a thought occured to me. A bit of a disturbing trend has evolved. When idiots on the right say dumb things or make bad decisions, the other side attacks them. However, the attacks are getting less and less sophisticated and more and more ridiculous.</p>
<p>John Stewart is never going to be taken really seriously because he is seen on Comedy Central. However, another, more disturbing attack is more serious.</p>
<p>A video called &#8220;The Story of Stuff&#8221; has been circulated the web and been introduced into the middle school classrooms of many schools. The broader message of the video is great. We need to be careful about our consumption and waste is bad.</p>
<p>Even better is the criticism of our need for replacing what we have and our disposable culture. The video critiques our values as we place spending above all else. These are great lessons. So what is wrong with the video?</p>
<p>Watch the video (or at least watch the intro).</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9GorqroigqM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9GorqroigqM&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Did you notice anythingÂ  strange?</p>
<p>Portraying our government as an army tank?</p>
<p>Corporations as big, ballooning, fat, men?</p>
<p>Calling our products &#8220;toxic and contaminated&#8221;?</p>
<p>The point is that the message could be delivered without all the harsh, hyperbolic name-calling. The way of conservation and care for our planet and its resources is such simple and beautiful concept. Why are they fouling it up with strong symbolism and propaganda?</p>
<p>The answer is because of the political parties in our country. One can&#8217;t agree with an issue, one needs to choose a side. And when you are choosing sides it is war. And in war we pull our all the stops.</p>
<p>This is not good for America, nor is it good for the good causes on each side of the political spectrum. For all the talk of &#8220;Bipartisan-ism&#8221; have we seen any results other than <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/04/28/DI2009042801805.html" target="_blank">one senator turning on his constituents to switch parties</a>. Which is the opposite of Bipartisan-ism!</p>
<p>To paraphrase Rodney King, &#8220;can we all get along?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, I know this is never gonna happen, but we can dream right? (and point out the flaws in the terrible system we have now).</p>
<p>Please, regardless of your politics, conserve, don&#8217;t use plastics unnecessarily, don&#8217;t waste what you have, use what have, appreciate what you have, help our society escape its never ending cycle of consumption and make sure the world is as beautiful when we leave as it was when we got here.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a hotel room, no-one is coming to clean up our mess after we check out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I wrote about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/10/jew-kipedia-and-tolerance/" target="_blank">tolerance</a>. Democracy is built on tolerance. We are each entitled to our opinions and are not subject to discrimination based on our political beliefs.</p>
<p>We all love <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy" target="_blank">democracy</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy" target="_blank">It</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy" target="_blank">sure</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe" target="_blank">beats</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship" target="_blank">alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>One major benefit to democracy is the right to voice your opinion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_ballot" target="_blank">anonymously in a vote</a>. That is how we choose our law and policy makers in the USA. This is great because one cannot be persecuted or discriminated against based upon your political choices if you choose to keep your choices a secret.</p>
<p>Right now that is being put to the test. More and more people are being discriminated against for their political views.</p>
<p><span id="more-329"></span> It seems that we have a new problem in our Democratic country. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/business/08stream.html?ref=technology" target="_blank">NY Times is reporting</a> that there is a website which makes this really easy to do. I have seen this myself in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCXt_uajrZU&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">Los Angeles</a>. Protesters picketed a very popular local restaurant. There was even a little bit of violence! Using a <a href="http://www.eightmaps.com/" target="_blank">website </a>it is possible to see who donated to Prop 8 and correspondingly figure out who doesn&#8217;t support Gay marriage. It&#8217;s really irrelevant what you believe, what is relevant is the secret ballot is the worst kept secret ever. Technology is great but sometimes progress leads to a regress. This type of website is a regression.</p>
<p>Now anyone who wants to discriminate based upon political views can do so quite easily. All political donations are public information and if someone wants to know how you feel on an issue they can find out pretty easily if you&#8217;ve ever made a political donation.</p>
<p>This has a negative effect in two ways. One, you may think twice before making that donation. That can&#8217;t be good. Two, if you&#8217;re opinion is not popular, you may be suffering the consequences quickly. That&#8217;s definitely not good.</p>
<p>Democracy is great but we need to figure out how to curb this problem before it eradicates the democratic roots of our country!</p>
