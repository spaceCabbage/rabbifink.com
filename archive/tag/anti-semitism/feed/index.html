				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The week began with a salacious NY Post cover story and headline. Almost everyone I know felt that the headline was in bad taste and unnecessarily callous to a murder victim and his victim. What has been subject to debate is whether the headline and story were anti-Semitic. Some people are convinced that the headline was hateful and racist. Others see this is as a typical NY Post headline with no malicious intent. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/01/06/a-post-on-the-new-york-post-and-the-post-stark-murder-fiasco/" target="_blank">I agree with the latter</a>.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone by the Post, the Yated Ne&#8217;eman ratcheted the hyperbole and histrionics to a whole new level. The people who think the cover story was anti-Semitic generally say that the insensitivity was indicative of a lack of respect to Jewish people. That Jewish blood is cheap. Or that it&#8217;s okay to make fun of Jews. Soft racism. But no one dared to compare the NY Post headline to the kind of real anti-Semitism of Ashkenazi history. No one actually thought that the headline was a harbinger of genocide or part of a general danger to Jewish people in America.</p>
<p>Enter the Yated.<span id="more-8025"></span></p>
<p>In this op-ed, the Post headline editor seems to be compared to Lavan, Eisov, Nevuchadnetzar, Trotsky, Lenin &#038; Stalin, Titus, Ferdinand, Isabella, Mussolini, and of course Hitler. The editorial is sure to make the distinction between America and the countries where we were slaughtered in Europe. But the relationship is noted and we are reminded that we will always be hated and we don&#8217;t really live here, we are actually like homeless people on a park bench.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/complex-ptsd.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8026" alt="complex-ptsd" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/complex-ptsd.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The reactions to this editorial have ranged from the apocalyptic to approbatory. The immediate reaction of some people was to say that this is a disgraceful piece of writing that stomps on the graves of real victims of Jew hatred. It&#8217;s an opportunistic piece that so overstates its case that one might confuse it with an article in the Onion. Others see this as validation for their feelings. Many people are certain that we are hated and the NY Post front page was evidence and this editorial confirms their beliefs.</p>
<p>More than a few people asked me what I thought about the editorial. At first, I was outraged. I tend to err on the side of not saying things are anti-Semitism. So to see the extreme opposite of my own view so starkly presented was jarring and it bothered me a lot. But after another person emailed me about how much they enjoyed the editorial, I decided to read it again.</p>
<p>The reason I think the Post headline was not anti-Semitic or malicious is because it was a quote from an investigator of the murder. Taking the words in their context, all he meant was that there are a lot of suspects. But people jumped to the erroneous conclusion that the Post was condoning murder because they couldn&#8217;t be bothered to read the actual content of the article and think about what was actually being said. I didn&#8217;t want to do the same thing to the Yated Editorial. I think some of the people who are really upset by the editorial are doing a little bit of the same here. They see some words that validate their opinion, but I think it&#8217;s broader than that.</p>
<p>To me, the editorial was not actually saying that the Post was anti-Semitic or that its editor is comparable to the aforementioned murderer&#8217;s row. Sometimes we can see something or read something and it gives us a feeling or a sense of something that was triggered by what we experienced. If a victim of abuse sees someone who looks or even smells like their attacker, it can trigger fear or pain in the victim. It does not help to say to victim &#8220;don&#8217;t get upset, it&#8217;s a different person&#8221; because it&#8217;s not that the victim actually thinks it&#8217;s the same person. Rather, the victim is feeling trauma due to the association.</p>
<p>Similarly, one can read a book or watch a film and feel things that are inspired by the media that they are consuming. One can interpret art in a way that is completely opposite from the way it was intended. That doesn&#8217;t mean that the book, film, or art actually means the things that they feel. Rather, their reaction is colored by their life experiences and when combined with the media the result is a new thing unique to them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that is what is intended by this editorial. It&#8217;s not saying that the NY Post cover story was anything like real anti-Semitism. Rather, when we see something that triggers our collective memory of anti-Semitism we feel something. It does not matter that two out of three journalists on the Stark story were Jewish or that the Post is likely the most pro-Israel secular paper in circulation. Of course it&#8217;s not anti-Semitism, but seeing those words reminds us of anti-Semitism. What we see and what we read can have an unintended affect on us.</p>
<p>The editorial says:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I see mean,<br />
Vicious,<br />
Hatred,<br />
Screaming loudly to the city and world.</p>
<p>I think back to<br />
Lavan.<br />
Eisov.<br />
Nevuchadnetzar.<br />
Trotsky, Lenin &amp; Stalin.</p>
<p>All the way back in time.<br />
Until this very day.<br />
Who hasn’t wanted to see us dead and buried?</p>
<p>Jewish blood has always been cheap,<br />
Nobody cared when they came after us.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>He&#8217;s writing about what he sees. Not what it says. He&#8217;s writing about where his thoughts take him after seeing something like this. He is remembering our bloody history. Not because this is that. It&#8217;s just because inevitably, our minds associate this kind of headline or the thinking of &#8220;who didn&#8217;t want him dead&#8221; with the most difficult of times. This is not one of those times, but to some f us it can feel like it is because we have been triggered by what was seen in the Post. He expresses skepticism at the friendship offered by our Gentile neighbors. Not because we know them to be liars, haters, or bigots. But because we&#8217;ve been traumatized before and forgive us for not forgetting the &#8220;friendships&#8221; of generations past.</p>
<p>So I can understand this kind of reaction. It&#8217;s not logical. It&#8217;s not even 100% serious. It&#8217;s just an expression of feelings that bubble to the surface whenever something can be seen as anti-Semitic enters the public eye. It&#8217;s okay to remind us that we are guests in this country. That&#8217;s the beauty of America. We are all guests here. That&#8217;s why we do so well here.</p>
<p>Still, I think it was a mistake to publish this editorial. I think more people will actually think that the Post editorial is being compared to real anti-Semitism. I think more people will attribute malicious intent to the Post. I think people will use the editorial as a confirmation that this is the beginning of the end for us in America.</p>
<p>We can do better. I think we can work on sorting through our triggers. We should try to see things for what they are and not allow our emotional associations carry the day. We should not be feeding the monster of seeing anti-Semitism in everything.</p>
<p>But this is what we get when a basic Jewish education includes elements of xenophobia and demonization of the outside. I am pretty sure that if we had less of that, we would have less Post Anti-Semitic Trauma Stress Disorder. We would do well to try to get past our PASTSD and we will be able to focus more on being good neighbors and citizens instead of dreading doomsday. A more sanguine outlook would be a breath of fresh air for our tormented people.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Check out my latest for Haaretz. The ADL says there are a lot of anti-Semites in America. I argue that most people who hate Jews are general bigots and their hatred is not specific to Jews. To me, this means that they are not really anti-Semites. It&#8217;s important to properly diagnose problems and I think the ADL is misdiagnosing here.</p>
<p>Here is the lede. I can put the rest on the blog in a couple days.<span id="more-7798"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>The Anti-Defamation League released the results of a recent poll that indicates anti-Semitic attitudes have decreased by 3 percent since 2011. That’s the good news. The bad news is that according to the ADL, too many people continue to harbor anti-Semitic views. But I am not sure we can really call those who hold these views anti-Semites.</p>
<p>Anti-Semitism used to refer to irrational hatred of Jews and violence stemming from that hatred. For most of history, people lived in communities, towns, and cities with like-minded people of similar ethnicity. Over the last 2,000 years, the “other” in many communities was the Jew. The Jew lived among the nations of the world as a second-class citizen or worse. The classically anti-Semitic cities of Eastern Europe were made up of people who shared common ancestry and lived together for generations. The Jews were the usurpers, the invaders, the minority, the people to blame for their problems. Thus, anti-Semitism.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hate-crimes-stop-hating.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7000" alt="hate-crimes-stop-hating" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hate-crimes-stop-hating.jpg?resize=300%2C225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Why do we focus so much on anti-Semitism? A recent article on Aish.com makes a decent point that the State of Israel did not solve anti-Semitism. Herzl hoped it would end Jew hatred. Clearly it did not.</p>
<p>But for some reason the writer, Rabbi Blech, emphasizes that hatred of Jews is unreasonable and defies logic. Well obviously. Hating anyone for no reason is by definition nonsensical. The odd implication seems to be that hatred of others makes sense and hatred of Jews does not.</p>
<p>I disagree. There is irrational hatred all over the world. Is it rational to hate people because of the color of skin? Is it rational to hate any of the persecuted minorities and ethnic groups? Of course not.</p>
<p>Yet around the world and over the course of history people have been persecuted and hated for being just slightly different. Whether they are different looking, different speaking, different thinking, different anything. There are plenty of excused people give to hate. None of them make a bit of sense. Hate is universal. Us Jewish people have not cornered the market on being hated.<span id="more-6999"></span></p>
<p>I think what makes anti-Semitism unique is that Jews have lived all over the world and been a minority in so many places that we have managed to have more people in more places hate us for no reason than anyone else. Other hated people are more localized. Seems to me, that is a more logical explanation than to create a qualitative distinction between hating Jews and hating everyone else.</p>
<p>Rabbi Blech says the true answer to anti-Semitism is that &#8220;we persist in fulfilling our mission to serve as the world’s conscience until all of mankind learns to acknowledge the beautiful truths of our heritage.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think this is a complete answer. Hatred of Jews defies logic. Being the world&#8217;s conscience won&#8217;t fix stupid.</p>
<p>The more complete antidote to anti-Semitism and all hate is to preach love and tolerance, to find common ground with others, to create opportunities for people to learn more about one another and realize on their own that there is nothing rational about hating people for the simple fact that they are different.</p>
<p>There is no rule that states that people must hate one another in order for the world to spin on its axis. It can end and it will end. But let&#8217;s not limit ourselves to working on Jew hatred. All hate is the same and all hate can be fixed pretty easily.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/antisemitism.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6503" title="antisemitism" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/antisemitism.jpg?resize=245%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>At times like these, when Israel engages in a military operation and the world watches, two things are guaranteed: There will be biased or unfair reporting against Israel and there will be claims of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Anti-Semitism is an interesting thing. There certainly is precedent for Jew Hating and Jew Killing. Historically, this was an ideological position that was espoused by dominant religion against Jews. Whether it was Christians or Muslims, Jew hating was part of their religious beliefs. As the Western World became less fervently religious anti-Semitism spilled over into the secular world as well.</p>
<p>Along with anti-Semitism, dominant groups have long hated the &#8220;other&#8221;. Sometimes dominant groups hated each other. There are minorities in the United States of America, Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, that suffer discrimination on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t argue whether there is something &#8220;different&#8221; about anti-Semitism or not in this post. I am not convinced that hating Jews is catergorically different than hating any other &#8220;different group&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rabbi Slifkin, who I love and with whom I have the pleasure of a personal friendship, argues in his recent post that anti-Semitism can be used as a source of inspiration to believe in God.<span id="more-6502"></span></p>
<p>Here is the punchline:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many readers are struggling with the fundamentals of faith. Is it rational to believe that there is something special about the Jews? That we are the chosen people? Aren&#8217;t we just yet another nation with delusions of grandeur?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I think that one can also draw faith, albeit in an odd way, from the blood libel, especially in its contemporary incarnation. In the entire global history of armed conflict, no nation has done remotely as much as Israel to minimize civilian (and even military) casualties amongst its enemies. Yet simultaneously, no nation receives remotely as much condemnation for killing civilians!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Is this normal?! Does this reflect a world in which there is nothing other than the order of nature?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Like I said, it&#8217;s somewhat odd to draw faith from something negative. But I find it to be an enormously powerful example of how there is something unique about the Jewish People. Overwhelming, bizarrely irrational global hatred; and yet we have survived, and returned to our homeland. Am Yisrael Chai!</em></p>
<p>I agree with Rabbi Slifkin that we should definitely try to draw faith from wherever we can draw it. I&#8217;ve written the same thing in a different context.</p>
<p>However, I was curious if Rabbi Slifkin actually meant that anti-Semitism is due to some supernatural cause or if it was simply irrational for people to hate Jews. His answer? The former. In other words, according to Rabbi Slifkin, the world&#8217;s irrational hatred for us is Divinely ordained. (I think that is what he was saying. I am not trying to put words in his mouth.)</p>
<p>While I said above that I won&#8217;t argue whether the phenomena of anti-Semitism is unique, I also will not argue that it is not irrational. But I will argue that just because it might be unique and irrational it does not imply that God is causing anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>The view of Maimonides (and some would argue Nachmanides) regarding God&#8217;s interaction with the world is that it is limited. It mostly manifests itself through Nature, as created by God. Miracles occur from time to time and bend or break the rules of nature. Not everyone agrees with this view of God&#8217;s interaction with the world. Certainly there are much more expansive views and in fact those views have taken hold in orthodox Judaism as mainstream opinions.</p>
<p>Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s website is called Rationalist Judaism. While there is no such thing as pure Rationalism when it comes to Judaism, there are some basic principles to Rationalist Judaism. One of those principles, I believe, is &#8220;minimalism&#8221;. That is, when there is no need to rely on a supernatural phenomena or a fantastical interpretation, Rationalist Judaism does not do so. If we say that anti-Semitism is supernatural, I think we are saying that God interferes with nature and puts the anti-Semitism into the world. I think that is what it means when we say that anti-Semitism is Divine.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument let us presume that anti-Semitism is unique and irrational. I don&#8217;t believe that it implies Divinity. Hatred of other groups is also unique (maybe) and definitely irrational. Would we make the same claim and say that those minorities are persecuted by some Divine measure? I don&#8217;t think Rationalist Judaism would. Which leaves me to wonder, why would we do so when it comes to hatred or dehumanization of us Jews?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we are forced to say that anti-Semitism implies a supernatural cause. Unless one already believes <em>everything</em> is caused supernaturally (a fine, traditional position) I don&#8217;t see why anti-Semitism should be different.</p>
<p><em>Lest you invoke &#8220;Halacha Yadua Eisav Soneh l&#8217;Yaakov&#8221; see this excellent article by Rabbi Adlerstein: <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2006/09/05/is-antisemitism-universal/" target="_blank">Is Anti-Semitism Universal?</a></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/shangri_la.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6083" title="shangri la santa monica" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/shangri_la.jpg?resize=300%2C226" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Jewish Press is reporting that a very fancy Santa Monica hotel, the Shangri-La is being sued by a Jewish man. <a href="pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Our shul</a> is just a couple miles south of the Shangri-La. The suit alleges that two years ago a group of young Jewish professionals were hosting an event at the hotel on behalf of Friends of the IDF. They claim that they had made all the proper arrangements with the hotel in advance and the hotel cooperated with them when they arrived. The hotel had a security and logistics meeting about the event.</p>
<p>Not too long after the group checked-in, the owner of the hotel, the daughter of a Pakistani Muslim real estate mogul, told the staff to remove the Jewish guests. They were easy to identify by their blue wristbands they were wearing in support of the IDF.</p>
<p><span id="more-6082"></span></p>
<p>The hotel claims that the group did not make the necessary arrangements with the hotel in advance and thus were trespassing on hotel property when they were ousted. However, the attorney for the plaintiffs told the Jewish Press that the defendants were unable to provide any evidence to support their allegation that the group was trespassing. Further, the hotel owner was overheard telling hotel staff that her father would disown her if she did not have the Jews removed from the hotel.</p>
<p>While removing the Jews from the premises, the hotel staff were looking for Jewish guests and identifying them by their blue wristbands. The Jewish Press says this evokes the use of yellow stars to identify Jews during the Holocaust. An apt comparison, if a bit dramatic.</p>
<p>It is surprising that this case is proceeding to trial. I would have expected a quiet settlement. A trial will likely make this case a bit of a spectacle and that is unfortunate for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Are there Americans who bear hatred for Jews? Absolutely. Do I think that this situation is motivated by hatred for Jews? As the facts present themselves at this point, I do. It pains me terribly that bigots still exist.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t expect everyone to be accommodating and tolerant. I hope they can be and will be accommodating and tolerant, but hatred runs deep and it is very difficult to deprogram people, especially if they are not willing to be reprogramed. Many people are small-minded and tribal. But it can be overcome.</p>
<p>I also think that this fellow is making the proper response. The courts are equipped to handle this kind of behavior and it is far better than vigilantism that I have seen some other people promoting. I also strongly suggest that Jews not use this hotel in the future and urge all tolerant and loving non-Jewish people to avoid the Shangri-La in Santa Monica. A place that acts in this manner does not deserve the support or respect of the broader community.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the matter will be resolved fairly and the owners of the Shangri-La will learn an important lesson. Bigotry and hate are not tolerated in America. When you come here, you need to leave your prejudice and racism behind.</p>
<p>Most of all, I hope that the Jewish people can be a model of respect, tolerance, and love for all. We have been through the wringer over the last 2000 years. We have never been guests in a place as tolerant and multi-cultural as the United States of America. We, of all people, can appreciate the gift of American freedom and we should be ambassadors for that freedom. We should strive to teach tolerance and acceptance of others in our communities. It is an important value, and in our more insular communities it is in danger of being lost or forgotten without direct instruction.</p>
<p>This case is an embarrassment to Santa Monica, to Los Angeles, to California, and to the United States of America. Let us hope is it the last such case on American soil, and eventually the world.</p>

An unidentified gunman shot several people outside a Jewish school. When Jewish people are suffering anywhere in the world, Jews all over the rest of the world suffer with them. It is a great testament to our unity and sense of camaraderie that we can feel the pain of our Jewish brethren though we have never met.</p>
<p>Death, especially sudden death, inflicts a wound upon the survivors. When a fellow Jew is killed we are all survivors. For now, the pain is being channeled into grief and connection. Jews all over the world are expressing their solidarity and love for the victims, their families, and the entire French Jewish community.</p>
<p>When Jews are killed, another reasonable reaction is to immediately assume that anti-Semitism is a factor.<span id="more-5287"></span> This is turn, gets channeled into fervent Zionism, and sometimes translates into sympathy for movements like the JDL. I can understand these sentiments. With our collective history, it is absolutely a natural reaction.</p>
<p>With regard to this recent tragedy, there is no evidence of ant-Semitism. Complicating matters further is the forensic evidence that shows that other shootings in the area in the last few days were committed using the same weapon. The other shootings targeted French paratroopers of non-Jewish ethnicity. The modus operandi was also the same. A man on a motorcycle fired shots and then sped away.</p>
<p>To my untrained mind, it seems that the same man is the shooter. If that is the case, it is even harder to see anti-Semitism in today&#8217;s horrible tragedy.</p>
<p>I think it is slightly irresponsible to blame anti-Semitism when there is none. I understand that it is a natural reaction. But anti-Semitism cannot be presumed in any and every instance where Jewish people are killed. There may turn out to be anti-Semitism in this case. But at this point, I can&#8217;t see how that can be assumed.</p>
<p>Also, slightly cringeworthy is the <em>&#8220;may God avenge their blood&#8221;</em> sentiment. We can mourn and express pain without being bloodthirsty in our expressions.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let us mourn responsibly. Let us mourn these deaths as one. We are in a deep collective pain. Let us channel that pain to improving the world and increasing love and kindness in the world to properly avenge the death of our brothers and sister in France.</p>
<p><em>May their memories be for a blessing.</em></p>

For the benefit of the non-Facebookers and for the sake of having a more permanent record of my</p>
<p>When the San Francisco ban on circumcision was first proposed months ago I wrote two posts defending one&#8217;s right to circumcise their son. One was from a legal perspective: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/19/is-a-ban-on-circumcision-constitutional-probably-not/">Is a Ban on Circumcision Constitutional? Probably Not</a> and the other from a moral perspective: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/22/circumcision-follow-up-or-why-circumcision-is-not-barbaric-for-orthodox-jews/">Circumcision Follow Up (or why circumcision is not barbaric for Orthodox Jews)</a>.</p>
<p>Since that time, I have had several conversations in the comments on my blog as well as other Internet forums with the proponents of the ban. These folks call themselves Intactivists and they are a voice that needs to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>As Rabbi Adlerstein wrote in <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/06/01/banning-mila-and-the-ascendance-of-china/" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Banning-Circumcision-The-Target-Is-Religion-Not-Jews-Yitzchok-Adlerstein-06-01-2011.html" target="_blank">places</a>, the battle against circumcision is in essence a battle against religion. I don&#8217;t agree with every word of Rabbi Adlerstein&#8217;s essays but the fact remains that the reason Intactivists exist is because they believe religion is a myth. They believe that following the precepts of the Torah, New Testament, Quran or any other religious text that claims to be the word of God is backwards and ridiculous. By extension, any religious practice based on the words of these religious texts is similar to taking instruction from a fairy tale.</p>
<p>I can understand that position. I vehemently disagree. But I can understand it.<span id="more-4318"></span></p>
<p>They reason that if the Torah is a fraud then following the Torah is silly. And if the Torah says to circumcise then circumcision is silly.</p>
<p>These people have the right to believe as they do.</p>
<p>They can even try to have the practice banned. A conversation will need to take place regarding the limits of governmental interference on a widespread religious practice. Medical data will be used but in reality be useless as the medical community takes no official position on the benefits or harms of circumcision. In the end, the likely result will hopefully be a better mutual understanding of the positions in this discussion and a legal conclusion.</p>
<p>I am happy to have the discussion with Intactivists. I believe a discussion benefits everyone.</p>
<p>However, a recent comic book seems to completely change the game.</p>
<p>A comic book called Foreskin Man has been published to promote the circumcision ban. The comic book is a propaganda piece that turns doctors and mohels into villains. The content is pure appeal to emotion. There is no logic, no discussion, no argument in favor of the ban. It is a good vs. evil story with the good cast as the Intactivists and the evil cast as those who circumcise. This would bad enough as far as propaganda goes.</p>
<p>But the comic book takes it a step further. Moving the conversation away from circumcision, the comic book taps into centuries of anti-Semitic propaganda using caricatures that haven&#8217;t been used since the Holocaust. Further, the comic book portrays the &#8220;good&#8221; side as blond, Aryan-looking and white. It looks like a KKK or Aryan Brotherhood comic book. The pictures are obscene and message to me is clear.</p>
<p>This is not about circumcision. This is not even about religion. This is about anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Those who know me can attest, I am the last person to assert anti-Semitism. I am an optimist and don&#8217;t believe that the non-Jewish public hates Jews. But this comic book is anti-Semitic. <em><a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/06/01/banning-mila-and-the-ascendance-of-china/" target="_blank">Res ipsa loquitur</a></em>.</p>
<p>The best case scenario for the Intactivists would be to claim that this comic book is NOT representative of their true views. It is one unhinged madman. That may be true, but until that is asserted or shown to be true, Foreskin Man casts the entire Intactivist operation under the shadow of anti-Semitism. Unless it can show otherwise, there is no longer any room for discussion. Once you use racial bias, epithetic imagery and ugly caricatures to make your point, you&#8217;ve lost the right to be a part of the conversation.</p>
<p>To be clear, I understand the Atheist&#8217;s position on circumcision. I welcome conversation about whether a circumcision ban is legal or moral or ethical or whatever. But the conversation is over until this disgusting anti-Semitic rhetoric ends and ends for good.</p>

<p>I say unfortunately mis-titled because the book was excellent but it really was not about Jewish Pirates and certainly was not limited at all to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The book was good because it tells the story of some of the most famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converso">Converso</a> Jews following the Spanish and Porteguese Inquisition. The well footnoted text gave me a better appreciation for the 15 century Mediterranean Jews, their struggles and their success.</p>
<p>Perhaps above all, as I was reading the book I found myself with a greater appreciation for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardi_Jews">Sephardi Jews</a>.<span id="more-2598"></span></p>
<p>I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385513984?tag=eliyfink-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0385513984&amp;adid=08VJ6CN5645XHVXWS555&amp;">Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean</a> piecemeal. Every few weeks I would pick it up again and read another section. Meanwhile, in the real world, the Rubashkin saga has been dominated Jewish headlines. All the while, playing the victim card and charges of anti-Semitism in the legal system abound. The contrast of the Rubashkin campaigns and the reactions of the Conversos was striking.</p>
<p>Following decades of persecution and systematic genocide, the Jews of Spain and Portugal were forced northward. Many settled in Amsterdam. The local government tolerated the Jews but there were some blatantly anti-Jewish laws. The Jews were able to practice Judaism and in many respects they thrived there. For these refugee Jews, life was tough. It was not easy being Jewish.</p>
<p>The book follows the story of some of the Amsterdam Jews.</p>
<p>Not once, did I see a reference to &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221;. The Meditteranean Jews did not deal with their persecution by labeling it as anti-Semitism. I did not see any attempt to portray themselves as victims or the &#8220;lamb among the lions&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ashkenazic Jews were also persecuted heavily. They were ousted from many countries and killed in many genocides. To cope with the hate and bloodshed, anti-Semitism was &#8220;blamed&#8221;.</p>
<p>This got me thinking. My impression of the current Sephardic Jewry landscape is very similar. I don&#8217;t recall hearing accusations of anti-Semitism when it comes to Sephardic Jews. Just last summer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Dwek">Solomon Dwek </a> was arrested on Federal charges of bank fraud. This criminal pled guilty and awaits sentencing. I did not hear a peep about any anti-Semitism in his investigation.</p>
<p>Dwek is Sephardic.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the bank fraud that Rubashkin has been charged with. I have spoke to otherwise reasonable people who are convinced the whole thing is a plot by the anti-Semitic government. They say things like &#8220;this is how it was in Germany 1935&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rubashkin is not Sephardic.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that they heritage play a role in our collective reactions.</p>
<p>On one level, it seems that Sephardic Jewry never had a culture of blaming anti-Semitism while Ashkenazik Jewry has been crying about anti-Semitism for six centuries and using the term for around 150 years. Thus, we still react differently today.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, there also exists an anto-Sephardic bias in the Ashkenazik community (see: <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/06/24/somewhat-on-the-lighter-side/">Somewhat  On The Lighter Side</a>). Perhaps the Ashkenazic community does not consider anti-Jewish activity that harms Sephardic Jews &#8220;anti-Semitism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Perhaps not. It&#8217;s just a thought.</p>
<p><em>(Either way, I recommend </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0385513984?tag=eliyfink-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0385513984&amp;adid=08VJ6CN5645XHVXWS555&amp;"><em>Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean</em></a><em>. It&#8217;s a fun read and I plan another post about the episode in the book that had the biggest impact on me.)</em></p>

<p>There is a healthy nostalgia built into Judaism. &#8220;Chadesh yameni k&#8217;kedem&#8221; &#8211; renew our days to the way things were, we say. Of course, like any good thing, too much nostalgia is a bad thing.</p>
<p>After reading the famous case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio">Brandenburg v. Ohio</a> I find myself pining for the anti-Jewish sentiment as expressed in 60&#8217;s as opposed to today.</p>
<div>Brandenburg was a Ku Klux Klan leader in Ohio. At a KKK rally, men dressed in robes and hoods burned a cross and made public declarations of hate.<span id="more-2567"></span> Among their offensive epithets:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bury the niggers&#8221;, &#8220;Freedom for the whites&#8221;, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get them back to the dark garden&#8221;,</p></blockquote>
<p>(see FN1 in the Court opinion for the complete list) all clearly anti-black statements that are highly offensive.</p>
</div>
<div>Of course, no good KKK rally is complete without some anti-Jewish fun as well. These KKK Jew haters proclaimed:</div>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Send the Jews back to Israel&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Today&#8217;s anti-Jewish proclamations are more likely to echo Helen Thomas and say &#8220;Get the Jews out of Israel&#8221;.</div>
<div>Oh how I yearn for the anti-semites of yore. They were so much nicer to us&#8230;</div>

<p>If you are like me, you have been reading about the Rubashkin saga for months. What began with a Federal raid at a meat processing plant to ferret out hundreds of illegal alien employees is now culminating with a federal and state trial.<a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/anti-semitic-poster1.jpg"> (</a><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26626858" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing that the raid was &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; and fueled by anti-semitism.</p>
<div>
<p>If you are like me you have been hearing that he was denied bail because of an anti-semitic fear that Rubashkin was a flight risk and would flee to Israel.</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing that his federal sentencing recommendation was anti-semitic. (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/us/29postville.html" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>If you are like me, you have been hearing how the county jail was anti-semitic in not providing food that was kosher &#8220;to Rubashkin&#8217;s standards&#8221; and not permitting him to wear religious garb (tzitzis / tzitzit). (<a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20100509/NEWS/5090342/Rubashkin-dispute-highlights-faith-issue" target="_blank">Link</a>)</p>
<p>I have three things I want to say.<span id="more-2466"></span></p>
<p>1) I feel terribly for Rubashkin. I feel terribly for any criminal who is sentenced to prison but more-so when the criminal is a family member of mine. As a fellow Jew, Rubashkin is family and it pains me to see him in this state. I support asking for leniency is a mentshlach way.</p>
<p>2) Rubashkin is the cause of much of the animosity towards him from the prosecution and judiciary. It is NOT, I repeat, NOT because he is Jewish, nor is it anti-semitic.</p>
<p>3) Even those who cry anti-semitism in this case are grossly misusing the term.</p>
<p>I think #1 is a well represented opinion throughout the Jewish community. It does not require any more attention from me. Consider me to have said &#8220;ditto&#8221;.</p>
<p>Number 2 is something that has been so wildly misunderstood it almost seems blatant. The reason Rubashkin&#8217;s plant was raided was NOT due to a plan hatched in the bowels of a Ku Klux Klan facility. The reason his plant was raided was because he snubbed the Unions by hiring illegals and the Unions were none-too-happy. They made the infractions known to the Feds and they raided the plant. Were there too many helicopters and fancy weapons? Probably. Was it anti-semitic? Probably not. The people who make these kinds of choices don&#8217;t, actually, CAN&#8217;T have vendettas against minorities. This is the Federal Government of the most benevolent host the Jewish people have ever had. Use your noodle people! There is no conspiracy! Who was president at the time? Our best friend George W. Bush. The federal agents were in his employ. Dare we think that the &#8220;anti-semitic raid&#8221; was orchestrated by our dear friend? Of course not.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Rubashkin was considered a flight-risk because agents found $10,000 cash in a packed bag with passports. Under normal circumstances that is a flight-risk. A packed bag with cash and passports could be reasonably interpreted as a &#8220;just-in-case&#8221; bag. Maybe it was a &#8220;just-in-case Moshiach comes bag&#8221;. I am willing to believe that was the case. But what would you think if you saw that bag and he wasn&#8217;t a frum Jew? Is it anti-semitism to draw the logical conclusion from finding that bag and denying him bail? Certainly not.</p>
<p>The sentencing recommendation was well within Federal guidelines. I was talking about the case to a lawyer friend of mine who works for the Court of Appeals and who knew nothing about the case. I told him some of the facts about the bank fraud. His immediate reaction was, &#8220;that&#8217;s a life sentence&#8221;. He didn&#8217;t know the crook was a Jew. He didn&#8217;t know the crook was accused of other crimes. He only knew about the bank fraud and he said &#8220;that&#8217;s a life sentence&#8221;. Is he anti-semitic? Who cares?! He didn&#8217;t know the cases involved a Jew when he said a life sentence was what the crook deserved!</p>
<p>Also, much has been made of &#8220;comparable criminals&#8221;. It is an unfair comparison because Rubashkin has not been cooperative. He was not willing to accept any plea deals. He maintains his complete, 100% innocence and is a difficult person for the court to deal with. He has many special requests and claims he is being victimized. He has offered only one half-baked apology since this saga began and has not taken any responsibility.</p>
<p>While in jail, Rubashkin has made special requests. Some have been honored and some have not. Some of the requests that have been honored and he has stated that he not satisfied with the kashrus of the food. It is kosher, just not kosher enough. Is it anti-semitic if they give him kosher food that most orthodox Jews would eat?</p>
<p>Also, Rubashkin will not walk without wearing Tzitzis. He states that his religion will not allow him to walk. So he has been carried around so that he will not violate this religious law. The problem is that he is with ignorant of the law or is just trying to be annoying. The law is that when one wears a four-cornered garment (think of a poncho or rectangular wrap) the garment must have a certain formula of strings attached to the garment at the corners. One is not required to wear such a garment. However it has become customary to wear one of these garments with the strings attached for prayer as well as during the day. But if you are not wearing a four-cornered garment the law does not require that you wear the strings (like a button-down shirt or blazer don&#8217;t need the strings). So why is Rubashkin making a stink out of an issue that is not religious? Is it anti-semitic if the jail does not cooperate with this?</p>
<p>I think it is clear enough that for every &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; act against Rubashkin, there is a plausible non-anti-semitic explanation as well. Let&#8217;s just stop with the anti-semitism cries.</p>
<p>As for #3, I dare you to look a Holocaust survivor in the eye and call this anti-semitism. Try telling it to a Jew who was thrown out of Spain and Portugal for not bowing to the Cross. Or how about Jews who were slaughtered during pogroms? Being prosecuted for actual crimes is not anti-semitism. Anti-semitism is hatred and cruelty to Jews for no reason other than the fact that they are Jewish. That is not the case here.</p>
<p>I have more to say about anti-semitism in general. Stay tuned&#8230;</p>

<p>Nothing like a Supreme Court of the United States nomination to get me to blog again.</p>
<p>Elena Kagan has been nominated for the SCOTUS. I have no opinion about her. I do have an opinion about some of the people opposing her&#8230;</p>
<p>I have been planning a brief series on anti-semitism. This post will be the first of a few that deal with various specifics and nuances of anti-semitism in my opinion.</p>
<p>Have you seen the <a href="http://innate-differences.blogspot.com/2010/05/one-picture-worth-1000-kikes.html" target="_blank">cries of anti-semitism</a> connected with Kagan? They come from Orthodox Jews who have trouble dealing with their own insecurities. Why?<span id="more-2452"></span></p>
<p>Most RW Jews are very conservative politically. Kagan is not. Her existence and certainly her appointment the SCOTUS is not viewed favorably in their eyes. Subconsciously, they need a way to protest her appointment and the first thing that pops into their minds is the old &#8220;anti-semitism card&#8221;.</p>
<p>People point to the caricature of her as anti-semitic. People think that it is reminiscent of Nazi propaganda.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Nazi propaganda was general. It showed Jews as having certain features and overemphasized those features in order to make a separate point. &#8220;Jews steal&#8221;, &#8220;Jews are like vermin&#8221;, &#8220;Jews run the world&#8221;, etc. The caricature was to paint a villain with gross features and then label the villain with gross acts. It works better than painting the villain with gross acts with a face like Clooney or Pitt&#8230;</p>
<p>The cartoon of Kagan is just a cartoon. It exaggerates her features because those are HER features. It&#8217;s the same way a Leno cartoon has a huge chin and Bush cartoon has a squat head and long ears. It pokes fun at their appearance but is in no way anti-long chin or anti-squat head with long ears. Accentuating Kagan&#8217;s features in a cartoon can&#8217;t be off limits because she happens to be Jewish.</p>
<p>A second thing about all this anti-semitism talk is very ironic. I have not seen any reports from mainstream media that even mentions that Kagan is Jewish. It is not an issue for most people. Why do we think that it is an issue? It&#8217;s like we invent an issue to get upset about. Kagan was chosen because of her credentials and the diversity she brings to the court. Doesn&#8217;t that champion minorities like Jews? How is that anti-semitic!?</p>
<p>The last thing I want to address is the complaint lodged by a commenter on DovBear&#8217;s post. Mamzer Talmid Chacham said &#8220;I&#8217;d still like it better if he nominated someone who was actually a judge&#8221;. It so happens that one of the greatest SCOTUS justices of all time, Justice Warren, was not a judge. One large criticism of the SCOTUS is the seemingly similar paths all the justices took to get to the court. Choosing Kagan adds another element of much needed diversity to the court.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1571 alignleft" title="Santa Monica Pier" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/WA66SantaMonicaPier.jpg?resize=240%2C160" alt="Santa Monica Pier" data-recalc-dims="1" />We took the family to Santa Monica Pier on Sunday and our six year old son proved to be smarter than a Supreme Court Justice!</p>
<p>It is so beautiful to walk along the beach and observe all the excitement along the boardwalk and pier. As always, we had a great time in Santa Monica.</p>
<p>For the last few years there has been a protest / exhibit just north of the pier. The protestors are against war in general, the Iraq war in specific and pretty much the entire defense budget of the United States.</p>
<p>They call it <a href="http://www.arlingtonwestsantamonica.org/" target="_blank">Arlington West</a> and they have set up a faux graveyard in the sand representing the fallen soldiers in what they call a criminal war.<span id="more-1568"></span></p>
<p>It can be quite powerful when you see it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1570" title="Arlington West" src="http://i1.wp.com/66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_0357.jpg?resize=640%2C480" alt="Arlington West" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>As we walked by the lines and lines of crosses on this occasion, my 6 year old son asks, &#8220;How do they know all the soldiers who died were Christian? If they were Jewish or Muslim or &#8216;nothing&#8217; they probably wouldn&#8217;t want a cross.&#8221;</p>
<p>Excellent point kiddo! Score one for the six year old.</p>
<p>In fact you may have heard about this exact issue arising in the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Salazar v. Buono</em>. The issue in the case is an eight-foot high cross that was erected as a memorial to fallen soldiers in foreign wars.</p>
<p>The case made recent headlines when Justice Scalia could not fathom that a non-Christian would perhaps be offended by a Christian symbol as a memorial for the dead. The exchange between Justice Scalia and ACLU lawyer Peter J. Eliasburg went something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>JUSTICE SCALIA: The cross doesn&#8217;t honor non-Christians who fought in the war? Is that &#8212; is that &#8212;</em></p>
<p><em>MR. ELIASBERG: I believe that&#8217;s actually correct.</em></p>
<p><em>JUSTICE SCALIA: Where does it say that?</em></p>
<p><em>MR. ELIASBERG: It doesn&#8217;t say that, but a cross is the predominant symbol of Christianity and it signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to redeem mankind for our sins, and I believe that&#8217;s why the Jewish war veterans &#8212;</em></p>
<p><em>JUSTICE SCALIA: It&#8217;s erected as a war memorial. I assume it is erected in honor of all of the war dead. It&#8217;s the &#8212; the cross is the &#8212; is the most common symbol of &#8212; of &#8212; of the resting place of the dead, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to me &#8212; what would you have them erect? A cross &#8212; some conglomerate of a cross, a Star of David, and you know, a Moslem half moon and star?</em></p>
<p><em>MR. ELIASBERG: Well, Justice Scalia, if I may go to your first point. The cross is the most common symbol of the resting place of Christians. I have been in Jewish cemeteries. There is never a cross on a tombstone of a Jew. (Laughter.)</em></p>
<p><em>MR. ELIASBERG: So it is the most common symbol to honor Christians.</em></p>
<p><em>JUSTICE SCALIA: I don&#8217;t think you can leap from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that that cross honors are the Christian war dead. I think that&#8217;s an outrageous conclusion.</em></p>
<p><em>MR. ELIASBERG: Well, my &#8212; the point of my &#8212; point here is to say that there is a reason the Jewish war veterans came in and said we don&#8217;t feel honored by this cross. This cross can&#8217;t honor us because it is a religious symbol of another religion.</em></p>

<p>DovBear posted about this last week (<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/10/impeach-scalia.html" target="_blank">Impeach Scalia</a>) click for discussion there.</p>
<p>What amazes me is how my 6 year old son can see something so patently obvious and yet Justice Scalia can&#8217;t seem to process the concept&#8230;</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1043" title="Giants Stadium" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Giants-Stadium-1.jpg?resize=300%2C214" alt="Giants Stadium" data-recalc-dims="1" />A few months ago, the New York Jets football team <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/jets/2009/04/15/2009-04-15_jewish_fans_jolt_jets_nfl.html" target="_blank">made headlines </a>when they moved they 4 PM Sunday game on Erev (the day before) Yom Kippur to 1 PM. This time change would give Jewish people wishing to observe Yom Kippur the opportunity to be home before the start of Yom Kippur at sundown on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>This was a nice gesture. It was also, completely unnecessary as Jews are comfortable with and used to compromising to satisfy their Religious beliefs. Jews who keep kosher often cannot eat at business lunches and Shabbos observant Jews miss live college football every Saturday in the fall. Missing a Jets game the day before Yom Kippur is not that big a deal. Plus, it is like a badge of courage to miss an event for your religion. Just ask <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Koufax.html" target="_blank">Sandy Koufax</a>. Missing the game is not that big a deal. Yet, the change was made.</p>
<p>Now it seems that this decision by the Jets is causing a bit of a problem.</p>
<p><span id="more-1042"></span><a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/its-a-mitzvah-u2-reschedules-concert-because-of-jets-game-and-jewish-holiday/" target="_blank">NY Times Arts Beat Blog</a> is reporting that this minor schedule change by the Jets is affecting thousands of people. The award winning band, U2 had scheduled a concert in the same stadium the Jets use (ironically, called Giants Stadium) for the Friday before Yom Kippur. Thousands of fans made travel plans, inlcuding flights and hotels ot make thier U2 pilgrimage and see the band&#8217;s live show. That Friday night show has been canceled and moved two days earlier to Wednesday. According to U2&#8217;s piblicist, the change was needed to make the show logistically possible, due to the now earlier Jets game, they were concerned that the field would not be ready for the Jets on Sunday.</p>
<p>As U2 lead singer and social activist, Bono, croons in &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCzccXAF8Lo" target="_blank">City of Blinding Lights</a>&#8220;,<em> blessing&#8217;s not just for the ones who kneel, luckily. </em>Meaning, all prayers are valuable, not just the &#8220;kneelers&#8221; (I assume <em>&#8220;ones who kneel&#8221;</em> means Christians for whom the kneel is a contemporary prayer pose). So, Bono is just respecting the Jews right? Maybe.</p>
<p>But, there is an elephant in the room. Thousands of U2 fans are being inconvenienced. Thousands of U2 fans are going to need to make alternate travel plans and will lose money because of this change in schedule.</p>
<p>That is not fair. It may even be grounds for a law suit. Who knows? Ask your local lawyer for some insight into promissory estoppel and breach of contract.</p>
<p>More importantly, for people like me this has spawned an outrage from U2 fans and others on the NY Time Arts Beats Blog and I am sure other places as well. Now I get to read Jew friendly comments like <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/its-a-mitzvah-u2-reschedules-concert-because-of-jets-game-and-jewish-holiday/#comment-122223" target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/its-a-mitzvah-u2-reschedules-concert-because-of-jets-game-and-jewish-holiday/#comment-122229" target="_blank">this</a> from rightfully angry fans.</p>
<p>Disturbing as well, is the headline for the blog post on NY Times: It&#8217;s a Mitzvah&#8221;, insinuating that changing the concert date is a good deed. I disagree. It is not a mitzvah to cause financial harm to innocent U2 fans.</p>
<p>There is one more thing that nags at me about all this. The Jets made their change months ago. U2 knew about the change months ago. Changing the date now may be necessary but it should have been done at the time the Jets made their schedule change. By not making the change and then crossing their fans by changing the date after fans have already made plans and then &#8220;blaming&#8221; it on a Jewish holiday (it says in the <a href="http://www.u2.com/news/title/scheduling-change-for-giants-stadium-performance" target="_blank">press release</a> &#8220;out of respect for the Jewish faith&#8221;) gives Jew haters (<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090826213103AA4oUA7" target="_blank">like this guy</a>) the opening they need to spew their venom. That is just not right.</p>
<p>Take the blame yourself. Don&#8217;t blame it on us. That is certainly not a mitzvah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This post has been cross-posted to DovBear &#8211; <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/08/mesira-informant-in-jewish-law.html" target="_blank">more discussion there</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p>The topic of mesira is complex. I do not claim expertise on the subject of who is a moser, but I have heard a discourse from an expert on Jewish and American Law named <a href="http://www.wsat.org/therav.htm" target="_blank">Rabbi Breitowitz</a>. Aside from teaching law at University of Maryland, Rabbi Breitowitz is a practicing Rabbi in Silver Spring Maryland. When I lived in Baltimore, I heard Rabbi Breitowitz speak on the topic of mesira and I was able to find the same speech online to refresh my memory.</p>
<p>This is my basic understanding of his take on mesira.<span id="more-1000"></span></p>
<p>He mentions three contemporary positions, Reb Moshe Feinstein, the Aruch HaShulchan and Rav Wosner.</p>
<p>He begins with Reb Moshe. Reb Moshe holds that there is a prohibition of mesira when the secular punishment is worse than the Torah&#8217;s punishment. A moser has a halachic status of a rodef, one who is trying to kill another, and must be stopped from his mesira. There are 3 big exceptions. 1) When the person about whom the moser is speaking of is a rodef himself. This is because a person who kills a rodef is not a killer nor is his act of attempting to kill the rodef is not considered a rodef. As an aside, a sexual or physical abuser is considered a halachic rodef and thus there is no prohibition of mesira in those situations. 2) If the moser is preventing a major communal disaster then there is no prohibition. 3) If it one&#8217;s job to inform, then mesira will not apply.</p>
<p>This is the most narrow view of when one is permitted to be moser that Rabbi Breitowitz mentions.</p>
<p>The Aruch Hashulchan says in a footnote to section 318 in Choshen Mishpat that in a benevolent and fair country where there is a justice system that does not unfairly imprison Jews, one is not guilty of mesira by informing the government of a fellow Jew&#8217;s crimes. He continues by saying &#8220;for example in wonderful Czarist Russia&#8221;. There is a question as to the seriousness of this footnote as he could not have possibly meant that Czarist Russia was fair and benevolent. The question is whether the entire footnote has value or if the entire thing was a false gesture of good faith to the Czar. It is not likely that the Aruch Hashulchan would add a deliberately misleading footnote and the reasoning of his footnote stands whether his country was wonderful or not. Thus, the Tzitz Eliezer holds that the Aruch Hashulchan means that wherever there is a &#8220;procedural justice&#8221; there is no mesira.</p>
<p>The third opinion is that of Rav Wosner. His approach integrates the rules of dina d&#8217;malchusa dina with mesira. His reasoning is that when the non-Jews follow the Noachide law of creating a set of laws it becomes a halachic basis for the Jew to obey those laws. Thus, he concludes that it cannot be possible to violate the prohibition of mesira if one is following the laws of their country. Since, he must follow the laws of that country his mesira is not against halacha. This does not mean one is required to be a moser, rather the reporting is not a violation of mesira.</p>
<p>It is necessary to define when dina d&#8217;milchusa dina constitutes to determine when mesira is not prohibited according to Rav Wosner. The Mechaber says that dina d&#8217;malchusa dina is limited to government interests. The Rama disagrees and says that it applies to anything that is designed to promote the well being of society. Most poskim agree with this definition which includes but is not limited to, criminal law, minimum wage laws, environmental laws and child labor laws.</p>
<p>In conclusion, mesira is a term bandied about to protect our own criminals. In reality, it is very difficult to pin down a halachic moser according to the Aruch Hashulchan or Rav Wosner and although it is possible according to Reb Moshe to be a moser it is still unlikely. We need to be honest with ourselves and stop hiding behind archaic halachic terms to justify false ideas.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately, all the Jews in the News have been getting into <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/nyregion/24jersey.html?_r=1&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=dwek&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">trouble with the law</a> or <a href="../2009/08/04/rabbi-zelik-epstein-of-blessed-memory/" target="_blank">dying</a>. It has been troubling.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we wonder what other people are saying about us. In light of the last few weeks, it just can&#8217;t be good.</p>
<p>This recent (true) anecdote is a change of pace and hopefully it can start a new trend.<span id="more-925"></span></p>
<p>Jessica* was driving her car down a Monsey road. Her route was taking her past a non-Jewish camp called Camp Sunshine*. On this particular day Camp Sunshine had a camp trip and as it happens, the buses with the campers was a little late and the camp parents were waiting to pick up their children.</p>
<p>A woman was directing traffic. Her concern was that the parents should not get into the camp before the buses arrived because the buses would not be able to enter to camp. She was stopping traffic in all directions and tryiong to direct the buses around the cars so that the buses could enter and then she would allow the cars to enter.</p>
<p>Unluckily for her, no one was listening to her. People were driving by at high speeds cursing her out as they passed. Irate camp parents were yelling at her as if she could magically conjure the buses into the camp.</p>
<p>Jessica was not going to Camp Sunshine but as she passed the woman who was directing traffic told her to stop. Jessica followed instructions and stopped as people behind her swerved around her ignoring the traffic directing woman. Eventually, people began to stop and order was restored. As the lines of cars waited peacefully for the buses.</p>
<p>The woman struck up conversation with Jessica, they lamented the lack of order, but Jessica reassured her that it was okay, no one is really upset with her and she was doing the right thing. They had a nice 10-15 minute conversation while the buses made their way into camp.</p>
<p>Eventually, traffice was ready to resume and Jessica was being directed into the camp. She stuck out her head and told the woman, &#8220;I am actually going somewhere else, can I pass?&#8221;. The woman nearly fell over. She exclaimed &#8220;You mean, you waited this entire time and you are not even coming into Camp Sunshine?&#8221;. Jessica replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>The woman came over to Jessica&#8217;s car and said: &#8220;I see that you are an Orthodox Jew. Everyone around here has been talking about the Jewish criminals, the dishonesty and anti-social behavior that we have seen around town. You know what? I am going to tell them all about you. I see that not all Orthodox Jews are like that. They need to know that there are people like you too.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is the small things that show the world that we are not represented by some hooligans on CNN.</p>
<p>As Ghandi said &#8220;Be the change you wish to see in the world&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong><em>Be the Kiddush Hashem you want to see in others.</em></strong></p>
<p>And yes, everyone is watching us.</p>
<p><em>*names have been changed</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a Law Student, there are things I find interesting that may not interest &#8220;clients&#8221; (non-Lawyers, hehe). The following article interests me and will probably interest any lawyer or law student, anyone Jewish, or anyone that has been following the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073003563.html" target="_blank">Gates Saga</a>.</p>
<p>I invite you to contribute your opinion in the comments.</p>
<p>The article originally appeared in this week&#8217;s <a href="http://jewishpress.com" target="_blank">Jewish Press</a> as an OP-ED. The writer is Nathan Lewin (<a href="http://www.lewinlewin.com/nathan.html" target="_blank">read more about him here</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><span id="more-922"></span><a href="http://www.jewishpress.com/pageroute.do/40250" target="_blank">WHAT IF GATES WERE AN UNRENOWNED JEWISH BLACK WOMAN?</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nathan Lewin</strong></p>
<p>Posted Jul 29 2009</p>
<p><strong> </strong>Soon after Cambridge police arrested and handcuffed Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. on a disorderly conduct charge, they realized the black man they wanted to prosecute was a renowned academic. As a result, he was released and the charges against him were dropped.</p>
<p>The ensuing public debate &#8211; in which Cambridge authorities now try to justify arresting a man because he refused to comply in his own home with police directions and deny that race had any influence on how the police reacted &#8211; suggests that if an ordinary black homeowner, rather than a Harvard professor, had been arrested under these circumstances, the criminal charges would not have been dropped so readily.</p>
<p>Consider the pending case of Rivka &#8211; a black, very dark-skinned, extremely devout Orthodox Jewish woman. Rivka is employed in New York, spends <em>Shabbat </em>in Washington, and her work frequently takes her on extended trips overseas. Being single and in her mid-fifties, she rented a 3-bedroom apartment on the West Side of Manhattan, and advertised on Craigslist for female roommates willing to accept short subleases. All applicants were informed by Rivka that the apartment was strictly kosher. A special page prescribing the <em>kashrut </em>rules was added to the lease that each roommate signed.</p>
<p>The rules were followed by a series of women Rivka accepted as roommates. In July 2007, a white blond-haired girl named Brooke answered Rivka&#8217;s ad and signed a five-month lease with the <em>kashrut </em>provisions. Brooke promptly violated the <em>kashrut</em> rules and admitted, in sworn testimony, that she brought nonkosher food into the apartment in knowing violation of her signed agreement. Rivka told Brooke she would have to leave.</p>
<p>Having e-mailed Brooke that she had arranged, at her &#8211; Rivka&#8217;s &#8211; expense, for a hotel room where Brooke could stay while she was looking for other accommodations, and believing that Brooke had agreed to have her belongings transported to the other location, Rivka began moving Brooke&#8217;s clothing to the hotel. Brooke arrived at the apartment unexpectedly and called the local precinct, reporting, &#8220;My roommate is currently stealing stuff out of my room.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Rivka returned after depositing Brooke&#8217;s belongings in the reserved hotel room, she found two policemen at the apartment with Brooke. The senior police officer (who is white), testified that Rivka showed them the lease and the e-mail she had sent to Brooke, and explained that she had moved Brooke&#8217;s belongings to the nearby hotel because she had an agreement with Brooke to do so. Rivka insisted to the officers that she wanted Brooke out of the apartment. The officers testified that Rivka interrupted her conversation with them to spend ten minutes in prayer.</p>
<p>Rivka then left the officers and retreated to her bedroom and locked her door. The officers demanded that she come out. On her cell phone, Rivka called a friend from the Georgetown Synagogue in Washington who had a law degree but was not in private practice. He told her to ask the officers for a warrant and for their precincts and badge numbers. The white policeman said in his testimony that he &#8220;did not recall&#8221; whether he gave his precinct and badge number.</p>
<p>When Rivka did not emerge voluntarily from her bedroom, the sergeant called the Emergency Services Unit &#8211; the police department&#8217;s riot squad. They came in full force, with more than one dozen policemen. They broke down the door to Rivka&#8217;s bedroom, dragged her into the hall and up against the wall at gunpoint, handcuffed her, and then took her downstairs to a waiting ambulance.</p>
<p>The ambulance drove to a nearby hospital. One of the officers tried to have her committed to the psychiatric unit. After an examination, the hospital said there was no basis to admit her. The police then took Rivka to the police precinct, where she was permitted one phone call. She called a person she had befriended while regularly attending <em>Shabbat</em> services at the Georgetown Synagogue, but the arresting police officer hung up the telephone in the middle of Rivka&#8217;s call.</p>
<p>Rivka was then taken to another hospital, where she was handcuffed to a bed. Next morning, she was returned to the precinct. The rabbi at the New York synagogue she attends on weekdays heard of her plight and brought a kosher meal to the precinct &#8211; the first meal Rivka had since her arrest the day before.</p>
<p>Rivka was charged with &#8220;Obstruction of Governmental Administration in the Second Degree&#8221; and with &#8220;Unlawful Eviction.&#8221; The New York D.A.&#8217;s office refused to dismiss the charges even after all the facts were presented. The young prosecutor first demanded that Rivka plead guilty and perform community service and ultimately was willing to accept an unconditional &#8220;Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal.&#8221; Rivka refused to accept any terms other than outright dismissal because she insisted she had done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>The case went to a nonjury trial before a (white) judge who was a former prosecutor. He excluded much defense testimony as irrelevant and hearsay and rejected out of hand Rivka&#8217;s right to remain in her own bedroom after her discussion with the police. At the end of the trial, he found Rivka guilty on both counts and fined her $500. Rivka is appealing.</p>
<p>Would the police have broken the bedroom door of a white gentile and charged her with crimes after being called to a dispute between her and a roommate? Is this another instance &#8211; as the Gates arrest is said to be &#8211; of injustice against blacks, aggravated by Rivka&#8217;s Jewish identity?</p>
<p>Rivka is suing New York City, the policemen, and Brooke in federal court. The docket number of her case is 08 Civ. 10065. I am her lawyer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite gadget blogs ran a despicable headline for a post yesterday. Gizmodo is a great blog when it comes to getting information, reviews and opinions on the latest technology and gadgets. Unfortunately, yesterday they disgraced their reputation with a pretty offensive headline.</p>
<p>The headline garnered enough attention that they ultimately changed it to something less offensive.</p>
<p><span id="more-881"></span>There is a normal Orthodox Jewish couple who have a vacation home. Originally, the building did not have motion sensing lights but recently changed the system to a motion sensing system. On Shabbos the couple did not wish to be forced to walk in a hallway that would trigger the lights on. They requested the building swap the new system for the old one at their expense. The building refused. The couple sued.</p>
<p>Gizmodo posted the following headline: &#8220;Orthodox Couple Imprisoned By Superstition Blame Motion Sensing Light Instead&#8221;.</p>
<p>Proof:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-876 aligncenter" title="giz superstition" src="http://i1.wp.com/rabbifink.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/giz-superstition.jpg?resize=426%2C200" alt="giz superstition" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Subsequently, the headline was changed to &#8220;<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5317968/orthodox-jewish-couple-sues-over-motion+sensing-light" target="_blank">Orthodox Jewish Couple Sues Over Motion Sensing Light</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink" target="_blank">I posted the link on Facebook </a>hoping to get some comments from my Facebook friends. I got a few interesting responses.</p>
<p>One commenter hit the two points that I want to discuss on this blog.</p>
<p>1 &#8211; The halachic ramifications of motion sensors and Shabbos for the Orthodox Jew.</p>
<p>2 &#8211; The reaction of a non-Jew to a halacha adherent Jew.</p>
<p>I do not want to get into a nitty gritty halachic discourse of motion sensors on Shabbos. Suffice to say, the issue is not black and white. On Shabbos one may not act in a way that will automatically produce a desired result that violates Shabbos. Completing a circuit to turn on a light is a violation of Shabbos. By activated the sensor, one automatically produced the desired result of turning on the light.</p>
<p>There is leeway when the result is not automatic or when the result is not desired.</p>
<p>I am all for striving to keep halacha. When I am met with a choice between what I want and what halacha demands I try my best to choose halacha. So for example, if I am driving late at night and I pull into a rest stop and they have a fast food joint serving burgers that are not kosher I have a choice. I want a burger but halacha demands that my burgers be kosher. I choose to leave the rest stop burgerless. I will not sue the restaurant for not providing kosher burgers. Right?</p>
<p>Now, I know this is a little different from the vacation home. But, it is the same principle. If halacha will not allow for me act a certain way, guess what? I am not going to act that way. Even if I really, really, really want to. So, I know that in the vacation home there are other factors, such as broken promises and flawed reasoning. However, if it were me, or anyone that I advise I would trade that place for a new one.</p>
<p>Adhering to halacha is about making a choice to allow halacha to control your life and not your whims and desires at any given moment. There will be times where the choice is hard or the alternative is very tempting, those are the times where you show your strength of character by making what you believe to be the right choice. Those are not the times to sue because you have been made uncomfortable in your adherence to halacha.</p>
<p>There may be great merit to the lawsuit. I find that all irrelevant. I think, avoiding a legal brouhaha over halacha is more important than the principle of who is right and who is wrong in this situation.</p>
<p>Second, the offensive headline that originally appeared on Gizmodo bothered me. I am NOT an overly sensitive person. I do not cry &#8220;Anti-Semitism at every opportunity I get (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/06/matza-in-the-ny-times-and-in-our-times/#more-440" target="_blank">ala Uncle Leo</a>). I don&#8217;t even call this &#8220;Anti-Semitism&#8221;, I call this insensitivity.</p>
<p>There is nothing against Jewish people, per se, when calling religion a superstition. But there is a tremendous breach of sensitivity.</p>
<p>Gizmodo writer, Jack Lofton doesn&#8217;t believe in religion in general and that&#8217;s okay. I am not going to call him names about his lack of faith or question his theology publicly. That is just not appropriate for a gadget blog. If he were writing on a religion blog, or even an anti-religion blog then Jack&#8217;s opinion about religion might be relevant. Here, it was not and inserting his bigoted opinion was insensitive.</p>
<p>I do not read the headline as an affront to Judaism or even religion in general. I read the headline as an affront to civility.</p>
<p>We live in a big world, with a lot of people. Not everyone is going to agree. You can try and convince everyone you are right or lash out against those who do not. But ultimately, we are not all going to agree. So let agree on this, let&#8217;s choose not to fight about our disagreements and otherwise be friends. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/19/atheists-and-believers-la-times-smackdown/" target="_blank">I mantioned this revolutionary concept on this blog a little while ago</a>. We have more in common than not. Let&#8217;s stop fighting about God, or anything else we feel strongly about and move on.</p>
<p>Also, Jack, Gizmodo is the wrong place to make your point about religion.</p>
<p>Time and place, Jack. Showing your prejudice against religion is ugly, it is especially ugly when it is not at all connected to the content of your post. I read Gizmodo for technology news and content. Just because you have a soapbox does not mean you can shout whatever you want whenever you want. Time and place.</p>
<p>Jack, please don&#8217;t make fun of other people&#8217;s beliefs on one of my favorite gadget blogs. Thanks.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: To his credit, </em><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5317968/orthodox-jewish-couple-sues-over-motion+sensing-light" target="_blank"><em>the writer apologized.</em></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>UPDATE: Friday morning 6/25/09 I updated the post to more accurately reflect the protagonist&#8217;s personality.</em></p>
<p>I am so disturbed right now.</p>
<p>My wife and I have a summer camp for pre-school children in Monsey NY. That is why we left Los Angeles / Venice for the summer. We don&#8217;t own our own camp grounds so during the year we store everything in a shed at my in-laws&#8217; home in Monsey.</p>
<p>Sometime before camp begins we need to get everything from the in-laws to our summer location. Today was moving day. What I heard during the move was disturbing enough to share with you.</p>
<p><span id="more-802"></span></p>
<p>We hired a fellow who runs a local moving outfit called B!ny@m!n the Shlepper (BTS). He&#8217;s been doing this for 20 years and he basically manages the move while he sits in his truck and his workers do the &#8220;Shlepping&#8221;, he pays them quite well for their work and then takes his profit. Much of his work is in the Frum community. BTS is not known as a cordial guy to most (he is not a jerk, just not the most personable guy) (AND I think <em>they</em> are wrong) and has had his share of run-ins (customers refusing to pay, customers yelling at him etc) with his customers.</p>
<p>Today, I made an error in my estimated items needing to be moved. Immediately his sensors go off &#8211; &#8220;is this another Frum guy trying to rip me off?&#8221;. Of course it was an honest mistake and I was willing to pay for the extra work.</p>
<p>I apologized profusely. He goes off on a (perfectly understandable) tirade, &#8220;you don&#8217;t think I am a person&#8221;, &#8220;you people always try to cheat me&#8221; etc. I continued to apologize and we began to talk.</p>
<p>BTS tells me horrible stories of externally observant Jews who have cheated him, spoken rudely with him and treated him like a second class citizen. He drives a large moving truck and when he drives and traffic is jammed, he notes that he gets cut off all the time. He also notes that he gets cut off all the time by religiously dressed Jews. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t they just let me go first?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, Binyamin is actually not Frum himself. Very spiritual and personal growth, but not religious. What he can&#8217;t understand is why people who claim to be religious and perform mitzvos all the time, very often lack common courtesy and decency.</p>
<p>As we talk I see past the outer crust of his personality and beyond the veneer he is truly a wonderful guy. We laughed together, told some great stories and even a little bit of Torah was discussed. We really had a great conversation and I was actually disappointed when the job was over and our shmooze had to end.</p>
<p>In response to his complaints about externally religious Jews, I remarked that they are so busy being religious they forget to be human! ©</p>
<p>The truth is, I was embarrassed that this Jewish guy had such a bad feeling about religious Jews.We spoke for a while and I tried to assure him that he doesn&#8217;t notice all the great things. I also tried to remind him that all the negative stuff he hears sticks out to him, but people don&#8217;t remember when others act appropriately.</p>
<p>Bottom line, it was damage control.</p>
<p>Folks, get your priorities straight!</p>
<p>Step One: Act like decent human being. &#8211; Derech Eretz Kadma L&#8217;Torah, <em>common courtesy precedes Torah</em>.</p>
<p>Step Two: Integrate Torah and Mitzvos into your life.</p>
<p>Rinse, wash, repeat.</p>
<p>If you dress like a religious Jew, you are expected to act like it. It boggles my mind how insensitive, unaware and obtuse some Torah observant Jews can be. The same Torah that says keep Kosher, lay Tefillin, observe Shabbos, study Torah, Shofar, Lulav, Yom Kippur ALSO says to treat people with respect, honor our planet, act humanely towards animals and love your neighbor. We need to work on keeping all of those.</p>
<p>Please, I beg you, realize that you are representing the Jewish people. Act like it.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>In addition to my work as the Rabbi at <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center at the </a><a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Shul</a><a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank"> on the Beach</a> I am also a Law Student at <a href="http://lls.edu">Loyola Law School</a> in Los Angeles. I am part of the evening program and completed my first year of evening classes in May.</p>
<p>In December I was subjected to mid-terms in each of my courses. Many Law School exams are long fact patterns that require the student to analyze the facts and apply all the law that is relevant to the facts and then argue why the law should or should not apply to those facts. Usually these fact patterns are fiction and these essays are typically 3 &#8211; 4 hours in duration.</p>
<p>My torts professor gave us a very interesting fact pattern. The basics of the case were, two young boys named Israel and Jacob enter an elevator on their way to school. Along the way the elevator malfunctions and the boys are suspended between the 10th and 11th floor. The doors malfunction as well and the doors are opened. The younger boy, Jacob is 5 and he tries to jump from the stuck elevator to the 10th floor below. Jacob jumps and <span id="more-783"></span>does not &#8220;<a href="http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/stick_the_landing_1/" target="_blank">stick the landing</a>&#8220;. Unfortunately, he stumbles off the 10th floor and plummeted 10 stories beneath the elevator down the shaft to his death. Israel is eventually rescued.</p>
<p>There were many more legally operative facts in the fact pattern and our professor wanted us to analyze the claims against the building landlord, owner and elevator maintenance company.</p>
<p>It was a pretty shocking case for all of us. When we returned to school after the break our professor told us that the fact pattern was basically a true story with some of the facts changed to make a clearer essay. Immediately I &#8220;googled&#8221; &#8220;Jacob Israel Elevator&#8221;. I found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/nyregion/20fall.html?scp=33&amp;sq=&amp;st=nyt" target="_blank">the original NY Times article with the tragic story</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Times had <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/13/nyregion/13elevator.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;sq=elevator&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1" target="_blank">another article on the ongoing litigation</a>. Apparently, the defense wants young Israel, who is 10 and traumatized to testify. This is horrible as any memories of the tragedy could alter his psychological well being tremendously. The case is being litigated as you read this.</p>
<p>I told this entire saga to two people I know. They are both very caring and sensitive people. They both had the same reaction and that reaction is what prompted this post.</p>
<p>When I told the story over, both people had serious looks on their faces and clearly empathized with the poor child.</p>
<p>Then I told them, by the way, the little boys were <em>Chasidish children from Williamsburg</em>.</p>
<p>They both had the same second reaction. Their jaws dropped and they exclaimed <em>Oy! That&#8217;s terrible</em>! A much harsher reaction reaction than before they knew the boys&#8217; ethnicity.</p>
<p>At first I was disturbed. Do we care more about some poor Chasidish kids from Williamsburg than anyone else? Is this tragedy worse to us because they are Jewish?</p>
<p>Is this a good attitude? Could this bother non-Jews and provoke anti-semitism?</p>
<p>Or, perhaps it is normal for us to care more about our Jewish brethren. Maybe, we should feel more compassion for our fellow Jews. After all, it is a rule of Jewish law that we are responsible for one another.</p>
<p>This has been gnawing at me for a little while now. Should we care more about a Jewish tragedy than a non-Jewish tragedy?</p>
<p>Even if we are allowed to care more about a Jewish tragedy should we try and mask our feelings to be more politically correct?</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t we outraged when non-Jews do not care about Jewish tragedy as much as non-Jewish tragedy?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em><a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/more-on-mid-east-jews.html" target="_blank">This post has been cross posted to DovBear</a> &#8211; great discussion there.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;">Do Anglo/American Jews care enough about our middle-eastern Jewish brothers and sisters?</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/criticism-of-obamas-speech-db-two.html" target="_blank">DovBear posted</a> a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/opinion/09aciman.html?_r=1" target="_blank">really great Op-Ed piece from the NY Times</a>.</p>
<p>In fact. before checking his blog I even emailed the article to him as I assumed he would find it interesting.</p>
<p>Of course, I was too late as it had already been posted!</p>
<p>What occurred subsequent to his posting of the article was even more interesting.<span id="more-761"></span></p>
<p>But first let&#8217;s go to the NY Times column. An exiled Egyptian Jew recounts the persecution his family experienced in Egypt. His issue is that President Obama took the time to mention the suffering of Palestinians and ignored the suffering of middle-eastern Jews outside of Israel. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/09/opinion/09aciman.html?_r=1" target="_blank">A worthwhile read</a>.</p>
<p>DovBear posted the article and it got very little attention from the commenters. As opposed to a three day running argument about Mesorah (<a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/why-accepting-late-date-for-proverbs-is.html">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/more-on-mishlei-mesorah.html" target="_blank">Part 2</a>, <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2009/06/were-amoraim-orthodox.html" target="_blank">Part 3</a>) that got hundreds and hundreds of comments.</p>
<p>On Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/DovBear/statuses/2091037902" target="_blank">DovBear posted this observation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Egyptian Jew criticizes Obama in Times oped. TBF [to be fair], when was the last time any Ashkenazi Jew shed a tear for what happened to MidEastJews?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink/statuses/2091133403" target="_blank">responded with my experience</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>R&#8217; Herman Neuberger dedicated YEARS of his life to save Iranian Jews. TBF &#8211; he not only shed tears, but years and saved thousands.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Which DovBear <a href="http://twitter.com/DovBear/statuses/2091226165" target="_blank">countered with a hilarious (and sad) take</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>kol hakovod [kudos] for your yachid [individual]. Average cholent fresser [eater] from flatbush doesn&#8217;t know and doesnt care.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that DovBear is right. Where is the outrage from Ashkenazic Jews? Why does it seem like we don&#8217;t care?</p>
<p>The rest of this post is dedicated to bringing awareness to the plight of middle-eastern Jewry and an invitation for those of you may have first hand information regarding living as a Jew in Iran, Iraq, Egypt or any other middle-eastern country to contribute.</p>
<p>My first step was to contact a grandson of the aforementioned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_N._Neuberger" target="_blank">Rabbi Herman Neuberger</a>.</p>
<p>Eli Neuberger relayed the following history of Iranian Jewry that is related to his grandfather&#8217;s involvement. (I have edited his comments for brevity, grammar and overall fluidity.)</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The traditional Iranian Jewish schools were run by an umbrella organization called Otzar HaTorah.In the mid 70&#8217;s the Shah and his government decided to nationalise all religious schools, Jewish and Islam alike in order to curb the radical influence that was gaining traction amongst the Muslims. My Grandfather was approached by a Mr. Sasson from London, to travel to Iran to negotiate with the Government in order to minimize secular influence on religious studies.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>While in Iran, my Grandfather visited the community in Shiraz. He thought that if a group of promising Iranians would come to learn at the </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivas_Ner_Yisroel" target="_blank"><em>Ner Israel Rabbinical College</em></a><em> (NIRC), where he was the Dean. Then they could return to Iran and become the Klei Kodesh (spiritual leaders) that could lead the community.The first group arrived in 1977.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>Meanwhile in 1979 the Shah was overthrown by radical Islamists.The students in NIRC could not expect to return home. At the time, many Iranian Jews were able to leave Iran and when they arrived in Austria, Italy etc. they were granted refugee status and were able to continue on to the US.</em></p>
<p><em>The situation became far more dire in 1980 when the Iran-Iraq war started.Boys as young as 12-13 were sent to the front lines to be used as mine sweepers. Many Jews were smuggled to Turkey or Pakistan. These trips were fraught with danger, even after they were able to leave Iran. My grandfather was instrumental in assuring good treatment in Turkey and safe passage to Europe. He made many trips to the corridors of power in DC to speak to Congressman,Senators and Diplomats to be able to insure this continuing clandestine exodus.</em></p>
<p><em>Many of the boys that made the harrowing trip came to study Torah in NIRC.</em></p>
<p><em> </em><em>All this good work was done behind the scenes and with very little fanfare.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>According to the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">n</span>ever accurate Wikipedia, Rabbi Neuberger was instrumental in saving 60,000 Iranian Jews.</p>
<p>I contacted another friend of mine, Natan Davoodi. His family is Iranian (in LA they are called Persian).</p>
<p>He told me that as far as he knows the non-Jews only tolerate the Jews of they can exploited for the benefit of the non-Jew. That doesn&#8217;t sound very good.</p>
<p>I would be remiss if I did not mention Roger Cohen. A NY Times columnist, Cohen has a thing for the Iranians. He thinks all is honky-dory in Iran. He writes about it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/opinion/23cohen.html?scp=7&amp;sq=roger%20cohen&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/opinion/02cohen.html?scp=10&amp;sq=roger%20cohen&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">here</a>. Absolute disgrace.</p>
<p>I would like to hear from you if you know of any injsutice to Jewish people in middle-eastern countries (outside of Israel). Just telling those stories will get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>We are all brothers and sisters and there is no excuse for ignoring their plight.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>the NY Times has a section in their online newspaper called &#8220;The Lede&#8221;. It is often chock full of interesting links and thought on the news of the times. I have been inspired to post links to The Lede before in my blog post about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/09/seen-on-a-bus-ad-in-london-theres-probably-no-god-and-humanists/" target="_blank">&#8220;Bus Ads in London proclaiming there is no GD&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Today, The Lede has a tremendously <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/setbacks-for-women-in-israel-pakistan-and-afghanistan/" target="_blank">misleading post about women&#8217;s rights</a>. Women have been fighting for equality of rights in America for years. Their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage#United_States" target="_blank">right to vote</a> was only recently (relatively) added to the Bill of Rights. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964" target="_blank">Title VII</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX" target="_blank">Title IX</a> are recent acts of legislature to attempt to enforce equality for women.</p>
<p>It is not as if the United States has ALWAYS treated women equally. But now that we do treat women equally in America we are permitted to look down upon anyone who does not (sarcasm emphasized).<span id="more-430"></span>It is so short sighted to act as if women have been equal to men in the United States forever. It also, somehow, gives rise to the right to point at any other culture which does not share our equality of women. I think it is deplorable that any culture not give women access to all rights that exist for men.</p>
<p>Many people point to Judaism as a culture which looks down upon women. In fact one of the egregious acts which The Lede cited was a Jewish newspaper <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iOyfJZGMrNGKq_zb4C5G_7edTo4gD97AT0NO1" target="_blank">using Photoshop to remove 2 women</a> from a photo of Knesset members. The press has portrayed this as some sort of protest against women in government. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>The newspaper is distributed exclusively in the very religious neighborhoods where men do not look at women who are not their immediate family. Never. This is not a matter of rights, it is a matter of being careful with their sexuality. These people are holy people. These people do not want to have thought of women racing through their minds. These people want to maintain a purity which can only be achieved by removing all distractions from their lives. It is to admired and yet, it is not a lifestyle for most of us. They do not ask that we behave this way, they do not punish those who think differently, they merely feel that looking at women could be bad for their souls.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t think this is the right way to observe Judaism. I do not approve of this way of life. I explain it only to demonstrate that these are peace loving people who try to keep to themselves and do not wish to look at women.</p>
<p>I have a different way of approaching women in Judaism and I will be talking and writing about it in the coming weeks. One who looks into the stories of the Torah and Talmud sees women as being above men. Men are constantly deferring to women in the Torah, as we shall learn together.</p>
<p>The Lede feels that this is somehow newsworthy to the point that it is in the same article as flogging women and homosexuals in Pakistan and a severe curtailing of rights in Afghanistan. That is preposterous. No one is hurt by men wishing not to see women. Women have the same rights as men. It is not out of chauvanism or disrespect that holy men refrain from looking at women. Yet, it somehow reaches the same level of audacity as flogging women and homosexuals!!!</p>
<p>Shame on The Lede for this article. It really bothers me. And yet, I disagree with the mentality of those very religious Jews &#8211; but I respect their culture. The NY Times does not.</p>

<p>Those who know me personally will attest that I am not a card carrying member of the &#8220;Woe is us, anti-anti-semitism&#8221; club. However, I did recently <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/10/jew-kipedia-and-tolerance/" target="_blank">blog</a> about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/11/political-discrimination/" target="_blank">tolerance</a> and therefore this video clip is relevant. I do not endorse any comments made by the person who posted this video on You Tube. The only reason I am posting this video is to illustrate that Hate exists. Hate is ugly and Hate needs to stop.</p>
<p>I make these comments to address those who may hate me or us from outside of Judaism and equally to my Jewish brethren. <span id="more-332"></span>We have enough people who hate us, we can&#8217;t afford any discord amongst ourselves. We have too much in common to focus on the differences. When you watch this video I think you should consider if there is too much hate in your life. If there is too much hate &#8211; you gotta get rid of it.</p>
<p>Try this mantra: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be a hater&#8221;.</p>
<p>It may help&#8230;</p>
<p>Video is below.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='980' height='582' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/QBF-1uc-SYc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>This is in America, in Chicago. What do you think is going on in Europe and the Middle East?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I was checking out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> and I was browsing the &#8220;Main Page&#8221;. You can always find an article by searching Wikipedia but you can also browse interesting tidbits on Main Page. Sections like &#8220;On this day&#8221; and &#8220;Did you know&#8221; display linked Wikipedia articles for your enjoyment. This page changes frequently, at least several times per day.</p>
<p>At the precise moment that I was looking at the page I saw this:</p>
<p><span id="more-326"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-325 alignleft" title="Wikipedia | Did You Know?" src="http://i2.wp.com/rabbifink.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/wikipedia-clip.gif?resize=405%2C392" alt="Wikipedia | Did You Know?" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>As you can see, there are 8 bullet points. Three of the eight articles directly relate to something Jewish. That is a very high percentage (38%).</p>
<p>The Jewish population is estimated at around 13 million. The world population is at around 6.8 billion. Some quick math puts the Jewish world population at just under .2%.</p>
<p>The sampling of those Wikipedia articles is way disproportionate to the number of Jewish people in the world. Maybe we should just call it Jew-kipedia.</p>
<p>It is not surprising though. There have been 180 Jewish Nobel Prize winners (that&#8217;s a lot) and we have been around for a long time. The impact the Jewish people have had on the world has been the topic of many books. Perhaps the best of those books is &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/History-Jews-Paul-Johnson/dp/0060915331" target="_blank">A History of the Jews</a>&#8221; by Paul Johnson who is a scholar on Christianity.</p>
<p>What is somewhat troublesome however is the still rampant anti-semitism that exists. The Jewish population is so small yet still garners hatred and disdain from so many. It&#8217;s 2009 people, time to move on! <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3669706,00.html" target="_blank">This article</a> is particularly troubling. 31% of Euros think that the Jewish people are responsible for the economic crisis! How is that even possible? Where do they come up with this stuff?</p>
<p>If you need more and you&#8217;re a glutton for punishment, then read <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123180033807075069.html" target="_blank">this article</a>.</p>
<p>Really, all you need to do is a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=jew&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank">google search</a> for &#8220;Jew&#8221;.</p>
<p>Our world has progressed so much and yet we remain so backwards in so many ways. One word that needs to be taught and emphasized over and over again is tolerance.</p>
<p>Within the Jewish community we are just as guilty of this. We need to be tolerant of each other and our various customs as well. We have to find the common ground between us. Harmony and love will bring our world to a better place. Divisiveness and scorn certainly won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Say it: Tolerance, tolerance, tolerance.</p>
<p>Now do it: Tolerate, tolerate, tolerate.</p>
