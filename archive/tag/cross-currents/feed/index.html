				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Limmud is a pluralistic Jewish organization that organizes learning conferences for Jewish people all over the world. Limmud London is a very large gathering and for the first time ever, it is being attended by the new Chief Rabbi of England, Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis. This has set off a controversy. Many charedi rabbis have prohibited their constituents from attending Limmud and are urging Rabbi Mirvis to renege on his commitment to attend. Â A very important discussion within the Orthodox Jewish community has ensued.<span id="more-7860"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/limmud.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7862" alt="limmud" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/limmud.png?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Rabbi Nathan Lopes Cardozo defends the position of the Chief Rabbi in the Jerusalem Post. His argument is mostly that Limmud is a tremendous opportunity to showcase the beauty of Orthodox Judaism to the world and instead of taking that opportunity, they have handed it off to non-Orthodox Jews. Jonathan Rosenblum defends the charedi position in an article on Cross-Currents. His argument can be summarized as a reaffirmation that attending events with non-Orthodox Jews is the wrong forum for teaching Torah. He bases this on two assumptions. One is that Limmud is not serious about learning because they have too many fluffy sessions like &#8220;50 Shades of Hummus&#8221; and a drumming workshop. The second assumption is that something bad will happen if Orthodox rabbis attend a pluralistic event. He does not mention this in his article, but it is the underlying assumption here. Without making this assumption, his argument about the forum not be serious enough is flailing in a soft breeze.</p>
<p>Rabbi Adlerstein adeptly attacks this assumption in his latest article on Cross-Currents.</p>
<p>The assumption is not necessarily based on facts, evidence, or reason. It is based on a rabbinic proclamation issued 58 years ago and signed by Hall of Fame Orthodox rabbis from the bridge generation between Europe and America. This proclamation declared that it was prohibited by the Law of the Torah to be a member of an organization of Orthodox and non-Orthodox rabbis. In turn, this edict has been interpreted and expanded by the Orthodox Jewish establishment to include any joint learning or activity that may seem to give tacit approval to non-Orthodox movements.</p>
<p>As only he can, Rabbi Adlerstein softly and respectfully suggests that perhaps it is time to revisit this assumption. He makes two arguments. First, the reason for the proclamation in 5716 was to address Jews on the fence between Orthodox and non-Orthoodox Judaism. In his opinion, this is no longer a valid concern.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/17/we-are-going-in-the-wrong-direction/" target="_blank">I agree</a>. In fact, there is no more fence. Now we have a Grand Canyons between us. The soft center is nearly gone. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/07/09/my-appearance-with-rabbi-shafran-on-talkline-with-zev-brenner/" target="_blank">Rabbi Sacks lamented this in his controversial farewell address</a>. It&#8217;s true. So there is hardly a concern that we are going to lose the soft middle to non-Orthodox movements if we acknowledge they exist.</p>
<p>Second, Rabbi Adlerstein seems to be saying that working together need not imply approval, tacit or otherwise. We are absolutely capable of engaging in a discussion while acknowledging our irreconcilable differences. We do it all the time in real life. We don&#8217;t only talk to people with whom we agree on everything. Somehow it works.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/17/we-are-going-in-the-wrong-direction/" target="_blank">I agree with this as well</a>. Rabbi Shubert Spero made this argument in the 1960&#8217;s. He was correct back then and Rabbi Adlerstein is correct today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that we can be a little more forceful that Rabbi Adlerstein. We actually have a responsibility to our shrinking non-Orthodox brethren to shine bright the light of passionate, compassionate, enlightening and enlightened Judaism. Non-Orthodox Judaism has kept many of our brothers and sisters in the fold. They are Jewish and religious in their own way thanks to Reform, Conservative, and the rest of them. For that we sincerely thank them. But many yearn for more. Not everyone that yearns for more will become Orthodox. Many of them would never attend a lecture that has Kiruv written all over it. But they will attend Limmud. They will attend other pluralistic events. That is our opportunity to inspire them.</p>
<p>There is no cost anymore. There is nothing to fear from showcasing our version of Judaism to more people, even if there is a drum circle 25 yards away. Nothing bad is going to happen. They are not the enemy. Our mutual enemy is leaving Judaism, God, and religion entirely. We are actually partners in that war. Let&#8217;s fight together.</p>
<p>The only reason we think something bad might happen is because we have a rabbinic edict telling us so.</p>
<p>But the truth is that the edict itself never prohibited a rabbi from speaking at Limmud or at a similar event. It merely prohibited membership to pluralistic organizations. We don&#8217;t need to violate the edict in order to participate! Why make the letter more broad than its words? It is shooting ourselves in the foot for no good reason. One can stay loyal to the Gedolim who signed the proclamation and speak at Limmud. They are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>We can debate the value of the rabbinic edict with regard to membership another time. Limmud is not membership. It is a speaking engagement. An amazing opportunity that I can only hope will inspire more rabbis to participate in a similar way in the future. We can pave the way for a time where all Jewish people can learn from one another. Yes, there are even some things that Orthodox Jews can learn from non-Orthodox Jews, despite Jonathan Rosenblum&#8217;s insistence to the contrary.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of unity. We can do great things together if we take a break from chasing demons from the last century.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are quite a few approaches that religious people take in their attitude toward atheists and atheism. Three different ideas have been pitched or implemented in various outlets over the last couple of weeks. Seeing as so many of my fellow Jews are atheists, closeted or otherwise, I think it&#8217;s a question that contemporary Judaism must address.<span id="more-7721"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7722" alt="photo" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/photo.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>A billboard in New York&#8217;s Times Square proclaims: <em>&#8220;To all of our atheist friends: Thank God youâre wrong.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cute line. It&#8217;s not very substantive and I see no chance of winning any atheists over with this kind of advertisement. It&#8217;s cool that God is getting a shout-out in Times Square. It&#8217;s definitely a lone voice among a very vocal majority of very unGodly advertisements and signage in that spot. But that&#8217;s the only value I can see in it.</p>
<p>The New York Times contrasted this billboard with a recent statement by the Pope: <em>âGiven â and this is the fundamental thing â that Godâs mercy has no limits, if He is approached with a sincere and repentant heart the question for those who do not believe in God is to abide by their own conscience. There is sin, also for those who have no faith, in going against oneâs conscience. Listening to it and abiding by it means making up oneâs mind about what is good and evil.â</em></p>
<p>In other words, I think the Pope is saying that actions are far more important than faith. This is particularly ironic coming from Catholicism which has traditionally placed such a great emphasis on belief. In fact, part of the Orthodox Jewish meme on Christianity is that they are all about faith while we are about action. (I&#8217;m not saying this is true. I am saying that this is taught.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a much more inclusive message than the billboard&#8217;s message. I think the Pope&#8217;s message will have a greater influence on positive social behavior than a snarky anti-atheist sign. It also increases the chances that a non-believer would care to be involved in religion. The Pope wins this one.</p>
<p>Rabbi Avi Shafran also proposed some billboards to promote Orthodox Judaism. His ideas: <em>What if, instead of special offers and glitzy offerings, we simply proclaimed loud and clear â in billboards and web ads and social media â that being a Jew, like it or not, precious fellow Jew, means being Divinely charged, that it means shouldering, whether it is always comfortable or not, responsibility ? And that ignoring that mandate is a reckless wasting of an opportunity to live a meaningful life by doing G-dâs will? That each of us has a stark and urgent choice: either to regard our lives as the brief opportunities to access eternity they are, or to waste oneâs days in the pursuit of stuff and fun and ârightsâ?</em></p>
<p>I think this sounds more like the Times Square billboards than the Pope. While advertising our message is a great idea, I fear that advertising a hard line message is not going to win too many people over. I think that the approach largely depends on one&#8217;s goal. For some, the goal is that people join your movement. That&#8217;s a good goal if your movement is a good one. It also depends on whether people are amenable to your movements rules and regulations.</p>
<p>But Orthodox Judaism is not for everyone. It can be. But right now it is not. So perhaps we would be better off with a goal echoed by the Pope. We should be promoting positive, universal values that will help improve the world. Help people who might need a boost find something in their Judaism or other religious heritage that can help them in their lives.</p>
<p>There is so much that religion can offer people, even if they are not believers. Giving them those opportunities trumps snarky billboards and heavy handed pressure, in my opinion. Yes, we need to get the message out there. The question is what is that message.</p>
<p>I think the message is that religion and in particular Judaism can be beneficial to people no matter what they believe.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most important discussion in orthodox Judaism right now is the pair of articles written by R&#8217; Zev Farber. The articles have been deemed heresy by R&#8217; Gordimer on Cross-Currents. If you are averse to reading anything that might touch on issues and ideas that are possibly heretical please stop reading and pick up a Nesivos Shalom or something.</p>
<p>Still here? Okay. The two articles say different things so I&#8217;d like to briefly address the <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2013/07/18/from-openness-to-heresy/" target="_blank">Cross-Currents post</a> as it relates to the &#8220;<a href="http://thetorah.com/devarim-recounting-different/" target="_blank">short article.</a>&#8221; This article went through two versions. R&#8217; Gordimer&#8217;s article used the first version which was more objectionable. R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s article was edited a full week before the article on Cross-Currents was published. I find this to be egregious. If you are going to call someone a heretic, possibly the worst thing to call an orthodox Jew, you best be sure that every detail of your case is accurate.<span id="more-7405"></span></p>
<p>The original version said this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The simplest explanation for these differences between the accounts in Exodus-Numbers and Deuteronomy is that they were penned by (at least) two different authors with different conceptions of the desert experience.</em></p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Despite sharing many details with the desert story as told in Exodus and Numbers, there is no way to make the two versions work with each other without unreasonably stretching the meaning of the texts. Whether it be the description of the scout story, the reaction of the Edomites and Moabites to Israelâs request, or the legitimacy of dwelling in the Transjordan, the two versions work with contradictory assumptions.</em></p>
<p>I can see why R&#8217; Gordimer thinks this is heresy. I don&#8217;t think it has to be as will be discussed later. But the second version is almost certainly not heresy. This is the revised version:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Despite sharing many details with the desert story as told in Exodus and Numbers, there appears to be no way to make the two versions work with each other without unreasonably stretching the meaning of the texts. The simplest literary approach is the academic one which posits multiple authors with multiple traditions. How such an approach meshes with traditionalist belief requires serious thought but it is necessary to start by recognizing the simplicity and straightforwardness of the academic approach.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7406" alt="Bible1" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Bible1.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>There is nothing remarkable about this statement. It simply states that the academic approach is simpler. Simpler is not necessarily more truthful. Thus, there is no value judgment on whether the academic approach is preferable. I hope that if this was the only thing R&#8217; Farber said, it would not have created a controversy. I hope. For this reason, I am disappointed in the Cross-Currents article.</p>
<p>However, whenever I raise this point I am reminded of the other &#8220;<a href="http://thetorah.com/torah-history-judaism-introduction/" target="_blank">long article</a>&#8221; where the heresy is stronger and harder to wiggle out of.</p>
<p>On to the second article.</p>
<p>This is R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s worldview. It is his Grand Theory of Everything. His goal is clear. R&#8217; Farber wants very badly to harmonize all the things he has taken for granted as an orthodox Jew, his adherence to halacha and social orthodoxy, with modern Biblical Criticism. This is his goal and it is important to begin with an appreciation of his assumptions.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Farber takes the challenges presented by Bible critics very seriously. It&#8217;s hard not to take them seriously. They are asking good questions. It&#8217;s true that we have &#8220;frum&#8221; answers for most of these questions and some of the questions are not so bothersome. Yet, the challenges exist.</p>
<p>The maximalist Bible critic answer is the text is not Divine. It is a text that comes from people and therefore any anomaly is understood as poor editing by a later redactor. The various writers have different agendas and their works reflect their personal biases.</p>
<p>The maximalist orthodox Jewish answer is that the text is Divine. It is a text that comes from God and therefore any anomaly is understood as part of the infinite wisdom of the Author of the Torah. The different versions of stories and laws reflect Divine intent to teach us everything we need to know.</p>
<p>There is a huge chasm between these two approaches. They share nothing other than the questions that they ask.</p>
<p>But most thinking people know that the maximalist orthodox Jewish position is untenable. No one really thinks that. The people who do are &#8220;mesorah maximalists&#8221; who will hide from the truth to support their position. The Talmud discusses the last few verses of Devarim. Chazal had a different midpoint to their Torah scrolls. Ezra reconciled the texts of several versions of Torah scrolls. Maimonides reconciled errors he found in Torah scrolls using the Aleppo Codex. Rashi had at least one discrepancy in his Torah scroll. Ibn Ezra famously said that there are twelve places in the Chumash that speak in present tense and those were not written by Moses.</p>
<p>In other words, we know that some parts of the Chumash were not spoken by God to Moses. That&#8217;s certainly acceptable in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>We also know that there is a dispute about the very nature of the book of Devarim. The Ramban says it was given word for word from God to Moses at Sinai. Others say Moses spoke these words as prophecy. Contrasted with the rest of the Chumash, it is more similar to the books of the prophets than Sefer Vayikra in this respect. The Avnei Nezer says that Devarim is a bridge between the Written Law and the Oral Law as it is Moshe&#8217;s discourse where he darshens the first four books of the Chumash.</p>
<p>The point is obvious. Devarim is treated differently by the Medieval commentators. The maximalist orthodox Jewish answer is not a reasonable position. Legitimate sources recognize this and we must recognize this as well. The question I wish to address is why. Why do we find these sort of opinions about Devarim and other scattered examples throughout the Chumash?</p>
<p>There are two possible answers. I think here we find a difference of opinion loosely based on affiliation. Charedim subscribe to one view and non-charedim subscribe to another.</p>
<p>Charedim are more apt to say that God included all aforementioned items when God gave the Torah to Moses. God told Moses to make the book of Devarim sound different. It was part of God&#8217;s plan that errors rf anachronisms creep into the text for the sake of the answers that would be given later. They were latent in the text the entire time but were waiting for the right people to reveal them.</p>
<p>Non-Charedim are more likely to take a different approach. This alternative approach holds that things may have happened after revelation and great Torah authorities used their wisdom and Torah knowledge to answer the questions in the best way they know how. This means that the issues that forced the hand of the great sages were the result of history, scribal errors, or any other circumstance that could have caused the problems. The answers are true to Torah because of the people who said them and their universal acceptance by the greater Jewish people.</p>
<p>We could say the same thing about the drashos we find in Chazal whether they be Halachic or Aggadic. One way of looking at it is that these drashos were latent in the text, they were always there, they were always kept, they were just &#8220;revealed&#8221; by the various tanaim and amoraim. The other view is that these drashos were Chazal&#8217;s way of dealing with textual and perhaps social or religious issues. They could have learned differently, but they chose to learn this way. The drashos that gained consensus became Torah. This approach certainly rings true when studying the Talmud.</p>
<p>Why did one opinion in the Talmud say that the last verses in Devarim were not written by Moses? Because he had a mesorah? Or was it simply the easiest solution to a very obvious problem? I think it is more elegent to say that he saw a problem and this was his solution. To say otherwise means that at some point the mesorah was lost and a disagreement developed and the rabbis were merely reporters of their tradition as opposed to Torah giants with ideas of their own.</p>
<p>It is possible that the version I ascribe to more charedi orthodox Jews is correct. But I don&#8217;t think it is correct. It&#8217;s hard to believe that Chazal came along and just explained what was already known to everyone. But even if the charedi version is correct with regard to Chazal, it is almost certainly not correct with regard to the rishonim.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard people say that Rashi on Chumash is a semi-prophetic work. Rashi was Divinely inspired to comment on each verse and his commentary reflects God&#8217;s intended interpretation of the verses. This is a disservice to Rashi. It seems to me that Rashi saw inconsistencies or anomolies in the text and he chose his preferred interpretations from his vast knowledge of Chazal&#8217;s teachings. Rashi saw a problem and Rashi provided the solution.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s easier to see where this is taking us by looking at Ibn Ezra and Rambam. Why did the Ibn Ezra say that there are 7 places in the Chumash that are not original to the text? Was it something handed down to him from his teachers? I don&#8217;t think so. I am fairly certain that Ibn Ezra saw a problem in the text, there was evidence that contravened the accepted (or maybe it wasn&#8217;t accepted at that time) wisdom that every word of the Torah was given to Moses by God and those were the exact same words they had in the 11th century Torah scrolls. His solution was to accept the evidence and change the dogma. Religion cannot contradict truth so Ibn Ezra adjusted the religion accordingly.</p>
<p>Rambam managed to make the Torah consistent with Greek and Arabic philosophy. Do we think that Rambam thought that Greek and Arabic philosophy were handed to Moses from God at Sinai? That&#8217;s preposterous. Rather, Rambam held that the maxims he accepted in those non-Jewish sources were the truth. If they are true, then the Torah must work with Greek and Arabic philosophy. Rambam made it work. It&#8217;s the same idea. Rambam accepted external evidence and then conformed the Torah to make sense in the context of his truth. Truth cannot be changed. But sometimes religious dogma can be changed. Even more surprising is that Rambam did not say &#8220;prove Greek and Arabic philosophy to me and then I will work out the Torah but until then I accept the Torah as truth and all this secular stuff is obviously wrong.&#8221; He simply accepted the secular wisdom as true and conformed Torah to that truth.</p>
<p>This is how the rishonim and Chazal dealt with Torah vs. evidence.</p>
<p>Similarly, when both Chazal and rishonim encountered a verse or section that seemed too unlikely to be literal, they interpreted it metaphorically. We don&#8217;t circumcise our hearts because that verse was deemed allegorical. Rishonim, like Ralbag and Rambam went even further by turning sections that contradicted their common sense into dream-sequences or metaphors. Many rishonim and even some achronim have done the same thing with difficult passages in the Talmud. If it can&#8217;t be explained literally because of evidence then it could be allegorized. (Granted, some achronim felt no pangs of guilt by simply saying that Chazal were incorrect.)</p>
<p>The point to all this is to demonstrate how things have changed. The achronim lived in a time where science and other evidence was used to counter religion, not bolster it. In turn, they began the trend of lifting religion above the fray and arguing that the science or other evidence must be reinterpreted to fit religion. If it could not reinterpreted, it was wrong. This is the paradigm of almost all religions since the Renaissance and Enlightenment. There were exceptions to this rule, but for the most part this rule has held firm for several hundred years. Evolution doesn&#8217;t seem to fit in with Biblical narratives? Despite much more evidence than there is for the erroneous astronomy Rambam used in the Mishneh Torah, religious people all over the world are fighting against evolution. The Bible seems to be a composite work? Religious people reply that it&#8217;s impossible. Chazal seemed to be mistaken about medicine or science or math? Our modern thinking must be wrong, or alternatively the Talmud meant something else, or alternatively nature has changed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s such a different attitude from the way Torah scholars approached evidence for almost 2000 years.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t learn Chumash the same way the rishonim learned Chumash. Instead we learn what the rishonim said about the Chumash. This handicaps us from being too innovative on the one hand and has a way of maintaining tradition on the other hand.</p>
<p>I believe, what R&#8217; Farber is trying to do is to relaunch the ancient way of studying Chumash. How would Chazal or some of the rishonim reacted to the evidence presented by Biblical Criticism? If they were consistent, I believe they would have done something like R&#8217; Farber has done in his long article. I am not commenting on R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s academically leaning conclusions. There are other conclusions that could be reached by the questions raised. But his version is certainly a valid conclusion, especially when one only takes the academic data and for the sake of argument ignores the religious approach.</p>
<p>In his long article R&#8217; Farber allegorizes some things. Other things are seen as products of editing over time. We have seen that allegorization is an acceptable form of interpretation. We have also seen that it was obvious that to Chazal and rishonim that the text of the Torah had been edited. R&#8217; Gordimer and others take issue with both of these devices.</p>
<p>Allegorizing too much of the text could create a problem for people. It might be seen as cannibalizing the Torah. If the narratives are not literal then are they meaningful? R&#8217; Farber says yes. Others seem to say no. I don&#8217;t see a reason to say no. I only see a fear of what might happen if we say no. R&#8217; Farber is trying to lay the groundwork for allegorization not to be a problem.</p>
<p>As to the issue of subsequent editing of the Torah I don&#8217;t see how it&#8217;s a huge problem. R&#8217; Farber is not saying that random people came around and edited the Torah. I think R&#8217; Farber is saying that the edits were made by prophets. The same way we take the works of the prophets seriously and we take them as divine books, we can take edits to the Bible. Our Tanach is filled with various voices that sound very different. Sometimes these books contradict one another. But it&#8217;s okay because we know that they all came from God and God speaks through each prophet in a different way. If prophets did the same thing to the Torah, it&#8217;s true that this would be a very different way of looking at Torah, but in the end, it&#8217;s just as binding on us. It&#8217;s equally the word of God. <a href="http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6372&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=90" target="_blank">There is a rishon</a> who says something like this with regard to the stories in the Torah.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s approach completely changes what we mean by Torah M&#8217;Sinai as well. But is the belief in our version of Torah M&#8217;Sinai a necessary belief for orthodox Judaism to work? Perhaps not.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s worldview is the articulation of how Revelation and Torah M&#8217;Sinai works. Professor Tamar Ross makes an attempt at this, and I don&#8217;t think it satisfactory (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/12/torah-msinai-according-to-professor-tamar-ross/">Torah MâSinai According to Professor Tamar Ross</a> ) R&#8217; Farber articulates his beliefs at the end of the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe in Torah Min Ha-Shamayim, that the Torah is from heaven, and that the entirety of the book is nevua (prophecy) and represents the encounter between God and the people of Israel.</li>
<li>I believe in Torah mi-Sinai, meaning the uniqueness of the Torah as being of a higher order than any other work in its level of divine encounter. The story of the revelation at Sinai in the Torah I understand as a narrative depiction of a deeper truthâthe Torah is Godâs book and the divine blueprint for Israel and Jewish life.</li>
<li>I believe that the Torah is meant to be as it is today and that all of its verses, from âTimnah was a concubineâ (Gen. 36:12) to âI am the Lord your God,â are holy.</li>
<li>I believe that halakha and Jewish theology must develop organically from Torah interpretation and not by excising or ignoring any part of the Torah or Chazalâs interpretation.</li>
</ul>
<p>They sound pretty safe and pretty reasonable. But I also think that this kind of Torah M&#8217;Sinai is too nuanced to catch on and it sounds too heretical to gain traction.</p>
<p>It seems to me that R&#8217; Farber is trying to use orthodox principles to push orthodox Judaism into a discussion about our sacred texts.</p>
<p>If this is what R&#8217; Farber is doing, and I am pretty sure it is, we can say that he has good intentions. We can also say that it deserves a conversation and not to be shot down as heretical immediately. I was particularly upset that the article on Cross-Currents did not articulate the objections to R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s statements. Instead quotes were mined and the audience was expected to simply conclude that the statements were heretical. It is symptomatic of a larger problem in orthodox Judaism where reason and debate are stifled. Dogmatic proclamations are very much in style. Well argued responsa died with R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein.</p>
<p>Purely for the sake of honest religious debate, I think that R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s approach demands a discussion and not condemnation. But for the social reasons I think there is even more benefit to an inclusive approach. We should not be rooting for a breakaway from orthodoxy by the Left, nor should we even give the appearance of rooting for it. One thing that Yeshiva Chovevei Torah and its community do well, is inclusivity. The times we live in are dark in some ways, but people are more capable than ever before to think on their own and formulate their judgments. I see no benefit to jettisoning an entire group of people and the people who are sympathetic to them because of controversial statements. I am aware that this is a time-honored custom of Jews and religious people everywhere. I just don&#8217;t see the utility in it anymore. Our best defense against losing the battle vs. complete secularism is not insularity and narrowing the playing field. Our best defense is the exact opposite.</p>
<p>If we want to have a small narrow-minded cult that ignores the outside world and in turn is ignored by the outisde world we should continue the trend of ousting people and movements from orthodox Judaism. If we want to keep a foothold in the outside world and carry weight and influence in a world that could certainly use some of our wisdom, we need to keep the broadest base possible.</p>
<p>I hope that R&#8217; Farber&#8217;s article and the entire theTorah.com website can become a springboard for education and discussion. Inclusivity to the maximum should be our goal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Capture.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6189" title="Capture" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Capture.jpg?resize=300%2C214" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>By now you&#8217;ve heard that the American Academy of Pediatrics has published their recent findings on circumcision. Until now, the medical benefits of circumcision were questioned and science did not have an &#8220;opinion&#8221; on the matter. Now, the AAP has found that there are some benefits to circumcision.</p>
<p>Of course, this is being touted as a major victory for Jews and Muslims who circumcise their children and a spear in the eye of the Intactivists here in American and abroad on Europe. I have seen articles on Commentary and Cross-Currents to that effect.</p>
<p>I think there are three slightly sobering points that are important to make in light of this discovery and the cheers from circumcision advocates drunk with joy over this report.</p>
<p><span id="more-6188"></span></p>
<p>First, we don&#8217;t circumcise because of the medical benefits of circumcision. I daresay that even if circumcision were deemed medically harmful we would still circumcise. More importantly, there is no tenet of our belief that requires circumcision be medically beneficial. We believe it is spiritually beneficial. No science can prove or disprove that.</p>
<p>Second, the study simply does not state that they are many benefits to circumcision or that the benefits affect many people. In fact, the benefit described is that circumcised men are less likely to contract AIDS in third world countries. Orthodox Judaism already has a great way of preventing AIDS, it&#8217;s called fidelity. That is aside from the fact that we are living in modern countries and not third world countries. This &#8220;benefit&#8221; hardly benefits the religious community. I mean, are we seriously going to start teaching our kids that Bris Milah is a great way of preventing AIDS? Further, the medical data is subject to change. We can&#8217;t rely on science to save circumcision.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: When is this medical benefit realized? When one becomes sexually active and the partner has HIV. Is this really something we are concerned with? Further, the objection of the Intactivist is not that circumcision should be banned. It is that children should not be circumcised when they are babies. If one wishes to have the procedure done to minimally guard against AIDS then have the procedure done before becoming sexually active. There is no compelling reason to do it when the child is a baby. The medical benefit does not bolster the argument that we should circumcise at birth. Not at all.</p>
<p>Finally, the argument against circumcision that is being made by Intactivists is unaffected by this study. The reason they oppose circumcision is not because it is inherently harmful, rather it is because the choice is not being made by the person affected by the decision. Would we condone a parent tattooing their child? Obviously not. This is despite the fact that tattoos are not harmful to the child. Intactivists oppose circumcision for the same reason. A child should have the right to decide if they want to be circumcised. It is not the parents&#8217; decision to make. The point is that it makes no difference whether there is a medical benefit, as specious or as generous as the benefit might be, the objection to circumcision is that the parent is making a decision for the child that the child should make on their own.</p>
<p>Creating strawman Intactivists and knocking them down may be great fun and make us feel good about ourselves. But in the end, we need to understand the challenge of the Intactivists and make good, solid arguments in defense of circumcision.</p>
<p>I have argued that the aforementioned objection does not apply to orthodox Jews or Muslims in a previous post. I maintain that this is the best argument against Intactivists and relying on new scientific data is not our best argument. Read that post here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/22/circumcision-follow-up-or-why-circumcision-is-not-barbaric-for-orthodox-jews/">Circumcision Follow Up (or why circumcision is not barbaric for Orthodox Jews)</a>. Read it again. It&#8217;s still as relevant as it was then.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/stop-sign.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4988" title="stop-sign" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/stop-sign-300x193.jpg?resize=300%2C193" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Thugs and hoodlums from extremist religious groups in Israel have been terrorizing fellow Jews for some time now. They have done so without fear of condemnation or retribution from the religiously adjacent charedi community. This recent wave of violence is not new nor is it shocking or surprising.</p>
<p>Spitting on young girls, calling women whores, forcing segregation at bus stops and on buses are all acts cut from the same cloth as the violence at Manny&#8217;s Bookshop and a political beating in Meah Shearim. We&#8217;ve known about this for a while. Nobody has said a word.</p>
<p>However, this time the media found out about it. So now it&#8217;s national and international news.</p>
<p>This has prompted responses and condemnations from rabbis, rabbinic authorities and lay people. That&#8217;s great. Finally.Â The problem is that these condemnations are so weak, hedged and long-winded that they, in my opinion, are a failure.</p>
<p>There is only one way to condemn violence and abuse towards women. That would be something like this:<span id="more-4987"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>We strongly condemn any and all violence towards women under any and all circumstances. Those who commit such acts of violence will feel the full effect and power of the religious and secular court system. They will be excommunicated from all religious circles and are heretofore to be considered persona non grata. If you know of any individuals who have abused anyone, whether verbally or physically notify the police and rabbinic leadership immediately.</strong></p>
<p>What we don&#8217;t need is an explanation of how these people are not &#8220;real charedim&#8221;. We don&#8217;t need poetry on the majesty of tznius. We don&#8217;t need snide remarks about the secular media. Just speak out against violence, promise retribution and to take action.</p>
<p>Enough with the apologetics and handwringing.</p>
<p><em>Feel free to copy and paste my version of an appropriate condemnation on all the blogs and news sites that have published the watered down condemnations to this point. If you can, please credit this blog. Thanks.</em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>On Cross-Currents, Rabbi Adlerstein recommends a recent article written by Dr. Moshe Koppel.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.azure.org.il/index.php"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4957" title="3613078627_5f8765aac9" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/3613078627_5f8765aac9.jpg?resize=201%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>On Cross-Currents, Rabbi Adlerstein recommends a recent article written by Dr. Moshe Koppel. Seeing as Rabbi Adlerstein rarely makes recommendations, I decided to see what the fuss was about.</p>
<p>The article is a 36 page masterpiece. Honestly, I think it is the best article I have ever read and I read a lot of articles, especially on Judaism.</p>
<p>Dr. Koppel proposes an elegant theory of how Judaism changes, Jewish law evolves and how that relates to many of our social issues today. He touches on insularity, the one-upmanship of piling stringencies upon stringencies, the necessity of belief and many other topics in this far ranging article.</p>
<p>I found myself agreeing with most of Dr. Koppel&#8217;s arguments and assertions. He builds a grand edifice from which the article could have made many different points. I found the final point that Dr. Koppel actually made in the article less compelling than the edifice from which the point was made. But I think there are several issues that I do find compelling that can be analyzed effectively using the tools provided in the article.<span id="more-4956"></span></p>
<p>Here are three very poignant items from the article that I think demonstrate the breadth and beauty of the article.</p>
<p>On the various versions of core beliefs that have developed over time for different segments of orthodox Judaism:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>While for some, it may be enough to believe that Judaism has evolved helter-skelter from some special origins in the murky past, others might need to feel certain that every detail of Judaism such as it is today can be traced directly to an original revelation in a specific place at a specific time. While for some, it may be enough that the process is limping forward in some vaguely understood, positive direction, others might need the ultimate destination of the process to be specified in terms of concrete political events and/or miraculous interventions, and signs of the imminence and inevitability of such events to be already discernible. WhileÂ for some the satisfaction of leading a life bound to Torah is its own reward, others might need to be assured that the righteous reap rewards and the wicked suffer punishments in the most prosaic of ways, preferably instantly and in plain sight.</em></p>
<p>On acts that demonstrate that a person is associating with orthodox Judaism:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The effectiveness of signals can, however, vary with time and circumstance. In the world of American Orthodox Judaism, the refusal to eat non-kosher meat or Hostess Twinkies was once regarded as sufficiently onerous, due to the dearth of alternatives, that it could serve as an effective signal. But then the easy availability of kosher meat and snacks rendered such signals ineffective, because they were insufficiently costly. As a result, the old signals were replaced by new ones that were onerous enough to serve as signals. Kosher was replaced by glatt kosher, which was replaced by hasidishe shechita, yashon, hydroponic vegetables, and so on up the ladder of costliness and strictness. The easier each of these becomes to obtain, the less useful it is.Â </em></p>
<p>On the increased emphasis on the infallibility of the sages and demonization of the non-observant:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The need for the faithful to signal loyalty to ever-narrower splinter groups has led to increas- ing emphasis on precisely those aspects of tradition that are obscure and unnatural, while the lack of opportunity for constructive sacrifice has given rise to socially costly signaling. Like- wise, the need for the faithful to affirm an articulated narrative has become much greater, just as the specificity of the narrative has become more pronounced. Affirming the belief in the genius of the sages, the powers of the righteous, and the inevitable downfall of the wicked has become a litmus test of loyalty. Increasing monasticism and obscurantism have led to in- creasing defection. Each of these reactions has been triggered and exacerbated by the others and together they have constituted a vicious cycle, driving the community further and fur- ther away from a good equilibrium.Â </em></p>
<p>These examples are a mere taste of the amazing insight prevalent in the article.</p>
<p>I selected these sections as they support many of the ideas that I have written about on this blog. Much of our current &#8220;system&#8221; &#8211; if we can even call it that, is a result of social choices, consequences and needs. They are not specicically spiritual or halachic in nature. They evolved parallel to halacha but from a human perspective.</p>
<p>This does not mean that they are insignificant or that they are wrong. But it does mean that they need to be treated differently than halacha.</p>
<p>I think Dr. Koppel&#8217;s theory can be applied wonderfully to women rabbis and other contemporary issues facing orthodox Judaism today. In fact, I thought that is where he was going with the first 30 pages. Then he took a turn into an issue that I am as concerned with. But as I said above, the edifice is a platform for explaining and understanding many issues.</p>
<p>I hope you will take the time to read the article in its entirety and consider its message. It is long, but absolutely worthwhile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #888888;"><em>Originally Posted on YUBeacon.com:Â <a href="http://yubeacon.com/2011/11/features/there-is-no-tent/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #888888;">There is No Tent</span></a></em></span></p>
<p>Lately it seems like everyone is trying to define Modern Orthodoxy. The purpose of these attempts revolves around one specific institution and its graduates, Yeshiva Chovevei Torah (YCT).</p>
<p>Four articles (<a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/09/27/modern-orthodoxy-at-a-crossroads-2/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/11/09/modern-orthodoxy-is-always-at-the-crossroads/" target="_blank">2</a>, <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/11/13/modern-orthodoxy-in-the-crosshairs/" target="_blank">3</a>, <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/11/16/defining-modern-orthodoxyâs-crossroads/" target="_blank">4</a>) on a prominent Centrist-Orthodox blog tried to tackle the YCT issue (see links below). Three of the articles called on Modern Orthodoxy to disaffiliate with YCT. One article explained that YCT deserved to be included in the Modern Orthodox tent. Much ink has been spilled over YCT and the more that is written, the more things stay the same. Platitudes and proclamations have done nothing to stop YCT. Indeed, they serve a need within Orthodox Jewish community. They tend to those who would like to be Orthodox but find some its social constraints too limiting. There is a place for YCT. However, there is no place for the articles calling for its demise.</p>
<p>The articles assume there is an umbrella under which some institutions, rabbis or individuals are permitted to take shelter. The outsiders are subject to excommunication and ridicule. It is a tent where like-minded people share common goals, appreciation and self-congratulation. In their opinion, YCT belongs outside the tent.</p>
<p>A second assumption in the articles is that Modern Orthodox Judaism needs a definition. It must be codified lest it suffer some horrible end. Without a definition it is doomed to be over-inclusive and possibly even under-inclusive. There is talk that YCT is âcounterfeiting Torahâ and that must be ousted from the Modern Orthodox camp.</p>
<p>All this talk of camps, umbrellas, tents and definitions is misplaced. Similarly, limited denominations such as Orthodox, Conservative and Reform are misplaced.<span id="more-4860"></span></p>
<p>Tackling the second assumption first, it seems that Modern Orthodoxy has a complex.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/21/there-is-no-tent/62c094be0fcf82a57120661a19d95b94/" rel="attachment wp-att-9376"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9376" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/62c094be0fcf82a57120661a19d95b94.jpg?w=980" alt="62c094be0fcf82a57120661a19d95b94" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> It needs âdefining.â It is as if Modern Orthodoxy feels that it is a novel form of serving God or an aberration from the classic style of Jewish life. Nothing could be further from the truth. Modern Orthodoxy needs to have the confidence to positively assert that Modern Orthodoxy is not the âkid brotherâ of big-boy Charedi Judaism. It is the Charedi world that is an aberration from almost every Jewish society in recorded history.</p>
<p>Jewish life for over 2500 years has been determined by fealty to God, Torah, and Mitzvos all while living with one firmly planted foot in the general society. Tannaim held typical jobs and conducted conversations with Greek philosophers. Similarly, Amoraim discussed religion with Roman royalty. During the period of the Geonim and Rishonim, Jews had jobs, educated Jews studied the sciences and philosophy of their day and the great Torah scholars were well versed in many disciplines including Torah. Even during the period of the Achronim, many of the most famous interpreters and codifiers of law were proficient in science, mathematics and philosophy.</p>
<p>Where is the societal precedent for todayâs isolationism and shunning of all wisdom outside of Torah? Why does Modern Orthodoxy not proudly assume the mantle of traditional Judaism? Why does it always feel like Modern Orthodoxy needs to be explaining and defining itself?</p>
<p>Modern Orthodox Judaism is a straight shot from the Jewish life that was lived for thousands of years by Torah observant Jews. There is nothing for Modern Orthodox Jews to be ashamed of,Â other than not realizing this important point. Torah observance is primary; there is no doubt about that. Wisdom found outside Torah has always been valued and there is no reason that should be any different today.</p>
<p>As to the first assumption, that of the tent: Judaism is the only necessary denomination. Everything else is just the narcissism of small differences.</p>
<p>Throughout Jewish history, Jews with varying degrees of observance and a variety of beliefs lived side by side. Sometimes they quarreled, oftentimes vociferously, but their disagreements took place in one tent. It was unwise and unfruitful to divide and self define into small groups. More significantly, there was no social benefit to doing so.</p>
<p>In Ashkenaz, for their non-Jewish neighbors, the Jewish people were âthe other.â For the Jewish people, the non-Jewish people were âthe other.â There was no need to drill down into subgroups. There was no social benefit to subgrouping.</p>
<p>When non-Jews ceased to be âthe other,â as Ashkenazic Jews became more integrated into general society, a new âotherâ was created. The more integrated group branded the more isolated group as âOrthodoxâ and the more isolated group branded the more integrated group âReform.â Jews were now âthe otherâ for other Jews.</p>
<p>In truth, this was a tragedy. Judaism is not just a religion. It is a family. We are all united as Jews by common ancestry. We are also united as people who follow the Jewish religion. But one can be a non-religious Jew. This is not so with other religions. By calling one another âthe otherâ we cast aspersion across the religious spectrum. Fights and disagreements ensue. Communication is halted. And this is where we start erecting self-serving tents. There should be only one tent. A tent that is large enough for our entire family, no matter how they observe. Our family should all be able to live under one tent.</p>
<p>This is not a pipe dream. At least three contemporary Jewish communities function in this way. These communities are the South African, Persian/Iranian and the Syrian communities. In these communities there is no segmentation based on Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox. Rather, everyone is part of a larger community and within the larger community some families are more observant than others. Yet, many different levels of observance will be found in one shul or one school</p>
<p>It wasnât too long ago that this was the case in Ashkenazic communities in North America. In the 60âs and 70âs, children from non-observant homes went to school with children from very observant homes. The greater Jewish community was not strong enough to tolerate subgroups and segmentation. Our strength has become a curse. We are now very strong, and we now are willing to exclude fellow Jews from our tent.</p>
<p>These subgroups do not serve a religious purpose. Judaism has always been about performing the mitzvot as prescribed in the Torah. It is a personal relationship between Man and Creator. There is no allegiance that must be paid to human dogmas. People are supposed to study, learn, and forge their own relationship with God.</p>
<p>To this end, what purpose does the tent serve? Who needs a tent and tenets of the tent to tell them what to do and how to act? The Torah, its interpreters and codifiers have given us all that we need. The tent only serves one purpose: to exclude others.</p>
<p>It is true. Most Jews are not Orthodox. Most Jews do not celebrate Shabbat and the holidays the way that Orthodox Jews celebrate those days. Most Jews do not adhere to the strict rigors of halacha. So what? Why should those factors determine who is inside the tent? Who benefits by not allowing them into our tent? No one does.</p>
<p>The differences in observance might matter at some point. A Shabbat invitation will require that both parties are comfortable with the level of kashrut. A dating couple will need to be religiously compatible. There are a few examples, but they are only a few. It is up to the individual parties to try to find common ground. A tent is not needed to make these decisions for us.</p>
<p>Are we scared that some exposure to less halachically observant Jews will cause or own to run off and frolic in the fields with the less observant? Is the current edition of Orthodox Judaism so flimsy that mere interaction with others will cause it to crumble beneath the weight of enlightenment? I should hope not. If we have the truth, and I believe we do, what are we so afraid of?</p>
<p>As the rabbi of a shul that calls itself Orthodox but is a spiritual home to Jews (and non-Jews) of every single level of observance, I can attest that it can be done. Not only can it be done, it can be done in spectacular fashion. Our shul has something akin to a âDonât ask, donât tellâ policy. Anyone who wishes to pray and learn in our shul is welcome. There is no âTzitzis check.â There is no subgrouping based on observance. And it works. Sometimes there are awkward moments. But our relationships are more important than those moments of discomfort and I donât believe any of us would trade our friendships and shul family so that we would never have to think critically on our own about how we interact with others. I believe we have a viable model. I believe that we have a preferable model. I believe our tent is big enough for every Jewish person to find spiritual shelter together. I believe that firmly grabbing hold of the Modern Orthodox, non-isolationist view, we can return to a more authentic and traditional Judaism that empowers us to embrace Jew of all textures and flavors. It will allow us to break free from the limitations of a tent and it confining walls. Following this model, there is no tent.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4559" title="images" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images-300x127.jpg?resize=300%2C127" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The orthodox Jewish world is in tumult over the recent essays published by a local Los Angeles rabbi. <strong>Rabbi Yosef Kanefsky</strong> wrote a series of blog posts in varying tones explaining why he is unwilling to say the blessing where men thank God for not making them women. The exact text of the blessing reads:Â <em>Blessed are You, Lord our G-d, Master of the world, who did not create me a Woman.</em></p>
<p>This blessing comes from the <em>Talmud</em> quoting theÂ <em>Tosefta</em>. It has been part of Jewish liturgy for nearly 2000 years. Any tradition, be it religious or not, that has that kind of cachet cannot be discarded willy nilly.</p>
<p>Indeed, Rabbi Kanefsky justified his position by articulating something that many have felt when reciting or hearing this blessing:Â <em>by its plain meaning, and by the simple smell test, it has the effect today of justifying our lack of progress, and of affirming for us that women do not possess the spiritual dignity than men do.</em></p>
<p>There has been a very strong response from more traditionalist orthodox rabbis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/" target="_blank">One blog</a> has dedicated no less than four of its 28 blog posts in August to distancing itself from Rabbi Kanefsky and either by association, implication or explicitly tossed Rabbi Kanefsky out of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>There is much to say on this topic and much has already been said. My purpose in this blog post will be to deal with two separate issues. They could just as easily have their own independent blog posts. But I prefer one landing place for both of these issues.</p>
<p>The first issue relates to the actual blessing in question.</p>
<p>The second issue relates to the response from the traditionalists.<span id="more-4550"></span></p>
<h2><strong>The Blessing</strong></h2>
<p>It was 11 years ago that Senator Joe Lieberman famously said on Imus in the Morning that he does not say this blessing. My less than 20 year old brain was met with the tension between tradition and modernity. I decided then that it was necessary to understand the blessing and what it meant.</p>
<p>There are several apologist explanations for the blessing. They all basically say something along the lines of women are really on a higher level than men, they don&#8217;t need to do as many commandments, they can if they want, but they don&#8217;t have to, men need the commandments to lift men out of the abyss, the blessing recognizes that men are appreciative for having those commandment to elevate them and thanks God for that opportunity. It is not insulting to women because it is not about who is better, it is about appreciating having more commandments.</p>
<p>While this is somewhat enticing, it falls short. The next logical step is that if the commandments are not indicative of higher status rather lower status, why are we blessing God for that? Could it be that it is something like tziduk ha&#8217;din &#8211; thanking God for the bad as we do after a death? Â Unlikely. The other morning blessings do not follow this form.</p>
<p>Further, there are several medieval sources that actually say that the blessing is to thank God for for not making man a woman because women are not as special as men. It is certainly a viable explanation for the blessing. As I have written previously, I don&#8217;t blame the rabbis of the Talmud for thinking that way &#8211; if they did. They were subject to the social values of their era.</p>
<p>Chief Rabbi LordÂ <strong>Jonathan Sacks</strong> offers this explanation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;they are acknowledgments of the special responsibilities of Jewish life. Heathens, slaves and women are exempt from certain commandments that apply to Jewish men. In these blessings, we express our faith that the commandments are not a burden but a cherished vocation&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>In other words, the blessing is an affirmation that extra commandments are a privilege. Well, why doesn&#8217;t everyone have this privilege?</p>
<p>It is easy to see why the blessing is an affront to many women. It implies inferiority at worst or less opportunity at best. It could be argued that just because Judaism has some specific roles for men and women does not mean it deserves a blessing to that effect. I completely understand why some find it offensive.</p>
<p>Rabbi Kanefsky&#8217;s feelings about the blessing are justified. His actions are what are subject to scrutiny. His feelings are not.</p>
<p><em>(Here is what I think about the blessing: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/01/11/apropos-of-nothing-well-maybe-something-rabbi-julie-schonfeld-edition/" target="_blank">Apropos of Nothing</a>)</em></p>
<h2><strong>The Response</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Rabbi Shafran</strong> takes a strong stance against Rabbi Kanefsky. Rabbi Shafran&#8217;sÂ approach to orthodox Judaism is that things are not supposed to change. Commitment to orthodox Judaism and its <em>mesorah</em> mean accepting the status quo and not changing anything. In his mind, not saying the blessing is a change and simply because Rabbi Kanefsky is &#8220;big enough&#8221; to impose a change in orthodox Jewish liturgy, he can&#8217;t. Not only that, but making such a change is enough to push Rabbi Kanefsky out of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The punchline:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But when a contemporary rabbi, particularly one who has not yet garnered the wisdom that comes with many years of living and learning, proposes to reject an elementâany elementâof the Jewish mandate, there can be no question about his having relinquished the right to call himself Orthodox.</em></p>
<p><em></em>Speaking of change, a friend of mine put Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s opinion in perspective. The biggest innovation in the history of orthodox Judaism is that there is no innovation in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>This is especially true with regard to liturgy.</p>
<p>In orthodox Judaism there are three primary <em>nuschaos</em> (prayer styles). They all follow a basic formula but transferring from one to the next is a difficult proposition. There are enough words, sentences and paragraphs that would make it uncomfortable for one who prays using nusach A to lead the services for a nusach B congregation.</p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>Simple. Different communities felt different prayers were important enough to incorporate into their services. Some did. Some didn&#8217;t. Over hundreds of years some prayers were added, others were deleted.</p>
<p>In the Aleinu prayer a line was taken out because it was offensive to the non-Jewish community. Some have said it should be put back. Others leave it out. No harm; no foul.</p>
<p>My great-great-grandfather, Reb Elya Lopian, a Torah giant with impeccable credentials (the Brisker Rav said of him: He is what R&#8217; Yisrael Salanter had in mind when he created the Mussar movement) adjusted his personal prayers several ways. In the introduction to his classic work, Lev Eliyahu, we are told that Reb Elya did not say &#8220;<em>ki shem Hashem ekra</em>&#8230;&#8221; before his Mincha amida, When Reb Elya would lead the services on the High Holidays he would omit the line &#8220;<em>hineni he&#8217;ani mi&#8217;maas nir&#8217;as v&#8217;nifhad</em>&#8230;&#8221; because he felt it was not honest. He felt he wasn&#8217;t really afraid so he just skipped it. Reb Elya also changed the words of &#8220;<em>Elokai nitzor l&#8217;shoni</em>&#8221; into &#8220;<em>Elokeinu nitzor l&#8217;shonenu</em>&#8221; because he felt that the author of the prayer was honestly trying his hardest to avoid the things mentioned in the prayer, but we don&#8217;t necessarily try our hardest so how could we ask God to do it for us? Instead Reb Elya switched the words to be general prayer on behalf of everyone.</p>
<p>I have been told, although I can&#8217;t find it in the book, that on Tisha B&#8217;Av Reb Elya even omitted the references to Jerusalem being desolate and destroyed. His reasoning was how could he say those words when they were no longer true?</p>
<p>In short, prayer for Reb Elya was an exercise in truth and honesty. The rigidity of the words in his prayer book were not impenetrable barriers to be accepted without careful consideration.</p>
<p>There is precedent for changing prayers and adjusting the liturgy based on many factors.</p>
<p>Of course Rabbi Shafran knows this. His problem with Rabbi Kanefsky is two-fold. One, he is not &#8220;<em>choshuv</em>&#8221; enough to make changes. Two, Rabbi Shafran makes that disingenuous claim that orthodox Judaism does not change.</p>
<p>As to the first claim: This is a classic ad hominem attack. If the change is valid, the source of the change is irrelevant. Very weak argument by Rabbi Shafran.</p>
<p>As the second claim: The entire concept is a lie. Things do change, especially in the liturgy.</p>
<p>Rabbi Shafran, and anyone else for that matter, would be taken much more seriously if he would make an actual argument against the change other than &#8220;we don&#8217;t change&#8221;. Does he have such an argument? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>What does Rabbi Shafran really mean to say?</p>
<p>I think he means to say that changes that were made in the past were either needed, necessary or important enough to make. <em>This change is not</em>. In his opinion, the sensitivities of women who find this blessing offensive are not sufficient to warrant a change to the liturgy.</p>
<p>This is fair position. He can say it is not important enough <em>and others can disagree.</em>Â But by drawing the lines as he did, there is no room for discussion. One side is presenting halachic analysis and reasoning. The other is just closing its ears and saying &#8220;I can&#8217;t hear you&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think the way forward is to have a genuine discussion about the liturgy. Tossing your opponent out of orthodoxy doesn&#8217;t make the issue disappear nor does it win any argument.</p>
<p>As always, debate and discourse will provide the best way to analyze the issue and give orthodox Jews the tools they need to make the most appropriate informed decision for themselves.</p>

It is a day designated to Holocaust Remembrance. In the spirit of this special day I would like to share a story with you.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/" target="_blank">Cross-Currents</a>, <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/04/09/the-song-was-true/" target="_blank">Rabbi Adlerstein has linked</a> to a very powerful article in the Detroit News.</p>
<p>Most Orthodox Jews have heard the song called &#8220;The Man From Vilna&#8221; by Abie Rottenberg. It tells a powerful story in post liberation Europe. <span id="more-2349"></span>It was the day of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simchat_Torah" target="_blank">Simchas Torah</a>, a grand celebration at the completion of the weekly Torah readings. Typically, the day is marked by feverish dancing and rejoicing for hours while holding the Sefer Torah Scroll. However, on this dark day the synagogue in Vilna had no Sefer Torah. They had been destroyed by the Nazis.</p>
<p>A Jewish Russian soldier spotted a young boy. This was an anomoly as most young children were killed in the holocaust. But this boy was hidden in a convent during the war and had survived. The soldier scooped up the boy and danced with the boy as if he were the Sefer Torah Scroll. His act symbolized to all that although the physical Torah Scrolls were destroyed and Six Million Jews had been killed, the Torah and Judaism live on through the next generation of children.</p>
<p>After that moment, they never saw each other again.</p>
<p>Until last week.</p>
<p>They finally met for the first time in 65 years. They both remembered that incredible day and that poignant moment all this time. It was a very emotional reunion.</p>
<p>Like many great stories, people thought of this as a legend, with perhaps some basis in reality. But these two men confirmed its veracity. It also identifies the two men as prominent Jewish leaders. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Foxman" target="_blank">Abe Foxman </a>was the boy and he is the New York based director of Anti-Defamation league and Leo Grossman, was the soldier and became the Rabbi of Shaarey Shamayim Synagogue in Oak Park Michigan. Their story and inspiration became inspiration for others as well as action in their lives for others.</p>
<p>I recommend reading the <a href="http://detnews.com/article/20100409/OPINION03/4090372" target="_blank">article in the Detroit News</a>.</p>
<p>Someone has taken the song and made a homemade music video. I have included the video below:</p>

<p>Since the Earthquake in Haiti many have attempted to figure out &#8220;why&#8221; the tragedy occurred.</p>
<p>There are 4 prominent versions going around the web right now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/01/22/the-earth-trembles/" target="_blank">Rabbi Shafran Version 1</a>: God punished the people of Haiti because of evil speech.<br />
<a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/01/27/a-personal-note-to-cross-currents-readers/" target="_blank">Rabbi Shafran Version 2</a>: We don&#8217;t know why God punished the people of Haiti but the lesson is that we should learn is not to speak evil speech.<br />
<a href="http://www.frumsatire.net/2010/02/03/presenting-rabbi-yehuda-levin/" target="_blank">Rabbi Levin</a>: The earthquake and Tsunami and 9/11 happened because of Gays in the military.<br />
<a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/02/02/haiti-and-the-mind-of-g-d/" target="_blank">Rabbi Feldman</a>: We can&#8217;t know why the earthquake happened, but it happened for &#8220;a reason&#8221;.</p>
<p>What has been missing from this is a more rational approach<span id="more-2094"></span> predicated on the teachings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Weinberg" target="_blank">Rav Yaakov Weinberg</a> Ztz&#8221;l Rosh Yeshiva of Ner Yisrael.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with a hypothetical question.</p>
<p>Gerald is driving through the desert. He gets lost and runs out of fuel. He gets out of the car to start walking to find a gas station. He wanders for a little while. Eventually he runs out of water. He dehydrates and eventually dies in the desert.</p>
<p>Why did he die?</p>
<p>That is easy. He died because he ran out of water in a desert. The rules of nature that God created and recreates every moment dictate that when a man has no water in a desert he will dehydrate and probably die shortly thereafter. God does not bend or adjust the rules of nature to save him. Nor should God bend the rules of nature. The relationship God has with the world is that of a hidden God. God hides behind the mask of nature and does not show Himself.</p>
<p>There is a fault line the lies beneath Port Au Prince. <a href="http://www.haitixchange.com/index.php/hx/Articles/possibilty-of-earthquake-in-port-au-prince//" target="_blank">It was suggested by geologists in late 2008</a> that there could be a severe earthquake in Haiti as a result of this fault line. In January 2010 the plates along the fault line shifted. A massive earthquake ensued. Thousands of people died and many more were injured.</p>
<p>Why did they die?</p>
<p>That is also easy. They died because there was an earthquake. The rules of nature that God created and recreates at every moment dictate that when tectonic plates shift it can cause a massive earthquake. God does not bend or adjust the rules of nature to stop the earthquake. Nor should God bend the rules of nature. The relationship God has with the world is that of a hidden God. God hides behind the mask of nature and does not show Himself.</p>
<p>What about the stories in Chumash and Tanach (Old Testament) that report miracles to save individuals or groups of people?</p>
<p>Once in a while God does bend the rules of nature. This is rare and only happens in extreme circumstances. We call this a miracle. It is really a misnomer because everything is a miracle. Nature is a miracle just as much as the supernatural. But we only recognize or would recognize the supernatural miraculous. Miracles can happen, but we don&#8217;t rely on miracles nor do we expect miracles as part of the usual system and order of the universe. The universe follows the rules of nature that God created and recreates every moment.</p>
<p>What about the words of Chazal (Talmudic Rabbis) that blame natural disasters on sin?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t answer with certainty but there are a few options:</p>
<p>&#8211; For lack of scientific information they did not realize that earthquakes or other phenomena were &#8220;natural&#8221; and supposed they were supernatural events thus requiring a Divine reason.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were referring to a place and time where God did intervene on a constant basis.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were speaking polemically and urging Klal Yisrael to improve their ways and as a way of admonishing them they used exegesis to connect disaster with sin.</p>
<p>&#8211; They were misquoted or quoted out of context.</p>
<p>Then there is the Rambam. In hilchos Taanis, the Rambam states that when harm befalls the tzibur it incumbent upon klal yisrael to do teshuva and attribute the suffering the &#8220;way of the world&#8221; rather the bad things that happened were because of their evil sins.</p>
<p>This has been misquoted and misapplied in many instances. The Rambam is talking about a tragedy that happens to the tzibur. The tzibur refers to the Jewish community. So a harm among the a specific Jewish community is the time that we must attribute the harm to OUR sins.</p>
<p>What Rabbis Shafran Version 1, Feldman and Levin are doing is trying to use this Rambam in an instance of a tragedy that befell ANOTHER group of people. The earthquake was not a disaster that happened to the Jewish tzibur. It happened to another tzibur. Thus, the Rambam does not apply.</p>
<p>When would the Rambam apply? At most a tragedy that targets the tzibur. Most strictly constructed it would be when a harm is specific to the Jewish people.</p>
<p>So what are we supposed to do when tragedy strikes? When there is a Hurricane like Katrina, a Tsunami like there was in Southeast Asia or Earthquake like in Haiti?</p>
<p>We work on our compassion. We work on our empathy. We help as much as we can. We remember that life is fleeting and it can all end in a moment. We try to reenergize our relationships. We improve in our avodas Hashem. We find a way to use the tragedy to inspire us. It is personal.</p>
<p>For anyone to assume they know why this tragedy happened fails on three counts.</p>
<p>1) It did not happen to us. It happened to someone else. Do we believe in a God who punishes another party for OUR sins?</p>
<p>2) Maybe it did not happen for a reason? If it was natural then how are you going to apply some sin as the cause for nature? Do you blame sin every time a lion eats a gazelle in the African plain? How about when an innocent bystander is killed by a drunk driver? Did the bystander &#8220;deserve it&#8221;?</p>
<p>3) Even if it did happen for a reason, who are you to tell me why it happened? You think YOU know? Your puny little brain can figure out why God acts in the way He does? You know all the factors that go into &#8220;causing a natural disaster&#8221;? At best it is presumptuous at worst it is extreme arrogance bordering on apikorsus.</p>
<p>For anyone to guess why this happened fails on another count.</p>
<p>Nevuah (prophecy) ended thousands of years ago. A Navi (prophet) was like a spiritual doctor, one was able to see a Navi and ask why bad things were happening to you and the Navi could tell you why. The Navi was connected to God. That is over. It ended a long time ago. I am suspect of anyone claiming to know what God is &#8220;thinking&#8221; because they have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Trying to pretend like we know why the earthquake happened, even if we assume it happened for a reason, is wrong.</p>
<p>But at least Rabbi Shafran Version 2 and Rabbi Feldman are telling US to improve our lives in the wake of the tragedy.</p>
<p>Only one goofball has the gall to tell OTHER people how to act in response to the tragedy. Only Levin has the audacity to tell the Government of the USA that it&#8217;s &#8220;their fault&#8221; this happened. Only Levin completely abrogates himself and places the blame on something that is external to him and his group.</p>
<p>It is akin to telling a grieving mother that her son who was run over by a car was run over because the lady across the street had an affair. Ridiculous. Irresponsible. Self-righteous. Idiotic. Moronic. (Help me out hereâ¦ I am sure there are more wordsâ¦)</p>
<p>In summary, there are varying levels of what I believe to be errors in the wake of this tragedy. The least egregious is trying to figure what the precise message of the earthquake is. The most egregious is telling a 3rd party that they caused the tragedy of another.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/14/jewish-relief-efforts-for-haiti-earthquake-victims/" target="_blank">My view, as I stated just after the earthquake</a>, and the view of my Rebbeim is that the tragedy was a natural disaster. There was no malicious intent or direct message being sent to the people of Haiti or anyone else for that matter. However, it is useful for us to use the incident as inspiration to improve our lives and live each moment we are fortunate to be alive as a way of making the world a better place.</p>
<p><em>Postscript: A worthwhile read is <a href="http://rabbidmk.posterous.com/how-can-g-d-allow-natural-disasters" target="_blank">Rabbi Dov Kramer&#8217;s approach</a> which is very similar to what is written here just comes from a different direction.</em></p>
