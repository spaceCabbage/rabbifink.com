				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Kosher Switch has been in development for several years. According to the inventor, the device replaces the standard light switch and through the magic of technology and Jewish law allows Shabbat observant Jews to switch their lights on and off. Last week, the company launched a campaign on Indiegogo to raise funds to satisfy minimum manufacturer requirements and begin production. The promotional video claims that leading rabbinic authorities approve the device for Shabbat use. In response, a proclamation signed by prominent American rabbinic authorities warned residents of Flatbush that the device was not kosher for Shabbat use and it should not be brought into one&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>A lot of the subsequent discussion has been somewhat juvenile. Questions about motive, credibility, and consistency have been raised in all directions and accusations of impropriety have been levied as well. To me, this is all just a distraction from the real issue here: <strong>Is the Kosher Switch Kosher? [Please show your work]</strong></p>
<p>Instead of delving into the religio-legal issues raised by the Kosher Switch, I find far too much of the discourse to be declarative and even in the rare case that arguments are made in favor or against the device, the articles read like persuasive briefs instead of dispassionate legal jurisprudence. I have read everything I could find and would like to present both sides of the issue as I see it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Needless to say, this discussion is for educational purposes only. If you are looking for a psak, ask a posek.</strong></em><span id="more-9185"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Prohibition</strong></p>
<p>I. Flipping a light switch on Shabbat might be a Biblical prohibition, but according to many opinions it might be a rabbinic prohibition.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9190" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/electricity-05.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="electricity-05" data-recalc-dims="1" /> If it is Biblical, one set of principles applies, and if it is rabbinic, another package of principles apply. Activating a circuit is presumed to be prohibited, but as has been noted, it&#8217;s extremely difficult to identify the actual prohibition. Lighting an incandescent bulb is the most likely candidate for Biblical prohibition due to the heating of the coils and the heat that it emits. But we live in a fluorescent world, and I think we can assume that the Kosher Switch is trying to solve a rabbinic problem as opposed to a Biblical problem.</p>
<p>II. The Torah forbids mindful acts of Shabbat desecration. Thus, there are several leniencies that can theoretically mitigate Biblical prohibition. When one performs an action that unwittingly causes a prohibited result it is permissible. This is called davar sh&#8217;eino mitkaven. But the leniency only applies as long as the unintended result was not inevitable, otherwise it is prohibited. This principle is called psik reisha, and the action is Biblically prohibited. However, if the unintended result of the action is undesirable it is called a psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei and it is not Biblically prohibited. There is a dispute among the Medieval commentators whether a psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei is still rabbinically prohibited or if it is permissible.</p>
<p>III. There is a secondary dispute among the late Medieval and Renaissance commentators when a psik reisha only produces a rabbinically prohibited result. Some say it is still prohibited rabbinically, and others say it is completely permissible. Even those who prohibit in these cases may allow psik reisha d&#8217;lo nicha lei. Some prohibit even in such cases, and others only allow under certain conditions.</p>
<p>IV. When it&#8217;s unknown if the psik reisha resulted in a prohibition it is called a safeik psik reisha. One late Renaissance opinion holds this would not even be considered a psik reisha, and is not prohibited at all. One Contemporary authority rules that safeik psik reisha is permissible when the result is rabbinically prohibited.</p>
<p><strong>Proximate Cause</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Indirectly causing a prohibited result is called grama. The Talmud offers two seemingly contradictory positions on grama. One is permitted to place vessels filled with water in the path of a fire. The fire will be extinguished by the water in the vessels, and extinguishing fire is normally prohibited. The Talmud explains that this is a permissible case of grama. However, the Talmud also prohibits tossing wheat with its chaff into the wind to separate the kernel from the chaff, even though that appears to be a grama as well. Several narrowing definitions of grama have been proposed to reconcile this issue.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>When there is a time lapse between the action and the result it is considered a grama. It will take some time for the water to be released from the vessels but the chaff will be removed from the wheat almost immediately.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is only when the indirect cause is the normal manner in which the result is achieved. Normally, one would not extinguish a fire by placing vessels of water in its path, but one <em>would</em> toss wheat in the air to winnow.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is only when the person completes the indirect act, and an intervening act is still needed to cause the prohibited result. The water is trapped in vessels that are a distance away from the fire, so the fire must travel and burst the vessels.  In the case of the wheat, the wind is <em>already</em> blowing when one throws the wheat in the air.</li>
<li>Or perhaps grama is only when the prohibited result is not inevitable. There is no guarantee that the fire will be extinguished by the water in the vessels but it&#8217;s certain that the wind will remove some chaff from the wheat.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Grama is not a blanket permission. The general consensus is that grama is only allowed in cases of great need. Some Modern and Contemporary authorities hold that grama would also be permissible when the result is not desired.</li>
<li>One Contemporary rabbinic authority holds that oneg Shabbat (pleasure of Shabbat) is considered a great need.   <strong><br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Not Even a Grama</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>The foremost Renaissance halachic authority for Ashkenazi Jewry says one can leave a candle near a door if the wind is not blowing, even if the wind will eventually blow. He also holds that grama is only permissible in cases of financial loss, and since here he makes no such stipulation, it can be assumed that he holds this is not even a case of grama.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is when the other contributing factor causing the prohibition exists. But where the wind is not blowing, the thing that is needed to complete the act does not even exist at the time of human act.</li>
<li>Perhaps grama is when the human act is <em>connected</em> to the thing that will complete the prohibited act. The human is only opening a door to let the wind blow. The wind is the thing doing the extinguishing and the act is not connected to the wind.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Kosher Switch</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Basically, two things are happening inside the Kosher Switch. First, there is an emitter and a receiver that complete a circuit. When the emitter and receiver are active, the circuit is complete and the light is on. The second component is a barrier that creates a blockage between emitter and receiver when the switch is flipped.</li>
<li>When the light is on, the emitter and receiver cycle through sleep and active periods and an indicator will tell the user when they are asleep. The user will move the barrier by flipping the switch, and at a random time, the emitter will try to connect to the receiver. If it cannot connect, the circuit will be disrupted and the light will turn off. When the emitter and receiver are sleeping, an indicator tells the user it&#8217;s safe to move the switch. If the barrier is moved, the emitter and receiver will communicate at a random time and will attempt to complete the circuit. Even when the barrier is removed, the emitter and receiver do not automatically connect. They both randomly generate codes that must &#8220;match&#8221; in order to complete the circuit. After each failed attempt, the emitter will try connected again at a random time. If the barrier has not been moved, the emitter will not see the receiver and the light will remain off.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Show Your Work</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Flipping the Kosher Switch does not directly turn the lights on or off.<img class="alignright wp-image-9188 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/KosherSwitch1.jpg?resize=449%2C600" alt="KosherSwitch1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></li>
<li>Assuming it is considered a psik reisha, the result is a rabbinically prohibited act. This is permissible according to some authorities.</li>
<li>Assuming a psik reisha that produces a rabinically prohibited act is still prohibited, the act of flipping the switch might be a safeik psik reisha. This is permissible according to some authorities.</li>
<li>It might be a grama because there is a time lapse between the switch flip and the circuit completing.</li>
<li>It might be a grama because an intervening act, by the emitter and receiver, is needed to complete the circuit.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s possible that it could be a grama because the Kosher Switch is not the normal manner one turns on a light. Maybe.</li>
<li>If the light is considered oneg Shabbat, grama plus a &#8220;great need&#8221; would render the switch permissible according to some.</li>
<li>It might not be a grama at all, because the current is totally dead at the time of the act. Non-grama is certainly permissible.</li>
<li>Or it might not be grama at all because the human act is not connected to the emitter and receiver. The human act only connects to the switch and barrier.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Objections</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Rabbi Rozen says: &#8220;Even if they added to the ‘Grama’ additional apparatuses, and even if there is a one in a thousand chance that the action will not occur, I have received from my rabbis (R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and R. Shaul Yisraeli) that this does not change in any way the halakhic status of regular ‘grama’ (just like grama D’grama and other artificial arrangements).&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Rozen says: &#8220;Even if the method of operation is non-active from the point of view of the agent, i.e. because he merely removes the “preventing element,” Rabbi S. Z. Auerbach and others wrote that this remains forbidden and is treated like it was done directly by the person, since the action occurs immediately after the human intervention/action. Even if the result comes only after a delay caused by an additional factor, this is plain grama, which is still not permitted L’chatchila.&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Student argues that the Kosher Switch is only a grama according to some opinions and even a grama is not permissible ab initio.</li>
<li>Rabbi Tzvi Ortner says: &#8220;We must question whether a case can be built for permissibility based on what the Gemara does not say. That is, the fact that the Gemara does not speak of the halacha of something that has not entered the world does not prove that this case is less than a grama. Perhaps this case is deemed a grama too!&#8221;</li>
<li>Rabbi Tzvi Ortner says: &#8220;Even should this logic be sound, one can hardly call the pulses “not in this world,” since the switch is designed for the function to turn on intermittently. It is an absolute certainty that the force will come back into existence, and this is by design. Even if we could find a case of wind that is not “in this world” that is permissible, this is only because the effect is not under man’s control, which thus “distances” his action from the eventual force (see Magen Avraham 328:53). However, the pulses in the Kosher Switch are designed and controlled by man to arrive with continuity, and thus bear no comparison to the case of the wind, which is beyond his control.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Possible Responses</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
<li>Okay, but there is precedent for &#8220;not even grama&#8221; under similar circumstances. Not everyone has to agree with what you received from your rabbis.</li>
<li>Right, but this is a switch that is delayed and also dependent on random emitter and receiver contact which could have legal implications according to some precedents. Further, even if it is a grama, it could be combined with oneg Shabbat to establish a &#8220;great need.&#8221;</li>
<li>There is a solid argument, with precedent, to say that it is not even grama. And again, even if it is grama it might be okay.</li>
<li>The Talmud doesn&#8217;t say it, but the foremost Renaissance rabbinic authority seems to hold this way.</li>
<li>Sure, this is possible. But so is the alternative proposed by Kosher Switch proponents. It might be different than the wind, but it might be similar as well.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So there you have it. A legitimate discussion about Kosher Switch from a religio-legal perspective.</p>
<p>It seems like two things might be happening here. It&#8217;s possible that the opponents of the Kosher Switch did not read through the responsa on the Kosher Switch website. All their questions are covered in their materials. But I think there is something deeper happening here as well. I have a feeling that the Kosher Switch proponents are using a different paradigm than the opponents.</p>
<p>The opponents seem to hold that in order for something to be permissible it needs to work according to all established rabbinic authorities. The Kosher Switch certainly does not meet that bar. Kosher Switch proponents hold that in order for something to be prohibited it needs to not work according to all established rabbinic authorities. Unfortunately, both sides seem to believe that their approach is the only correct approach so they do not acknowledge the validity of their opponents.</p>
<p>This represents a huge gap between two acceptable ways to look at halacha. I do think that the idea that we should try to satisfy all halachic precedent has some roots in the Talmud. But the importance and universal emphasis we give to this idea is somewhat a new innovation. It&#8217;s prominent in the Mishna Berura, a 20th century compilation and commentary on one section of the Code of Jewish Law. The Chofetz Chaim seems to have attempted to select and codify the halachic opinions that were most universally held. Today, the idea is very prominent in Brisk and its progeny. The hallmark of this approach is its lack of self confidence and self reliance. We are nervous that we are not doing it right so we try to fulfill as many positions as possible because one of them has got to be right.</p>
<p>We also have a tradition of &#8220;koach d&#8217;hetera adif&#8221; &#8211; the power to permit is great, and the concept of &#8220;limud zechus&#8221; &#8211; trying to find any halachic path to justify questionable behavior. The Aruch HaShulchan, by Rav Yechiel Michel Epstein, an exhaustive restatement of Jewish law written in the late 19th century, is known for its efforts on this side of the halachic coin. Rabbi Epstein tried to be machria and choose a path but he presented a potpourri of acceptable opinions in every section. It seems that this tradition is less prominent in our society. The hallmark of this approach is autonomy and courage. We try to research a topic as best we can, and attempt to forge a personal path that rings true to our genuinely held religious convictions.</p>
<p>I do harbor some concerns that our preference for the former over the latter is having a net negative impact on 21st century Orthodox Judaism. A society that looks for stringencies and looks down upon those with a different approach to Jewish law can become extremely uncomfortable for its non-conformist constituents. Autonomy and self confidence are authentic Torah values too. We ignore them at our peril.</p>
<p>This dispute might be a case study of this dichotomy or I might be completely off the mark, but either way, researching this topic inspired this idea in me. I believe there is a valid halachic path that permits the Shabbos Switch. I also acknowledge that this path will not be universally held. I think that&#8217;s okay. Variety and diversity can be good things. Let&#8217;s try to bring a little more of that back into our world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After years of research and development, a man-made hamburger was publicly tasted for the first time last week. The burger was not animal flesh, instead it was grown in a laboratory. However, it was grown in a way that mimics the way animals grow their own flesh. Thus, it was pretty close to dead animal meat in flavor and texture.</p>
<p>This incredible scientific breakthrough prompted a plethora of questions. For the religious community with rituals and laws attached to the eating of meat even more questions were asked.<span id="more-7459"></span></p>
<p>It seemed that one could hardly browse the Internet for five seconds without seeing a juicy soundbite (sorry, couldn&#8217;t resist) about whether the meat was kosher or whether is was meat at all. Chabad&#8217;s website had one approach. OU had another approach. Reuters had a third opinion in their article. NBC added another view.</p>
<p>I must have been asked by a dozen people what to make of the man-made meat mystery.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7460" alt="k-bigpic" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/k-bigpic.gif?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This is what I think. No one has any idea what they are talking about. Non-scientists have no chance of understanding the precise manner in which this meat was manufactured. I have tried to understand how it all works and it is almost impossible to find the full technical explanation with all the requisite background information. A very smart scientists tried explaining it to me, but even after I got the gist of the process I had more questions about stem cells and other background than I had before he explained it to me. I am pretty confident that Chabad, OU, the Reuters people, and even NBC News reporters don&#8217;t have a clue how this meat is made.</p>
<p>Sure, they  say &#8220;don&#8217;t rely on this for halacha&#8221; or something to that effect, but that makes things even worse. Why offer a meaningless opinion that is based on ignorance? It seems to make a mockery of Jewish law. But Jewish law is very serious and serious people will offer serious opinions on this matter. The proper response for almost the entire population of planet Earth to these eternal questions about man-made meat is &#8220;I am not qualified to render an opinion on this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a thorough understanding of how the meat is made, any discussion of the halachic ramifications of the meat is not even conjecture. It is pure fantasy. Further, deciding the halachic status of this issue will require a breadth of Torah knowledge that is possessed by a mere handful of people on the planet. You can&#8217;t <em>pasken</em> this <em>shyla</em> with Yad Moshe, Google, or the Otzar. This is a brand new question of Jewish law and will need serious investigation into the science and the various tenuously analogous precedents in Jewish law. The Torah does not discuss synthetic meat. And even if it did, who says this meat would be the same as the synthetic meat found in Jewish law?</p>
<p>The only way this question can be seriously answered is with a conference of scientists and rabbis who fit the descriptions above. Scientists who can thoroughly explain how the meat is made and Torah scholars who know <em>kol haTorah kula</em> will need to decide this issue. Anyone else jumping into the discussion is wielding a knife in a nuclear war. It&#8217;s that useless.</p>
<p>If I can, I will try to attain a scientific understanding of how this meat is produced and then perhaps I will be qualified to even ask the question to my (qualified) <em>posek.</em> But until such time, I wouldn&#8217;t dare wade into this very, very deep pool. I think this is the proper policy under the circumstances. We sound more educated and cutting edge when we admit what we don&#8217;t know as opposed to when we pretend we know what we are discussing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/life-preserver.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7244" alt="life-preserver" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/life-preserver.jpg?resize=300%2C225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I don’t think it matters much what Jewish law would say about the government snooping on its citizens. The government is not subject to Jewish law and its citizens don’t expect the government to conform its policies to Jewish law. Yet, there seems to be value in such analysis as I have been asked this question by several people.</p>
<p>As is often the case, we have two competing interests at stake. Privacy on one hand and safety on the other. Both of these interests are recognized in Jewish law. But they are completely different planes.</p>
<p>Life is primary in Jewish law. All else comes after life. One is not permitted to kill. One is not permitted to commit suicide. One is not permitted to harm one self. One is not permitted to place one’s life in danger. One is obligated to violate Jewish law in order to save one’s own life (with three exceptions &#8211; murder, idolatry, and adultery). The sanctity of life is of the utmost importance in Jewish law. These particular laws are derived from primary sources in the Torah and Mishna.<span id="more-7243"></span></p>
<p>There is also a prohibition against snooping on one’s neighbor in Jewish law. One is not permitted to place a window overlooking one’s neighbor’s private property. This sort of loss of privacy gives rise to a civil action in Jewish court. Some authorties extend right of privacy to include eavesdropping or even accidentally hearing others in private conversation.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is standing prohibtion in Jewish law against sharing anything revealed in private conversation. Without specifically stating that a conversation is allowed to be shared, it is required to be kept in confidence.</p>
<p>Finally, much later on in Jewish legal history a ban was placed on reading the private communications of others. This decree originally applied to mail but many authorities now extend it to all forms of communication.</p>
<p>These considerations all apply today and would apply to governments as well.</p>
<p>However, none of these considerations overrides the sanctity of life. If just one life could be saved it seems that all these rules could be ignored. Certainly, it would be expected that the minimal intrusion to save the life would be made. Saving a life is not a license to do as one pleases. Further, use of the information gathered would be limited to the purpose of saving lives and nothing else.The interesting thing here is that one life is enough for all our privacy to be suspended. One life is all it takes.</p>
<p>It would seem that as long as lives are being saved, the government is not bound by the strict privacy laws or decrees. The question then becomes whether lives are actually being saved. I don’t know the answer to that question. But that is the issue. It is the only issue.If there is a threat of loss of life, the government or any private citizen would have the right and according to some authorities the obligation to spy on its citizens to protect others.</p>
<p>I think it is laudible that the government takes the lives of its citizens so seriously. Obviously there are concerns that the government will use the information obtained improperly. However, there can be no prohibition against the gathering of the information so long as lives are at stake.</p>

It seems that Bynum makes the news every off-season for some reason or another.</p>
<p>This is the second time he made news in a shopping mall parking lot. Last time it was Kobe Bryant saying to ship him out on video while in a parking lot. This time, Bynum was caught on camera parking his car in a handicapped spot.</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, it is not a big deal. People do it all the time. Who could forget the time <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YHz493rnLw" target="_blank">George Costanza needed a parking spot in a pinch so he pulled into the handicapped spot</a>?</p>
<p>Of course, the Bynum haters have used this to prove how immature Bynum is. It&#8217;s hard to take such criticism seriously because Andrew Bynum is only 23 years old. At that age, being immature is normal.</p>
<p>The incident resonated with me for a completely different reason.<span id="more-4461"></span></p>
<p>Laws in secular countries, like the USA, are man made rules. For every rule there is a reaction, punishment, fine and stigma associated with the breaking of the rule. Commit murder and the punishment may be the death penalty, or life without possibility of parole (ie death in prison). Get caught speeding, you get a fine for a few hundred dollars. Skip out on paying your taxes, risk jailtime and a heavy fine.</p>
<p>The punishments may be deterrents, forms of retribution, attempts to rehabilitate or simply incapacitation. If you are willing to pay the price, there&#8217;s nothing really stopping you from breaking the law. It&#8217;s a risk / reward analysis.</p>
<p>If someone is able to afford speeding tickets, they can choose to speed and pay the fine is they get caught. For Andrew Bynum the risk of getting a ticket (he didn&#8217;t) did not outweigh the reward of parking up close. Is this immature? Sure. Is it a reasonable way of thinking within our system? I think so.</p>
<p>But when contrasted with a system of religious law, like Jewish law, another possibility enters the picture.</p>
<p>In Jewish law, there is a moral imperative to follow the law. This means that even if you want to break the law and take your punches and suffer the eternal punishment, you have acted immorally. In fact, the rabbis teach us that if someone says &#8220;I will sin and then repent, even the forgiveness attained on Yom Kippur won&#8217;t forgive that sin&#8221;. In religious law, the act is wrong. The punishment is incentive to do the right thing. But the law represents the right thing.</p>
<p>Now, I am not advocated a system of religious law in any free country. That would be a terrible idea. How can there be freedom when there is a system of law that only works for some people? (And calls non-believers heretics / infidels etc.?)</p>
<p>But if I had all the money in the world, there would still be an imperative for me not to take that handicap spot. Jewish law requires giving up a seat (or in this case, parking spot) for anyone elderly or infirm. Parking in the spot might be okay, but if someone who needs the spot comes by and is forced to take a different spot, I (may) have violated the law. Religious law superimposed on top of secular law can work very well. In this case, there would be no risk / reward analysis. It would not matter if I was willing to pay the price. If it is wrong, I cannot do it. Driving recklessly would fall under the same category. In Jewish law, one is not permitted to put their life in danger. Driving too fast is dangerous. Even if I am willing to pay the fine, I can&#8217;t drive so fast that it would dangerous because it is wrong to do so.</p>
<p>Andrew Bynum acted in a way that is consistent with how secular law works. Having a religious law to superimpose on those laws could go a long way to not rationalizing breaking the law.</p>
<p>How timely are the <a href="http://www.chiefrabbi.org/ReadArtical.aspx?id=1781" target="_blank">words of the Chief Rabbi</a> of  the UK, Rabbi Jonathan Sacks on this week&#8217;s Torah portion:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The Torah sets forth a&#8230; way, in which people obey the law because they have voluntarily undertaken to do so. This is a society based not on power or the pursuit of self-interest but on freely embraced moral obligation.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/koran2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3957" title="koran2" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/koran2.jpg?resize=300%2C244" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Fox News is reporting, and one of my Facebook friends is bleating, that a &#8220;Florida judge is defending his controversial decision to apply Islamic law instead of state or federal statutes in determining whether an arbitration award was correct&#8221;.</p>
<p>What this means is that a dispute arose between Muslims. It is some lawsuit about trustees on a board of a Mosque. Before the dispute, they agreed to go to &#8220;arbitration&#8221; to settle any future dispute. The arbitrator was to be an Imam and he was to be instructed to use Islamic law to settle the case. They did just that and I guess the losing party decided to give the American legal system a shot. The judge decided that the arbitration was binding and that the parties could not pursue futher litigation in the secular courts.</p>
<p>This is being portrayed as Sharia law creeping into America. For some, it is the confirmation they need that &#8220;the end is near&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fox News calls this a &#8220;controversial decision&#8221;.</p>
<p>Conservatives are pulling their hair out over this.</p>
<p>This makes me afraid.<span id="more-3956"></span></p>
<p>Orthodox Jews use a similar system of arbitration to settle disputes between Orthodox Jews. The Jewish courts apply Jewish law and are held as binding by American courts. The Jewish courts are called Beis Din and their decisions are accepted as binding arbitration by the legal system.</p>
<p>In fact, here is a quote from an Illinois appeal from someone who was excommunicated in Beis Din and sued the Beis Din for intentional infliction of emotional distress:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Plaintiff has aligned himself with this particular Orthodox Jewish community and by doing so has accepted its laws, rules and procedures. One of these laws, of which plaintiff admits he was aware, allows for excommunication where, as here, the Rabbinic Court determines that plaintiff has refused three consecutive summonses to appear before it. Because of plaintiff&#8217;s actions and knowledge of this community&#8217;s rules and practices, the actions of the Rabbinical Court of which plaintiff complains are not so outrageous as to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thomas v. Fuerst 345 Ill.App.3d 929</em></p>
<p>The secular courts are very deferential to the religious courts when the parties have agreed to use a religious court. Jews have experienced this many many times.</p>
<p>Thus, the Florida judge is doing exactly what he is supposed to do. There is no controversy here. This is not Sharia law taking over America. It is the laws of binding arbitration as applied to Islamic Law in nearly the EXACT same way it applies to Jewish Law.</p>
<p>So take a chill pill Fox News and your insane commenters.</p>
<p>Insane commenters like this one:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This judge should be removed from his seat and disbarred!There is n place in America for sharia law!If one wants to be more sharia compliant they need to pack all belongings and move to another country where these clowns are tolerated.THIS I AMERICA comply by OUR rules or get out!</em></p>
<p>Um, hello? The judge is applying American law. Got it?</p>
<p>Fair and balanced?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/confidential.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3365" title="confidential" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/confidential.jpg?resize=253%2C241" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Wikileaks people are at it again. Somehow they have gained access to millions of confidential files and secrets of international importance. They feel that information is power. They want the people to have that power.</p>
<p>To some, this is a noble cause. A revolution of sorts. It is the people demanding accountability from their governments and leaders. I think that is important. A Libertarian Facebook friend says that the Wikileaks folks belong in the Libertarian Hall of Fame. When the government cannot hide behind confidentiality, it diminishes their power. Libertarians are happy to see the government&#8217;s power marginalized.</p>
<p>To others, this is a disaster. Secrets are out. Feelings are hurt. Nations will be pitted against each other due to the revelations found in the Wikileaks. People may lose their jobs. A war could break out. There are a lot of reasons to oppose the Wikileaks.</p>
<p>It seems like it&#8217;s darned if you do and darned if you don&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p>It got me thinking about what the Jewish approach would be to this issue.<span id="more-3364"></span> It&#8217;s actually not so simple either. But there is a formula for determining whether the Wikileaks would be a prohibited form of speech or permissible speech.</p>
<p>Jewish law highly regulates speech. One may not gossip, lie, use profanity, tell false stories about others, engage in fraudulant representation by their words among many other speech crimes. The emphasis on purity of speech is explained as a way of ensuring that the tool we use to communicate with God and the tool we use to study the words of God should be as fined tuned as possible. Using our lips for evil blunts the effect of that tool. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/06/14/manhattan-high-school-for-girls-on-pbs-dont-speak-lashon-hara/">Manhattan High School For Girls on PBS: Don&#8217;t Speak Lashon Hara</a>)</p>
<p>Another area of regulated speech is confidentiality. The Talmud says: <em>Rabbah stated that “if a man had said something to his neighbor the latter must not spread the news without the informant&#8217;s telling him ‘Go and say it.”</em></p>
<p><em></em>And thus the law is codified. Any information that is given to you, must be treated as confidential unless you have explicit permission to share the information. This is quite a departure from the contemporary worldview of information. Everything is a scoop. TMZ exists. That is enough of a proof that Jewish law is on its head in our society.</p>
<p>With all the speech regulation, one would have to assume there are exceptions. And there are. There is a caveat to almost all speech regulation in Jewish law. If there is an important reason to disclose the information, then the information may be disclosed. Further, if there are lives to be saved by disclosing the information, then one may be obligated to disclose the information. For example, one is not permitted to relate harmful information to another. However,  if the circumstances arise, one must go to the Jewish court to relate the information to the court.</p>
<p>There are millions of documents in the Wikileaks. All of the information is either explicitly confidential or implicitly confidential as there is no express consent to the sharing of the information. Using the standard of Jewish law, these documents are not permitted to be shared. Not by the &#8220;leaker&#8221; to the Wikileaks and not by the Wikileaks either.</p>
<p>But we do have exceptions. Will any of the millions of documents save lives? Perhaps. Will any of the confidential information satisfy the bar of an important reason to share confidential information? It is likely.</p>
<p>So, is there a simple answer to the question of whether the Wikileaks would be permissible to share under Jewish law. But as usual, there is a useful system for answering the question. And as always, it is better to have asked than to have not asked at all.</p>

<p><em>First they came for people who sit and lie on sidewalks and I didn&#8217;t speak up because I don&#8217;t sit or sleep on sidewalks.</em></p>
<p><em>Then they came for the Happy Meals and I did not speak up because I don&#8217;t eat happy meals.</em></p>
<p><em>Then they came for those who circumcise their sons and fortunately, there are plenty to speak up.</em></p>
<p>San Francisco is a favorite city of mine. I think I may have to reconsider.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/02/business/la-fi-happy-meals-20101103" target="_blank">Happy Meal ban</a> is dumb, but it doesn&#8217;t discriminate against a particular group. The circumcision ban would present a big problem for a lot of people. San Francisco &#8220;intactivists&#8221; are gathering the requisite signatures to place a circumcision ban on the ballot. If it gets on the ballot and gets enough votes, circumcision would be banned in San Francisco.<span id="more-3316"></span></p>
<p>Judaism and Islam require male circumcision.</p>
<p>The proposed law raises some very interesting constitutional issues. It is very hard to prove discrimination against a religion. So long as there is another purpose for the law, besides discrimination, the law is likely to be upheld and not in violation of the &#8220;Free Exercise&#8221; Clause. If the proponents of the ban can show that there is a legal interest that is being protected by the law then it will likely be upheld.</p>
<p>The 14th Amendment protects a parent&#8217;s rights to make decisions for their child without interference from the government. The court has found that there is a Fundamental Right to &#8220;direct a child&#8217;s upbringing&#8221;. The issue here would be if there is a compelling government interest in banning circumcision. I don&#8217;t think the proposed law could withstand this challenge. If the court would not find that circumcision is part of &#8220;the upbringing of a child&#8221;, then the law would have a chance.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on the legal analysis? Lawyers? Law Students? Others?</p>
<p>I can completely understand why someone who is not religious would not want to circumcise their son. I can even understand why they think it is wrong or inappropriate. However, for a person who is religious, their religion is their law and their life. The &#8220;intactivists&#8221; claim that religion is a choice and the baby cannot choose their religion when they are getting circumcised. I think that most children raised in a mildly religious environment with a basic appreciation for their traditions and practicing some of those traditions will be happy to continue in their tradition and would appreciate their parents&#8217; role in helping them be a faithful member of that religion, even if it means circumcision.</p>
<p>The health benefits and detriments are neglible as science has shown. Circumcision is about religion and not about ancient medicine.</p>
<p>As an aside, my father is a Mohel (traditional Jewish &#8220;circumciser&#8221;).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only thing this law would accomplish, even if passed, is that it would force Jews and Muslims who are compelled to circumcise their sons to either move out of San Francisco, or simply have the circumcision performed outside the city limits. Seems pretty silly to me&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="Bill of Rights" src="http://i1.wp.com/dl.dropbox.com/u/1448492/bill_of_rights.jpg?resize=299%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />Christine O&#8217;Donnell has certainly created quite a stir. While addressing a group of Law School students, O&#8217;Donnell asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Where in the Constitution is the separation of church and state?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The truth is that the separation of church in state is not in the Constitution, it has been interpreted from the establishment clause in the 1st Amendment which is the Bill of Rights. That&#8217;s a semantical difference because the Bill of Rights and the Constution carry the exact same weight. They, and the interpretations of them, are the absolute law of the land. So while, O&#8217;Donnell&#8217;s campaign manager can spin this anyway he wants:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Christine O’Donnell was not questioning the concept of separation of church and state as subsequently established by the courts. She simply made the point that the phrase appears nowhere in the Constitution.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="more-3118"></span>&#8230;clearly, that&#8217;s not what she meant. O&#8217;Donnell was surprised when she was quoted the text of the 1st Amendment as well.</p>
<p>This raises two interesting issues.</p>
<p>1) Should politicians be required to have a basic working knowledge of the Constitution? Federalism? Separation of Powers? Or maybe if we vote in ignorant people, it&#8217;s our problem?</p>
<p>To a Law Student, who is always reading mistakes that were corrected by higher courts (that&#8217;s basically what we read in Law School), it seems that ignorance of the Constitution and of Common Law lead to some of our greatest problems. States enact laws that are unconstitutional all the time. Lawmakers (i.e. senators and representatives) do not all have the basic knowledge one needs to make laws. It&#8217;s a problem. But whose problem is it? Should there be more regulation? Or is the &#8220;fix it later&#8221; system that we currently have, good enough?</p>
<p>2) As an observant Jew, it is familiar to see interpretations take on the status of absolute law. That is exactly how Jewish Law operates. Constitutional Law is similar to Jewish Law in that new laws are interpreted from its words and no distinction is made between &#8220;Original Text Law&#8221; and &#8220;Interpreted Law&#8221;. In Jewish Law there is no difference between &#8220;Original Text Law&#8221; and &#8220;Interpreted Law&#8221; either. Perhaps, O&#8217;Donnell is struggling with this nuanced understanding of interpretation.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe she really is ignorant&#8230;</p>

If you have not, here goes.</p>
<p>Today, a killer whale named Tilikum at Sea World Orlando killed a trainer. Yes. A whale. An animal that has no instinct to kill a human, killed a human, IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE! That was certainly more than the spectators bargained for&#8230;</p>
<p>You can read all about it all over the place, <span id="more-2170"></span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/us/25whale.html" target="_blank">try the NY Times article here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this horrible incident all day.</p>
<p>Because I am a human being I mourn the untimely loss of one of our own.</p>
<p>Because I am a Rabbi I thought about whether zoos have a place in Jewish law.</p>
<p>Because I am a Law Student, and working at the California Court of Appeals, I thought about the potential liabilities involved.</p>
<p>Because I am not a &#8220;fan&#8221; of zoos or animal exhibits, I continue to wonder &#8220;what&#8217;s the point?&#8221;. And that is what I am going to write about here.</p>
<p>Animals belong in the wild. You want to go see animals? Go visit them in their home town. Don&#8217;t bring them to my home town and cage them up so people can gawk at them. Sure, there is educational value in learning about animals, but is that sufficient cause to lock animals up in a place that somewhat resembles their natural habitat?</p>
<p>I know, I know, we need to learn about animals so that we can understand our planet and how we relate to the ecosystem and we need to protect animals that are losing their natural habitats etc. etc. etc&#8230;</p>
<p>We can do that all in other ways. We have the resources to study animals in their environment.</p>
<p>Zoos hearken back to a time when Man thought Himself invincible and the world to be at His mercy. I think we know better know. Man is part of an intricate universe. We can&#8217;t overstep our bounds.</p>
<p>Who in their right mind thinks that an orca that is accustomed to swimming miles on end day after day is comfortable in a big fish tank? It is a miracle they haven&#8217;t revolted yet! I feel terrible for the trainer. Not just because she was killed by a killer whale, but because she probably thought that the animal was her friend. She probably had developed feelings for the animal. Most trainers do. I have heard from many trainers that they &#8220;love&#8221; their animals. But the thing is, animals don&#8217;t love like people do. Animals don&#8217;t reason or use logic. They can be trained to suppress their instincts, but they can always revert to their natural behaviors. I feel bad for the trainer because she probably thought the killer whale would never harm her.</p>
<p>Maybe I just don&#8217;t enjoy seeing animals in a zoo enough to see the value, but it seems hard to justify in my eyes. The danger to humans is clear and I believe that animals belong in the wild.</p>
<p>In Jewish law, an animal does not have &#8220;rights&#8221;. However, a human has responsibilities toward animals. We are not permitted to abuse animals. We are not permitted to cause animals any pain or suffering. We are only permitted to hunt for food (by most authorities) and not for sport. In my view, zoos are sport. Caging animals so that we can have fun seems like an abuse of animals. And we have a responsibility to treat animals with respect and care.</p>
<p>I would much prefer to watch the <a href="http://bit.ly/9sjVHf" target="_blank">Planet Earth</a> series (<a href="http://bit.ly/9sjVHf" target="_blank">which you should DEFINITELY buy, click here</a>) at home, than see animals caged in a zoo.</p>
<p>Just think, another life would have been saved too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/knowledge-against-prison.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1983" title="jail prison" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/knowledge-against-prison.gif?resize=132%2C168" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Last semester at Law School I studied Criminal Law. Crime is ugly. It hurts the victims and negatively affects the criminal&#8217;s life forever. Families can be shattered and communities can be destroyed by crime.</p>
<p>The system we have today only looks at the criminal. The goal of our criminal justice system is to incapacitate criminals and punish them for their acts. Little systematic rehabilitation is offered to criminals and consequently there is a high rate of recidivism in our prisons. We hope that punishing criminals will deter them and future criminals from pursuing a life of crime. Unfortunately, crime persists and criminals continue to crop up.<span id="more-1982"></span></p>
<p>There is also research that shows that a criminal is hard wired psychologically with tendencies to commit crime as early as the age of five. It is very tough battle for the criminal justice system to fight when going head to head with ingrained psychological pathologies. It seems there is little hope for a system wide effort to change criminals into contributing members of society.</p>
<p>It is clear that our current system accomplishes one important goal. It maintains order. If not for the justice system chaos would rule the day as people with no care for right or wrong would be able to wreak havoc unfettered. The criminal justice system helps maintain order and some semblance of safety. It may not be a perfect system but in this regard it is the best we have.</p>
<p>While studying Criminal Law at Law School I also studied the <a href="http://www.lls.edu/programs/religiouslaw/adlerstein.html" target="_blank">Loyola Law School course on Jewish Law</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchok_Adlerstein" target="_blank">Rabbi Adlerstein</a>. The focus of the course was dual. On one hand we studied much of the substantive law on subjects such as helping  distressed motorist, finding lost objects, justifiable homicide and abortion, criminal procedure and many other interesting topics in Jewish Law. On the other hand we learned about a system of rules designed to prevent crime and to create a more perfect society. When Jewish Law was THE law it effectively deterred criminals and focused on the criminal making the victims whole again as opposed to retribution of the criminal. This contrasts sharply with the criminal justice system in western society.</p>
<p>This semester I am hoping to be taking the Restorative Justice Seminar at Loyola with Professor Wood. (I say hoping because it depends on some administrative decisions that are out of my control.) The Restorative Justice concept is similar in some ways to the Jewish Law concept. It focuses on the totality of the crime, not just the criminal and it hopes to help rehabilitate criminals at least in some capacity. I am looking forward to learning more about Restorative Justice (hopefully).</p>
<p>All this discussion about crime and if there is a system that can deter crime is very important. We all want a more productive society. Less crime means less resources spent on deterring and punishing crime. More importantly it give more people the opportunity to be productive members of society. Perhaps most importantly, there are no hurt victims.  Yet, much of it is theory as the system in place now is not changing dramatically any time soon.</p>
<p>However, I recently came across a self professed thief who changed his ways. This fellow stole thousands of dollars worth of various items for most of his life. This all began when he was about 5 years old. This is line with the research mentioned above. This fellow never got caught. He was never subject to the criminal justice system and yet, somehow, he turned it all around.</p>
<p>Can we learn from his story? Is there a system that can help criminals adjust their behavior? Does it require punishment?</p>
