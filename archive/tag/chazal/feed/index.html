				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night I hosted a screening of the Noah Movie followed by a discussion about the film. I loved it. We enjoyed great food, great company, and a great overall experience. But that&#8217;s not enough why I loved the event so much. I loved last night because I think the experience addressed a fundamental struggle to American Orthodox (and non-Orthodox) Judaism.</p>
<p>I view the film as a Modern Day Midrash.<span id="more-8927"></span> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/10/24/its-time-to-write-the-modern-midrash/vlcsnap-2014-03-13-14h40m55s25/" rel="attachment wp-att-8929"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8929" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/vlcsnap-2014-03-13-14h40m55s25.png?fit=600%2C600" alt="vlcsnap-2014-03-13-14h40m55s25" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Bible story is very brief and is missing tons of details. The text also invites many questions about the narrative and morality. Torah scholars and teachers have looked at Bible stories through the lens of their time, place, and personality to answer these questions, fill in gaps, and teach lessons based on the text. These interpretations, whether they appear in the Apocrypha, Talmudic literature, or Midrash compilations, are all a form of Midrash.</p>
<p>For most Orthodox Jews today, old Midrashic interpretations are special. They are given almost the same authority as halachic texts from the same era. They are the &#8220;true&#8221; interpretations of the texts. We have “objective” interpretations of the text and they are cobbled together into a loosely canonized version of Midrash. That’s why so many people assume that all Midrash is historically accurate and scientifically correct. We are led to believe that some Midrash is objectively true. Ironically, the authors of the old Midrash and many of the early Bible commentaries were not working under those assumptions. They acknowledged their subjectivity. Yet, today we teach an objective view of Midrashic interpretation.</p>
<p>This is reinforced by classic commentaries like Rashi because they seem to view the old Midrashic interpretations as the only ones that matter. Or rather, the ones they picked became the only ones that matter. Further, Rashi is our most prolific, more popular, and most studied Biblical commentator and he barely says anything of his own. Just about everything he writes, is found in earlier sources. We are implicitly being told that the only interpretations that matter are older than Rashi.</p>
<p>But if you read other commentaries and later Midrash texts you see that it&#8217;s not so simple. Some Medieval commentators argue with oft-quoted Midrashic interpretations for any number of reasons. We also have more recent Midrash collections that add details and lessons that seem to be new. Interestingly, some of these later Midrashic interpretations are granted legitimacy by contemporary Orthodox authorities, but the reason they are accepted is because they are assumed to be old Midrash that was lost or hidden until the later Midrash publicized it. In other words, the idea that a later Midrash was added by a later interpreter without an earlier source is so troubling that these interpretations are reinterpreted as having originated with the old Midrash.</p>
<p>At some point it became unacceptable or uncomfortable to write new Midrash. But I don’t believe this is the correct approach. I think it is hurting us severely in many ways. Old Midrash is bursting with lessons and ideas about morality and spirituality. Those ideas come from a particular time and place. Of course there is beauty and power to these interpretations and we should study them and teach them. But they are somewhat handicapped by their birthday. The intended audience of the Old Midrash might have included us Moderns, but it’s not a perfect fit. Often, the moral challenges or personal struggles in the old Midrash are foreign to us. It’s like an American reading about daily life in the African Bush. We can somewhat relate to it but it’s not our life.</p>
<p>One of the things I proposed a few weeks ago was that we address the spirit of law in Orthodox Judaism. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/09/10/cultivating-positive-orthodox-jewish-experiences/" target="_blank">We should be writing new Taamei HaMitzvot that speak to us</a>. Another phase of this effort is an attempt to create Modern Midrash. We should be reading the stories of the Bible and thinking about them in a new and fresh way. What does the story say to me, today, with my challenges, and with my struggles? We would never pass our questions and answers off as objective truth. But truth is not objective when it comes to interpretation. Different people can see different things in the same source material. They both can be true interpretations even if they are not both historically true. There is room for subjectivity in all interpretation of literature, art, music, or really anything that is not science or explicit Divine Revelation. Judaism is art, not science.</p>
<p>Darren Aronofsky, the producer of Noah, has <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/31/movie-review-noah-a-very-jewish-retelling/" target="_blank">written a Modern Midrash</a>. Noah asks many of the same questions as the old Midrash and actually provides many of the same answers &#8211; with a twist. He also asks new questions and offers new answers that are often based on old ideas. It’s literally just like a Midrash. Some of his answers and ideas are odd or uncomfortable and that’s okay. He’s giving us a new way to think about an old story that stays true to ideas about the story that are deeply rooted in our tradition. When one watches Noah within this context, it&#8217;s not just a movie, it becomes a 2 hour and 20 minute Torah class. It invites us to think and criticize and discuss and learn about the Noah story from our modern perspective. And it does so spectacularly.</p>
<p>We need more Modern Midrash. I am certain that the struggles of our generation and the issues we face can be addressed by Torah. But we don’t have to look at Torah exclusively through the glasses of our great great great grandparents. We can look at Torah through our own eyes and see things from our own perspective. Like Aronofsky’s Noah, we make no claims of objectivity or historical truth. But the lessons and ideas can be eternal despite acknowledging their subjectivity.</p>
<p>American Orthodox Judaism faces many great challenges. I think Modern Midrash is part of the solution. It is empowering. It gives us credit for being well educated and steeped in Torah. It allows for creativity and expression. It speaks our language. It makes Biblical stories and their interpretations relevant. It will provide great thinkers an opportunity to see answers to our existential and religious questions in Torah. It will be the voice of our contemporary struggles and triumphs. It changes everything. The process and its results will help create new positive Jewish experiences for a new generation.</p>
<p>So join me in this journey. Let’s write the Modern Midrash together. The next few months of Torah readings are Biblical narratives. The soil is lush and fertile. Let’s build something new out of something old. I believe it is our duty and I believe that we will be successful. If we do succeed, I am confident that we will hear the echoes of the Voice that spoke to our forefathers. That Voice will help us discover our own path to a Jewish life that is full of meaning, religiously commitment, and spiritual ecstasy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several readers contacted me with an important question that was left unanswered in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/02/24/life-is-in-its-struggles-dealing-with-the-tough-questions/">Life is in its Struggles: Dealing With the Tough Questions</a>. The basic question is quite simple really.</p>
<p><em>If it is true that Chazal may have erred in matters of science or history or medicine, why should I listen to the laws of rabbis if they made mistakes?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been asked this question a lot. The sort of people who ask this question range from Haredi Jews to atheist Jews. Everyone asks this question. It is a question that cuts to the core of contemporary Judaism and requires our attention.<span id="more-8232"></span></p>
<p>There is a flippant deflection that works in short comment threads or casual conversation. That is, everyone agrees that Chazal made some mistakes. We have conclusions in the Talmud that prove various rabbinic opinions wrong. We have examples of rabbinic thinking that is literally impossible to reconcile with reality. Almost every normal Orthodox Jew is forced to acknowledge that Chazal were not perfect or infallible. Thus, the question is not any more a question on my view than it is a question on every view.<a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hukum_berkas.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8234" alt="hukum_berkas" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/hukum_berkas.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But this is a dodge. It reflects the question back onto the asker without offering a shred of hope for an answer. This very important question deserves a good answer. I believe the best answer to this question is found in its assumptions. Let&#8217;s unpack the question and see what we can discover.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;If it is true that the rabbis may have erred in matters of science or history or medicine&#8221;</em> is a completely fair way to set up the problem. I do express the view that Chazal may have erred in these matters. I have stated that for this reason it does not bother me when Chazal say things that contradict science or common sense. They were working with what they had and this was their best attempt. But today we know more than Chazal when it comes to the natural sciences. This is obvious and not troubling at all.</p>
<p>The next part of the question asks why we should listen to rabbis who made mistakes. In other words, if they were wrong about women or astronomy, maybe they were wrong about Jewish law too! In order to ask this question, a huge assumption is being made. Eliminating this assumption is the real answer to the question.</p>
<p>We are not required to listen to Chazal because of some sort of doctrine of infallibility. We do not follow the teachings and rulings of Chazal because the social reasons for their decisions are eternal and inflexible. Chazal do not derive their authority from the perfection of their logic or reasoning. The reason we adhere to the religious conclusions of Chazal is a matter of authority. Chazal have religious authority to set and determine religious law. There are limits to this authority. Chazal could not do whatever they dreamt up on a whim. Their authority was governed by specific rules and boundaries. But in the areas that Chazal did indeed possess authority, we are obligated to follow their rulings. We follow their rulings regardless of the social conditions and scientific understandings that may have influenced their opinions. Those are not relevant to their authority. Chazal had religious authority that was not dependent on explaining their rationale or providing sophisticated justifications. Their authority applied no matter the circumstances.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar to the American law that prohibits driving faster than posted speeds. The reason for those laws is ostensibly safety of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. If scientists determined that it was actually no safer to drive 35 MPH in a posted residential zone than it would be to drive 42 MPH in the same zone, the law would still apply. You wouldn&#8217;t be able to drive 42 and argue in court that the science demonstrates that the law&#8217;s reasoning is incorrect and therefore it should no longer apply. It is completely irrelevant. We are all bound by the law because the law is the law no matter what. It is an issue of authority. The government has the authority to make laws. There may be some reasoning for the law, but the law applies even if the reasoning does not apply.</p>
<p>This is the difference between law and logic. If there is legal authority, the law is binding. If a law is illogical, it is still binding. But when arguing matters of debate and rhetoric, logic wins the day. If one&#8217;s position has no logical basis, one will lose the argument. Logic and law operate in different spheres.</p>
<p>Chazal&#8217;s authority is legal not logical. They have the authority to set religious laws and their logic is usually not relevant at all. If Chazal made a rule about women based on their possibly flawed understanding of women&#8217;s anatomy, the law would still apply. It&#8217;s a legal argument, not a logical argument.</p>
<p>Clearly a distinction could be made between areas that Chazal exempted women and areas Chazal made prohibitions. Also, when Chazal make a law and say it is because of X, then it may be permissible to undermine the law if X is disproved or incorrect in a particular instance.</p>
<p>The opening question is based on a flawed assumption. Some people think that Chazal had magical powers and were able to divine the will of God through these powers. If this is true, then everything they said would be expected to reflect God&#8217;s truth. Demonstrating any errors of logic or science in that kind of system undercuts the whole thing. The entire authority of the rabbis in that version of understanding is based upon infallibility. If it can be shown that they were not infallible, the authority is gone. This kind of thinking is far too common. It shows up on the extreme fundamentalist side of the religious spectrum as well as the extreme to the non-fundamentalist side. The question crosses typical lines, but the assumption that is required to ask this question may be incorrect.</p>
<p>There are two unanswered questions that are raised by this answer. First, where did Chazal get their authority? And second, what are the parameters and limitations of this authority?</p>
<p>Both of these are good, answerable questions. I have a lengthy essay that handles these questions and I hope to have that published somewhere, someday. In the meantime, it should be sufficient to make the basic distinction between legal authority and legal reasoning. The errors we find in Chazal are of no legal consequence and therefore we can be comfortable saying that Chazal made mistakes without undermining their legal and ritualistic teachings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the works of Chazal, the Geonim, the Rishonim, and the Achronim, we encounter giants of Torah knowledge, spirit masters of the soul, and gladiators of moral struggle. Perhaps this is why it strikes us as so odd that some of the statements of these greats seem so offensive to us. In particular, there are quite a few statements about women that defy our modern understanding of biology and female potential.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are many positive comments in the Talmud and beyond about women. However, when it comes to a woman&#8217;s cognitive abilities, several rabbis in the Talmud take an arcane approach. Famously, it is said that women have a thin capacity for &#8220;daat&#8221; and that anyone who teaches women Torah is teaching licentiousness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/eliyahu.fink/posts/10102167463562475?stream_ref=10" target="_blank">Another possible example</a> is sourced in last week&#8217;s parsha. Rabbi Eliezer is quoted as saying that &#8220;women have only one area of wisdom, the spindle.&#8221; The Jerusalem Talmud compounds this statement by including his subsequent comment to his son that &#8220;it&#8217;s better for Torah to burn than to teach Torah to a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to reinterpret the offensive statements through a variety of methods.<span id="more-8151"></span> Not every statement can be reinterpreted, but I think a reinterpretation has been offered for every one of these statements. We are extremely uncomfortable with taking these statements literally. This is for two separate reasons. First, we don&#8217;t want to be restricted by the consequences of these statements. We want to teach Torah to our daughters. If we take these statements literally, teaching our daughters Torah is forbidden. Second, we simply don&#8217;t agree with the literal interpretations of these statements. We know that women are actually as smart as men. We know that women can do a lot of things that these statements seem to imply they are incapable of doing. So we reinterpret the statements in order that our modern understanding of women is not at odds with the rabbinic understanding of women in Late Antiquity through the Age of Enlightenment.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/struggle-with-life.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8155" alt="struggle-with-life" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/struggle-with-life.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>These offensive statements do not bother me at all. Not even a tiny bit. It&#8217;s not because I agree with the statements. It&#8217;s also not because I think the statements were really hidden messages of praise toward women.</p>
<p>The reason these statements do not bother me at all is because when these statements were stated, no one thought they were offensive. It is only in the last 100 years that we have come to accept, in most parts of the world, that these ideas are incorrect. Just 101 years ago, Sir Almroth E. Wright MD <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5183/pg5183.txt" target="_blank">wrote the following</a> argument against women&#8217;s suffrage:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;[&#8230;]the woman suffragist takes it as a matter of course that she would herself be able to construct a system of workable laws. In point of fact, the framing of a really useful law is a question of divining something which will apply to an infinite number of different cases and individuals. It is an intellectual feat on a par with the framing of a great generalisation. And would woman&#8211;that being of such short sight, whose mind is always so taken up with whatever instances lie nearest to her&#8211;be capable of framing anything that could pass muster as a great generalization?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Should it surprise us that rabbis living 2000 years ago agreed with this idea? Of course not. Galen said 2200 years ago that &#8220;in all respects,&#8221; less perfect than man. This was authoritative science in the era of Chazal. It was their reality.</p>
<p>I think the offensive statements are in fact offensive. I think they were meant the way they were recorded. I think they reflect the way men thought about women until very recently. Yet, none of this bothers me because I am comfortable holding Chazal to the standard of their milieu. They lived in a world where this was commonly held belief and so there is no crime in their acquiescence to these beliefs.</p>
<p>Further, awareness of the historical context makes reinterpretation even more difficult to accept. In order to suggest a liberal or progressive interpretation of a statement that is offensive in its simplest reading, the following assumptions are required. A) We must say that the author of the statement meant to say something positive about women. B) The author chose to make this positive statement using language that on its face sounds offensive. C) The simplest interpretation of the statement is that it was offensive. D) Everyone at the time the statement was made would have read it as offensive and agreed with the statement. E) Then one day, we starting being nicer to women and we realized that the original statement that sounded so offensive really had a hidden meaning that was positive all along. F) Further, all the great Torah scholars who read the statement literally for the last 2000 years and built religious laws and practices based on this literal interpretation mistakenly believed the statement was literal but it was really some sort of metaphor or idiom that we only figured out very recently. (You see, how in order to make one rabbi look better, we make hundreds look worse, but I digress.) This logical structure seems quite farfetched and I see no reason or benefit to invoking it in these situations.</p>
<p>Instead, let&#8217;s own it. Yes. Our rabbis understood women differently than we do today. That&#8217;s okay. They understood all social and scientific conditions as they were in their day and so do we. It&#8217;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>This all leads to a more pressing question that I was asked in several different ways and by several different people during two separate discussions of these ideas over the weekend.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Why talk about this? Isn&#8217;t there better stuff to discuss? Isn&#8217;t there a risk that people will see this stuff and it will cause them to be turned off from Judaism? Don&#8217;t we prefer that these things be broached in a safe, quiet place and not in public?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This is a valid question. I have two things to say about this issue and this is the real reason I am writing this article. Both are really two sides of the same coin. (Of course there are other reasons to discuss these issues as well.)</p>
<p><strong>Life is in its struggles</strong>. If we are not struggling, we are not growing. If we are not growing, we are dying. People think that it&#8217;s best to avoid struggles. They says we can build ourselves up by focusing on the things that provide no resistance. They claim that life is happier when we are comfortable. I strongly disagree. Life does not happen where things are easy. Life is in its struggles.</p>
<p>There is great value in engaging in struggles. That is how we grow. When I see something that makes me struggle or that might cause others to struggle, I see an opportunity. It&#8217;s a chance to get into the trenches and do some work. We will grow from the struggle. This is true even if we don&#8217;t come to a happy resolution. The act of struggle is in itself a form of growth.</p>
<p>When we see a selection in the Talmud that pushes our buttons, we should not push aside our question and go to our happy place. We should seize the opportunity to grapple with our question. It&#8217;s a gift and we should treasure it accordingly.</p>
<p>Which leads to the second point. I have found that the overwhelming complaint of people who leave Orthodox Judaism (or even those who are disenchanted but stay) is that legitimate questions were dismissed or ignored. Note, their complaint is not that their legitimate questions were unanswered. Their complaint is that the questions were not acknowledged.</p>
<p>Our knee jerk response to tough questions is to go to our place of safety where there are no questions. Call it the Abie Rotenberg Zone. I love Abie and his music, but to me his songs with English lyrics are mostly representative of a place where things are simple. The struggles are superficial. Answers are readily available and sometimes to simplistic. To the genuine asker of the question it can seem dismissive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more important to acknowledge that the question is indeed a tough nut to crack than it is to wave a hand and give a dismissive &#8220;answer&#8221;. It is better to enter into the fray and struggle even without a resolution than it is to ignore the struggle. When we acknowledge the struggle we are saying &#8220;you are not alone.&#8221; &#8220;We are struggling together with you.&#8221; The feeling of knowing that we not alone and that we can engage in this struggle together is so empowering. It can literally be life saving.</p>
<p>So when I see something that I have struggled with at some point, or that someone else has told me they struggled with at a certain point, or that I am struggling with right now, I think it is much better to address it than to ignore it. I prefer to engage in that struggle or at least provide a place for others to engage in that struggle. That is so much more valuable than the alternatives. Not only is not destructive, it is empowering.</p>
<p>I think the Orthodox Jewish community needs to work on this particular idea. We have an aversion to conflict and we have a fear of engaging in the struggle. I think we need to embrace the challenges we encounter in our Jewish journey. We will grow from the ensuing struggle and by acknowledging the struggle we will validate its place in our discourse providing ourselves and others the comfort in knowing that we are struggling together. And together we will persevere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little while ago, I commented somewhere on Facebook (I think it was a Joshie Berger rant) that orthodox Jews don&#8217;t <em>really</em> believe that humans can&#8217;t live past 120 years old. Frum people know that humans can live past 120. So it&#8217;s not a challenge to orthodox Jewish faith that in recorded history, especially recently, humans have outpaced the 120 mark on several occasions.</p>
<p>I believe the popular source for the belief that 120 is the age limit for humans is a combination of this verse in Parshas Breishis <em>&#8220;And the LORD said: &#8216;My spirit shall not abide in man for ever, for that he also is flesh; therefore shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.&#8221;</em> (6:3) and the fact that Moses lived to 120 as well.<span id="more-7681"></span></p>
<p>However, Rashi quotes the midrashic interpretation that the verse as referring to the years that God waits before punishing mankind. The Ibn Ezra explicitly rejects the opinion that people cannot live past 120 years that is based on this verse as well.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the Torah Temimah does this and more. He quotes the Jerusalam Talmud in Nazir that asks how it&#8217;s possible for people to only live to 120 if Adam lived to almost 1000?! The Talmud answer that the verse is referring to decomposition. The bones of a person decompose after 120 years. (7:2)<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/bones.pdf"><br />
</a><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7684" alt="A-previous-burial-was-pushed-out-of-the-way-to-make-way-for-this-womans-skeleton.-There-were-two-football-field-size-cemeteries-found-on-this-site-where-250-skeletons-were-found.-Mike-Hettwer-960x617" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/A-previous-burial-was-pushed-out-of-the-way-to-make-way-for-this-womans-skeleton.-There-were-two-football-field-size-cemeteries-found-on-this-site-where-250-skeletons-were-found.-Mike-Hettwer-960x617.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The Torah Temimah notes that the Talmud is bothered by the plain fact that the verse is contradicted by people who lived longer than 120 years and even other Torah verses that describe longer lifetimes. So the Talmud answers that the verse is not to be taken literally and is instead referring to decomposition.</p>
<p>But this is of little help. The Torah Temimah correctly points out that there are sources in our tradition of bones that lasted longer than 120 post mortem like the bones of Joseph. He also cites secular experts who have found old bones of people known to have died more than 120 years prior to their discovery. By the way, decomposition takes between 10-75 years depending on soil conditions according to my research.</p>
<p>So the Torah Temimah is forced to say that the Talmud is making a general statement for which there are more exceptions that situations where the rule applies. It cannot even be talking about every bone in a person&#8217;s body because the Talmud talks about the bone in our spine that never decomposes and is the place from where we will regenerate in the times of the Messiah. Therefore, the Jerusalem Talmud must be speaking in vague terms and is not meant to be taken as a definitive, universal statement.</p>
<p>I find this Torah Temimah fascinating. Evidence from the Torah and science can disprove the idea that people drop dead if they reach 120. So we are easily able to dismiss that verse as literally true. But the solution suffers from the same flaws as the question. There are fossils that are millions of years old. And not just the bone that &#8220;doesn&#8217;t decompose.&#8221; There are many more skeletons that have completely decomposed. Even that bone from the spine that is not supposed to decompose decomposes. These are demonstrable facts.</p>
<p>So now we have two options. We can say that the Torah Temimah and his interpretation of the Talmud are correct and our eyes deceived us or we can say he erred. The interesting thing is that I think we can be certain which path the Torah Temimah would choose. He would choose the latter. That is how he arrived at his position in the first place!</p>
<p>There is nothing frummer about the first option. Especially when we are using it to &#8220;help&#8221; an authority that chose the second option time and time again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no different when we talk abuot Chazal. They also chose the second choice whenever they found out they made a mistake. It&#8217;s not frummer to choose option one to &#8220;help&#8221; Chazal when they themselves chose the second option in various places.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6936" alt="baby" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/baby.png?resize=300%2C294" data-recalc-dims="1" />The beginning of Parshas Tazria instructs the Jewish people on commandments that relate to matters of childbirth. One law sates that a woman who gives birth is ritually impure for seven days if she bears a son and fourteen days if she bears a daughter.</p>
<p>The Torah does not tell us why there is a difference between the days of ritual impurity for a son and a daughter. Naturally, this led our great rabbis to speculate and provide their own insights into these laws. Inevitably these commentaries will reflect the social and scientific norms of their milieu.</p>
<p>It is fascinating to track the development of these ideas.</p>
<p>Two general categories of interpretations are given to explain the discrepancy between the days of impurity for a son and a daughter. One category goes the social route and the other goes the medical route.<span id="more-6935"></span></p>
<p>The social route generally considers sons to be a great blessing and daughters to be a bit of a curse. Rabbi Josh Waxman has a great example of one medieval commentator who takes this tack (see: <a href="http://parsha.blogspot.com/2013/04/guys-rule-in-tazria.html">Guys rule in Tazria</a>). One can see hints of this sort of thinking in the Talmud as well. Boys earned money for the family while girls were a financial strain on the ancient family. Thus, it follows that there would be a longer period of ritual impurity for a daughter because it was less joyous. I&#8217;m not sure how this actually works logically, but you do see this line of thinking.</p>
<p>The medical route considers the birth of a son to be easier or to expel less blood or that girls are born &#8220;cooler&#8221; so the mother needs longer to heal because coolness causes illness or that boys are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 40 days and girls are &#8220;formed&#8221; after 80 days. These are ideas found in the Rishonim to explain the double waiting time for a daughter.</p>
<p>None of these reasons would satisfy the modern reader of the Chumash. No matter how &#8220;frum&#8221; one may be, these explanations don&#8217;t work anymore. Either because girls no longer cost more than boys, or because daughters are not considered a curse. Further, we know that the medicine found in these interpretations is incorrect as well.</p>
<p>Artscroll, which is by and large very traditionalist in their interpretations, shies away from these ancient commentaries as well. They are almost forced to pluck a beautiful idea from a very unlikely source to give some sort of explanation here. Artscroll quotes R&#8217; Dovid Tzvi Hoffman (late 19th century) who says that really the appropriate amount of days would be fourteen days. But since we want the mother of the child to attend the Bris Milah the Torah subtracts some time from the ritual impurity and knocks it down to seven days so that she will be able to participate in her son&#8217;s entering of the covenant.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Hoffman&#8217;s answer is lovely. But it is not found in earlier commentaries. The reason for that is because up until recently, the other interpretations were plausible. Once those interpretations became anachronistic, another interpretation was needed. R&#8217; Hoffman provides one such interpretation. Artscroll is written for 21st century Jews. They wisely choose the newer, more modern interpretation for their publication.</p>
<p>The beginning of the parsha also features some ancient science on conception. The verse says that a &#8220;woman who seeds a seed a births a son.&#8221; The implication is that the son is born because because the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221;. The Talmud explains that when the woman &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a son. When the man &#8220;seeds&#8221; first the child is a daughter. Ramban explains that the woman&#8217;s blood meets the man&#8217;s semen and they are the two ingredients that form the child. Whichever is &#8220;first&#8221; determines the gender. With this (wrong) medical explanation, the verse makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Ramban also brings the Greek version of conception which is different and has nothing to do with who is first. So he then explains how the verse is rendered if one holds like the Greeks! Ramban says that the word simply means seed in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>What are we to make of all this?</p>
<p>First of all, we see several examples of interpretations from ancient times that no longer work today. We are forced to abandon these commentaries and seek out newer commentaries. More importantly, it means that the ancient commentaries were based on conventional wisdom of their times. They did the best they could with what they had available to them. But their commentaries were not infallible. Particularly in areas of matters that are flux we cannot avoid the conclusion that they made mistakes and that their science or social conventions were not Divine.</p>
<p>More importantly, I think we see that even Ramban himself wasn&#8217;t so sure that Chazal were right about conception. He quotes the Greeks and gives a less elegant interpretation of the verse to reconcile their view. What does this mean? It means that when science buttresses up against the words of a verse, we are forced to reconcile the verse using creative interpretations. That must be allowed. After all the Ramban did just that. Today we are faced with similar challenges. Sometimes the old, simpler interpretations no longer work. What would Ramban do? He would reinterpret. But who among us has the shoulders of Ramban? Anyone? No one?</p>
<p>It is possible that the next Ramban is in our midst today. But with our somewhat stifling manner of Chumash study which hardly allows for innovation and reinterpretation, how will our Ramban ever show himself? Or perhaps she is a she? Who knows? One thing is clear, we don&#8217;t learn or teach Chumash the same way our ancestors learned Chumash. Instead we teach Chumash <em>the way our ancestors taught it.</em> I think we can do better.</p>

Neither are bombshells from the Torah Temimah, but they are still worth noting.</p>
<p><b>I. Science and Chazal</b></p>
<p><em>&#8220;These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.&#8221;</em> (Genesis 46:15)</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>R. Isaac citing R. Ammi stated: If the woman emits her semen first she bears a male child; if the man emits his semen first she bears a female child; for it is said, If a woman emits semen and bear a man-child.</em>&#8221; (Babylonian Talmud Nida 31A, translation Soncino)</p>
<p>The Talmud offers the verse from Vayigash as support for this statement. The idea is that the verse connects the sons to Leah and the daughter to Yaakov (thanks commenter Benny).</p>
<p>Now obviously, this is scientifically incorrect. There are several ways to deal with this kind of problem. Some will say Chazal were correct and science is incorrect. Others will say science is correct and Chazal are wrong. Others will say that the Talmud is speaking in metaphors, or mysticism, or some other non-literal interpretation.</p>
<p>It seems that the Torah Temimah is unaware that the science in this Talmudic statement was wrong, but he provides important insight nonetheless.<span id="more-6668"></span></p>
<p>If one were to try to say that Chazal were wrong about science in this instance, one might also need to say that the Torah was wrong. After all, Chazal are apparently gleaning this insight from the words in the Torah. While it is a matter of controversy to say Chazal were wrong about science, it is a matter of heresy to say the Torah is &#8220;wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Says the Torah Temimah (translation my own): <em>It seems obvious that substance of this idea was known to Chazal from the science [of their day] that everything goes according to the last force, and therefore if the man seeds first his force ends earlier and the embryo will follow the force of the end which is her seed and therefore the child will be female and vice versa. But only as a hint and sign did they rely on this verse. </em>Then the Torah Temimah proves from another Talmudic statement that this verse is not really a proof per se.</p>
<p>With this, the Torah Temimah has opened the door for one to say that Chazal were obviously basing their statement on contemporary science as opposed to some revealed wisdom and they were simply using the verse as a way of hinting toward their accepted wisdom. While this remains a matter of controversy in orthodox Jewish circles, it&#8217;s apparent that many great scholars held this way, including the Torah Temimah.</p>
<p><strong>II. An Important R&#8217;osh</strong></p>
<p>Chazal famously say that Yocheved was born between the walls of Egypt. They say this to explain a problem in the text. That is, the verse says that 70 people went with Yaakov to Egypt. The problem is that if you count the people mentioned in the Torah, it&#8217;s only 69 people and the Torah doesn&#8217;t mention her name because she was only a fetus. The Talmud even provides some textual support for this interpretation. The verse merely says that Yocheved was <em>born </em>in Egypt (Numbers 26:59), so we can infer that she was not conceived in Egypt.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah alerts us to a comment of the R&#8221;osh (Rabeinu Asher) at the end of Mesechta Pesachim §40. Some of the rishonim are bothered by the fact that the Torah says that we should count 50 days from Pesach to Shavuos and a different verse says to count seven complete weeks (49 days). The R&#8221;osh quotes some weak answers to this question and then drops the bomb. Says the R&#8221;osh: <i>There is no question here because the way of Scripture is when it gets to a round number minus one, Scripture uses the round number and it ignores the lower number. Similarly, we find the count of Yaakov&#8217;s family to be 70 (and another example).</i></p>
<p>This is huge. It is presumed by almost every serious orthodox Jew and most of the commentaries that every word in the Torah is absolutely precise and true. The R&#8221;osh obviously would agree. However, he has opened a door here. He is saying that the Torah is sometimes imprecise &#8211; specifically with regard to numbers. Would this also apply to a number like 600,000? Maybe. Maybe not. Is this an extension of <em>dibra Torah kilshon bnei adam? </em>Maybe.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah asks several good questions to poke holes in this R&#8221;osh. The gist of his attack is that Chazal and the Rishonim all took the numbers in the Torah to be precise so how could the R&#8221;osh disagree? So it&#8217;s unclear if the Torah Temimah likes this R&#8221;osh or not. But I like it either way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/furnace-fire.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6606" title="furnace-fire" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/furnace-fire.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In Parshas Vayeshev we read the story of Tamar and Yehuda. Tamar is suspected of being harlot and following her conviction, she is sentenced to death by burning. Instead of exonerating herself by outing Yehuda, she accepts her fate and merely produces some evidence that shows Yehuda surreptitiously that he was the one who was with her.</p>
<p>The Talmud says that this teaches us that it is better to be burned alive in a fiery furnace than to embarrass one&#8217;s friend in public.</p>
<p>Tosafos ask the obvious question: If one must die in a fiery furnace rather than embarrass one&#8217;s friend, it should be included with the three cardinal sins of Judaism for which a Jew is required to give up one&#8217;s life? Those are murder, adultery, and idol worship. If embarrassing a friend must be avoided at the cost of death &#8211; it is equal to those three! Why is it omitted from the list?</p>
<p>Tosafos answer that only things that are explicit in the Torah are included in the list.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah infers that Tosafos mean that one is in fact required to give up one&#8217;s life to spare a friend embarrassment. Meaning that halachically there is no<em> </em>leeway. One must give up one&#8217;s life in order that one&#8217;s friend not be embarrassed.</p>
<p>This does not make the Torah Temimah happy.<span id="more-6604"></span> He says &#8220;if not for their words I think&#8230;&#8221; which is rabbinic code for &#8220;I very respectfully disagree&#8221;. Instead the Torah Temimah says (translation mine) that it is clear that one cannot include embarrassing a friend in the list of three cardinal sins. Rather he says that the Talmud was teaching <em>mussar</em> and good etiquette. One who does not heed the advice of the rabbis of the Talmud is not a called a <em>rasha,</em> rather he is just a person with bad character. Whereas with the three cardinal sins, the law actually requires one to martyr oneself rather than sin. One who violates one of those sins is a <em>rasha</em> and it is as if he violated the basic tenets of faith.</p>
<p>I think the significant thing here is not so much that the Torah Temimah has a different answer than Tosafos. The bomb here is that the Torah Temimah is willing to tame an extreme statement of Chazal and call it <em>mussar </em>instead of taking it literally. Tosafos did not do that. Many charedim today do not do that. But the Torah Temimah was willing to reinterpret an extreme statement of Chazal and say it was not halachic, rather it was a sermonic point that was designed to urge people to act properly without setting actual parameters of legal ramifications.</p>
<p>Very interesting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SPA-SPAGLOBELOGO.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-5505 alignleft" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SPA-SPAGLOBELOGO.gif?resize=252%2C252" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A lot of the political discourse in American and in Europe revolves around economic models. The bold faced names in the discussion are capitalism and socialism. To be fair, no matter what, the United States will have a hybrid version because we will never get to a place where the system is completely capitalistic without taxation and social programs for the poor nor will we ever have a system of 100% taxation and governmental distribution of wealth.</p>
<p>In America, we are somewhere in the middle. Which is why I find it humorous when people call President Obama a socialist or Romney is touted as a true capitalist. It makes for good sound bites but the truth is that they are fairly close to one another economically. They might be on opposite extremes on the center. But they are not on opposite extremes of the spectrum the way Ayn Rand and Karl Marx are.</p>
<p>One fun argument is what the Bible has to say about these contemporary economic systems. Pretty much any view can be shoehorned into some passage from the Bible. So it is not a strong argument when one invokes scripture seeing as it so open to interpretation. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/02/03/wwjd/">WWJD?</a>)</p>
<p>However, Jewish Law does not follow the literal translation of scripture.<span id="more-5504"></span> Instead, Jewish Law follows the interpretations and codifications of the rabbis of the Mishnaic period and the analysis and expansion of those laws during the Talmudic period. These are &#8220;The Rabbis&#8221; that are referred to when people say things like &#8220;the rabbis said&#8230;&#8221;. In Hebrew they are known by their Hebrew acronym, Chazal.</p>
<p>The thing with Chazal is that they actually enacted specific legislation and we know the specific rules that they enforced. They are written in black and white in the Talmud. At <a href="http://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/social-legislation-in-the-talmud-isidore-epstein/" target="_blank">Kavvanah Blog</a> Rabbi Isidore Epstein&#8217;s introductory essay to the Talmud was posted and among many other fascinating issues, the essay addresses this particular point.</p>
<p>Rabbi Epstein enumerates dozens of regulatory laws in the Talmud. These are laws that were enacted and enforced by Chazal in a governmental capacity. Anyone who has studied the Talmud is familiar with many of these laws. But to see them rattled off one by one and analyzed through the lens of a 20th century scholar is very eye opening.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of Jewish Laws:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guarantee of public trees from which anyone could pluck</li>
<li>Highly regulated weights and measures</li>
<li>Agencies that regulated quality control of food and other goods</li>
<li>Common rights on real property that was owned</li>
<li>Price control over the sale of chattel</li>
<li>Rights for workers, including going beyond the letter of the law for their benefit</li>
<li>Protection of tenants</li>
<li>Competitive practices when there was no need for additional</li>
<li>Charity taxes that were distributed to the poor</li>
</ul>
<p>This short list does not do it justice. I think it impossible to read the essay and not draw the conclusion that Chazal endorsed a pretty severe form of socialism. That is not to say that they would endorse the same system for the United States of America in 2012. But it is to say, that the most traditional form of economic policy in orthodox Judaism is pretty close to socialism.</p>
<p>I do note that there were protective policies in place that were designed to prevent over-reliance on the social benefits of Rabbinic Judaism and some policies were skewed more to the side of capitalism. However, it is almost impossible to find ideas like <em>caveat emptor</em> or &#8220;the marketplace will decide what is fair or moral&#8221; in their system of commerce.</p>
<p>At the very least, the essay shows that many aspects of a social economy were considered moral and preferable to Chazal.</p>
<p>The essay is a must-read for its economic theory as well as its broader implications that are discussed more fully on Kavvanah. I cannot recommend reading the essay enough.</p>
