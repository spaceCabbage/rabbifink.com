				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meditation was once an oddity reserved for spiritual extremists. Today, meditation is as American as apple pie.</p>
<p>There are many good reasons to do meditation. The NY Times enumerates several of the benefits that have been demonstrated by science. Improved leadership and productivity can be attributed to meditation.</p>
<p>Meditation has a place in Judaism as well. Many great Jewish thinkers have described Jewish prayer as a form of meditation. The prophets of yore achieved their heightened spiritual state after intense meditation. There are pious chasidic men (and maybe some women) who meditate alone in the Jerusalem Forest on a regular basis. For us, meditation is a word to describe an activity whose end is to achieve some state of nirvana. It could even be argued that making blessings before eating food or enjoying any other physical pleasure is a variation of mindfulness.<span id="more-7348"></span></p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-7349 alignright" alt="meditation-6" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/meditation-6-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The NY Times reports that there is a reason that Buddha favored meditation. Buddha&#8217;s teachings were to end suffering. Meditation was intended to serve as a way of freeing one&#8217;s mind of the negative thoughts we have about others. The idea was to bring people together through the heightened state of awareness.</p>
<p>This is a lofty claim and it was put to the test by the author of the NY Times article, profesor of psychology Dr. David DeSteno. He and his lab conducted controlled experiments to determine if meditation had an impact on empathy and compassion.</p>
<p>The results? Incredibly, or maybe not, meditation actually helped a significant portion of test subjects feel empathetic. It works!</p>
<p>DeSteno concludes that while the fringe benefits are great, when one meditates one should be mindful of its original purpose. Hopefully if we can channel that power we can alleviate the pain of division and hate.</p>
<p>I can think of no message more appropriate for Rosh Chodesh Av. This time of year we are exhorted to work on our interpersonal skills. Perhaps it would be wise to spend some time in meditation to give ourselves an assist on this seasonal challenge.</p>
<p>The article also got me thinking about doing Mitzvos to reap the social benefits of the act or even to reap an alternative benefit that was certainly unintended. Sometimes people lament the new-agey interpretations of Mitzvos and modern understandings of their social benefits. True, it can feel uncomfortable, but I think it&#8217;s noteworthy that we find similar hand wringing with regard to meditation. DeSteno is a bit uncomfortable with using meditation to get ahead instead of using it to unite. I think we can relate to that.</p>
<p>Finally, one can imagine how vindicated followers of Buddha must feel. As orthodox Jews, we feel the same way some our traditions and teachings are corroborated by modern discoveries. I know I love when that happens, so I am sure the study mentioned in this article will bring similar feelings of euphoria to students of Buddha.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6707" alt="513723" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/513723-261x300.jpg" width="261" height="300" /></a>I planned this post for a little while, and it dovetails perfectly in the wake of yesterday&#8217;s post about the Op-Ed by Rabbi Sacks (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/25/a-small-addition-to-rabbi-sacks-beautiful-article-in-the-ny-times/">A Small Addition to Rabbi Sacks’ Beautiful Article in the NY Times</a>).</em></p>
<p>The best book I read this year was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists: A Non-believer&#8217;s Guide to the Uses of Religion</a> by Alain de Botton. The author is a Jewish atheist and apparently a direct descendant of the author of the Lechem Mishnah commentary on Maimonides&#8217; Mishnah Torah. The book is excellent and I highly recommend that everyone read it.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the book is written for atheists. I think believers should read this book at least as much as atheists should read it. The book tries to show that there is a lot that atheists can learn from religion. Generally speaking, de Botton argues that even if religion is  complete bunk there is a reason it developed, evolved, and flourishes. There are evolutionary needs that religion addresses. Religion serves a very important role in the scheme of man&#8217;s existence and when people abandon religion as atheists, they risk losing the very important evolutionary benefits of religion.</p>
<p>In other words, atheists cannot abandon the principles of religion simply because they disbelieve in God. In fact, it almost makes no sense to do that. An atheist must believe that religion evolved as a response to a human need because the atheists does not believe that religion could possibly be a revelation from God since God does not exist according to the atheist! It follows that according to atheists, religion is a human response to some innate needs and its development and success are vital to the success and progress of humanity. Excising religion from the human experience may be necessary for the atheist, but it is fraught with risks. There are elements of religion that are necessary for human development and without religion, those needs may not be met.<span id="more-6667"></span></p>
<p>So the book then goes on to describe some of the humanistic benefits of various religions. Most of the focus is on Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism. I found the references to Judaism very fascinating and enlightening. The author even uses some of the harshest victims of atheistic criticism as examples of worthy ideas that should be emulated. For example, he uses mikvah, (yes mikvah!), as an example of attaching ritual and meaning to washing. He says that there is something valuable in attaching bathing to renewal and associating outer washing with inner purity. As orthodox Jews, we may scoff at this humanistic approach to mikvah and it may not be sufficient to allay some of the discomfort that some orthodox Jewish women have with mikvah, but it is refreshing to see a non-believer try to find beauty and meaning in this practice.</p>
<p>Another great example in the book is his section on forgiveness. Yom Kippur is an ingenious way of reconnecting people. It is a day where we are forced to reconcile with our past. Non-believers need such a day as well.</p>
<p>Most importantly, religion creates community and responsibility toward one another. The book mentions Jewish weddings and Bar Mitzvah celebrations as important rituals within a community that should be emulated by non-believers.</p>
<p>The follow up point to each example is that atheists must create analogous practices and rituals for their lives in order to satisfy their needs that are not being met by the absence of religion in their lives. The book proposes cathedrals for atheists, yearly celebrations of bounty, and other corollaries to religious practices for atheists. The proposals are fantastic.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mostly theoretical book because I don&#8217;t see how any of this would every come into being. But if it would happen, I think it would be great for society.</p>
<p>Although the book is written for atheists, I think there is something important here for believers as well. We need to appreciate the depth and beauty of our religious practices. We need to see how to a non-believer many of our practices are useful even if God did not exist. To us, who believe God does exist, the benefits of religion are even greater. We need to appreciate how incredibly useful our religion is to our psyche and wellbeing and we need to thank God for giving us such a wonderful way of life to satisfy those needs. This is the true value of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> to the believer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not recommending orthopraxy. I am suggesting that the believer take into account all that religion does for the believer in a religious but also in a secular, psychological, and evolutionary way. We need to realize that what we are doing was given to us by God and it goes beyond just ritual or Divine command that has no non-religious benefit. We should acknowledge and explore the potential humanistic reasons for practicing orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The book also can serve as a bit of a bridge between atheists and believers. It gives us common ground and serves as an antidote to the Dawkins inspired derision of religion. I&#8217;d pay a lot of money to see a debate between Dawkins and de Botton. I also wish the Chief Rabbi would have read this book and incorporated some of its lessons in his Op-Ed earlier this week.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307379108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307379108">Religion for Atheists</a> enough. It is a great book for believers and non-believers alike.</p>

<p>I have NOT read the book. I have read the interview.</p>
<p>The book is a study of how and why religions became part of the human experience from the perspective of social evolution. The premise is that humans need religion and this spawned religion.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not a perspective that most religious people are going to be comfortable sharing. For religious people, religion came directly from God. Not because of a human need to create religion.</p>
<p>Although, reading the interview made me think about how religions view other contemporary religions to their own and religions that preceded their own. For example, what does Judaism / Christianity / Islam / Buddhism / Hinduism / Native American religions etc. say about how the &#8220;others&#8221; practice. If each religion claims it was revealed by God then what are all those other people doing? Did God give them other instructions? Or did <em>they</em> invent their religions while <em>yours</em> is correct? Where did those religions come from if God only revealed your religion?</p>
<p>Very interesting questions.<span id="more-4524"></span></p>
<p>As for Judaism, Maimonides has a comprehensive approach to explain the existence of religions prior to Abraham and how one served God before the revelation of the Torah.</p>
<p>Briefly, God revealed to Adam some basic commandments but of primary importance was to recognize the existence of a Singular, All Powerful Creator. A few individuals were able to maintain this level of observance. But most people corrupted it and began to focus their attention to things that they viewed as &#8220;powers&#8221; such as the sun, moon, wind etc. Instead of worshipping the Creator they worshipped these &#8220;powers&#8221;. Eventually this gave way to full blown pagan religions.</p>
<p>The only monotheistic religion was the small group of people who followed Adam&#8217;s teachings. Abraham was chosen as the man from whom would grow a people who would teach this system. Eventually this became the Jewish people who got a much more complete set of instructions at Sinai.</p>
<p>Christianity and Islam are clear and direct branches off the Judaism tree.</p>
<p>We are forced to say that other religions either evolved from the original pagans who did not accept the monotheism of Adam / Abraham or that they borrowed ideas from existing Adam / Abraham monotheism. As for their claims that God revealed their religion to them through a prophet and the instructions differ from ours, there are two points. First, there is certainly room for prophecy among non-Jews but it is unlikely that a pagan would be a prophet considering the qualifications. Further, if the prophet contradicted the Torah or the Abrahamic version of monotheism we would be forced to say the prophet is a fraud.</p>
<p>Being part of a global community of religions sometimes means that we need to admit that our traditions are mutually exclusive. I think it is important and worthwhile to analyze how we deal with questions about how other religions were formed. Each religion believes it is the right one. But they cannot ignore the fact that others exist.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the presence of such questions and analyzing their answers does not prove or disprove the validity of religion in general or a specific religion in question.</p>
