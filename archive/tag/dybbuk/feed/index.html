				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ami Magazine published an article by Sara Yocheved Rigler that would have many of our Geonim and Rishonim turning over in their graves. In a nutshell, the article describes strange phenomena such as fear of Nazi related imagery or fear of situations that might be similar to Holocaust experiences. The people experiencing these things are not able to explain why they have these fears.</p>
<p>According to the article, these are manifestations of reincarnated souls from the Holocaust. That is the only explanation given for these oddities (which are not very odd at all). In fact, the article goes so far as to suggest that non-Jews are also reincarnated with Jewish souls from the Holocaust and this is what draws them toward conversion. Of course this is problematic because those who believe in reincarnation and recycling of souls also believe that souls only transmigrate from Jew to Jew and non-Jews are given new souls with each birth. This is waved away by a rabbi quoted in the article who says if you wanted to be a non-Jew in a previous life you come back as a non-Jew.</p>
<p>I have three basic issues with this article.<span id="more-7676"></span></p>
<p>1. It is disingenuous because it uses anecdotes from people who do not necessarily agree with the article as support for the article&#8217;s ideas. For example, Rabbi Berel Wein is quoted at the beginning of the article. He related that the Ponevezher Rav once said to a group of young couples in Miami that their job was to repopulate the world with Jews in the aftermath of the Holocaust. That is a common Jewish sentiment from the mid-20th century. The problem is that it is being used as some sort of support for the idea that Jews born in America are reincarnations of people who perished in the Holocaust. He said nothing of the sort. He meant nothing of the sort. There is simply no reason to think he did.</p>
<p>Another similar example is using R&#8217; Lau&#8217;s recollection of the Holocaust. He famously said that experiencing the Holocaust as a child left him with three strong memories. Dogs, boots, and trains. This is somehow used as support for the idea that someone who is afraid of boots is reincarnated from someone who perished in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Neither of those stories has anything to do with reincarnation. But it gives the article &#8220;credence&#8221; to toss a few familiar names into the article to prove irrelevant, agreed upon points.</p>
<p>2. Stay away from the Holocaust. Trying to explain Holocaust deaths as <em>tikkun</em> and a way of cleansing a soul is offensive. We don&#8217;t know why people die. We don&#8217;t even know if there is always a reason that people die. To try to make death feel better because it&#8217;s part of a giant soul reincarnation cleansing plan is no better than saying they died because of their sins. It&#8217;s ugly.</p>
<p>But more importantly, it demonstrates that the real reason reincarnation is being discussed in this context is to make us feel better. We don&#8217;t understand death and destruction so we explain it with reincarnation. We don&#8217;t understand how millions could die for no reason so we explain it with reincarnation. We can&#8217;t explain a fear of showers or boots so it must be reincarnated souls from the Holocaust. There might be better answers to these questions. But the article does not explore them. Using the emotional appeal of the Holocaust to draw us into a reincarnation narrative is inappropriate.</p>
<p>3. Most importantly, reincarnation is a very controversial subject in Judaism. It&#8217;s not mentioned in Tanach. It&#8217;s not mentioned in the Talmud or Medrash. It&#8217;s rejected by most of the Geonim. It is rejected or ignored by many of the mainstream Rishonim. It serves no theological purpose other than to explain things that might be able to be explained in another way.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Gilgul-Ami.pdf"><br />
</a></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7678" alt="img-kickstartbusiness" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/img-kickstartbusiness.jpg" /></p>
<p>The article jumps right into reincarnation without a moment&#8217;s consideration of the very prominent Torah authority figures that reject reincarnation. This is at worst a lie and at best ignorance. But either way it is incomplete. Gilgul is not a necessary belief in orthodox Judaism. In fact, it might be worst to believe in it than not to believe in it. Why are we normalizing this kind of thing? Why are we discarding the valid opinions that don&#8217;t hold of gilgul? Why is it okay to just side with the Arizal on everything and forget about everyone else?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t need to make the complete case against gilgul here. But I will make a couple of points.</p>
<p>The Ancient Greeks believed in reincarnation. We did not. We knew their beliefs and we rejected them in the time of Chazal. It&#8217;s impossible to say that Jews did not talk about reincarnation because they just didn&#8217;t know that it could exist. It was known and it was not accepted. It began to be accepted by a select few Rishonim after being rejected by the two most prominent early Rishonim that discuss Hashkafa, Rambam and Rabbi Judah HaLevi. The one prominent Rishon who does mention gilgul is Ramban and he does so at the expense of an interpretation on the verse that is in Chazal. In other words, they had a different explanation for the verse. The interpretation of Ramban contradicts Chazal.</p>
<p>In the 15th and 16th century there was a renewed interest in this sort of thing. Dybbuks also became more popular in this period. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/21/book-review-between-worlds-dybbuks-exorcists-and-early-modern-judaism/">Between Worlds: Dybbuks, Exorcists, and Early Modern Judaism </a>) But it&#8217;s no fait accompli that gilguls and dybbuks are part of Judaism. We have no idea if it&#8217;s true and our early sources say that it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a positive development that these beliefs have gone mainstream. They are too easy to reject and cast aspersion on the more vital parts of Judaism. We don&#8217;t need this stuff in Judaism and it doesn&#8217;t improve our lives. Why are we so willing and eager to embrace it in our publications without question? This is my little protest. Don&#8217;t force these beliefs down our throats. It&#8217;s not integral to Judaism.</p>
<p><em>(Note: Reincarnation at the times of Messiah has nothing to do with this discussion.)</em></p>

I saw it just after I wrote about the modern day exorcist here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/10/28/demons-dybbuks-devils-and-exorcism/" target="_blank">Demons, Dybbuks, Devils and Exorcism</a>. Buying this book was a smart decision. I read the book a little while back and neglected to do a review but I&#8217;ve wanted to tell you all about this book since I read it.</p>
<p>The author, J.H Chajes, is a professor at University of Haifa. He is a distant relative of the great Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Chajes. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> is very scholarly and well researched. Yet, it reads like a novel, well almost like a novel, and it kept me engrossed in its content from start to finish.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a> chronicles the rise of recorded incidents of dybbuks and exorcism in the era of mystical writings of the Arizal&#8217;s students. Most of the book takes place in the 16th and 17th centuries. The book traces the relationship between Christian, Muslim and Jewish exorcism legends and practice as well. An appendix has full accounts of exorcisms found in rabbinic literature from that era.</p>
<p>As a skeptic, I found the restraint of Chajes astounding. It is almost as if he is winking the entire time that he is writing about demonic / disembodied soul possession. You just know that he can&#8217;t believe what he is writing as fact is even possible. But he writes as an objective 3rd party about rabbis and others performing exorcisms with a straight face.</p>
<p>There are a few points that I took away from the book that are worth sharing.<span id="more-4968"></span> First of all, the book mentions some disputes between rabbis. They were vicious disagreements. Accusations of philandering, abject immorality and horrible insults are hurled the way of one particular rabbi. I can only imagine what our rabbinic disputes will look like to historians some time in the future. Fascinating to read and fascinating to think about.</p>
<p>Second, the book supports the theory that &#8220;the more knowledge becomes accessible, the more some religious leaders will try to &#8216;esotericize&#8217; their religion to maintain a level of separation between the masses and the public&#8221;. I know, that theory is a mouthful. With regard to exorcism it works as follows. The masses were becoming more literate throughout the world. Exorcism was an art reserved for spiritual leaders and scholars. It was not available to the masses no matter how learned they became. Thus, the existence of demons and dybbuks reinforced the need for leadership. It is similar to today&#8217;s maximalist position of Daas Torah. In a time that more orthodox Jews can study the sources and responsa on a given subject, the religious leaders have reserved a segment of inaccessible knowledge under the maximalist position of Daas Torah. I&#8217;m not saying this is wrong or intentional, rather it is a pattern and it happens.</p>
<p>My third point for this review is the nature of the relationship between Jewish scholars and their Christian and Muslim counterparts. It seems that there was much interaction between them and they worked together, at least for the sake of exorcism. It was nice to see cooperation instead of the stereotypical debates and polemics against one another. If they could do it, so could we.</p>
<p>If you have ANY interest in dybbuks or demons or exorcism or 16th century mysticism, buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812221702/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0812221702" target="_blank">Between Worlds</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Exorcise-The-Demons_cff6cea96e32fd584d19254f66bacadf.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4744" title="Exorcise-The-Demons" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Exorcise-The-Demons_cff6cea96e32fd584d19254f66bacadf-300x204.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></a>A new docudrama about exorcism is making the news. A recent movie called The Rite was based on the real life tales of a priest named Father Gary Thomas. Now Father Thomas is telling the world his experiences through the docudrama.</p>
<p>In Catholicism, exorcism is the process of removing the devil from one who has been possessed or attached by the devil. A priest who is trained in the ancient rite is brought in and removes the spirit from the victim.</p>
<p>Mystical Judaism has a similar phenomena called a dybbuk. A dybbuk is supposedly a dislocated fragment of a dead person&#8217;s soul that attaches itself to a living person. The dybbuk is removed by a Kabbalist.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a thought experiment: Would a priest be able to exorcise a dybbuk? Or can a kabbalist remove the devil from someone who is possessed?<span id="more-4743"></span></p>
<p>Either way, both exorcism and dybbuks are subject to much scrutiny and skepticism. Much of which is very similar.</p>
<p>Father Thomas describes one who possessed as people who exhibit</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;an aversion to the sacred, an inability to go to mass, &#8230;or Church, an inability to take the Sacraments. An inordinate strength a person doesn&#8217;t normally possess, knowledge of hidden things, speaking in a language that people have no previous competency in, also taking on the appearance of something that would look reptilian.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Hardly seems demonic. Well except for the whole reptilian thing. But I refuse to believe that. I am sure if it were true there would be <em>some </em>medical or scientific unanswered question about this phenomena. I have not found anything of the sort.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, very concerned people are asking the good priest how they can avoid being possessed.</p>
<p>Fascinatingly enough, the answer is that the devil only possesses people who invite the devil in or someone else could invite the demon in for you (that hardly seems fair). Protection for a Catholic is to live pure life, a faith life, a spiritual and a sacramental life. For non-Catholics it is to live a pure life, a moral life and a faith life. For non-Christians protection comes if you practice &#8220;something along the same lines&#8221;.</p>
<p>So it sounds like the devil is in cahoots with the Church and helps the priests by punishing people who don&#8217;t go to Church and don&#8217;t like going to Church. What a wonderful system. Classic &#8220;blame the victim&#8221;. It&#8217;s like when people are abused the traditionalists sometimes say &#8220;you must have wanted it&#8221;.</p>
<p>It seems so easy to be cynical about exorcism and demons but if we are to be cynical of this belief it behooves us to also analyze the mystical Jewish belief that feels so similar. Consider that.</p>
<p>But what is it that draws people to believe in these supernatural evil spirits? Why is it that the more we know about science, the more it seems like some religions push back and stress their less scientific beliefs?</p>
<p>This is a question I hope to answer in some future blog post. In the meantime, think about it.</p>
