				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6960" alt="iiTDIn4h" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/iiTDIn4h-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" />There is an album of photos showing an amazing teapot on Reddit. Popchassid took the post from Reddit and turned it into a blog post. The teapot is pretty incredible. It has a bunch of compartments that hid several ritual items used in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The owner of the teapot says this about the teapot: &#8220;<em>I got this from grandfather before he died. First used by hidden Jews during the inquisition, it is shaped like a teapot, but contains many secret Judaica pieces. The Hidden Synagogue.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that there is no way this teapot dates back to the Inquisition.</p>
<p>The Inquisition was in 15th century Spain. One of the ritual items in the teapot is a dreidle. Many people are familiar with dreidle. They are a Jewish version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotum" target="_blank">teetotums</a>. Jews have played dreidle on Chanukah for at most a few hundred years. The word dreidle is Yiddish and it refers to the turning of the top.</p>
<p>Traditionally, teetotoums were played around Christmastime. That started in Eastern Europe a few centuries ago. We borrowed the game and made it work for Chanukah. No harm in that. But a tradition subsequently emerged that dreidle was played ever since the rabbis established the holiday of Chanukah. There is no evidence to support this claim.<span id="more-6959"></span></p>
<p>The Inquisition targeted Sephardic Jews. I am sure many Sephardic Jews used clever ways to disguise their practice of Judaism. It is possible that they may have used teapots to disguise their rituals. However, there is no tradition of dreidle among Sephardic Jews. There is no word for dreidle in a language other than Yiddish. Ergo, it is entirely improbable that a dreidle is in a teapot that dates back to the Inquisition.</p>
<p>My great-uncle has a boat that also has all the rituals hidden inside it. I don&#8217;t think that he claims that the boat was a disguise from persecution, I think it was just a cool way of incorporating Judaism into art. In other words, it&#8217;s possible that this teapot was not actually made or ever used to hide Jewish practices. It was an art form and it was for the sake of art.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an amazing piece of Jewish history, a true treasure. But let&#8217;s be careful to separate fact from fantasy.</p>

It was originally posted on Reddit where it has generated a decent conversation and a respectable 86 comments at this moment.</p>
<p>All the necessary information is in there. The question is not about her parents and their philosophy, it is about the young woman and what she should do. My opinion follows the question.</p>
<p>Without further ado, have at it.</p>
<p><strong>How do I tell my mother that being asked to marry another Jewish person as an atheist is against what I believe?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I grew up centerist Orthodox. I&#8217;m an atheist who is culturally Jewish in that I read the Forward, some orthodox blogs, and that is it. I don&#8217;t care if my (nonexistant) kids know that about me, and I don&#8217;t care if in my (nonexistant) marriage that we celebrate Hannukah or passover or christmas. My brother is dating a non-Jewish girl, and my parents are threatening that if he marries her, they will take out a restraining order if he tries to talk them after the marriage. Meanwhile, I&#8217;m sitting here realizing that it might be a bad idea to marry another affiliated with a synagogue type Jewish person, because I don&#8217;t want that for my kids. It is more important to me that they be free thinking, particularly about moral issues, than have a rabbi/school system tell them what to believe. I&#8217;m currently single, I&#8217;d like to meet another atheist, preferably one who is driven by moral questions (since I am). How do I tell my parents, particularly my mother, that asking me to marry an affiliated Jewish person is probably a bad idea.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Technically speaking, despite growing up orthodox, it would be an intermarriage, and likely to fail because I wouldn&#8217;t share values.</em></p>
<p>Since I too am a reader of this blog I am have taken the liberty of offering my opinion:<span id="more-5656"></span></p>
<p>Although we oftentimes resent it, other people&#8217;s feelings about us should play a role in our decisions. I know that sounds very old fashioned and repressive, but I think it is truer than progressives like to think.</p>
<p>Parents are not just biological sperm and egg donors. They are not just responsible for raising us and nurturing us through the trials of childhood and our teenage years. Parents and children are connected in a deeper way in that they have had the most influence over our lives and their presence or absence can have a far ranging impact on our adult years as well.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think step one is to determine if you can be happy and at the same time satisfy their needs. I don&#8217;t mean that one should <em>sacrifice </em>one&#8217;s happiness for the sake of a parent&#8217;s specific request. But if one knows what their parents want and it can conform with one&#8217;s own needs, I think that should be the preferable choice.</p>
<p>Allowing the feelings of a third party influence our decision making is not be default allowing them to control us. It can be very empowering to accommodate the feelings of others. Especially when the stakes are so high. We are talking about parents here. Not Hebrew School teachers.</p>
<p>I know that it may feel &#8220;fake&#8221; or that it would seem wrong for a young adult to narrow one&#8217;s marriage prospects to a smaller pool because of one&#8217;s parents&#8217; request. But I think that making the conscious choice not to burn that bridge and at the same time not settle in one&#8217;s search for a marriage partner is the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>That being said, if one would feel that their parents ruined their marriage prospects and bear resentment towards them for forcing them to marry against their own wishes, I don&#8217;t think it is worth considering the wishes of the parents. Only if one can be happy with the choice is it a fair choice.</p>
<p>Further, there are a lot of Jewish atheists. Many of them are culturally Jewish or they simply identify with some Jewish ideals and causes despite not being religious or believers in God. Jewish and religious are not necessarily corollaries. I think a Jewish atheist can marry another Jewish atheist and it would not feel like an intermarriage, it would feel very comfortable. In fact, marrying a non-Jewish atheist will probably strain the marriage more than marrying a Jewish non-atheist would. This is simply because of the cultural osmosis that all people who were brought up Jewish experience.</p>
<p>Finally, you ask <em>How do I tell my mother that being asked to marry another Jewish person as an atheist is against what I believe?</em></p>
<p>The answer to that is that although it may be against your &#8220;beliefs&#8221;, it may not go against your &#8220;interests&#8221; and those are equally if not more important than living by one&#8217;s convictions. It&#8217;s not faking to make a concession on beliefs for the same of interests. It&#8217;s prudent.</p>
<p>In the end, I think there are enough options to keep your parents and you happy and I would recommend exhausting those options first so long as you are able to conquer any  of your own natural resentment.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I am a lesbian marrying a gay man. We are out to each other and our closest friends. We both grew up in religious, traditional communities so we decided this was best for us. We both travel a lot so we are able to &#8220;explore&#8221; outside of the marriage. Ask away&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em></em><em>Edit: we are doing this to stay connected to our community and our traditional (Orthodox Jewish) families.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Edit: to be clear, we are both seeing other people outside our relationship. We are out to close friends. I came out to my parents a while ago so technically they know but think that I have &#8220;changed&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>There are over 1100 comments on the post as I type these words. They are worth seeing.</p>
<p>This couple&#8217;s story is not as unique as one might think. In the summer there was an article in Time Magazine about a rabbi who arranged similar marriages between homosexual members of the opposite gender.<span id="more-4750"></span></p>
<p>Gay activists have been known to find this kind of arrangement backward, regressive and bigoted. They argue that gay people should be able to marry other gay people. And why stay in a community that shuns your sexuality?</p>
<p>Orthodox Jews have also been known to find this arrangement objectionable as well. The common orthodox Jewish objection is usually formulated along the lines of &#8220;they should just not be gay&#8221; or something like that.</p>
<p>I think both arguments are flawed. There is something important that can be learned from these arrangements. It speaks to the fundamental difference between the secular view of marriage and the orthodox Jewish view of marriage.</p>
<p>The secular view of marriage is mostly about love and intimacy. When the love one has for one&#8217;s significant other rises to the level that warrants commitment, marriage is the logical choice. Viewed in this light, without love what is the point of marriage. Marriage is a validation of the relationship. And if the relationship is missing love and intimacy then there is little point to the union.</p>
<p>In the end, many secular marriages end up being loveless and without intimacy. Some survive for the sake of kids or because divorce is taboo. But they have little utility when the spark is gone. So divorce is a wise, if not the only choice.</p>
<p>In general, this speaks to an overall secular attitude that places intimacy and love above nearly all other values. After all, all you need is love.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in orthodox Judaism, marriage is about much more than love and intimacy. It could even be argued that love and intimacy are of the least important aspects to a marriage. Arranged marriages, short dating periods and short engagements result in many wonderful marriages. Marriage is about raising a family, being part of a community, creating an environment that promotes personal growth and healthy self-sacrifice. Part of all that includes intimacy and love. A good loving environment will help further greater goals.</p>
<p>But in the absence of love and intimacy there can still be monumental value in marriage. Even without love and intimacy, as long as there is no strife or abuse, there could be real valuable reasons to stay in the marriage. Divorce can be a reasonable choice. But I don&#8217;t think it is the only reasonable choice.</p>
<p>In light of this, raising a traditional family, staying in one&#8217;s community with one&#8217;s family and forgoing the supposed love and intimacy of marriage could be a reasonable choice in an orthodox Jewish environment.</p>
<p>I am not saying that I condone these marriages and arrangements nor do I think that I would recommend them. But I do think that these arrangements indicate something lofty about the goals and ideals of marriage in the orthodox Jewish world. It is much more than love and intimacy and in fact, it could work without those things. It could work very well.</p>
<p>And for the sake of these daring trailblazers I hope it does.</p>
