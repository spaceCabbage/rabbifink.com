				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7128" alt="alaska-erosion-photo" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/alaska-erosion-photo-300x210.jpg" width="300" height="210" /></a>The fallout over the Doheny Kosher meat scandal continues. This week, the Jewish Journal reported that three kosher restaurants have dropped the RCC Hechsher in favor of alternative hechshers.</p>
<p>This can only mean one thing. RCC is not as good for the bottom line as the other hechshers. The only real reason a restaurant will switch is to increase business. It seems that RCC businesses are suffering. I have some first hand information from vendors that this is the case as well.</p>
<p>It goes even further. Shiloh&#8217;s Restaurant has a splash page of their website that assures customers that they are and always have been using Kehilla for their hechsher and not RCC. The note distances Shiloh&#8217;s from Doheny Kosher Meat as well. See the note here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gUiNl0R.png" target="_blank">Shiloh&#8217;s</a></p>
<p>All this can only mean one thing. A significant number of people have been spooked by the kashrus scandal. It goes so far that people need to be reassured that a kosher restaurant did not purchase any meat from Doheny.<span id="more-7127"></span></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. The halachic authority who was counseled on this case and is a senior <em>posek</em> for the OU already said that there was no halachic problem for consumers or restaurants who bought from Doheny. The RCC has admitted there were issues and they are fixing them. Some of the restaurants that switched don&#8217;t even sell meat!</p>
<p>The point here is that people are basically ignoring the halachic psak given in this case. Who are these people? Are they <em>frummer</em> than halacha? Why would anyone be concerned if a restaurant got meat from Doheny? The psak is that there is no problem if one bought meat from Doheny? What are they worried about?</p>
<p>The funny thing is that people will harp on Daas Torah for every <em>chumra</em> or <em>hashkafic</em> nuance as long as it looks more frum. But the second Daas Torah says something is permissible those same people become independent thinkers who don&#8217;t rely on Daas Torah.</p>
<p>On the one hand I see this as an erosion of Daas Torah. Some might see that as a positive development. Some might see that as a negative development. Either way, it seems that people are not buying into Daas Torah completely. It&#8217;s only when it suits my <em>chumra</em> lifestyle or to marginalize others that I will listen to Daas Torah they say. On the other hand not trusting RCC (especially for dairy!) after a <em>psak</em> that says there is nothing to worry about from a halachic perspective, is a huge problem. If we do not rely on our <em>poskim</em> for <em>heter</em> we are in big trouble. I do not like the direction this is heading. We must be able to rely on <em>psak halacha, </em>especially when the halacha is lenient.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6836" alt="store-front" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/store-front.jpg" width="293" height="200" />As of Sunday March 24, 2013 at 3 PM, Doheny Kosher Meats is no longer under the rabbinic supervision of the RCC. In a statement released to the greater Los Angeles community, the RCC said that the hechsher was removed for cause.</p>
<p>KTLA news reports that a private investigator filmed Doheny Kosher receiving empty boxes with kosher labeling on them and a stash of kosher labels. It appears that this is the extent of what has been discovered. This is a violation of the agreement between Doheny and the RCC thus invalidating their supervision. It also implies that Doheny has been receiving non-kosher meat deliveries and replacing the non-kosher labels with kosher labels.</p>
<p>However, it does not seem that any non-kosher meat was found in Doheny nor were there any deliveries of non-kosher meats filmed. Therefore, the status of the meat purchased before the breach of protocol was discovered is still considered kosher. This is because a kosher store has a &#8220;status&#8221; (chazaka) of kosher until there is evidence to the contrary. There is only evidence of a breach of protocol so the entire store is now suspect but before this breach was discovered the halachic status quo remains intact and the food is considered kosher. Pots and dishes are also considered kosher.</p>
<p>At this point, nothing other than the breach of protocol is certain. It is possible, although very remote, that this all an honest mix up.</p>
<p>In contrast with the Monsey Kosher Scandal, there was no non-kosher meat discovered. In Monsey, chickens from non-kosher distributors were discovered on site. This meant that there was no longer &#8220;doubt&#8221; about some of the meat and the halachic status was invalidated.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Doheny was involved in a kashrus dustup when it was forced to go all Glatt lest it lose its hechsher. They complied.</p>
<p>Right now there are four unanswered questions.</p>
<p>1) Was non-kosher meat delivered to Doheny and was it distributed to its consumers?</p>
<p>2) Who hired the private detective and why?</p>
<p>3) Why did it take a private investigator to discover this breach and not the paid mashgiach?</p>
<p>4) Everyone said Doheny meats tasted the best. I&#8217;ve heard this for years. They said the same thing about the guy in Monsey&#8217;s meats. Why do non-kosher meats taste better?<span id="more-6835"></span></p>

<p>I love LA.</p>
<p>Living in LA has its perks. You get great weather 300 days a year, really friendly neighbors, not too many bugs, plenty of excitement, just enough peace and quiet, the Lakers, and a Shul on the Beach (with a lucky Rabbi). But like any big city, there are some drawbacks to living in LA. The traffic, superficiality, the helicopters outside my window at 2 AM, the expensive housing, and the schmutz.</p>
<p>What is schmutz? Literally, it means dirt. But in this context it means dirty in a provocative or an overtly sexual manner. (© me this very second)<span id="more-2525"></span></p>
<p>Billboards rise like giant monoliths all over the city conveying their messages of sex, wealth and superficial, fleeting &#8220;happiness&#8221;. Now, most of the time I don&#8217;t complain about the billboards. Most billboards are innocuous enough. Some are a little too risque for my tastes, but it is nothing that disrupts my role as a decent human being or a parent. However, the over-hyped, flop of a movie called Sex and the City 2 has crossed the line of decency.</p>
<p>Sex and the City 2 billboards have overtaken the city.</p>
<p>Everywhere you look there is a big ol&#8217; billboard with the giant words &#8220;Sex and the City 2&#8243;.</p>
<p>The word sex can mean one than one thing. But sex &#8220;in the city&#8221; has only one meaning. Sex is not a bad word when used in the right context and in front of the right audience. An inappropriate audience would be a listener who is not old enough to understand what the word means, what it entails and when its use is appropriate. It would be wrong to have an open, frank conversation about sex with a young child.</p>
<p>A seven year old child can read well enough to see the word sex, but is not able to understand the word. There is just no way to have a conversation with a young child about sex. It is not age appropriate.</p>
<p>My son reads all the billboards (and also tons of books) and sometimes he even remembers the words on the billboards. Sometimes he repeats the things he sees on billboards. One day he was muttering to himself &#8220;Sex and the City&#8221;. He says &#8220;I can&#8217;t get it out of my head&#8221;, &#8220;what does it even mean?&#8221;.</p>
<p>&lt;Quick, change the subject&gt;</p>
<p>I know all about &#8220;Free Speech&#8221;. But when an audience does not have a choice or warning about the content of the speech it can be regulated. (<em>See </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission_v._Pacifica_Foundation" target="_blank"><em>FCC v Pacifica</em></a><em>: The Court accepted as compelling, the government&#8217;s interests in 1) shielding children from patently offensive material, and 2) ensuring that unwanted speech does not enter one&#8217;s home. The Court stated that the FCC had the authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience, and gave the FCC broad leeway to determine what constituted indecency in different contexts</em>.) I think this rule could apply to billboards the same way it applies to radio.</p>
<p>The problem is that the speech is being directed at ANYONE who can read, with no warning and no way to shield a child from its message. That includes my son, who was reading simple words like &#8220;sex&#8221;  (or fox, or dad, or mom, or dog) at the age of 3! Do people think it is appropriate for 3 year old children to read words that will be impossible to define for them?! A provocative image is not going to prompt the kinds of questions that a word can. A kid sees a word and can read it, the kid wants to know what it means! What is one supposed to tell their kids?</p>
<p>If someone was asking me what to do, I would probably try and come up with something clever like, &#8220;it&#8217;s an adult word and when you get older you will understand what it means&#8221;. I guess that is the best I can do. But I find it offensive that young children don&#8217;t seem to be considered in what is permissible on a public billboard.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be some level of regulation beyond what exists now. Am I crazy?</p>

We in Los Angeles hear that classic tune after every Lakers home victory. And there are plenty of those&#8230; I also hear it every time someone calls my wife&#8217;s mobile phone. It is her ringtone.</p>
<p>Today I had such a strong reminder of why living in Los Angeles is so great.</p>
<p>In addition to Law School and serving as the Rabbi on the Beach at Pacific Jewish Center, I work at the California Court of Appeals twice a week. The California Court of Appeals is in downtown Los Angeles, in how shall we say&#8230; a transitional neighborhood.</p>
<p>On my way from work to school something that doesn&#8217;t happen in my hometown of Monsey NY happened right before my eyes.<span id="more-2260"></span> As I was turning from Spring Street onto 8th Street a homeless man ran behind my car, unzipped his pants and relieved himself in front of incoming traffic. Yikes!</p>
<p>I went on to Law School, not traumatized, but slightly disturbed.</p>
<p>But on my way home from school, I experienced something so wonderful that said incident can be swept right under the carpet.</p>
<p>The weather was gorgeous today. It was at least 80 degrees and as dusk settled, it would have been obscene to have the car windows up. So I &#8220;rolled&#8221; down the windows and took in the perfect weather. At first it was just a hint, but the longer I drove, the more I was sure that I was smelling lilacs. Everywhere I drove lilacs were blooming. The air was infected with their perfumy scent and I was smitten. I sniffed my way home and I enjoyed every moment of the usually mind-numbing commute.</p>
<p>Even in serene Monsey NY flowers are not blooming so prolifically as to freshen the air of a huge swath of the city. Here in Los Angeles I was treated to a flowering garden potpourri on my commute home.</p>
<p>Oh ya, that sunburn I got while watching Rami play soccer on Sunday started to itch a little. Life&#8217;s tough in LA.</p>
<p>I ♡ LA</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>I love <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-US/default.aspx" target="_blank">Lego</a>. My brother and I spent countless hours in our childhood building magnificent Lego creations. My son Rami has recently added Lego building to his skill set &#8211; he is quite good!</p>
<p>If I had to choose one toy to play with I would certainly choose Lego. It is the perfect toy.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe me? You need to check this out&#8230;<span id="more-319"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://niemann.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/i-lego-ny/" target="_blank">This New York Times Opinion piece</a> will show you what Lego is all about. This guy did a great job.</p>
<p>In addition although we love LA and don&#8217;t want to live in New York, there is a nostalgia that always will be associated with NYC. Just ask Kobe Bryant. He says his favorite (<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ROAz5SkUMu8" target="_blank">and most succesful in recent memory</a>) place to play is New York. New York is a special place but there is no way I would trade <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/adegerma/49%20Santa%20Monica%20Beach.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> for <a href="http://z.about.com/d/manhattan/1/0/i/1/centralparksnowybench1.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. (It&#8217;s been 80 degrees for a couple weeks now). As<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/13/california-dreaming-no-longer/" target="_blank"> I mentioned previously</a> it&#8217;s not just about the weather but it sure is nice&#8230;</p>
