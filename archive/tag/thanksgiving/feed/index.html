				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>There is no more perfect secular holiday than Thanksgiving. It has a universal message, warm traditions, and is versatile enough to work to all kinds of people. I think it&#8217;s especially wonderful that so many Jewish people, including Orthodox Jews, have embraced Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>On a Jewish level there is nothing more basic than giving thanks. Gratitude begins the moment we arise with Modeh Ani. But that is a private declaration of appreciation to God. Thanksgiving gives us an opportunity to build greater gratitude with our friends and family. It&#8217;s a time to publicly give thanks to God and all the people in our lives who deserves appreciation. It&#8217;s true that we must be thankful everyday, but setting aside one day a year as a communal expression of appreciation is a wise tradition.<span id="more-7907"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7908" alt="The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961-600x382.jpg" width="360" height="229" /></a>Further, Jews need to be thankful simply for the existence of Thanksgiving. It is a uniquely American holiday and we have been blessed in America, flourishing and growing in unprecedented numbers. Thanksgiving celebrates America. We must celebrate America too. Indeed, we must be thankful for Thanksgiving itself.</p>
<p>Most of all, Thanksgiving gives us a splendid opportunity to share in an American tradition with our fellow Americans. So many other American traditions are antithetical to Torah and Judaism. We can&#8217;t in good conscience join in those celebrations. Christmas? Drinking and debauchery on New Years? Easter? as well as several other hallowed American traditions are not our traditions. But this one, Thanksgiving, that&#8217;s right in our wheelhouse. It gives us the chance to join together with the rest of America and in unison say thank you. That in itself is worth the effort to participate in the holiday. Although we don&#8217;t primarily associate as Americans, rather we are Jews first, it is a powerful declaration of unity to connect with 300 million Americans from diverse backgrounds, with a plurality of beliefs to celebrate Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>This year it&#8217;s even more fun as we can merge and meld some of our Chanukah traditions with Thanksgiving. The connections between the two holidays are self evident. Both were belated Sukkos style celebrations giving thanks to God. They are like siblings from the same parents.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s enjoy the holiday and be proud to live in a country that makes a holiday out of giving thanks, just like us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20071121-first-thanksgiving.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4873" title="20071121-first-thanksgiving" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/20071121-first-thanksgiving-300x252.png" alt="" width="300" height="252" /></a>You might find it odd that the day after Thanksgiving I am writing about Thanksgiving. The truth is that I am not really writing about Thanksgiving rather some of the nutty things that happened this year on Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Of course I am talking about some the controversies that arose regarding the celebrations of Thanksgiving that don&#8217;t fit the mold of the religious Christian Thanksgiving. Two incidents in particular created some buzz but I am sure there were others as well.</p>
<p>First we turn to the Butterball Turkey situation. One blogger called upon her readers to boycott Butterball because they dared to have their Turkeys Halal certified. This means that it is slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law. It is very similar to Shechita, the method of slaughter required by Jewish law. According to Ms. Geller:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Halal turkey, slaughtered according to the rules of Islamic law, is just the opposite of what Thanksgiving represents: freedom and inclusiveness, neither of which are allowed for under that same Islamic law.&#8221;<span id="more-4872"></span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, Thanksgiving DOES NOT represent freedom or inclusiveness. It never has and never will. I can provide Ms. Geller with a hint as to what the holiday represents &#8211; it&#8217;s in the name. Oh yes. It&#8217;s thanks and appreciation.</p>
<p>More importantly, any religious ceremony is by default not free or inclusive. Jewish law, Canon law, Islamic law, any religious law that makes specific requirements is not (on the surface) &#8220;freedom&#8221;. They are restrictions. Moreover, religious law is never going to be inclusive. It calls for rituals that make the performer of the ritual a religious person and by default the one who does not perform the ritual irreligious. This can create a barrier between the religious and irreligious. All religions suffer this potential flaw.</p>
<p>Just look at my Tim Tebow post from a couple days ago: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/11/23/tim-tebows-relationship-with-his-god/">Tim Tebow’s Relationship With His God</a>. Not everyone is so comfortable with Tebow&#8217;s religious proclivities. But have a look at the comment left by the Christian fellow in the comments. Do you think his religion is &#8220;inclusive&#8221; of me? (Or Ms. Geller?) Is that the sound of freedom? In Ms. Geller&#8217;s world that makes Tebow the commenter people who should not allowed to celebrate Thanksgiving. They are not inclusive enough.</p>
<p>Ms. Geller calls Halal slaughtering a form of torture. This is obviously offensive to all kosher eating people as well.</p>
<p>But the real point is that Ms. Geller is being as two-faced as one can be. By denying an entire group the right to have a Thanksgiving dinner, Ms. Geller is being as freedom hating and non-inclusive as one can be. But that was obvious.</p>
<p>Finally, I imagine that the reason Butterball markets Halal turkeys is because it is good business. To me, that&#8217;s just the free market that Ms. Geller loves so much.</p>
<p>Now we turn to controversy number two. The President gave the traditional Presidential Thanksgiving address and neglected to mention God in his words. The president dedicated this year&#8217;s holiday celebration to the troops fighting our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also thanked the volunteers in soup kitchens across America. So what was the problem? He did not mention God. This is a terrible sin that violates the ancient and holy laws of Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Never mind that in the Presidential Thanksgiving Proclamation he did mention God.</p>
<p>The omission set off a firestorm of vitriol toward the president.</p>
<p>A particularly bombastic twitterer called Obama a &#8220;militant atheist&#8221; for not mentioning God in the address. As irresponsible and insane of a statement it is to &#8220;out&#8221; someone as an atheist when they clearly are not an atheist, the tweet ignores the Proclamation and Obama&#8217;s 2009 and 2010 Thanksgiving addresses where he did mention God.</p>
<p>How is this reconciled? Was he a believer before but now he is all of the sudden a &#8220;militant atheist&#8221;? Or maybe he was a &#8220;militant atheist&#8221; all along but he has finally decided to own up to his true non-beliefs?</p>
<p>As far as militant atheists go, Obama would hardly be very successful. He goes to Church, says the appropriate God Bless Americas and to my knowledge has never engaged a believer in debate trying to convince the believer that belief in God is wrong.</p>
<p>Obama is not an atheist and certainly is not a militant atheist. This the kind of message that someone tweets to pander to right wing conservative Christians and bait left wing liberal non-Christians. It&#8217;s a call for attention. Well, he got it. Congratulations. But at what cost? Credibility. You can only say so many crazy things before everything you say is considered crazy.</p>
<p>All the silliness aside, I think that Thanksgiving is one day that should be enjoyed and celebrated by people of all faiths and people of no faith. That Ms. Geller and the bombastic twitterer feel that Thanksgiving must be celebrated in one way and in no other is a fallacy. Thanksgiving is the perfect time to push aside our differences and be thankful for the wonderful things in our lives to whomever or whatever we attribute them to.</p>
<p>The irony is that both Ms. Geller and the bombastic twitterer are Jewish and that they would prefer a Christian version of the holiday than a non-denominational celebration tells me that they have sold out the ever important freedom of religion and inclusiveness of America&#8217;s Constitution for the sake making friends in religious right.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving is for everyone. Let&#8217;s keep it that way.</p>
