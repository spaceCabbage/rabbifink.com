				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6694" alt="6081358_f520" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/6081358_f520-300x187.jpg" width="300" height="187" />This week we had two somewhat interesting Torah Temimahs. Neither are bombshells from the Torah Temimah, but they are still worth noting.</p>
<p><b>I. Science and Chazal</b></p>
<p><em>&#8220;These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.&#8221;</em> (Genesis 46:15)</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>R. Isaac citing R. Ammi stated: If the woman emits her semen first she bears a male child; if the man emits his semen first she bears a female child; for it is said, If a woman emits semen and bear a man-child.</em>&#8221; (Babylonian Talmud Nida 31A, translation Soncino)</p>
<p>The Talmud offers the verse from Vayigash as support for this statement. The idea is that the verse connects the sons to Leah and the daughter to Yaakov (thanks commenter Benny).</p>
<p>Now obviously, this is scientifically incorrect. There are several ways to deal with this kind of problem. Some will say Chazal were correct and science is incorrect. Others will say science is correct and Chazal are wrong. Others will say that the Talmud is speaking in metaphors, or mysticism, or some other non-literal interpretation.</p>
<p>It seems that the Torah Temimah is unaware that the science in this Talmudic statement was wrong, but he provides important insight nonetheless.<span id="more-6668"></span></p>
<p>If one were to try to say that Chazal were wrong about science in this instance, one might also need to say that the Torah was wrong. After all, Chazal are apparently gleaning this insight from the words in the Torah. While it is a matter of controversy to say Chazal were wrong about science, it is a matter of heresy to say the Torah is &#8220;wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Says the Torah Temimah (translation my own): <em>It seems obvious that substance of this idea was known to Chazal from the science [of their day] that everything goes according to the last force, and therefore if the man seeds first his force ends earlier and the embryo will follow the force of the end which is her seed and therefore the child will be female and vice versa. But only as a hint and sign did they rely on this verse. </em>Then the Torah Temimah proves from another Talmudic statement that this verse is not really a proof per se.</p>
<p>With this, the Torah Temimah has opened the door for one to say that Chazal were obviously basing their statement on contemporary science as opposed to some revealed wisdom and they were simply using the verse as a way of hinting toward their accepted wisdom. While this remains a matter of controversy in orthodox Jewish circles, it&#8217;s apparent that many great scholars held this way, including the Torah Temimah.</p>
<p><strong>II. An Important R&#8217;osh</strong></p>
<p>Chazal famously say that Yocheved was born between the walls of Egypt. They say this to explain a problem in the text. That is, the verse says that 70 people went with Yaakov to Egypt. The problem is that if you count the people mentioned in the Torah, it&#8217;s only 69 people and the Torah doesn&#8217;t mention her name because she was only a fetus. The Talmud even provides some textual support for this interpretation. The verse merely says that Yocheved was <em>born </em>in Egypt (Numbers 26:59), so we can infer that she was not conceived in Egypt.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah alerts us to a comment of the R&#8221;osh (Rabeinu Asher) at the end of Mesechta Pesachim §40. Some of the rishonim are bothered by the fact that the Torah says that we should count 50 days from Pesach to Shavuos and a different verse says to count seven complete weeks (49 days). The R&#8221;osh quotes some weak answers to this question and then drops the bomb. Says the R&#8221;osh: <i>There is no question here because the way of Scripture is when it gets to a round number minus one, Scripture uses the round number and it ignores the lower number. Similarly, we find the count of Yaakov&#8217;s family to be 70 (and another example).</i></p>
<p>This is huge. It is presumed by almost every serious orthodox Jew and most of the commentaries that every word in the Torah is absolutely precise and true. The R&#8221;osh obviously would agree. However, he has opened a door here. He is saying that the Torah is sometimes imprecise &#8211; specifically with regard to numbers. Would this also apply to a number like 600,000? Maybe. Maybe not. Is this an extension of <em>dibra Torah kilshon bnei adam? </em>Maybe.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah asks several good questions to poke holes in this R&#8221;osh. The gist of his attack is that Chazal and the Rishonim all took the numbers in the Torah to be precise so how could the R&#8221;osh disagree? So it&#8217;s unclear if the Torah Temimah likes this R&#8221;osh or not. But I like it either way.</p>

Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Learn With Your Children</h2>
<p>After Yosef reveals himself to his brothers he sends them home to tell their father that he is still alive and to please come join him in Mitzrayim. The brothers hasten to their father and exclaim <i>od Yosef chai vchi hu mosheil b’chol Eretz Mitzrayim </i>- Yosef still lives and he is the ruler over all of Egypt. The Torah continues, <i>vayafag libo ki lo he&#8217;emin lahem </i>- Yakov&#8217;s heart fluttered because he did not believe them. However, when the brothers continued to tell their story, and Yakov saw the <i>agalos &#8211; </i>the wagons that Yosef sent to carry him down to Egypt the Pasuk tells us: <i>vat’chi ruach Yaakov Avihem </i>– Yaakov’s spirit was revived and invigorated. He was so much <i>b’simcha</i> that he was even ready for <i>nevuah</i>.</p>
<p>One cannot help but wonder, why didn’t Yaakov believe the <em>Shevatim</em> from the moment they reported the momentous news of Yosef’s survival? And why did the <i>agalos</i> revive Yaakov’s spirit?<span id="more-6659"></span> Lev Eliyahu explains that Yakov Avinu, upon hearing the declaration of his 11 sons – including Binyamin, had no doubt that Yosef was physically alive. What he could not believe was that <i>od Yosef </i><b><i>Chai</i></b>- that the spiritual essence of Yosef <b><i>Hatzadik</i></b> had survived after so many years away from his father and his family. Could the leader of Egypt be a frum Jew? Couldn’t be, thought Yaakov Avinu. After all, one cannot ascend to such a powerful position without a compromise of religious values and practice. Though he was happy to hear the news that Yosef was still physically alive, <i>vayafeg libo</i> Yaakov’s felt faint. He now feared not the loss of Yosef but of Yosef <i>Hatzadik!</i> His soul shuddered at the thought that his righteous son had been corrupted by the depravity of Egyptian society. The brothers tried to convince Yakov otherwise, but Yakov would not accept it. To Yakov it was impossible—until he saw the wagons that Yosef sent for him.</p>
<p>Chazal tell us that Yosef sent <i>Agalos</i> to hint to his father of the topic they had been studying 22 years earlier, the laws of <i>Egla Arufa</i>. Yosef anticipated his father&#8217;s concern and knew that if he could demonstrate to his father that he was still immersed in Torah, his father wouldn&#8217;t be disappointed, nor would he suspect that Yosef had <i>chas v’shalom</i> deviated from the Torah&#8217;s way. Indeed, as a result, <i>vat’chi ruach Yaakov Avihem</i>. Yaakov’s spirit was rejuvinated.</p>
<p>We learn from this a powerful message of how one should never underestimate nor diminish the importance of parents and children learning together. Even after twenty-two years it was the bond of Talmud Torah between father and son that gave life meaning to both Yakov and Yosef. It is a bond that lasts forever and it is never too late to start!</p>

<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Yaakov’s Shlomim</h2>
<p>Following the dramatic news of Yosef Hatzaddik’s survival in the flesh pots of Mitzrayim, Yaakov Avinu readies himself to visit his long lost son. With vigor and alacrity he packs his bags. Taking his entire family and all of his possessions in tow he head towards Be’er Sheva. Why Be’er Sheva? Chazal explain, it was years earlier that, “<em>vayeitzei Yaakov miBe’er Sheva</em>,” that Yaakov’s life travail from Lavan to Yosef commenced upon his departure from Beer Sheva. Now that his life had come full circle he went back to Be’er Sheva, to offer thanks to Hashem Yisborach in a <em>makom Tefilah</em> of his fathers, the place where it all began.</p>
<p>Energized with a renewed sense of <em>simchas hachyim,</em> Yaakov Avinu arrives in Be’er Sheva and immediately brings a <em>korban</em> of thanks to the <em>Ribbono Shel Olam</em>. However, unlike all <em>korbanos</em> offered heretofore, from the time of Noach and Avraham until this climactic moment, Yaakov does not bring a <em>korban Olah</em>, which is<em> kulo laHashem</em>. Rather, he offers <em>zevachim</em>, <em>shlomim</em> sacrifices. Offerings which are shared with and enjoyed by all. Interestingly, the Torah records that he offers them to the <em>Elokei</em> <em>Aviv</em> Yitzchok.</p>
<p><em>Mifarshei hamikrah</em> wonder; firstly, why <em>Shlomim</em>? Secondly, why not also mention <em>Elokei</em> Avraham as Yaakov had in the past? And finally, why wouldn’t one <em>korban</em> suffice, he obviously offered many animals (<em>zevachim</em>).<span id="more-4992"></span> One explanation provides us an extraordinary insight to golus in general and Yaakov Avinu’s persuit of <em>shlaimus</em> in particular. Perhaps it is a <em>remez</em> to the recipe for Geula as well.</p>
<p>The Ramban reminds us that Yitzchok Avinu represents <em>middas hadin</em>. He quotes the Midrash which teaches that Yaakov Avinu realized that with his impending descent to Mitzrayim the dreaded <em>golus</em> was about to begin. He feared for himself and his children. The total tragedy and devastation of the terror of golus could only be realized with the <em>middas hadin</em> (represented by Yitzchok Avinu) in full force. As such, Yaakov Avinu offered <em>shlomim</em> to the <em>Elokei Aviv Yitzchok</em>, to somehow sweeten the <em>middas hadin</em> through his offerings and thereby ensure Klal Yisrael’s ultimate survival through the darkness of golus that loomed ahead. Indeed, by being <em>matil shalom b’olam</em> with his <em>shlomim</em> offerings, the <em>middas harachamim</em> would be aroused. With H<em>akadosh Baurch Hu’s rachamim</em> ignited he could descend to Mitzrayim confident in Klal Yisrael’s future.</p>
<p>This was especially important to Yaakov Avinu who recognized that the descent of the <em>shivtei kah</em> to Mitzrayim started with the <em>kinah</em> of the brothers towards Yosef, an attitude that started with their perception of Yaakov’s playing favorite with his “<em>ben zekunim</em>.” Yaakov in his quest for <em>shlaimus</em> wanted a <em>tikkun</em> for this mistake. Thus the <em>tikkun</em> of his <em>shlomim</em> was personal and communal and he needed to offer at least two animals; one for himself and one for the <em>tzibbur</em>. Indeed, having come full circle, Yaakov wanted to be a <em>shaleim</em> thus <em>shalom</em> was priority number one.</p>
<p>This should not be lost upon us. The darkness of <em>golus</em> still engulfs us. We feel its pain in many ways. Yaakov Avinu taught us that he way to be <em>mamtik</em> the bitter days of exile is through multiple <em>shlomim</em>, creating a greater sense of harmony between each Yid and as a result between Klal Yisrael and <em>Avihem Shebashamayim</em>. The more we feel the <em>din</em> the more we need the <em>shlomim</em>. If one senses that klal Yisrael is feeling the pinch of <em>middas hadin</em> today, then Yaakov Avinu’s model should be our inspiration. We should be ambitious in being <em>marbeh shlomim</em> as <em>ohavei</em> and <em>rodfei shalom</em>! Perhaps this is one more reason why Parshas Vayigash is read immediately following the <em>chag</em> of Chanukah. With the<em> chag urim</em> just behind us we should not forget the Rambam’s concluding message of hilchos Chanukah where he states “<em>godol Hashalom shekol haTorah nitna la’asos shalom ba’olam”</em> It is Yaakov Avinu’s message to us as well. The only way to survive the dark days of golus is through being<em> marbeh shalom</em>. Let us do more. We can start today. In that zechus may we merit that the <em>oseh shalom bimromav</em> will be <em>yaaseh shalom aleinu</em> of <em>kol Yisrael bimhara biyameinu</em>, amen.</p>

<p><em><span style="color: #888888;">A guest post by Rabbi Aaron Fink (my father), Dean of Ateres Bais Yaakov on Monsey NY. Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></em></p>
<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Just Visiting</h2>
<p>The drama of the Parsha seems to reach its climax with Yosef’s revelation to his brothers. In reality, however, a message much more profound than the discovery of Yosef’s identity is being conveyed to us for eternity.</p>
<p>The inner lesson of Parshas Vayigash is Bnai Yisrael’s descent into Golus. Golus is not only about location; it is about a mindset. It is not only about where we are now, but where we are heading.</p>
<p>Avraham Avinu was told at the Bris Bein Habisarim, that his grandchildren would be strangers in a strange land. Unfortunately, as the Torah tells us at the end of the Parsha, “Vayeishvu Bnai Yisrael—Bnai Yisrael settled into Egypt”. Not content with being “strangers”, they made Mitzrayim home.<span id="more-3448"></span> They became active citizens of Egypt. Indeed, as the Bnai Yaakov took up residence in the land of Goshen they took it all in. They blended with the prevalent culture and adapted to the mores of Egyptian civilization. As they grew from an immigrant population of a mere seventy households they adopted Egyptian customs and made them their own. Their homes became indistinguishable in some ways from their Egyptian counterparts. They were living the “Egyptian dream”. As a result, Klal Yisrael suffered through the shibud Mitzrayim  (the bondage of Mitzrayim) instead of passing through it with relative ease. Despite the efforts of Yaakov Avinu, who charged Yehuda with the mission of establishing a Yeshiva and a building a Torah communal infrastructure, the Golus came fast and easy. Why? The answer, the Kli Yakar explains, is found in the last posuk of the Parsha where we are told that not only did Klal Yisrael settle into Egypt— vayeiachzu bah!  they took hold of it with gusto.</p>
<p>This is a valuable reminder to us. Chazal tell us that the geula ha’asida, the final redemption, will parallel the Geulas Mitzrayim. We need to work on redefining our status to be sure we conduct ourselves as mere visitors by keeping the current Golus out of our heart and out of our home. Then we and our families will IY”H pass through the Malchus shel Chesed called “America” intact. Indeed, Mashiach awaits us. We need to be ready for his call.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h1>The Fall into Exile</h1>
<p>The drama of the parsha seems to reach its climax with Yosef’s revelation to his brothers. In reality, however, a message and pattern of events much more profound than the discovery of Yosef’s identity is being conveyed to us for eternity. Indeed, the inner lesson of parshas Vayigash is really Bnai Yisrael’s descent into golus. To emerge into a state of geula we must heed its lesson and learn how to undo the damage and prepare ourselves for redemption. Let us explore further.<span id="more-1942"></span></p>
<p>Chazal teach us that golus is not only about location; it is about a mindset. It is not only about where we are now, but where we are heading. Avraham Avinu was told at the Bris Bein Habisarim, that ger yihyeh zarecha b’eretz lo lahem, his offspring would be strangers in a strange land. However, the text of the parsha at the end of Vayigash is slightly different. The Torah tells us, “vayeishvu bnai Yisrael b&#8217;eretz Mitzrayim” Bnai Yisrael settled into Egypt.” Not content with being “geirim—strangers,” they made Mitzrayim home. They became active and contributing citizens of Egypt. Indeed, as the Bnai Yaakov took up residence in the land of Goshen they took it all in. They blended with the prevalent culture and adapted to the mores of Egyptian civilization. As they grew from an immigrant population of a mere seventy households they adopted Egyptian customs and made them their own. Their homes became indistinguishable in some ways from their Egyptian counterparts. They were living the “Egyptian dream.” Sadly, as a result, Bnai Yisrael absorbed the decadent, permissive and immoral values of their society. No one was safe from the spiritual assault. The bigger we were the harder and deeper we fell. And, we accepted our spiraling descent into the debauchery of Mitzrayim as “normal.” We would rationalize our degenerate behavior with a shrug-of-the-shoulders “stuff happens” attitude. What a mistake.</p>
<p>As a result, Klal Yisrael suffered through the horrific shibud Mitztrayim (the bondage of Mitzrayim) instead of passing through it with relative ease. Despite the efforts of Yaakov Avinu, who charged Yehuda with the mission of establishing a Yeshiva and a building a Torah communal infrastructure, the golus came fast and easy. Why? The answer, the Kli Yakar explains, is found in the last posuk of the parsha where we are told that not only did Klal Yisrael settle into Egypt—vaye&#8217;achzu bah—they took hold of it with gusto.</p>
<p>This is a valuable reminder to us. We, too, can r”l find ourselves captivated and captured by the green grasses of our golus.  Chazal tell us that the geula ha’asida, the final redemption, will parallel the geulas Mitzrayim. We need to work on redefining our status to be sure we conduct ourselves as mere visitors in this society and not G-d forbid part and parcel of its downgraded standards. By keeping the current golus out of our heart and out of our home. Then we and our families will iy”H pass through the Malchus shel chesed called “America” intact. Indeed, Mashiach awaits us. We need to be ready for his call.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Thank you to community member Milton Simon for editing these Shabbos speeches given at the Pacific Jewish Center from my notes into <a href="http://finkorswim.com/category/shabbos-on-the-beach/" target="_blank">these</a> essays.</strong></em></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">Today we are going to talk about truth. We will also discuss the opposite of truth. What is the opposite of truth? Something is true when it is in accordance with the facts and reality. The opposite of truth is when something is not in accordance with the facts and reality. Let us keep these definitions in mind as we progress.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">As we jump back into the Parsha story we head to end of the Parsha. We have just experienced the most dramatic and moving section of all of Torah and perhaps in all of history. Yosef has revealed himself to his brothers. Yosef forgives his brothers. Yosef tells his brothers it was all part of a master plan and it is water under the bridge. The brothers are then invited to join Yosef and his family in Egypt to avoid the famine (and bring the fulfillment of the prophecy that the Jewish people would be slaves in Egypt.)</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">We can imagine the good spirits the brothers were in as they returned to their father in Israel. When they left him last they were on the verge of tragedy. One brother was in jail, the entire family was threatened and all this was aside from the gnawing guilt the brothers most certainly felt every day of their lives, imagining their lying to their father caused him massive suffering. They saw their father wither away and lose his spark due to their actions and lies. Now the brothers have their chance at redemption. They see that it was all part of a plan! They are forgiven! Yosef wants them to move to Egypt! We can only imagine their elation as they journeyed back to Yaakov their father.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The psukim tell us what happened when the brothers reached Yaakov. This should be another climactic scene. If we could imagine a movie about when the brothers tell Yaakov the news, the music would swell while the camera goes in real close to capture Yaakov’s unbridled joy. As Yaakov would hear the news the room would brighten, years of sadness would melt off Yaakov’s face as he would stand up from his seat and the scene would slowly fade to black. Well let’s see how it really happened. In fact, Yaakov didn’t believe them!!</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">What? Yaakov did not believe his sons. Did he think they playing a practical joke on him? Couldn’t he see their genuine joy? How are we to understand this?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">Let us continue in the Chumash. Amazingly we see that eventually Yaakov believed that Yosef was alive. What convinced him? How did the truth become evident?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">R’ Schwab mentions the saying in Avos of R’ Shimon. “The punishment of the liar is that even when he tells the truth no one listens to him” and we see from the brothers of Yosef that when they lied to their father by telling him that Yosef was dead they were not believed when they tried to tell their father that Yosef was alive.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">At this point the Shevatim understood that by covering their misdeeds they would NEVER succeed, even with the truth. Therefore they realized their only option is to now tell Yaakov the entire story. They decided to tell their father all about their jealousy and plots to kill Yosef. The eventual sale of Yosef was discussed and they asked for forgiveness from Yaakov. That is what is meant by they told Yaakov ALL about Yosef – es Kol divrei Yosef. The full truth was finally revealed. At that point Yaakov was able to believe his sons and see the truth.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The truth is not only that the words are true. Truth is consistent with all the facts and reality. Truth does not exist in a vacuum – it is part of a greater whole. It must fit in with the song of the universe and be in perfect harmony with all the other parts. Yaakov was on too great a spiritual level to be a piece of the truth. He needed all of it to complete the circle of truth of reality.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The Talmud teaches us that Emes – truth stand on its own. And sheker – the opposite of truth always falls. We can visualize this by looking at the letters that form the word Emes and the letters that form the word Sheker. Emes is Aleph, Mem, Taf. These are the first, last and middle letters of the Aleph Beis. Truth is from start to finish with a solid middle. This is consistent with what we are saying that truth is part of a greater whole of reality and not independent. Perhaps even more interesting is the formation of each letter. The Aleph has two legs to stand on, the mem has a base on its bottom and the taf has a base as well as two legs. If we would stand these letters up they would not fall. Let’s look at Sheker. Shin, kuf and reish. Those letters all have but one leg and when stood up will topple. Further these letters are “out of alphabetical order” and are all right next to each other in the aleph beis. This indicates that sheker can work for a time because it is kept close and private but once the sheker gets out it cannot stand on its own.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">Our Torah world is predicated on Emes. The Torah is emes and stands on its own. We don’t need to make excuses for Torah and it stands the test of time.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The lesson of Yaakov in this week’s parsha is that sheker is hard to undo – we can’t just press control z and magically the sheker disappears. Sheker can stand for a little while but eventually it gets toppled. This is why we need to be so careful to always begin with the absolute emes. It can be very difficult to undo sheker as we saw with Yaakov.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">What was are witnessing in the world right now as Israel rains attacks upon its enemies is frightening. When the world is so immersed in sheker the truth is very hard to find. But the truth stands on its own and will eventually be seen. We need to do our part as advocates for Israel and prevent lies from spreading. I say this not because I am concerned with international opinion and political clout – rather I say this because when Jews look bad it reflects upon GD and it is very important to me to help prevent further Chillul Hashem. We can do our part as advocates for Israel.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">But why are these lies so easy to spread? Shouldn’t the truth be obvious?</span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;"><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The last point I want to make is that while we do 100% back our brothers and sisters in Israel we also recognize there is a flaw in their reality. The official line of the Government of Israel is not that Hashem put the land of Israel in our hands, they say WE DID IT OURSELVES. Is it any wonder the world disbelieves our stories about the war, or anything?</span></span><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;"> </span></span></span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">The world KNOWS the truth, and disbelieves us when we hold sheker. Amazing!</span></span><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;"> </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-weight:normal;"><span style="font-style:normal;">Is our leadership in the land of Israel taking all of reality into the equation? Do they recognize the role that GD plays in their lives? So long as they do not have the complete truth, with all its realities and all its beauty – the world will not see that the truth is with us. As we saw with Yaakov – only the whole truth is recognized as the truth. The only time a truth is recognizable to all and stands on it own is when the truth is consistent and the truth is in sync with the realities of the universe. When the truth is part of the harmony of the world then everyone will see it. When our leadership in the land of Israel embraces the spiritual component to the land of Israel the tremendous amount of Torah that spouts from the land of Israel, when the message of truth is consistent with all the facts and realities – that GD gave us this land – he should have a say as to how we use it, when that message is clear – the truth will be unequivocal and unchallenged.</span></span></span></p>
