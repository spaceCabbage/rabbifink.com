I sidestepped the question on the radio but these are my thoughts.</em></p>
<p>Rosh Chodesh is supposed to be a day of renewal for the Jewish people and a special day in recognition of Jewish women. This past Rosh Chodesh at the Kotel women engaged in a fierce turf war.</p>
<p>For several years the Women of the Wall have held their Rosh Chodesh service at the Kotel. They wear prayer shawls, some wear tefillin, and they read from the Torah. This violated the rules of the Kotel and arrests were routinely made. The Israel courts determined that these rules were illegal and the Women of the Wall looked forward to a peaceful service, finally. But it was not to be. A new group called the Woman for the Wall who support traditional orthodox Judaism and oppose the Women of the Wall organized a huge counter protest.<span id="more-7075"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times reports:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Heeding calls from their rabbis, religious teenage girls turned up in large numbers to protest the group’s insistence on praying at the wall in religious garb traditionally worn by men. The girls crammed the women’s section directly in front of the wall by 6:30 a.m., forcing the liberal women to conduct their prayer service farther back on the plaza. There, hundreds of police officers locked arms in cordons to hold back throngs of black-hatted Orthodox men who whistled, catcalled, and threw water, candy and a few plastic chairs.</em></p>
<p>There were thousands of people there. I am sure that most of them were well behaved. I am sure that only a few of them contributed to the mayhem. But I am also sure that some people made fools out of themselves and a few even got arrested.</p>
<p>At this point, the issue of Women and the Wall has been so needlessly escalated that it seems unlikely a resolution will be reached. When I think about what has happened over the last few months I feel sad. I feel sad because this didn&#8217;t have to happen. Most of this is senseless outrage and manufactured controversy.</p>
<p>Go back a few months. Imagine the Kotel authority just looked the other way when a small group of women prayed in a different way than the other women. The Women of the Wall were not proselytizing, they were not trying to win converts, they were not trying to make a revolution at the Kotel. They just wanted to pray the way they like to pray. Is it the way orthodox Jewish women pray? Not usually. Is it halachically acceptable? Barely. But there is definitely room to allow it. The Women of the Wall would be a small blip on the Kotel radar as they have been for several years now. Especially now that the court sided in their favor, this Rosh Chodesh would have passed with little fanfare. The Women of the Wall would have done their thing without threat of arrest and no one would have been in the news or in jail.</p>
<p>Instead a massive counter protest was manufactured. Not too many people seemed bothered by the small group of Women of the Wall. No one really felt so outraged that they needed to do something about it. People noticed, or didn&#8217;t notice, and that was it. No big deal. Until last week. Until people were told to care, they didn&#8217;t. As was appropriate.</p>
<p>The organizers tapped into the two things that are guaranteed to draw big numbers: Daas Torah and paranoia about non-orthodox Jews. The rabbis said to go protest and so they went to protest. The pretext for the protest was that the Women of the Wall were out to uproot the sanctity of the Kotel and over time they were out to erode the very essence of orthodox Judaism. If that sounds crazy, it&#8217;s because it is. How can a few dozen women carry so much power? Why do the ultra-orthodox even care what they are doing? I don&#8217;t have the answer to that question and I have yet to see a satisfactory answer from anyone else.</p>
<p>They should have been left alone. Instead, thousands of people came to the Kotel on Friday and turned it into a battleground. And for what? Is there really any legitimate fear that charedi Judaism is in danger of being subverted by a few dozen women? Are we so paranoid, so insecure about our <em>frumkeit?</em> Is seeing some women praying in non-traditional ways such a danger?</p>
<p>The part that hurts me the most is that these women are not sinning, they are praying! While many may not agree with the manner in which they are praying, it boggles the mind that orthodox Jews would stifle prayer at the Kotel or anywhere for that matter. If we really believe that prayer is a mitzvah, and praying brings us closer to God, why would we deny others the same opportunity?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like the Women of the Wall are fornicating, <em>chas v&#8217;shalom, </em>at the Kotel. They are praying. We should be encouraging them. We should be impressed with their dedication to their prayers. We should be taking note that non-orthodox Jews can also be religious. Instead we are scared of them and their ideas. We let our fear turn into hate and violence. Our public statement to the world is that we cannot allow anyone to pray in a way that makes us a tad uncomfortable. In the end, I think this says a lot more about us than it says about them.</p>
<p>It is sad that it has come to this. Jew against Jew. One groups seeking the right to pray and the other doing their best to stop them. The script has been flipped. This is not a proud moment for us.</p>
<p>Tensions are high. Anger and rhetoric is escalating. I hope we can find within ourselves to cool off a bit, take a step back, and try to find common ground with the Women of the Wall. Maybe we can even see that it&#8217;s possible that God is smiling, <em>k&#8217;vyachol,</em> over these women who may not be as orthodox as some of us, but are yearning to connect to Him in the best way that they know how.</p>
