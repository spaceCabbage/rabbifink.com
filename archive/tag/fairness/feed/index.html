Every post I feel like writing is connected with parenting.</p>
<p>The last time this happened I was hooked on <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/clothing/" target="_blank">clothes</a>. Those posts are all linked <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/24/mesillas-yesharim-052409/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/03/the-clothes-make-or-break-the-man-connections-2209/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/05/clothing-round-up/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/13/clothes-in-the-nba/" target="_blank">here</a>. I recommend checking those out.</p>
<p>One of the most popular articles on NYTimes.com this week is an Op-Ed about women&#8217;s happiness.</p>
<p>Cleverly titled &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/opinion/20dowd.html?_r=1&amp;em" target="_blank">Blue is the New Black</a>&#8220;, the article&#8217;s basic premise is that women having more opportunities and doing more does not contribute to their happiness.<span id="more-1235"></span></p>
<p>Some of the money quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Women around the world are in a funk&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Though women begin their lives more fulfilled than men, as they age, they gradually become less happy&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Choice is inherently stressful&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a bit of an issue with &#8220;Happiness Surveys&#8221; in general, especially across time and space. We all have different definitions of happiness and I find it hard to believe that there is a universal definition that can be compared across 40 years of women.</p>
<p>What disturbed me even more was this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Across the happiness data, the one thing in life that will make you less happy is having children. It’s true whether you’re wealthy or poor, if you have kids late or kids early. Yet I know very few people who would tell me they wish they hadn’t had kids or who would tell me they feel their kids were the destroyer of their happiness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Children are a lot of work. Children take up a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of money. But I cannot fathom how people can have such a negative outlook on the effect of children on their lives.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that when one has no children they have more free time. Is free time the key ingredient to happiness in the minds of these people? What is it about children that can guarantee these people will be less happy?</p>
<p>Love is a great feeling. Loving one&#8217;s children must add good feelings to one&#8217;s life. More good feelings should help one feel more happiness. I find it shocking that these parents claim not to find more happiness in their lives.</p>
<p>Further, is happiness something that depends on external factors at all?</p>
<p>To me, happiness is a state of mind that exists irrespective of outside stimuli.</p>
<p>Even if someone is oppressed they can be happy. Even during trying times like tragedy or even Holocaust one can be happy.</p>
<p>Did women&#8217;s roles change in response to <strong>happiness</strong>? I think they changed in deference to <strong>fairness</strong>. In which case the entire article is meaningless. The happiness of women or anyone else was never the issue.</p>
<p>Ms. Dowd makes the issue &#8220;happiness&#8221; and then says &#8220;it didn&#8217;t work&#8221;. Color me confused. Blue or black&#8230;</p>
