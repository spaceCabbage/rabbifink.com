				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Today I am asking my readers to <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/8f7499b69c08" target="_blank">head over to Medium.com where I published an article criticizing Slate</a> for their irresponsible reporting on a sensationalist and false story about Gur banning soy because it can make you gay. The story is not true. It was originally reported with no sources or evidence on YourJewishNews.com, a site with no credibility.<span id="more-7764"></span><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/oh_no_you_di_int_retro_housewife_b_w_tshirt-d23504043240443180228y9d_325.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7766" alt="oh_no_you_di_int_retro_housewife_b_w_tshirt-d23504043240443180228y9d_325" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/oh_no_you_di_int_retro_housewife_b_w_tshirt-d23504043240443180228y9d_325.jpg" width="136" height="136" /></a></p>
<p>I wrote it on Medium because of the possibility for greater exposure. Viral posts on Medium have more potential than posts on my personal blog. So head on over to Medium, read the article, click Recommend and Share on Twitter and Facebook when you&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s hope Slate publishes a retraction. And please stop reading YourJewishNews.com.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>I was invited to join Rabbi Shafran to talk about recent comments by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks and the subsequent response by the Agudah. We discussed it on Facebook on Friday and I guess Zev or one of his producers saw the comment thread and decided to ask me onto the show. The format of the show was to be a moderated discussion between Rabbi Shafran and me.<span id="more-7357"></span></p>
<p>Rabbi Shafran represented the Agudah position. I represented the non-Agudah position.<img class="size-medium wp-image-7358 alignright" alt="old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/old_radio_by_Xristoforos_01-600x399.jpg" width="600" height="399" /></p>
<p>The gist of Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s argument was that Rabbi Sacks was criticizing a legitimate form of orthodox Judaism and was doing so from a place of ignorance as evidenced by his mention of the Siyum HaShas as an example of inward turning segregationism. Thus, the Agudah was standing up for themselves and the more insular communities who were criticized.</p>
<p>My opinion is that the Agudah over reacted. Rabbi Sacks was not even criticizing the insular communities as much as he was warning of a potential danger if the trend to the right continues. In his view, and in mine, there is a lot of value in a version of Judaism that sympathizes with orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Judaism should be careful not to eliminate this soft center between non-orthodox Judaism and orthodox Judaism. While the choice of the Siyum HaShas was unfortunate, I don&#8217;t think it accurately reflected his sentiments.</p>
<p>Regardless of what Rabbi Sacks meant, this is an important discussion and I invited Rabbi Shafran and the radio audience to have that discussion. While it is entertaining to argue about what Rabbi Sacks was trying to say, it is far less important than the substance his point.</p>
<p>Listen to the show below. I&#8217;ve cut the 2 hour show into 1:20 of just talking. So no ads or news will disturb your listening. The quality of the recording is pretty brutal but this was what I received from the producer.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7319" alt="images" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images.jpeg" width="275" height="183" /></a>The USA Today reports that there are some orthodox Jews who will watch fireworks tonight with no sound. Seeing as this year the 4th of July is during the 3 Weeks between Shiva Asar B&#8217;Tamuz and Tisha B&#8217;Av there are some elements of mourning that are customary during this period. Many orthodox Jews refrain from listening to music as part of their mourning these 3 weeks.</p>
<p>Fireworks are often accompanied by music. Journalist Menachem Wecker was curious if the music accompaniment would cause some orthodox Jews to forgo the usual fireworks celebrations.</p>
<p>There are probably very few orthodox Jews who care about July 4th who also would be so stringent about the 3 weeks that they would not even listen to background music. Of those who are that stringent, very few would care to participate in July 4th festivities.<span id="more-7318"></span></p>
<p>Are there any orthodox Jews who will avoid places that have music in the background? What do they do if they get put on hold? Radio advertisement jingles? Cell phone ring tones? Singing toddler toys? That <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQT9K_nkeVQ" target="_blank">awesome music that plays when you start Windows 2000</a>? Obviously these questions are absurd. The real prohibition is against live music and celebration. Most orthodox Jews extend that to recored music as well. But I don&#8217;t think there are many people who avoid music at all costs.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I told Menachem Wecker when he talked with me about this issue and then I was quoted in his article.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the headline though. It kind of says the opposite of what the article says.</p>
<p>Most importantly though, if a July 4th celebration would interfere with one&#8217;s observance of the appropriate level of mourning at this time of year, I think one should make their own decision to refrain from celebrating. I don&#8217;t that would apply to many people, but out first allegiance is to Torah, then and only then do we pledge allegiance to the flag.</p>
<p>Enjoy the holiday. Happy birthday America!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6945" alt="130415160947-boston-marathon-explosion-08-horizontal-large-gallery" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/130415160947-boston-marathon-explosion-08-horizontal-large-gallery-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" />Yesterday, on Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101489314937755" target="_blank">I posted the iconic photo of the 78 year old man</a> in an orange shirt surrounded by police officers with smoke billowing in the background just after the explosion at the Boston Marathon. I took notice of the Israeli flag in the background. It was hard to miss the flag through the smoke and it meant something to me that the flag was so prominent in the photo.</p>
<p>One fellow left a comment on the photo with a link to a CNN version of the photo. In the CNN version the Israeli flag cannot be seen. The implication was that the photo was edited to remove the Israeli flag.</p>
<p>I did a little digging and I discovered that CNN got the photo from Getty Images. I hunted for the photo on Getty Images and found the second photo on their site. At first I was incensed. I even put up a blog post criticizing Getty Images (completely against my nature) for what I thought was scrubbing the photo.</p>
<p>I never looked at the photos side by side. I last saw the original photo last night and I first saw the second photo this morning. They were similar enough that it looked suspicious. But once I posted the photos one above the other I noticed, as did several intrepid readers, that they were <em>not the same photo.</em> The photographer took more than one photo as he got closer to the scene. In one photo the Israeli flag is visible, in the other it is not. But in the second photo, the American flag is visible. That&#8217;s clearly a better choice for this particular tragedy.</p>
<p>Once I realized my mistake I removed the blog post.<span id="more-6951"></span> This despite the fact that I can guarantee that post would have reached 50,000 views within a couple hours. The conspiracy theorists would have loved and shared it to all their fellow conspiracy theorist friends and the realists would have come to see the post and yell at me (and them). But it&#8217;s not about views. It&#8217;s about truth and honest discussion. So I took it down.</p>
<p>Of course, there are people who will try to make this all about Israel and media bias. I almost did too. But if it&#8217;s simply not true. These people will post cropped versions of the photos to make them look like the same photo. Shame on them. It is irresponsible, whiny, and even dangerous to invent media conspiracies against Israel.</p>
<p>However, there are some media outlets that used the original photo but cropped all the flags out of the photo. I think that is acceptable. The flags are cool, but distract from the important part of the photo.</p>
<p>Today is Yom HaAztmaut. We should be celebrating Israel, not complaining about manufactured controversies. I apologize for almost jumping on this bandwagon. I am glad I got off right away.</p>
<p>Here is a PDF of my original post that has been taken down: <em>(It&#8217;s fairly obvious that these are two different photos)</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6623" alt="newspaper_press" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/newspaper_press-288x300.jpg" width="288" height="300" />Now that the Weberman trial is behind us we can reflect on the reactions from within and outside the community. Specifically we need to to analyze the role of the media, secular and religious.</p>
<p>The New York media reported the Weberman case. I found their reporting to be pretty fair. They did not prejudge, they did not take sides, and they mostly followed typical conventions for cases like this one. CNN (national media) also reported on the guilty verdict. They went a bit more big picture including a Deborah Feldman sound bite about the Va&#8217;ad Hatznius. It was a very fair and informative segment.</p>
<p>The Jews News sites (YWN / VIN / Matzav) are an interesting case study too. As far as Matzav and YWN are concerned there was no Weberman trial. The man doesn&#8217;t exist. The victim doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s literally like an ostrich digging its head into the sand.</p>
<p>VIN reported extensively on the trial. The comments are predictably erratic. But the site did a good job keeping their readers informed.</p>
<p>I find it disgraceful that two of the three largest Jews News site ignored the trial for reasons that will become apparent shortly.</p>
<p><span id="more-6622"></span></p>
<p>The bloggers all talked about the trial. A few defended Weberman, most did not.</p>
<p>There are some people who take issue with the way the media handled this case and the way Satmar was covered. On Zev Brenner&#8217;s Talkline, Yossi Gestetner was on the line for about an hour complaining about the media coverage. Others on Twitter and Facebook have attacked Oren Yaniv of the Daily News and Rabbi Horowitz for not balancing their talk about Satmar&#8217;s role in this crime with effusive praise for the chessed in Satmar.</p>
<p>Rabbi Horowitz responded on Twitter with some very important points which I think must be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li>He compares this complaint to A-Rod complaining that when the media talks about his poor post-season effort this year they neglect to mention his charity work.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an apt comparison. The news is not about judgment or portraying a group or individual. It is about the news. And the news is that A-Rod stunk in the playoffs. The news is not that he has a charity. Nor does his charity work mitigate his failure to perform under pressure. It&#8217;s not only completely irrelevant, it detracts from the real story.</p>
<ul>
<li>The press has an important role in keeping society in check. This is why freedom of the press is vital in any free and just society.</li>
</ul>
<p>The news outlets must be able to report on abuses of power and miscarriages of justice. They serve as a deterrent and more importantly, they empower the public to withstand tyranny. If the message is completely controlled by the powerful entities in any society there is no chance for freedom. The press have the right and ability to keep the public informed and tell leadership that the public does not approve of bad behavior.</p>
<p>A good society needs a good press to report on the injustices and pain within their society. It cannot be treason to say something negative about one&#8217;s society. It is the only way to effect change.</p>
<p>Ignoring &#8220;bad news&#8221; in the frum media is a complicit form of tyranny. It tells leaders that we don&#8217;t care about corruption or destructive behavior. This enables them to continue their reign of terror on the public.</p>
<ul>
<li>The next point is that there is a strong level of violence or threat of violence to those reporters and to Rabbi Horowitz.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the ultimate indicator of a rotten core. Shooting the messenger or even just ignoring the messenger is a terrible tactic for fixing real problems. The chessed of Satmar is irrelevant to keeping our children safe. It is irrelevant to the news. But threats of violence and actual violence toward those trying to change things is part of the story. It tells the world that we care more about our reputation than our children. Rabbi Horowitz has had to protect his Twitter account and make it private (you can request to follow him, but otherwise he is hidden) because of all the attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, the lack of change in the community is inexcusable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are they not clamoring for education on sex abuse? Why are they not desperate to protect their children? And why is the leadership not giving them this education? What purpose can it serve to keep their community ignorant of the signs of abuse and the horrors of its effects? Why has there never been a &#8220;Children&#8217;s Safety&#8221; event in Satmar? At the very least, why are they not giving their community the tools to be honest with their children about this case?</p>
<p><strong>To that end, Rabbi Horowitz is hosting a teleconference this evening. Click here: <a href="http://www.rabbihorowitz.com/PYes/ArticleDetails.cfm?Book_ID=1658&amp;ThisGroup_ID=238&amp;Type=Article&amp;SID=2">Project YES Teleconference</a></strong>. Get the word out and get on the phone. Anyone who wants to listen in can call in. Mother, fathers, teachers, rebbeim, moros, whomever. Just call in. Get educated. Spread the message. We will not tolerate this violence in our communities. We all play a role. Rabbis, activists, parents, the press, and everyone else. Demand that the frum press cover these stories and when the secular media reports on our flaws let&#8217;s fix them, not wonder why they are not reporting on chessed. When we clean our house it will sparkle and the shine of our chessed and kindness will be obvious to everyone.</p>

<p>The segment provided some background on the nuance of opinions regarding the Asifa and managing the Internet in the orthodox Jewish home. Sadly, it was all moot, seeing as the rabbis threw down the gauntlet. But I think we&#8217;ve exhausted ourselves discussing belaboring that point.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><div id="attachment_4761" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/dear-photograph-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4761" title="dear-photograph-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/dear-photograph-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Typical &quot;Dear Photograph&quot; Submission</p></div>
<p>A little while back I posted a link to a really amazing Tumblr blog called &#8220;Dear Photograph&#8221;.</p>
<p>The idea is hard to explain but when you see it for yourself the whole thing makes perfect sense and is quite touching. Dear Photograph is a blog that posts current photos of a place with a smaller old photograph of the same place being held in the same space. So for example you would see a new photo of a home and where the front steps would be there is an old photograph of some people standing at the front steps.</p>
<p>The effect is amazing. The submissions to Dear Photograph can evoke powerful emotions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so cool that I wish I had thought of it myself. Ever since I saw the blog I wished I could do some of my own Dear Photograph submissions.</p>
<p>Apparently, Chevrolet&#8217;s marketing firm wished they had thought of it too.<span id="more-4760"></span></p>
<p>A new ad campaign marking 100 years of Chevy uses the exact same concept by placing old photographs of Chevy cars and trucks in front of present day backgrounds. The resemblance to Dear Photograph is uncanny and obvious.</p>
<p>There is no attribution to Dear Photograph. I assume that Dear Photograph was not part of the campaign. A little Googling told me that I am not the only one to notice the similarities. See this: <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/ad-day-chevrolet-135963" target="_blank">AdWeek</a> and the comments on YouTube.</p>
<p>It can be argued that the idea is not original to Dear Photograph either. I don&#8217;t know if it or if it is not. I can understand if Dear Photograph is annoyed by their idea being used by Chevy without being compensated for it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is no greater validation for an artist than know that their idea is being used in a multimillion dollar campaign for a 100 year old car company. It must feel great to see their vision on TV and being used commercially. If you think about it, 10 years ago there would have been no way for anyone not an ad executive to have their idea in a commercial. Now, Dear Photograph, a little blog has their idea in a huge commercial. Obviously, they would like to get paid, but it is a huge step forward for the &#8220;suits&#8221; to be taking ideas from bloggers!</p>
<p>Either way, Dear Photograph has gone mainstream and if you want to see Chevy&#8217;s inspiration head on over to their site. I think a Jewish / Israel centric Dear Photograph would be amazing. It would be really cool to see old photos of people in Israel at important sites superimposed over current photos of the same places.</p>
<p>Here is the Chevy ad:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/126571-gilad-shalit-release.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4740" title="126571-gilad-shalit-release" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/126571-gilad-shalit-release-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>One of the more dramatic events in my lifetime has been the recent release of Gilad Shalit. I think most Jews thought he would never go home. He was released, the price was very high and now a week later we can reflect on the deal and its ramifications.</p>
<p>Perhaps the two biggest complaints that supporters of Israel have expressed are related not to Shalit, but to the 1000+ prisoners exchanged for Shalit. These complaints are divided into two categories. One category refers to the celebrations in Gaza when the prisoners returned. They were given a hero&#8217;s welcome and treated in a way that offended many people who felt that criminals and terrorists should not be celebrated.</p>
<p>I believe this criticism is partially valid. All kinds of prisoners were released. Some were terrorists and murdereres. Others were agitators who jumped the fence or snuck into Israel without permission. They were all released together. The worst offenders were supposedly sent to other countries, not Gaza.</p>
<p>For a governing body to cheer and promote terrorism there is absolutely no justification. It is horrible and should be obvious to any reasonable person that it is bad.</p>
<p>However, I do not take issue with the celebrations of individuals who were welcomed by their families and friends with cheers and whoops of joy. I have seen hardened criminals in American court and seen the reactions of their friends and families when they are released or acquitted. It is the same. I think we can all see that friends and family can be permitted to enjoy the moment their criminal / terrorist family members return home. I do not have a problem with it all.</p>
<p>The second category of complaint refers to the equivocation of some of the media and UN leadership of Shalit and the 1000+ prisoners.<span id="more-4739"></span> A similar complaint has been lodged by some members of the Jewish community against its own members who have equated Shalit with Pollard or Rubashkin. The complaint hods that there is a moral equivalency implied when Shalit and the prisoners are compared. The video below powerfully demonstrates the issue. (Watch it after you finish reading.)</p>
<p>I agree that any moral equivalency is absurd. No normal person could think that Shalit is equal to terrorist or even to Jewish criminals.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily agree that moral equivalency between Shalit and the terrorists was as common or prevalent as some others might perceive. There is a tendency to expect certain things from media coverage. When these expectations are not met one response is to get upset or point out that the media is biased or anti-Semitic or anti-Israel. I think that perhaps the expectations are simply off.</p>
<p>The media is not reading into each and every word it says like a Talmudic passage. They are reporting and for the sake of brevity, interest, ratings, or many other factors may present a headline or story from which something offensive can be inferred. In my opinion this is a useless exercise.</p>
<p>Take the primary example in the video below. The SkyNet reporter segues from the Shalit story to the &#8220;human element&#8221; of the released prisoners. Somehow this is deemed horribly offensive. I just don&#8217;t see it. There is no implied moral equivalency. What is being said is simply what was remarked above. There <em>is </em>a human element when hundreds of people who have been locked up come home. Isn&#8217;t there? So why the outrage?</p>
<p>I prefer to reserve my outrage for the actual words and acts of the despicable terrorists you laugh and giggle when told how many people they have killed. Sick.</p>
<p>Enjoy the video below.</p>

<p>Unlike some other bloggers, I have actually read the article, not just the excerpt or the headline.</p>
<p>It is an unfortunate title for an article. Unfortunate because it has set off a firestorm of condemnation and consternation from Israel lovers everywhere. But even more unfortunate because the title is betrayed by the actual article.</p>
<p>The article is not about why Israel doesn&#8217;t care about peace. The article is about why Israeli citizens are not obsessed with peace.</p>
<p>And that is a compliment.</p>
<p>That is a good thing.<span id="more-2820"></span></p>
<p>The article blames the Palestinian leadership for failing to agree to several peace deals. The moderate Palestinians are praised but the article does not express hope that they will survive. The article justifies the &#8220;Wall&#8221; as a necessary security measure and the Gaza Incursion as a necessary military operation. These two controversial moves have borne fruit &#8211; no suicide attacks in over 2 years and until the August 31 shooting that killed 4 people, no deaths of more than 2 people from any attack in over 2 years. In short, Israel has succesfully quashed the insurgance of violence that began with the second intifada.</p>
<p>What has happened as a result of the relative peace in Israel? Israelis have been industrious. They have been working hard and accumulating wealth. They have been inventing things and contributing to the world economy. They have been building families, taking vacations and enjoying life. They have been acting as if they don&#8217;t live in a war-zone because for the last few years they haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The article indicates that Israelis are happy with the way things are. And they should be.</p>
<p>The article assumes that if there were a peace partner that was willing to recognize Israel as a State and provide the same types of freedoms as Israel provides there would be more talk about peace. But as it stands now, Palestinians are led by politicians who don&#8217;t want to negotiate with Israel seriously and since the violence is under control, there is no reason to discuss anything.</p>
<p>The article concludes the Palestinian issue by saying that Palestinians need to make themselves heard again. How? With violence? Absolutely not. By giving a voice to the moderates who want to talk to Israel. Who can argue with that?</p>
<p>There is no mention of a &#8220;Humanitarian Crisis&#8221; in Gaza. There is no mention of &#8220;War Crimes&#8221;. There is no mention of &#8220;Disproportionate Response&#8221;. No mention of &#8220;Illegal Settlements&#8221;. The article is favorable to Israel. No question about it.</p>
<p>I have two and a half minor gripes with the article.</p>
<p>1) The article kind of glosses over the rocket attacks. Those are not negligible and the fear of attack is worth noting.</p>
<p>2) The article says almost no Palestinians are allowed into Israel. As far as I know that is inaccurate.</p>
<p>3) (only half a gripe) The title is provocative &#8211; but then again, headlines are meant to grab attention. This one grabbed everyone&#8217;s attention. So maybe it was a good title.</p>
<p>But I have two major gripes with Israel friends who lambasted the article.</p>
<p>1) I always hear from Zionist friends that &#8220;It is so good here&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s more dangerous in America&#8221;, &#8220;The economy is booming&#8221;, &#8220;Israel is a Western State&#8221;, etc. And now, Time Magazine is reporting that yes, Israel is in fact a peaceful, productive place and somehow that is not allowed?! Talk about &#8220;Double Standard&#8221;.</p>
<p>2) People should just read the darn thing before complaining about it! There are times where Israel is treated poorly in the court of popular opinion. This is NOT one of those times! We lose credibility if we cry &#8220;Wolf&#8221; any time we can sniff a trace of anti-Israel sentiment. Here, you&#8217;ll need to sniff extra hard.</p>

<p>Google has satelite pictures and &#8220;Street View&#8221; pictures which are (the ultimate stalking tool and) depict the view from the street. Most of the wacky Google Maps pictures are Street View pictures.</p>
<p>For a change, Gizmodo found a really cool satellite picture.</p>
<p>A crazy looking plane just above a residential street was spotted.</p>
<p>The street was Rose Avenue. The cross street was Lincoln Avenue. That is exactly where the Pacific Jewish Center Annex is located. <span id="more-2637"></span>Sure enough, the satellite photo of our annex has a crazy looking plane in the picture.</p>

<p>On Friday, my Bubby called me to tell me that I was quoted in the Baltimore Sun.</p>
<p>My math teached, Mr. Paul Miller was officially recognized by the City of Baltimore for his amazing accomplishment of teaching for 75 years, and he&#8217;s not done yet!</p>
<p>The Baltimore Sun did a nice write up and I was quoted at the end of the article.</p>
<p>They just lifted some lines from my blog post about Mr. Miller. I was not asked and they did not provide a URL. Is that okay?<span id="more-2611"></span></p>
<p>They also called me a &#8220;blogger from the Pacific Jewish Center&#8221;. Yes, I do have a blog, but is that a better credential than rabbi? Wait, do bloggers get paid more or less than Rabbis?</p>
<p>HT: My Bubby and a friend from High School (fellow Mr. Miller student)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/departures.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2505" title="departures" src="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/departures.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="94" /></a>Back in November I wrote about our local PBS station, KCET, coming to visit us one morning to be part of their Departures Online Series. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/06/kcet-visits-pjc-and-interviews-me/">KCET Visits PJC and Interviews Me</a>). At the time, we were told that the project would be online in March or April. Not hearing from the producers since the interview I had a feeling that the project was dead.</p>
<p>I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I was treated to an email from producer Justin Cram that the Web Series was online and we were part of it!<span id="more-2502"></span></p>
<p>This is the second time we have been featured in a wonderful online video project. Just a few weeks ago we were featured on MSNBC.com. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/04/19/pacific-jewish-center-featured-on-msnbc-com/">Pacific Jewish Center Featured on MSNBC.com</a>)</p>
<p>The Departures project is massive. Departures is a journey around Los Angeles and into the heart and soul of the City. You could spend hours, perhaps days, discovering more and more about local Los Angeles. The series features stunning photography, interactive murals, video and a wealth of first hand information.</p>
<p>I am amazed at the quality of Departures and really recommend checking out the section on Pacific Jewish Center as well as the hundreds of other stories.</p>
<p>KCET came to visit us at morning services. I am photographed wearing my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallit" target="_blank">tallis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin" target="_blank">tefilin</a> (phylacteries), no, it is not a mohawk.</p>
<p>Gary Dalin was interviewed about the history of our Shul and he gets 3 segments and I get 2 segments. Please watch below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/israel_flag1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2055" title="CB015977" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/israel_flag-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="168" /></a>Last year, there were a large number of public incidents that shed a negative light on Jews in general and particularly on Orthodox Jews. These events were not representitive of the average Jewish person, yet their notoriety put them front and center in the media.</p>
<p>It seems that the Earthquake in Haiti has marked a reversal of negative media coverage into more positive media coverage in response to more positive actions by Jewish people.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/14/jewish-relief-efforts-for-haiti-earthquake-victims/" target="_blank">I noted last week that although the Jewish connection with Haiti is slim, there has been no shortage of Jewish efforts to aid the beleaguered people of Haiti.</a></p>
<p>It did not end with financial support.<span id="more-2047"></span> CNN has been reporting that the Israeli relief efforts were the quickest to respond and efforts were in full swing before any other country was set up. Israel was the first country with a field hospital in Haiti,  Additionaly, the Israeli relief efforts have been reported as effective and efficient by CNN and others.</p>
<p>You can see video below of CNN&#8217;s coverage.</p>
<p>I am also proud to report that my uncle made the news with his personal work on behalf of Haiti.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/47393/2010/01/20/monsey-ny-orthodox-community-leaders-meet-with-haitian-neighbors" target="_blank">Vosizneias is reporting</a> that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CD4QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRonald_Greenwald&amp;ei=YkBXS5-iC4_EsQOCuqjGBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNES7nAkD6cORVmLylE121IZ1SC1-w&amp;sig2=E4ITL5bQQh41BJxz7MDJnQ" target="_blank">Rabbi Ronald Greenwald</a> (Uncle Ronnie, to me) is spearheading a drive in many Monsey NY private Jewish schools (Yeshivas) to collect food and supplies to be delivered to Haiti. This comes on the heels of an unrelated visit to Haiti 6 weeks prior in which he was inspired to help the impoverished nation. Greenwald promised the members of the the Haitian community that he would meet with them and accompany them on a delegation to Washington if needed. That meeting was scheduled for January 19.</p>
<p>Uncle Ronnie is no stranger to projects of this nature. He has spent his entire adult life working on behalf of Jewish and non-Jewish causes. Those who know him or know of him are not surprised by this news. The only thing surprising is that some people think it is &#8220;news&#8221;. This is a typical anecdote in his accomplished life and we wish him more opportunities and more success for many years to come.</p>
