				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/history-minor.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7144" alt="history-minor" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/history-minor-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a>Conor Friedersdorf has an excellent article on theatlantic.com called &#8220;<a href="ve/2013/05/history-is-beautiful-things-made-by-people-with-ugly-ideas/276328/" target="_blank">History Is Beautiful Things Made by People With Ugly Ideas</a>&#8220;. He argues that a graduate student who refuses to sing a song written by Walt Whitman because Whitman was a racist is wrong. The song itself is not racist however its composer said some very racists things in his life.</p>
<p>Friedersdorf writes that history is full of flawed men and women who did things that we would find abhorrent today. If we disregard their accomplishments because we are looking at them through modern glasses we lose all their contributions to society. Taking this idea to the extreme, it would be akin to not performing a surgery because the person who discovered or refined the technique was a racist or a bigot. We would lose almost all modern progress if the only people from whom we accepted their ideas or inventions were perfect people.</p>
<p>Instead we must view our forebears as products of a time where things were different than they are today. Even if it was the same world, modernity is built upon the ideas of flawed people.<span id="more-7143"></span></p>
<p>Reading this, I thought about how valuable this perspective of history can be to religions in general and Judaism in particular. The greatest contributors to Judaism over our history were incredible scholars and masters of the soul. They perfected their understanding of Torah and worked on their character to be saintly as they could be. In order to truly appreciate Torah, one must be a master over one&#8217;s spirit as well. Our Torah heroes accomplished all that and more.</p>
<p>But it would be foolish to think that anything that they thought must be flawless. They were not. It would be equally foolish to dismiss all of their contributions and accomplishments simply because of those flaws or mistakes. Ideas stand on their own. The ideas of our Judaism stand on the shoulders of giants. Just because those giants were not perfect does not mean that their ideas should be rejected.</p>
<p>However, if we, like the graduate student, expect flawlessness from our leaders we will be faced with two options. Either we can reinterpret everything they did and said to reflect our expectations of perfection or we will be forced to rid ourselves of all the incredible insights and contributions because we discover that they were not perfect.</p>
<p>I know which option makes the most sense to me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/562.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6551" title="562" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/562-300x281.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" /></a>Yoram Hazony wrote a very interesting article for the NY Times Opinionator Blog. I am big fan of Yoram Hazony and I really like his original thinking.</p>
<p>In his article he attempts to address the perfection of God.</p>
<p>The familiar view to orthodox Jews today is that God is All-Knowing, All-Powerful, and All-Good. Hazony makes two primary arguments against this view. One is that it&#8217;s fairly evident Jewish thought on this has evolved. The God the Bible seems to be more limited than the God we talk about today (and have talked about for at least 2000 years). Second, there are philosophical problems with calling God &#8220;All-Everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>The great rabbis of post-Biblical Judaism have done an incredible job of interpreting the passages in the Bible that seem to limit God. Yet, even some of the medieval commentators were comfortable with an anthropomorphic God. This idea has completely fallen out of favor and is now considered heresy almost unanimously.</p>
<p>But we are less adept at dealing with the philosophical concerns of an &#8220;All-Everything&#8221; God. Here there are newer issues that arise out of a better understanding of the world. Perfect is now understood in terms of balances. It is not understood as unlimited quantities of stuff. Further, to assert perfection requires us to have a complete vision of God. We don&#8217;t. God obscures Himself and even God&#8217;s favorite prophet Moses only caught a glimpse of God from the rear.</p>
<p>So Hazony proposes that we resurrect the idea of an imperfect God.<span id="more-6550"></span> The idea is that we hope that God will deal with us faithfully and there is justice. This creates a more true relationship with a more realistic God.</p>
<p>But the reason this idea has fallen out of favor, Hazony proposes, is because philosophers and religious leaders recognize that it is much more powerful to believe in the &#8220;All-Everything&#8221; God than the imperfect God. Hazony concludes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Instead, they have preferred to speak to us of a God consisting of a series of sweeping idealizations — idealizations whose relation to the world in which we actually live is scarcely imaginable. Today, with theism rapidly losing ground across Europe and among Americans as well, we could stand to reconsider this point. Surely a more plausible conception of God couldn’t hurt.</em></p>
<p>This is the core issue of contemporary orthodox Judaism. Is plausibility and minimalism a better weapon against atheism or is mysticism and maximalism a better tool? The ultra-orthodox camp firmly believes that the key is insularity and an expansion of required beliefs. It asks that their adherents shield themselves from the outside world and empirical evidence. The more progressive orthodox groups embrace the challenges of modernity by looking for less familiar views on God and Judaism that are more compatible with modern thinking. It asks their adherents to work through any potential conflict and accept scientific inquiry and some of its conclusions.</p>
<p>The question raised by Hazony is which track is more likely to produce the desired result of devout believers. It&#8217;s a good question. It&#8217;s a different question that what is most comfortable, or what is easier, or what is more intellectually honest. He is simply asking which track has a better chance of survival.</p>
<p>I think he is correct that eventually it will be nearly impossible to ignore the outside world and the conflicts between it and the more maximalist positions. Granted, there will be contradictions to the minimalist positions as well, but it is easier to swallow a small pill than to swallow a beach ball.</p>
<p>Read Hazony&#8217;s article and join the conversation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>I was sent this link by PJC member Judd Magilnick.</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell is a great writer and has had a great influence on my thinking. Perhaps the greatest secular influence on me of all! I have not yet had a chance to read his new book &#8220;Outliers&#8221; however I have read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/opinion/16brooks.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=gladwell&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">this NY Times OP-ED piece.</a></p>
<p>I am not necessarily agreeing with the writer&#8217;s assessment of Gladwell&#8217;s position rather I am commenting on the writer&#8217;s position in relationship to &#8220;Perfection&#8221;.</p>
<p>The astute will notice that this is exactly the point we made in our &#8220;Perfections&#8221; discussion. Success in not predetermined, it is our hands and our task to be vigilantly improving ourselves. Of course there are elements that are outside of our control such as location of birth, IQ, default personality traits etc. but none of those can stand in the face of our will to succeed!</p>
<p>I guess Malcolm Gladwell (in the writer&#8217;s view) and Rabbi Akiva will have to just agree to disagree&#8230;</p>
