				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>♫ <em>&#8220;It&#8217;s the most awkward time of the year.&#8221;</em> ♫</p>
<p>For Orthodox Jews, and to a lesser extent, non-Orthodox Jews, the &#8220;Holiday Season&#8221; is certainly the most awkward time of the year. Everyone around us is in a super festive mood, lights and colors of the season are everywhere, and everything seems to somehow connect to the Holidays. Drinks at your coffee shop change, the decor in all the stores, all the music, movies or television programming morph into Holiday Season themes. I was at the Third Street Promenade this week and one Holiday tune was blasting in the first store I entered. A few minutes later, the same song started playing in the next store. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/15/tis-the-season-to-be-sparring/" target="_blank">Even Disneyland feels completely different</a>. It&#8217;s unavoidable.</p>
<p>This season makes me somewhat anxious, and I am sure it makes many other people feel uncomfortable.<span id="more-9041"></span></p>
<p>There are three general approaches to dealing with this discomfort.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9045" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/christmas-tree-dreidel-somethingmarissa1.jpg?w=980" alt="christmas-tree-dreidel-somethingmarissa1" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Some people embrace the dominant culture and assimilate further into American identity. Others use it as a justification for completely opting out of the dominant culture. They engage with the outside world sparingly, if at all, and avoid the discomfort completely. There&#8217;s also a group of people who do indeed engage with the outside world. They are aware of the Holiday Season. They imbibe in its non-religious flavors, but for the most part, they also are very careful not to allow the outside influences contaminate their religious celebrations this time of year. This group might enjoy a Holiday movie but would never dream of putting lights on the outside of their home in the Holiday spirit.</p>
<p>I think the second and third groups are made up of people with strong Jewish identities and mostly affiliated Jews who are fairly observant. These two groups treat the non-Jewish Holiday Season as somewhat prohibited or a guilty pleasure. Most agree that the outside influences of the Holiday Season don&#8217;t have a seat at the Jewish Holiday table. There are debates and discussions about presents, ridicule for Hanukah Bushes and Hanukah Harry, a complex about the way Chanukah seems a lot like Jewish Christmas, and a value system that discourages anything that &#8220;smells&#8221; non-Jewish.</p>
<p>I think there is a fourth way. <em>We should not be fighting the Holiday Season. We should be leveraging it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Here are the rules:</strong> If it&#8217;s prohibited by Jewish law, don&#8217;t do it. If it is not prohibited by Jewish law, and it enhances your Chanukah experience, you should do it. If it does not enhance your Chanukah experience, but might enhance it for others, or help you cope with Holiday Season angst, do it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s widely considered taboo for Jews to put up Chanukah lights on their homes because it&#8217;s &#8220;not Jewish.&#8221; But it&#8217;s not <em>not</em> Jewish and nothing we do on Chanukah is &#8220;Jewish&#8221; besides the rabbinic obligation to light candles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotum" target="_blank">Dreidel is not Jewish</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_pancake#Polish_tradition" target="_blank">Latkes are not Jewish</a>. Sufganiyot are mostly likely not Jewish (Muslims have celebrated Eid with donuts for centuries and sufganiyot are a variant of the Jewish donuts from Arab countries). Many people consider gifts not Jewish. Plenty of Chanukah stuff is not Jewish. It seems silly to say that we&#8217;ve adopted customs from the outside but now we can&#8217;t anymore. Be honest. Dreidel, latkes, sufganiyot and gifts came from the outside as a consequence of Jewish people assimilating a non-Jewish practice into Chanukah. It&#8217;s been happening for hundreds of years. Somewhere along the way, we decided nothing else from the outside would be kosher. I think this is a huge mistake.</p>
<p>The reason all those foreign rituals were adopted was not because a rabbi-gician performed a spiritual-oscopy and deemed these kosher customs. It happened because people liked the stuff they saw other people doing on their special days and they added those things to Jewish days. It&#8217;s not complicated. More importantly, it was a good decision! Nowadays we refuse to add things from the Zeitgeist to our Judaism, and I think this is hurting us. We should be leveraging the Holiday spirit and its flavors to improve our Jewish experience. There&#8217;s no good reason not to decorate your home for Chanukah. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to showcase <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/10/martha-stewart-judaism/" target="_blank">Martha Stewart Judaism</a>™. A Chanukah home should look at least as festive as a Christmas home. After all, we already call it the Festival of Lights.</p>
<p>I think this is actually one of the secrets of Jewish survival. Instead of assimilating into the outside culture, we&#8217;ve created a system of assimilating the outside culture into Judaism. We take their good ideas and Jewify them. That&#8217;s one way of crafting positive Jewish experiences. The Seder is one example of a non-Jewish experience, Symposium, that we made better and more Jewish. We&#8217;ve done this a million times and we stop doing it at our own peril. This is an integral part of our survival strategy. It would be unwise to jettison it. Every December we should leverage the festive mood, not fight it.</p>
<p>We should not have to choose between prohibition and guilty pleasures. We should embrace the festive season and make Chanukah awesome. Let&#8217;s be totally honest and say that Christmas looks like a lot of fun to the outsider so we thought it would be smart to incorporate some of the spirit into our Chanukah celebration. Same as we&#8217;ve done for generations. Honest. No guilt. Simply a better Chanukah experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the amazing Pacific Jewish Center Chanukah party yesterday, I spoke about using stories to keep our Judaism vibrant. After all, the Torah and Talmud are books of law but are replete with stories. Chanukah in particular is only told through stories as it is not mentioned in Tanach and the scant references in the Mishnah don&#8217;t inform us of the day&#8217;s obligations. Our knowledge of the day comes only thought stories. Even Maimonides, in his Mishneh Torah, which is devoid of storytelling for the most part, tells the story of Chanukah. So I urged everyone to tell Chanukah stories in their homes and add some warmth to the Mitzvahs of the day.<span id="more-7920"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/timthumb.php_.jpeg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7921" alt="timthumb.php" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/timthumb.php_.jpeg?resize=480%2C319" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>After the talk, Vladimir Skomarovsky told me his (true) Chanukah story.</p>
<p>From December 1941 to liberation in 1944, Vladimir and his mother were in hiding. They lived the catacombs of Odessa with other Jewish people who escaped the Holocaust by fleeing to the caves with their lives.</p>
<p>The catacombs of Odessa are an extensive network of underground caves.They are about 200 years old and the catacombs were home to many refugees escaping the Nazis.</p>
<p>On Chanukah they had no oil or candles, or could simply ill afford to consume valuable fuel to kindle the Chanukah lights. When it came time to light Chanukah candles, everyone in the cave would pick up rocks. In concert, they would scratch the shape of a candle into the cave wall. The first night they would carve candle number one, on the second night they would carve candle number two, and so it would be for eight days.</p>
<p>They could not light Chanukah candles with fire but the fire in their souls inspired them to keep the flame of Chanukah alive with their Chanukah menorah carvings deep in the catacombs of Odessa.</p>
<p>Vladimir celebrates Chanukah with candles of wax and oil today. But the spirit of his experience in the catacombs of Odessa lives on in his soul.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.559378" target="_blank">The purists insist</a> that Chanukah is a holiday that celebrates a victory against assimilation. They find this ironic because Chanukah is celebrated by so many assimilated Jews who don’t even realize that they are celebrating a holiday about winning a war against their spiritual ancestors. <a href="http://haaretz.com/jewish-world/rabbis-round-table/.premium-1.560152" target="_blank">In Haaretz I argued</a> that this is irrelevant and new meanings to holidays can be perfectly acceptable in Orthodox Judaism and it’s wrong to begrudge our fellows Jews an opportunity to participate in a holiday.</p>
<p>After a bit more thought, I am not so sure that the victory was in fact against assimilation and assimilators per se. The true purpose of the war was to liberate the Temple and re-establish autonomy so that the Jewish people could practice their God-given religion unfettered.<span id="more-7903"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1298383772_11-e1385626617988.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7904" alt="1298383772_11" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1298383772_11-e1385626617988-600x475.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The Syrian-Greek occupiers made laws that prevented Jewish people from following the word of God. Many people willingly gave up their Judaism and integrated into the foreign culture. These people completely assimilated our of fear.</p>
<p>The Maccabees and their followers were religious zealots who knew that if the Syrian-Greeks were not pushed out of the land, Judaism would have been lost. The lives of those who were living by the Torah were at risk. Whoever disobeyed the prohibitions against Judaism was to be killed. At one point, the Maccabees were threatened with death. It was then that Matisyahu was filled with the passion to wage a war for the sake of their religious beliefs. They took upon themselves the responsibility to evict the Syrian-Greeks from the Temple and to restore their religious freedom.</p>
<p>That is what the war was about. It’s true that when the Maccabees conquered areas within the Land of Israel they would return the citizens of each city and town to observance, however that does not mean that the actual war was for the purpose of un-assimilating the assimilated. It was a collateral benefit for sure, but it was not the objective. The objectives were autonomy, religious freedom, and the Temple.</p>
<p>The war was won when those three objectives were secured. The Book of Maccabees tells us very little about the Hellenized Jews living in the Land of Israel after the Maccabees had vanquished the Syrian-Greeks. Apparently, it was not an important fact to report. The battles were important. Winning the war was important.</p>
<p>So when we look at Chanukah through this lens, I am no longer convinced that the war was a civil war between Traditional and Hellenized Jews as it has been presented. It was a battle for the right to practice as Traditional Jews. The Hellenized Jews were apathetic to the goals of the Maccabee, and the Maccabees did what they could to restore the glory of Torah and Mitzvos to the Hellenists. But to make the entire story about defeating assimilation and assimilated Jews is not true to the story. Perhaps without a Meccabeean victory, total assimilation would have been inevitable, however there is no indication that anyone was pushing Traditional Jews to assimilate other than the Syrian-Greeks and other than through threat to life.</p>
<p>One can certainly argue that the meaning of the holiday should be informed by the staunch anti-assimilation stance the Maccabees took. It’s certainly possible. But is it the only interpretation of the story? Certainly not. Is it a tenet of our faith or a necessary component to the celebration of the holiday to hold that the war was not really a physical struggle, but a spiritual struggle and the real enemy was not the Syrian-Greeks, rather it was the Hellenists? Hardly. Is it still ironic if secular or marginally religious Jews celebrate Chanukah? I don’t think so.<br />
The holiday celebrates the restoration of the incredible opportunity to serve God as we were commanded. It was not merely a celebration of staving off assimilation. It was much more than that and focusing on assimilation detracts from the more prominent aspects of the story. And so, I think that if assimilated Jews are celebrating their sort of Chanukah despite their assimilation, they are more like the Maccabees than the Hellenized Jews. They are not allowing themselves to completely disappear. They are not identifying with the Syrian-Greeks who lost the war, nor the Hellenists who played at most a secondary role during the Chanukah story. Indeed, they identify with the Maccabees by celebrating a Jewish religious holiday while steeped in a very seductive American culture. There is nothing ironic or foolish about that. Nothing at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/rabbis-round-table/.premium-1.560152" target="_blank">This article was originally published on Haaretz.com</a>. It is reproduced with their permission here:</em></p>
<p><em></em>Hanukkah has become an iconic holiday. In many ways, it has become as well known and popular as Christmas. But what exactly is its message?</p>
<p>The origins of Hanukkah are mired in obscurity. The rabbis of the Talmud established the days of Hanukkah as a commemoration for a small jug of oil that burned for eight days instead of burning for one day, as expected. Religious zeal and fervor were the themes of the first Hanukkah. For much of Jewish history, and for much of Orthodox Judaism today, the holiday retains much of its Talmudic meaning. Hanukkah is like a wink from a hidden God reminding us that when we stand up for our Judaism, God is standing with us.<span id="more-7914"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/185367.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7915" alt="185367" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/185367.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This is not a very pluralistic message. It’s also not the way that most people look at Hanukkah today. Many people see that holiday as a celebration of religious freedom. Others see it as a beautiful way of competing with more popular holidays like Christmas. Yet others consider the military struggle for autonomy the central focus of the day.</p>
<p>Purists might <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.559378" target="_blank">recoil at the thought</a> that the Talmudic intent behind the holiday is being ignored or even changed.  I don’t think this is a valid concern.</p>
<p>Jewish holidays have multiple layers of meaning, often depending on time and place. During the First Temple period the holiday of Sukkot was a harvest holiday. Most Jewish people don’t celebrate the harvest aspect of the holiday anymore. Passover has meant different things to different people as well. It started as a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt. For many people throughout the long exile it has come to symbolize our yearning to return to the Land of Israel and a Messianic utopia.</p>
<p>Even within the somewhat narrow confines of Orthodox Judaism, Hasidut added new elements and meaning to our holidays. We have a longstanding tradition of reinterpreting Jewish holidays.</p>
<p>There may be no starker historical example of this reinterpretation than Hanukkah itself. Maccabees I and Maccabees II provide their own reasons for the holiday. No miracle of oil is found in these texts. Josephus also neglects to mention this miracle. These sources focus primarily on the military victory.</p>
<p>It is pretty clear that the rabbis of the Talmud sought to refocus the day from a military victory and its attendant zealotry in favor of the commemoration of a miracle of a small cruse of oil. The Talmud glosses over the military victory in its description of the holiday.</p>
<p><em>“What is Chanukkah? That [which] our Sages taught: On the 25th of Kislev &#8211; the days of Chanukkah, they are eight, not to eulogize on them and not to fast on them, for when the Greeks entered the Temple, they polluted all the oils in the Temple, and when the Hasmonean dynasty overcame and defeated them, they checked and they found but one cruse of oil that was set in place with the seal of the High Priest, but there was in only [enough] to light a single day. A miracle was done with it, and they lit from it for eight days. The following year [the Sages] fix those [days], making them holidays for praise and thanksgiving.”</em> (Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 21A, Translation from Sefaria.org)</p>
<p>In the Talmud, the military victory is presented merely as incidental to the miracle of the oil. There was no miraculous victory and winning the war was not worth celebrating on its own in their view. The rabbis of the Talmud may be said to have started the tradition of reinterpreting the Hanukkah story.</p>
<p>Medieval commentaries asked why Hanukkah is eight days if the miracle was only for seven days? There was enough oil for one day! One day was natural and seven days were miracles, so we should celebrate seven days of miracle. One commentary reinterprets the military victory as a miracle to answer this famous question. Another reinterpretation. This time in nearly direct opposition to the Talmud’s version.</p>
<p>Reinterpretation is all part of the Hanukkah story. As long as the message is consistent with the ideals of Judaism and serve to help maintain a connection to the essence of the holiday, we should embrace new ideas. Orthodox Jews may insist that the laws of rabbinic Judaism are incontrovertible, and in our view they are, but the message and meaning of our holidays have long been much more fluid. If today’s Hanukkah message can be transformed to a more unifying and inspirational day for more Jews, so be it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no more perfect secular holiday than Thanksgiving. It has a universal message, warm traditions, and is versatile enough to work to all kinds of people. I think it&#8217;s especially wonderful that so many Jewish people, including Orthodox Jews, have embraced Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>On a Jewish level there is nothing more basic than giving thanks. Gratitude begins the moment we arise with Modeh Ani. But that is a private declaration of appreciation to God. Thanksgiving gives us an opportunity to build greater gratitude with our friends and family. It&#8217;s a time to publicly give thanks to God and all the people in our lives who deserves appreciation. It&#8217;s true that we must be thankful everyday, but setting aside one day a year as a communal expression of appreciation is a wise tradition.<span id="more-7907"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7908" alt="The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961.jpg?resize=360%2C229" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Further, Jews need to be thankful simply for the existence of Thanksgiving. It is a uniquely American holiday and we have been blessed in America, flourishing and growing in unprecedented numbers. Thanksgiving celebrates America. We must celebrate America too. Indeed, we must be thankful for Thanksgiving itself.</p>
<p>Most of all, Thanksgiving gives us a splendid opportunity to share in an American tradition with our fellow Americans. So many other American traditions are antithetical to Torah and Judaism. We can&#8217;t in good conscience join in those celebrations. Christmas? Drinking and debauchery on New Years? Easter? as well as several other hallowed American traditions are not our traditions. But this one, Thanksgiving, that&#8217;s right in our wheelhouse. It gives us the chance to join together with the rest of America and in unison say thank you. That in itself is worth the effort to participate in the holiday. Although we don&#8217;t primarily associate as Americans, rather we are Jews first, it is a powerful declaration of unity to connect with 300 million Americans from diverse backgrounds, with a plurality of beliefs to celebrate Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>This year it&#8217;s even more fun as we can merge and meld some of our Chanukah traditions with Thanksgiving. The connections between the two holidays are self evident. Both were belated Sukkos style celebrations giving thanks to God. They are like siblings from the same parents.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s enjoy the holiday and be proud to live in a country that makes a holiday out of giving thanks, just like us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s understandable that Orthodox Judaism is reluctant to endorse academic approaches to Torah. The basic assumptions of Orthodox Judaism are in direct opposition to the basic assumptions of academic research. We believe God gave the Torah. We believe the Oral Law is the interpretation of the written Torah and it is equally binding. Academics assume none of that. The entire purpose of academic research is to approach the texts with zero assumptions and arrive where the pure analysis leads. Often these two approaches will lead to opposite results and this is not acceptable in Orthodox Judaism. We can&#8217;t be undermining our own religion.</p>
<p>I think there is an exception to this policy. The exception is Chanukah. No one thinks Chanukah is Divine. No one thinks that God commanded us to celebrate Chanukah. Everyone knows that the holiday was instituted by the Maccabees and was subsequently established by Megilas Taanis and then by the rabbis of the Babylonian Talmud as a holiday to be celebrated every year. So the worst thing that could happen if we follow the academic path is that we might find inconsistencies in the story or in the reasons for the rabbinic commandments of the holiday. But because we already assume it is not Divine, the potential harm from merging our traditional understanding with the academic view is minimal.<span id="more-7866"></span><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IRHT_126277-p.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7868" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/IRHT_126277-p.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="IRHT_126277-p" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>At most, we might discover that the version of the story according to the Talmud is not the only version of the story. What&#8217;s the harm in that? We are required to keep the holiday because of their power of Beis Din HaGadol, not because what they said is objectively factually true. If it turns out that they had one understanding of the story that is not corroborated by the historical evidence it wouldn&#8217;t make an ounce of a difference to us. We would still have to keep the holiday as commanded by the rabbis of the Talmud. If you disagree, stop reading.</p>
<p>With the preamble out of the way, I think it&#8217;s safe to dive right in.</p>
<p>The Chanukah story occurred between 167 BCE and 165 BCE. We have two apocryphal books describing the events of the Chanukah story. 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees were written within 50 years of the revolt. Megilas Taanis was written a century later, followed shortly thereafter by Josephus&#8217;s Antiquities. In all four of these texts we are told about the Chanukah story and the establishment of a yearly celebration.</p>
<p>In 1 Maccabees we are told that the celebration was for the restoration of the daily sacrifices in the Temple and the general rededication of the sanctuary. Hence the name Chanukah; a celebration of the dedication, as <span style="font-size: medium;">חנך</span> means to dedicate. 2 Maccabees echoes the same sentiments and adds that the first Chanukah celebration was a reflection of the Sukkos celebration of 8 days that they had been unable to celebrate a few months earlier because of the war.</p>
<p>Megilas Taanis simply proclaims the 25th of Kislev a holiday and it is forbidden to mourn for 8 days. The text does not give a reason for the celebration. Josephus slightly editorializes the version of 1 Maccabees in his work. But he adds the first reference we find to the idea of lights being associated with the Holiday:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days, [&#8230;] they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of the restoration of their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was, because this liberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The Babylonian Talmud famously asks &#8220;What is Chanukah?&#8221; The response is the quote from Megilas Taanis followed by an unsourced version of the Chanukah story that is familiar to Orthodox Jews.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;for when the Greeks entered the Temple, they polluted all the oils in the Temple, and when the Hasmonean dynasty overcame and defeated them, they checked and they found but one cruse of oil that was set in place with the seal of the High Priest, but there was in only [enough] to light a single day. A miracle was done with it, and they lit from it for eight days. The following year [the Sages] fix those [days], making them holidays for praise and thanksgiving.”</em> (Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 21A, Translation from Sefaria.org)</p>
<p>This may or may not have also been the version of the story according to the scholia (commentary) of Megilas Taanis. The original scholia was likely written between the writing of Megilas Taanis and the Talmud. A hybrid of two fairly early versions of the scholia seems to have the same story. It&#8217;s quoted by the Ohr Zarua (1260) in this manner. However, the foremost expert on the scholium is convinced (and for good reason) that the original commentary on Megilas Taanis does not contain the same version as the Talmud. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/08_HUCA73_Noam_v07.pdf" target="_blank">Vered Noam</a>) From what I have seen, it seems that this expert is correct.</p>
<p>So what we have is a very clear summary of the various explanations for the celebration of Chanukah. The most popular version is probably the Talmud&#8217;s explanation. Everyone &#8220;knows&#8221; that the small jug of oil was only supposed to last for one day and miraculously lasted for eight days. The popular English name for Chanukah is not &#8220;Dedication&#8221; rather it&#8217;s the Festival of Lights. Let&#8217;s assume the miracle occurred. It was not latched onto as a reason for celebration by the Maccabees. Nor was it a popular reason for the celebration at the time of Josephus. Although it&#8217;s safe to assume that candles were lit as part of the celebration of the holiday at the time of the Mishnah (and Josephus) as the Mishnah in Bava Kamma exempts someone from paying damages if a fire was started by outdoor Chanukah candles. Obviously, people lit candles and one was permitted to leave these lights outside the home on Chanukah. Further, as noted above, Josephus called the Chanukah the &#8220;Festival of Lights.&#8221; Still, there was no particular importance attached to this miracle until the rabbis of the Talmud.</p>
<p>I have a few thoughts on all this plus one thought that I choose to keep to myself for now.</p>
<p>First, 1 Maccabees follows the pattern of the Purim story. God is hidden throughout the story. There is no mention of God in the narrative. Heaven is used as a euphemism for God, but even then, God plays no active role. This is what we would expect from a story that took place after the Purim story. God&#8217;s name is omitted from Megilas Esther because God is hidden from them. Purim reinforces the concept of a hidden God pulling the strings from &#8220;afar&#8221; and arranging events to meet a specific end. It was always strange to me that Chanukah seems to revert to the pre-Purim sort of special event with an overt miracle. Further, what&#8217;s the point of this miracle? It was completely unnecessary and completely besides the point of the story. So it makes sense that a miracle would not be the focus of their narrative. The book was written like the Purim story with a focus on the man-made events with God&#8217;s tacit approval. Perhaps the sources up to the Talmud were following this pattern.</p>
<p>Second, there is a lot of speculation about why the laws of Chanukah were omitted from the Mishnah by R&#8217; Yehuda HaNasi. Whatever the reason, it was omitted. R&#8217; Yehuda HaNasi needed a <em>&#8220;heter&#8221;</em> to write down the Mishnah. His justification was that if it wouldn&#8217;t be written down, it would be forgotten. To me that means that whatever was not written down is subject to forgetfulness. Yes, there are those who try to say that the reason it was not written down was because it was so widely known, but I don&#8217;t think that fits. So it&#8217;s okay to assume that because it was not written down it might have been forgotten and the rabbis of the Talmud were using the lapse in memory to reinterpret the holiday for their own reasons. There are other examples of things being forgotten and reestablished in the Talmud. Of course, there is plenty of speculation on the reason the rabbis of the Talmud may have wanted to refocus the holiday on a God-made miracle as opposed to a Hasmonean military victory, and I have written some of my thoughts on that issue here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/12/the-chanukah-story-a-cautionary-tale-of-extremism-gone-wrong/" target="_blank">Chanukah 2012</a>. But most importantly, it seems that just about everyone who celebrates Chanukah, including non-Orthodox Jews, go with the Talmudic version of the story. That&#8217;s no small victory for the rabbis of the Talmud.</p>
<p>Third, the rabbis may have been tapping into something else in the rabbinic tradition. That is, the Talmud in Avodah Zara expanding on an idea found in Pirkei d&#8217;Rabbi Elazar states that Adam lit candles on the 25th of Kislev as it coincided with the Winter Solstice. Adam was banished from the Garden of Eden in the fall and watched as the nights grew longer and longer each coming day. He feared that that the pattern would continue until the sun would be completely hidden from earth. On the Winter Solstice he discovered that he was mistaken and the light would return so he lit candles. Lighting candles seems to be something so basic to this time of year that it makes sense that it would have become the focus of the Chanukah celebration. Even the biggest non-Jewish holiday of the year takes place this time of year and would seem to have nothing to do with lights. Yet, trees are lit up across the world. Lights are inescapable this time of year and it seems that the rabbis of the Talmud leveraged this for the benefit of Chanukah.</p>
<p>Regardless of the pre-Talmudic reasons given for the holiday, Orthodox Jews make the blessings on the candles because the rabbis of the Talmud had the authority to establish this holiday based on Megilas Taanis. Nothing that has been discussed here jeopardizes anything of significance. And so, we get to enjoy the academic study of the origins of Chanukah risk free.</p>
<p>When we light our candles this year we will be connecting ourselves to a chain of generations who lit candles, sometimes under extreme duress, to celebrate Chanukah. Let us hope that the fire of the Chanukah candles inspires us to light up the night of our exile and vanquish the negative forces in our personal temples of spirituality as they were vanquished from our public Temple 2200 years ago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6960" alt="iiTDIn4h" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/iiTDIn4h.jpg?resize=225%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" />There is an album of photos showing an amazing teapot on Reddit. Popchassid took the post from Reddit and turned it into a blog post. The teapot is pretty incredible. It has a bunch of compartments that hid several ritual items used in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The owner of the teapot says this about the teapot: &#8220;<em>I got this from grandfather before he died. First used by hidden Jews during the inquisition, it is shaped like a teapot, but contains many secret Judaica pieces. The Hidden Synagogue.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that there is no way this teapot dates back to the Inquisition.</p>
<p>The Inquisition was in 15th century Spain. One of the ritual items in the teapot is a dreidle. Many people are familiar with dreidle. They are a Jewish version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teetotum" target="_blank">teetotums</a>. Jews have played dreidle on Chanukah for at most a few hundred years. The word dreidle is Yiddish and it refers to the turning of the top.</p>
<p>Traditionally, teetotoums were played around Christmastime. That started in Eastern Europe a few centuries ago. We borrowed the game and made it work for Chanukah. No harm in that. But a tradition subsequently emerged that dreidle was played ever since the rabbis established the holiday of Chanukah. There is no evidence to support this claim.<span id="more-6959"></span></p>
<p>The Inquisition targeted Sephardic Jews. I am sure many Sephardic Jews used clever ways to disguise their practice of Judaism. It is possible that they may have used teapots to disguise their rituals. However, there is no tradition of dreidle among Sephardic Jews. There is no word for dreidle in a language other than Yiddish. Ergo, it is entirely improbable that a dreidle is in a teapot that dates back to the Inquisition.</p>
<p>My great-uncle has a boat that also has all the rituals hidden inside it. I don&#8217;t think that he claims that the boat was a disguise from persecution, I think it was just a cool way of incorporating Judaism into art. In other words, it&#8217;s possible that this teapot was not actually made or ever used to hide Jewish practices. It was an art form and it was for the sake of art.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an amazing piece of Jewish history, a true treasure. But let&#8217;s be careful to separate fact from fantasy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6615" alt="menorah-temple" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/menorah-temple.jpg?resize=224%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" />One of the anomalies of Chanukah is that we have historical and apocryphal texts along with rabbinic texts. We have a pretty reliable idea of what life was like when the Chanukah story took place. I think the context of the story sheds light on the far reaching consequences of the Chanukah story.</p>
<p>The Seleucid-Greeks were involved in a three way civil war. They thought conquering Israel would solve their problems by giving them a port in the Mediterranean. Meanwhile Greeks were integrating into the culture of the Land of Israel. This relationship started off amicably. The Septuagint was published. Greek / Jewish relations seemed okay. The two cultures shared some impressive characteristics. They both valued wisdom and scholarship as opposed to brute force. The Rabbis even considered Greek a sub-Hebrew language in the rank of languages. There was a legal system that was older and just as comperehensive as the Greek system.</p>
<p>On one hand the Greeks would be able to find much in common with Jewish people. On the other hand, there was no “need” for the Greeks to modernize the Jews. They weren’t a savage tribe that needs laws and philosophy to teach them how to live. Greek and Jews could live together so long as there was no attempt by one or the other to assert their will above the other. Many Jews adopted Greek culture into their lives. Some went too far and became Greeks or Hellenists. Other were religious, law abiding Jews who were acculturated.</p>
<p>At the same time that this is happening, a schism is forming within Judaism. The Pharisees were the traditionalists. They believed that the Oral Tradition was Divine and binding. They were heavily representative of rabbis and members of the priestly class. A non-rabbinic group was in its nascent stages and they called themselves the Sadducees. They rejected the Oral Law and rabbinic authority. The Sadducees saw a natural ally in the Greeks and the Hellenized Jews. They recruited the Greeks and Hellenized Jews to their cause. They were a good fit because the Hellenists were less traditional than the Pharisees and the Sadducees rejected tradition.<span id="more-6614"></span></p>
<p>Eventually the Hellenists and Sadducees enlist the Greeks to help their cause. The Seleucid King Antiochus is happy to oblige and he begins a reign of terror over the Jewish people. He forbade celebrating Jewish holidays, Torah study, and circumcision. The Pharisaic Jews resist these laws. The hand of the Greeks comes fast and heavy.</p>
<p>First there were passive rebels. They ignored the decrees and were mercilessly slaughtered. A war was not ideal because it would kill Hellenist Jews as well as Greek intruders. But in the end there was no choice. The Hasmoneans led a spirited rebellion and after 25 years of war eventually vanquished the Greeks. After just 3 years of fighting, Jerusalem is reconquered and the Hasmoneans rededicated the Temple and in a great symbolic and moral victory they lit the Menorah. The next year they instituted an eight day celebration that we are in the midst of celebrating right now.</p>
<p>This is the start of the Hasmonean dynasty. It lasts 103 years and ends tragically with zero Jews remaining from their line. Worse, another civil war that could be blamed on the Hasmoneans invites the Romans into Israel and eventually the Romans destroy the Temple and exile the Jewish people in one of the most horrific genocides in our history.</p>
<p>Hundreds of years later, the Talmud wants to distract us from the military victory because of the corruption it caused. The rabbis frowned upon the Hasmoneans. They focus on the miracle of the oil. The heretofore-unmentioned miracle of the oil. It is not mentioned in Maccabees or Josephus. The Braisa in Shabbos tells us about the miracle for the first time. Clearly, the rabbis of the Talmud were distracting the attention of the holiday from the victory of the war to the miracle of the oil.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>There can be many answers to this question. I propose the following possibility. Maybe the rabbis shifted the focus to the oil to remind us that the Hasmoneans were not exemplars of what the Torah really wants from us.</p>
<p>The Ramban says that the Hasmoneans were doomed because they usurped the Jewish monarchy and were also the Priests. They had all the power and the honor. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. But what was their fatal flaw? Why did they mess up so badly? Why didn&#8217;t they restore the Davidic monarchy? Why did they insist on keeping all the power?</p>
<p>I believe their flaw was a failure to properly adjust to modernity. They rejected everything Greek. They sought to completely remove the Greek influence from Israel. This exacerbated the rift between them and the Saducees and Hellenists. This caused those groups to enlist the Greeks. This caused a war. The Hasmonean led Pharisees were unyielding. They would not rest until their brethren completely rejected anything but their stringent beliefs. But the irony is that their fundamentalism worked for a little while. They did liberate the Temple. They did restore Jewish sovereignty to Israel.</p>
<p>But their ultimate downfall was because of a failure to address modernity. They had no approach to Greek culture. It was all or nothing. This was a recipe for short-lived success but eventual disaster. In the end the Hasmoneans were only able to reject or fully embrace the Greek culture. The Hasmoneans wound up as assimilated as one can possibly be. They had no approach to deal with modernity and they failed it.</p>
<p>The rabbis of the Talmud <em>did</em> have an approach to deal with modernity. They were Torah scholars but were well versed in the science and philosophy of their day. The rabbis were not &#8220;all or nothing&#8221;. The rabbis of the Talmud were willing to explore the wisdom that came from outside the Torah. The rabbis wanted us to realize the mistake of the Hasmoneans and focused on the oil, which was not really as important as the victory in the war. But the oil story has staying power. As we are taught, the Menorah in the Temple had 7 lamps and the three lamps on either side represented the wisdom of the world turning toward the center of Torah. That lesson is a lesson taught by the rabbis of the Talmud. The Hasmoneans could not relate to that idea.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, the oil teaches us another thing. Fire is the fusion of spiritual and physical. It is physical but it is used to symbolize the spiritual. We light candles for the souls of our loved ones. Fire is a nexus between the physical and spiritual worlds. The miracle of the oil part of the story makes Chanukah about the using of military might and newfound autonomy for service of God. We are being told that the Hasmonean way is not to revered or emulated. The fire and oil remind us to integrate the world with Torah. This was a message the rabbis could endorse.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Yaakov’s Shlomim</h2>
<p>Following the dramatic news of Yosef Hatzaddik’s survival in the flesh pots of Mitzrayim, Yaakov Avinu readies himself to visit his long lost son. With vigor and alacrity he packs his bags. Taking his entire family and all of his possessions in tow he head towards Be’er Sheva. Why Be’er Sheva? Chazal explain, it was years earlier that, “<em>vayeitzei Yaakov miBe’er Sheva</em>,” that Yaakov’s life travail from Lavan to Yosef commenced upon his departure from Beer Sheva. Now that his life had come full circle he went back to Be’er Sheva, to offer thanks to Hashem Yisborach in a <em>makom Tefilah</em> of his fathers, the place where it all began.</p>
<p>Energized with a renewed sense of <em>simchas hachyim,</em> Yaakov Avinu arrives in Be’er Sheva and immediately brings a <em>korban</em> of thanks to the <em>Ribbono Shel Olam</em>. However, unlike all <em>korbanos</em> offered heretofore, from the time of Noach and Avraham until this climactic moment, Yaakov does not bring a <em>korban Olah</em>, which is<em> kulo laHashem</em>. Rather, he offers <em>zevachim</em>, <em>shlomim</em> sacrifices. Offerings which are shared with and enjoyed by all. Interestingly, the Torah records that he offers them to the <em>Elokei</em> <em>Aviv</em> Yitzchok.</p>
<p><em>Mifarshei hamikrah</em> wonder; firstly, why <em>Shlomim</em>? Secondly, why not also mention <em>Elokei</em> Avraham as Yaakov had in the past? And finally, why wouldn’t one <em>korban</em> suffice, he obviously offered many animals (<em>zevachim</em>).<span id="more-4992"></span> One explanation provides us an extraordinary insight to golus in general and Yaakov Avinu’s persuit of <em>shlaimus</em> in particular. Perhaps it is a <em>remez</em> to the recipe for Geula as well.</p>
<p>The Ramban reminds us that Yitzchok Avinu represents <em>middas hadin</em>. He quotes the Midrash which teaches that Yaakov Avinu realized that with his impending descent to Mitzrayim the dreaded <em>golus</em> was about to begin. He feared for himself and his children. The total tragedy and devastation of the terror of golus could only be realized with the <em>middas hadin</em> (represented by Yitzchok Avinu) in full force. As such, Yaakov Avinu offered <em>shlomim</em> to the <em>Elokei Aviv Yitzchok</em>, to somehow sweeten the <em>middas hadin</em> through his offerings and thereby ensure Klal Yisrael’s ultimate survival through the darkness of golus that loomed ahead. Indeed, by being <em>matil shalom b’olam</em> with his <em>shlomim</em> offerings, the <em>middas harachamim</em> would be aroused. With H<em>akadosh Baurch Hu’s rachamim</em> ignited he could descend to Mitzrayim confident in Klal Yisrael’s future.</p>
<p>This was especially important to Yaakov Avinu who recognized that the descent of the <em>shivtei kah</em> to Mitzrayim started with the <em>kinah</em> of the brothers towards Yosef, an attitude that started with their perception of Yaakov’s playing favorite with his “<em>ben zekunim</em>.” Yaakov in his quest for <em>shlaimus</em> wanted a <em>tikkun</em> for this mistake. Thus the <em>tikkun</em> of his <em>shlomim</em> was personal and communal and he needed to offer at least two animals; one for himself and one for the <em>tzibbur</em>. Indeed, having come full circle, Yaakov wanted to be a <em>shaleim</em> thus <em>shalom</em> was priority number one.</p>
<p>This should not be lost upon us. The darkness of <em>golus</em> still engulfs us. We feel its pain in many ways. Yaakov Avinu taught us that he way to be <em>mamtik</em> the bitter days of exile is through multiple <em>shlomim</em>, creating a greater sense of harmony between each Yid and as a result between Klal Yisrael and <em>Avihem Shebashamayim</em>. The more we feel the <em>din</em> the more we need the <em>shlomim</em>. If one senses that klal Yisrael is feeling the pinch of <em>middas hadin</em> today, then Yaakov Avinu’s model should be our inspiration. We should be ambitious in being <em>marbeh shlomim</em> as <em>ohavei</em> and <em>rodfei shalom</em>! Perhaps this is one more reason why Parshas Vayigash is read immediately following the <em>chag</em> of Chanukah. With the<em> chag urim</em> just behind us we should not forget the Rambam’s concluding message of hilchos Chanukah where he states “<em>godol Hashalom shekol haTorah nitna la’asos shalom ba’olam”</em> It is Yaakov Avinu’s message to us as well. The only way to survive the dark days of golus is through being<em> marbeh shalom</em>. Let us do more. We can start today. In that zechus may we merit that the <em>oseh shalom bimromav</em> will be <em>yaaseh shalom aleinu</em> of <em>kol Yisrael bimhara biyameinu</em>, amen.</p>

The party featured delicious Chanukah foods and treats, dreidel contests, a moon bounce for the kids, entertainment for everyone courtesy of Derek the Mime a speech from the rabbi and most of all, lovely company.</p>
<p>As usual, the party was open to the Pacific Jewish Center community and to the public as part of our Outreach on the Beach programming. The community was well represented with an excellent showing at the party. With our doors wide open at on Venice Boardwalk we also met and made many old and new friends. People who had been in the shul before returned this afternoon. One woman had been in the shul in the 50&#8217;s and had not been back since. Others were old friends who were part of our community for many years before moving on. It was so nice to see them all. We also met many new people. Some were local Jewish residents who had just never had a chance to come to shul and others were travelers and tourists, some Jewish and some not at all.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful afternoon. We thank everyone who came and who contributed to the festive and celebratory atmosphere.</p>
<p>If you missed the party, you can listen to my speech here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/25/chanukah-2011-address-what-doomed-the-hasmoneans/" target="_blank">What Doomed the Hasmoneans?</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/shamash_drip.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4975" title="shamash_drip" alt="" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/shamash_drip-300x200.jpg?resize=300%2C200" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Separation of Church and State is widely regarded as a modern concept. For most of the world this is an accurate assessment. In some places in the world there remains no separation. What I mean by a separation between church and state is that quite simply there are two different and exclusive bodies that legislate religion and politics. Political leadership is vested in one person or group and religious considerations are seen to by a different person or group.</p>
<p>In the United States, I believe separation of church and state is a misnomer. It&#8217;s not that there is a separation as much as the state has no opinion on religion. I think that a truer version of a separation between church and state originated with ancient Judaism.</p>
<p>The law was that the political leadership of the Jewish people flowed through the Davidic family of the tribe of Judah. The religious leaders in ancient Israel were the priests and the Levites who were are members of the tribe of Levi. These two groups were separate. This separation of powers was to ensure that no group had absolute power. It created a balance between political and domestic interests and religious interests. It was a good system and I believe the model for today&#8217;s separation.<span id="more-4974"></span></p>
<p>The story of Chanukah tells the tale of the Hasmonean family rebelling against the oppressive Seleucid-Greeks. This family was a priestly family. They sough to restore honor and holiness to the Temple. They also sought political autonomy from the Seleucid-Greeks.</p>
<p>They won both.</p>
<p>At that moment that they won they should have appointed a Davidic heir to the throne. But they failed to do so. A Hasmonean was anointed king and this began a slow fall from grace for the Hasmoneans. Not one Hasmonean remained after several generations of intermarriage and intra-violence. The Rabbis of the Talmudic era cite their error in taking the throne as the reason for their ultimate colossal failure.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Hasmoneans did not separate church and state. They were the kings and the priests at the same time and carried absolute power. As time has proven time and time again, absolute power corrupts absolutely. The Hasmoneans ended up in the scrap heap of history because of their failure in this regard.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of candles on our Chanukah menorah. There are the candles that we light each light. On the first night we light one and the second night we light two and we continue adding candles for eight night. By lighting these candles we fulfill a religious obligation to light these candles as instituted by the great rabbis of the Mishnah. We light candles and create holiness.</p>
<p>However there is another candle. The shamash is the candle we use to light the nightly candles. It does not factor into the religious nightly lighting. It is a functional candle, not a holy candle. It is a candle whose name, shamash can mean &#8220;caretaker&#8221;. The shamash is the lighter. But it is not the candle of the mitzvah.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the requirement that we use a shamash was a wink from the rabbis of the Mishnah reminding us why the Hasmoneans were such a disaster. They did not separate the political from the religious. The functional and holy were too closely intertwined. The political leaders were from the same family as the religious leaders.</p>
<p>Chanukah remembers their initial success but the lighting of the Chanukah candles reminds us of their ultimate failure. They did not separate church and state. On our Chanukah menorah we do separate church and state. We light holy candles to do a mitzvah. We light those candles with a separate, purely functional candle.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not quite sure how to relate this idea to contemporary Chanukah celebrations and the current state of Jewish affairs. But I am pretty sure there is a message in there that reminds us that sometimes we and our leaders need to hear alternative voices. That a <em>kinas sofrim</em> among Jews is a good thing and helps us fine tune our personal observance. There cannot be just one way, with one leadership, with one set of ideas. There must be multiple voices. There can&#8217;t be absolute power because is absolutely corrupts. Just ask as the shamash.</p>

<p>As the ambassadors of Judaism on the Venice Beach boardwalk, we are charged with the resonsibility and opportunity to provide a Jewish experience to the myriad of Jews and non-Jews who pass our shul on a daily basis.</p>
<p>To that end, we provided an open house Chanukah party. Many passers-by came inside to partake in the spiritual and physical warmth of our shul and its members. Our community made a kiddush Hashem and I am proud of our Chanukah party.</p>
<p>Special kudos<span id="more-3430"></span> are in order for <strong>Jeff Liss</strong> who organized the entire shebang and to <strong>Rabbi Mintz</strong> for manning the doors of the Shul and inviting anyone who was interested into the shul. Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>Josh Blum</strong> snatched my camera as soon as I walked into the shul. The pictures that tell the story of our Chanukah party are his and we appreciate his talents (as well as being an integral member of the community) thanks Josh!</p>
<p>I also want to thank everyone who came to the party and participated in the festivities. Your presence was noted and appreciated.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that we are also lighting the Menorah on 3rd Street Promenade Tomorrow night. See you there!</p>

If you haven&#8217;t, where have you been? I admit it, this one should have been first.</p>
<p>This is a great addition to the Jewish Chanukah music genre. It loses a few points for not being an original tune, but the guys do a great job &#8220;making it their own&#8221; as Simon Cowell would say. And the lyrics seem a little forced at times.</p>
<p>But the production is pretty good overall and the popularity of the video speaks for itself. Oh, and I would have loved to see a cameo by Taio Cruz. Maybe in the remix&#8230;</p>
<p>They have now been featured on <a href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2010/12/03/hanukkah-video-helps-jews-sing-new-tune" target="_blank">CNN</a>, <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/music/festival_of_lights_burns_up_charts_SqloBtbM03L0i9humt3YtO" target="_blank">The NY Post</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/30/dynamite-hanukkah-remix-m_n_789765.html" target="_blank">The Huffington Post</a>, <a href="http://plj.com/Article.asp?id=2039446&amp;spid=" target="_blank">WPLJ.com</a> and every single one of my Jewish friends&#8217; Facebook page.</p>

<h2>Parshas Mikeitz</h2>
<h2>The Power of Prayer</h2>
<p>Parshas Mikeitz is chock full of vital yesodos for the ages. From the rags to riches saga of Yosef Hatzadik’s ascent to power as the viceroy of Egypt to the ten tribes search for their long lost brother, inspiring details of Hashgacha Pratis unfold before our eyes. So many deep lessons jump off the pages of our Chumashim that some of the subtle insights can get lost. One such message is found in the dialogue between Yaakov Avinu and Yehuda, as Yehuda implores Yaakov Avinu to entrust his youngest brother, Binyomin, to his care so that they can get food in Egypt.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yaakov Avinu was frightfully worried about what would befall Binyomin.<span id="more-3405"></span> He saw the prospects as alarmingly bleak. Indeed, Yosef was gone and Shimon, if alive, was languishing in a dungeon somewhere in Egypt. Bereft of nevuah, due to his profound sadness, Yaakov felt all alone. He wondered, what promise could the future hold? What could he do to assure that tragedy would not befall his beloved Binyomin? Though Yehuda was persuasive in trying to reassure his father that Binyomin would be safe with him, Yaakov Avinu was not convinced. But with the hunger taking its toll, despite his misgivings, Yaakov reluctantly agrees to allow Binyomin to travel with his brothers to Egypt under Yehuda’s watchful eye. And Yaakov Avinu conceives a plan. He instructs his sons to package the delicacies of Canaan, honey, nuts, spices and almonds, as a gift for the powerful viceroy. He insists that they return the money found in their sacks as soon as they arrive. Perhaps this will appease the ill tempered keeper of the Egyptian storehouse. What else could he do, to be reunited with Shimon and to assure the safe passage of Binyomin to and from Mitzrayim? From where else could he draw strength?</p>
<p>And then it hits him, as it impacts all who find themselves “mimaakim,” at very depths of frustration and despair, He cast his eyes to Shamayim and davens. Indeed, the the Torah tells us that Yaakov blessed his sons, v’Keil Shakkai yiten lachem rachamim – May Hashem Yisborach grant you mercy in the eyes of this feared man you are about to greet. And Yaakov continues, v’shilach lachem es achichem acher v’es Binyomin – may Hashem send you Shimon the other and Binyomin (so that you can return with them to me). It is interesting to note that Chazal teach us that Yaakov prophesized but did not know it. The word acher in the aforementioned posuk is referencing Yosef who is soon to be reunited with his father.</p>
<p>The text and context is profound. When Yosef was sent to seek his brothers, there was no mention of tefilla. Soon thereafter, he is sold. When the brothers embark on a journey to purchase food in Mitzrayim, again there is no mention of prayer, and Shimon is taken hostage. Without G-d in the picture, enriching and safeguarding each step along the way, anything can (and often does) happen. Now with the final blow seemingly so near and Yaakov Avinu at wits end, he davens and everything “just happens” to work out.n</p>
<p>This message should not be lost on us. Without prayer, all is lost. It is tefilla which energizes our dreams and animates our hopes for tomorrow. Davening brings Hashem Yisborach more closely into our lives and gives us the meaning we so yearn for. If we daven, we might even prophesize &#8211; although we don’t know it.  So strong is the power of prayer. But we need not wait till we are desperate to activate its power.</p>
<p>In many ways, it is prayer that is the very essence of our Chanuka celebrations. The Maccabim’s cry of mi laHashem aili was not only a battle call &#8211; it was a tefilla. The lighting of a menorah with enough oil for only one day was not merely an act of re-dedicating and consecrating the Bais Hamikdash, it was heartfelt prayer to our Master on High to renew His profound ahava with His people once again. This is why we emphasize in Al Hanissim thrice daily and in our bentching that the Chanuka holiday is “l’hodos ulihallel” &#8211;  to give thanks and praise – through prayer to the Ribbono Shel Olam. It is He who is the source of all goodness and it He who quests for our tefilos. We can take advantage of this moment so ripe for prayer to bring ourselves closer to the Ribbono Shel Olam and with His help, may we merit shiyamelu  mishalos libeinu l’tova! Chag Urim Sameach!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/md_horiz.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3397" title="myth billboard" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/md_horiz.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I am fascinated by the battle of the billboards near the Lincoln Tunnel.</p>
<p>The American Atheists, an atheist advocacy group paid $20,000 for a billboard that depicts a classic nativity scene with the text: &#8220;You know its a myth. This season, celebrate reason&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Catholic league has rebutted this sign with a sign of their own: &#8220;You Know It&#8217;s Real: This Season Celebrate Jesus&#8221;. Their billboard came in at $18,500.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the controversy over the bus signs that said: &#8220;There&#8217;s probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life&#8221;. (See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/09/seen-on-a-bus-ad-in-london-theres-probably-no-god-and-humanists/">Seen On A Bus Ad In London: &#8220;There’s Probably No God…&#8221; and Humanists</a>)</p>
<p>This particular controversy is a case where, in my opinion, pretty much everybody is wrong.<br />
<span id="more-3394"></span></p>
<p>First, the atheists say &#8220;You  KNOW it&#8217;s a myth.&#8221; How can one KNOW that something did not happen. It may not have happened and it may have happened. There is little evidence either way. So, it is disingenuous to claim that one can KNOW that it is a myth. And second, even if it IS a myth, that doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t true. And third, even if it isn&#8217;t true that doesn&#8217;t mean that the religion has little or no value.</p>
<p>I expect more from atheists. If your platform is reason, you should use it. Don&#8217;t appeal to sensationalist Madison Avenue emotions. If reason is on your side, use it! They claim they are trying to get people to think. Telling people what they know does not get them to think.</p>
<p>The Catholics are no less guilty of overstating their position. &#8220;You KNOW It&#8217;s Real&#8221;? Seriously? Isn&#8217;t much of Catholicism based on FAITH? If it&#8217;s faith, you can&#8217;t know it! Further, if Christmas was about celebrating Jesus, I bet the atheists wouldn&#8217;t mind so much. But Christmas has become a secular day as much, if not more than a religious day.</p>
<p>The symbolism of the holiday are certainly not biblical (perhaps to the exclusion of the nativity scene). Red coats, flying reindeer, trees, ornaments, mistletoe, even gift giving was at one point banned from Christmas. It is hard not to see that the holiday has taken on many non-religious connotations and is mostly celebrated with traditions that are recent additions.</p>
<p>So, are the atheists waging a battle against religion? Or maybe just traditions that have acquired religious meaning? A little bit of both. But I think they have been spurned by the latter more than the former.</p>
<p>And is it so bad to have added all these non-religious customs to a religious holiday? Yes and no. I think that Christmas has become overblown as a non-religious holiday. Its symbolism is entirely anachronistic for a middle eastern holiday. Yes, Christianity began as a middle eastern religion. There is some religion left, but I think for most people, it is <em>almost</em> like Thanksgiving. An agnostic family holiday.</p>
<p>I know that I am torn about these kinds of additions in Judaism. Ashkenazik Jews have many non-essential traditions that give each holiday a certain sense of nostalgia. I don&#8217;t cherish these traditions the same way I cherish the mitzvos of each holiday, but they do mean something. At the very least, they are like an homage to our grandparents. There is meaning there too. But I am careful to distinguish for myself and my family and my congregation that there is a qualitative difference between observing a mitzvah and keeping a tradition.</p>
<p>On Chanukah there are two mitzvahs. They are to light a candle and sing Hallel. Presents, latkes, dreidel, fried foods, dairy foods are all traditions. And they are pretty recent traditions at that. I think it is important to keep that in perspective so as to not allow the non-essential elements of the holidays usurp the true meaning of the holidays. But I also find at least some value and meaning in those traditions that connect us with our past and give us an appreciation for my family&#8217;s heritage.</p>

Back when Adam Sandler used to be funny. In those days of yore, Sandler used to sing songs that were mildy funny and usually entertaining.</p>
<p>One of those songs was the now famous Chanukah song. With its pop culture references, wacky rhymes and Sandler&#8217;s whiny voice, it has become the staple of Chanukah songs that non-Jews know.</p>
<p>So, here is Adam Sandler and the Chanukah song&#8230;</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>Happy Chanukah, Chanuka, Hanukah, Hanukkah.</p>
<p>No this is not an SEO trick. And no there is no official spelling either.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a song hint&#8230;</p>
<p>Everywhere you go, you hear holiday music. There is a dearth of decent Jewish Holiday music. This has become a sore spot for many Jews. They want to hear overplayed cliches and appeals to emotion for their holiday too. I can&#8217;t say I agree.</p>
<p>Yet, once in a while a great Jewish holiday song comes along and it deserves to be shared and heard.</p>
<p>Over the next few days I will be posting some Jewish holiday music that I like.</p>
<p>We begin tonight with my absolute favorite. How do you spell Chanukah? by The LeeVees.</p>
<p>I need to thank my friend Rabbi Quinn for introducing me to this song 6 years ago. Thank you!</p>
<p>Enjoy.<span id="more-3384"></span></p>

<p>As the Shul on the Beach, a community institution, we are charged with the responsibility and opportunity to bring Judaism to the boardwalk. Our Chanukah party, the first in a series of events and programs designed to reach that end was incredible.</p>
<p>Thank yous are in order to Jeff Liss for organizing, planning and executing the whole thing. Thank you so much. Many others contributed as well and for that we express our appreciation to you as well.</p>
<p>I have no way of knowing how many people came through our doors today,<span id="more-1866"></span>but it was a very large number. Rabbi Mintz was particularly effective at luring passers by into the shul. Thank you so much! The shul was packed with community members as well as many passers-by ranging from observant friends to completely unaffiliated Jews as well as many curious non-Jews.</p>
<p>I had the fortune of meeting some wonderful people. Like the father of an adorable daughter whose expectant wife was home. He thought a Chanukah Party would be the perfect way for this non-Jewish father to celebrate with his Jewish daughter. He noted, that as soon as possible, he will be bringing his wife and, God-willing, twin daughters, when mom and babies are up and about. He cited the generosity and friendliness of the community members as impressive.</p>
<p>I met people from all over Los Angeles. Locals, from Santa Monica and Venice. From all over Los Angeles from as far as the Valley to Marina del Rey. I met visitors from Chicago, New Jersey, Miami, Israel and the UK. It was truly a universal Chanukah celebration.</p>
<p>Once inside everyone was treated to warm hospitality, friendliness and traditional Chanukah foods. (Of course there was food.) Towards the end of the party I spoke to the remaining crowd and the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/13/pjc-chanukah-party-2009-address/" target="_blank">audio has been posted here</a>.</p>
<p>Our very talented Office Manager, Leslie Friedman took a lot of great photos. You can see them in a slideshow below. If you spot yourself leave us a comment and say hi!</p>

I hope to publish the sermon in its entirety in the coming days.</em></span></p>
<p>I would like to share with you an important message that strikes me as central to Chanukah and in particular to Chanukah in 2009.</p>
<p>In Friday&#8217;s NY Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/opinion/11brooks.html?em" target="_blank">David Brooks writes</a> about the Chanukah story. The article is interesting, a bit provocative and very thoughtful. I recommend reading the article in its entirety.</p>
<p>In his words:<span id="more-1840"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Mattathias’s five sons, led by Judah Maccabee, then led an insurgent revolt against the regime. The Jewish civil war raised questions: Who is a Jew? Who gets to define the right level of observance? It also created a spiritual crisis. This was not a battle between tribes. It was a battle between theologies… The lesson of Hanukkah is that even the struggles that saved a people are dappled with tragic irony, complexity and unattractive choices. And he is right and the struggle </em><em>continues today.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Maccabees fought their own Jewish brothers and sisters in an effort to regain control over a Jewish people that were spiraling into assimilation. As Brooks says, in their victory there remains a tragic irony.</p>
<p>Chanukah is a festival that reminds us of the fragmentation within Judaism. Whether it is the ancient epic struggle of Yosef and his brothers or the more current struggles between Jews from along the spectrum of politics, different hometowns in Europe, different Rabbis, different neighborhoods and even between more observant and less observant Jews, unity eludes us.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why the element of <em>pirsumei nisa</em>, of publicizing the grand events of Chanukah is so central to its mitzva. In no other mitzva is there so strong an element of publicizing that the observance of the mitzva depends upon it. How are we to publicize? Is it with bullhorns or billboards? TV ads or  2 page spreads in the NY Times?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It is by lighting candles. It is with fire. It is with light. The light unites us. The light does not play favorites. The light knows no sides. Fire is fire. The way we celebrate the festival of Chanukah is by publicizing a message of light. A universal light. A light that knows no friend or foe. Where there is light, there is light for all. We proclaim the Chanukah story with light. We proclaim a dedication to unity.</p>
<p>This Chanukah let us reunite.</p>
<p><em>We can do it </em>and we have the resources to do it. It is time to set aside differences and unite under the themes and ideals that we agree upon and not look to our differences for fuel towards animosity. Let us look for unity in one another.</p>
<p>If we can do that, it will be a modern day Chanukah miracle.</p>
<p><em>Part of my recent inspiration: (Matisyahu &#8211; One Day). Play the song and listen very carefully to the words.</em></p>
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/11520225?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Yes, this is the song <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/04/matisyahu-nbc-and-the-olympic-winter-games-make-a-great-team/" target="_blank">I mentioned as the soundtrack on the NBC promo for the Vancouver Olympics</a>.</p>

<p>A cute news item has been circulating the Jewish internets recently. I have seen links to the NY Times story on Twitter, Facebook, VIN and YWN.</p>
<p>I was tipped off by my friend who works at <a href="http://twitter.com/YUNews" target="_blank">YU media relations</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/10/from-wind-light-for-the-menorah/?scp=1&amp;sq=menorah&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">NY Times</a> picked up on a story about a student duo at Yeshiva University who made a very unique Chanukah menorah. Raffi Holczer and Mark Stauber are physics students and they spent 2 weeks making a different kind of menorah.<span id="more-1824"></span></p>
<p>This menorah is powered by a battery that is powered by a windmill. The whole set up is pretty cool. What caught my eye was their &#8220;drasha&#8221; on the Chanukah story.</p>
<p>As the story goes, the Maccabees wrestled the Temple from Greek rule and wished to light the lamps. Temple lamps can only be lit with ritually pure oil, none of which would be available for 8 days. A small jug of oil was found. It would only last for one day and the lamp would go dark after the one day. Miraculously, the oil lasted for the 8 days.</p>
<p>One of the duo, Mark Stauber, offers a very nice lesson to be taken from the aforementioned Chanukah story. In his own words:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“In the miracle of the menorah, they got back to the temple and there was only enough oil for one night, but they made it last eight days,” he said. “I see an analogy with the world’s fight for sustainable energy, to take that and make it last as long as we’re going to need it.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Managing and maintaining our natural resources is definitely something the Torah teaches us. From Jacob lingering to save a few small vessels (according to the Midrash) to the prohibition of destroying fruit trees. The Torah has been teaching &#8220;Green&#8221; for thousands of years.</p>
<p>I wrote about Torah and ecology on <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/22/earth-day/" target="_blank">Earth Day</a> and the next day in my <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/15/green-post/" target="_blank">Green Post</a>. It is a universal, non-denominational, non-partisan lesson about care and concern for the earth we inhabit.</p>
<p>I like the application of the principal to the Chanukah story.</p>
<p>These young men are also taking the idea of &#8220;Or L&#8217;amim&#8221; &#8211; light to the nations, to another level. They are using &#8220;light&#8221; to be that &#8220;light&#8221;.</p>
<p>Great job!</p>
<p>They also scored a gig on NBC News. Video is below.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></em></p>
<h1>Commitment and Pride</h1>
<p>The pursuit of success is a human attribute which enables individuals to shteig in ruchniyus and to achieve accomplishments in their inyanei d’alma as well. There is so much to strive for in every aspect of our lives. Yet, we often wonder, “how do we know if we are matzliach?” What is the formula for achieving true hatzlacha – success? Parshas Vayeishev offers a clue as it sheds light on the essence of our Chanukah experience.<span id="more-1833"></span></p>
<p>The posuk states Vayihi Hashem es Yosef vayihi ish matzliach – Hashem was with Yosef  and he was a man of success!. What was his secret. Rashi tells us succinctly, it was that Shem Shamayim shagur b’piv – Hashem name was free flowing from his mouth. Chazal explain this was not only Yosef’s response to poverty and servitude. He did not pray and turn to the Aibeshter only out of desperation, rather, even as he rose to a position of power and trust in Potiphar’s house, he was committed and proud of his Jewishness. Yosef never took Hashem Yisborach out of the picture, neither did Yehuda and his brothers. Yosef recognized, as the Tanchuma points out, haya Hashem imo kshahaya b’ravcha v’hayah imo btzaar. He kept Hashem at his side when times were good and when they weren’t. Yosef knew that if “G-d was his co-pilot” then he (Yosef) was in the wrong seat. It is Hashem Yisborach who is the pilot!</p>
<p>Chazal teach that the posuk &#8220;Boruch hagever asher yiftach baHashem&#8221; refers to Yosef. That was why he was an ish matzliach! With all of his hishtadlus, intelligence, good looks, leadership and administrative prowess Yosef puts Hashem Yisborach first. He knew, as the special Chanukah Haftorah reminds us, lo b’chayil vlo bkoach ki im bruchi amar Hashem!</p>
<p>But it is not enough to think emunah and bitachon. One must live with mi laHashem eilai as their mantra and model it 24/7. Though both Yosef’s hatzlacha and the victory of the Maccabim started with personal bitachon, it was, nonetheless, climaxed with living those values when it counted. Being closet Jews would not cut it. Not in the fleshpots of Mitzrayim or the caves of the Judean hills. Yosef did not keep his yiddishkeit in the closet. It followed him out of the Beis Medrash and into the work place! There was no double standard for honesty or integrity, sensitivity or decency. So spiritual and extraordinary was his character that the Torah declares vayar adonav ki Hashem ito, –  even an idolatrous Mitzri perceived his tzidkus and quickly recognized, appreciated and even rewarded Yosef for being the Tzadik that he was. Yes, Potiphar understood from Yosef’s actions v’chol asher hu oseh Hashem matzliach biyado.</p>
<p>The Maccabim, too, could not only keep their Yiddishkeit in hiding. They declared mi laHashem eilai! Their public devotion to mesorah is the original pisumei nisa – a proud, public display of their Yiddishkeit for all to see. They made sure that klal Yisrael would stand up and even fight for their beliefs. There would be no giving in to the decadence of contemporary society. They were tocho kibaro, ready and willing to be mosser nefesh for what was right not just because it looked good, but because it was Hashem demanded. With that pride, passion and fervor they were zoche to see one tiny flame burn for eight days. Each Yid, young and old can be inspired to live like Yossef Hatzaddik and the Maccabim still today. It just takes commitment and pride inside and out for all to see.</p>

I hang out on the Venice Boardwalk hoping to meet anyone interested in our shul or Judaism. I show interested passers-by the shul, sometimes we take a picture, (I tell them about the blog), I invite them to &#8216;something&#8217;, we shmooze and then they are on their way.</p>
<p>This Sunday was the last Sunday before our upcoming Chanukah party so it was a prime opportunity to publicize the party which is open to the public.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <span id="more-1800"></span>the weather was not cooperative. It was cold by Los Angeles standards and the boardwalk was much quieter than usual. Very few people stopped in to say hi on this day.</p>
<p>But one encounter was just so remarkable that I wished to share it with you.</p>
<p>A pair of women were walking and as they passed the shul one of them veered in our direction and asked if she could come inside. She said the magical words that we hear all too ofter &#8220;I pass by the shul all the time, but it was never open&#8221;. &#8220;We&#8217;re working on that&#8221;, I respond with a smile.</p>
<p>One of the women is Jewish, mostly reform, but has been affiliated with Orthodox as well.</p>
<p>After a few pleasantries, I reveal that I am the Rabbi. I introduce myself as Eliyahu Fink. She asks if I am related to any other Rabbi Finks. I reply in the affirmative. My father is <a href="http://finkorswim.com/category/rabbi-aaron-fink/" target="_blank">Rabbi Fink</a>. My <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/rabbi-berel-fink/" target="_blank">grandfather</a> was Rabbi Fink as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your father Rabbi Aaron Fink?&#8221;, she asks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes he is! Do you know him? And how?&#8221;</p>
<p>She tells me that she used to live in Buffalo NY where my father was Headmaster of the <a href="http://www.kadimah.org/index.php" target="_blank">Jewish Day School</a> for 4 years. She remembered me as a 6 year old boy and remembers my parents well. In fact she recently saw them at a wedding of a Buffalonian a couple years ago.</p>
<p>What a small world!</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will see her again at the Chanukah Party.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here is the picture I took with Linda in our Shul.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Jeff Liss did a tremendous job organizing and preparing the annual PJC Chanukah Party.

The kids and adults had a great time and we all thank Jeff for a job well done.

Tonight was a Connections night and I was on the program and I had to compete with the magician upstairs...

The question posed was as follows. The more significant miracle of Chanukah is the victory of the Maccabees over the Greeks in the physical and spiritual war in which they found themselves. There was another miracle of a small jug of oil lasting 8 days instead of 1 day. Why is the mitzvah of Chanukah to light candles connected to the miracle of the oil which is less important than the war? Why don&#039;t we commemorate the war with a mitzvah? Secondly, why was a miracle of oil necessary? God does not just show off His abilities to perform miracles, there must a reason why the oil needed to last until new pure oil was available... What was so important about the oil burning for 8 days?

By the end of the talk we had answered those questions and touched on some relevant topics. Including the special qualities of fire and how to win a moral war in a spiritual wasteland.

Enjoy!
