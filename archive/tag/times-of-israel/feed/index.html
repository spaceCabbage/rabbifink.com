Yom HaShoah has a slogan: Never Forget.
It&#8217;s an odd slogan for a Jewish Holiday. Us Jews, we never forget anything. We have very long memories.

<p>Yom HaShoah has a slogan: Never Forget.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an odd slogan for a Jewish Holiday. Us Jews, we never forget anything. We have very long memories. We don&#8217;t need to say &#8220;Never Forget&#8221; to remember Yom Kippur every year, nor do we need a slogan to remind us to light Chanukah candles or to host a Pesach Seder. We are very good at remembering both the good times and the bad. Indeed, &#8220;Never Forget&#8221; seems superfluous.</p>
<p>But I think I can explain it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never Forget&#8221; is not a slogan for those who are Jewish and won&#8217;t ever forget. The slogan is for everybody else. We are reminding the rest of the world that they cannot forget the Holocaust. We are not reminding them so that they should mourn with us. We can&#8217;t expect that kind of empathy from the rest of the world. We are reminding the world about the Holocaust so that it should never happen again &#8211; to anyone else.<span id="more-6888"></span></p>
<p>We have been through several Holocausts as a people. We can handle it. It&#8217;s painful and it&#8217;s dreadful, but you don&#8217;t stick around for 3500 years by folding after a Holocaust. We will never forget.</p>
<p>But the world is still a violent place. We have been doing better lately, but there is still genocide, there is still hate, there is still institutionalized oppression. The message of Never Forget is that the world can not forget what happens when hate goes unchecked. The world must remember that the good people of the world must stand in the way of the bad people of the world.</p>
<p>Never Forget means that we must do what it takes to eradicate fundamentalist hatred between groups. We must end oppression of weaker, smaller groups. We cannot let anyone be the victim of hate crimes. We are responsible to end all genocide. That is what it means to &#8220;Never Forget&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sharing the harrowing stories of the Holocaust, hearing heroic stories of survival, appreciating the compassion of those who saved us during the Holocaust are vital to the observance of Yom HaShoah. We all play a role in the dissemination of the message of Yom HaShoah. The short game is to experience Yom HaShoah and feel its emotion for ourselves and our families and our communities. The long game is to use our remembrances to further the broader universal goals to guarantee that the world &#8220;Never Forgets&#8221;, to find common ground with one another, and stand against hate.,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been more than 65 years. As a society, we can do a better job to end genocide and hate crimes. It is our responsibility to do a better job. Mass killings in Syria, Sudan, and Myanmar cry out for our attention. Hate crimes throughout the world remindÂ us that there is still much work to do. Today is a day to do something. Yom HaShoah should be noticed by the world, but not simply as a day to remember the pain of the Holocaust. The world should remember with us. &#8220;Never Forget&#8221; how a world can watch as millions of innocent people are slaughtered. If we can successfully impart this message, we can change our future. We can nudge the international community a little closer to a day where the entire world can live in peace and harmony. It takes work and it takes energy to tell our story to the world. But if we can do it the right way we will guarantee that no one else will ever need a day to say &#8220;Never Forget&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1828636222-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5735" title="1828636222-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/1828636222-1-300x173.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="173" /></a>One blogger at the New York Celebrate Israel Parade was so overwhelmed by the orthodox community&#8217;s involvement at the parade that she declared the future of Judaism in America to be orthodoxy. To be clear, the writer is not orthodox, but the lack of apparent vibrancy from the non-orthodox seemed to swing her vote for orthodoxy as the future of Judaism in America.</p>
<p>I happen to agree. It is extremely difficult to maintain cultural and social Judaism absent ritual and observance of Jewish law. It can be done, but it is becoming more difficult with each passing generation. The proof is in the pudding.</p>
<p>The brand of orthodoxy that will prevail in America is still up for discussion. The writer of that blog post was referring to modern orthodox Judaism seeing as they are the ones she saw at the parade.</p>
<p>Another person at the parade was overwhelmed to a certain degree by the participation of the non-orthodox. This person felt that orthodoxy was not as well represented as they could and should have been. In this person&#8217;s opinion, the parade showcased non-orthodox Jews showing their passion for Israel. The orthodox Jews were like an afterthought. This person is an orthodox Jew.<span id="more-5734"></span></p>
<p>How interesting is it that two different perspectives can yield such different observations?</p>
<p>I believe that we need a combination of the two to maximize the chances of success for American Judaism. And the perfect opportunity to implement this vision is at the parade. Israel is something we all (with the exception of some fringe anti-Israel groups) can agree upon. Israel activism and AIPAC are full of orthodox Jews. Not just modern orthodox Jews. More right wing Jews strongly identify with Israel as well. The JewsNews sites report heavily on Israeli society, politics, and events. Those are sites that are read and written by right leaning (not in the political sense) orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>It seems to me that a parade for Israel is the perfect time to march together in support of a cause and in solidarity with each other. The modern orthodox community has embraced this opportunity and marches in the parade every year. But aside from a few sporadic people from the more yeshivish side of the spectrum, the Agudah / chasidic / Lakewood communities are noticeably absent from the parade.</p>
<p>I understand that there are political concerns. I understand there may be halachic concerns as well. But I just wish we could see past those, if only for one day to stand together and do something as a united Jewish people. I just wish that for once, we could all join in unison and make a clear statement on behalf of something we all agree upon.</p>
<p>In the future of American Judaism, all Jews are able to work together on the things upon which we agree, and there are many such things. The places where we disagree will still be contested. But it will be more like two opinions from the same team as opposed to two opinions from opposing teams.</p>
<p>If we are to get there, I think the New York Celebrate Israel Parade <strong>2013</strong> is a great place to start.</p>
