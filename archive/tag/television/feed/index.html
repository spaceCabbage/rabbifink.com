<p>It&#8217;s been a few months in the making and many hours of discussions and hard work by several people, but mostly <b>Leslie Friedman</b>. We are very pleased to announce that Pacific Jewish Center | The Shul on the Beach will be featured on a full episode of a new series on a very well known cable network. We can&#8217;t disclose any more than that right now, but you&#8217;ve definitely heard of the network.</p>
<p>If you want to be on the show, you do not need to be a member of our shul, nor do you need to be an orthodox Jew. You can come for filming on Tuesday April 30 and Sunday May 5 to the Shul on the Beach. More specific details will be provided for those who want to attend. You will need to sign a release and you may or may not appear on camera. Tuesday will be a dramatization of a Shabbat service, please dress as you would for a Shabbat service. Sunday will be some sort of party at the shul, please dress appropriately.</p>
<p>Hopefully the show will air in the summer, but anything is possible.</p>
<p>If you want to come please let us know in advance so we can make sure we have the right number of people. You can email me at <a href="mailto:rabbifink@gmail.com" target="_blank">rabbifink@gmail.com</a>. Thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/angus_t_jones_blog.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6546" title="angus_t_jones_blog" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/angus_t_jones_blog-195x300.jpg" alt="" width="195" height="300" /></a>There is a very lowbrow television show called Two and Half Men. It used to star Charlie Sheen, but he went off the reservation. Ashton Kutsher took over for Sheen. But the other two stars have been there since the start. Believe it or not, despite capitalizing on bathroom humor, objectification of women, and recycling its own jokes, Two and Half Men is the #1 comedy on TV every year and it makes zillions of dollars. (What does that say about American culture?)</p>
<p>The stars of the show make upwards of $350,000 per 30 minute episode. Angus T. Jones is the actor who plays the youngest member of the household. He is a very, very wealthy young man.</p>
<p>Recently he has been doing some soul searching. Apparently making millions did not satisfy Mr. Jones, he needed some spirituality in his life. So he joined a black Mega Church in Atlanta that is Seventh Day Adventist (my favorite kind of Christians), where a man named The Forerunner preaches about the ills of today&#8217;s society. The Forerunner did a two part video of Angus T. Jones&#8217; Testimony. This is Mega-Church-Speak for one&#8217;s story of how they found Jesus.</p>
<p>If you want to hear Angus&#8217;s story click the YouTube link at the bottom of the post. Fascinating stuff.</p>
<p>But there is one quote in there that has become newsworthy.<span id="more-6545"></span> Angus says:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;If you watch &#8216;Two and a Half Men&#8217;, please stop watching &#8216;Two and a Half Men,&#8217; I&#8217;m on &#8216;Two and a Half Men&#8217; and I don&#8217;t want to be on it. If I am doing any harm, I don&#8217;t want to be here. I don&#8217;t want to be contributing to the enemy&#8217;s plan&#8230; You cannot be a true God-fearing person and be on a television show like that. I&#8217;m not okay with what I&#8217;m learning, what the Bible says and being on that television show.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Now this set off a bit of a firestorm. Angus has since apologized and all seems okay at this point.</p>
<p>The question I have is whether Angus should be working on a show that he feels goes against his morals. If he feels that it is such a disgraceful show, how can he not be a hypocrite if he still acts on the show?</p>
<p>Perhaps the fact that he is under contract makes fulfilling the terms of his obligation the morally correct thing to do. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>
<p>It just seems so disingenuous to talk about not wanting to be on the show and then being on the show. No one is forcing him. He should have the strength to act upon his convictions. If it&#8217;s really so bad (and apparently it is) he should put his money where his mouth is, and quit.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it&#8217;s just a lot talk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x5951.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5392" title="article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x595" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x5951-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>It was last Pesach that the NY Times slipped an <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/31/thoughts-on-kiryas-joel-the-poorest-city-in-america/" target="_blank">article about Kiryas Joel</a> under the blogosphere&#8217;s radar. This year, the Post slipped an article almost under that same radar about a reality show featuring ex-hasids. But just because many of the blogs hibernate during Pesach, doesn&#8217;t mean that we can&#8217;t talk about the show now.</p>
<p>Details are scant, but it seems that several of our more well-known ex-hasids will be starring in a reality show. We met Pearlperry Reich and Shauli Gros on the Dr. Phil show (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/03/05/rabbi-shmuley-is-more-embarrassing-than-pearlperry-reich-on-the-dr-phil-show-and-analysis/">Pearlperry Reich on the Dr. Phil Show</a>). Since then, we have become friends on Facebook. Now they are joining forces with Luzer Twersky to tell the world about how they left their homes and their previous lives.</p>
<p>The story is familiar enough. An insular, old-fashioned world meets the fast-paced, liberal world. The results are bound to be emotional, funny, and dramatic. The show has not yet been picked up, so there&#8217;s a chance it never airs. If it does air, the stars hope it will improve the lives of the members of the communities they left. By giving a strong voice to the ex-hasid, the show might expose some of the less savory aspects of insular life. If the claims are false, the show will be a terrible pock on the Jewish community. If the claims are true, then either we should take pride in those claims or if they are negative, try to fix them.</p>
<p>But in the end, this show is a terrible idea.<span id="more-5390"></span> I can only assume that the stars of this show have never seen reality TV shows. These shows are train wreck television. The entire point of these shows is to portray uncomfortable situations and manufacture drama. No one comes out of a reality show smelling like roses. No one. Ever.</p>
<p>Put it this way &#8211; words that have never been stated after watching a reality show: &#8220;Wow, those people seem like such lovely human beings. I hope they have much success in their lives and hopefully I can be as well-adjusted as them one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, as much as I am interested in the story that these people have to tell and as much as I empathize with many of their struggles, I can only see how this show will only harm them and their new ex-hasid community. There are other, better ways of pushing their agendas forward. If you have a message and an idea, the worst way that I can think of to spread that idea is on a reality show. How about a documentary? Or a well-written informative website? Or a speaking tour? Or writing a book? Reality TV is lazy. It is lazy for its producers. It is lazy for its viewers. But most of all, in this case, it is lazy for its stars.</p>
<p>If you have a true message and a great story, don&#8217;t sully it on reality TV. Please.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/super-bowl-2011-try-2.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3725" title="superbowl 2011" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/super-bowl-2011-try-2-207x300.png" alt="" width="207" height="300" /></a>This Sunday, the most celebrated American tradition returns with its yearly dose of football. It&#8217;s the Super Bowl (TM). I know, I&#8217;m supposed to call it the &#8220;Big Game&#8221; or something nebulous like that, but I won&#8217;t.</p>
<p>For football fans, the Super Bowl is usually one of the most disappointing weeks of football. That&#8217;s because a team, OTHER THAN YOURS, wins the darn thing. But for non-football fans, the game is a yearly infusion of football and bits of entertainment spliced into 30 second spots called commercials.</p>
<p>This year, Fox is selling Super Bowl ads for about $2 million dollars a pop. It is the most watched television event every year and the cost of the commercial time creates a huge buzz surrounding the ads. Corporations dedicate millions of dollars to producing their Super Bowl ads and the ads live on far beyond the Super Bowl via YouTube and blogs inviting viewers to cast their votes as to their favorites.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Super Bowl is a huge opportunity for a company to generate buzz and market its products. Last year I wrote about the Pro-Life ad that was unnecessarily controversial (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/01/28/tim-tebows-pro-life-superbowl-ad-is-heartwarming-and-reckless/">Tim Tebow&#8217;s Pro-Life Super Bowl Ad is Heartwarming and Reckless</a> and then <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/02/07/retraction-tim-tebow-ad-was-harmless-not-reckless/">RETRACTION: Tim Tebow Ad WAS Harmless NOT Reckless</a>).<span id="more-3724"></span></p>
<p>Sometimes the ads that don&#8217;t get aired are even more interesting than the ads that do get aired.</p>
<p>This year several ads have been banned from airing during the Super Bowl. These bans are not from the FCC. They are self-censoring bans by Fox.</p>
<p>One ad is by Ashley Madison. This is a company that helps folks in committed relationships have an affair. Their slogan is &#8220;Life is short. Have an affair.&#8221; Their CEO is upset that his company&#8217;s ad was rejected it by Fox. He called it censorship. Well yes, it is censorship. The question is if it is warranted.</p>
<p>Another censored ad was an ad that could be viewed as residing on the completely opposite spectrum of morality. This ad was advising people to look to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_3:16" target="_blank">John 3:16</a> for inspiration. Fox rejected this ad because it contained &#8220;Religious Doctrine&#8221;. This is also censorship. The question is if it is warranted.</p>
<p>I think that both commercials are appropriate for Television. However, they are not appropriate for the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl is a family television program. It is watched by the same people who watch Saturday morning cartoons and PBS Kids. Ads that assume that the maturity and sophistication of the audience is over 15 years old are plainly inappropriate.</p>
<p>Ashley Madison can advertise on shows and programs that adults are the primary viewers. Children are not the audience that Ashley Madison wants to target and worse, children don&#8217;t have the maturity to deal with ads that may cause them to contemplate issues that are not appropriate for their demographic, like infidelity. An ad that tells viewers to look up John 3:16, which by the way, says that with Jesus you will be alright, the inference being that without Jesus you won&#8217;t, is not appropriate for children who think they are alright without Jesus because that is how their parents raised them. The Super Bowl is a family event and the ads should reflect that reality.</p>
<p>Personally, I find ads for Viagra and Cialis or other adult only products and services during sporting events offensive. These two ads are even worse. My suggestion for parents watching sporting events with their kids is simply not to watch commercials. First of all, you will spare them the sick consumerism of the West for a little while longer. But more importantly, the advertisers are not considering the effects of their ads of kids and sometimes the ads are just not appropriate for them. Do them and yourself a favor. Skip the ads.</p>
<p>How? Get a DVR. Or turn off the TV for the commercials. Or just have the kids engage in another activity aside from watching the commercials.</p>
<p>I think Fox is in the right for censoring some Super Bowl commercials. I wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing even more censorship for family programs like the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>And as a Ravens fan: Go Packers!</p>
