				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7137" alt="DoubleLife-Cover" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DoubleLife-Cover-231x300.jpg" width="231" height="300" /></a>I received a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife: One Family, Two Faiths and a Journey of Hope</a> a few weeks ago. It took a while for me to actually  sit down and read the book but I read it over the weekend and will do my usual review with a side of analysis on the book.</p>
<p>The story is quite intriguing. A Jewish man who makes a living playing music at Church and a Christian woman who does the same fall in love, get married, and end up as orthodox Jews. There&#8217;s a lot of blanks to fill in and the book does a fair job of telling their story.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to notice the book&#8217;s most obvious shtick right away. The entire story is told in letters between Harold and Gayle. Harold&#8217;s letters are written in regular typeset and Gayle&#8217;s are in italics. I found this very distracting. I don&#8217;t like italics. But that might be a personal quirk.</p>
<p>The larger issue is that it seems so artificial. Everything is written in letter format. Even things that couples obviously already know about one another. Normal people do not write letters to each other that ask the big questions like &#8220;will we have a Christmas tree or Hanukkah bush in our home&#8221;. Normal couples do not express themselves in letters to the exclusion of anything else. Yet, the book expects us to believe that all these important conversations took place via letters. Either these are real letters, which is just odd or it&#8217;s a gimmick. Making things worse, in order for this to work logistically, the two of them are almost never together. He is writing about his life, she is writing about her life, but because of the format we rarely get a feel for what life is like for the two of them when they are together. Some people might like this format choice, but I did not. It was weird.</p>
<p><span id="more-7134"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> tells the reader a lot about how difficult life can be for intermarried couples. They really don&#8217;t fit in anywhere. The Christian community does not embrace Howard and Gayle and we all know how skeptical the Jewish community can be of intermarried couples. I was surprised that the more liberal branches of Judaism were so antagonistic toward Howard and Gayle. It could just be that this was their experience and others have had different experiences. But reading the book, one would think that Reform and Conservative rabbis and communities are not welcoming to intermarried couples. This might be true in general, but all one can say from the book is that this was the experience of this couple. I would not say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> dishonestly portrays the positions of other denominations to puff up orthodox Judaism, but it at some points it did feel like that a little bit.</p>
<p>The punchline of the book is that the one place that welcomed Howard and Gayle more than any other was the orthodox Jewish community. In the end, despite their reservations, especially Gayle&#8217;s, the couple settled in the orthodox Jewish community. Gayle had a full orthodox conversion and the couple is has been living as orthodox Jews ever since. I do admit to completely breaking down during the conversion scene in the book. It was very emotional and I felt that the book did an excellent job making the moment work as a true climax of the story.</p>
<p>I wish the book would have spent some more time dealing with the theology of becoming an orthodox Jew. Gayle struggles with it quite a bit and we are never really told what changed her mind from resistance to acceptance of orthodox Judaism. I suspect it was mostly an emotional decision but I thought we should have heard a bit more about the transition.</p>
<p>The book tells a great story, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> also seeks to carve out a place for intermarried couples in orthodox Judaism. On the one hand their story seems to say that they are welcome with open arms, but on the other hand it seems that more resources are needed to handle these situations in the orthodox community. To that end <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> promotes the website created by Howard and Gayle for intermarried couples <a href="http://j-journey.org">j-journey.org</a>. The site seems to focus on orthodox conversion exclusively.</p>
<p>This all leads me to the piercing unasked question raised by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. What should be the Jewish approach to intermarriage. In a generation where more Jews intermarry than &#8220;intramarry,&#8221; what is the best way to handle it?</p>
<p>As it stands now, we discourage intermarriage so vociferously that orthodox rabbis will not officiate the ceremony of an intermarried couple. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> seems to indicate that Reform and Conservative rabbis will not officiate either. What chance do we have of ingratiating an intermarried couple back into Judaism if we can&#8217;t participate in their wedding? I am not saying that we should ignore halacha, God forbid. I am only saying that we stack the deck against the intermarried couple that it becomes extremely difficult to include them in our communities. It is something that we need to work on and I think the Bermans are doing good work by trying to make orthodox Judaism more inclusive for intermarried couples.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. It&#8217;s worthwhile to read the book just to sense of the difficulties that intermarried couples encounter in their spiritual journeys. But more importantly, the book raises questions we must answer about how we handle intermarriage in the modern world. If you have read the book, I welcome your thoughts as well.</p>
