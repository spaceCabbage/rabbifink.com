				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/03/11/does-jeff-mcgregor-learn-messilas-yesharim/" target="_blank">A few months back I hinted at a future post</a> about athletes and their role in our society as role models.</p>
<p>This past weekend I was reminded about my feelings on the subject. What I feel is what I believe to be the Torah approach but is of consequence and significance to anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>Over the weekend the NBA Conference Finals were settled. Something that happened after one team was eliminated has caused a media frenzy.<span id="more-735"></span></p>
<p>First, the Los Angeles Lakers advanced to the NBA finals for the 30th time in 61 years. (yay!) That is serious excellence right there. For the non-fans this means that during the games you will be able to drive the speed limit on the 405 because everyone else will be inside watching the game.</p>
<p>Then on Saturday night the impossible happened. LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers were eliminated by the Orlando Magic. Why is this the impossible? LeBron is a &#8220;godlike&#8221; figure and was expected to &#8220;redeem&#8221; his team and city by bringing them to the &#8220;promised land&#8221;. I am not kidding. Sportscenter on ESPN had a segment where a Minister from Cleveland said that Clevelanders were beginning to worship &#8220;The King&#8221;. LeBron is the most celebrated human being on the planet and is idolized around the world.</p>
<p>Anyway, the poor guy loses in 6 games to the Magic.</p>
<p>Ironically, this gives ABC Broadcasting which is owned by Disney a Walt Disney World (Orlando) vs. Disneyland (LA) Championship. Talk about jackpot!</p>
<p>The custom in all sports is for the losing team to shake the hands of the winning team and congratulate them upon winning. In fact according to Websters, this is the very definition of &#8220;Sportsmanship&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span>conduct (as fairness, respect for one&#8217;s opponent, and graciousness in winning or losing) becoming to one participating in a sport.</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The word has been around since <em>1745</em> and is preached universally to all athletes and competitors.</p>
<p>LeBron was so upset about losing to the Magic that <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/news/story?id=4218722" target="_blank">he left the court in a hurry</a> and did not congratulate the winning team. This is a big no-no.</p>
<p>In fact, he was so upset<em> </em>by the loss he also skipped out on the mandatory press conference.</p>
<p>That is bad sportsmanship. No question about it.</p>
<p>Do I care?</p>
<p><em>Absolutely not.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect better from an athlete. His excellence in Basketball has no bearing on his excellence in social skills, personal growth, intelligence, happiness or even sportsmanship. The only thing that he does that commands respect is his ball playing prowess. That is the only thing I look up to in this person.</p>
<p>Is he sending a bad message?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t turn to LeBron for messages on Sportsmanship. Nor do I turn to any athlete or celebrity for anything other than waht makes them unique or special.</p>
<p>As a parent it is my job to provide good role models for my children. I may need to be that role model at times. At other times it will teachers, Rabbis, family members or other people who command respect for their area of specialty. Athletes are not role models. Allowing an athlete to be the role model for your child is a failure inÂ  your parenting.</p>
<p>Athletes may by chance turn out to be wonderful people whom we may respect for their abilities beyond sports, and that is great but it is not the norm. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/01/kobe-and-zehirus/" target="_blank">I myself have commented</a> on some athletes ability to prepare for their games and we can learn about preparation from them. However, expecting athletes to be role models is a terrible idea.</p>
<p>I think parents get lazy and expect their children to learn good values without taking the time or effort to teach those values. When the child gets nothing from his parents, athletes may fill that void. Ultimately they will all disappoint us.</p>
<p>Be a role model and don&#8217;t rely on superhuman athletes to do it for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-US/default.aspx" target="_blank">Lego</a>. My brother and I spent countless hours in our childhood building magnificent Lego creations. My son Rami has recently added Lego building to his skill set &#8211; he is quite good!</p>
<p>If I had to choose one toy to play with I would certainly choose Lego. It is the perfect toy.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe me? You need to check this out&#8230;<span id="more-319"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://niemann.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/i-lego-ny/" target="_blank">This New York Times Opinion piece</a> will show you what Lego is all about. This guy did a great job.</p>
<p>In addition although we love LA and don&#8217;t want to live in New York, there is a nostalgia that always will be associated with NYC. Just ask Kobe Bryant. He says his favorite (<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ROAz5SkUMu8" target="_blank">and most succesful in recent memory</a>) place to play is New York. New York is a special place but there is no way I would trade <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/adegerma/49%20Santa%20Monica%20Beach.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> for <a href="http://z.about.com/d/manhattan/1/0/i/1/centralparksnowybench1.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. (It&#8217;s been 80 degrees for a couple weeks now). As<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/13/california-dreaming-no-longer/" target="_blank"> I mentioned previously</a> it&#8217;s not just about the weather but it sure is nice&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://myespn.go.com/blogs/truehoop/0-37-122/Kobe-Bryant---Video-Fiend-.html">Kobe Bryant&#8217;s Work Ethic</a></p>
<p>It is undisputed that Kobe Bryant possesses superior basketball talent to every human being on the planet. That is not enough to be the best basketball player on the planet. There is a discipline aspect that Kobe excells in beyond his inborn talents. Kobe is the first in the gym and the last guy to leave. He puts in more hours in the weight room than anyone else. <a href="http://myespn.go.com/blogs/truehoop/0-37-122/Kobe-Bryant---Video-Fiend-.html">This</a> article illustrates a third way Kobe excels off the court. Kobe studies film. Kobe studies more film than anyone. This reminds me of Ray Lewis as well. Ray Lewis has all the talent necessary to be the best middle linebacker in the world. Where he gains an even greater edge is film study. Kobe says he learns tendencies and habits of his opponents by studying every move of theirs.</p>
<p>What are these athletes doing studying so much film? They have the talent to succeed on their natural abilities, yet they put so much extra work into their game. Why?</p>
<p>The answer is <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2008/12/28/messilas-yesharim-1228-2/">what we just studied in Messilas Yesharim</a>. In order to succeed in our moral challenges we need to prepare. We need to see our adversary&#8217;s (our animalistic urge) tendencies and get to know him. We need to plan ways to avoid challenges and strategize ways of defeating our adversary before the challenge comes to us. It is not enough to be skillful in our moral battles. We need to be prepared as well. This is the secret of the most successful athletes like Kobe and Ray Lewis and it is the secret the Ramchal teaches us in his chapters on Zehirus. The first step to winning the moral war within ourselves is to prepare. It sounds so simple but most of us don;t even think about how we can make those preparations. We continue the explanation of Zehirus this coming Sunday&#8230;</p>
