				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7081" alt="91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_-230x300.jpg" width="230" height="300" /></a>Over the weekend it was reported that a teacher in an orthodox Jewish school in Seattle has been charged with molesting two six year old girls in his class. It is suspected that this fellow molested more than just the two girls but he is only charged with molesting the two girls.</p>
<p>Sex abuse happens everywhere. It is no indictment of a school, community, or family if sex abuse occurs. The test is how sex abuse is dealt with. The most important question is whether the victim is able to articulate that they have been abused and that the victim has a safe place to talk about the abuse. If no one comes forward there is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>It takes great courage to come forward. But more importantly, it takes education to come forward. Our best defense against abuse is quite simply our children. If they are equipped with the tools necessary to prevent molestation and report it when it happens we have our first two lines of defense in place.</p>
<p>The prosecutor in the case in Seattle attributes the girls&#8217; willingness to come forward and their ability to articulate what happened to a book that is the brainchild of Rabbi Yakov Horowitz, written by Bracha Goetz and illustrated by Tova Leff. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a>. Incredibly, it took years for this book to see the light of day. But now it is endorsed by leading Torah authorities and it must be in every home and every school.</p>
<p><span id="more-7080"></span></p>
<p>In a sensitive way, the book gives children the tools to prevent abuse. When the book was released, I bought several copies of the book for my home and anywhere else I thought it necessary.</p>
<p>Just consider for a moment how incredible it is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> helped end a cycle of abuse in Seattle. It could do the same in your community. Get the book.</p>
<p>In places where abuse is not reported and not even acknowledged there is too much space for predators to wreak havoc. It is a matter of <em>sakanas nefashos, </em>we must act now. Our children must be educated. There are no excuses. We must educate our most insular communities on the harms of abuse and help them help themselves get out from under the cycle of abuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> is so versatile that it is not only a book that prevents abuse. The book also keeps children safe generally. Rabbi Horowitz shared with me a letter that he received from a learning disabled child thanking him for the book as it helped him in several situations. The letter is so sweet and innocent, it brought tears to my eyes. It is time for us to take this challenge and grab it by the horns. The first step is buying and using this book.</p>
<p>Aside from the book, Rabbi Horowitz has an excellent video on keeping our children safe. Watch that here: <a href="http://youtu.be/LWQHaInsCGk" target="_blank">YouTube</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6623" alt="newspaper_press" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/newspaper_press-288x300.jpg" width="288" height="300" />Now that the Weberman trial is behind us we can reflect on the reactions from within and outside the community. Specifically we need to to analyze the role of the media, secular and religious.</p>
<p>The New York media reported the Weberman case. I found their reporting to be pretty fair. They did not prejudge, they did not take sides, and they mostly followed typical conventions for cases like this one. CNN (national media) also reported on the guilty verdict. They went a bit more big picture including a Deborah Feldman sound bite about the Va&#8217;ad Hatznius. It was a very fair and informative segment.</p>
<p>The Jews News sites (YWN / VIN / Matzav) are an interesting case study too. As far as Matzav and YWN are concerned there was no Weberman trial. The man doesn&#8217;t exist. The victim doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s literally like an ostrich digging its head into the sand.</p>
<p>VIN reported extensively on the trial. The comments are predictably erratic. But the site did a good job keeping their readers informed.</p>
<p>I find it disgraceful that two of the three largest Jews News site ignored the trial for reasons that will become apparent shortly.</p>
<p><span id="more-6622"></span></p>
<p>The bloggers all talked about the trial. A few defended Weberman, most did not.</p>
<p>There are some people who take issue with the way the media handled this case and the way Satmar was covered. On Zev Brenner&#8217;s Talkline, Yossi Gestetner was on the line for about an hour complaining about the media coverage. Others on Twitter and Facebook have attacked Oren Yaniv of the Daily News and Rabbi Horowitz for not balancing their talk about Satmar&#8217;s role in this crime with effusive praise for the chessed in Satmar.</p>
<p>Rabbi Horowitz responded on Twitter with some very important points which I think must be shared.</p>
<ul>
<li>He compares this complaint to A-Rod complaining that when the media talks about his poor post-season effort this year they neglect to mention his charity work.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an apt comparison. The news is not about judgment or portraying a group or individual. It is about the news. And the news is that A-Rod stunk in the playoffs. The news is not that he has a charity. Nor does his charity work mitigate his failure to perform under pressure. It&#8217;s not only completely irrelevant, it detracts from the real story.</p>
<ul>
<li>The press has an important role in keeping society in check. This is why freedom of the press is vital in any free and just society.</li>
</ul>
<p>The news outlets must be able to report on abuses of power and miscarriages of justice. They serve as a deterrent and more importantly, they empower the public to withstand tyranny. If the message is completely controlled by the powerful entities in any society there is no chance for freedom. The press have the right and ability to keep the public informed and tell leadership that the public does not approve of bad behavior.</p>
<p>A good society needs a good press to report on the injustices and pain within their society. It cannot be treason to say something negative about one&#8217;s society. It is the only way to effect change.</p>
<p>Ignoring &#8220;bad news&#8221; in the frum media is a complicit form of tyranny. It tells leaders that we don&#8217;t care about corruption or destructive behavior. This enables them to continue their reign of terror on the public.</p>
<ul>
<li>The next point is that there is a strong level of violence or threat of violence to those reporters and to Rabbi Horowitz.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the ultimate indicator of a rotten core. Shooting the messenger or even just ignoring the messenger is a terrible tactic for fixing real problems. The chessed of Satmar is irrelevant to keeping our children safe. It is irrelevant to the news. But threats of violence and actual violence toward those trying to change things is part of the story. It tells the world that we care more about our reputation than our children. Rabbi Horowitz has had to protect his Twitter account and make it private (you can request to follow him, but otherwise he is hidden) because of all the attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, the lack of change in the community is inexcusable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are they not clamoring for education on sex abuse? Why are they not desperate to protect their children? And why is the leadership not giving them this education? What purpose can it serve to keep their community ignorant of the signs of abuse and the horrors of its effects? Why has there never been a &#8220;Children&#8217;s Safety&#8221; event in Satmar? At the very least, why are they not giving their community the tools to be honest with their children about this case?</p>
<p><strong>To that end, Rabbi Horowitz is hosting a teleconference this evening. Click here: <a href="http://www.rabbihorowitz.com/PYes/ArticleDetails.cfm?Book_ID=1658&amp;ThisGroup_ID=238&amp;Type=Article&amp;SID=2">Project YES Teleconference</a></strong>. Get the word out and get on the phone. Anyone who wants to listen in can call in. Mother, fathers, teachers, rebbeim, moros, whomever. Just call in. Get educated. Spread the message. We will not tolerate this violence in our communities. We all play a role. Rabbis, activists, parents, the press, and everyone else. Demand that the frum press cover these stories and when the secular media reports on our flaws let&#8217;s fix them, not wonder why they are not reporting on chessed. When we clean our house it will sparkle and the shine of our chessed and kindness will be obvious to everyone.</p>
