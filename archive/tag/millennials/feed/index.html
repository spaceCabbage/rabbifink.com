				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pew Research Center released their recent study, and the results paint a bleak picture of our religious future in America. It is clear: God’s poll numbers are down across the board, and especially among Millennials. Immediately, frantic media headlines prophesied the end of religion as we know it.</p>
<p>Is this fate? Are we destined to live in a non-religious world? I don’t think we are doomed, unless we keep doing the same things we are doing now. If we want to reverse the trend, we need to reverse course. Suggesting change in religious circles is often taboo. It reminds me of one of my father’s oft repeated (aren’t they all?) jokes. <em>How many Ultra-Orthodox rabbis does it take to change a lightbulb?</em> [beat] <em>Change?!</em><br />
<span id="more-9356"></span></p>
<p>We believers think God gave us our religions. They are not ours to be tinkered and toyed with on a whim.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/07/13/religion-is-dead-long-live-religion/sf/" rel="attachment wp-att-9357"><img class="alignright wp-image-9357 size-thumbnail" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sf.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="sf" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> Thus, many believers exclaim that people are abandoning religion because we have become too flexible, too apologetic, too concerned with popular opinion and trends. Their solution is fundamentalism, as it was for the Puritans after the Renaissance, premillennial dispensationalists after Darwin, and Evangelicals in the 80’s after the sexual revolution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, post-modern fundamentalists are making a fundamental mistake. Most Millennials will never be fundamentalists. Above all, they reject the idea that there is only one universal truth. Where hippies rejected authority on principle, Millennials reject appeals to authority because there is no such thing as an authority of ideas. For my entire lifetime of active learning, I’ve been able to fact check anything asserted by an authority as fact. I have never needed to trust authority or rely on the opinions of one person. Self-guided research, diversity, and subjectivity are native to the Millennial generation.</p>
<p>When presented with fundamentalist ideas, we don’t find the “all or nothing” packages attractive. Some of the ideas that are preached by fundamentalists have merit, but that does not translate into adopting fundamentalism. It did in the 80’s. Evangelical Christianity and the Jewish “returnee” movement were massive movements that took hold in the 80’s, and both remain in their own shadows from that time. More fundamentalism is not the answer. In fact, it&#8217;s part of the problem.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the non-fundamentalist option has been to change. When the rules get tough, change the rules. If some of the theology is at odds with modern ideals, just rewrite it. By drawing a target around the arrow after it is lodged in the tree, liberal religious groups can make participation effortless and guiltless. The appeal of change is that is promises everything, but the reality is that this sort of change completely undermines religion.</p>
<p>Millennials flock to authentic experiences. Burning Man is a perfect example of this.  A Burning Man experience is powerful, unique, and above all, authentic.  Similarly, artisanal foods are quintessentially Millennial. No Millennial is trading fine French cuisine for a Big Mac. We want the real thing. We want meaningful experiences.</p>
<p>A counterfeit religious experience is no religious experience at all. It might keep families together at church and synagogue for a few more years, but without authenticity and engagement, nothing will connect Millennials to the experience. It’s hollow. When the structural shell is removed, nothing remains.</p>
<p>But all is not lost. I think there is an alternative approach that respects tradition, does not compromise authenticity, and works for Millennials. The first part of my proposal is that religion is actually a collection of beliefs and practices which ask us to struggle in the tension they create. There is beauty in tension. Ambiguity and doubt are key ingredients to great art. Poetry, music, theater, visual arts, culinary arts, love, and beauty are all ambiguous. They are all open to interpretation, and they all ask us to insert our struggles into the space they create for creative understanding.</p>
<p>We must stop preaching certainty and begin preaching doubt and struggle. Find beauty in the tension, instead of satisfaction in certainty. Religious leaders must be honest, and publicly acknowledge their own struggles and doubts. Instead of occupying the space of certainty that is anathema to Millennials, religion must occupy the space of subjectivity, ambiguity, and struggle. Religion is not the answer to life’s questions. Religion is the tool for exploring the big questions.</p>
<p>We can tolerate mistakes, difficult challenges, unanswered questions, and tension between tradition and modernity. We will not tolerate platitudes, over-confidence, false bravado, and apologetics. Be honest. Acknowledge the problems. Admit your own struggles. Then, invite the Millennials in your life to join you for an authentic experience of engaging with life’s struggles through the lens of religion. The Biblical heroes were flawed and they struggled. Let’s emphasize those stories and animate those Bible passages in our teachings.</p>
<p>The second part of my proposal is found in the tension between nostalgia and relevance. So much of our religious instruction and experience is nostalgic. We try to recapture something magical from our childhood, or a latent memory from a place and time that tugs at us. Millennials love nostalgia, and it’s a valuable tool when, but religion cannot subsist on nostalgia alone.</p>
<p>Our world is so different from the world of our Biblical heroes. Our lives are virtually nothing like the lives of the centuries of interpreters and teachers of religion. We must continue to lean on the eternal teaching they have bequeathed to us, but their teachings felt contemporary to their direct audiences. When we retell their teachings, they may feel nostalgic at best and irrelevant at worst. We must continue to write and create teachings that resonate with us and tell our story.</p>
<p>The Bible is an incredible canvas. Religious texts offer innumerable opportunities for modern interpretation. Not the kind that strips religion of its precepts, rather, the sort of modern interpretations that bring ancient teachings to life. When we explain our rituals, we must choose explanations that add meaning to our lives today. Take ownership of our religions. We can&#8217;t expect Millennials to be spectators of their religion. Millennials want to participate with mind, spirit, soul, and body. Relevance is key to hooking religion to our lives, and not merely relegating our traditions to museums and mausoleums.</p>
<p>I believe in God. I believe in religion. I believe in Millennials. This is fixable problem. Let’s fix it. Acknowledge our struggles. Live in the tension. Make religion relevant with new and modern interpretation. Live a life infused with religious meaning. When the results of the next Pew report on religion in America are released, we can shock the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve met a lot of Young Jewish Professionals in Los Angeles. A few months ago I attended a four session, 25 hour seminar that grappled with the issues facing the broader Jewish community and Jewish millennials. There are many issues.</p>
<p>One of the issues is Jewish engagement. Without parents dragging them to Jewish events and without children compelling them to participate, many Jewish millennials experience a severe dip in their Jewish involvement after high school that continues until parenthood. As the the gap between Jewish experiences increases, the odds of future engagement decrease as well.</p>
<p>A major obstacle to Jewish engagement is money. Events and programs cost money. Millennials are famously struggling financially. With only one income and the high cost of living in major cities across the USA, Judaism becomes a luxury that too many millennials simply cannot afford. As a nation, we cannot afford to lose them.<span id="more-8688"></span></p>
<p>A very high percentage of Jews would like to attend High Holiday services. With good reason too. The religious experience, coupled with the social experience and nostalgia make a good case for participation. But in cities like Los Angeles, High Holidays seats are very expensive. There are free or almost free services available. But most of these are kiruv oriented services. The service is provided for free, but there is an implication that the leaders of the service are trying to win people to their version of Judaism. That&#8217;s okay, but not everyone is comfortable in a kiruv environment. Many people want to attend a service that feels familiar and is attended by other people from similar backgrounds who practice a similar version of Judaism.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/08/10/help-send-jewish-millennials-high-holiday-services/img_8921/" rel="attachment wp-att-8692"><img class="alignright  wp-image-8692" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_8921.jpg?resize=389%2C291" alt="IMG_8921" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>My professional mission is to provide positive Jewish experiences to the maximum number of people possible. I want to help these Young Jewish Professionals. They are from my generation. These are my people. We grew up in the same world. I&#8217;m a millennial rabbi.</p>
<p>My idea is to send Young Jewish Professionals who cannot afford High Holidays tickets to the High Holidays service <em>they want to attend</em>. <strong>The money raised by this campaign will be used to buy High Holidays seats for Jewish Millennials at the synagogue or temple of their choosing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So for my Young Jewish Professionals, here is what I say:</strong> I want everyone to be comfortable this High Holiday seasons. Go where you feel comfortable and I will pay for your seats. If you have no preference, you are invited to The Shul on the Beach where we have a diverse group of people and we do everything we can to make everyone comfortable. Share this campaign so people in your social circle who can help fund this campaign will help us out. If you would like to be a beneficiary of this campaign, please email me a <a href="mailto:rabbifink@gmail.com" target="_blank">rabbifink@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>For everyone else, here is my pitch:</strong> Please buy one extra seat this High Holiday season. But don&#8217;t give the money directly to your synagogue. Make a donation to this campaign and I will make sure it goes to good use. If your seats cost $100, please donate $100. If your seats cost $500, please consider donating $500. You&#8217;ll be helping create positive Jewish experiences for people who need them badly.</p>
<p>As a bonus, your donation will earn you a prize. The more you give, the more you get. Plus, giving charity is the best way to prepare for the High Holiday season.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an American, I am embarrassed by the entire Mozilla affair. To recap, the now ex-CEO of Mozilla, Brendan Eich, donated $1000 to a &#8220;Vote Yes on Prop 8&#8221; campaign. That means that on 2008 he was in favor of a law that would ban gay marriage. He was appointed CEO of Mozilla a couple of weeks ago. OK Cupid, a dating site, posted a pop-up notice on their website when a Mozilla Firefox (that&#8217;s the web browser developed by Mozilla and favored browser of Internet enthusiasts from 2010), that asked users to consider not using Firefox to protest the appointment of a Eich. Other Internet activists stoked the flames and eventually Eich voluntarily resigned.</p>
<p>This turn of events outraged a lot of people. The outrage crossed social and political lines. Conservatives, liberals, libertarians, gay activists, and individuals from pretty much every possible group joined in the disgust over what has transpired over the last few days. This has spawned many thoughtful articles and blog posts arguing that Eich did the right thing and the people who forced his hand were in the right.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s embarrassing for a lot of reasons. The obvious reasons for shame are the proliferation of terrible arguments, blatant hypocrisy, and lack of self-awareness being demonstrated.<span id="more-8307"></span></p>
<p>For example: The misuse of the right to free speech, the hypocrisy of only seeing how one side of this is free speech, the two-faced claim that it was wrong of OK Cupid to &#8220;censor&#8221; Firefox but then to boycott Mozilla because Eich stepped down, the misstatements of facts about Eich&#8217;s resignation, the invoking of the free market as a solution to problems and then crying when the free market doesn&#8217;t go their way, the crying about being bullied and then bullying others, the claims of tolerance and then not tolerating this, our reverence for the secret ballot and then publicizing campaign donations,  and the list goes on and on.<a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/0626c2d83673d8a8413b44a77aac7a7a.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8309" alt="0626c2d83673d8a8413b44a77aac7a7a" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/0626c2d83673d8a8413b44a77aac7a7a.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But as embarrassing as the saga has become, it is also quite intriguing to take a step back and analyze some of the tension between several competing policies at play. The right to free speech, the free market, free will, tolerance, tolerating intolerance, the measures of what constitutes intolerance, political issues vs. moral issues vs. personal beliefs, and perhaps most of all, the generation gap.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/04/mozillas-gay-marriage-litmus-test-violates-liberal-values/360156/" target="_blank">As Conor Friedersdorf correctly points out in The Atlantic</a>, the majority of the state of California supported Prop 8 in 2008. The majority of the United States opposed gay marriage until circa 2012. Gay marriage has reached a bit of a tipping point. Most prognosticators presume that support for gay marriage will be overwhelming within the next few years. But it was not that long ago that gay marriage had very little support. In effect, Eich is being punished for taking a position that the majority of Americans held when he made his donation. More on this later.</p>
<p><a href="http://features.pewforum.org/same-sex-marriage-attitudes/slide2.php" target="_blank">The demographics of support for gay marriage bear this out</a>. Around 75% of Americans 18-29 support gay marriage. Among Baby Boomers, the number drops to 48% and in 2013 it was just 41%. Brendan Eich is 52. He was born at the tail end of the Baby Boomer generation. This is all very important. This means that to older Americans like Eich, gay marriage is a legitimate issue that hovers in the 60/40 and 50/50 range. It&#8217;s something that is debated and for every Boomer who opposes gay marriage, there is one Boomer who favors gay marriage. But by no means is it a settled issue for them. However, for young people, the numbers indicate that this is a very one sided issue. Those who oppose gay marriage are a significant minority. That means that it&#8217;s not really an issue that has two evenly balanced sides anymore in the minds of Millennials. As young people enter the work force and find a public voice, the public conversation will shift to reflect the views of a new generation. There are going to be growing pains. The tension of any seismic shift can cause an earthquake. On the Richter scale of social earthquakes, this was a 12.5.</p>
<p>I think this played a huge role in the Mozilla saga. Younger people have a hard time seeing gay marriage as a debatable issue. To Millennials, it&#8217;s almost like being in favor of racism. It&#8217;s simply not an issue up for discussion. So when young people, who I belive are disproportionately influential in Silicon Valley and the Internet Activist community are exposed to something that does not meet their threshold for legitimate debate, the result is outrage without nuance and without sensibility. I think this explains some of the blind rage and demand for blood.</p>
<p>There is a Orthodox Jewish angle here and it&#8217;s not the obvious one. If you think about it, Eich made his $1000 pledge when there was minimal social objection to supporting Prop 8. He is of a generation that is slowly adapting and changing its collective mind on gay marriage. But it is completely inappropriate to judge his donation or even his opposition to gay marriage from the perspective of a 27 year old. Eich didn&#8217;t grow up in the same world as that 27 year old. The 27 year old didn&#8217;t grow up in the same world as Eich. We share a planet and some common experiences and values, but in essence the world is a completely different place. <em>(I&#8217;ll be writing about some of these differences one of these days.)</em> It is not only unfair, but I think it might be immoral, to judge a 52 year old man with glasses of a person who lives in a different world. As the sages teach us in Ethics of Our Fathers, &#8220;Do not judge your fellow until you have stood in his place.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a 1:1 comparison, but there are some parallels in Orthodox Judaism. There are ideas, and freedoms, and rights that exist today that never existed at any time in history. The world is flatter than it has ever been. Diversity is not only accepted, it is revered and cherished. International discussions and debates are completely normal. Our grasp of history and science is unparalleled. It will certainly continue to improve, but as it stands now, an American school child should know more about the hard sciences and history than the greatest scholars of yesteryear. They were extremely handicapped by their lack of knowledge. We don&#8217;t blame them. We don&#8217;t insult them. We don&#8217;t look down on them. But if we are honest, we are forced to concede that the geniuses of ancient times or medieval times were on the ground floor. We are standing on their shoulders.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to judge our Torah giants with modern glasses. Even if we think our modern glasses are true and good and moral and Torah consistent, we cannot possibly expect anyone who was not given the blessing of information bestowed upon us to reconcile with our ideals. Yet, the Torah is somewhat malleable. It has adjusted in the past, especially with the imprimatur of the generation&#8217;s leaders and general public opinion. So let&#8217;s appreciate what we have for what it is. Let&#8217;s not be upset when it doesn&#8217;t meet our modern expectations. So much of great wisdom is eternal. It may need a little tweaking and fine tuning, but we are confident that our Torah, which has withstood the test of time, will endure.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no small thing. Whether it&#8217;s a secular debate, discussion about morality, or political issue, social conditions and environment play a gigantic role. Keeping this in mind can help dial back some of the outrage and open the door for improved communication and cooperation. But in order to talk, we need to understand each other. In order to appreciate the greats from our past, we need to understand them too.</p>
