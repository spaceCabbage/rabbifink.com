<p><em>Jewish and Christian communities have long struggled to make religion relevant to youth and teens. One of the ways that both communities have attempted to combat the problem of disaffected youth has been to offer alternate programming for young people.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/7-23-12-Munich-moment-of-silence_full_600.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5873 alignleft" title="7-23-12-Munich-moment-of-silence_full_600" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/7-23-12-Munich-moment-of-silence_full_600-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>A while back I wrote about the IOC&#8217;s decision not to have a moment of silence for the Israeli terror victims in Munich at the &#8217;72 games. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/18/there-will-not-be-a-moment-of-silence-for-the-victims-of-terrorism-at-the-munich-olympic-games/">There Will Not Be a Moment of Silence For the Victims of Terrorism at the Munich Olympic Games</a>) I disagreed with the decision, but I also challenged those who wished to have a moment of silence to garner support for their cause and pressure the IOC, not simply demand a moment of silence.</p>
<p>That is exactly what they did.</p>
<p>People like President Obama and other world leaders past and present supported the idea of a moment of silence at the Opening Ceremonies. This has been seen as a slap in the face to Israel and Jews worldwide. Add this insult to the BBC&#8217;s incredibly narrow idea of not calling Jerusalem the capital of Israel, it&#8217;s easy to feel like everyone is out to get us.<span id="more-5872"></span></p>
<p>I just want to point out that the IOC is commemorating the Munich Massacre with a moment of silence and the IOC chairman will be attending a memorial in September in Munich, and they already had a brief moment of silence at  moment of silence in the Olympic Village (see photo above for proof).</p>
<p>These things have either already happened or will happen. The <em>only</em> thing we won&#8217;t be getting is a moment of silence at the actual Opening Ceremony. Quite honestly, I understand the reluctance toward a moment of silence at an international spectacle like the Opening Ceremony. Like it or not, the moment of silence would be polarizing and you can be sure that some knuckleheads would ruin the moment by doing something inappropriate. It&#8217;s a matter of quality control. Further, I don&#8217;t know that the Opening Ceremony is an appropriate time to put the focus on one nation. It&#8217;s true that terrorism at the Olympics affects everyone, but a moment of silence for Israel&#8217;s terror victims does take the focus off the international community and place it on one particular nation. It&#8217;s just not the right time or place. Finally, 40 is a bit of an arbitrary number. I&#8217;m uncertain why on the 40th anniversary (more than 20, 36 or 48, or 60) it was necessary to make a huge issue over the moment of silence.</p>
<p>But thankfully, the IOC is doing several other things to remember the victims of this horrible act of terrorism. Plus, Bob Costas will be leading a moment of silence on his broadcast of the Games. All in all, the 40th anniversary of the Munich Massacre will not go unremembered or unnoticed. Let us hope and pray that the message is received by those who want the moment of silence and those who need to see a moment of silence observed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WomensSiddur.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5033" title="WomensSiddur" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/WomensSiddur-236x300.png" alt="" width="236" height="300" /></a>Rabbi Julie Schonfeld makes an outrageous claim and Ha&#8217;aretz runs with it.</p>
<p>The claim? A version of a siddur published in the 15th century contains the blessing <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em>. The blessing thanks God for making the one reciting the benediction a woman and not a man. Rabbi Schonfeld contends that:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><em>&#8220;This Siddur </em><strong>proves</strong><em> that the degrading attitudes towards women, which we are seeing in certain extreme religious communities in Israel today, are a modern distortion of Judaism. Ironically, treatment of women in certain extreme sectors of the community is far more denigrating to women today than even the attitudes of the late Middle Ages.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>While I sympathize with Rabbi Schonfeld&#8217;s efforts in this regard, this siddur &#8220;proves&#8221; absolutely nothing of the sort. The siddur, which has been floating around the Internet for quite a few years now despite the attempt to portray this as an amazing new discovery, only proves that one woman had this siddur written on her behalf. It does not prove anything about the attitudes toward women in Medieval times.</p>
<p>Although, I would argue that the treatment of women in some Jewish communities in today&#8217;s day and age is not rooted in halacha as much as it is rooted in traditional, old-fashioned values that may or may not be compatible with halacha, Judaism or Torah. They are two separate things. But the siddur does not prove that. Nor does it prove that women were treated any better or worse in Medieval Europe.</p>
<p>The siddur, however <em>does </em>prove something very important in my eyes.<span id="more-5030"></span> It proves that the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em> is not as nefarious as it seems. See, if a woman is willing to say <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em> she must not feel that it is a degrading blessing. It would be extremely hypocritical for an oppressed group to turn around and use the same degrading terminology against the group that is oppressing them. It would be like civil rights activists in 1965 organizing a bus with black people in the front and white people in the back. Reversing the roles in degrading situations is hardly a fair or open-minded approach to the problem.</p>
<p>It seems, that neither the one who makes the blessing <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em> nor the one who makes the blessing <em>shelo asani isha</em> is meant to be degrading. Rather, both are blessings expressing appreciation for one&#8217;s place in life. Both blessing are ways of practicing the concept of being happy with one&#8217;s lot. Just like one can be happy as a man and not a woman, one can be happy as a woman and not a man. Even if one has more commandments than the other.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this single instance of a woman having her own blessing validates the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em>. It shows that the true meaning of blessing is that one blesses whatever their situation happens to be. It is not an expression of superiority, nor is it an expression of oppression. It is just a blessing.</p>
<p>I understand that this will not change the perception of the public. I do believe that the blessing of <em>shelo asani isha</em> appears offensive to outsiders (and even most to insiders who need to wrestle with apologetics to make it less offensive). I think the most effective way of preserving this ancient blessing is to understand what a blessing really is all about. Seeing a woman&#8217;s prayerbook with <em>she&#8217;asani isha v&#8217;lo ish</em> affirms to me that the blessing is not meant as a <em>tziduk ha&#8217;din</em> or an expression of having more mitzvos. Rather, it is an opportunity to thank God for one&#8217;s place in this world.</p>
<p>It is my hope that the public can accept that this blessing is not derogatory in intention or application. Rabbi Schonfeld&#8217;s new favorite siddur helps make that point.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/220px-Yossi_Sarid.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4998" title="220px-Yossi_Sarid" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/220px-Yossi_Sarid-210x300.jpg" alt="" width="210" height="300" /></a>I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>I read the recent op-ed written by Yossi Sarid and published in Haaretz. I found the article highly offensive, despicable and ugly. I thought I would &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisking" target="_blank">fisk</a>&#8221; the article and counter each and every one of Sarid&#8217;s twisted, angry points. I got through about half of Sarid&#8217;s ugly diatribe and I was forced to quit. I could not win. I was unable to refute every one of his points without twisting myself, Chazal and halacha into a stale pretzel.</p>
<p>So I gave up.</p>
<p>Instead, I offer two independant points in this blog post inspired by Sarid&#8217;s disgraceful article.</p>
<p>Sarid&#8217;s main point is that the extremists in Israel are only applying the lessons that are taught in our holy tradition. He proceeds to quote several sources that demonstrate his view of the way Judaism treats women. A few of his sources are misquoted. A few others are opinions of one rabbi and not every rabbi. But by and large, one can build a solid case against orthodox Judaism&#8217;s approach to women using Sarid&#8217;s sources.</p>
<p>By pointing to these sources, Sarid proposes that the extremists are just following the logical conclusions of halacha and traditional Judaism. Therefore the problem is not the extremists, the problem is all Jews who adhere to halacha. All forms of Judaism that believe in the veracity of Torah are to blamed. This is akin to one of Hitchens&#8217; more well-known arguments against religion. If extremists can follow the text of a religion and be bad people there is a flaw in the religion. Sarid lumps all Jews who follow halacha together. The extremists are extremists but only because they follow the same texts as I do, they just do it better.</p>
<p>Sarid is wrong. Dead Wrong.<span id="more-4997"></span> He is wrong because the extremists may be following the texts that he cites. But halachic Judaism does not follow those texts today. Yes. Believe it or not, even the most charedi of Jews do not have the same beliefs about women that some of our great rabbis had throughout our history. He claims that halacha prohibits teaching women Torah. This is obviously very easy to refute. Every orthodox Jewish woman studies Torah. This is an evolution of Judaism to conform to modernity. Some things are up for negotiation. Some things are not. But to represent orthodox Judaism as a whole by quoting a few obscure (and few less obscure) texts is ugly.</p>
<p>It is ugly because in practice, 99% of orthodox Jews don&#8217;t agree with the texts he quoted. The 1% who do are the extremists. Thus, is it disingenuous and provocative to lump all orthodox Jews together with regard to the way women are treated in orthodox Judaism. For this I am fuming with anger at Yossi Sarid. How dare he take a few quotes and a few crazies and paint the entire spectrum of orthodox Judaism with that brush? It is inexcusable. I hope he can find his way and retract his article. An apology would be appropriate as well.</p>
<p>The second point is that these texts do exist. They do need to be dealt with in a mature way. I am not qualified to dismiss these texts and I would not dare make a unilateral statement about these texts. But it would be wise for our rabbinic leadership (and by <em>our</em> rabbinic leadership, I mean the orthodox Jewish leadership from across the spectrum) to formulate responses and interpretations or dismissals of these texts. We need to have an approach that codifies the modern approaches that we have taken towards women over the last few centuries. The offensive texts cannot remain the only authoratative views on women.</p>
<p>It is clear and without a doubt that attitudes have changed towards women over the last 2500 years. This is not a Jewish phenomenon. Women have only had the right to vote and own land for a relatively short amount of time in the secular world. Jewish law has adapted as well. Women work outside the home. Women learn Torah. Women are expected to be treated with as much respect as one would like to be treated by others.</p>
<p>The problem is that the most authoratative sources that remain are those that are no longer followed by the majority of orthodox Jews. We need to educate ourselves and hateful people like Yossi Sarid that neither those texts, nor the extremists represent mainstream halachic Judaism.</p>
<p>I suggest you read Sarid&#8217;s diatribe. If only so that you should know what kind of perception one can have if one cherry picks from the traditional sources and to try to figure a way to explain these texts without becoming overly apologetic and without rejecting the sanctity of our tradition.</p>
<p>As much as I hate what the religious extremists are doing to pervert Torah Judaism, I hate what Yossi Sarid has written even more.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jerusalem_archeological_dig-759529.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4604" title="jerusalem_archeological_dig-759529" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/jerusalem_archeological_dig-759529-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>For centuries, a segment of orthodox Judaism has shunned science. It has been viewed as heretical and anti-Torah. When confronted with seemingly irreconcilable differences between science and Torah, the orthodox Jewish view is to choose Torah. So why bother with science if it will just cause theological problems?</p>
<p>This groups self identifies as Charedi Judaism. Charedi comes from the word חרד which means to fear. It is supposed to mean &#8220;fear of Heaven&#8221;. I have joked that it also means &#8220;fear of science&#8221; or &#8220;fear of progress&#8221; or &#8220;fear of education&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ha&#8217;aretz writes that a couple weeks ago, a Torah Archeology conference took place with the approval of Charedi Rabbis. While not entirely embracing the conclusions of archeology, the conference presented a view of archeology that is entirely compatible with Charedi Judaism. The artifacts are used to illuminate the Torah and its interpreters. But never used to challenge them.<span id="more-4603"></span></p>
<p>Certainly this is a fine line to tread and one that this community has been reluctant to tread for centuries. But it seems that at least a small portion of them and their leaders are prepared to embrace Torah Archeology.</p>
<p>This is wonderful news.</p>
<p>It is all part of a broader effort to [slightly] modernize the Charedi system to include improved education and prepare Charedi adults for a less insular life. The article in Haaretz quotes Rabbi Eliyahu Soloveitchick (who I do not know nor do I know his Charedi credentials) as saying that science and Torah can and should be reconciled. He even mentions the &#8220;E&#8221; Word. He says that evolution is not a problem for believers. He should tell that to the anti-evolution ideologues in America&#8230;</p>
<p>The money quote from Rabbi Soloveitchik:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re all Haredim who are guided by the fear of heaven, but that&#8217;s not a reason to be afraid of science. The Haredi fear of science is gradually dissipating.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It all sounds revolutionary to me and we shall see if it will catch on. I am afraid that this movement will be banned and its participants ostracized as has happened in the past.</p>
<p>But the truth is, that this was inevitable. Insularity and &#8220;protection&#8221; from modernity can only work so long as that insulation and protection are absolute. But once there are cracks in the wall, the floodgates are open. It is impossible, in 2011, to maintain that level of rigorous insularity. The Internet and free flow of information changed all that. It is what inspired revolution across the Middle East this past year and it is certainly what is fueling this trend toward science that is being alleged in this article about Torah archeology.</p>
<p>There are cracks in the walls of insularity. It is impossible to stop it. It is impossible for Charedi Jews, it is impossible for fundamentalist Muslims and Christians as well.</p>
<p>Christopher Hitchens has written and talked about the modernization of religion. In today&#8217;s day and age, it seems impossible to avoid. Adapt or disappear.</p>
<p>It seems that the Charedi world is getting ready to take that step.</p>
