<p>It seems the &#8220;impossible&#8221; has happened again. Kelly Myzner lost custody of her children last week.</p>
<p>I have not seen the court documents. Although I have read a few articles about the case and I am well aware that every situation has at least two sides to the story.</p>
<p>If you want to see one version of the facts go to Unpious and read <a href="http://www.unpious.com/2013/05/ex-hasidic-mother-loses-custody-of-children/">Ex-Hasidic Mother Loses Custody of Children</a> by Shulem Deen. Whether the facts are the way the ex-hasid community presents them or not, the phenomena is real.<span id="more-7101"></span></p>
<p>It is true that <em>baalei teshuva </em>in the chasidic community will be set up with less than stellar matches. It is true that sometimes those less than stellar young men or women have personality defects. It is true that personality defects worsen in one&#8217;s 20&#8242;s and are further exacerbated by marriage and parenthood. It is true that people who are in bad marriages will see the worst of their society and will look outside their community. It is true that people in a marriage can get fed up with one another and find themselves in completely different religious spheres. Sometimes the couple will seek divorce.</p>
<p>What happens next is the real point here.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the primary caregiver &#8211; usually the mother, is awarded primary custody. However, sometimes the mother is denied custody for a potpourri of reasons. One reason that has been used in court proceedings is that the children should stay in the same religious environment. Usually this means that the parent who is deviating will lose custody. When it is the mother, the courts will sometimes deny the mother custody.</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons for this: First, the assumption could be that deviating from the agreed upon religious beliefs in the marriage is like a breach of contract. She breached, so he wins. Second, deviating could be viewed as a a symptom of imbalance. Third, the children have a status quo of religious practice and taking that away from them and them away from it is unfair collateral damage. Fourth, the court systems are rigged and they are bought and paid for by the ultra-orthodox community. Fifth, the ultra-orthodox community projects a unified front and unwavering support for their own so the chances that the children will be cared for increases within the ultra-orthodox community. Sixth, the ultra-orthodox community pays for a super-lawyer while the deviating party gets by with a legal aid lawyer and the super-lawyer wins.</p>
<p>I am not saying that all these reasons are true, fair, or valid. However, they are all part of the equation. So I don&#8217;t think that the sole reason anyone loses custody is because they deviated from the religious beliefs. But religion is definitely used as a weapon in these proceedings.</p>
<p>My feeling is that the children of these families are going to need their mothers more than most children. They will have a hard time throughout their lives due to the disparate religious beliefs of their parents and families. As long as the mother is a good mother, the mother should be taking care of the children. A good mother has nothing to do with religion. Good mothers are everywhere, not just in the ultra-orthodox community.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be a very strong reason to deny the mother custody. I don&#8217;t think that being an atheist is a valid reason. More importantly, I don&#8217;t love the idea of the secular court system weighing the religious beliefs of the parents to determine custody. It&#8217;s probably not a good idea and it might not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.</p>
<p>Most importantly, using children as pawns in any custody battle is deplorable. But when children are used to keep people in the fold we cross the line from deplorable to cult-like. The community does not own the children. That is what happens in a cult. Parents are responsible to raise their children as they deem fit. If the parents have differing opinions on those issues, it is their issue and they must resolve it. But using the brute force of a strong insular community to win the day is just not acceptable.</p>
<p><em>If I see the court documents I will be able to confirm the particulars of this case. In the meantime these are my general thoughts.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x5951.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5392" title="article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x595" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x5951-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>It was last Pesach that the NY Times slipped an <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/31/thoughts-on-kiryas-joel-the-poorest-city-in-america/" target="_blank">article about Kiryas Joel</a> under the blogosphere&#8217;s radar. This year, the Post slipped an article almost under that same radar about a reality show featuring ex-hasids. But just because many of the blogs hibernate during Pesach, doesn&#8217;t mean that we can&#8217;t talk about the show now.</p>
<p>Details are scant, but it seems that several of our more well-known ex-hasids will be starring in a reality show. We met Pearlperry Reich and Shauli Gros on the Dr. Phil show (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/03/05/rabbi-shmuley-is-more-embarrassing-than-pearlperry-reich-on-the-dr-phil-show-and-analysis/">Pearlperry Reich on the Dr. Phil Show</a>). Since then, we have become friends on Facebook. Now they are joining forces with Luzer Twersky to tell the world about how they left their homes and their previous lives.</p>
<p>The story is familiar enough. An insular, old-fashioned world meets the fast-paced, liberal world. The results are bound to be emotional, funny, and dramatic. The show has not yet been picked up, so there&#8217;s a chance it never airs. If it does air, the stars hope it will improve the lives of the members of the communities they left. By giving a strong voice to the ex-hasid, the show might expose some of the less savory aspects of insular life. If the claims are false, the show will be a terrible pock on the Jewish community. If the claims are true, then either we should take pride in those claims or if they are negative, try to fix them.</p>
<p>But in the end, this show is a terrible idea.<span id="more-5390"></span> I can only assume that the stars of this show have never seen reality TV shows. These shows are train wreck television. The entire point of these shows is to portray uncomfortable situations and manufacture drama. No one comes out of a reality show smelling like roses. No one. Ever.</p>
<p>Put it this way &#8211; words that have never been stated after watching a reality show: &#8220;Wow, those people seem like such lovely human beings. I hope they have much success in their lives and hopefully I can be as well-adjusted as them one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, as much as I am interested in the story that these people have to tell and as much as I empathize with many of their struggles, I can only see how this show will only harm them and their new ex-hasid community. There are other, better ways of pushing their agendas forward. If you have a message and an idea, the worst way that I can think of to spread that idea is on a reality show. How about a documentary? Or a well-written informative website? Or a speaking tour? Or writing a book? Reality TV is lazy. It is lazy for its producers. It is lazy for its viewers. But most of all, in this case, it is lazy for its stars.</p>
<p>If you have a true message and a great story, don&#8217;t sully it on reality TV. Please.</p>
