				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6945" alt="130415160947-boston-marathon-explosion-08-horizontal-large-gallery" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/130415160947-boston-marathon-explosion-08-horizontal-large-gallery-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" />Yesterday, on Facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101489314937755" target="_blank">I posted the iconic photo of the 78 year old man</a> in an orange shirt surrounded by police officers with smoke billowing in the background just after the explosion at the Boston Marathon. I took notice of the Israeli flag in the background. It was hard to miss the flag through the smoke and it meant something to me that the flag was so prominent in the photo.</p>
<p>One fellow left a comment on the photo with a link to a CNN version of the photo. In the CNN version the Israeli flag cannot be seen. The implication was that the photo was edited to remove the Israeli flag.</p>
<p>I did a little digging and I discovered that CNN got the photo from Getty Images. I hunted for the photo on Getty Images and found the second photo on their site. At first I was incensed. I even put up a blog post criticizing Getty Images (completely against my nature) for what I thought was scrubbing the photo.</p>
<p>I never looked at the photos side by side. I last saw the original photo last night and I first saw the second photo this morning. They were similar enough that it looked suspicious. But once I posted the photos one above the other I noticed, as did several intrepid readers, that they were <em>not the same photo.</em> The photographer took more than one photo as he got closer to the scene. In one photo the Israeli flag is visible, in the other it is not. But in the second photo, the American flag is visible. That&#8217;s clearly a better choice for this particular tragedy.</p>
<p>Once I realized my mistake I removed the blog post.<span id="more-6951"></span> This despite the fact that I can guarantee that post would have reached 50,000 views within a couple hours. The conspiracy theorists would have loved and shared it to all their fellow conspiracy theorist friends and the realists would have come to see the post and yell at me (and them). But it&#8217;s not about views. It&#8217;s about truth and honest discussion. So I took it down.</p>
<p>Of course, there are people who will try to make this all about Israel and media bias. I almost did too. But if it&#8217;s simply not true. These people will post cropped versions of the photos to make them look like the same photo. Shame on them. It is irresponsible, whiny, and even dangerous to invent media conspiracies against Israel.</p>
<p>However, there are some media outlets that used the original photo but cropped all the flags out of the photo. I think that is acceptable. The flags are cool, but distract from the important part of the photo.</p>
<p>Today is Yom HaAztmaut. We should be celebrating Israel, not complaining about manufactured controversies. I apologize for almost jumping on this bandwagon. I am glad I got off right away.</p>
<p>Here is a PDF of my original post that has been taken down: <em>(It&#8217;s fairly obvious that these are two different photos)</em></p>
