				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago the Star-K, a world renowned Kashrus agency, announced that they were certifying kosher phones. These phones have no access to the Internet, cannot place or receive text messages, cannot take photos, and most importantly, cannot be hacked to perform any of these tasks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not troubling to me that people would want a phone that is insulated from certain tasks. Although I think it is an unnecessary measure and perhaps counter productive, I don&#8217;t begrudge people their personal self control restraints.<span id="more-7468"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7469" alt="cert1" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/cert1.jpg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>What is troubling is that a kashrus agency is part of this initiative. A kashrus agency should be concerned with one thing and one thing only. Their singular concern should be the kosher status of the food. I don&#8217;t even think that a kashrus agency must concern itself with humanitarian or other ethical issues that may arise. I have no problem with a secondary agency coming in and providing a secondary level of supervision. But the kosher status of the food cannot be affected by anything other its status as kosher food.</p>
<p>So when I see a kashrus agency entering into the phone market, I see an agency that should be worried about kosher status of food but is now legislating morality. It&#8217;s not even as if the technical skills involved in kosher supervision overlap the neutering of cell phones. They have nothing to do with each other. I don&#8217;t think it is smart for kosher supervision to be intertwined or even related to morality supervision.</p>
<p>Similarly, when kosher supervision agencies make demands on the clientele or ambience of an eating establishment I believe they are overstepping their bounds. There are restaurants that are not allowed to be open at certain hours because they will lose their hechsher if they are open. This is far beyond the scope of kosher supervision. Tell me if the food is kosher and I will decide if I want to patronize the restaurant. That is all we need from a kashrus agency. The stretching of their authority serves no important purpose for the public. It seems to me that it is merely a self-serving, self-righteous way to legislate their morality. If they can legislate phones and who can eat where, what&#8217;s next?</p>
<p>I am not making a slippery slope argument. I am pointing out that there is no logical connection between the kosher status of food and the kosher status of a phone. There is also no relationship between the kosher status of a restaurant and whether teenagers are hanging out. In other words, the kashrus agencies are already legislating their morality. There is no reason to think it only will apply in these two instances because there is no connection between these two things and the kosher status of food.</p>
<p>We need to stop using the word kosher for things other than food. Yes, the word is a general term but it has evolved into a word that describes whether food can be eaten by orthodox Jews who keep kosher. We don&#8217;t eat anything that is not kosher. Using the word kosher for phones and Internet implies that the non-kosher versions are not allowed to be used. This is sophomoric and divisive.</p>
<p>If anything, the kashrus agencies should be concerned with the ethics and morality of the actual food. This is something they have resisted time and time again. I am not recommending they get into the ethics of food business, but if they must expand their business and purview of supervision I think that is the first place they should be looking to legislate seeing as they have the knowledge and expertise to monitor and report on that aspect of food production. But teens mingling and phones? They don&#8217;t belong there at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The NY Times reports that there is a religious group that is losing even some of its most committed members because of what they are finding on the Internet. Sound familiar? The group is not orthodox Judaism, rather it is the Mormons.</p>
<p>Some people are quick to point out that orthodox Judaism is suffering a similar fate. According to the narrative, people get online, they see that their religion can be challenged and that there are many other perspectives in the world, and sometimes they leave. We discussed this in the context of the chasidic world here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/22/can-judaism-survive-the-internet/">Can Judaism Survive the Internet?</a>)</p>
<p>Mormons are finding that their religion is so nascent, their beliefs are based on so many contradictions and inconsistencies, and their prophet was a less than admirably role model, that their faith is irrevocably shaken. Some leave. Others stay and want to modernize it.<span id="more-7410"></span></p>
<p>In the context of chasidic Judaism I think the comparison is somewhat fair. The lifestyle is a fairly recent innovation, the beliefs can seem contradictory at times, and for some, finding out that a shtreimel is not holy can shake their faith. The Internet might be &#8220;to blame&#8221; for those people discovering that they have options.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7411" alt="google_1674887b" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/google_1674887b.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>But I think most people who leave and use the Internet as a tool to assist them in their journey are bothered by social issues in the community. They dislike the lifestyle, or they think the leadership is corrupt, or the allure of freedom from religion is too great. For them, the Internet is more like a lobby where they can meet likeminded people. The Internet doesn&#8217;t cause the doubt, but it helps them deal with it and sometime it helps them leave.</p>
<p>The last few days have demonstrated another Internet driven issue in orthodox Judaism.  A local issue can become a global issue. A rabbi who writes controversial things becomes international news. Further, the materials that form the substance of his controversial statements are available for anyone to read. The challenges can be found on plenty of websites. The charges of heresy can be found on several websites as well.</p>
<p>However there is a disconnect. The Internet is the great liberator of minds. Being told what to think doesn&#8217;t really work anymore. Anyone can do their own research. In fact, R&#8217; Gordimer&#8217;s original article was using data that was a week old and required a simple click to verify if it was current. Obviously people called him on it. It&#8217;s so easy to do research today. We can verify and fact check and myth bust with ease. If a yeshiva student in the Mir circa 1967 wanted to read Biblical Criticism, where would he even go? But now, it&#8217;s all available. Google is a click away. People can read it for themselves. That was the thinking behind <a href="http://thetorah.com" target="_blank">TABS</a>. Provide a safe place to read Biblical Criticism in the context of orthodox Judaism. R&#8217; Farber was trying do that. Did he go too far? Is there such a thing as too far? These are the questions being addressed across the Internet right now.</p>
<p>The point is that drawing lines in the sand while expecting skeptics to just &#8220;listen&#8221; is so 1980s. It doesn&#8217;t work anymore. People can just look at the information and make their own determination. Perhaps many of these people are not qualified to make such judgments. But that doesn&#8217;t stop them.</p>
<p>While it is laudable that Cross-Currents is trying to address this issue, in my opinion they are not addressing it at all. Instead we are being told what to think without being told why. The only why we have heard is that if we think like R&#8217; Farber there will be dire consequences. Is that sufficient? I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>The Internet is not going away. The questions that R&#8217; Farber addressed will be on the Internet forever. And there are more. The best defense I have seen so far is on TABS. The reason it is the best is because is simply because it is the only defense so far. We can lament the lack of scholars in the frum community willing to address these questions in the terms they are asked. But all we have to show for it are lamentations. Still no answers or explanations.</p>
<p>From the NY Times article:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Mr. Mattsson said that when he started sharing what he had learned with other Mormons in Sweden, the stake president (who oversees a cluster of congregations) told him not to talk about it to any members, even his wife and children. He did not obey: “I said to them, why are you afraid for the truth?”</em></p>
<p>We say we have the truth. We should be trying to figure out how to reconcile it with other truths, not saying &#8220;we have the truth&#8221; so loudly that we are incapable of hearing anything else.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/internet_censor_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7047" alt="internet_censor_1" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/internet_censor_1.jpg?resize=300%2C204" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>(Back to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/04/30/pharisees-sadducees-and-karaites/" target="_blank">Pharisees and Sadducees</a> tomorrow. Maybe.)</em></p>
<p>Today is May 1. That means that it&#8217;s the day Paul Miller returns to the Internet. Around the same time as the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/20/the-asifa-is-done-i-was-fooled/" target="_blank">Internet Asifa last year</a>, a blogger for <a href="theverge.comhttp://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4279674/im-still-here-back-online-after-a-year-without-the-internet" target="_blank">The Verge</a> decided to leave the world of the Internet for one full year. It was his hope that during this year he would embark on a year of self-discovery and return to his true self and not the Internet Paul Miller.</p>
<p>This was a happy coincidence for those who promoted the Asifa but because they viewed his journey as a vindication for their perspective that the Internet was horrible and responsible for destroying society. The Asifa even gets a mention in his article.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been one year and Paul Miller has returned to the Internet. Paul Miller has written an overview essay of what he learned during his year away from the Internet and some of the things he discovered may surprise the Ichud Hakehilos. But they should not surprise people that use the Internet and people that are aware of the problems on the Internet because those people realize that the Internet is not a problem nor is the solution is a tool and no matter what problems one as they want to be solved or avoided by using Internet.<span id="more-7046"></span></p>
<p>Miller writes that at first he was so amazed at how into he was with life and he felt bad leaving Internet was definitely a positive idea. He was reading more he was enjoying life more he was doing the things that he always felt he wanted to do but the Internet took him away from those things. In many respects the first few months after leaving the Internet with the best months of Miller&#8217;s life. But nirvana was elusive and slowly his life returned to its normal state as it was during Internet use , albeit without the Internet. The feelings of success gave way to feelings of failure.</p>
<p>It might feel good not to be bombarded with email, and text messages, Facebook notifications, but after a few weeks of using regular mail we become equally bombarded with snail mail and voice messages. While it may be exciting to reach out to people in person or only by the phone, it can be quite upsetting not to keep up relationships with people around the world who don&#8217;t have regular access to phones or don&#8217;t write letters but would have easy access to the Internet. Miller&#8217;s comment about Facebook friends is quite revealing:<em> &#8220;So much ink has been spilled deriding the false concept of a &#8220;Facebook friend,&#8221; but I can tell you that a &#8220;Facebook friend&#8221; is better than nothing.<strong>&#8221; </strong></em></p>
<p>It turns out that not having the Internet makes life the same, just without the Internet. It doesn&#8217;t solve anything, it doesn&#8217;t make any problems disappear, it just changes your problems. Our world is a world with Internet. Our lives are shared and experienced through the Internet. This is neither good nor bad, this is just a fact. There are good and bad ways to live a life without the Internet and there are good and bad ways to live with the Internet.</p>
<p>The most important line of the entire essay is this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;What I do know is that I can&#8217;t blame the internet, or any circumstance, for my problems. I have many of the same priorities I had before I left the internet: family, friends, work, learning. And I have no guarantee I&#8217;ll stick with them when I get back on the internet — I probably won&#8217;t, to be honest. But at least I&#8217;ll know that it&#8217;s not the internet&#8217;s fault. I&#8217;ll know who&#8217;s responsible, and who can fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t this go against everything that we were told last year around the time of the Asifa? When we were told that our problems are because of the Internet and that our problems that we have in our lives can be solved by removing the Internet? Seems to me that a lot of what we were told has been demonstrated to be false in the case of Paul Miller.</p>
<p>But it is so much easier to blame the Internet for problems. It&#8217;s so much easier to blame something that we can just take out of our homes and then hope that everything will be all right. We wish there was a magic bullet, or a pill to just swallow. Get rid of the Internet and everything falls into place. This fails for two very important reasons. First of all, the Internet is not going anywhere and no matter how hard you try to get rid of it, the Internet will still be there. But more importantly the Internet is not the source of our problems. Our problems are more directly related to poor education, subpar parenting, shoddy morals and values, and the very narrow path or orthodox Judaism. All those problems exists with or without the Internet.</p>
<p>I have no problem whatsoever with groups of people organizing efforts to make the Internet safer for children and for adults. But to portrays the Internet as the devil and to assume that if we would just excise this devil from our midst everything will be fine is a completely destructive attitude towards the Internet and towards our communal issues. I am certain that there is not a single problem in our community that can be solved by getting rid of the Internet. I am equally certain that there are many problems that we have that can be solved by using the Internet.</p>
<p>Let us learn from Paul Miller&#8217;s experiment, the Internet is not our problem. Our problems exist within the institutionalization Orthodox Judaism, in our families, in our education system, and pretty much throughout all the areas of Jewish life. Our efforts must be focused on fixing those problems. Placing our energies into banning, or blocking, or demonizing the Internet is is just doing the exact same thing Paul Miller did when he took that a year awfully Internet. Now that he is back and he has told us what it is like, I am pretty sure that we can safely say that banning the Internet is not the right way to solve our problems. Problems don&#8217;t disappear when the Internet disappears.</p>

It is further alleged that Rabbi Broyde used this pen name to bolster his articles and ideas written under his real name in various online forums. He has not fully admitted to this second part as of yet, but the evidence is pretty compelling.</p>
<p>Is this so bad?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not so bad, but it&#8217;s bad. It&#8217;s bad because rabbis need credibility. Creating alter egos is a credibility issue. It gives others the sense that one cannot be honest and truthful or real in their professional life. A public figure pretending he is someone else shows a character flaw because it means that we are not able to stand behind our statements. But when the fake account is used to bolster one&#8217;s real life work, the issue becomes worse. It&#8217;s a way of falsely propping up one&#8217;s ideas. Sure, it should not matter how many people agree with someone when deciding the merits of one&#8217;s argument, but the reality is that people are drawn to ideas that have approval. For that, one could say that Rabbi Broyde perpetuated a fraud on the endearing public. It is akin to falsifying earnings reports to boost a stock price.<span id="more-6928"></span></p>
<p>On the other hand, it&#8217;s not so bad because no one was really harmed. Nothing really changed. It doesn&#8217;t really matter if he was posting things as himself or an anonymous pseudonym. It feels wrong, but no one has really been hurt here. In fact, many great rabbinic works have been written anonymously or pseudonymously.</p>
<p>The broader implications of this scandal are important.</p>
<p>As a society, the frum community does indeed stifle dissent. It can be hard to be a lone voice agains the party line. It can even be dangerous. It can be dangerous to rabbis, laypeople, or whomever is doing the writing. It can harm relationships, marriage prospects, business opportunities, educational opportunities, everything. The currency of our community relies heavily on reputation and what one says directly affects one&#8217;s reputation. A bad reputation is a death sentence in the frum community.</p>
<p>These are the circumstances that create a need for alter egos and sock-puppetry. That does not excuse lying or misrepresentation. But it does explain some of the reasons behind it.</p>
<p>As a society we can do better to allow multiple opinions and views. We can try to encourage respectful dissent and not punish those who think or act differently. It is possible that we can get there. The Internet helps and being part of a global community helps. I hope that we can get there soon.</p>
<p>I also hope Rabbi Broyde can rescue his career and reputation. I respect Rabbi Broyde&#8217;s work and really admire his positions within Torah Jewry. We need more people with ideas and scholarship like Rabbi Broyde, not fewer. His voice is too important to be relegated to the trash heap or the anonymous pile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/internet-safety.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6234" title="internet-safety" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/internet-safety.jpg?resize=300%2C211" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>One of the premises for the Asifa and the subsequent edicts that have been issued severely regulating the Internet, according to highly placed spokespeople like [redacted], is that the Internet is an inherent danger and the secular world is completely at a loss as to how to deal with the Internet. Luckily, the right wing orthodox Jewish community is available to sound the alarm and protect ourselves and everyone else from the cesspool that is the world wide web. If not for the holy Asifa and the &#8220;halachos&#8221; of the Internet the entire world is at risk. [See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/29/in-support-of-the-internet-asifa/">In Support of the Internet Asifa</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/20/the-asifa-is-done-i-was-fooled/">The Asifa is Done: I Was Fooled</a>]
<p>I dispute this premise.</p>
<p>People in the secular world have been dealing with the challenges of the Internet for a decade and a half. This is not a new problem. New computers come with features to address these issues. Parents are able to attend local seminars and meetings to discuss and learn about how to manage the Internet in their lives. There are articles and books on Internet addiction. There is a wealth of material on Internet safety in the secular world.</p>
<p>Smart people don&#8217;t need an Asifa.</p>
<p>Whether or not one likes President Obama as a president or a person, he seems to have a good grasp of this issue. In a recent NY Times article, the First Daughters are profiled and the parenting techniques of their parents are discussed.<span id="more-6233"></span></p>
<p>The Obamas have a lot of rules.</p>
<p>This is their technology rule:</p>
<p><em>Technology is for weekends. Malia may use her cellphone only then, and she and her sister cannot watch television or use a computer for anything but homework during the week.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great rule. And they came up with it without attending the Asifa. Remarkable.</p>
<p>I am not saying this rule is perfect for all orthodox Jewish kids. I am saying that a reasonable rule is not an impossible thing to come up with on one&#8217;s own. The need for a multi-million dollar convention to teach common sense speaks to a greater danger than the Internet in our lives. It speaks to a lack of common sense.</p>
<p>I personally know of children in the right wing orthodox Jewish community with full access to the Internet. There is no supervision over this access. They have iPods and iPads and iPhones before their age reaches double digits. They play on the DS or Wii on every night of the week. They watch videos and play Jetpack Joyride until the wee hours of the night. I am talking about pre-teens. When they get older, they have even more access. This is just plain dumb.</p>
<p>We need more common sense when it comes to technology. If the Asifa taught us anything, it&#8217;s that for some reason, people are oftentimes incapable of making intelligent basic parenting choices. That is a lot scarier than the Internet.</p>
<p>The underlying premise of the Asifa should not have been that the rest of the world needs our help with dealing with the Internet. Their premise should have been that <em>we </em>need to look to the secular world for help with dealing with the Internet.</p>
<p>I outlined some of my suggestions here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/29/jewish-action-magazine-takes-on-social-media/">Jewish Action Magazine Takes on Social Media</a></p>
<p>By the way, the Obamas have some more rules that we can all learn from. Read the article in the NY Times.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/youtwitface.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6197" title="youtwitface" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/youtwitface.jpg?resize=300%2C105" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Adults are using social media (gosh, how I dislike that term) at a breakneck pace. Communication via Facebook and other sites is completely normal in 2012. People share their lives and their ideas on these sites and there are plenty of potential benefits as well as potential problems.</p>
<p>Adults are responsible for themselves and whatever trouble they may find for themselves is their problem. That&#8217;s what being a grown-up is all about.</p>
<p>Children are a different story. Parents are responsible to their children to protect them from harm and to prepare them for life. Any challenge that presents itself to children should be successfully navigated with the assistance, or guidance, or upon the teaching of adults.<span id="more-6195"></span></p>
<p>So when it comes to social media and children, the parents are placed in their familiar role as parents. Responsible parents don&#8217;t let their children drive cars before they have their license. They don&#8217;t allow them to choose to watch whatever television programs or movies they think they want. Good parents would not drop their child off at an amusement park and tell them that they are on their own. Similarly, responsible parents would not allow their children carte blanche use of the computer and the Internet. The Jewish Action talked with a broad spectrum of educators and asked them their opinion on children and social media.</p>
<p>I endorse the idea of having this conversation. Children need direction and when parents do not have their own experience to draw upon, the idea of parenting on the fly can be very imposing and potentially disastrous. Today&#8217;s parents are raising children in a world that is very different than the world in which they were raised. The appropriate thing to do is to prepare ourselves as parent to meet the challenges of raising children in the digital age. Social media is a particularly thorny issue as it is ever evolving. Creating relationships online is dangerous stuff and unless it is monitored and managed properly it can become a serious problem. The Jewish Action is doing a great service by starting the conversation. Even if some of the responses are not that great, the conversation is taking place.</p>
<p>The various responses are not necessarily answering the exact same questions and so the answers don&#8217;t really overlap even if sometimes it is clear that they are not in agreement with each other. Some answers are substantive, some are not. I will leave it to you to read the various responses and make your own judgments.</p>
<p>We need to have this conversation in our schools, communities, and families. Invariably, the more reasonable approaches will mirror the approach that each group takes to other mediums. Hopefully we can use the Internet for good and our children will use it for good as well. Clearly, the opportunity that the Internet presents is great. With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>In my (insignificant) opinion, preteens have no business being on social networks. Teens who are in schools that frown upon Internet use should not be on the Internet either. If they are on the Internet they should certainly not be on social networks. In more permissive environments, parents should treat the computer with rules akin to Yichud. Teens do not need smartphones. If they have them, they should not have unfiltered Internet access. Only in groups where everyone is on a social network should the idea even be considered. If parents allow their children on social networks they need to share the password and only parents should approve &#8220;friends&#8221;. Those are my thoughts.</p>
<p>One nugget worth sharing is this paraphrase that allegedly comes from R&#8217; Matisyahu Solomon by way of Rabbi Mordechai Yaffe. In his words: <em>&#8220;I would like to point out that I personally heard the venerated Lakewood Mashgiach Rabbi Matisyahu Salomon say that the Internet is not the enemy—the yetzer hara is.&#8221; </em>This it the first I have heard of this sentiment from R&#8217; Matisyahu. It is certainly a positive development.</p>
<p>I suggest reading the full article in the Jewish Action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6164" title="_" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/jpg-300x197.jpg?fit=300%2C197" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Slate has another article in their unofficial series on orthodox Judaism and specifically on chasidic Judaism. In this article, the Internet is presented as a supreme danger to Hasidism.</p>
<p>On this issue, the secular media and the leadership of the chasidic groups agree. The Internet is a Pandora&#8217;s Box for a chasidic Jew. There is no way around it. The article does an effective job of explaining why the Internet poses such a hazard to chasidic Judaism. I don&#8217;t think an honest chasid would disagree with their assessment.</p>
<p>The question then becomes what to do about it.</p>
<p>There are basically three choices that the chasidic community faces. 1) Redouble efforts to protect the community from the Internet. 2) Carry on as is. 3) Adjust their doctrines so that they are less susceptible to the harms of the Internet.<span id="more-6163"></span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Option 1 can possibly work. The Internet is ubiquitous. The only way it could work is to literally kick anyone with Internet access out of the community. I doubt that this can be done.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Option 2 is viable either. The truth is that more and more chasidic people are disenchanted with the chasidic lifestyle. I don&#8217;t believe it is a greater <em>percentage</em> of chasidic Jews that are disenchanted, rather with the ever increasing size of their communities, there are simply more people who are going to leave. It&#8217;s a numbers game. If the defectors reach greater proportions, I do believe the community will find it necessary to address the problem vis a vis the Internet. They will either choose Option 1 or Option 3.</p>
<p>And so we arrive at Option 3. The article mentions that many chasids find the information on the Internet incompatible with the chasidic life. To a large extent this is true. But are those things that they find incompatible vital or integral to chasidic or orthodox Jewish life?</p>
<p>Is mocking evolution and science a necessary component of chasidic life? Is family planning a direct contradiction to chasidic life? Does chasidic life require that the non-chasid be stigmatized and delegitimized?</p>
<p>On these issues, the Internet is bound to &#8220;win&#8221; against tradition. There is just too much compelling information out there to even hope that tradition can stave off the attacks from the Internet. But these are not necessary beliefs to Judaism, rather ultra-orthodox, ultra-insular Judaism has adopted these as new tenets of belief. But these tenets are doomed to be forsaken by the Internet generation. They are just too flimsy to survive under scrutiny.</p>
<p>When one is told that the sky is green and the grass is blue, it doesn&#8217;t take much to realize that is a lie and the person who told the lie is a liar. Liars don&#8217;t make for good educators and leaders. Tradition cannot be passed down with lies.</p>
<p>In this respect the less insular orthodox Jewish communities provide better options for dealing with these questions. There are communities that handle these questions pretty well.</p>
<p>The other issue that the article raises is that the chasidic community has some built in &#8220;protections&#8221; that don&#8217;t squarely address the Internet, but they do make it harder to leave. Those are the early age of marriage and child bearing as well as the dearth of secular education.</p>
<p>This means that even if a chasid finds things that make a chasid want to leave the community, it&#8217;s really hard to leave. If one already has a family, and one already has a life on the inside, it can seem impossible to make a life on the outside. Especially if English is a second or third language and one does not even have a high school education. There are also the the benefits of staying in the chasidic community. If people want to stay, but cannot handle the beliefs of the community, you have a sticky situation.</p>
<p>Finally, I think the non-chasidic community can do a better job of welcoming and embracing chasidic defectors. There are many negative stereotypes associated with chasids in the non-chasidic community. Even if true, they are not the fault of the people born there, and it is incongruous to use those stereotypes against those chasids who are trying to leave.</p>
<p>I believe that with more viable and friendly options in the non-chasidic community, we will see fewer defectors file into the secular ranks and more ex-chasids in the non-chasidic community with beliefs and practices that are better equipped to withstand the onslaught of the Internet. But there is certainly work to be done in the non-chasidic communities as well. We&#8217;ll get there soon.</p>
<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The answer to my question posed in the headline is &#8211; YES! Judaism can survive the Internet. I am not so sure Chasidism can.</em></p>

I was quoted in this article as well and it gives a bigger picture perspective on my position than the article in the Friday edition. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/11/im-quoted-in-the-wall-street-journal-regarding-the-asifa/">I’m Quoted in the Wall Street Journal Regarding the Asifa</a>)</p>
<p>The blog post goes into a bit more detail about the various opinions on the Asifa.</p>
<p>My position expressed in the article is a bit clearer than it was made out to be in the pervious article. Basically, I really hope that the Asifa can somehow make the Internet kosher for more people, it can give them access to this powerful tool, and hopefully they will also learn how to use it without breaking their own community standards.</p>
<p>That is my position.</p>
<p>But most of all, the last line in the article expresses my truest feelings: People shouldn’t be Orthodox <em>“because they don’t know better. We want people to do it because we believe it’s beautiful.”<span id="more-5531"></span></em></p>

(<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/09/the-ny-times-article-on-sex-abuse-in-the-ultra-orthodox-jewish-community/">The NY Times Article on Sex Abuse in the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Community</a>)</p>
<p>The article attempts to explain the reasons for the upcoming gathering at Citifield and the arguments against the gathering. It is pretty fair. I don&#8217;t have any particular problems with the article.</p>
<p>My problems are with Eytan Kobre who is quoted extensively in the article. The article names him as a spokesperson for the event. I  spoke directly to people involved in the planning of the Asifa. I spoke to many other people who spoke to people involved in the Asifa. I never heard this man&#8217;s name mentioned a single time. It&#8217;s almost as if he was given the title of spokesman just for the article.</p>
<p>When asked about who would be on the program, the spokesman had no response.<span id="more-5521"></span> Some spokesman.</p>
<p>His sales pitch was this gem: <em>&#8220;Hopefully we&#8217;ll fill the role that the Jewish people have tried to fill from time memorial, which is serving as a beacon to the world and as a force for the transformation of the good in society.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Does he not know that intelligent people all over the world have been taking precautions against the harms of the Internet over the last 20 years? Does he not realize that filtering companies have millions of subscribers without the orthodox Jewish subscribers? You are late to the party. You can&#8217;t be a beacon when you wake up years after everyone else. The gathering is necessary simply because the attendees are less likely to listen to the good, wise advice of non-orthodox Jewish experts and are only willing to rely on the advice of a rabbi.</p>
<p>But when asked about the counter protest dubbed &#8220;The Internet is Not Your Problem&#8221; that is highlighting victims of sex abuse and the protecting of abusers in the orthodox community, Kobre said: <em>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s a legitimate issue or not, and I&#8217;m willing to posit that it is a legitimate issue, are they really going to make progress on it by holding a counter rally? It seems like a cheap political circus. It&#8217;s sad. It&#8217;s unfortunate.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>If rallies don&#8217;t accomplish anything, what in the world are you going to accomplish at an Internet rally? Also, very benevolent of him to posit that sex abuse is a legitimate issue.</p>
<p>Another disappointment was the spokesman&#8217;s statement about what the gathering will advise. Every person I have spoken to about the Asifa assured me that there would be no objective standard. Each family will follow its communal standard. Some people will only use the Internet for Torah learning. Some will also use it for news. Some will also use it for reading fiction, or non-fiction. Others will use if for social purposes like sharing photos and videos. Others will use it for fun and engage others with social media. And even others may use it to watch a movie or TV show. Each family according to their standard. But the important thing is that everyone is aware that it takes vigilance and education to maintain that standard with the Internet in one&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>However, Kobre lay down the law. He said the Asifa will recommend that people <em>&#8220;block out all social-media sites including Facebook and Twitter&#8221;. </em>This is contrary to everything I heard. If it is true I am upset that I was told differently. If it is not true I am upset that this is what he told the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>In other news, the event is sold out. I am flabbergasted and somewhat relieved. They managed to do it somehow and I am happy for them. I hope the event is a success and I also hope the counter rally is a success. We need people to take action and get involved wherever their passion lie. If not for my Law School graduation that day I might have flown to New York to attend both events.</p>
<p>Read the article for yourself. I spoke with the journalist for about an hour. That got condensed into a short soundbite. As I have been accused of doing for my entire life, I &#8220;got the last word&#8221; in the article. So you&#8217;ll need to read all the way to the end.</p>
<p>If you have full access to the Wall Street Journal site read it on their site. If not, I have also linked a pdf version.</p>

The impression one gets from reading the news is that there is an impending Armageddon. The lines in the sand are being drawn, sides are being chosen, heroes and villains are being portrayed.</p>
<p>It is true that the governments of the two nations are ideologically opposed to one another. It is also true that much of the talk regarding this conflict comes from the fringes of each nation. The fundamentalists of Iran dreaming of a region free of the Zionist usurpers and the right wing of Israel (backed by the right wing of the United States) leaving the negotiating table, assuming there ever was a negotiating table, and embracing the challenge of a full blown military operation.</p>
<p>But what do the people want?<span id="more-5493"></span></p>
<p>For thousands of years, leaders of men have called their followers into war for the sake of whatever the leaders want. In ancient times, in medieval times, in modern times, it made no difference to the warrior if he fought under the flag of red or blue. But it mattered to the their leaders. Citizens born in Germany fought for the Axis Powers and people born in England fought for the Allied Powers.</p>
<p>The men who fight, kill, and die in war have the least to gain or lose by war. Usually, the people at the top, who are the furthest from harm&#8217;s way have the most to gain from war. If they win, they control more people. If they lose, they are relegated to civilian status or worse, they are dead.</p>
<p>War in the 21st century almost seems anachronistic. I absolutely respect and revere those heroes in the armed forces who dedicate their lives to our safety. It just seems to me that humanity&#8217;s collective resources should be more efficiently spent in our current era of enlightenment. When people were less sophisticated war made a lot more sense than it does today.</p>
<p>So what do the people of Iran and Israel want?</p>
<p>According to some peace activists in Israel and Iran, the answer is that they want peace. The rallying cry of the Israeli activists, <strong>Ronny Edry</strong> and <strong>Michal Tamar</strong> is &#8220;<em>How can I hate someone I don&#8217;t even know?</em>&#8220;. First of all, they are absolutely right. How <em>can </em>you? Taking it one step further, some Iranian peace activists on Facebook are lobbying for the Israelis to win a Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts.</p>
<p>I know there are cynics out there who think that this is all part of some plot to soften the Israelis so that they are easier to destroy in the inevitable war. There are people who will find this post offensive. There were plenty who found the cartoon at the top of this post offensive when it was floating around Facebook. But I do believe that there are good people everywhere and there are plenty of peace loving people in all countries. They may not be in positions of leadership or authority, but they exist. Harnessing the power of the Internet, these people can find a common voice and perhaps their voice of reason will prevail.</p>
<p>As our world shrinks, it is harder and harder to invent fake boogeymen for others to despise. How much longer can fascist countries lie to their citizens about freedom and liberty? I don&#8217;t think it can be much longer. The fact is that information is impossible to censor and good, intelligent, passionate people are finding that they share more in common with the average citizen of Israel or even Iran than they do with the crazy leaders who want World War III.</p>
<p>Let us hope that the Internet can help spread this message of unity and commonality among groups of people who are not yet friends. Let us hope that our young men and women will be spared the horrors of battle. Let us hope that we can find enough in common with our fellow human beings that killing another for the sake of nationalism or pride will be so abhorrent that it will be eradicated.</p>
<p>If we communicate and share common goals and experiences, we can change the way enemies view one another. There has never been a better time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/WorldWideWeb.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5460" title="WorldWideWeb" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/WorldWideWeb.jpg?resize=240%2C179" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>This is not a retraction.</p>
<p>I still think there are many reasons one <em>could</em> oppose the Asifa. I still think women <em>should</em> be able to attend too.</p>
[By the way, I was told by one of the organizers that there is a simple reason women are not attending. The reason is that a large contingent of Jews made it clear that they would only endorse and promote the event if the Asifa was for men only. But up until a few days ago, it was intended to be for men and women. I mention this because some people took severe offense to my suggestion that the Asifa be open to men and women. Clearly, the organizers wanted it to be for men and women, so it&#8217;s a bit much to say I am being <em>mevazeh</em> the Gedolim when I question why it is for men only.]
<p>But, during the course of my conversation with one of the higher ups at the Ichud HaKehilos I learned a lot and I have something important to say about the Asifa.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>huge of community of people who I believe should attend the Asifa</strong>. The Asifa is playing an important role and despite the various flaws in vision and execution, it should be attended by a specific (large) category of orthodox Jews.<span id="more-5459"></span></p>
<p>For starters, the Asifa&#8217;s position is that the <strong>Internet should not be banned</strong>. Their position is that the Internet is a reality of our modern world. We have it. Let&#8217;s learn how to use it. This is a major step forward.</p>
<p>For 15 years orthodox Jews have been told that the Internet is assur. The notable exception was for business purposes. The most permissive position of the Gedolim has been that Internet use is permissible &#8220;when necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people adhered to this rule. Many did not. Most orthodox Jews that use the Internet are using it for business and pleasure. That means they use the Internet to read the news, learn about the world, follow sports, share photos and videos (of vorts, upsherins and cute babies) with friends and family, read blogs (not just the ones that are &#8220;bad&#8221;), and socialize (with people with whom it is permissible to socialize).</p>
<p>These people are Internet savvy. They know the risks, they know how to avoid the risks, and they are generally responsible about how they and their children use the Internet.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who listened to the advice of the Gedolim. They only use the Internet when necessary. They have Internet in their homes for business purposes. They have no idea what else is on the Internet and that their children can find everything that the parents are trying to protect them from with three or four clicks of a mouse. They don&#8217;t know that their children are going on the Internet on their mobile devices. They don&#8217;t know how to monitor their children&#8217;s use of the Internet, they don&#8217;t know how to protect their children or even themselves.</p>
<p>I am told that these people exist. And I believe it.</p>
<p>These people need to get to the Asifa. They need to learn about the dangers and the protections immediately. Sure, they could learn everything that the Asifa will teach them, you know, on the Internet. Or they could attend any of the local Internet safety programs that are well attended by non-orthodox Jews. But these people need to hear about these dangers and products from a source they trust. They need to hear it from rabbis or askanim who speak their language and carry the weight of the Gedolim behind their advice. Personally, I think this is unnecessary, but I believe that there is a huge audience for this kind of advice. Is it 40,000 people strong? I don&#8217;t know. But that&#8217;s a question of execution, not policy.</p>
<p>So if you are in the group of people, or you know others in that groups of people, go the Asifa or tell your friends to go to the Asifa. They need to be there.</p>
<p>The Asifa will educate and the Ichud HaKehilos will assist anyone who needs help in implementing the solutions you want to use. If you need help choosing or setting up a filter, you can call them for free tech support. If you don&#8217;t understand how a device works, the Ichud will help you too. I think it&#8217;s great. Frum tech support. It will be free and at your service. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, it&#8217;s a great idea.</p>
<p>A few final words. I do not agree that the Internet should only be used when necessary. I think it should be embraced as a modern tool for growth, relationships, Torah study, socializing, and acquisition of wisdom and knowledge. It seems that the Asifa is continuing down the road of &#8220;use it only when necessary.&#8221; I hope they come around to the more liberal view because I think we should think more positively, and harness the incredible power of the Internet for good.</p>
<p>I also think that framing the Asifa as a solution to the problems in our communities is flawed. It is its own problem and has its own solutions. The Asifa will not prevent people from leaving the fold, nor will it save marriages that are doomed, nor will it ensure that everyone <em>davens</em> with proper <em>kavvanah</em>, nor will it destroy skepticism. I sincerely hope that people are sophisticated enough to understand that those problems run much deeper than the Internet. Our c<em>hinuch</em> needs improvement. The Internet is not the broader problem here. It is <em>chinuch</em>. Destruction via the Internet is a symptom of a problem, not the actual problem. Treating symptoms may make us feel better but it does not solve anything.</p>
<p>Finally, the term &#8220;dangers of the Internet&#8221; means a lot of things to a lot of people. It seems that the Asifa is in fact most concerned with access to pornography. In our very lengthy conversation, the word &#8220;blog&#8221; was never mentioned in connection with the Asifa. I was pleased to learn this and I hope that this holds true.</p>
<p>However, there are other issues associated with the Internet. Like many permissible activities, it can be addictive. Awareness should be raised regarding this as well. Jut because something can be addictive does not mean it should be completely shunned. I also think that many people do consider blogs and &#8220;<em>kefira</em>&#8221; sites to be a major &#8220;danger of the Internet.&#8221; Obviously, these dangers are community specific and no general rules should be made. Lastly, some people consider social media an inherent &#8220;danger of the Internet.&#8221; This is a fallacy. Learn how to use the tools properly and it can be a wonderful and positive use of the Internet. Use them improperly and they can indeed be very dangerous for one&#8217;s physical and spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>My advice: If you have the Internet in your home (and I think you should), do not allow any non-adults to access the Internet without protections. The best way to do this is to create a new user account for non-adults that has limited access to the Internet for the account user. The proper protection can be ensured by <strong><em>only granting access to specific websites</em></strong>. That means that the account user can only access pre-approved sites. Don&#8217;t rely on a filter. Give them access to specific, pre-approved sites. No filter is foolproof. If you let them on social media sites, monitor their friends and interactions. Obviously, make sure you don&#8217;t let them onto the adult user account on the computer. Protect it with the best password in the history of passwords. Finally, don&#8217;t give your child or teen any devices that have Internet access. If you want to protect <em>yourself</em> from accessing specific sites there is no solution other than self control.</p>

<p>There are a million and one things to complain about regarding the Ichud HaKehilos Asifa at Citifield. Pretty much everyone has read the <a href="http://dteitelbaum.blogspot.com/2012/04/open-letter-to-ichud-hakehillos.html" target="_blank">excellent post by Dovid Teitlebaum</a> pointing out the fallacy of blaming the Internet for problems within the orthodox Jewish community. I wholeheartedly agree that positive chinuch is far more effective and valuable than bans, broad policies, filters, and fear.</p>
<p>I also understand that the Ichud HaKehilos believes that there is a legitimate reason to sincerely fear the Internet. I am willing to grant them the courtesy that the imaginary Internet boogeyman is the most pressing issue in the orthodox Jewish community for a moment. However, it completely boggles my mind how they can justify, on their own terms, one of their executive decisions.<span id="more-5448"></span></p>
<p>The latest advertisements of for the Asifa are out and they proclaim that the Gedolim endorse the Asifa. Interestingly, there are no specific American Gedolim who are mentioned and I have not heard of any bold faced names from America in support of the Asifa other than R&#8217; Matisyahu Solomon.</p>
<p>The new ads also announce that tickets are now on sale. You can have the privilege of attending the Asifa for just $10.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just one catch. 50% of orthodox Jews cannot attend. The entire Asifa is for men only.</p>
<p>This is unconscionable.</p>
<p>If the threat of the Internet is so great, as the Ichud HaKehilos claims, how in the world can they make the marquee event for awareness and education about the Internet exclusively for men?! Are women not susceptible to the harms of the Internet? Should mothers of our children not be educated about the dangers of the Internet?</p>
<p>I honestly cannot fathom how the Ichud HaKehilos can say on the one hand that the Internet is so dangerous and then on the other hand exclude the mothers who are home with their children more than their fathers and the teenage girls who are just as present online as teenage boys. If anything, the girls have more access to computers and Internet than boys in yeshiva!</p>
<p>Again, I don&#8217;t think anyone needs to go to this Asifa. But for the Ichud HaKehilos who feels that this is the most important issue of our time, there is absolutely no excuse for limiting attendance to men only.</p>
<p>This is just further evidence to me that the project is flawed, lacks leadership and vision, and is very hard to fully endorse.</p>
