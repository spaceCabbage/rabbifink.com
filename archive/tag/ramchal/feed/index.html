I think it is worth reposting for this year&#8217;s &#8220;10 Days of Repentance&#8221;.</strong></em></p>
<p>As we approach the Jewish New Year there is an effort  to at least attempt to enter Rosh Hashanah clean from sin. Unfortunately, we have made bad choices, we have done wrong in our lives. How are we to start a fresh year with joy and confidence if we are carrying all the baggage of mistakes we have made. It can be depressing thinking about bad choices we have made. They all have consequences and we may regret what we have done. But regret does not fix the harms we have caused. Regret can have a debilitating effect if it holds us back from achieving our goals as we wallow in self pity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a concept of Teshuva, repentance, in Judaism. The word repentance generally refers to a person to has decided to commit their life to God (see Wikipedia on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repentance" target="_blank">repentance</a>). But what of someone who already has committed their life to God and is trying to do their best to make the best moral choices in their life but has made mistakes? Is there a mechanism for that person to somehow come back to God? Aren&#8217;t they already committed to God? What more can they do?</p>
<p>In Judaism there is such a mechanism. <span id="more-4685"></span>That is what we call Teshuva. Anyone can do teshuva and everyone should be doing teshuva all the time. Any time we make the wrong choice we have created separation between ourselves and God who is Perfection. Our lack of perfection stands in the way of being with God and Perfection. The further we are from perfection, the further we are from God. Teshuva gets us closer to perfection.</p>
<p>But how? Once we have acted and done wrong the deed is done. Can teshuva make it disappear? Is it magic?</p>
<p>Compounding the problem is the idea that God is the Ultimate Judge. That means that if an act is &#8220;bad&#8221; it deserves immediate consequences. There is no judge, no jury, no lawyers, no plea bargain deals, Ultimate Judgment means that every act has an exact and precise Divine Reaction. That is how the physical world works as well. If ones steals something, the item is stolen immediately. There is no grace period or gray area. If one kills someone, the person is dead. If one cheats on their wife, they have cheated. In the physical world, our actions have immediate, real reactions. That is what is meant by &#8220;judgment&#8221; (poor translation of the hebrew word din). There is an immediate reaction to our actions from God as well. The distance created by our lack of perfection is instantaneous. How do we repent from acts that are done? If someone is dead because of our action, no amount of sorrow or regret will bring the person back. Same with infidelity. How can teshuva fix the immediate reactions of our actions?</p>
<p>This leaves us with an additional question: While it is true that God acts with judgment, God also acts with mercy (rachamim) how does mercy reconcile with judgment if judgment means that every action has an immediate physical and spiritual reaction?</p>
<p>The Ramchal in Mesillas Yesharim provides a wonderful explanation. First, he explains that the mercy of God is that while every action does have an immediate spiritual consequence, that consequence can be suspended for a period of time giving the person time to repent.</p>
<p>But what of the repentance? How does that work? He says that every action really has two parts. The first part is the formation of intent. The idea and the desire to act are the first part of every action. Then we act; that is the second part. The action causes the immediate result. Physical and spiritual. Each action is &#8220;owned&#8221; by its actor. So when one makes a wrong choice the act is connected to them. The action is the end of a chain that hooks up to the actor. The hook on the end of the chain that is connected to the actor is the desire for the result. So a flow chart would look like this:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Actor&#8212;-&gt;Desire&#8212;-&gt;Action&#8212;-&gt;Result.</h3>
<p>The result is only connected to the actor through the desire. Teshuva is the process of &#8220;undoing&#8221; the desire for the action and its result. True repentance occurs when the actor wishes with all their heart that they had never acted the way they did. When the person truly regrets their choice the desire part of the action can be unhooked from the actor! If there is no hook connectig the action to the actor (the desire) then the actor and the action are no longer associated with one another. That is teshuva. Repentance is disassociating the action from the actor by removing the desire to act. Of course, in order for the desire to be disassociated from the actor the actor must everything in their power to fix the horrible results of their action. But once that is done, repentance can be achieved and the action can be clipped away from the actor.</p>
<p>Certainly, the deed is done. What&#8217;s done is done. We cannot change the past. But we can change our association with the past.</p>
<p>This kind of repentance leaves no room for baggage and guilt. It is a clean break from the past and allows us to move forward to a future of better choices.</p>
<p>It is the perfect way to begin a new year.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Today&#039;s class was another really informative and relevent topic.

We learned about fear, worry and anxiety.

With anxiety affecting tons of us it was interesting to find sources bemoaning the difficulty of dealing with anxiety as well as its debilitating nature.

Very enjoyable class, as always.

<p>We asked all the basic questions about prayer. We asked some advanced questions about prayer.</p>

<p>We began with a great discussion about Truth. We talked about how people fall into two categories.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This blog post is about men learning at work. By learning, I mean studying Torah.</p>
<p>I taught a class today at <a href="http://local.yahoo.com/info-20420152-t-h-store-fixtures-commerce" target="_blank">Teichman Enterprises</a>.</p>
<p>It was a really great experience and I was inspired and I want to share my feelings with you.</p>
<p>If you are looking for the Australian musical artists known as Men at Work who sing that great song called &#8220;Down Under&#8221; (the one the &#8220;<a href="www.piamenta.com/" target="_blank">Piamentas</a>&#8221; ripped off and sing to the words &#8220;Asher Bara&#8221;) <a href="http://www.google.com/musica?aid=NwPvaH7qe3P&amp;ei=QostSoOgL5WWswOe8rDOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=music&amp;ct=result" target="_blank">click here for Men at Work</a>.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what I am talking about watch these two videos&#8230;</p>
<p><span id="more-746"></span><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='980' height='582' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/XfR9iY5y94s?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>Okay &#8211; got that? Now Watch this:</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='980' height='582' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Fig44jXBpj4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'></iframe></span>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>Back to our previously scheduled blog post.</p>
<p>I heard from my Rebbe that he is often approached by men who work long hours and feel as if they are spiritually drowning because they have such limited time to work on their spirituality.</p>
<p>His advice was  that once a day, while at work we should contemplate on the reasons we are working. We are working to support a family, a wife, children, to provide the opportunity for them to grow Jewishly, so that we can send our children to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/17/speak-up-economic-crisis-hitting-jewish-day-schools/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">expensive</span> Jewish schools</a> and so we can give charity, and so that we can experience a beautiful Shabbos together and if we are able to focus on that for just a moment it can make a tremendous difference in our work. Literally transforming our mundane job into a spiritual activity.</p>
<p>Truly, this is a beautiful idea.</p>
<p>Today I witnessed and participated in an equal if not better solution.</p>
<p>Teichman Enterprises has a weekly Torah class in their office. A catered lunch and a Rabbi teaching Torah is sure to insert some spirituality into a mundane work week. It is the perfect way to integrate the spiritual with the more mundane.</p>
<p>I was privileged to teach the class today and I was inspired. The attendees were attentive, interested and thoughtful.</p>
<p>It is impressive that so many people were willing to take time off from work to come hear words of Torah.</p>
<p>Notable among the attendees was Meish Wilson from Venice and the Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>Today we learned about the special silver trumpets that were blasted before many moments in Jewish life. We learned about the root of sin and the path to recovery from sin as well.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed myself and I hope the attendees did as well.</p>
<p>(One correction, I mention R&#8217; Yehuda HaLevi in the class, in fact it was R&#8217; Shlomo Alkabetz, my error and I apologize.)</p>
<p>Today was a <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">big day for iPhone owners</a> and before the class we talked about the marvels of the iPhone over lunch. Thanks to the magic of the iPhone (and an app called <a href="http://www.italksync.com/download/" target="_blank">iTalk)</a> you can listen to the class on your computer right now!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We began Chapter 5 of Messilas Yesharim.</p>
<p>Ramchal begins to define for us the word &#8220;Zrizus&#8221;.</p>
<p>The basic idea we learned this week was the parallel from Zehirus to Zrizus.</p>

		<itunes:summary>We began Chapter 5 of Messilas Yesharim.

Ramchal begins to define for us the word &quot;Zrizus&quot;.

The basic idea we learned this week was the parallel from Zehirus to Zrizus.

Zehirus helps us avoid morally harmful activity. Zrizus helps us take action to do morally good activity.

We also discussed Sotah and some of the ideas that were mentioned in my Monday &lt;a href=&quot;http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/08/men-learning-at-work/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lunch N Learn&lt;/a&gt;.

<p>Last week we began to learn about the detriment of scoffing or sarcasm to out spiritual growth. The general principle is that one who is incapable of seriousness about life will not be able grow spiritually. This week I had planned on completing Chapter 5 in its entirety.</p>
<p>However, we got no further in the text of Mesillas Yesharim this week.</p>
<p>Instead we had a truly invigorating discussion ab0ut &#8220;seriousness&#8221;. It is tough for us to relate to this section Mesilas Yesharim. We are allowed to make jokes, frivoility is not ALWAYS bad, so how can we bring this section down to earth and make is relevant?</p>
<p>One example that I cited for a moment as we began class was the way observant Jews typically dress. Have you ever wondered why observant Jews dress conservatively for the most part or wear &#8220;black and white&#8221;?</p>
<p>Much of what we talk about was related to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/" target="_blank">this post</a>, as well as these <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/13/clothes-in-the-nba/" target="_blank">posts</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/05/clothing-round-up/" target="_blank">this post</a> as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I cannot get enough <a href="http://gladwell.typepad.com/gladwellcom/" target="_blank">Malcolm Gladwell</a>.</p>
<p>Every time I read his work I walk away impressed, enriched and thirsting for more.</p>
<p>Previously I <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2008/12/21/outliers-section-1-and-my-grandfather/" target="_blank">blogged about his book Outliers</a>, which was super. Today I am writing about a<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/05/11/090511fa_fact_gladwell?currentPage=all" target="_blank"> recent Gladwell column in the New Yorker</a>. I don&#8217;t subscribe to the New Yorker but periodically I check it our online. This week I had the pleasure of enjoying yet another Gladwell gem.</p>
<p>This time Gladwell is talking about sports and for me it is a lesson about life.<span id="more-550"></span></p>
<p>When a basketball team has inferior talent to their opponent, Gladwell has discovered that there is a great equalizer. It is called the &#8220;Full Court Press&#8221;. For a full treatment on the matter read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Court_Press" target="_blank">this</a>. <em>(Sport Fans: </em><a href="http://search.espn.go.com/bill-simmons/" target="_blank"><em>Bill Simmons</em></a><em> agrees with this and you can check out his mock debate with Gladwell </em><a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/090513/part1" target="_blank"><em>here</em></a><em>)</em>. The basic principal is for the weaker team to play defense for the entire length of the court. Normally, the defense begins attacking when the ball is 60%-70% down the court.</p>
<p>Gladwell has &#8220;proved&#8221; that by playing defense for 100% of the the court the more conditioned team physically will prevail over the more talented squad.</p>
<p>This is comparable to the biblical narrative of David thwarting Goliath. The underdog, without real world experience turning the rules of the game on their heels to gain an advantage. David used a slingshot. When an underdog recognizes their weakness and thinks unconventionally, they have a chance.</p>
<p>This is really useful information for war strategists and basketball coaches. What about us?</p>
<p>Last Shabbos we celebrated a Bar Mitzva at the Pacific Jewish Center. Yona Kosman entered the ranks of adulthood. What is the essence of the Bar Mitzva celebration?</p>
<p>Jewish tradition teaches that as a child we instinctively think selfishly, for the moment without understanding the consequences of our actions. As we enter adulthood, and beginning with our Bar Mitzva we begin to understand the ramifications of our actions. Slowly, we develop the skills to outmaneuver our natural instinct for instant gratification and we can begin to make good choices.</p>
<p>But our instinct has more than a decade head start. We begin the game at Bar Mitzva as tremendous underdogs. Certainly, many do not even participate in the battle. Many leave the fray and do not work on themselves to make conscious moral choices.</p>
<p>Those who do wish to wage this war and gain control of their sensual instincts and make choices instead of just reacting have a severe disadvantage.</p>
<p>We are the underdogs to our animal instinct.</p>
<p>The principals Gladwell has pointed out are really the same principals Ramchal teaches us in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/luzzatto/" target="_blank">Messilas Yesharim</a>.</p>
<p>Ramchal and Gladwell give us the trick we need to prevail. A preemptive attack. We can&#8217;t sit and wait for the moment of choice to happen upon us and then begin to attempt to win that battle. Our advantage will only come with preparation and a &#8220;full court press&#8221; against our inclinations.</p>
<p>The point is that all the work to win our moral battles takes place before the opportunity presents itself. We are supposed to be constantly honing our skills as &#8220;choosers&#8221; and then when we need those skills we can emerge victorious.</p>
<p>Ramchal advises us to engage in Torah study and to examine our daily choices each day. This two pronged approach will enable us to be ready when the choice between <em>&#8220;what is good and what is easy&#8221; (<a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" target="_blank">Albus Dumbledore</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Harry-Potter-Goblet-Fire-Book/dp/0439139597" target="_blank">Goblet of Fire</a>) </em>presents itself.</p>

<p>Today we moved on to the next detriment. The next thing Ramchal teaches us to avoid is an overarching lack of seriousness. Perhaps it could be more precisely defined as immaturity.</p>
<p>Ramchal says that being un able to take things seriously and scoffing anything important is going to impede our growth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moving right along in Chapter 5</p>
<p>We quickly reviewed last week and continued until we wrapped up category number 1 of &#8220;things to avoid&#8217; so as not to hinder our &#8220;Zehirus&#8221;.</p>
<p>The main idea is to avoid <em>overwhelming</em> oneself in materiality.</p>
<p>Also, a discussion ensued regarding our natural resistance to morality. It&#8217;s like a magnet pulling us towards our instincts.</p>
<p>It was a great class with super pace and as always great questions.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Moving right along in Chapter 5

We quickly reviewed last week and continued until we wrapped up category number 1 of &quot;things to avoid&#039; so as not to hinder our &quot;Zehirus&quot;.

The main idea is to avoid overwhelming oneself in materiality.

Also, a discussion ensued regarding our natural resistance to morality. It&#039;s like a magnet pulling us towards our instincts.

It was a great class with super pace and as always great questions.

The 5th Chapter is all about avoiding the things that may hinder our ability to be &quot;watchful&quot;. We need to know what we are doing before we can improve our actions. We need to avoid traps that will take our minds off of watching what we are doing.

This is in the spirit of &quot;Sur Merah, Vaaseh Tov&quot; - Psalms 34. First we must turn away from evil and then we go towards good.

Ramchal gives us 3 things to avoid. We began the first of these today.

<p>We also had a discussion about using all your talents for good. Each of our character traits can be used to help us if used properly. The question is if we are capable of channeling our abilities or if they are masters over us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we began the 4th Chapter of Messilas Yesharim.</p>
<p>The 4th Chapter deals with the method by which we can acquire the very useful characteristic of Zehirus (watchfulness). The fist step in the process is study of Torah. By studying sections of Torah that deal with inspiration and motivation we can give ourselves a much needed boost. This is in addition to the inspiration which comes standard with any Torah study. Ramchal first talks about the type of person who has already acquired much Torah and cares desperately about living his life the fullest. He needs little motivation to be vigilant in his Zehirus &#8211; he already cares passionately about using his time well. This serves as his inspiration. It is the fear of not succeeding that drives him.</p>
<p>Next week we will learn about Ramchal&#8217;s method advice for those of us still lacking in the Torah study department.</p>
<p>We enjoyed a nice discussion about the fear of failure as well.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most famous of Ramchal&#8217;s ideas is present in this week&#8217; section. I won&#8217;t ruin it for you so you will need to check it out for yourself&#8230;</p>
<p>As we completed the section we talked about practical applications of &#8220;Zehirus&#8221; and in what ares we need watchfulness. We are not rehabilitating murders, thieves and rapists in our class so where is the moral struggle for which we need watchfulness? As a group we discussed following our intellect over our instinct and areas where that may be helpful.</p>
<p>We also briefly mentioned the idea that when we make good choices they can become instinctive as well &#8211; but that is an acquired instinct resulting from our good choices. The bad instinct is the &#8220;child&#8221; within us that is selfish and is reminiscent of animal instinct.</p>
<p>What we are learning about is how to stop the child instinct from controlling us. Then we make good choices which in turn become instinctual&#8230; And that is a good thing!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had such a nice program tonight. The event was sponsored by Elizabeth Liber as she moves to New York to attend <a href="http://www.yu.edu/stern/" target="_blank">Stern College</a>. Thank you for your sponsorship and we will miss you!</p>
<p>Our topic tonight was Inspiration. Much of our discussion was rooted in R&#8217; Akiva Tatz&#8217;s distillation of some very profound ideas. The main idea revolves around the numbers one, two and three. Listen to the class to find out just what that means! We learned more about the secrets behind the splitting of the sea, why food spoils, how to make a marriage work and &#8220;coping&#8221; with the load of our daily lives. There was some really great input from the attendees including some science, geometry and philosophical thoughts.</p>
<p>All in all the class was exciting, the questions were thought provoking and everyone in attendance had a really nice time. It makes the preparation and delivery worth the effort when the attendees are so engaging and positive.</p>
<p>I hope you will <a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php" target="_blank">join us next Monday night for our next &#8220;Connections&#8221;</a> we would love to see you there!<a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php" target="_blank"><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we started the 3rd Chapter of Messilas Yesharim. Ramchal has given us the importance of Zehirus (watchfulness) and has taught us that we need to integrate this idea into our lives. What remains is the definitions of Zehirus. Today we began to uncover just what Zehirus actually is. Ramchal gives us the two main areas of Zehirus. Firstly we need to figure out what is right and what is wrong and then we need to figure if what we are doing is helping or hurting us in doing what is right.</p>
<p>We also discussed my previous <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/01/kobe-and-zehirus/" target="_blank">blog post</a> which prompted a short discussion on preparing for moral challenges and not just relying on our skill as moral warriors.</p>
<p>Finally we discussed examining your actions to see what is good and what is bad and then examining your good actions to see if they can be refined or improved in any way.</p>

The first point we discussed today was the idea that our animalistic instinct inside of us is very clever. One of his mian tricks is to keep us so busy with distractions that we don&#8217;t have time to think about our lives. We see this in our own lives all the time. We want to analyze ourselves and try and improve &#8211; there is just no time&#8230; This is one the many weapons in the arsenal of our evil inclination. It is the same idea George Orwell uses in 1984 to prevent all creative thought crushes the spirit and does not allow for any growth. The second topic discussed today was that we are promised that if we try our best then and only then we are promised the assistance of God. The idea is that if we don&#8217;t care enough about ourselves to make changes in our lives then no one &#8211; not even God is going to do it for us. The Ramchal ends off by invoking the Talmudic principle that if one does not care to grow then we are not supposed to work on that person Our time is much better spent other ways. This prompted a great discussion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We began the Ramchal’s chapter describing the characteristic of “watchfulness”. The main thrust of the section is that it is necessary to think about our actions that we normally take in advance of the actions occurring. So we prepare for life’s challenges by thinking about the potential challenges we will have and the past challenges we have had. After we are mentally prepared for all situations and circumstances we can be confident that we will prevail in those challenges that we encounter. Ramchal compares being unprepared for life’s challenges to a blind man walking along a river bank. The danger is near and the chance of catastrophe is greater than the chance of survival. I think it is clear that we must be watchful and to do this we need to begin by analyzing the situations life throws at us before they happen. There was also a discussion about how to cope with daily issues and we tried to use R’ Wolbe’s ideas about Seder. R’ Wolbe’s main idea is that Seder is a system / routine that we live by so that in case of a challenge we have a framework from which to react. In other words &#8211; the Seder is not for the sake of Seder rather it is for clarity when we need it.</p>

		<itunes:summary>We began the Ramchal’s chapter describing the characteristic of “watchfulness”. The main thrust of the section is that it is necessary to think about our actions that we normally take in advance of the actions occurring. So we prepare for life’s challenges by thinking about the potential challenges we will have and the past challenges we have had. After we are mentally prepared for all situations and circumstances we can be confident that we will prevail in those challenges that we encounter. Ramchal compares being unprepared for life’s challenges to a blind man walking along a river bank. The danger is near and the chance of catastrophe is greater than the chance of survival. I think it is clear that we must be watchful and to do this we need to begin by analyzing the situations life throws at us before they happen.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ramchal continues his chapter on the role of man in this universe. Ramchal argues that no sensible person could really believe that the purpose of creation is for our existence in this world. If you think about it, an intelligent creator would not possibly crate the world that we live in as the primary place of existence. People suffer much of their lives and no one dies with their desires and dreams completely fulfilled. The system is constantly in break down mode! No one actually gets what they want. Further argues Ramchal there would no point in creating a soul which does not get any pleasure from our physical world. It seems like cruel joke on the soul! The soul was happy to stay in a spiritual place &#8211; why burden the soul with being created in to a physical world?! The only explanation that is sensible is that the soul and all of creation is truly created for its existence in the post physical eternal spiritual world. There the soul can enjoy the benefits of all it accomplished in this world. The soul is thus willing to go through the travails of this physical world in order to gain the pleasure of the next world. The way that the soul earns that pleasure is by perfecting the physical imperfect body that it inhabits. The way we achieve that perfection is by the performance of Mitzvahs. Practicing mitzvahs gives our souls the key it needs for entry into the next world where it can enjoy its place in the spiritual realms.</p>
<p>This soul talk prompted some lively discussion regarding the nature of the soul. The soul has a mission and while it is here it is our body’s job to assist the soul in accomplishing that mission. When the mission is accomplished the soul remains in its eternal home for eternity. If the mission is incomplete then the part of the soul that has not achieved what it was meant to do returns to the physical world. The cycle continues until the soul has done its job to completion. The current souls are all fragments of the original souls which appeared at Sinai for the giving of the Torah to the Jewish people and the rest of the world. The Jewish soul was infused with its mission at that time and therefore the Jewish soul originated at the point which that mission was delivered.</p>
<p>To us humans the soul is an enigma but if we are confident in the existence of the soul then Ramchal makes a strong argument that our ultimate purpose it greater than just the physical life in which we find ourselves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we continued our discussion of the purpose of man in this world. Ramchal deals with this central issue by offering 2 options for the existence of man.</p>
<p>Option 1: Man is created to perform in this physical world as best as he can. He is given mitzvahs (commandments) by God to help him do the best job possible while he is in this world. After man dies he reaps the rewards for that which he has accomplished in his lifetime.</p>
<p>Option 2: Man is created for his eternal existence in the world to come. That existence is based upon his actions in the physical world in which we live. This world is our opportunity to carve out a wonderful eternal existence. The mitzvahs are given to us as tools to achieve spiritual greatness as our eternal existence is spiritual and being in touch with spirituality will enhance that eternal existence. The physical world can also function as tools for our growth as long at is used properly.</p>
<p>Ramchal chooses option 2 as it justifies such a short lifespan in comparison to the eternity of the world to come. If we are to live such a fleeting existence that cannot be the purpose of our existence. He then goes on to describe the inner battle which we constantly grapple with. The rich has its challenges, the poor has its challenges. The intelligent has its challenges and the not so gifted has its challenges.</p>
<p>This prompted a discussion of a number of relevant topics. Firstly we discussed how each person has the opportunity for spiritual growth when we are presented with moral challenges. Each person’s moral challenges are their own and cannot be compared to another’s moral challenges. In other words when I am grappling with a moral challenge it requires a certain amount of effort to prevail in that particular challenge. That amount of effort is the same level of effort required by another person in their completely different moral challenge. Each one of us is challenged in different areas but it is futile to try and compare our challenges with another’s. I may think that your challenge is easier for me, and it may very be so, but for that person that challenge requires the same amount of moral effort that my challenge demands from me.</p>
<p>We also discussed the incalculable reward for mitzvah observance. This is for 2 reasons. Reason 1: we must do our best to successfully execute each mitzvah and if we were aware of which carried greater rewards then we may neglect some of the mitzvahs. This is tragic because the mitzvahs are all part of an intricate system of personal growth that requires the sum of its parts to function properly. Reason 2: For each person in their individual situation each mitzvah may in fact carry a different weight. For me one mitzvah may be simple while it is a challenge for you. This has an effect on the reward for each mitzvah relative to my effort required to execute that mitzvah.</p>
