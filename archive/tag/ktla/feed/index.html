				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6836" alt="store-front" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/store-front.jpg" width="293" height="200" />As of Sunday March 24, 2013 at 3 PM, Doheny Kosher Meats is no longer under the rabbinic supervision of the RCC. In a statement released to the greater Los Angeles community, the RCC said that the hechsher was removed for cause.</p>
<p>KTLA news reports that a private investigator filmed Doheny Kosher receiving empty boxes with kosher labeling on them and a stash of kosher labels. It appears that this is the extent of what has been discovered. This is a violation of the agreement between Doheny and the RCC thus invalidating their supervision. It also implies that Doheny has been receiving non-kosher meat deliveries and replacing the non-kosher labels with kosher labels.</p>
<p>However, it does not seem that any non-kosher meat was found in Doheny nor were there any deliveries of non-kosher meats filmed. Therefore, the status of the meat purchased before the breach of protocol was discovered is still considered kosher. This is because a kosher store has a &#8220;status&#8221; (chazaka) of kosher until there is evidence to the contrary. There is only evidence of a breach of protocol so the entire store is now suspect but before this breach was discovered the halachic status quo remains intact and the food is considered kosher. Pots and dishes are also considered kosher.</p>
<p>At this point, nothing other than the breach of protocol is certain. It is possible, although very remote, that this all an honest mix up.</p>
<p>In contrast with the Monsey Kosher Scandal, there was no non-kosher meat discovered. In Monsey, chickens from non-kosher distributors were discovered on site. This meant that there was no longer &#8220;doubt&#8221; about some of the meat and the halachic status was invalidated.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Doheny was involved in a kashrus dustup when it was forced to go all Glatt lest it lose its hechsher. They complied.</p>
<p>Right now there are four unanswered questions.</p>
<p>1) Was non-kosher meat delivered to Doheny and was it distributed to its consumers?</p>
<p>2) Who hired the private detective and why?</p>
<p>3) Why did it take a private investigator to discover this breach and not the paid mashgiach?</p>
<p>4) Everyone said Doheny meats tasted the best. I&#8217;ve heard this for years. They said the same thing about the guy in Monsey&#8217;s meats. Why do non-kosher meats taste better?<span id="more-6835"></span></p>

<p>At the time this was published, the Doheny website still has the RCC kosher symbol. (Click to enlarge)</p>
