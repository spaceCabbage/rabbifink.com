				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6685" alt="3135075538_d1a2e372f5" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/3135075538_d1a2e372f5-226x300.jpg" width="226" height="300" />Last week, a friend of mine asked his Facebook friends if Santa Claus was <em>mechuyav</em> to go to Church on Christmas. I answered <em>&#8220;oisek b&#8217;mitzvah patur min hamitzvah&#8221;</em>. That question and answer spawned an idea in my head. I started thinking of all sorts of rules for Christmas in the context of halacha. That morphed into a #hilchoschristmas hashtag game on Twitter.</p>
<p>I asked my followers if they had any #hilchoschristmas, I gave a few examples, and within a few minutes the tweets were coming fast and furious. Some came as <em>&#8220;shylas&#8221;</em> and other just wrote their own rules. After a little while it wasn&#8217;t just my Twitter followers playing. People I don&#8217;t know and people that don&#8217;t know me were following the hashtag and adding their own excellent contribtions. We had a great time. (It&#8217;s still going four days later, albeit at a much slower pace right now).</p>
<p>Only two Twitter Grinches thought that this game was offensive; one thought it was offensive to Christians. To be very clear, this is not a joke about Christmas, it&#8217;s just a lighthearted way of poking fun at halacha, chumros, and segulos. In no way is it meant to disrespect Christmas or Jewish law. We can laugh at ourselves. Think of it as Purim Torah for Christmas.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-tweeters-debate-christmas-laws/" target="_blank">The Times of Israel picked up on the phenomenon</a> but didn&#8217;t really go back far enough to find some of the best, early #hilchoschristmas hashtag. I didn&#8217;t want these tweets to be lost forever so I archived some of my favorites on Storify. (Thanks Shulem Deen for the idea). I tried to use the Twitter embed tool but apparently there were too many tweets for it to work properly.</p>
<p>Enjoy! And it&#8217;s not too late to get in on the fun. Just get on your Twitter account, tweet your ideas and makes sure you include the #hilchoschristmas tweet. Unfortunately, some tweets were missing the hashtag so those will be impossible to find.</p>
<p>To see all the tweets, search the #hilchoschristmas hashtag on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23hilchoschristmas&amp;src=tyah" target="_blank">#hilchoschristmas</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/youtwitface.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6197" title="youtwitface" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/youtwitface-300x105.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="105" /></a>Adults are using social media (gosh, how I dislike that term) at a breakneck pace. Communication via Facebook and other sites is completely normal in 2012. People share their lives and their ideas on these sites and there are plenty of potential benefits as well as potential problems.</p>
<p>Adults are responsible for themselves and whatever trouble they may find for themselves is their problem. That&#8217;s what being a grown-up is all about.</p>
<p>Children are a different story. Parents are responsible to their children to protect them from harm and to prepare them for life. Any challenge that presents itself to children should be successfully navigated with the assistance, or guidance, or upon the teaching of adults.<span id="more-6195"></span></p>
<p>So when it comes to social media and children, the parents are placed in their familiar role as parents. Responsible parents don&#8217;t let their children drive cars before they have their license. They don&#8217;t allow them to choose to watch whatever television programs or movies they think they want. Good parents would not drop their child off at an amusement park and tell them that they are on their own. Similarly, responsible parents would not allow their children carte blanche use of the computer and the Internet. The Jewish Action talked with a broad spectrum of educators and asked them their opinion on children and social media.</p>
<p>I endorse the idea of having this conversation. Children need direction and when parents do not have their own experience to draw upon, the idea of parenting on the fly can be very imposing and potentially disastrous. Today&#8217;s parents are raising children in a world that is very different than the world in which they were raised. The appropriate thing to do is to prepare ourselves as parent to meet the challenges of raising children in the digital age. Social media is a particularly thorny issue as it is ever evolving. Creating relationships online is dangerous stuff and unless it is monitored and managed properly it can become a serious problem. The Jewish Action is doing a great service by starting the conversation. Even if some of the responses are not that great, the conversation is taking place.</p>
<p>The various responses are not necessarily answering the exact same questions and so the answers don&#8217;t really overlap even if sometimes it is clear that they are not in agreement with each other. Some answers are substantive, some are not. I will leave it to you to read the various responses and make your own judgments.</p>
<p>We need to have this conversation in our schools, communities, and families. Invariably, the more reasonable approaches will mirror the approach that each group takes to other mediums. Hopefully we can use the Internet for good and our children will use it for good as well. Clearly, the opportunity that the Internet presents is great. With great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>In my (insignificant) opinion, preteens have no business being on social networks. Teens who are in schools that frown upon Internet use should not be on the Internet either. If they are on the Internet they should certainly not be on social networks. In more permissive environments, parents should treat the computer with rules akin to Yichud. Teens do not need smartphones. If they have them, they should not have unfiltered Internet access. Only in groups where everyone is on a social network should the idea even be considered. If parents allow their children on social networks they need to share the password and only parents should approve &#8220;friends&#8221;. Those are my thoughts.</p>
<p>One nugget worth sharing is this paraphrase that allegedly comes from R&#8217; Matisyahu Solomon by way of Rabbi Mordechai Yaffe. In his words: <em>&#8220;I would like to point out that I personally heard the venerated Lakewood Mashgiach Rabbi Matisyahu Salomon say that the Internet is not the enemy—the yetzer hara is.&#8221; </em>This it the first I have heard of this sentiment from R&#8217; Matisyahu. It is certainly a positive development.</p>
<p>I suggest reading the full article in the Jewish Action.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_3785" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/6a00d83451c45669e2014e5f344d12970c-800wi.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3785" title="6a00d83451c45669e2014e5f344d12970c-800wi" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/6a00d83451c45669e2014e5f344d12970c-800wi-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">(I don&#39;t know who to whom to credit this photo.

<p>Everyone remembers the Malcolm Gladwell column about social media. It was the one where he said &#8220;the revolution will not be tweeted&#8221;. The basic premise is that revolutions need &#8220;strong ties&#8221; and the Internet does not create strong ties.</p>
<p>Everyone is also supposed to remember what I said about it at the time  <img src='http://finkorswim.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' class='wp-smiley' />  : <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/10/11/malcolm-gladwell-doesnt-use-twitter-or-facebook-but-he-is-pretty-sure-they-are-useless/">Malcolm Gladwell Doesn’t Use Twitter or Facebook But He Is Pretty Sure They Are Useless</a>.</p>
<p>Yet another luddite has weighed in on the issue as well. Frank Rich said this:<span id="more-3783"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The talking-head invocations of Twitter and Facebook instead take the form of implicit, simplistic Western chauvinism. How fabulous that two great American digital innovations can rescue the downtrodden, unwashed masses. That is indeed impressive if no one points out that, even in the case of the young and relatively wired populace of Egypt, only some 20 percent of those masses have Internet access.</em></p>
<p>The recent protests and revolutions in the middle east should serve as a good case study for whether Gladwell / Rich is right or wrong. I have supposed that the protests were organized and galvanized via the Internet and in particular Facebook and Twitter. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/02/01/the-future-is-now-or-coming-soon/">The Future is Now (or coming soon)</a>).</p>
<p>It turns out there is some data on all of this. Andrew Sullivan at the Atlantic has a some anecdotal evidence. (Theses quotes were compiled by Sullivan.) Here is what Facebook says about the revolution in Tunisia:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8230;several hundred thousand more users than it had ever had before in Tunisia, a country with a few more people than Michigan. Scaled up to the size to the U.S., the burst of activity was like adding 10 million users in a week. And the average time spent on the site more than doubled what it had been before.</em></p>
<p>Twitter helped also. From the NY Times Lede blog:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Less than two weeks ago, Slim Amamou, a Tunisian blogger and activist, was using his @slim404 Twitter feed to let friends know that the police had been to his house. Later the same day, after he was arrested, the 33-year-old computer programmer managed to turn his phone on and log on to Google Latitude to broadcast his location: inside the country’s feared ministry of the interior.</em></p>
<p>And on the role of the Internet and social media in general we have this from Slim Amamou, a Tunisian activist who is now part of their government:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In 2008, there were uprisings in Redeyef, similar to what happened in Sidibouzid. But back then it seems that the internet community did not reach a critical mass. And then at that time, Facebook got censored for a week or two. I don&#8217;t remember if it was related. But it was like a training for this revolution. People think that this revolution happened out of nowhere but we, on the Internet have been trying for years, together and all over the Arab world. The last campaign that mobilised people was for Khaled Said in Egypt, and we Tunisians participated. And you have to remember that Egyptians (and people all over the world) participated in the Tunisian revolution: they informed, they participated in </em><em>Anonymous </em><em>attacks and they even were the first to demonstrate for Sidibouzid in Cairo.</em></p>
<p>There is not much to add here. Sullivan did a good job making his point. It&#8217;s a point that I absolutely agree with.</p>
<p>Like anything, there is much good to social media. There is bad as well. It is a tool that can be wielded by the brave, courageous and honorable. It can also be used to hurt people, spread lies and inflict pain. There is no reason to fear social media. As usual we only need fear the idiots that use it to act like idiots.</p>

<p>As reported on DigitalJournal.com (original source: Al Jazeera), a woman in China was forced to abort her 8 month fetus to comply with China&#8217;s One Child rule. The Chinese Government enforces its arcane One Child Law with forced abortions and fines. Aside from its obtuse totalitarian nature, the result, in a society that values men over women, is a huge gap in men and women which presents another set of social problems. (see: <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=there-are-more-boys-than-girls" target="_blank">Scientific American</a>)</p>
<p>This woman was dragged from her home and brought to a facility where her fetus was brutally aborted in its womb.</p>
<p>The story is disturbing from a human perspective but hopeful for the future.<span id="more-3195"></span> This abortion (if you can call an 8 month fetus killed inside the womb, an &#8220;abortion&#8221;, was performed by government officials. The woman is from a modern city and her family does not know how the information was leaked to a Chinese website similar to Twitter.com. Nevertheless, a subsequent interview with her husband on YouTube posted by Al Jazeera has over 30,000 hits and it tells their story.</p>
<p>Information cannot be controlled anymore. The Internet and its social media sharing sites give everyone with an Internet connection unbridled access to the entire world. A message can be broadcast and heard by an infinite audience.</p>
<p>In China, the stirrings of a revolution may be beginning with Twitter and YouTube.</p>
<p>Gladwell, take note.</p>

(See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2008/12/21/outliers-section-1-and-my-grandfather/">Outliers: Section 1 (and my grandfather)</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/05/20/another-gladwell-gem-how-david-beats-goliath/">Another Gladwell Gem | How David Beats Goliath</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/12/manny-being-manny-some-gladwellian-insight/">Manny Being Manny | Some &#8216;Gladwellian&#8217; Insight</a>.</p>
<p>But when the man is wrong he deserves to be called out.</p>
<p>In a recent New Yorker article, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell" target="_blank">Small Change: Why the revolution will not be tweeted</a>, Gladwell writes that we are told that the world is in the midst of a revolution. Twitter, Facebook, blogging et al have given the people a voice that they previously had not had. This will be the medium of social change for the next generation.</p>
<p>Gladwell vehemently disagrees.<span id="more-2940"></span></p>
<p>In his inimitable style, Gladwell makes the case that there is a qualitative difference between strong-tie connections and weak-tie connections. He holds that strong-tie connections come from real life social interactions and friendships. Electronic relationships only create weak-ties. Further, he contends that the purported social changes that Facebook and Twitter have effected are bogus. (He might be right about that one&#8230;).</p>
<p>Gladwell then demonstrates that all social change generates from relationships. I agree. Read this post for more on that: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/03/human-beings-are-social-beings/">Human Beings Are Social Beings</a>).</p>
<p>Here is what gets my goat: Gladwell assumes that relationships created with Twitter / Facebook / blogging are weak-tie relationships. That is an assumption that many would disagree with. Further, he makes this assumption while sitting in his ivory tower of &#8220;old media&#8221;, writing for a magazine in a dying industry AND, here is the kicker &#8211; he DOESN&#8217;T USE FACEBOOK OR TWITTER!!! Gladwell has a twitter account, in fact he has two twitter accounts and he has 22 total tweets between the two of them.</p>
<p>Shorter Gladwell: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to use Twitter, ergo, it must be useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, the next social changes will almost certainly come via strong-tie relationships. However, social media has the ability to create strong-tie relationships if that is your goal and you use them to achieve that goal. Revolutions will inevitably occur. And invariably the revolutions will take place in real life and they will also take place in the digital world. Those who have strong-tie relationships in the digital world will utilize social media to help their cause and that will be a decided advantage over the cave dwellers and Luddites who listen to Malcolm Gladwell when it comes to social media.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/twitter1.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2878" title="twitter" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/twitter1-300x225.gif" alt="" width="240" height="180" /></a>The Jewish High Holidays (or perhaps more appropriately High Holy Days) are now in the rear-view mirror. Rosh Hashanah was two weeks and ago and Yom Kippur was this past weekend.</p>
<p>I noticed something that almost all Jewish Twitter users must have noticed as the Holidays drew nearer. Google and Yahoo Search track the most popular searches for any given time period. There is much social commentary and benefit to observing what the most popular trends on Google and Yahoo.</p>
<p>Similarly, Twitter tracks the most popular terms found in Twitter Updates (not searches). This is perhaps even more telling as it tracks what people are writing about as opposed to what they are curious about.<span id="more-2873"></span></p>
<p>The Twitter Home Page (before login) has a scrolling account of the hottest Twitter trends.</p>
<p>On the eve of Rosh Hashanah the number one trending topic was Shana Tova (Hebrew for &#8211; Have a Good Year). On the eve of Yom Kippur the top trending topic was Yom Kippur. These were worldside trends; not local trends for New York or Los Angeles (very Jewish cities).</p>
<p>I find it incredible that a miniscule population of Jewish people can have such an impact on the Twitter Trends. It is also remarkable that although the vast majority of Jewish people are not very religious, these Holy Days still carry significance for so many.</p>
<p>(Follow me and many other wonderful people on Twitter by creating an account at <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">http://twitter.com</a> and follow me and <a href="http://twitter.com/efink" target="_blank">http://twitter.com/efink</a>.)</p>
<p>Here is the proof:</p>
