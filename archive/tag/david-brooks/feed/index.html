				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/pointing-finger.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4844" title="pointing-finger" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/pointing-finger.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The moral outrage over the Penn State scandal is reaching epic proportions. In the NY Times, David Brooks raises a salient point and it got me thinking. Brooks says that humans have a bad track record of speaking up when something needs to be said.</p>
<p>Everyone is horrified by the heinous acts alleged to have been committed by Jerry Sandusky. But there is another level of disdain for Joe Paterno, Mike McQueary and the police that investigated the accusations over the years. These people all contributed to the abuse. They either created or fostered an environment that tolerated abuse. They did not follow through on their professional responsibilities. They let the victims down.</p>
<p>It is easy to point the finger at these guilty parties and say they were wrong. It is also easy to say that if we were in their situation we would have acted more responsibly. Maybe many of us would have acted differently. We have no way of knowing for sure.</p>
<p>Similarly, we point fingers laced in guilt at the complicit parties in the Catholic Church scandal. I know there is the same sentiment among many orthodox Jews regarding abuse in the orthodox Jewish community. The finger pointers always say that they would not have covered it up. They would have done the moral thing and blown the whistle. Maybe they would have. But we we have no way of knowing for sure.<span id="more-4843"></span></p>
<p>My point is that this is the third scandal with the same kind of structure. An infallible leadership, concern over reputation, self imposed regulation and policing etc and all three scandals followed the same form.</p>
<p>Someone finds out about the abuse and the information is locked down. Nothing is done for years.</p>
<p>I used to be <em>really</em> mad at people who know about abuse and don&#8217;t say anything. I am still mad, but less mad. It seems that this cycle is almost inevitable. The people who did the covering up are just like you and me. They probably never thought they would not blow the whistle either. But it is not as easy as it seems.</p>
<p>When things happen and we judge others based on what we would have done, we are being disingenuous. There is no way for us to know if we would have had the courage to act in the way we think we would have acted.</p>
<p>Hillel, one of the great rabbis of the Mishna says: &#8220;<em>Don&#8217;t judge your friend until you reach his place. [And you will never </em><em>reach his place</em>.]&#8221; &#8211; Avos 2:5</p>
<p>The point is that we can all feel morally superior but we have no idea if we would have actually acted differently.</p>
<p>Our true anger should be directed at the systems that allow such a casual approach to such horrible things. The people who are in the system and don&#8217;t say anything are just part of a corrupt system. Sure, their complicity gives them a role in the system too. But I think it is very hard to buck an entire system. It is hard to swim upstream. It is hard to blow that whistle. That is why the whistle blowers are such heroes.</p>
<p>So in retrospect, looking at the feelings of anger and resentment I had toward the people in the institutions who did not do everything in their power to curb abuse, I feel differently now. I see a pattern that almost does not allow for whistle blowing. I am still upset that they did not do the right thing, but I can understand better how hard it is.</p>
<p>But this only increases my anger and disdain for the &#8220;system&#8221;. A system that is structured perfectly for predators will have predators. The system is bad, it is to blame, and must be fixed. The NCAA will look at their system, the Catholic Church has looked at their system and orthodox Judaism has also been looking at their system. But it will take courage to fix the system so that these heinous acts do not repeat themselves and force us to count on heroism.</p>
<p>We should not need to rely on heroes to save children from abuse. That is the most horrible thing about abuse in these communities. To protect children we are relying on heroes. We should be able to rely on the system.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/51K-wRKh+WL._SS500_.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4546" title="51K-wRKh+WL._SS500_" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/51K-wRKh+WL._SS500_.jpg?resize=300%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In his latest column, David Brooks digs deep into his Jewish heritage and procures a word to describe his recent safari excursion.</p>
<p>There were two camps in the safari. One was luxurious and the other, not-so-much. The less luxurious camp was friendlier, more familial and generally more enjoyable despite the inferior conditions.</p>
<p>Brooks needs a word to describe the simpler camp. He settles on a Yiddish word: Haimish.</p>
<p>His definition of haimish:</p>
<p><em>It’s a Yiddish word that suggests warmth, domesticity and unpretentious conviviality.</em></p>
<p>Maybe that is what it used to mean, but in contemporary orthodox Jewish culture, haimish, usually spelled heimish or heimishe is anything but &#8220;unpretentious&#8221;.<span id="more-4545"></span></p>
<p>Today, heimish connotes an almost elitism of Jews from certain ethnic stock and their cherished social conventions. Certain foods (obviously more desirable) are heimish. Certain families (obviously the ones who are preferable matches) are heimish. Certain shuls (not synagogues) are heimish. In every case, heimish has become an upper crust value.</p>
<p>Not &#8220;unpretentious&#8221;.</p>
<p>Certainly, heimish people are friendly, warm and domestic. Perhaps more than those who are not heimish. But the heimish I know would put a chandelier in their tent deep in the African safari. It wouldn&#8217;t be the word used to describe a simpler, less luxurious tent.</p>
<p>The truth is, Brooks&#8217; point is a good one. There is a line. Some places are more about &#8220;who&#8221; and others are more about &#8220;what&#8221;. Sometimes noise and crowds is better than elegance and privacy. Sometimes apartment buildings foster better more meaningful communities than suburban homes. I agree.</p>
<p>We should care more about experiences and less about things. Things only matter when we have important people in our lives with whom to share them.</p>

David Brooks holds nothing bakc in his effervescent article chronicling the great succeses of the Jewish People in the modern era and particularly in Israel.</p>
<p>It is something of note that such a small people makes up such a large number of success stories. Brooks notes accomplishments as chess champions and Nobel laureates, Ivy League School attendance, Academy Award Nominations, philanthropists and Pulitzer Prize winners, among others. For some reason he omits athletics. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/26/cant-we-all-just-get-along/" target="_blank">Have you not heard of Omri Casspi</a>!? (I kid.)<span id="more-2015"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/opinion/12brooks.html?em" target="_blank">I recommend reading the article on the NY Times website</a>.</p>
<p>Brooks struggles to explain this phenomena. It is not sufficient.</p>
<p>How are we to explain the successes of this miniscule group of people who share common ancestral ties.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it can be the Jewish religion because there are so many variants of its practice and the majority of Jewish people do not practice Judaism!</p>
<p>Is it a random deviation from the normative probability of a group of people this small?</p>
<p>Brooks can&#8217;t answer is. I can&#8217;t answer it.</p>
<p>So what is it?</p>

I hope to publish the sermon in its entirety in the coming days.</em></span></p>
<p>I would like to share with you an important message that strikes me as central to Chanukah and in particular to Chanukah in 2009.</p>
<p>In Friday&#8217;s NY Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/opinion/11brooks.html?em" target="_blank">David Brooks writes</a> about the Chanukah story. The article is interesting, a bit provocative and very thoughtful. I recommend reading the article in its entirety.</p>
<p>In his words:<span id="more-1840"></span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Mattathias’s five sons, led by Judah Maccabee, then led an insurgent revolt against the regime. The Jewish civil war raised questions: Who is a Jew? Who gets to define the right level of observance? It also created a spiritual crisis. This was not a battle between tribes. It was a battle between theologies… The lesson of Hanukkah is that even the struggles that saved a people are dappled with tragic irony, complexity and unattractive choices. And he is right and the struggle </em><em>continues today.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The Maccabees fought their own Jewish brothers and sisters in an effort to regain control over a Jewish people that were spiraling into assimilation. As Brooks says, in their victory there remains a tragic irony.</p>
<p>Chanukah is a festival that reminds us of the fragmentation within Judaism. Whether it is the ancient epic struggle of Yosef and his brothers or the more current struggles between Jews from along the spectrum of politics, different hometowns in Europe, different Rabbis, different neighborhoods and even between more observant and less observant Jews, unity eludes us.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is why the element of <em>pirsumei nisa</em>, of publicizing the grand events of Chanukah is so central to its mitzva. In no other mitzva is there so strong an element of publicizing that the observance of the mitzva depends upon it. How are we to publicize? Is it with bullhorns or billboards? TV ads or  2 page spreads in the NY Times?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It is by lighting candles. It is with fire. It is with light. The light unites us. The light does not play favorites. The light knows no sides. Fire is fire. The way we celebrate the festival of Chanukah is by publicizing a message of light. A universal light. A light that knows no friend or foe. Where there is light, there is light for all. We proclaim the Chanukah story with light. We proclaim a dedication to unity.</p>
<p>This Chanukah let us reunite.</p>
<p><em>We can do it </em>and we have the resources to do it. It is time to set aside differences and unite under the themes and ideals that we agree upon and not look to our differences for fuel towards animosity. Let us look for unity in one another.</p>
<p>If we can do that, it will be a modern day Chanukah miracle.</p>
<p><em>Part of my recent inspiration: (Matisyahu &#8211; One Day). Play the song and listen very carefully to the words.</em></p>

<p>Yes, this is the song <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/11/04/matisyahu-nbc-and-the-olympic-winter-games-make-a-great-team/" target="_blank">I mentioned as the soundtrack on the NBC promo for the Vancouver Olympics</a>.</p>
