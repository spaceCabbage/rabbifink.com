(See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/04/19/the-difference-between-hirhurim-and-the-yated-a-defense-of-r-gil-student/">The Difference Between Hirhurim and the Yated: A Defense of R’ Gil Student</a>) I am positive that they were barraged with letters to the editor. Some of them were sent to me so I know for certain that they were written.</p>
<p>They published one letter to the editor. It was from R&#8217; Gil Student. That&#8217;s it. His letter was respectful and polite. He also asked for an apology. Then they published a rebuttal from Avrohom Birnbaum who wrote the original article. In his rebuttal Birnbaum demonstrates an incredible ability to be obtuse. He doesn&#8217;t understand why his article was so wrong and doubles down on his unwarranted criticism.</p>
<p>A link to the letters is at the bottom of this post. Don&#8217;t miss the letter from Mrs. Herzog on a completely different topic.</p>
<p>The Yated should have published some more letters supporting R&#8217; Gil and R&#8217; Harry. They did not. So we take to the Internet where we are free to publish whatever we please.</p>
<p>I present a letter to the editor written by <strong>Simcha Schonfeld</strong> who has been published in the letters to the editor section of the Yated several times in the past.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>An article penned by Avrohom Birnbaum appeared in last week&#8217;s edition that troubled me most deeply. In his piece entitled &#8220;The Broyde Affair and the Media Double Standard&#8221;, Mr. Birnbaum attacked Rabbi Gil Student and his blog Hirhurim for a manufactured series of misdeeds that are more the products of Mr. Birnbaum&#8217;s imagination than they are based in any objective reality. Birnbaum began his attempt at character assassination by accusing Rabbi Student and his website of being &#8220;controversial&#8221; and guilty of &#8220;chareidi smashing&#8221; though in a departure from good and accepted journalistic practices, he offered no evidence to support such incredible accusations. In fact, Rabbi Student is a respected and gentle talmud chacham whose entire essence lacks even a single cell of disrespect for any torah authority, regardless of the hat they wear &#8211; including those who wear black ones, like Rabbi Student himself. He has often taken other bloggers to task for doing exactly what Mr. Birnbaum accused him of. What&#8217;s more, Hihurim (<a href="http://torahmusings.com/">TorahMusings.com</a>) is a <em>chashuv makom torah</em>, an oasis of <em>halacha</em> and <em>machshava</em> on the web that has actually spawned seforim comprised entirely of posts appearing there. One such sefer was given to me as a gift by my (dare I say Chareidi) father. Since Mr. Birnbaum elected to offer no basis for the serious accusations he made, I invite your readers to view the website itself and reach their own conclusions.</p>
<p>I was further puzzled by level of vitriol that Birnbaum used in attacking Rabbi Student for having the perceived gall to decline to answer some of the Yated&#8217;s questions. I do not know who asked the six questions referenced in the piece and am unfamiliar with that individual&#8217;s educational background and journalistic training; however, I could only assume that his/her mentors would have been dissatisfied with the profoundly unprofessional, unnecessarily provocative and outright childish manner in which Rabbi Student was challenged. The questions that Rabbi Student declined to offer comments on included such crass phraseology as accusing Rabbi Student of being a &#8220;mouthpiece&#8221; of &#8220;an outright liar and an ethically tainted individual&#8221; and asked, rhetorically, whether Rabbi Student believed he owed an &#8220;apology&#8221; to his readership. Regardless of what one may think of Michael Broyde, there is a way to communicate in life and there are standards of professionalism in journalism. Those were not adhered to by the author of these intentionally loaded questions that conveyed clear hostility and disrespect more than any earnest desire to know. In response to the Yated&#8217;s adolescent style of questioning, Rabbi Student appropriately took the high road and offered no response at all. Sadly, as Mr. Birnbaum&#8217;s article demonstrates, the high road is all too often the road less traveled.</p>
