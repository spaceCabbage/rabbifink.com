				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_4520" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/s_nf_3897_233121.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4520" title="old Torah" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/s_nf_3897_233121.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A really old Torah scroll</p></div>
<p>I&#8217;m no scholar of ancient texts. But there are scholars of ancient texts. A large group of them has been studying the evolution of the text of the Tanach (the Jewish version of the Old Testament) for 53 years.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the text we have today has remained virtually unchanged since the 11th century. It was then that Maimonides used the Aleppo Codex to codify a version of the Torah scroll. That version is almost exactly what we have today.</p>
<p>But notice, I used the word &#8220;almost&#8221;. That&#8217;s because it is not exactly the same. Or it might not be exact. There are several nuances that differentiate the standard Torah scroll used in the majority of Jewish communities from the Yemenite Torah text tradition. They can&#8217;t both be exactly the same as the text codified by Maimonides.<span id="more-4518"></span></p>
<p>Certainly the Talmud seems to indicate that they had a different version. The Talmud in Kiddushin gives specific places as the middle of the text and the number of words and letters. None of those are consistent with our text. In several places various rishonim (Medieval commentators) indicate that there were small differences between the Torah scrolls among their peers. Other rishonim stated that the text was deliberately changed by later prophets in certain instances. They were permitted to do so as long as none of the Torah&#8217;s laws were affected by their changes.</p>
<p>None of the differences that have been recorded are significant enough to change the law. None of the discrepancies have an effect of the theology or religion of the Torah. Yet, there has emerged a &#8220;sacred belief&#8221; that the Torah remains unchanged over the 3000 years since the Revelation at Sinai.</p>
<p>This is quite obviously impossible.</p>
<p>A massive project in Israel is charting all the extant versions of the text and their collective history. They are using every possible version and manuscript to show any and all minor differences between each version. The Aleppo Codex is the starting point for the project and all differences are being compared to that version.</p>
<p>And there are differences. It is impossible to pretend otherwise. But this should not be a problem for believers in orthodox Judaism. There are several acceptable approaches to the issues raised by the variations in the text. Each approach appeals to different styles within orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>1) Hashgacha pratis. God runs the world. Whatever changes that have evolved are part of a grand Master Plan.</p>
<p>2) Lo bashamayim hi. &#8220;The Torah is not in the Heavens&#8221;. Once the Torah was given to Man, it was understood that there would be mistakes. We do our best to avoid mistakes, but errors are inevitable and it cannot be legitimately stated that our version is perfect.</p>
<p>3) Torah She&#8217;Baal Peh is primary. The truth is that we do not live our lives as orthodox Jews based on the Written Law as much as we lived based on its interpretation in the Oral Law. Mistakes in the Written Law have no real bearing on a Jewish life based on the Oral Law.</p>
<p>Certainly each of these positions is more nuanced and broad than the one or two sentence headlines mentioned here. The point is that approaches exist and we should not be afraid of them.</p>
<p>What about the 8th principle of faith according to the Rambam?</p>

<p>The IBM supercomputer that was awesome at Jeopardy. I mocked the idea of spending that much money and energy on a computer that could beat humans at a game show. (see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/01/14/watch-a-computer-beat-the-best-humans-at-jeopardy/" target="_blank">Watch a Computer Beat the Best Humans at Jeopardy</a>). The criticism was warranted because of course Watson wasn&#8217;t just built for Jeopardy.</p>
<p>Of course, I knew that. I still thought it was funny that such a big deal was made about a computer that was awesome at Jeopardy.<span id="more-4278"></span></p>
<p>One commenter (<a href="http://sofhamizrach.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Avraham Bronstein</a>) quoted an article that indicated that Watson was being developed for health care.</p>
<p>The AP is reporting that they were present for a demonstration of Watson helping to diagnose a medical problem. It&#8217;s really a perfect fit for Watson. A human doctor can only remember so much in his or her puny human brain. Watson&#8217;s massive digital storage can &#8220;remember&#8221; almost infinite amounts of information. Watson is much better equipped to make a complex diagnosis than a doctor.</p>
<p>Watson will make suggestions to doctors and rank them by how likely they are to be correct. Working in tandem with human doctors will make a medical dream team.</p>
<p>In fact, not only will Watson &#8220;know&#8221; all the information that scientists, medical professionals have published, Watson will also know about personal medical anecdotes by reading blogs. I think that is the coolest thing ever. There are tons of personal blogs where people write about their medical conditions and of course no doctor could read them all or even parse out the valuable information. But Watson can.</p>
<p>Also, since Watson works with voice recognition technology, any doctor can use it. You don&#8217;t need to be trained to use Watson. You just talk.</p>
<p>Kudos to IBM for this amazing innovation. I hope that we will be seeing Watson in hospitals and doctor offices sometime soon. The AP is reporting it will be about two years before they will begin marketing Watson to the medical community.</p>
<p>I sure hope so.</p>

The menu is a typical menu except the prices are just recommendations. There is no set price for the food and patrons are expected to pay what they feel is a fair price for their meal.</p>
<p>The profits from the non-profit restaurant are used to provide job training for troubled teens.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to be cynical about this kind of operation. It seems so easy for folks to take advantage of the restaurant. But it seems they do not. The restaurant operates at about 80% of the retail stores and most people pay more than the suggested donation amount.<span id="more-4249"></span></p>
<p>Some people who are not able to afford the food spend time volunteering at the restaurant to pay off their bill. They don&#8217;t have to, they just want to. The store is always busy and the rules of the game are explained to each patron. There are signs, but no one reads the signs. So typical.</p>
<p>Of course some people do game the system. This is to be expected and is unfortunate. But they aren&#8217;t doing anything wrong, per se.</p>
<p>The article expresses hope that this could restore faith in humanity. Well, wouldn&#8217;t that be nice. But was faith in humanity ever lost?</p>
<p>Anyway, this whole thing reminded me of the parable in the Talmud (or is it Midrash or is it from the Dubno Maggid) (if you have a source send it my way). The Jewish community was asked to give a present to the newly coronated king. They decided to all contribute samples of their best wines in a huge barrel (sounds terrible, I know). The wine would be presented to the king. The new king wasn&#8217;t very popular and many of the people in the community didn&#8217;t want to contribute to the king&#8217;s gift. The first fellow came to donate his wine but secretly he had poured in some water. He reasoned that a little bit of water wouldn&#8217;t be detected in a huge barrel with hundreds of gallons of wine. The second fellow also brought only water. His reasoning was just like the first fellow. Eventually each person came and made their donations. The barrel was brought to the king, they cracked open the spigot and lo and behold it was an entire barrel of water.</p>
<p>Lesson?</p>
<p>Panera&#8217;s non-profit wouldn&#8217;t have worked with those guys&#8230;</p>
