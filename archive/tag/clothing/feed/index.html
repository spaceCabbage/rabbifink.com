				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/school-bus.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4580" title="school-bus" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/school-bus.jpg?resize=284%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Schools are back in session. For many, the most important part of school is&#8230; what to wear!</p>
<p>Most orthodox Jewish schools have uniforms for the girls and strict dress codes for the boys.</p>
<p>Parents and pupils are known to complain about the limited options for what to wear to school. Girls feel especially limited because there are many schools with very strict rules about accessorizing. (There are exceptions. My father&#8217;s school has a dress code and allows accessories.)</p>
<p>Limiting what girls may and may not wear solves some potential issues but raises another set of issues. Downplaying the individuality of each girl can harm girls&#8217; confidence. Making every girl dress the same can also hinder a teacher&#8217;s ability to pick up on social or hygienic issues among the students.</p>
<p>But most of all, I think girls like getting dressed. It&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s a chance to express one&#8217;s self. Taking away that self expression is a side effect worth considering.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is a problem exclusive to orthodox Jewish schools, I recently learned that many other schools also have dress codes or uniforms and they are dealing with the same issues.<span id="more-4579"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times has an article about how schools are becoming more lax with their dress codes to allow more accessorizing and individuality. Some schools are allowing leggings or yoga pants underneath the mandatory skirts. Uniform manufacturers are also tailoring their clothes to be more flattering. It&#8217;s important that kids feel good about how they look and how they dress. These are all good developments.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest boon of all is the chance for teens to &#8220;rebel within the rules&#8221;. They can dress more quirky or different without breaking the rules. This is an important way to allow teens to breathe and feel freedom. Not all teens feel the need to rebel. Others may rebel outside the rules. But there is certainly a group that feels a need to rebel and is willing to do so within the rules.</p>
<p>Giving students an outlet to release some of their teen angst would be a wise idea for the orthodox Jewish schools as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You thought I was done with <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/05/clothing-round-up/" target="_blank">clothes</a>?</p>
<p>Not at all. The NBA had huge image issue a few years back. The image issue resulted from a few<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vugHaNQPnBs&amp;feature=related" target="_blank"> on the court</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alGfuK1iGtE" target="_blank">incidents</a> along with the perception that<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_culture" target="_blank"> hip-hop culture</a> was a) <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/mar/27/20040327-095853-4500r/" target="_blank">dangerous</a> b) a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11188-2004Nov24.html" target="_blank">major part of the NBA</a> players lives&#8217;.</p>
<p>Commissioner David Stern sought to change the culture of the NBA as well as the public&#8217;s perception of the NBA. Stern enacted a dress code.<span id="more-347"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>1. General Policy: Business Casual</p>
<p>Players are required to wear Business Casual attire whenever they are engaged in team or league business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business Casual&#8221; attire means</p>
<p>•    A long or short-sleeved dress shirt (collared or turtleneck), and/or a sweater.<br />
•    Dress slacks, khaki pants, or dress jeans.<br />
•    Appropriate shoes and socks, including dress shoes, dress boots, or other presentable shoes, but not including sneakers, sandals, flip-flops, or work boots.</p>
<p>2. Exceptions to Business Casual</p>
<p>There are the following exceptions to the general policy of Business Casual attire:</p>
<p>a. Players In Attendance At Games But Not In Uniform</p>
<p>•    Sport Coat<br />
•    Dress shoes or boots, and socks</p>
<p>b. Players Leaving the Arena</p>
<p>Players leaving the arena may wear either Business Casual attire or neat warm-up suits issued by their teams.</p>
<p>c. Special Events or Appearances</p>
<p>Teams can make exceptions to the Business Casual policy for special events or player appearances where other attire is appropriate &#8212; e.g., participation in a basketball clinic.</p>
<p>3. Excluded Items</p>
<p>The following is a list of items that players are not allowed to wear at any time while on team or league business:</p>
<p>•    Sleeveless shirts<br />
•    Shorts<br />
•    T-shirts, jerseys, or sports apparel (unless appropriate for the event (e.g., a basketball clinic), team-identified, and approved by the team)<br />
•    Headgear of any kind while a player is sitting on the bench or in the stands at a game, during media interviews, or during a team or league event or appearance (unless appropriate for the event or appearance, team-identified, and approved by the team)<br />
•    Chains, pendants, or medallions worn over the player&#8217;s clothes<br />
•    Sunglasses while indoors<br />
•    Headphones (other than on the team bus or plane, or in the team locker room)</p></blockquote>
<p>This was met with serious opposition. Players <a href="http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/9730334/" target="_blank">claimed the dress code was racist.</a> <a href="http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2005/10/26/Sports/Nba-Dress.Code.Shows.Stern.Out.Of.Touch-1034316.shtml" target="_blank">Others</a> just thought David Stern was &#8220;out of touch&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, vindication is sweet. ESPN columnist <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3898919" target="_blank">Ric Bucher writes</a> the that effects of the dress code have carried over into the personal lives of the NBA players. Not only do players <em>look</em> more professional, they also <em>act</em> more professional. This has influenced the cars they drive, the food they eat and the way they dress even not while under the watchful eye of the NBA. I recommend reading all linked articles &#8211; especially this one!</p>
<p>Of course we would <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/03/the-clothes-make-or-break-the-man-connections-2209/" target="_blank">expect nothing else</a>. When one is dressed professionally they are more likely to act professionally. The clothing influences our attitudes and our feelings. The NBA is another clear example of this phenomenon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last couple of weeks I have blogged about wearing <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/29/shortcuts/" target="_blank">shorts while playing basketball</a> and then I blogged about the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/02/our-more-casual-president/" target="_blank">new dress code in the White House</a> and then on Monday night I spoke about <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/03/the-clothes-make-or-break-the-man-connections-2209/" target="_blank">the power of clothes and Tzitzis</a>. It makes me think I should blog exclusively about clothes. I was trying to avoid more clothes posts but for some reason I could not resist.</p>
<p>No, I am not searching the web for articles about how to dress. Yet, they keep on finding me. This time I was reading the Wall Street Journal and I found <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123380523253950975.html" target="_blank">this article</a>. The article is about a very shmanzty law firm called <a href="http://www.bickelbrewer.com/index.php?id=the_firm" target="_blank">Bickel &amp; Brewer</a>.</p>
<p>Bickel &amp; Brewer has a tradition of formal dress in the workplace. They believe that clothes do influence our attitudes. They believe that high-powered lawyers (whatever that means) should look like high-powered lawyers. Apparently, in times of economic uncertainty the first to go are the ones who dress casually. Interesting.</p>
<p><span id="more-322"></span>The Partners at the firm tutor the young associates on the finer aspects of dressing formally. Shiny shoes, starched dress shirts, dark suits and ties are the uniform of this law firm.</p>
<p>The idea of wearing casual clothes to work abhors the partners. One of the partners, Mr. Gardner says: &#8220;It&#8217;s actually a little offensive to my sense of style,&#8221;. Without a suit, he says, &#8220;I would feel like a football player who ran out on the field without his shoulder pads.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reports that business is good for formal clothiers. The White House won&#8217;t need to bail them out, but maybe they should check them out. We don&#8217;t want our president on the football field without his <a href="http://www.footballamerica.com/football/productDesc.do?productDesc=14143" target="_blank">shoulder pads</a>&#8230;</p>

<p>We learned about the numbers 6, 7 and 8 in Judaism and eventually we got to Tzitzis. We learned how Tzitzis can help us avoid the danger zone associated with clothing. There was an in depth treatment of how Tzitzis are made and what their construction requirements teach us.</p>
<p>We also talked about the difference between the Nazi form of Anti-Semitism and the Ancient Greek form of Anti-Semitism. The Ancient Greeks wanted us <em>to be like them</em> and forget Torah. The Nazis wanted us destroyed <em>because we not</em> like them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have noticed I steer clear of politics. This post is NOT about politics. It is about the last three presidents. It is more about their attitudes than anything else. Again, this is not about politics.</p>
<p>Even before<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/29/us/politics/29whitehouse.html?_r=1&amp;em" target="_blank"> this New York Times article</a> hit the streets I had made the same observation. It seems that Presidents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama" target="_blank">Obama</a> and Bush differ on more than just politics. President Obama&#8217;s White House has a decidedly different feel.</p>
<p><span id="more-303"></span></p>
<p>The article mentions different dress codes and different schedules. I remember when<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" target="_blank"> President Bush </a>took office there was much fanfare about his changes in the White House as well. In fact I was able to find a New York Times article from 2001 written shortly after President Bush took office. The <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02E3D8123AF932A25750C0A9679C8B63" target="_blank">article</a> about President Bush lauds the new regime (at the time) for returning formality to the White House. Meetings ended on schedule, aides were well dressed formal rules of cordiality were expected and the atmosphere was a professional one. This was a stark contrast to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton" target="_blank">Clinton</a> years where the Government reflected the freewheeling president. Bush sought to put respect back into the Presidency. He followed a president that many found it hard to respect. Bush used the dress code to symbolize that break.</p>
<p>President Obama is breaking off from President Bush&#8217;s formality. The dress code is gone and Mr. President himself is often at meetings with his jacket off. His day starts later and he is frequently seen wandering the halls of the White House. Very informal. Obama follows a president who many felt was too stubborn. Obama is trying to make a break from the Bush presidency. He too is using the dress code to symbolize that break.</p>
<p>I also find it fascinating that these 2 New York Times articles are so similar in their tone. They are excited about the change and think the new way is so great while the old way was ineffective. That is the power of the media. They know how to make good news bad news and bad news good news.</p>
<p>All this dress code talk has absolutely nothing to do with the success or failures of being a president. This has nothing to do with foreign policy, economics or size of the government. What we are noting here is the difference in office structure and atmosphere. I am all for casual; I prefer casual. However, I do think that the highest ranking civilian in our country should be more formal. I am  little disappointed that the new president has changed the dress code and is now less formal. I remember feeling just the opposite when Bush reversed the Clinton dress code. My opinion is unrelated to any other area of his presidency. I just wish he would have kept the jeans wearing aides out.</p>
<p>The way we dress influences how we act. When you are dressed formally you are more likely to act formally. I want my president formal. Call me old-fashioned but that&#8217;s just me&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the home page for <a href="http://espn.go.com/" target="_blank">ESPN.com</a> I noticed a new article by <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/keyword/search?searchString=Paul_Lukas" target="_blank">Paul Lukas</a> of <a href="http://www.uniwatchblog.com/" target="_blank">Uni Watch</a> fame. Lukas writes about the nuances and idiosyncrasies of sports uniforms.He notices everything from commemorative patches to new piping along the sides of a jersey. Nothing gets past the ever watchful eye of Uni Watch.</p>
<p>The article that caught my eye was about a <a href="http://www.gcupci.org/" target="_blank">religious Pentecostal high school</a> basketball team. Turns out these guys don&#8217;t wear shorts. Ever. Including basketball games. Immediately I was reminded of my elementary school days.</p>
<p><span id="more-299"></span>I went to a <a href="http://www.ashar.org/" target="_blank">religious Jewish elementary school</a> (in a previous incarnation of the school, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/tag/rabbi-aaron-fink/" target="_blank">my father</a> was the Dean). We had a basketball team and we did wear shorts but one teammate of ours was a little more spiritual than the rest of us and he did not wear shorts. There is an element of modesty involved in not wearing shorts and this fellow was very sensitive to maintaining that level of modesty. Eventually this guy has gone on to be a very big Torah scholar and is now teaching in a Yeshiva. (It&#8217;s not because he did not wear shorts, he was on that path regardless.)</p>
<p>Gate City Christian teaches the traditional Bible concept that it is more respectful to dress in a more respectful way and this includes on the basketball court. Morals shouldn&#8217;t disappear (or even hide) when we get on the field or court. The Talmud says that a person can be judged by three things. B&#8217;kisso (his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miser" target="_blank">money</a>), B&#8217;kaaso (his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger" target="_blank">temper</a>) and B&#8217;koso (his cup &#8211; meaning when he / if he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage" target="_blank">drinks</a>). I had a teacher who once added &#8211; B&#8217;Kaduro (with his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports" target="_blank">ball playing</a>). The message these kids are being taught is the same. The school teaches them to act modestly in their lives and the ball field or court is no different. I think that is a great lesson.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/090128" target="_blank">article</a> then proceeds to discuss other modifications of traditional basketball attire for religious purposes. A religious Jewish girls high school basketball team is featured because they only wear skirts. In fact the team name is the &#8220;Skirts&#8221;. They are actually pretty good according to the article. Observant Jewish women traditionally wear skirts below the knee and make sure that they are covered from the neck down to the knee. As the article mentions this is to help the person focus on their inner self and help others recognize them for who they are not how they are dressed.</p>
<p>The idea of modesty in Judaism is to help promote focusing on the true person by removing additional distractions from finding that true person. In a materialistic and hedonistic world we are easily distracted by superficial outer beauty so we promote the inner beauty by minimizing those distractions. More profoundly is the idea that the greater something is &#8211; the more concealed it is. We discussed this at length in a <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/05/beauty-is-it-more-than-skin-deep-connections-1509/" target="_blank">Connections </a>about beauty. I recommend checking that out!</p>
<p>What is great is that the article presented the concept in a very refreshing way. I think people that read the article will come away with an appreciation for the Torah concept of modesty (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/05/beauty-is-it-more-than-skin-deep-connections-1509/" target="_blank">listen to the class</a> for an understanding of what that is all about) and I think that is just great!</p>
