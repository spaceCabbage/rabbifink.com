				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of my favorite NBA personalities is Andrew Bynum. Once a failed experiment, then a success, then an All-Star with Hall of Fame potential, then an injury prone unlucky victim, then a lazy, misunderstood, talented enigma, until he finally became a money saving midseason cap casualty. It&#8217;s doubtful he will ever play basketball in the NBA again. Bynum, all 7 feet of him, all 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 2 blocks as the third or fourth option on the Lakers, is likely done.</p>
<p>People who don&#8217;t understand Bynum will talk about his lack of work ethic as the reason he was a failure. Others will talk about immaturity. Some will talk about his irreverence for &#8220;the game.&#8221;</p>
<p>But these are all flawed narratives that explain things in the typical soundbite manner we have become accustomed to hearing instead of actual analysis and critical thinking.<span id="more-8017"></span></p>
<p>I became a Lakers fan around the time that Bynum was drafted. That was when the Lakers were as awful as they are now and I had just moved back to LA for our second stint here. (Growing up, we didn&#8217;t follow the NBA because we didn&#8217;t have cable and neither Buffalo nor Baltimore had an NBA team.) I was so intrigued by Andrew Bynum and I followed him very closely while he was on the Lakers and beyond. Bynum is precisely the sort of phenomenon that is not able to be broken down into a soundbite and this is precisely why he is so misunderstood.</p>
<p>Andrew Bynum was drafted when he was 17 years old. He was the youngest player ever drafted to the NBA. He was also the youngest to ever play in an NBA game. He was quite literally a child when his professional career began. He didn&#8217;t play a lot of basketball in high school. Bynum played in 32 games over his entire non-professional career. When he was drafted, he was so raw that he actually barely knew how to play basketball. Bynum was a huge project. He was never a sure thing and until 2010, Kobe Bryant thought he was a project not worth investing in.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Andrew-Bynum-tries-to-dunk-on-Drew-Gooden.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8018" alt="Andrew Bynum tries to dunk on Drew Gooden" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Andrew-Bynum-tries-to-dunk-on-Drew-Gooden.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But the Lakers disagreed with Kobe. Bynum was a worthwhile project and they hired the great Kareem Abdul Jabbar to teach Bynum how to play Center. By almost all accounts, Bynum worked really hard with KAJ to develop his game. It wasn&#8217;t hard to see his progress. He began to play extremely well in 2007-2008 (I can still see the Farmar to Bynum lobs as they destroyed the second units of other teams in those early years) until an injury forced him to undergo surgery. Bynum returned in 2008-2009 and played well until another injury forced him back into surgery and out of the lineup. The next two seasons he played at an all-star level until he injured his knees again. He trudged through those seasons despite his injuries playing a major role in back to back Lakers championships. By this point, Kobe was duly impressed with Bynum and the future was bright in Lakerland. The Lakers then turned Bynum into Howard for a season. If we are being honest, Howard never played as well as Bynum played in his one season in LA.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that Bynum worked hard to come back from all those injuries. It&#8217;s also clear that he developed his game tremendously over the years. A couple seasons ago, he was the best back-to-the-basket player in the NBA and comparisons to Dwight Howard were reasonable. Shaq considered Bynum a better Center. I actually preferred Bynum over Howard because he could create his own shot, averaged numbers on par with Howard as the third option on his team, and was younger.</p>
<p>So if Bynum had work ethic, and Bynum was growing as a player, why does the narrative say otherwise?</p>
<p>There are reasons. Like the time he postponed surgery to attend the 2010 World Cup. Or the time he said there are banks in every city in response to a question about playing for the Lakers vs. other teams. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/07/21/andrew-bynum-parks-in-an-illegal-spot-and-teaches-us-about-secular-laws-vs-religious-laws/" target="_blank">Or the time he parked in a handicapped spot</a>. He was extremely candid in interviews with the media. Some found this to be irreverent and disrespectful at time. All of this was before he was 24 years old. What were you like at 24?</p>
<p>But the real reason is because Bynum is actually wired differently than other athletes. Bynum does not fit into the typical mold of a professional athlete. Not by a longshot. <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1184609/index.htm" target="_blank">In an extremely insightful article in Sports Illustrated</a> from 2011, Lee Jenkins paints a picture of the accidental NBA star. Andrew Bynum wasn&#8217;t supposed to play basketball for a living. He never really wanted to play. He never really had to play. He was invited to play. He agreed to play, to give it a shot, and he was wildly successful in a very short time. He is extremely gifted. But he never claimed or even gave the perception that this is what he wanted to do with his life. It&#8217;s not his fault he&#8217;s 7 feet tall, has soft hands, possessed the footwork of a (slow, but graceful) ballerina, and absorbed new information like a sponge. But that was Andrew Bynum. The accidental NBA star.</p>
<p>In his article, Jenkins talks about Bynum&#8217;s passions. He played soccer and tennis as a kid. He was part of the chess club at 7 years old. He&#8217;s the kind of guy who builds his own computers. And his own custom cars. He is very bright. He is cerebral. He could have been an engineer. An engineer! He practiced Tai-Chi. He is not a typical jock. He doesn&#8217;t have jock DNA. He has mad scientist DNA.</p>
<p>For Andrew Bynum, the NBA was an experiment. It was fun. He cashed a ton of checks. He won some championships. He made an All-Star team. But he was never going to be an NBA lifer. He was drafted as a child. He never really chose the NBA. The NBA chose him. He acquiesced for a while. He even worked really hard to succeed in the NBA. But when Andrew Bynum grew up, I think he realized that the adult Andrew Bynum didn&#8217;t really want to be a basketball player.</p>
<p>People think he doesn&#8217;t care about basketball because he has poor work ethic. Untrue. He doesn&#8217;t care about basketball because he cares about other things more than he cares about basketball. And that is his right. He doesn&#8217;t owe society a long NBA career. Bynum is a renaissance man. Basketball was one thing for him. It was never everything.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the real point here. Sometimes people are blessed with great gifts. But blessing is not an obligation to act. If the NBA didn&#8217;t make Andrew Bynum happy or satisfied, why should he be forced to stay in the NBA and put his heart and soul into something that doesn&#8217;t satisfy him?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the real Andrew Bynum story. It doesn&#8217;t fit into a soundbite or boilerplate narrative. But there it is. Things other than the NBA interest him. That&#8217;s not a crime. In most circles that would be considered virtuous. I consider it virtuous. Let Bynum do what he wants to do. He doesn&#8217;t owe us a basketball career. He doesn&#8217;t even owe it to himself.</p>
<p>Sometimes we find ourselves in situations where we can thrive if we choose to apply ourselves. Sometimes we would even thrive with minimal effort. But if our heart is not in it, sometimes it&#8217;s better to look elsewhere. Life is short. Find what you love and do that. Find what gives you pride and satisfaction and do that. Don&#8217;t just do what everyone else thinks you should do because it looks right to them. In 2014, we all have options. The world is flat and ready for us to explore. Find your passions and live them. Even if you were given something incredible at 17, we are not obligated to rechoose what we chose at that time. Reevaluate. Think. Discuss. Grow. And if you stay on the same path and along the same trajectory, do it because you&#8217;ve chosen it again, not because it was chosen all those years ago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/M21554875.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6400" title="M21554875" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/M21554875.jpg?resize=300%2C181" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The NBA season kicked off last night. The league is 83% non-white player. That makes for an average of 2.55 white players per NBA team (15 player rosters).</p>
<p>So it is definitely notable when a team has more than 3 white players and it is extremely unusual for a team to have 10 white players out of its 15 total players. It might be unusual, but that is this year&#8217;s Minnesota Timberwolves. They are the whitest team in NBA recent memory.</p>
<p>This has created some problems for the team.</p>
<p>A civil rights leader has accused the team of signing white players to appeal to the dominantly white Minneapolis &#8211; St. Paul community. He thinks it is a ploy to get white fans to buy more tickets to see the games.<span id="more-6399"></span></p>
<p>The team owner vehemently denies any such intent.</p>
<p>Not to mention that this tactic makes no sense. To make that assertion, one must assume that the white players are inferior and were chosen not for talent, but were chosen for their skin color despite their lack of talent. To assume that people are so racist that they will buy tickets to watch white players who are inferior to black players is quite an accusation. It means that not only are they racists, but they are idiots. It&#8217;s 2012. Americans want their teams to win more than they want them to look like they do. I&#8217;m very unimpressed with this civil rights activist&#8217;s claim.</p>
<p>The only real problem the team has experienced with so many white players is the choice of music in the locker room according to their lone black starting player, Brandon Roy.</p>
<p>But the latent issues that this accusation raises are worth addressing.</p>
<p>First of all, there are words used by fans and the media to describe players that vary depending on the player&#8217;s ethnicity. Black players are called athletic. White players are called smart. This is not meant to be insulting or racial. It just happens.</p>
<p>Second of all, the question of whether there is a subtle racism when assuming that white players are inferior to black players. While it may be true that more black players are better at basketball than white players, it seems to me that making assumptions based on race or color could be seen as insensitive. On the other hand, is playing probabilities and making snap judgments based on well established norms, racism?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s a two way street. If another person feels like a comment being made towards them is racist, I don&#8217;t think the intent really matters. There is certainly merit and value to avoiding words and phrases that others find offensive. This applies whether it is reasonable or not for that person to be offended.</p>
<p>Then again, the street does go the other direction as well. It would be wonderful if we were all a little less sensitive. While it is understandable that some people are very touchy, especially when it comes to race, it would be wise for us all to raise our standard of what offends us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/good-job-blue-ribbon.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5680" title="good-job-blue-ribbon" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/good-job-blue-ribbon.png?resize=217%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>After the Celtics defeated the Heat in Game 5 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals in what will surely be remembered as a disastrous game for LeBron, Wade, and company something managed to distract the public from the actual game. As Shane Battier and Ronny Turiaf exited the court through the tunnel the very loud, high pitched voice of a child pierced through the depressing noise of the arena.</p>
<p>While millions of people were watching the dejected Heat hang their heads in shame, one young fan&#8217;s voice pierced through the airwaves with an inspirational message. &#8220;Good job!&#8221; Good effort!&#8221; he cried. His team had just suffered a horrible loss, he must have been in pain, but he rose above it all to give his favorite players a bit of hope and positive reinforcement as they left the court.<span id="more-5678"></span></p>
<p>The young man&#8217;s name is Jack Meyer and he 9 years old. He has been a fan of the Heat since he was 3 or 4 years old and he must have been really upset after that loss. But he probably plays sports in a league and when his team loses or is getting outplayed his coaches probably shout out the same refrain. &#8220;Good job! Good effort!&#8221; I bet it lifts his spirits when he hears it and he just wanted to share the same inspiration to his favorite athletes.</p>
<p>The story is touching and absolutely adorable. You have to admire this kid&#8217;s positivity and his good job and good effort in inspiring his team.</p>
<p>Postivity is so important. We can accomplish so much when we feel good and when we feel like we are doing well. To be sure, pain and suffering can be excellent sources of inspiration as well. Perhaps necessity and anguish are even more effective motivators. But for the majority of us whose lives are not overloaded with pain and suffering, positive reinforcement is a great motivator and a great way to keep us from falling into melancholy or apathy.</p>
<p>But the truth is that sometimes a good job or a good effort is simply not enough. It could be argued that the Heat did not do a good a job and did not give their best effort. But let&#8217;s grant them a good effort and a good job for a moment. They still lost the game! And the game matters. Their job was to win. Their job was to give effort and do a good job but more than that, their goal was to win.</p>
<p>In life, effort matters. But results matter more. Effort matters. But achieving your goals matters more.</p>
<p>I am not trying to be a Grinch. I have a point. I think that we all have passions and responsibilities in our lives. And sometimes we neglect them. But we pat ourselves on the back and say &#8220;Good job! Good Effort! and think that is enough. It&#8217;s a start. But it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>If we want to learn more Torah, give more charity, spend more time with our spouses and children, do more acts of lovingkindness, make a difference in our communities, we can&#8217;t be satisfied with good effort. We need to demand from ourselves action and results. We all want to do more than we are doing. We can each apply this to various areas of our lives.</p>
<p>Much of the talk on the Internet is effort and sometimes it&#8217;s a good job. But if we don&#8217;t actually accomplish anything, we are not maximizing our opportunities. So many great ideas and conversations happen on the blogs and Facebook and Twitter (notice I left out Google Plus&#8230;), we need to somehow channel all of that into actual change.</p>
<p>It can be done. It must be done. Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<p>Your inspiration:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Discussion-NBA-Lockout.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4856" title="Discussion-NBA-Lockout" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Discussion-NBA-Lockout.jpg?resize=300%2C224" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Sports fans know that the NBA is currently undergoing a labor dispute between Ownership and the players represented by their Union. The dispute has led to two drastic measures.</p>
<p>First, the owners &#8220;locked out&#8221; the players. This means that the owners of the teams told the players that they would not allow them to play or earn paychecks unless they negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement. They tried negotiating. No deal was struck.</p>
<p>Next the players decertified their union. They are now individuals negotiating and no longer a union and they are suing the owners for anti-trust violations.</p>
<p>There are several very interesting things to note about these negotiations that would interest non-sports fans. This post deals with one.</p>
<p>Normally, unions are supported by liberals and ownership is supported by conservatives. I don&#8217;t need to explain this is too much detail it is fairly self-evident.</p>
<p>So knee-jerk reactionists, I know one particularly bombastic fellow in particular, will define their allegiances in this dispute based on their social / political beliefs. So knee-jerk conservatives will side with the owners and liberals will side with the players.</p>
<p>This is a mistake.<span id="more-4855"></span></p>
<p>The NBA is not like any other business for several reasons. What is relevant here is that the owners are not the same as any other group of ownership. In the NBA the owners have already imposed a team wide salary cap and maximum contracts as well as highly regulated contracts over the course of the first five years of every single player&#8217;s career.</p>
<p>This means that the best, most valuable players are unable to earn their actual value. Let&#8217;s take Kobe Bryant. Kobe is slated to earn $25,244,000 this year. That sounds like a lot of money and it is. But he is actually worth MORE than that. So the owners have regulated the salaries to the point that Kobe CANNOT earn market value for his services. It would be like the banking industry saying that a CFO can only make $5 million dollars a year even if he brings $35 million of revenue each year. This is not something conservatives should support.</p>
<p>Further, at this point in the negotiations, the players are fighting for issues regarding movement of players. Owners want the salary cap to be so draconian that a team would not be able sign players that really want to play for them. The owners want to keep players in the places where they drafter for longer. The players will have little to no say as to where they work. This is not very free market like either. Again, not something that conservatives should support.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is that small market owners are unhappy that they are not making money. There are many reasons a team might not be making money. But the single biggest expense for most teams is the salaries of their players. Teams with less income cannot afford to overspend on players. Yet, this is exactly what they do. A small market team gave Rashard Lewis, a two time NBA All Star who is a typical second or third best player on a team, $22,152,000 for this coming season. That is the second highest NBA salary. It is a terrible contract. Is it any wonder that the team that made that deal is losing money. Irresponsible spending is a huge factor in the bottom line of NBA teams. Whose fault is it if that team does not make money? The players? No. It is the owner&#8217;s. There are many many bad contracts in the NBA. Dumb owners are demanding a bailout and future safety net. Regulating contracts to the degree that it is impossible for an owner to make a mistake is not Capitalism. This is not something a conservative should support.</p>
<p>It turns out that in these negotiations, the union is arguing for conservative economic principles and the owners are arguing for more socialist principles. Conservatives should support the players. As hard as it may be to say the words &#8220;I support a union&#8221; or &#8220;I support labor&#8221; in this instance, the union and labor are the side that is more aligned with conservative beliefs.</p>
<p><em>(I believe that liberals should also support the players but that is not the point of this post.)</em></p>

True empathy can be seen on one&#8217;s face. Pain, sadness, suffering, happiness, love and confidence are emotions that are worn on one&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>If you think about it, it&#8217;s kind of a strange thing. Our emotions are in our brain. There are chemical reactions that determine the way our brains tell us we feel. Somehow those feelings translate into a universal language of facial expressions. Even if I cannot communicate via words with another, we can read each other&#8217;s facial expressions and at least have a general idea of how we are feeling.</p>
<p>There is a beautiful insight into this phenomena demonstrated by analyzing the hebrew word for face.<span id="more-4355"></span> The word used for face in the Torah is פנים (pronounced pah-neem). This word shares a root with the word בפנים (pronounced beef-neem). This word means &#8220;inside&#8221;. It is not a coincidence that these words share the same letters. The face gives clues as to what the person is feeling and thinking &#8220;inside&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is something that the video game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J5UQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217153&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B002I0J5UQ">L.A. Noire</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002I0J5UQ&amp;camp=217153&amp;creative=399349" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> tried to bring to its game. The game featured real facial expressions that reflect the thoughts and feelings of the actor. It was revolutionary and I might say, fairly succesful. The characters in the game seem more human and more emotive than any character in any other video game ever created. (See a demonstration here: <a href="http://kotaku.com/5802203/14-minutes-of-la-noires-unexpected-thrills" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>.)</p>
<p>The Atlantic has a fascinating slide show depicting LeBron James&#8217;s facial expressions during the NBA Finals. It is interesting because the criticism of LeBron&#8217;s performance in the Finals is about his heart, his determination, his confidence. These things can be measured on a person&#8217;s face.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/r.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3640" title="r" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/r-300x212.jpg?resize=300%2C212" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Last night, the Lakers pounded the Cleveland Cavaliers in historic fashion. The final score was 112-57. If the Lakers had one more basket they would have doubled up the Cavs. That&#8217;s just crazy.</p>
<p>One ex-Cavalier was enjoying the carnage. That would be one LeBron James. See, LeBron is supposedly very happy in his new Miami Heat jersey playing for a championship caliber team in South Beach. After all, it was his &#8220;decision&#8221; to go to Miami. But happy people don&#8217;t gratuitously &#8220;hate&#8221; on others.</p>
<p>Maybe LeBron isn&#8217;t so happy after all&#8230;</p>
<p>After the game, on his self titled, slightly narcissistic Twitter page called KingJames, LeBron tweeted this:<span id="more-3635"></span></p>
[blackbirdpie url=&#8221;http://twitter.com/#!/KingJames/status/25061817583673344&#8243;]
<p>Now that&#8217;s a real mean spirited thing to say. Isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Happy people don&#8217;t usually speak that way. Role models certainly do not&#8230;</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not here to tell you LeBron is a bad role model. I am here to say that, to use a metaphor, LeBron has mixed his metaphors.</p>
<p>Karma is a concept found in Eastern Religions. Most versions of Karma, of which I am aware, subscribe a natural order to the world. When that order is disrupted there is an automatic reaction to that disruption. So, if A harms B, a disruption is formed. Then, A may end of being harmed, but it was his own fault because his harm was a result of the disruption he caused when he harmed B.</p>
<p>God plays no role in Karma. It is a natural reaction.</p>
<p>LeBron is confusing Karma with Divine Retribution. Oops!</p>
<p>Worse still is the hubris in the assumption that whatever happens to the Cavs is because of their fans&#8217; hatred of LeBron. They were scorned. Their hatred is not completely unwarranted. I am not sure why there would be any Divine Retribution for disliking LeBron.</p>
<p>One also has to wonder what LeBron thinks happened when his teams were summarliy eliminated from the playoffs the last few years. Was that Divine Retribution as well?</p>
<p>It seems to me that many athletes selectively blame and attribute God when it suits them. LeBron is thrilled that the Cavs lost last night so he thinks it was God. But when he loses I&#8217;m sure he doesn&#8217;t think that he lost due to some terrible things he did, of which there are plenty of documented episodes. It&#8217;s moronic to think that it is God deciding the games, but only when it suits you.</p>
<p>LeBron made three errors in that tweet. 1) It was nasty and mean spirited 2) He confused Karma and Divine Retribution and 3) He selectively attributed one event to Divine Retribution.</p>
<p>LeBron James: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/02/athletes-as-role-models/" target="_blank">Still not a role model</a>&#8230;</p>

<p>When asked about the Arizona Immigration Law &#8211; state Senate Bill 1070, by ESPN.com columnist J.A. Adande, Jackson raised a few eyebrow. In fact he raised enough eyebrows that a protest is planned for tonight&#8217;s game at Staples Center in Downtown LA.</p>
<p>The LA Times has a full report here: <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/05/activists-protest-lakers-coach-phil-jackons-comments-on-arizonas-new-immigration-law.html">Activists protest Lakers Coach Phil Jackson&#8217;s comments on Arizona&#8217;s new immigration law</a></p>
<p>What did Jackson say that set off the protesters?<span id="more-2475"></span></p>
<p>During their Playoffs Series against the San Antonio Spurs, the Suns wore Jerseys that paid tribute to the Latino community by tweaking the name of the team from Suns to Los Suns. That this is somehow a strong political statement is a stretch in my mind. Some people (including the players) felt that by wearing Los Suns on their jersey it was somehow a protest against the law. I don&#8217;t see it that way.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Adande asked Jackson what he thought about the Suns political statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>First Jackson, who has showed lefty leanings in the past, indicated he had no problem with the controversial state Senate Bill 1070.</p>
<p><em>“Am I crazy, or am I the only one that heard [the legislature] say ‘we just took the United States immigration law and adapted it to our state,’”</em> Jackson said.</p>
<p>I told him they usurped the federal law.</p>
<p><em>“It’s not usurping, it’s just copying it is what they said they did, and then they gave it some teeth to be able to enforce it,”</em> Jackson said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I feel exactly like Jackson. Am I crazy?</p>
<p>When the bill was passed the NY Times had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Arizona is the first state to demand that immigrants meet <strong>federal requirements</strong> to carry identity documents legitimizing their presence on American soil. (Full article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html" target="_blank">here</a>.) (emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p>The law just enforces a Federal Requirement. Uncle Righteous (that&#8217;s Coach Jackson&#8217;s other nickname) is just standing up for Uncle Sam.</p>
<p>So Jackson is right. Yet the law has set off a firestorm. Why? I can think of a lot of reasons. But it seems misguided to take out your anger on Phil Jackson, or even the state of Arizona! This a Federal Regulation!</p>
<p>Anyway, I digress. There are two things I want to mention.</p>
<p>First, Adande makes a foolish assumption. He assumes that if a man is a Democrat or a liberal then he falls in line and supports every single policy of fellow Democrats. The money quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>That was surprising to hear coming from a man who not only supported Bill Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination, he wore a Bradley campaign pin on his suit during games.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is it surprising? Each issue has its merits and demerits. Why must we be pigeonholed once we hold one way in one issue that now in every other issue our opinion is pre-determined!? This bothers me a lot. Jackson has every right to feel one way on one issue and side with &#8220;liberals&#8221;  and on other issues side with &#8220;conservatives&#8221;. If not, we cease to think and become party line robots.</p>
<p>Finally, sports and politics don&#8217;t mix. To me that means that an athlete or sportswriter or coach can have an opinion but it is not nearly as valuable as their relative expertise on sports. Is Jackson influential in political spheres? Absolutely not. So why protest his statements? Let the guy coach basketball and ignore everything else that he says.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I do&#8230;</p>

That is until he reminds us that it is all about the money in the off-season, because LeBron is a free agent this summer.</p>
<p>I have had my criticisms of LeBron in the past. <span id="more-2377"></span>In <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/02/athletes-as-role-models/">Athletes as Role Models?</a> I reminded everyone that athletes are just athletes. They are not people worth looking up to. And in <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/09/21/teamwork-important-in-sports-more-important-in-life/">Teamwork: Important in Sports, More Important in Life</a> I pointed out that for an athlete who is supposed to be such a team player, the video of LeBron with his teammates disappearing is a conflicting (and wrong) message.</p>
<p>The latest gripe I have with LeBron is even more serious. LeBron owns a marketing company call LRMR. In the NBA a marketing company is a conglomorate that tries to woo potential clients from the college ranks to sign with them to represent the athlete&#8217;s interest. The agency will market the player as a commodity to teams to negotiate salary as well to corporations to contract endorsement deals.</p>
<p>The business is shady enough as it is. College athletes are not allowed to accept payment or gifts. Marketing agencies will use 3rd parties to win over athletes in the hope that the 3rd party will control which agency the athlete chooses. Is it legal? probably. Nevertheless, it is definitiely shady. But when an athlete, especially an athlete with the influence of LeBron enters the fray, what was shady is now borderline unethical. If an athlete controls other athlete&#8217;s decisions by controlling their contract negotionations and endorsement deals, that is a level of control that is, in my view, wrong.</p>
<p>But maybe LeBron is such a sterling character that he would never dream of using his influence to contol athletes?</p>
<p>Sorry, but <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=aw-lebronwall041310" target="_blank">according to this Yahoo News item</a>, LeBron is already working his magic on the most highyl touted NBA prospect since LeBron, John Wall.</p>
<p>Just another reason I don&#8217;t like LeBron&#8230;</p>

<p>A few days ago a photo was posted on <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">Twitter</a> by the <a href="http://twitter.com/NBA" target="_blank">NBA</a>. Somehow, this photo has been on my mind since I saw it.</p>
<p>In sports, two teams oppose each other under the pretense that they are enemies. Their fans may even dislike one another, (see Celtics / Lakers, Yankees / Red Sox, UNC / Duke, etc,) but in the end, athletes are mostly friendly with each other. Even when athletes get upset or physical with one another, they can remain friends (see Kobe Bryant and Ron Artest).</p>
<p>In the real world, people have a harder time getting along. People divide along political lines, religious lines and country lines.<span id="more-1740"></span></p>
<p>The natural state of people is almost to be at odds with one another. Peace is not just the lack of war. Peace is the active interrelation of two entities in harmonious activity. The opposite of peace is not war, it is merely lack of working together. It is pretty easy for two entities to ignore each other, but that is not peace. Peace is working together. Yet, peace remains so elusive on a grand scale and an individual scale.</p>
<p>This is something that is really hard for me. I honestly (perhaps naively) believe that almost all friction and disagreement is a result of misunderstanding and miscommunication. At our core, we know how to get along but the reality of society and our environment confuses us into discord. Maybe I am wrong, but this what I believe.</p>
<p>That is why seeing this photo was so stirring. It was a photo that showed that when the context changes, when our environment is different, peace is so easy. Sports provides the context for enemies to befriend one another.</p>
<p>Are there two greater enemies in the world today than Israel and Iran?</p>
<p>And yet, below you will see a photo of the best Israeli basketball player, who is now playing for the Sacramento Kings, Omri Casspi and the best Iranian basketball player, playing for the Memphis Grizzlies, Hamed Haddadi. They look like the best of friends. Yet, in their home countries people are dying for their causes in defiance of the opposing cause&#8230;</p>
<p>It is my fervent wish and prayer that we can find peace. Not just peace between nations with differences, but personal peace within ourselves and within our relationships and communities.</p>
<p>Just think of this photo the next time you are about to pass judgment or prolong a disagreement. We can all get along, we can all be a part of peace, we can all unite under the banner of the human race and be tolerant of whoever we encounter.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/CASSPI-HADDADI.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5495" title="CASSPI-HADDADI" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/CASSPI-HADDADI.jpg?resize=560%2C823" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Tolerance. Love. Peace.</p>
<p>Please.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1225" title="unity" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/unity.jpg?resize=180%2C180" alt="unity" data-recalc-dims="1" />Rosh Hashana at <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a> was wonderful. The services were inspiring, the attendance was excellent and the mood properly reflected the importance of the days.</p>
<p>I spoke from the pulpit several times over the holiday.</p>
<p>There was certainly an over-arching theme to my sermons. Each had its own individual message but overall they reflected an idea that I feel is central to Rosh Hashana, judgment, repentance, Judaism and Humanity.</p>
<p>It is too easy to get  caught up in ourselves. We hope for a good verdict, we try to be the best people we can be as individuals.</p>
<p>For me, the greater challenge is fitting in the group. Every time I spoke over the Holiday, the underlying theme was Unity.<span id="more-1224"></span>Each person really has three identities.</p>
<p>One is our own personal accomplishments. Everything that one does in their life goes into this category and those things have value on their own. We look at the person in a vacuum and assess their achievements as an individual. Everyone has unique talents and abilities that make then who they are.</p>
<p>The second identity is the person&#8217;s group. Everyone is part of various groups. Whether by religion, race, political party, trade or family we all belong to groups. Those groups form a part of our identity. But each group member&#8217;s individual role is not relevant. The group has an identity and by association with that group, that identity becomes the identity of everyone in the group.</p>
<p>The third identity is the most important. It is the combination of number 1 and number 2. It is how we interact with the group using our individual talents and abilities. This identity is the meeting point of the indidual and the group. If the individual is selfish and uses their talents and abilities for their own personal gain and ignores the group, the person has failed in this identity. But if the person is able to part if the group and use their individualism to elevate the group, then in turn, they elevate themselves.</p>
<p>No where is this third identity clearer to the observer than in competitive team sports. The individual performer has his or her own talents and abilities. What separates the great ones from the rest, is their ability  to use those skills and elevate the team.</p>
<p>It is no different in real life. We all have skills and we are all part of groups. We need to use those skills to elevate our groups, not just ourselves.</p>
<p>It was particularly appropriate to find a <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/6975/more-than-a-game-preview" target="_blank">short post on the NBA Truehoop Blog about this issue today</a>.</p>
<p>LeBron James has a new movie. It is supposed to be about teamwork, but as Truehoop so eloquently puts it, the preview completely fails in this regard.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>The bummer about it, however, is that the movie is all about teamwork, but the undeniable message of the preview&#8217;s format (James, shooting alone in a gym) is that celebrity trumps all.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Watch the preview below and you will see just what they mean.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="325" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RlEi1iYCukQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="325" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RlEi1iYCukQ&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Good imagery for the wrong message. We need to be team players in sports and more importantly in life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, the red-headed step child of the NBA is going to the Lakers.</p>
<p>There are folks who will be up in arms over a known &#8220;thug&#8221; joining their beloved Lakers.</p>
<p>The same Ron Artest who was suspended for one full year from participating in NBA games for his egregious actions when he was a young up and coming star with the Pacers.</p>
<p>As a Parent and as Rabbi you may want to know: What do I think?</p>
<p>If you <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/02/athletes-as-role-models/" target="_blank">read my blog</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/29/obligatory-michael-jackson-post/" target="_blank">you should know</a> what I think.<span id="more-823"></span></p>
<p>To me, an athlete is judged on one thing and one thing only, their athletic ability.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1998/weekly/980504/insidelook.html" target="_blank">how many illegitimate children they have</a>. I don&#8217;t care if they are nice people. I don&#8217;t care if they have good sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Those are the values that are my responsibility to teach my children. In fact, my son of 6 already knows that Artest is a thug. He also knows that kind of behavior is unacceptable. He also knows Artest is a great ball player and that has no impact on his character.</p>
<p>Now, if Artest&#8217;s behavior affects the performance of my team, then I start to care. But if he is a great teammate and contributes to the team, he is a good Laker.</p>
<p>Parents, DON&#8217;T LET YOUR CHILDREN IDOLIZE ATHLETES, THEY WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/03/11/does-jeff-mcgregor-learn-messilas-yesharim/" target="_blank">A few months back I hinted at a future post</a> about athletes and their role in our society as role models.</p>
<p>This past weekend I was reminded about my feelings on the subject. What I feel is what I believe to be the Torah approach but is of consequence and significance to anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>Over the weekend the NBA Conference Finals were settled. Something that happened after one team was eliminated has caused a media frenzy.<span id="more-735"></span></p>
<p>First, the Los Angeles Lakers advanced to the NBA finals for the 30th time in 61 years. (yay!) That is serious excellence right there. For the non-fans this means that during the games you will be able to drive the speed limit on the 405 because everyone else will be inside watching the game.</p>
<p>Then on Saturday night the impossible happened. LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers were eliminated by the Orlando Magic. Why is this the impossible? LeBron is a &#8220;godlike&#8221; figure and was expected to &#8220;redeem&#8221; his team and city by bringing them to the &#8220;promised land&#8221;. I am not kidding. Sportscenter on ESPN had a segment where a Minister from Cleveland said that Clevelanders were beginning to worship &#8220;The King&#8221;. LeBron is the most celebrated human being on the planet and is idolized around the world.</p>
<p>Anyway, the poor guy loses in 6 games to the Magic.</p>
<p>Ironically, this gives ABC Broadcasting which is owned by Disney a Walt Disney World (Orlando) vs. Disneyland (LA) Championship. Talk about jackpot!</p>
<p>The custom in all sports is for the losing team to shake the hands of the winning team and congratulate them upon winning. In fact according to Websters, this is the very definition of &#8220;Sportsmanship&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span>conduct (as fairness, respect for one&#8217;s opponent, and graciousness in winning or losing) becoming to one participating in a sport.</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The word has been around since <em>1745</em> and is preached universally to all athletes and competitors.</p>
<p>LeBron was so upset about losing to the Magic that <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/news/story?id=4218722" target="_blank">he left the court in a hurry</a> and did not congratulate the winning team. This is a big no-no.</p>
<p>In fact, he was so upset<em> </em>by the loss he also skipped out on the mandatory press conference.</p>
<p>That is bad sportsmanship. No question about it.</p>
<p>Do I care?</p>
<p><em>Absolutely not.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect better from an athlete. His excellence in Basketball has no bearing on his excellence in social skills, personal growth, intelligence, happiness or even sportsmanship. The only thing that he does that commands respect is his ball playing prowess. That is the only thing I look up to in this person.</p>
<p>Is he sending a bad message?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t turn to LeBron for messages on Sportsmanship. Nor do I turn to any athlete or celebrity for anything other than waht makes them unique or special.</p>
<p>As a parent it is my job to provide good role models for my children. I may need to be that role model at times. At other times it will teachers, Rabbis, family members or other people who command respect for their area of specialty. Athletes are not role models. Allowing an athlete to be the role model for your child is a failure in  your parenting.</p>
<p>Athletes may by chance turn out to be wonderful people whom we may respect for their abilities beyond sports, and that is great but it is not the norm. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/01/kobe-and-zehirus/" target="_blank">I myself have commented</a> on some athletes ability to prepare for their games and we can learn about preparation from them. However, expecting athletes to be role models is a terrible idea.</p>
<p>I think parents get lazy and expect their children to learn good values without taking the time or effort to teach those values. When the child gets nothing from his parents, athletes may fill that void. Ultimately they will all disappoint us.</p>
<p>Be a role model and don&#8217;t rely on superhuman athletes to do it for you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You thought I was done with <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/05/clothing-round-up/" target="_blank">clothes</a>?</p>
<p>Not at all. The NBA had huge image issue a few years back. The image issue resulted from a few<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vugHaNQPnBs&amp;feature=related" target="_blank"> on the court</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alGfuK1iGtE" target="_blank">incidents</a> along with the perception that<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_culture" target="_blank"> hip-hop culture</a> was a) <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/mar/27/20040327-095853-4500r/" target="_blank">dangerous</a> b) a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11188-2004Nov24.html" target="_blank">major part of the NBA</a> players lives&#8217;.</p>
<p>Commissioner David Stern sought to change the culture of the NBA as well as the public&#8217;s perception of the NBA. Stern enacted a dress code.<span id="more-347"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>1. General Policy: Business Casual</p>
<p>Players are required to wear Business Casual attire whenever they are engaged in team or league business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business Casual&#8221; attire means</p>
<p>•    A long or short-sleeved dress shirt (collared or turtleneck), and/or a sweater.<br />
•    Dress slacks, khaki pants, or dress jeans.<br />
•    Appropriate shoes and socks, including dress shoes, dress boots, or other presentable shoes, but not including sneakers, sandals, flip-flops, or work boots.</p>
<p>2. Exceptions to Business Casual</p>
<p>There are the following exceptions to the general policy of Business Casual attire:</p>
<p>a. Players In Attendance At Games But Not In Uniform</p>
<p>•    Sport Coat<br />
•    Dress shoes or boots, and socks</p>
<p>b. Players Leaving the Arena</p>
<p>Players leaving the arena may wear either Business Casual attire or neat warm-up suits issued by their teams.</p>
<p>c. Special Events or Appearances</p>
<p>Teams can make exceptions to the Business Casual policy for special events or player appearances where other attire is appropriate &#8212; e.g., participation in a basketball clinic.</p>
<p>3. Excluded Items</p>
<p>The following is a list of items that players are not allowed to wear at any time while on team or league business:</p>
<p>•    Sleeveless shirts<br />
•    Shorts<br />
•    T-shirts, jerseys, or sports apparel (unless appropriate for the event (e.g., a basketball clinic), team-identified, and approved by the team)<br />
•    Headgear of any kind while a player is sitting on the bench or in the stands at a game, during media interviews, or during a team or league event or appearance (unless appropriate for the event or appearance, team-identified, and approved by the team)<br />
•    Chains, pendants, or medallions worn over the player&#8217;s clothes<br />
•    Sunglasses while indoors<br />
•    Headphones (other than on the team bus or plane, or in the team locker room)</p></blockquote>
<p>This was met with serious opposition. Players <a href="http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/9730334/" target="_blank">claimed the dress code was racist.</a> <a href="http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2005/10/26/Sports/Nba-Dress.Code.Shows.Stern.Out.Of.Touch-1034316.shtml" target="_blank">Others</a> just thought David Stern was &#8220;out of touch&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well, vindication is sweet. ESPN columnist <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3898919" target="_blank">Ric Bucher writes</a> the that effects of the dress code have carried over into the personal lives of the NBA players. Not only do players <em>look</em> more professional, they also <em>act</em> more professional. This has influenced the cars they drive, the food they eat and the way they dress even not while under the watchful eye of the NBA. I recommend reading all linked articles &#8211; especially this one!</p>
<p>Of course we would <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/03/the-clothes-make-or-break-the-man-connections-2209/" target="_blank">expect nothing else</a>. When one is dressed professionally they are more likely to act professionally. The clothing influences our attitudes and our feelings. The NBA is another clear example of this phenomenon.</p>
