				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.559378" target="_blank">The purists insist</a> that Chanukah is a holiday that celebrates a victory against assimilation. They find this ironic because Chanukah is celebrated by so many assimilated Jews who don’t even realize that they are celebrating a holiday about winning a war against their spiritual ancestors. <a href="http://haaretz.com/jewish-world/rabbis-round-table/.premium-1.560152" target="_blank">In Haaretz I argued</a> that this is irrelevant and new meanings to holidays can be perfectly acceptable in Orthodox Judaism and it’s wrong to begrudge our fellows Jews an opportunity to participate in a holiday.</p>
<p>After a bit more thought, I am not so sure that the victory was in fact against assimilation and assimilators per se. The true purpose of the war was to liberate the Temple and re-establish autonomy so that the Jewish people could practice their God-given religion unfettered.<span id="more-7903"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1298383772_11-e1385626617988.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7904" alt="1298383772_11" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/1298383772_11-e1385626617988-600x475.jpg" /></a>The Syrian-Greek occupiers made laws that prevented Jewish people from following the word of God. Many people willingly gave up their Judaism and integrated into the foreign culture. These people completely assimilated our of fear.</p>
<p>The Maccabees and their followers were religious zealots who knew that if the Syrian-Greeks were not pushed out of the land, Judaism would have been lost. The lives of those who were living by the Torah were at risk. Whoever disobeyed the prohibitions against Judaism was to be killed. At one point, the Maccabees were threatened with death. It was then that Matisyahu was filled with the passion to wage a war for the sake of their religious beliefs. They took upon themselves the responsibility to evict the Syrian-Greeks from the Temple and to restore their religious freedom.</p>
<p>That is what the war was about. It’s true that when the Maccabees conquered areas within the Land of Israel they would return the citizens of each city and town to observance, however that does not mean that the actual war was for the purpose of un-assimilating the assimilated. It was a collateral benefit for sure, but it was not the objective. The objectives were autonomy, religious freedom, and the Temple.</p>
<p>The war was won when those three objectives were secured. The Book of Maccabees tells us very little about the Hellenized Jews living in the Land of Israel after the Maccabees had vanquished the Syrian-Greeks. Apparently, it was not an important fact to report. The battles were important. Winning the war was important.</p>
<p>So when we look at Chanukah through this lens, I am no longer convinced that the war was a civil war between Traditional and Hellenized Jews as it has been presented. It was a battle for the right to practice as Traditional Jews. The Hellenized Jews were apathetic to the goals of the Maccabee, and the Maccabees did what they could to restore the glory of Torah and Mitzvos to the Hellenists. But to make the entire story about defeating assimilation and assimilated Jews is not true to the story. Perhaps without a Meccabeean victory, total assimilation would have been inevitable, however there is no indication that anyone was pushing Traditional Jews to assimilate other than the Syrian-Greeks and other than through threat to life.</p>
<p>One can certainly argue that the meaning of the holiday should be informed by the staunch anti-assimilation stance the Maccabees took. It’s certainly possible. But is it the only interpretation of the story? Certainly not. Is it a tenet of our faith or a necessary component to the celebration of the holiday to hold that the war was not really a physical struggle, but a spiritual struggle and the real enemy was not the Syrian-Greeks, rather it was the Hellenists? Hardly. Is it still ironic if secular or marginally religious Jews celebrate Chanukah? I don’t think so.<br />
The holiday celebrates the restoration of the incredible opportunity to serve God as we were commanded. It was not merely a celebration of staving off assimilation. It was much more than that and focusing on assimilation detracts from the more prominent aspects of the story. And so, I think that if assimilated Jews are celebrating their sort of Chanukah despite their assimilation, they are more like the Maccabees than the Hellenized Jews. They are not allowing themselves to completely disappear. They are not identifying with the Syrian-Greeks who lost the war, nor the Hellenists who played at most a secondary role during the Chanukah story. Indeed, they identify with the Maccabees by celebrating a Jewish religious holiday while steeped in a very seductive American culture. There is nothing ironic or foolish about that. Nothing at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/rabbis-round-table/.premium-1.560152" target="_blank">This article was originally published on Haaretz.com</a>. It is reproduced with their permission here:</em></p>
<p><em></em>Hanukkah has become an iconic holiday. In many ways, it has become as well known and popular as Christmas. But what exactly is its message?</p>
<p>The origins of Hanukkah are mired in obscurity. The rabbis of the Talmud established the days of Hanukkah as a commemoration for a small jug of oil that burned for eight days instead of burning for one day, as expected. Religious zeal and fervor were the themes of the first Hanukkah. For much of Jewish history, and for much of Orthodox Judaism today, the holiday retains much of its Talmudic meaning. Hanukkah is like a wink from a hidden God reminding us that when we stand up for our Judaism, God is standing with us.<span id="more-7914"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/185367.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7915" alt="185367" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/185367.jpg" /></a>This is not a very pluralistic message. It’s also not the way that most people look at Hanukkah today. Many people see that holiday as a celebration of religious freedom. Others see it as a beautiful way of competing with more popular holidays like Christmas. Yet others consider the military struggle for autonomy the central focus of the day.</p>
<p>Purists might <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-1.559378" target="_blank">recoil at the thought</a> that the Talmudic intent behind the holiday is being ignored or even changed.  I don’t think this is a valid concern.</p>
<p>Jewish holidays have multiple layers of meaning, often depending on time and place. During the First Temple period the holiday of Sukkot was a harvest holiday. Most Jewish people don’t celebrate the harvest aspect of the holiday anymore. Passover has meant different things to different people as well. It started as a commemoration of the exodus from Egypt. For many people throughout the long exile it has come to symbolize our yearning to return to the Land of Israel and a Messianic utopia.</p>
<p>Even within the somewhat narrow confines of Orthodox Judaism, Hasidut added new elements and meaning to our holidays. We have a longstanding tradition of reinterpreting Jewish holidays.</p>
<p>There may be no starker historical example of this reinterpretation than Hanukkah itself. Maccabees I and Maccabees II provide their own reasons for the holiday. No miracle of oil is found in these texts. Josephus also neglects to mention this miracle. These sources focus primarily on the military victory.</p>
<p>It is pretty clear that the rabbis of the Talmud sought to refocus the day from a military victory and its attendant zealotry in favor of the commemoration of a miracle of a small cruse of oil. The Talmud glosses over the military victory in its description of the holiday.</p>
<p><em>“What is Chanukkah? That [which] our Sages taught: On the 25th of Kislev &#8211; the days of Chanukkah, they are eight, not to eulogize on them and not to fast on them, for when the Greeks entered the Temple, they polluted all the oils in the Temple, and when the Hasmonean dynasty overcame and defeated them, they checked and they found but one cruse of oil that was set in place with the seal of the High Priest, but there was in only [enough] to light a single day. A miracle was done with it, and they lit from it for eight days. The following year [the Sages] fix those [days], making them holidays for praise and thanksgiving.”</em> (Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 21A, Translation from Sefaria.org)</p>
<p>In the Talmud, the military victory is presented merely as incidental to the miracle of the oil. There was no miraculous victory and winning the war was not worth celebrating on its own in their view. The rabbis of the Talmud may be said to have started the tradition of reinterpreting the Hanukkah story.</p>
<p>Medieval commentaries asked why Hanukkah is eight days if the miracle was only for seven days? There was enough oil for one day! One day was natural and seven days were miracles, so we should celebrate seven days of miracle. One commentary reinterprets the military victory as a miracle to answer this famous question. Another reinterpretation. This time in nearly direct opposition to the Talmud’s version.</p>
<p>Reinterpretation is all part of the Hanukkah story. As long as the message is consistent with the ideals of Judaism and serve to help maintain a connection to the essence of the holiday, we should embrace new ideas. Orthodox Jews may insist that the laws of rabbinic Judaism are incontrovertible, and in our view they are, but the message and meaning of our holidays have long been much more fluid. If today’s Hanukkah message can be transformed to a more unifying and inspirational day for more Jews, so be it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><div id="attachment_5068" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/operation-solomon-1.jpeg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5068" title="operation-solomon-1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/operation-solomon-1-300x198.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="198" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ethiopian Jews Arriving in Israel During Operation Solomon</p></div>
<p>One of my favorite things about visiting Israel is the diversity of Jewish people, practices and customs. In particular, the Kotel is a special place for so many Jewish people and even non-Jewish people. I always marvel at the beauty of the stones and all the people there to soak in their glory.</p>
<p>The only shul that I know of that rivals the Kotel in diversity is the <a href="pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Shul on the Beach</a> where I am the rabbi. It really is remarkable. It is not quite the diversity of the Kotel, but Pacific Jewish Center is probably a slightly distant second.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some people who do not value diversity. Some people desire uniformity in action, thought and dress. The latest victim of this attitude was chronicled in a recent AP article.</p>
<p>The Israeli rabbinate has proclaimed that the Ethiopian Jewish community religious leaders, called kessoch, no longer be recognized by the State of Israel. The control over who is recognized as a legitimate spiritual leader in Israel is in the hands of the Rabbinate.<span id="more-5067"></span></p>
<p>At this point, most, if not all of the kessoch have abandoned their traditional dress and now conform to the standard of Ashkenazik rabbis who wear dark suits, white shirts and black hats. Traditionally, the kessoch worse turbans and clothing that is appropriate for a community with roots in North Africa.</p>
<p>Some of their customs were already abandoned when they emigrated to Israel. These were customs that varied greatly from the practiced version of orthodox Judaism in Israel. But now, they are being forced to completely assimilate into the dominant version of Judaism in Israel.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of whether or not the Ethiopian Jews are legitimate. The working assumption is that they have converted if necessary and are now full-fledged Jews. The issue is that once they are Jews, they are not being permitted to have official rabbis who hail from their communities. These communities were self regulated and ruled for hundreds and hundreds of years. Now, they are being forced to give that up.</p>
<p>I find it sad and ironic the Jews are forcing assimilation on other Jews.</p>
