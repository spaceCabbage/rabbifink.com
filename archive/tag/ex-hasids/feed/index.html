				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7202" alt="131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/131991_MG_1282_EscapingReligion_630-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>Every group or cause needs a spokesperson. There is no more eloquent a spokesperson for her cause than Leah Vincent. (No offense to the rest of her group intended.)</p>
<p>Leah represented herself and Footsteps quite nicely on Katie Couric&#8217;s show, creatively named Katie. Every story about someone leaving the ultra-orthodox community has the potential to be a huge chillul Hashem and an abject failure. My sense of the segment on Katie was that despite the significant obstacles placed before her, Leah has been very successful in her personal and professional life. The segment veered from a discussion about the flaws or problems in her community. In fact, it almost glossed over them.</p>
<p>If one was looking for a chillul Hashem, I think it would be hard to find one in this segment. It was much easier to see chillul Hashem in previous television appearances by those who left ultra-orthodox Judaism. I think it speaks to Leah&#8217;s dignity and demeanor that the segment was so respectful.<span id="more-7200"></span></p>
<p>Leah&#8217;s story is harrowing. She points to two traumatic incidents in the segment. One ended her childhood and the other ended her life. When her parents cut her off, Leah was forced to live on her own, work minimum wage jobs just to survive. It&#8217;s not clear what her level of observance was at the time, but I gather that she was still orthodox. Unfortunately, this kind of thing happens in our community. It&#8217;s being worked on and hopefully we will see less and less of this odd form of &#8220;tough love&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then she was raped. Leah was obviously trying to control her emotions when she talked about this second traumatic event. She pushed through it displaying great strength and courage. I do wonder what happened to her attacker. Nothing was mentioned about that.</p>
<p>I found it interesting how Leah still calls the world of her childhood &#8220;my sect&#8221;. She still identifies with the community. I guess that&#8217;s a good thing, but I also think it shows how hard it is to leave.</p>
<p>Here is what is a little different about Leah&#8217;s story. She is not from a chasidic background. She got a decent secular education and speaks English perfectly. Others who have left orthodox Judaism, leave with a rudimentary education at best, and a speech handicap that may appear to limit them. Also, being from the non-chasidic world, it is more likely that Leah encountered Jews who were not ultra-orthodox in her childhood. The level of insularity in her world is less than in the chasidic world.*</p>
<p>Which leads me to the real purpose behind the segment. I think the goal was to publicize the work of <a href="footstepsorg.org" target="_blank">Footsteps</a>. On the show, Footsteps was said to provide a safe place for those who left orthodox Judaism and especially ultra-orthodox Judaism. They tend to social and psychological needs as well as practical needs of those who left orthodoxy. People like Leah, who needed friendship and emotional support. Others need help getting GEDs or jobs or speaking English properly.</p>
<p>I think there are a lot of orthodox Jews who look at Footsteps as the enemy. They see them as the group that is making it easier to leave and as part of the problem. Or worse, they seem them as evangelizing those who are still in the community and influencing them to leave.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see it this way at all.</p>
<p>The people who need Footsteps are our brothers, sisters, cousins, children, and grandchildren. They are our family. Our system didn&#8217;t work for them. No system can work for everyone. Are we to leave them to die in the streets? If we have not prepared them for life on the outside, we are failing our duty to our own family members. If we do not provide them with warmth and support even after they leave, they must get that love and support somewhere. Footsteps is doing that work.</p>
<p>Of course, I would prefer to see our community provide these services. I would rather we all learn English and earn high school diplomas. I would love it if we could stay connected emotionally to those of us who leave. And we are working on all that. Hopefully we will get there soon. But in the meantime, Footsteps is doing <em>our </em>work by helping those in our community who leave. We must express our dismay that there is a need for Footsteps. We must also express our appreciation for Footsteps. They are doing our holy work of taking care of our children for us.</p>
<p>So long as Footsteps is not actively trying to draw people out of our community I think they should have our support. If they do attempt to subversively foster dissent and revolt, I can&#8217;t see how we can embrace their mission. Either way, we must thank them for taking care of our family members. So, thank you Footsteps.</p>
<p><em>*UPDATE: Leah&#8217;s background is non-conventional. She grew up in a non-insular community but her family tried to live an isolated life.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/conspiracy-theory-alert.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7112" alt="conspiracy-theory-alert" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/conspiracy-theory-alert-300x262.jpg" width="300" height="262" /></a>One would think that the Internet would be good for at least one thing. It should help debunk conspiracies. After all, all one needs to do is do a little Googling to find out if there are actual facts to support a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Compared with the pre-Internet dark ages, it would seem to be much easier to debunk conspiracies. But in fact the opposite is true. Conspiracies proliferate on the Internet. People find confirmation for their ideas on the Internet, no matter how crazy the ideas may be, and so the Internet provides more fuel to the fire of conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>The NY Times published an article trying to explain why rational people believe in conspiracies and what kind of people believe in conspiracies.</p>
<p>It seems that the primary factors of conspiracy theorists are cynicism about the world, cynicism about politics, low self-worth, and a feeling of powerlessness. In other words, believing in conspiracies may be a defense mechanism against these sorts of feelings. Correlation does not equal causation, obviously, but there is some reasoning behind this as well.</p>
<p>When people feel like they have little say in the world and they feel that the world is &#8220;out to get them&#8221; they can regain some semblance of control by claiming to have inside information and a broader understanding of what is happening in the world.<span id="more-7111"></span></p>
<p>Reacting to the news that a formerly chasidic woman lost custody of her children, many people see a conspiracy. They see a judge that is biased because she is bought by chasidic groups. Or they see a a judge who favors a religious home over a secular home. Or they see a judge who is afraid to stand up to a very powerful chasidic community. All of these things are possible. However, there are also legitimate reasons she lost custody.</p>
<p>Seeing things that may or may not be there to support an overarching narrative is conspiracy-like. It also fits in well with the typology of people who buy into a conspiracy. Many of the people buying into the conspiracy are ex-hasids who are cynical about the chasidic world (rightfully so!), may feel marginalized by that world (they are), and are certainly likely to feel powerless in that world. It&#8217;s empowering to have an overarching narrative to explain what happened.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that there is a conspiracy, but I don&#8217;t think it is supported by the facts that I read. I don&#8217;t begrudge anyone for trying to advocate on the mother&#8217;s behalf and I support those who do not want courts to include any religious considerations in custody proceedings. But I think there is a reason</p>
<p>I think this can also relate to people who buy into <em>segulos</em> and magical mystical mystery thinking. People who are cynical about the world because of anti-Semitism or theologically based xenophobia, who feel powerless because the world is &#8220;out to get them&#8221; or because there are dark forces that are making things difficult, are prime candidates to turn to solutions not based in reality. They will use &#8220;spiritual&#8221; cures for illness or everyday superstition or they turn to snake oil salesmen pitching salvation for the same reasons people believe in conspiracies. I think they are very similar.</p>
<p>In politics I think this bears out as well. <a href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2013/05/oklahoma-tornado-conspiracy-theories/65499/" target="_blank">People who think President Obama made the tornado</a> with a fancy weather maker to distract from current political scandals match some of these factors. They think Obama is out to get them. They think that they are doomed. They think they are powerless to stop Obama. So they turn to conspiracy theories to empower themselves as the ones who &#8220;get it&#8221;.</p>
<p>As we learn more about the brain we will learn more about why people think the way they do. We live in exciting times. Although, I am concerned that the NY Times is a conspiracy newspaper written by Jews to achieve world domination. You can read about it in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. (Just kidding!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x5951.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5392" title="article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x595" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/article-0-128400E7000005DC-353_468x5951-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></a>It was last Pesach that the NY Times slipped an <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/31/thoughts-on-kiryas-joel-the-poorest-city-in-america/" target="_blank">article about Kiryas Joel</a> under the blogosphere&#8217;s radar. This year, the Post slipped an article almost under that same radar about a reality show featuring ex-hasids. But just because many of the blogs hibernate during Pesach, doesn&#8217;t mean that we can&#8217;t talk about the show now.</p>
<p>Details are scant, but it seems that several of our more well-known ex-hasids will be starring in a reality show. We met Pearlperry Reich and Shauli Gros on the Dr. Phil show (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/03/05/rabbi-shmuley-is-more-embarrassing-than-pearlperry-reich-on-the-dr-phil-show-and-analysis/">Pearlperry Reich on the Dr. Phil Show</a>). Since then, we have become friends on Facebook. Now they are joining forces with Luzer Twersky to tell the world about how they left their homes and their previous lives.</p>
<p>The story is familiar enough. An insular, old-fashioned world meets the fast-paced, liberal world. The results are bound to be emotional, funny, and dramatic. The show has not yet been picked up, so there&#8217;s a chance it never airs. If it does air, the stars hope it will improve the lives of the members of the communities they left. By giving a strong voice to the ex-hasid, the show might expose some of the less savory aspects of insular life. If the claims are false, the show will be a terrible pock on the Jewish community. If the claims are true, then either we should take pride in those claims or if they are negative, try to fix them.</p>
<p>But in the end, this show is a terrible idea.<span id="more-5390"></span> I can only assume that the stars of this show have never seen reality TV shows. These shows are train wreck television. The entire point of these shows is to portray uncomfortable situations and manufacture drama. No one comes out of a reality show smelling like roses. No one. Ever.</p>
<p>Put it this way &#8211; words that have never been stated after watching a reality show: &#8220;Wow, those people seem like such lovely human beings. I hope they have much success in their lives and hopefully I can be as well-adjusted as them one day.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, as much as I am interested in the story that these people have to tell and as much as I empathize with many of their struggles, I can only see how this show will only harm them and their new ex-hasid community. There are other, better ways of pushing their agendas forward. If you have a message and an idea, the worst way that I can think of to spread that idea is on a reality show. How about a documentary? Or a well-written informative website? Or a speaking tour? Or writing a book? Reality TV is lazy. It is lazy for its producers. It is lazy for its viewers. But most of all, in this case, it is lazy for its stars.</p>
