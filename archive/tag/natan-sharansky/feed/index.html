We hope.</p>
<p>The world has become witnesses to a very public and somewhat embarrassing battle over the Kotel. Although instead of the familiar disagreements between Palestinians and Israelis, this scuffle pitted Jew against Jew.</p>
<p>The Kotel is maintained by orthodox Jews who would like to preserve an atmosphere that is similar to orthodox synagogues and everything that entails. Many find attempts by women to lead small prayer services offensive. The women prayer services are often led by Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall. Hoffman has been arrested several times for leading such services and for the severe offense of wearing a particular kind of tallit.</p>
<p>The conflict was escalating and becoming more and more ugly with each passing arrest. More orthodox Jews cast aspersion toward Hoffman and more liberal minding Jews stood behind her.</p>
<p>The Forward first reported a breakthrough in negotiations headed by Natan Sharansky. The NY Times spoke with Sharansky and describes the plan:<span id="more-6922"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mr. Sharansky’s proposal involves expanding and improving the areas accessible for prayer at the wall to include the southern section known as Robinson’s Arch which, under his plan, would be open for Jews wishing to pray in a less Orthodox, more egalitarian style 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The main prayer section, which is now divided into men’s and women’s sections, would remain the domain of more traditional worshippers.</p>
<p>Sounds good to me!</p>
<p>Sharansky has close to ties to my family and my shul. My great uncle was responsible for his release from Soviet prison (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Greenwald#Natan_Sharansky" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) and Sharansky&#8217;s daughter married a young man who grew up in my shul. His father, <strong>Alan Danziger</strong>, is the president of Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>Alan told me that Sharansky was charged with coming up with a solution and he (jokingly) asked my advice. I suggested a three section Kotel (men, women, egalitarian) with each group getting use of the best area in the northenmost corner of the Kotel once in a while. I also thought it wise to have non-orthodox Jews participate in the administration of the Kotel.</p>
<p>So I am very pleased with the proposal. It&#8217;s not exactly what I suggested, but close enough. I really hope all parties will agree. The NY Times reports that Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall are not completely satisfied with the plan <em>&#8220;but we will compromise. You don’t always have to be right, you have to be smart, and compromise is a sign of maturity and understanding what’s at stake here.”</em></p>
<p>Compromise is good. Let&#8217;s hope everyone will be willing to accept this proposal.</p>
<p>Some have argued that people who are not comfortable with the current orthodox arrangements at the Kotel are few in number and they are too few to matter. I think this is ludicrous. Perhaps if more people were made to feel comfortable at our Holiest place, more people who are not orthodox sympathetic would come to the Kotel to pray and be inspired.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that is a good result.</p>
