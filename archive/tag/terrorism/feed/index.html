				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6981" alt="stop-terrorism" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/stop-terrorism-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" />Americans are still reeling from a terror attack in Boston last week. The bombers have been identified through fairly conclusive evidence and one is in custody while the other is dead. They were immigrants from war torn Chechnya and they practiced Islam.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s the word. Whenever we hear about a violent crime, or regional violence and we hear the word Islam, there is a tendency to presume that the violence is <em>because </em>of Islam. Part of this is because many violent Muslims claim to be acting for the sake of Allah or Jihad. Also, there are a large number of verses in the Quran and Hadith that seem to promote violence and so outsiders can connect the dots and attribute the violence to religion.</p>
<p>Our minds yearn for simple answers to explain complicated things. We want one answer for everything. Our brains are wired with this built-in laziness. It is the same laziness that creates and perpetuates stereotypes through selection bias. It&#8217;s just easier for our brains to make everything simple, and so we try. I submit that my blog post is <em>also</em> an oversimplification. But it is an alternative explanation that does away with bigotry and racism. For that reason alone I think it is worth considering.</p>
<p>For the sake of this post we are going to assume that there is more violence in Arab Muslim countries and that Arab Muslims commit more acts of terror than other groups. <strong>NOTE: I believe these assumptions can be rebutted. However my point will stand even if these assumptions are conceded. Maybe another time we will discuss these presumptions.</strong></p>
<p><em>If you are going to comment on this post here or on Facebook, or wherever, I ask that you please address the arguments and stick to facts instead of just calling people names. Thank you.</p>
<p><span id="more-6980"></span></p>
<p></em></p>
<p>In the USA there are about 40 murders every day. Over 14,000 people are senselessly killed in our country every year. The top countries on a list of the rate of intentional deaths around the world is dominated by non-Arab Muslim countries. Death is everywhere. Violence is everywhere. It&#8217;s not an Arab Muslim phenomena.</p>
<p>Why do people kill? What are the factors that create the social circumstances ripe for murder and death?</p>
<p>I think the first thing we need to do is distinguish between isolated murders and systematic killing. [By systematic killing we don't mean genocide. That is a government systematically killing people. We are talking about subcultures where killing is part of normal life.] In the USA many homicides are part of systematic killing cycles. Gang wars, drug cartel and mafia killings are a very large percentage of USA homicides. These are not isolated killings, they are part of a culture of killing and death. We are going to ignore isolated murders because terrorism fits more neatly into the latter category.</p>
<p>In the parts of the USA that we find systematic killing, specifically street gangs and to a lesser extent organized crime I think you&#8217;ll find that their social environments provide very few escape hatches. One is born into a neighborhood or a family and that becomes that person&#8217;s identity. It is very hard to break free from the default positions we are born into. Even more so for those with few economic prospects on the outside. Inevitably, education is shunned and it becomes even more difficult to leave.</p>
<p>People living in those conditions don&#8217;t have as much to live for as the rest of us. We view the world through a lens of opportunity, they view it through a lens of oppression. Their violent way of life is not excusable. It is destructive and they are culpable for their bad choices, but we can understand that their struggle is quite different than the white middle class American&#8217;s struggle.</p>
<p>These are the conditions that are ripe for violence: Little hope of improving one&#8217;s situation, a culture where violence is mistaken for bravery, where education is not valued and hard to come by, and primitive views of &#8220;might is right&#8221; prevail. This is what our gang culture looks like in the USA.</p>
<p>It also happens to be what the world of many Arab Muslims in developing countries looks like.</p>
<p>Another example. In apartheid South Africa, there was a lot of black on white violence. I am not excusing the violence. However, it is obvious to us in hindsight that an oppressed group of people with the same conditions that are present in gang culture would resort to violence. They have nothing to lose and everything to gain. These are the conditions ripe for death and violence.</p>
<p>A third example. Before terrorism we had the Cold War. The enemy was Communism and its violent fanatics. I think we can draw similar parallels to Communist violence as well. People had nothing to lose and everything to gain by being violent. It takes a long time to change that mindset. As it stands today, Russia still has a high homicide rate (more than double the rate in the USA). The conditions have not changed enough in the last few decades to give people the hope and opportunity to succeed. Violence is still rampant.</p>
<p>While it is true that all Arab Muslim terrorists read the Quran and may even claim to be acting for the sake of Allah, those are not necessarily the reasons the terrorists among them act violently. It is more reasonable to assume that they systematically kill for the same reason that other people kill. It is a much more elegant explanation.</p>
<p>It seems to me, that once a person is set upon a path of violence they will use whatever justification that they can find. Arab Muslims will use the Quran, gang members will use the &#8220;Code&#8221;, blacks suffering from apartheid will use the struggle for freedom, Cold War Communists will use the &#8220;Mother Country&#8221; as their justifications. The ideologies may or may not be corrupt or wrong, but to people seeking an escape they provide the after-the-fact justification. In other words, even if the Quran was as genteel as Confucius, people living under these conditions would likely turn to violence anyway.</p>
<p>At this point, we don&#8217;t know the motivations of Boston Bombers. However, just because they are Muslim and killers does not mean that they killed because of their Muslim faith. There are many other reasons that people kill and there is a strong correlation between all systematic killings that spans the racial and religious gamut. I know that Glenn Beck could probably explain how Communism and Gangs and apartheid Blacks are all really using the same ideology as Islam, but we are trying to have a mature conversation about this issue.</p>
<p>Further, even if they claim that they acted on behalf of their religious beliefs, this is not an indictment of Islam. Anything can be used as justification for death. It is only an indictment of their flawed justification. And if we are looking for an explanation, stopping with &#8220;The Quran&#8221; is lazy, and in all likelihood very, very wrong.</p>
<p>The next level of this discussion is that it is wrong to profile all Arab Muslims the same way it would be wrong to profile all poor people with inferior education. Yes, many terrorists are Arab Muslims but by focusing on that one point and ignoring the rest of their social conditions is too lazy and too unfair. If we eliminated Islam from the world people would just use a different justification for their violence. Murder does not require religion or ideology. But systematic killing can usually be traced to a combination of factors that transcend religion.</p>
<p>Our collective energies are more wisely targeted if we can help remove the barriers to education and financial success in the communities where violence is so prevalent. Whether it&#8217;s on the South Side of Chicago, Watts in Los Angeles, East Baltimore, Cairo, or some remote village in Chechnya we can do more to eliminate the social ills that make violence and terrorism possible. We need to give them the tools they need to succeed. Most of all we need to give them hope.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/7-23-12-Munich-moment-of-silence_full_600.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5873 alignleft" title="7-23-12-Munich-moment-of-silence_full_600" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/7-23-12-Munich-moment-of-silence_full_600-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>A while back I wrote about the IOC&#8217;s decision not to have a moment of silence for the Israeli terror victims in Munich at the &#8217;72 games. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/18/there-will-not-be-a-moment-of-silence-for-the-victims-of-terrorism-at-the-munich-olympic-games/">There Will Not Be a Moment of Silence For the Victims of Terrorism at the Munich Olympic Games</a>) I disagreed with the decision, but I also challenged those who wished to have a moment of silence to garner support for their cause and pressure the IOC, not simply demand a moment of silence.</p>
<p>That is exactly what they did.</p>
<p>People like President Obama and other world leaders past and present supported the idea of a moment of silence at the Opening Ceremonies. This has been seen as a slap in the face to Israel and Jews worldwide. Add this insult to the BBC&#8217;s incredibly narrow idea of not calling Jerusalem the capital of Israel, it&#8217;s easy to feel like everyone is out to get us.<span id="more-5872"></span></p>
<p>I just want to point out that the IOC is commemorating the Munich Massacre with a moment of silence and the IOC chairman will be attending a memorial in September in Munich, and they already had a brief moment of silence at  moment of silence in the Olympic Village (see photo above for proof).</p>
<p>These things have either already happened or will happen. The <em>only</em> thing we won&#8217;t be getting is a moment of silence at the actual Opening Ceremony. Quite honestly, I understand the reluctance toward a moment of silence at an international spectacle like the Opening Ceremony. Like it or not, the moment of silence would be polarizing and you can be sure that some knuckleheads would ruin the moment by doing something inappropriate. It&#8217;s a matter of quality control. Further, I don&#8217;t know that the Opening Ceremony is an appropriate time to put the focus on one nation. It&#8217;s true that terrorism at the Olympics affects everyone, but a moment of silence for Israel&#8217;s terror victims does take the focus off the international community and place it on one particular nation. It&#8217;s just not the right time or place. Finally, 40 is a bit of an arbitrary number. I&#8217;m uncertain why on the 40th anniversary (more than 20, 36 or 48, or 60) it was necessary to make a huge issue over the moment of silence.</p>
<p>But thankfully, the IOC is doing several other things to remember the victims of this horrible act of terrorism. Plus, Bob Costas will be leading a moment of silence on his broadcast of the Games. All in all, the 40th anniversary of the Munich Massacre will not go unremembered or unnoticed. Let us hope and pray that the message is received by those who want the moment of silence and those who need to see a moment of silence observed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/500px-London_Olympics_2012_logo.svg_.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5585" title="500px-London_Olympics_2012_logo.svg" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/500px-London_Olympics_2012_logo.svg_-270x300.png" alt="" width="270" height="300" /></a>The upcoming Olympic Games will mark 40 years since eleven Israeli athletes were killed by Palestinian terrorists at the Olympic Games in Munich. The incident was significant for its symbolism as much as it was significant for the lives it took.</p>
<p>The Olympic Games are supposed to be a symbol of international friendship and a message to the world that despite our differences we can compete together without killing each other. Adding to the feelings of good will was the fact that Munich, Germany was hosting the games. It seemed like the perfect vision of a post-World War II world. Nations coming together to battle on the ball field instead of on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Then tragedy struck. Israeli athletes were taken hostage and their release was to be contingent on the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. A raid ensued in an attempt to rescue the Israelis and during the raid, eleven Israelis were killed. It was an international tragedy. Not only had the terrorists taken the lives of eleven innocents, but they had hijacked the Olympic Games. They turned the games from peace to war.</p>
<p>In light of the 40th anniversary of the massacre, the government of Israel requested that a moment of silence be observed at the 2012 London Games in memory of the Munich Massacre.<span id="more-5581"></span></p>
<p>In a respectful letter, the International Olympic Committee denied the request.</p>
<p>Some are taking this as an affront to Israel. One widow of a terror victim from Munich said that <em>&#8220;If the Olympic Games don&#8217;t say anything, nothing is going to change.&#8221;</em> It is hard for me to understand what she means. There have not been any terror attacks against Israelis at the Olympic Games for 40 years. Apparently, things have changed.</p>
<p>But it gets worse.</p>
<p>In the words of Danny Ayalon:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Unfortunately, this response is unacceptable as it rejects the central principles of global fraternity on which the Olympic ideal is supposed to rest. The terrorist murders of the Israeli athletes were not just an attack on people because of their nationality and religion; it was an attack on the Olympic Games and the international community. Thus it is necessary for the Olympic Games as a whole to commemorate this event in the open rather than only in a side event.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>As much as I would love to see a moment of silence at the Olympic Games, this response does not sit well with me. It seems a bit incongruous for one nation&#8217;s tragedy to create an obligation on the IOC that makes it <em>necessary</em> to have a moment of silence at the games. I appreciate that it is very important to Mr. Ayalon and to Israel, and to me, but that doesn&#8217;t make it necessary.</p>
<p>In fact, if it was not just something that Israel wanted on behalf of itself and in reality it was something that all nations would agree is important, where are the statements from all those other nations that they would like to observe a moment of silence? I have a feeling if 30-40 nations wrote &#8220;<em>amicus briefs&#8221;</em> supporting the moment of silence the response from the IOC would be different.</p>
<p>So here is my suggestion. Get the other countries to request a moment of silence and have the entire group to make a strong push for the remembrance. Lashing out at the IOC is probably not the best idea.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/stop-sign.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4988" title="stop-sign" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/stop-sign-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" /></a>Thugs and hoodlums from extremist religious groups in Israel have been terrorizing fellow Jews for some time now. They have done so without fear of condemnation or retribution from the religiously adjacent charedi community. This recent wave of violence is not new nor is it shocking or surprising.</p>
<p>Spitting on young girls, calling women whores, forcing segregation at bus stops and on buses are all acts cut from the same cloth as the violence at Manny&#8217;s Bookshop and a political beating in Meah Shearim. We&#8217;ve known about this for a while. Nobody has said a word.</p>
<p>However, this time the media found out about it. So now it&#8217;s national and international news.</p>
<p>This has prompted responses and condemnations from rabbis, rabbinic authorities and lay people. That&#8217;s great. Finally. The problem is that these condemnations are so weak, hedged and long-winded that they, in my opinion, are a failure.</p>
<p>There is only one way to condemn violence and abuse towards women. That would be something like this:<span id="more-4987"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>We strongly condemn any and all violence towards women under any and all circumstances. Those who commit such acts of violence will feel the full effect and power of the religious and secular court system. They will be excommunicated from all religious circles and are heretofore to be considered persona non grata. If you know of any individuals who have abused anyone, whether verbally or physically notify the police and rabbinic leadership immediately.</strong></p>
<p>What we don&#8217;t need is an explanation of how these people are not &#8220;real charedim&#8221;. We don&#8217;t need poetry on the majesty of tznius. We don&#8217;t need snide remarks about the secular media. Just speak out against violence, promise retribution and to take action.</p>
<p>Enough with the apologetics and handwringing.</p>
<p><em>Feel free to copy and paste my version of an appropriate condemnation on all the blogs and news sites that have published the watered down condemnations to this point. If you can, please credit this blog. Thanks.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/126571-gilad-shalit-release.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4740" title="126571-gilad-shalit-release" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/126571-gilad-shalit-release-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>One of the more dramatic events in my lifetime has been the recent release of Gilad Shalit. I think most Jews thought he would never go home. He was released, the price was very high and now a week later we can reflect on the deal and its ramifications.</p>
<p>Perhaps the two biggest complaints that supporters of Israel have expressed are related not to Shalit, but to the 1000+ prisoners exchanged for Shalit. These complaints are divided into two categories. One category refers to the celebrations in Gaza when the prisoners returned. They were given a hero&#8217;s welcome and treated in a way that offended many people who felt that criminals and terrorists should not be celebrated.</p>
<p>I believe this criticism is partially valid. All kinds of prisoners were released. Some were terrorists and murdereres. Others were agitators who jumped the fence or snuck into Israel without permission. They were all released together. The worst offenders were supposedly sent to other countries, not Gaza.</p>
<p>For a governing body to cheer and promote terrorism there is absolutely no justification. It is horrible and should be obvious to any reasonable person that it is bad.</p>
<p>However, I do not take issue with the celebrations of individuals who were welcomed by their families and friends with cheers and whoops of joy. I have seen hardened criminals in American court and seen the reactions of their friends and families when they are released or acquitted. It is the same. I think we can all see that friends and family can be permitted to enjoy the moment their criminal / terrorist family members return home. I do not have a problem with it all.</p>
<p>The second category of complaint refers to the equivocation of some of the media and UN leadership of Shalit and the 1000+ prisoners.<span id="more-4739"></span> A similar complaint has been lodged by some members of the Jewish community against its own members who have equated Shalit with Pollard or Rubashkin. The complaint hods that there is a moral equivalency implied when Shalit and the prisoners are compared. The video below powerfully demonstrates the issue. (Watch it after you finish reading.)</p>
<p>I agree that any moral equivalency is absurd. No normal person could think that Shalit is equal to terrorist or even to Jewish criminals.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t necessarily agree that moral equivalency between Shalit and the terrorists was as common or prevalent as some others might perceive. There is a tendency to expect certain things from media coverage. When these expectations are not met one response is to get upset or point out that the media is biased or anti-Semitic or anti-Israel. I think that perhaps the expectations are simply off.</p>
<p>The media is not reading into each and every word it says like a Talmudic passage. They are reporting and for the sake of brevity, interest, ratings, or many other factors may present a headline or story from which something offensive can be inferred. In my opinion this is a useless exercise.</p>
<p>Take the primary example in the video below. The SkyNet reporter segues from the Shalit story to the &#8220;human element&#8221; of the released prisoners. Somehow this is deemed horribly offensive. I just don&#8217;t see it. There is no implied moral equivalency. What is being said is simply what was remarked above. There <em>is </em>a human element when hundreds of people who have been locked up come home. Isn&#8217;t there? So why the outrage?</p>
<p>I prefer to reserve my outrage for the actual words and acts of the despicable terrorists you laugh and giggle when told how many people they have killed. Sick.</p>
<p>Enjoy the video below.</p>

(<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/15/the-difference-between-murder-and-terrorism/">The Difference Between Murder and Terrorism</a>) Apparently, this was considered inappropriate by some. I was told should not be trying to have a rational, reasoned discussion about terrorism during the Shiva of a terror victim.</p>
<p>Others were aghast that my &#8220;reaction&#8221; to the tragedy was to have an intellectual discussion. This is a dumb complaint. I don&#8217;t need to have an official &#8220;reaction&#8221; before I write anything besides that official &#8220;reaction&#8221;. It should have been obvious that my &#8220;reaction&#8221; was of horror, disgust and immense sadness just like every other human being that heard about the tragedy. My post was only supposed to be supplemental to the obvious.</p>
<p>If you were offended. I am sorry.<span id="more-3926"></span></p>
<p><em>(I&#8217;m not sorry if you thought I was trivializing the act of terror or saying it wasn&#8217;t so bad or rationalizing the act itself. That&#8217;s just ridiculous. I would never and did not ever do anything like that.)</em></p>
<p>What are my non-rational thoughts on the tragedy? Words don&#8217;t do justice to my feelings. I am horrified. I am in pain. I am hurt. I wish I could fix the whole mess and make it better.</p>
<p>The Fogels are holy Jews who died al kiddush Hashem. The Rambam holds that anyone who dies for the simple reason that they are a Jew is kadosh. The Fogels are eternally kedoshim. We can only try to live our lives as kedoshim.</p>
<p>This act of terror crossed all lines. It was not an act of war or uprising. It was an act of cowardice and hate. At least 9/11 was supposedly attacking working adults. This attack on the Fogels destroyed a family and killed a wife / mother and her young children. This is a step beyond war. An invisible but obvious line has been crossed. Hopefully, it will never be crossed again.</p>
<p>As for the aftermath of the tragedy, it once again showed that despite all our differences, whether they be political, religious, ideological, superficial, meaningful, ancient or recent, the Jewish people band together when we need each other most. The unity expressed when faced with tragedy is awe inspiring. It is also a call to action to try not to wait for tragedy to express and feel that unity. We can&#8217;t wait for the Hamans and Hitlers of the world to remind us that a Jew is a Jew is a Jew no matter their beliefs or observance. We need to seek that harmony on our own.</p>
<p>I choose to mourn the Fogels by trying to inspire unity. By making the feeling of connection that every Jews has as of this very moment a permanent feeling of connection we can use this horrible tragedy as an opportunity to break the unfortunate barriers that stand between Jewish people of all stripes and colors.</p>
<p>Together we can do so much more than we can do alone. The Fogels have showed us that. Let&#8217;s make their memory a permanent blessing. <em>Yehi zichram baruch.</em></p>

I was in Israel when the Fogel family was slaughtered in their home. The Israelis I encountered over the days following the attack were split between those in agony and those who refused to contemplate the horror of the attack because it was too painful to consider. It was truly a national tragedy.</p>
<p>Aside from the humanity of the pain and suffering there was political trauma as well. Those who are more right wing were upset that the more lax parts of the Israeli government would even talk with Palestinians about peace. &#8220;There is no peace process&#8221; when a savage can murder a family in their home. Those who are more left wing were disappointed that their peace partners did not do more to prevent the atrocity.<span id="more-3906"></span></p>
<p>As a law student, the first thing I thought of in a legal sense was what would happen in the USA under similar circumstances. I understand that the circumstances are completely different in the USA. I am speaking only hypothetically.</p>
<p>Typically, when 5 people from one family are killed in their home we would consider it a murder. The police would investigate. There would be a search for the serial murderer. Hopefully he would be caught and brought to justice in a court of law. A lawyer would defend him. The prosecution would need to prove their case. The jury would decide the defendant&#8217;s fate. In some states he might even get the death penalty. But before that, there would be several appeals.</p>
<p>When 5 family members living in an Israeli settlement are murdered in their home it is called terrorism. The suspect may be apprehended by the Israeli Defense Forces. He may be assassinated by the IDF. He may be placed in a military prison and exchanged for other prisoners of war left to sit out his days in Palestinian prison.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very different.</p>
<p>But what is so different about the circumstances that makes one person a murderer and one person a terrorist? It&#8217;s not a question that can be taken lightly. We can&#8217;t just answer it by saying &#8220;it&#8217;s obvious&#8221;.</p>
<p>Do we look to motive? Is it because one murderer was trying to kill a family and the other murderer was trying to kill Jews? That&#8217;s not sufficient because we have hate crime enhancements in the USA that deal with crimes like these.</p>
<p>Is it simply that every murder caused by a Palestinian against a Jew is terror? I am not happy with that either. It be similar to the painfully archaic &#8220;gang enhancement&#8221; in the USA that basically makes any crime a memeber of a gang commits a felony in the furtherance of the gang, even when its not. That is not a good rule either.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because when you take all the factors of the murders and all the facts of the circumstances and all the facts of the murderer the only logical conclusion is that it is terrorism? But is that true? Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p>The optimistic part of me still wishes that the heinous act was the work of a crazed man working alone, against the wishes of his friends, family, neighbors and government. I honestly wish we could believe that the murders were just that; murders. I wish I could be absolutely confident that this murderer is a social outcast and acted contrary to the beliefs of his environment.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, it&#8217;s seems painfully obvious that this was an act of terror. I just wish I knew how I knew that.</p>
