				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/562.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6551" title="562" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/562-300x281.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281" /></a>Yoram Hazony wrote a very interesting article for the NY Times Opinionator Blog. I am big fan of Yoram Hazony and I really like his original thinking.</p>
<p>In his article he attempts to address the perfection of God.</p>
<p>The familiar view to orthodox Jews today is that God is All-Knowing, All-Powerful, and All-Good. Hazony makes two primary arguments against this view. One is that it&#8217;s fairly evident Jewish thought on this has evolved. The God the Bible seems to be more limited than the God we talk about today (and have talked about for at least 2000 years). Second, there are philosophical problems with calling God &#8220;All-Everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>The great rabbis of post-Biblical Judaism have done an incredible job of interpreting the passages in the Bible that seem to limit God. Yet, even some of the medieval commentators were comfortable with an anthropomorphic God. This idea has completely fallen out of favor and is now considered heresy almost unanimously.</p>
<p>But we are less adept at dealing with the philosophical concerns of an &#8220;All-Everything&#8221; God. Here there are newer issues that arise out of a better understanding of the world. Perfect is now understood in terms of balances. It is not understood as unlimited quantities of stuff. Further, to assert perfection requires us to have a complete vision of God. We don&#8217;t. God obscures Himself and even God&#8217;s favorite prophet Moses only caught a glimpse of God from the rear.</p>
<p>So Hazony proposes that we resurrect the idea of an imperfect God.<span id="more-6550"></span> The idea is that we hope that God will deal with us faithfully and there is justice. This creates a more true relationship with a more realistic God.</p>
<p>But the reason this idea has fallen out of favor, Hazony proposes, is because philosophers and religious leaders recognize that it is much more powerful to believe in the &#8220;All-Everything&#8221; God than the imperfect God. Hazony concludes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Instead, they have preferred to speak to us of a God consisting of a series of sweeping idealizations — idealizations whose relation to the world in which we actually live is scarcely imaginable. Today, with theism rapidly losing ground across Europe and among Americans as well, we could stand to reconsider this point. Surely a more plausible conception of God couldn’t hurt.</em></p>
<p>This is the core issue of contemporary orthodox Judaism. Is plausibility and minimalism a better weapon against atheism or is mysticism and maximalism a better tool? The ultra-orthodox camp firmly believes that the key is insularity and an expansion of required beliefs. It asks that their adherents shield themselves from the outside world and empirical evidence. The more progressive orthodox groups embrace the challenges of modernity by looking for less familiar views on God and Judaism that are more compatible with modern thinking. It asks their adherents to work through any potential conflict and accept scientific inquiry and some of its conclusions.</p>
<p>The question raised by Hazony is which track is more likely to produce the desired result of devout believers. It&#8217;s a good question. It&#8217;s a different question that what is most comfortable, or what is easier, or what is more intellectually honest. He is simply asking which track has a better chance of survival.</p>
<p>I think he is correct that eventually it will be nearly impossible to ignore the outside world and the conflicts between it and the more maximalist positions. Granted, there will be contradictions to the minimalist positions as well, but it is easier to swallow a small pill than to swallow a beach ball.</p>
<p>Read Hazony&#8217;s article and join the conversation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/320px-Targum.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4583" title="320px-Targum" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/320px-Targum-257x300.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="300" /></a>Rachel Held Evans is an Evangelical who is living Biblically. And by Biblically, I mean she is following the Old Testament and the New Testemant, literally. She is going completely by the book.</p>
<p>Evans is making a point. She is devoutly Christian and like her co-religionists, believes that the Bible is true. Her point is that all Christians pick and choose which rules, tenets and beliefs they wish to keep and discard those which they do not. Therefore it is completely disingenuous to suggest that one way of thinking or acting is Biblical, part of the &#8220;Christian Worldview&#8221; or emblematic of &#8220;Christian values&#8221; when the same book that is being used to support those values contains values that are 180 degrees different.</p>
<p>It is a salient point and it has become a lightning rod (at least according to Slate) for many Christians.</p>
<p>Evans has used this project to take aim at several respected Christian leaders and as a result has even adjusted some of their thinking. It seems to be working.</p>
<p>Many orthodox Jews might think that Evans is living somewhat like an orthodox Jew. This is incorrect.<span id="more-4582"></span> Evans is living by the literal word of the Old AND New Testament. That is not very Jewish at all. But more importantly, Evans is living without an rabbinic interpretation. There is no Oral Law in Evans&#8217; exercise. In fact, I would venture that her life right now would be almost completely unfamiliar to an orthodox Jew. She is living like a Karaite.</p>
<p>To me, this is a stark reminder that orthodox Judaism is an Oral Law based religion. It is based on a tradition going back thousands of years and would be virtually impossible for us to accurately recreate from the Old Testament.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting to me is how I felt when I reading the article about Ms. Evans. The Slate article describes her as an &#8220;insider&#8221;. She is not making these critiques from an Atheist or anti-Chrisitan point of view. She just has a slightly different twist on her faith. She is not breaking any of the rules of her faith but is challenging many of the social, political and pseudo-religious aspects of her faith.</p>
<p>I try to do the same with my religion.</p>
<p>I like to challenge the status quo and conventional thinking. If only to allow for my religion to be more faithful to its history and be more inclusive. The goals and tactics may slightly differ. But my blog and talks from the pulpit are sometimes very similar in style to that of Ms. Evans. Just read the posts that have the most comments. Those are the ones that ruffled feathers and challenged the social, political and pseudo-religious aspects of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>So Ms. Evans, I salute you. And here is to many more years of making a difference!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gutenberg-bible.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3882" title="gutenberg-bible" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/gutenberg-bible-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>There is a very prominent version of the English Bible that got a bit of a make-over week. There were some very notable changes that I think are worth some commentary.</p>
<p>How do these changes come about? About 50 scholars from all faiths have been working on this since 1994. I guess they need to agree or come to a sort of consensus. But it is interesting that 50 humans get the decision as to how words in the Bible will be translated for the next generation.</p>
<p>The scholars claim that the changes don&#8217;t really mess with the meaning of the Bible. They are just making adjustments that account for changes in language over the last few decades. For the most part these changes are needed and correct. For example, holocaust was used to describe certain sacrifices (not humans, obviously) and it has been changed to &#8220;burnt offerings&#8221;. A wise move in my opinion.<span id="more-3881"></span></p>
<p>Another good choice was changing &#8220;booty&#8221; to &#8220;spoils of war&#8221; because booty now means something completely different to most folks. (Or maybe not)</p>
<p>But the most significant change is the translation of the passage in Isaiah that supposedly foretells the virgin birth of Jesus. Believe me, I have gone at this with missionaries many times. They have always insisted that <em>Alma</em> means virgin. Well, lo and behold, the new edition correctly translates <em>Alma</em> as a &#8220;young woman&#8221;.</p>
<p>So is that it? Will missionaries stop proving the birth of a Jesus was predicted by Isaiah? Who knows.</p>
<p>And for the record, this translation DOES NOT indicate any change of stance on the virgin birth by the scholars. &#8220;None whatsoever&#8221;.</p>
<p>Well it seems hard to see how it won&#8217;t. But either way, honesty is a good thing. Accurate translations are a good thing. Hopefully missionaries will stop using that verse incorrectly to make their point.</p>
<p>Of course, sales will skyrocket for the new edition. After all, the Bible is a best seller.</p>
