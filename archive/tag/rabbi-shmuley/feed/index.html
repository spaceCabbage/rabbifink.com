<p>It seems the &#8220;impossible&#8221; has happened again. Kelly Myzner lost custody of her children last week.</p>
<p>I have not seen the court documents. Although I have read a few articles about the case and I am well aware that every situation has at least two sides to the story.</p>
<p>If you want to see one version of the facts go to Unpious and read <a href="http://www.unpious.com/2013/05/ex-hasidic-mother-loses-custody-of-children/">Ex-Hasidic Mother Loses Custody of Children</a> by Shulem Deen. Whether the facts are the way the ex-hasid community presents them or not, the phenomena is real.<span id="more-7101"></span></p>
<p>It is true that <em>baalei teshuva </em>in the chasidic community will be set up with less than stellar matches. It is true that sometimes those less than stellar young men or women have personality defects. It is true that personality defects worsen in one&#8217;s 20&#8242;s and are further exacerbated by marriage and parenthood. It is true that people who are in bad marriages will see the worst of their society and will look outside their community. It is true that people in a marriage can get fed up with one another and find themselves in completely different religious spheres. Sometimes the couple will seek divorce.</p>
<p>What happens next is the real point here.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the primary caregiver &#8211; usually the mother, is awarded primary custody. However, sometimes the mother is denied custody for a potpourri of reasons. One reason that has been used in court proceedings is that the children should stay in the same religious environment. Usually this means that the parent who is deviating will lose custody. When it is the mother, the courts will sometimes deny the mother custody.</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons for this: First, the assumption could be that deviating from the agreed upon religious beliefs in the marriage is like a breach of contract. She breached, so he wins. Second, deviating could be viewed as a a symptom of imbalance. Third, the children have a status quo of religious practice and taking that away from them and them away from it is unfair collateral damage. Fourth, the court systems are rigged and they are bought and paid for by the ultra-orthodox community. Fifth, the ultra-orthodox community projects a unified front and unwavering support for their own so the chances that the children will be cared for increases within the ultra-orthodox community. Sixth, the ultra-orthodox community pays for a super-lawyer while the deviating party gets by with a legal aid lawyer and the super-lawyer wins.</p>
<p>I am not saying that all these reasons are true, fair, or valid. However, they are all part of the equation. So I don&#8217;t think that the sole reason anyone loses custody is because they deviated from the religious beliefs. But religion is definitely used as a weapon in these proceedings.</p>
<p>My feeling is that the children of these families are going to need their mothers more than most children. They will have a hard time throughout their lives due to the disparate religious beliefs of their parents and families. As long as the mother is a good mother, the mother should be taking care of the children. A good mother has nothing to do with religion. Good mothers are everywhere, not just in the ultra-orthodox community.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be a very strong reason to deny the mother custody. I don&#8217;t think that being an atheist is a valid reason. More importantly, I don&#8217;t love the idea of the secular court system weighing the religious beliefs of the parents to determine custody. It&#8217;s probably not a good idea and it might not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.</p>
<p>Most importantly, using children as pawns in any custody battle is deplorable. But when children are used to keep people in the fold we cross the line from deplorable to cult-like. The community does not own the children. That is what happens in a cult. Parents are responsible to raise their children as they deem fit. If the parents have differing opinions on those issues, it is their issue and they must resolve it. But using the brute force of a strong insular community to win the day is just not acceptable.</p>
<p><em>If I see the court documents I will be able to confirm the particulars of this case. In the meantime these are my general thoughts.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9652295787/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9652295787"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5057" title="kosher-jesus" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/kosher-jesus.jpeg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>I&#8217;ll be honest. There is very little that I like about Rabbi Shmuley. I rarely agree with his perspectives on life, Jews and Judaism. But recently I find myself defending him in my mind against the latest round of accusations against him.</p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuley has written a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9652295787/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9652295787" target="_blank">Kosher Jesus</a>. The book is a retelling of Jesus based on some (fringe) historical research. The book portrays the true Jesus as a man who was mostly a Torah abiding Jew but sought to establish a niche within Judaism for his personal views and style. He was later, much later, hijacked as a deity by followers of his teachings in an effort to rebel against Judaism and start a new religion.</p>
<p>At least that is what I was able to gather from the descriptions of the book on various websites. That&#8217;s because, despite what you may think, <em>THE BOOK HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED</em>.</p>
<p>I know this might come as a shock seeing as how Rabbi Shmuley has already been branded as a heretic for writing a book that almost no one  has read. In article after article, I have seen calls for Rabbi Shmuley to be ousted from Judaism or worse because of what he has ostensibly written. And this is why I come to his defense.<span id="more-5056"></span></p>
<p>Screeds against a man who has written a book that has not been read by the ones raving against him. <a href="http://zootorah.com/controversy/controversy.html" target="_blank">I have seen this movie already</a>. It doesn&#8217;t end well for anyone.</p>
<p>Criticism and discussion are important parts of any functioning society. Just open the Talmud and you&#8217;ll see many opinions and reasoning that explains those opinions that we do not follow today. It&#8217;s a discussion. There is argument. But what you won&#8217;t find is rabbis calling for someone&#8217;s head because of a book title or brief dust jacket description. Further, if there is a point to be made, make the point! Yelling very loudly that Rabbi Shmuley is X and Y and therefore A, B and C must happen to him sounds like the ravings of a lunatic.</p>
<p>How about this?</p>
<p>Read the book. Write a critique of the book based on actual research and facts. Then we can have a mature discussion about the issues.</p>
<p><strong>My two cents:</strong></p>
<p>I reserve judgment until I have read the book. (If I read the book at all.) But I am curious why this is the book Rabbi Shmuley chose to write. I know what he says in interviews or in his articles but it still doesn&#8217;t add up. I am concerned that the book may have just been written to be provacative, to gain publicity and generate controversy. I could be wrong. But that&#8217;s just how it smells to me.</p>
<p><strong>One more cent:</strong></p>
<p>In order for Jesus to become kosher, everything that Christians teach must be wrong. Is that really a road we want to go down?</p>
<p><strong>Someone else&#8217;s two cents:</strong></p>
<p>Read Rabbi Gil&#8217;s excellent post on the issue of a kosher Jesus here: <a href="http://torahmusings.com/2012/01/three-easy-steps-to-a-kosher-jesus/" target="_blank">Hirhurim</a></p>
<p><strong>Spend more than two cents:</strong></p>
<p>And buy the book here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9652295787/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9652295787" target="_blank">Kosher Jesus</a></p>

<p><strong>Kiddush Club:</strong> (noun) <em>a slang term applied wherever an informal group of people leave a synagogue&#8217;s sanctuary during Jewish services on Shabbat (Saturday) morning to congregate, make kiddush (frequently over liquor) and socialize. Participants often leave services during the Haftorah reading or the sermon. &#8211; </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiddush_club" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Rabbi Shmuley Yanklowitz has a scathing indictment of kiddush clubs in The Jewish Week. The Orthodox Union has banned kiddush clubs from their shuls as well.</p>
<p>Citing &#8220;some studies&#8221; that indicate alcoholism as high as 10-15% for Jews in general, Rabbi Shmuley argues that kiddush clubs are a destructive force in our synagogues. It seems that in Rabbi Shmuley&#8217;s kiddush clubs, men stagger back into shul completely drunk. It seems to Rabbi Shmuley that Jewish teens abuse alcohol because of kiddush clubs. His writing describes the kiddush clubs as being &#8220;exclusive groups&#8221; in &#8220;back rooms&#8221; reminiscent of the back rooms in a Las Vegas casino or illegal high stakes poker game.</p>
<p>I have been to many kiddush clubs in many shuls. None fits the description of Rabbi Shmuley. None.<span id="more-4504"></span></p>
<p>There is no place for drunkenness in shul. It is prohibited to pray while inebriated. Men who get drunk during kiddush club have serious problems that can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t be solved by writing scathing diatribes against kiddush club or even by banning them.</p>
<p>I have previously written about the problem of insular communities denying internal problems. I agree that alcohol abuse may be one of those issues. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/07/15/social-issues-raised-by-the-recent-tragedy/">Social Issues Raised by the Recent Tragedy</a>)</p>
<p>But, I disagree that kiddush clubs must be discouraged or banned.</p>
<p>Going to shul on Shabbos is a religious <em>and</em> social experience. Many people enjoy the social aspects of communal prayer. I believe that this element of prayer within Judaism was a stroke of genius by the rabbis of the Talmud. Making a religious experience such as prayer intertwined with a social experience is a great way to balance two basic human needs.</p>
<p>Shabbos services are quite long. I don&#8217;t think they need to be shorter nor do I think anyone should feel bound to stay inside the sanctuary for the duration of the services. Further, most men come to shul not having eaten breakfast as per the halachic requirement that one not eat before morning services.</p>
<p>A kiddush club is just a more organized way of taking a few minute break from shul. I don&#8217;t think there is anything terribly wrong about that. Like anything, the kiddush club can&#8217;t cancel out the religious experience of attending shul. But to say that it automatically turns one&#8217;s Jewish education into a waste of money is unfair and unwarranted.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if a kiddush club gives people some extra motivation to come to shul, it is a classic example of &#8220;מתוך שלא לשמה בא לשמה&#8221; &#8211; the Talmudic concept of using ulterior motives to do the right thing. Similarly, if a shot of whiskey and some herring helps one enjoy the services a bit more, it is hard to see why it should be banned. When one is basically fasting until midday, a kiddush club can be a great pick-me-up during the long Shabbos services.</p>
<p>The kiddush clubs that I have participated in, were friendly, quick and pretty harmless overall. There is no reason all kiddush clubs can&#8217;t be the same as those. There may be a few horrible kiddush clubs, but if there are, the people who make them horrible are the problem, not the clubs themselves.</p>
<p>In short, in my experience, kiddush clubs are not as seedy or nefarious as Rabbi Shmuley alleges. Some clubs may be as bad as he claims. Even in those cases, it seems to me that the problem is the participants are their drinking problems as a whole, not the actual club. Teens may wish to experiment with alcohol. I know I did. Parents and community members need to be responsible for the teens in their lives. Eliminating kiddush clubs won&#8217;t translate into teens not being enticed by alcohol. Making the claim, based on &#8220;some (unnamed) studies&#8221; that Jewish alcoholism is at 10-15% has no relationship to kiddush clubs. A tiny percentage of Jews go to shul; an even smaller percentage participate in kiddush clubs. It is hard enough to see correlation, let alone causation.</p>
<p>Shul needs to be more fun, more engaging, more social, if a kiddush club contributes to these goals I can&#8217;t see why they should be completely shunned. People always need to be responsible about what they do. A hallmark of the non-Charedi world is the willingness to let people make their own choices and give them the tools to make those choices. Not to limit those choices with bans and polemics.</p>
<p>There are some actual benefits to the typical kiddush club. In my opinion, if they are done right they are worth keeping around.</p>
