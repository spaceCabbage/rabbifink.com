The impression one gets from reading the news is that there is an impending Armageddon. The lines in the sand are being drawn, sides are being chosen, heroes and villains are being portrayed.</p>
<p>It is true that the governments of the two nations are ideologically opposed to one another. It is also true that much of the talk regarding this conflict comes from the fringes of each nation. The fundamentalists of Iran dreaming of a region free of the Zionist usurpers and the right wing of Israel (backed by the right wing of the United States) leaving the negotiating table, assuming there ever was a negotiating table, and embracing the challenge of a full blown military operation.</p>
<p>But what do the people want?<span id="more-5493"></span></p>
<p>For thousands of years, leaders of men have called their followers into war for the sake of whatever the leaders want. In ancient times, in medieval times, in modern times, it made no difference to the warrior if he fought under the flag of red or blue. But it mattered to the their leaders. Citizens born in Germany fought for the Axis Powers and people born in England fought for the Allied Powers.</p>
<p>The men who fight, kill, and die in war have the least to gain or lose by war. Usually, the people at the top, who are the furthest from harm&#8217;s way have the most to gain from war. If they win, they control more people. If they lose, they are relegated to civilian status or worse, they are dead.</p>
<p>War in the 21st century almost seems anachronistic. I absolutely respect and revere those heroes in the armed forces who dedicate their lives to our safety. It just seems to me that humanity&#8217;s collective resources should be more efficiently spent in our current era of enlightenment. When people were less sophisticated war made a lot more sense than it does today.</p>
<p>So what do the people of Iran and Israel want?</p>
<p>According to some peace activists in Israel and Iran, the answer is that they want peace. The rallying cry of the Israeli activists, <strong>Ronny Edry</strong> and <strong>Michal Tamar</strong> is &#8220;<em>How can I hate someone I don&#8217;t even know?</em>&#8220;. First of all, they are absolutely right. How <em>can </em>you? Taking it one step further, some Iranian peace activists on Facebook are lobbying for the Israelis to win a Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts.</p>
<p>I know there are cynics out there who think that this is all part of some plot to soften the Israelis so that they are easier to destroy in the inevitable war. There are people who will find this post offensive. There were plenty who found the cartoon at the top of this post offensive when it was floating around Facebook. But I do believe that there are good people everywhere and there are plenty of peace loving people in all countries. They may not be in positions of leadership or authority, but they exist. Harnessing the power of the Internet, these people can find a common voice and perhaps their voice of reason will prevail.</p>
<p>As our world shrinks, it is harder and harder to invent fake boogeymen for others to despise. How much longer can fascist countries lie to their citizens about freedom and liberty? I don&#8217;t think it can be much longer. The fact is that information is impossible to censor and good, intelligent, passionate people are finding that they share more in common with the average citizen of Israel or even Iran than they do with the crazy leaders who want World War III.</p>
<p>Let us hope that the Internet can help spread this message of unity and commonality among groups of people who are not yet friends. Let us hope that our young men and women will be spared the horrors of battle. Let us hope that we can find enough in common with our fellow human beings that killing another for the sake of nationalism or pride will be so abhorrent that it will be eradicated.</p>
<p>If we communicate and share common goals and experiences, we can change the way enemies view one another. There has never been a better time.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</em></span></p>
<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Yaakov’s Shlomim</h2>
<p>Following the dramatic news of Yosef Hatzaddik’s survival in the flesh pots of Mitzrayim, Yaakov Avinu readies himself to visit his long lost son. With vigor and alacrity he packs his bags. Taking his entire family and all of his possessions in tow he head towards Be’er Sheva. Why Be’er Sheva? Chazal explain, it was years earlier that, “<em>vayeitzei Yaakov miBe’er Sheva</em>,” that Yaakov’s life travail from Lavan to Yosef commenced upon his departure from Beer Sheva. Now that his life had come full circle he went back to Be’er Sheva, to offer thanks to Hashem Yisborach in a <em>makom Tefilah</em> of his fathers, the place where it all began.</p>
<p>Energized with a renewed sense of <em>simchas hachyim,</em> Yaakov Avinu arrives in Be’er Sheva and immediately brings a <em>korban</em> of thanks to the <em>Ribbono Shel Olam</em>. However, unlike all <em>korbanos</em> offered heretofore, from the time of Noach and Avraham until this climactic moment, Yaakov does not bring a <em>korban Olah</em>, which is<em> kulo laHashem</em>. Rather, he offers <em>zevachim</em>, <em>shlomim</em> sacrifices. Offerings which are shared with and enjoyed by all. Interestingly, the Torah records that he offers them to the <em>Elokei</em> <em>Aviv</em> Yitzchok.</p>
<p><em>Mifarshei hamikrah</em> wonder; firstly, why <em>Shlomim</em>? Secondly, why not also mention <em>Elokei</em> Avraham as Yaakov had in the past? And finally, why wouldn’t one <em>korban</em> suffice, he obviously offered many animals (<em>zevachim</em>).<span id="more-4992"></span> One explanation provides us an extraordinary insight to golus in general and Yaakov Avinu’s persuit of <em>shlaimus</em> in particular. Perhaps it is a <em>remez</em> to the recipe for Geula as well.</p>
<p>The Ramban reminds us that Yitzchok Avinu represents <em>middas hadin</em>. He quotes the Midrash which teaches that Yaakov Avinu realized that with his impending descent to Mitzrayim the dreaded <em>golus</em> was about to begin. He feared for himself and his children. The total tragedy and devastation of the terror of golus could only be realized with the <em>middas hadin</em> (represented by Yitzchok Avinu) in full force. As such, Yaakov Avinu offered <em>shlomim</em> to the <em>Elokei Aviv Yitzchok</em>, to somehow sweeten the <em>middas hadin</em> through his offerings and thereby ensure Klal Yisrael’s ultimate survival through the darkness of golus that loomed ahead. Indeed, by being <em>matil shalom b’olam</em> with his <em>shlomim</em> offerings, the <em>middas harachamim</em> would be aroused. With H<em>akadosh Baurch Hu’s rachamim</em> ignited he could descend to Mitzrayim confident in Klal Yisrael’s future.</p>
<p>This was especially important to Yaakov Avinu who recognized that the descent of the <em>shivtei kah</em> to Mitzrayim started with the <em>kinah</em> of the brothers towards Yosef, an attitude that started with their perception of Yaakov’s playing favorite with his “<em>ben zekunim</em>.” Yaakov in his quest for <em>shlaimus</em> wanted a <em>tikkun</em> for this mistake. Thus the <em>tikkun</em> of his <em>shlomim</em> was personal and communal and he needed to offer at least two animals; one for himself and one for the <em>tzibbur</em>. Indeed, having come full circle, Yaakov wanted to be a <em>shaleim</em> thus <em>shalom</em> was priority number one.</p>
<p>This should not be lost upon us. The darkness of <em>golus</em> still engulfs us. We feel its pain in many ways. Yaakov Avinu taught us that he way to be <em>mamtik</em> the bitter days of exile is through multiple <em>shlomim</em>, creating a greater sense of harmony between each Yid and as a result between Klal Yisrael and <em>Avihem Shebashamayim</em>. The more we feel the <em>din</em> the more we need the <em>shlomim</em>. If one senses that klal Yisrael is feeling the pinch of <em>middas hadin</em> today, then Yaakov Avinu’s model should be our inspiration. We should be ambitious in being <em>marbeh shlomim</em> as <em>ohavei</em> and <em>rodfei shalom</em>! Perhaps this is one more reason why Parshas Vayigash is read immediately following the <em>chag</em> of Chanukah. With the<em> chag urim</em> just behind us we should not forget the Rambam’s concluding message of hilchos Chanukah where he states “<em>godol Hashalom shekol haTorah nitna la’asos shalom ba’olam”</em> It is Yaakov Avinu’s message to us as well. The only way to survive the dark days of golus is through being<em> marbeh shalom</em>. Let us do more. We can start today. In that zechus may we merit that the <em>oseh shalom bimromav</em> will be <em>yaaseh shalom aleinu</em> of <em>kol Yisrael bimhara biyameinu</em>, amen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/gems_e_a000012012.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4481" title="gems_e_a000012012" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/gems_e_a000012012-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>In today&#8217;s NY Times there is an important article showing a more human side of the current conflict in Israel.</p>
<p>According to the Times, it is illegal for a Palestinian from the West Bank to travel to Israel without a permit. A group of Israeli women decided to take a group of Palestinian women to the beach. They all broke the law. The Israeli and Palestinian can be criminally prosecuted. So far, only some of the Israelis have been questioned. None charged.</p>
<p>For the Palestinian women it was their first trip to the beach in their lives. Many of these women are relatives of militants in Israeli prisons. One of them had a brother who was killed while brandishing a knife in a settlement Yeshiva.<span id="more-4480"></span></p>
<p>To be sure, one can certainly take issue with some of the sentiments of the Israeli women and certainly with some of the sentiments of the Palestinian women. I need not point out the obvious. You will see it when you read it.</p>
<p>What is worth noting is that the article makes it super clear that these women experienced a freedom that is completely foreign to them. And they experienced it while in Israeli territory. They were able to smoke in public, dance in public, take off some of their traditional garb and perhaps most of all, they were able to develop relationships with Israelis.</p>
<p>It is part of broader project that involves providing medical and legal assistance to Palestinian women and recently they helped open a kindergarten by donated toys. The women are trying to establish their own rapport with each other and not rely on the rhetoric of their leaders to form their opinions. That is a good thing.</p>
<p>The truth is, I believe that the experience of freedom from militant rule is at least as liberating as the experience of freedom from Israeli rule. The best case scenario for them under militant rule is not even close to the best case scenario under Israeli rule.</p>
<p>It is my hope, that by fostering friendships, experiencing true freedom and dispelling the notion that all Israelis want to kill all Palestinians, a mutual understanding can be reached between citizens, even if the leaders are still lagging behind.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/1101100913_400.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2821" title="1101100913_400" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/1101100913_400-226x300.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="300" /></a>Time Magazine&#8217;s September 13th cover article is called &#8220;Why Israel Doesn&#8217;t Care About Peace&#8221;.</p>
<p>Unlike some other bloggers, I have actually read the article, not just the excerpt or the headline.</p>
<p>It is an unfortunate title for an article. Unfortunate because it has set off a firestorm of condemnation and consternation from Israel lovers everywhere. But even more unfortunate because the title is betrayed by the actual article.</p>
<p>The article is not about why Israel doesn&#8217;t care about peace. The article is about why Israeli citizens are not obsessed with peace.</p>
<p>And that is a compliment.</p>
<p>That is a good thing.<span id="more-2820"></span></p>
<p>The article blames the Palestinian leadership for failing to agree to several peace deals. The moderate Palestinians are praised but the article does not express hope that they will survive. The article justifies the &#8220;Wall&#8221; as a necessary security measure and the Gaza Incursion as a necessary military operation. These two controversial moves have borne fruit &#8211; no suicide attacks in over 2 years and until the August 31 shooting that killed 4 people, no deaths of more than 2 people from any attack in over 2 years. In short, Israel has succesfully quashed the insurgance of violence that began with the second intifada.</p>
<p>What has happened as a result of the relative peace in Israel? Israelis have been industrious. They have been working hard and accumulating wealth. They have been inventing things and contributing to the world economy. They have been building families, taking vacations and enjoying life. They have been acting as if they don&#8217;t live in a war-zone because for the last few years they haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The article indicates that Israelis are happy with the way things are. And they should be.</p>
<p>The article assumes that if there were a peace partner that was willing to recognize Israel as a State and provide the same types of freedoms as Israel provides there would be more talk about peace. But as it stands now, Palestinians are led by politicians who don&#8217;t want to negotiate with Israel seriously and since the violence is under control, there is no reason to discuss anything.</p>
<p>The article concludes the Palestinian issue by saying that Palestinians need to make themselves heard again. How? With violence? Absolutely not. By giving a voice to the moderates who want to talk to Israel. Who can argue with that?</p>
<p>There is no mention of a &#8220;Humanitarian Crisis&#8221; in Gaza. There is no mention of &#8220;War Crimes&#8221;. There is no mention of &#8220;Disproportionate Response&#8221;. No mention of &#8220;Illegal Settlements&#8221;. The article is favorable to Israel. No question about it.</p>
<p>I have two and a half minor gripes with the article.</p>
<p>1) The article kind of glosses over the rocket attacks. Those are not negligible and the fear of attack is worth noting.</p>
<p>2) The article says almost no Palestinians are allowed into Israel. As far as I know that is inaccurate.</p>
<p>3) (only half a gripe) The title is provocative &#8211; but then again, headlines are meant to grab attention. This one grabbed everyone&#8217;s attention. So maybe it was a good title.</p>
<p>But I have two major gripes with Israel friends who lambasted the article.</p>
<p>1) I always hear from Zionist friends that &#8220;It is so good here&#8221;, &#8220;It&#8217;s more dangerous in America&#8221;, &#8220;The economy is booming&#8221;, &#8220;Israel is a Western State&#8221;, etc. And now, Time Magazine is reporting that yes, Israel is in fact a peaceful, productive place and somehow that is not allowed?! Talk about &#8220;Double Standard&#8221;.</p>
<p>2) People should just read the darn thing before complaining about it! There are times where Israel is treated poorly in the court of popular opinion. This is NOT one of those times! We lose credibility if we cry &#8220;Wolf&#8221; any time we can sniff a trace of anti-Israel sentiment. Here, you&#8217;ll need to sniff extra hard.</p>

<p>A few days ago a photo was posted on <a href="http://twitter.com/e_fink" target="_blank">Twitter</a> by the <a href="http://twitter.com/NBA" target="_blank">NBA</a>. Somehow, this photo has been on my mind since I saw it.</p>
<p>In sports, two teams oppose each other under the pretense that they are enemies. Their fans may even dislike one another, (see Celtics / Lakers, Yankees / Red Sox, UNC / Duke, etc,) but in the end, athletes are mostly friendly with each other. Even when athletes get upset or physical with one another, they can remain friends (see Kobe Bryant and Ron Artest).</p>
<p>In the real world, people have a harder time getting along. People divide along political lines, religious lines and country lines.<span id="more-1740"></span></p>
<p>The natural state of people is almost to be at odds with one another. Peace is not just the lack of war. Peace is the active interrelation of two entities in harmonious activity. The opposite of peace is not war, it is merely lack of working together. It is pretty easy for two entities to ignore each other, but that is not peace. Peace is working together. Yet, peace remains so elusive on a grand scale and an individual scale.</p>
<p>This is something that is really hard for me. I honestly (perhaps naively) believe that almost all friction and disagreement is a result of misunderstanding and miscommunication. At our core, we know how to get along but the reality of society and our environment confuses us into discord. Maybe I am wrong, but this what I believe.</p>
<p>That is why seeing this photo was so stirring. It was a photo that showed that when the context changes, when our environment is different, peace is so easy. Sports provides the context for enemies to befriend one another.</p>
<p>Are there two greater enemies in the world today than Israel and Iran?</p>
<p>And yet, below you will see a photo of the best Israeli basketball player, who is now playing for the Sacramento Kings, Omri Casspi and the best Iranian basketball player, playing for the Memphis Grizzlies, Hamed Haddadi. They look like the best of friends. Yet, in their home countries people are dying for their causes in defiance of the opposing cause&#8230;</p>
<p>It is my fervent wish and prayer that we can find peace. Not just peace between nations with differences, but personal peace within ourselves and within our relationships and communities.</p>
<p>Just think of this photo the next time you are about to pass judgment or prolong a disagreement. We can all get along, we can all be a part of peace, we can all unite under the banner of the human race and be tolerant of whoever we encounter.</p>

<p>Tolerance. Love. Peace.</p>
<p>Please.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We had a spectacular Shabbos on the beach this week.</p>
<p>Friday Night Dinner was <a href="http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/recenteqs/Quakes/ci10373093.html" target="_blank">punctuated by a bang</a>. An earthquake struck the area and sent many of us <a href="http://sciencedude.freedomblogging.com/2008/07/31/should-you-duck-under-a-table-during-an-earthquake/" target="_blank">under the table</a> for cover! The earthquake however was no match for the Shabbos Lunch meal the next day&#8230;</p>
<p>For the first time anyone can remember all 3 observant <a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/" target="_blank">Shuls</a> in the <a href="http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/parsha/hollander/bio.htm" target="_blank">Venice</a> / <a href="http://www.yism.org/" target="_blank">Santa Monica</a> area shared a community meal together. The turnout was incredible, the atmosphere was electric and every participant truly enjoyed themselves.</p>
<p>Leslie Friedman (PJC Office), Mildred Wilson and my wife Tova planned and set up the whole thing and we appreciate their efforts.</p>
<p>It was truly a special moment in time and we are so happy with how the event turned out.</p>
<p>Pacific Jewish Center has an open door policy and this week we backed up our promises and ideas of an open door policy with actions. There will be more such events in the future and we look forward to more unity, harmony, peace and love across the Venice / Santa Monica Community. We share more than just a neighborhood, we share common values, goals and ideas. We can all be so much more effective if we work together.</p>
<p>In a couple of months PJC will also be hosting a <a href="http://www.shabbatacrossamerica20.org/" target="_blank">Shabbat Across America</a>. This is an opportunity for anyone who has not experienced a Shabbos with us in Venice to join us. There will be group meals and home hosted meals in the neighborhood and now is the time to begin inviting your friends and neighbors. The week will begin with a special Shabbos <a href="http://finkorswim.com/category/connections/" target="_blank">themed</a> &#8220;<a href="http://www.pjcenter.com/classesprograms.php" target="_blank">Connections</a>&#8221; exploring the beauty and significance of Shabbos. So mark your calendars! March 16 will be the special Connections and March 20 -21 will be the Shabbat Across America Shabbos.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>
