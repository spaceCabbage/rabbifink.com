				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120127-0847151.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5081" title="20120127-084715.jpg" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120127-0847151.jpg?resize=300%2C181" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Last Sunday, two NFL teams advanced to the Super Bowl. Two other teams lost and were sent home for the winter.</p>
<p>One of the notable things about both games was the lack of heroes for the winning teams. Instead of the winning teams making a great play to win the game, both of the losing teams made mistakes that gave the game away. Instead of heroes we had goats.</p>
<p>In the first game, the Ravens made three consecutive heartbreakingly poor plays. First a dropped touchdown, then a bad pass when the quarterback could have run for a few yards and then a missed field goal from close range. The players who made the biggest mistakes, the receive who dropped the pass and the kicker who missed the kick lost the game for their team. Or at least it appears that way to the observer. Obviously mistakes in the beginning of the game are just as costly as mistakes at the end of the game. Yet, we somehow place greater emphasis on the glaring mistakes at the end of the game.</p>
<p>In our house we are fans of the Ravens. It was shocking and disappointing to see them lose in this fashion. Especially so, for my eight year old son. He was upset as I am sure millions of other Ravens fans across the country.</p>
<p>The second game featured an even worse anti-hero. Kyle Williams fumbled the ball twice in crucial kick return situations. He gave the ball back to the Giants and cost his tea the game. It was heartbreaking for him and for 49ers fans everywhere. It was his fault that the Giants won and people were really mad at him.</p>
<p><span id="more-5082"></span></p>
<p>Some people sent him <a href="http://blog.sfgate.com/49ers/2012/01/23/kyle-williams-receiving-death-threats-after-nfc-championship/">death threats.</a>. Others just said horrible things about him. One seven year old boy was also upset after seeing Williams give away the game.</p>
<p>He was crying &#8220;but&#8230; why&#8230; did&#8230; he have to fumble?!&#8221;</p>
<p>His father replied, &#8220;if you are so upset, how do you think he feels?&#8221;</p>
<p>To which the boy responded by asking if he could write a letter to Kyle Williams to &#8220;make him feel better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is what the kid wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Dear Mr. Williams:</em></p>
<p>We just watched the Playoff game. I feel really bad for you but I wanted to tell you that you had a great season. you sould be very proud, so I wanted to say thank you.</p>
<p>I am your #1 FAN!</p>
<p>Owen Shure<br />
Los Angeles, CA</p>
<p>p.s. your awsome</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>You gotta love this kid. But even more than the kid, I think you gotta love the father!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure he was upset too. Most people who invest time into sports are somewhat affected by wins and losses. All the more so a heart wrenching loss like the one suffered by the Niners on Sunday. This father used it as a great teaching moment for himself and his son. Athletes are people too. They make mistakes and it hurts them when they make mistakes.</p>
<p>The anger towards athletes when they don&#8217;t live up to our lofty expectations can cause people to do stupid things. They write death threats and forget that their sports heroes have feelings too.</p>
<p>No one feels worse than the goats of these big games. Hatred and anger towards them is immature and misguided.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rest of country has to deal with another championship that will be decided between teams from New York and Boston. That&#8217;s something to get upset about! (Just kidding.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes, the red-headed step child of the NBA is going to the Lakers.</p>
<p>There are folks who will be up in arms over a known &#8220;thug&#8221; joining their beloved Lakers.</p>
<p>The same Ron Artest who was suspended for one full year from participating in NBA games for his egregious actions when he was a young up and coming star with the Pacers.</p>
<p>As a Parent and as Rabbi you may want to know: What do I think?</p>
<p>If you <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/02/athletes-as-role-models/" target="_blank">read my blog</a> <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/29/obligatory-michael-jackson-post/" target="_blank">you should know</a> what I think.<span id="more-823"></span></p>
<p>To me, an athlete is judged on one thing and one thing only, their athletic ability.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/1998/weekly/980504/insidelook.html" target="_blank">how many illegitimate children they have</a>. I don&#8217;t care if they are nice people. I don&#8217;t care if they have good sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Those are the values that are my responsibility to teach my children. In fact, my son of 6 already knows that Artest is a thug. He also knows that kind of behavior is unacceptable. He also knows Artest is a great ball player and that has no impact on his character.</p>
<p>Now, if Artest&#8217;s behavior affects the performance of my team, then I start to care. But if he is a great teammate and contributes to the team, he is a good Laker.</p>
<p>Parents, DON&#8217;T LET YOUR CHILDREN IDOLIZE ATHLETES, THEY WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/03/11/does-jeff-mcgregor-learn-messilas-yesharim/" target="_blank">A few months back I hinted at a future post</a> about athletes and their role in our society as role models.</p>
<p>This past weekend I was reminded about my feelings on the subject. What I feel is what I believe to be the Torah approach but is of consequence and significance to anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>Over the weekend the NBA Conference Finals were settled. Something that happened after one team was eliminated has caused a media frenzy.<span id="more-735"></span></p>
<p>First, the Los Angeles Lakers advanced to the NBA finals for the 30th time in 61 years. (yay!) That is serious excellence right there. For the non-fans this means that during the games you will be able to drive the speed limit on the 405 because everyone else will be inside watching the game.</p>
<p>Then on Saturday night the impossible happened. LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers were eliminated by the Orlando Magic. Why is this the impossible? LeBron is a &#8220;godlike&#8221; figure and was expected to &#8220;redeem&#8221; his team and city by bringing them to the &#8220;promised land&#8221;. I am not kidding. Sportscenter on ESPN had a segment where a Minister from Cleveland said that Clevelanders were beginning to worship &#8220;The King&#8221;. LeBron is the most celebrated human being on the planet and is idolized around the world.</p>
<p>Anyway, the poor guy loses in 6 games to the Magic.</p>
<p>Ironically, this gives ABC Broadcasting which is owned by Disney a Walt Disney World (Orlando) vs. Disneyland (LA) Championship. Talk about jackpot!</p>
<p>The custom in all sports is for the losing team to shake the hands of the winning team and congratulate them upon winning. In fact according to Websters, this is the very definition of &#8220;Sportsmanship&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p><em><span>conduct (as fairness, respect for one&#8217;s opponent, and graciousness in winning or losing) becoming to one participating in a sport.</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p>The word has been around since <em>1745</em> and is preached universally to all athletes and competitors.</p>
<p>LeBron was so upset about losing to the Magic that <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2009/news/story?id=4218722" target="_blank">he left the court in a hurry</a> and did not congratulate the winning team. This is a big no-no.</p>
<p>In fact, he was so upset<em> </em>by the loss he also skipped out on the mandatory press conference.</p>
<p>That is bad sportsmanship. No question about it.</p>
<p>Do I care?</p>
<p><em>Absolutely not.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect better from an athlete. His excellence in Basketball has no bearing on his excellence in social skills, personal growth, intelligence, happiness or even sportsmanship. The only thing that he does that commands respect is his ball playing prowess. That is the only thing I look up to in this person.</p>
<p>Is he sending a bad message?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t turn to LeBron for messages on Sportsmanship. Nor do I turn to any athlete or celebrity for anything other than waht makes them unique or special.</p>
<p>As a parent it is my job to provide good role models for my children. I may need to be that role model at times. At other times it will teachers, Rabbis, family members or other people who command respect for their area of specialty. Athletes are not role models. Allowing an athlete to be the role model for your child is a failure in  your parenting.</p>
<p>Athletes may by chance turn out to be wonderful people whom we may respect for their abilities beyond sports, and that is great but it is not the norm. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/01/kobe-and-zehirus/" target="_blank">I myself have commented</a> on some athletes ability to prepare for their games and we can learn about preparation from them. However, expecting athletes to be role models is a terrible idea.</p>
<p>I think parents get lazy and expect their children to learn good values without taking the time or effort to teach those values. When the child gets nothing from his parents, athletes may fill that void. Ultimately they will all disappoint us.</p>
<p>Be a role model and don&#8217;t rely on superhuman athletes to do it for you.</p>
