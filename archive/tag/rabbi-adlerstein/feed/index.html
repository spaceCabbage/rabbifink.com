				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Limmud is a pluralistic Jewish organization that organizes learning conferences for Jewish people all over the world. Limmud London is a very large gathering and for the first time ever, it is being attended by the new Chief Rabbi of England, Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis. This has set off a controversy. Many charedi rabbis have prohibited their constituents from attending Limmud and are urging Rabbi Mirvis to renege on his commitment to attend. Â A very important discussion within the Orthodox Jewish community has ensued.<span id="more-7860"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/limmud.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7862" alt="limmud" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/limmud-600x356.png" /></a>Rabbi Nathan Lopes Cardozo defends the position of the Chief Rabbi in the Jerusalem Post. His argument is mostly that Limmud is a tremendous opportunity to showcase the beauty of Orthodox Judaism to the world and instead of taking that opportunity, they have handed it off to non-Orthodox Jews. Jonathan Rosenblum defends the charedi position in an article on Cross-Currents. His argument can be summarized as a reaffirmation that attending events with non-Orthodox Jews is the wrong forum for teaching Torah. He bases this on two assumptions. One is that Limmud is not serious about learning because they have too many fluffy sessions like &#8220;50 Shades of Hummus&#8221; and a drumming workshop. The second assumption is that something bad will happen if Orthodox rabbis attend a pluralistic event. He does not mention this in his article, but it is the underlying assumption here. Without making this assumption, his argument about the forum not be serious enough is flailing in a soft breeze.</p>
<p>Rabbi Adlerstein adeptly attacks this assumption in his latest article on Cross-Currents.</p>
<p>The assumption is not necessarily based on facts, evidence, or reason. It is based on a rabbinic proclamation issued 58 years ago and signed by Hall of Fame Orthodox rabbis from the bridge generation between Europe and America. This proclamation declared that it was prohibited by the Law of the Torah to be a member of an organization of Orthodox and non-Orthodox rabbis. In turn, this edict has been interpreted and expanded by the Orthodox Jewish establishment to include any joint learning or activity that may seem to give tacit approval to non-Orthodox movements.</p>
<p>As only he can, Rabbi Adlerstein softly and respectfully suggests that perhaps it is time to revisit this assumption. He makes two arguments. First, the reason for the proclamation in 5716 was to address Jews on the fence between Orthodox and non-Orthoodox Judaism. In his opinion, this is no longer a valid concern.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/17/we-are-going-in-the-wrong-direction/" target="_blank">I agree</a>. In fact, there is no more fence. Now we have a Grand Canyons between us. The soft center is nearly gone. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/07/09/my-appearance-with-rabbi-shafran-on-talkline-with-zev-brenner/" target="_blank">Rabbi Sacks lamented this in his controversial farewell address</a>. It&#8217;s true. So there is hardly a concern that we are going to lose the soft middle to non-Orthodox movements if we acknowledge they exist.</p>
<p>Second, Rabbi Adlerstein seems to be saying that working together need not imply approval, tacit or otherwise. We are absolutely capable of engaging in a discussion while acknowledging our irreconcilable differences. We do it all the time in real life. We don&#8217;t only talk to people with whom we agree on everything. Somehow it works.</p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/06/17/we-are-going-in-the-wrong-direction/" target="_blank">I agree with this as well</a>. Rabbi Shubert Spero made this argument in the 1960&#8242;s. He was correct back then and Rabbi Adlerstein is correct today.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that we can be a little more forceful that Rabbi Adlerstein. We actually have a responsibility to our shrinking non-Orthodox brethren to shine bright the light of passionate, compassionate, enlightening and enlightened Judaism. Non-Orthodox Judaism has kept many of our brothers and sisters in the fold. They are Jewish and religious in their own way thanks to Reform, Conservative, and the rest of them. For that we sincerely thank them. But many yearn for more. Not everyone that yearns for more will become Orthodox. Many of them would never attend a lecture that has Kiruv written all over it. But they will attend Limmud. They will attend other pluralistic events. That is our opportunity to inspire them.</p>
<p>There is no cost anymore. There is nothing to fear from showcasing our version of Judaism to more people, even if there is a drum circle 25 yards away. Nothing bad is going to happen. They are not the enemy. Our mutual enemy is leaving Judaism, God, and religion entirely. We are actually partners in that war. Let&#8217;s fight together.</p>
<p>The only reason we think something bad might happen is because we have a rabbinic edict telling us so.</p>
<p>But the truth is that the edict itself never prohibited a rabbi from speaking at Limmud or at a similar event. It merely prohibited membership to pluralistic organizations. We don&#8217;t need to violate the edict in order to participate! Why make the letter more broad than its words? It is shooting ourselves in the foot for no good reason. One can stay loyal to the Gedolim who signed the proclamation and speak at Limmud. They are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>We can debate the value of the rabbinic edict with regard to membership another time. Limmud is not membership. It is a speaking engagement. An amazing opportunity that I can only hope will inspire more rabbis to participate in a similar way in the future. We can pave the way for a time where all Jewish people can learn from one another. Yes, there are even some things that Orthodox Jews can learn from non-Orthodox Jews, despite Jonathan Rosenblum&#8217;s insistence to the contrary.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of unity. We can do great things together if we take a break from chasing demons from the last century.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><div id="attachment_5510" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Orthodox-articleLarge.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5510" title="Orthodox-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Orthodox-articleLarge-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo: NY Times</p></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s New York Times features a below the fold, front page article on sex abuse in the Hasidic community of New York. It&#8217;s usually not a good thing when orthodox Jews are on the front page of a newspaper, even below the fold. I am aware that this article reflects poorly on Hasidic Jews in particular and orthodox Jews in general. But I have to say that I found the article to be pretty fair overall and an excellent assessment of the situation.</p>
<p>Contra the article in the Forward, this article does not focus on DA Hynes (although it seems there will be an article about him tomorrow), the article in the NY Times focuses on the victims and the social pressure not to report incidents of abuse.</p>
<p>This is the real problem. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/25/in-defense-of-brooklyn-district-attorney-charles-hynes/">In Defense of Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes</a>)</p>
<p>The article tells the story of several victims and their families who did report the abuse to authorities only to find that they were shunned, excommunicated, or bought off. </p>
<p><span id="more-5509"></span></p>
<p>According to the article it goes all the way to the top. A family member of the Vizhnitz Rebbe in Monsey is alleged to have offered $20,000 to a victim&#8217;s family to drop charges. This is not some low level handler. This is not some shnook with a printer posting signs. This is the Grand Rebbe&#8217;s family. If that is how the leadership of thousands of Hasidic Jews handles abuse, what are we to expect from his followers?</p>
<p>Justice Guston L. Reichbach is a hero for standing up to the support of the community behind the accused and the lack of support for the victim. In court, he expressed deep disappointment with the community&#8217;s response in support of the abuser. He said there was a<em> &#8220;communal attitude that seeks to blame, indeed punish, victims.â</em> He also rebuked the multitude of Hasidic Jews in the courtroom standing in support of the abuser for writing letters in support of the defendant without a single word of <em>&#8220;any concern or any sympathy or even any acknowledgment for these young victims, which, frankly, I find shameful.â</em></p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>It was nice to see the workaround for <em>mesira</em> suggested by one rabbi, to tell a psychologist about the abuse and the psychologist will report it. This is completely unnecessary of course. See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/08/12/mesira-the-jewish-informant-in-halacha/">Mesira (The Jewish Informant) in Halacha</a></p>
<p>In addition to the text of the article, there are several very interesting documents attached. Take some time to read them. They are worth investigating.</p>
<p>Also, it is worth noting that there is no greater incidence of abuse in the ultra-orthodox community. There is just a much lower rate of reporting.</p>
<p>But the most difficult and heartbreaking part of the entire article was the quote from Rabbi Zweibel of the Agudah.</p>
<p>First of all, the Agudah has nothing to do with this. Hasidic groups could not care less what the Agudah says about sex abuse. So his quote is a non-sequitor. But he was asked his opinion and he reaffirmed with what we already know. His organization believes that a victim should go to a rabbi before going to the police. To be fair, the Agudah <em>expects </em>rabbis to be reasonable and advise bona fide victims to go to the police. However, there is little evidence that this will happen. I should also add that this is a step forward, believe it or not. It used to be that one was prohibited to go to the police at all, now one can go if a rabbi advises it. Baby steps.</p>
<p>But the worst part about what he said was this brusque comment: <em>&#8220;You can destroy a personâs life with a false report&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Absorb that for a moment.</p>
<p>The concern is that a false report could ruin someone&#8217;s life. I have two things to say about this. Both are very important.</p>
<p>First, this is built on a fallacious assumption. That is, that only rabbis have the ability to sniff out a false report and further that law enforcement is incapable of doing this task on their own. Both of this are horribly wrong. Rabbis are not trained to discern between true allegations, innuendo, and pure fabrication. Law enforcement professionals are trained to do that. They do it with regularity and with much success. Charges are not brought unless law enforcement is convinced that the abuse happened AND that it could be proved in a court of law. To say that rabbis are needed to protect innocent people who are falsely accused overstates their abilities and understates the reality.</p>
<p>But much, much, much more important is the implication of this policy. Victims of abuse have their entire lives ruined. One cannot overstate the effect of sexual abuse on a person. It haunts them every day of their life. Contemplating suicide is a normal response for a victim of abuse. It can become impossible for victims to function normally. Indeed, many victims have taken their own lives, unable to cope. Sex abuse kills. There are great rabbis who have held that an abuser is a <em>rodef</em>, a pursuer who is trying to kill someone, and anything and everything that can be done to stop them <em>must </em>be done. Sex abuse <em>destroys people&#8217;s lives.</em></p>
<p>I have <em>never </em>heard of someone who was falsely accused of a crime who committed suicide, who could not have a relationship with his or her spouse, who could not love, who could not trust, who could not cope with life. Is it an inconvenience? Absolutely. I  would not wish a false accusation on anybody. But to protect falsely accused people (which are a <em>very</em> rare occurrence) because it could ruin their life, when juxtaposed with the destruction caused by sex abuse comes off as so far removed from reality that it is scary.</p>
<p>To recap: Rabbis are not super-qualified to ascertain the truth of an accusation, law enforcement is qualified. False accusations are rare. When they occur they can harm a person&#8217;s life. To spare the falsely accused at the expense of victims is a heinous travesty of misplaced priorities. It is sick.</p>
<p>I want to end on a more positive note. My rabbis have all said that if one is a victim of abuse they <em>must </em>go to the police. These are ultra-orthodox rabbis. My point is that some rabbis get it. They were not the rabbis interviewed in the NY Times, but they are out there. <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/07/14/yadeinu-shafchu-es-hadam-hazeh/" target="_blank">As Rabbi Adlerstein wrote</a>, <em>&#8220;If your rov (rabbi) doesnât get it, think of getting a new rov.&#8221;</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/far_away.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5426" title="far_away" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/far_away-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Klal Perspectives is a great journal of articles written by orthodox Jewish rabbis and writers. The difference between Klal Perspectives and other journals is basically the content. KP is not a halacha journal. It is a practical journal.</p>
<p>The articles are not about well researched, fine nuances of Jewish law. The articles are about the issues that the orthodox community is facing and how to deal with them. Because the articles are not academic, they appeal to more people and more people are capable of writing articles for the journal. In a pleasing development, several articles have been authored by women. Lay-people are also featured as writers.</p>
<p>I loved the first issue in the fall. I was less impressed with the third issue in the winter. In the spring issue that was recently published the journal found its groove once again.</p>
<p>Each issue faces a specific topic or challenge. The authors are invited to respond with their best ideas and draw from their personal and professional experience.</p>
<p>I always enjoy Rabbi Adlerstein&#8217;s writing and his work in Klal Perspectives does not disappoint. But the best two articles of the three issues were written by one man. Both of his articles were incredibly insightful and innovative. That man is Moishe Bane.<span id="more-5425"></span></p>
<p>Perhaps one day we will revisit his first article. While the spring issue is still fresh I wanted to invite everyone to read his article in this issue. The challenge being discussed in the spring issue is in the words of Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zweibel: <em>&#8220;the increasing numbers from across the spectrum who feel no meaningful connection to Hashem, His Torah, or even His people.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Most of the article I read accepted this premise and thought of ideas that could be implemented by tinkering with the existing system and model. Moishe Bane did not do that.</p>
<p>His article basically rationalizes and almost justifies the skepticism and burnt-outedness of many orthodox Jews. But his solution is not to read more books, read different books, go to different classes, sing more, etc. et al. His ideas are to rebuild the orthodox Jewish community. His solution is a social one. And I could not agree more.</p>
<p>He encourages us to take pride on our community and to ensure that there is a community worthy of our pride:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Jewsâ identification with the observant Jewish community is sustainable only if the community is a source of pride. If community conduct and ethical standards are compromised, many will abandon their social allegiance, ultimately resulting in a theological abandonment, as well. These are the fundamental principles of chillul Hashem, and the implications are enormous. Ethical business practices, family harmony, and basic menchlichkeit must become hallmarks of being a frum Jew, as one would expect authentic Torah to mandate. If accomplished, frum Jews could then take pride in their community, and see the communityâs values as demarcations with which to identify.</em></p>
<p>Further, he implores us to interact socially. Do things together with other orthodox Jews. Have friends. Real friends:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There must be a renewed emphasis on deepening the basic social connections between members of the Orthodox community. The importance of friendships with others who share oneâs values must be emphasized and facilitated. Time spent with others within the community must be encouraged. It is critical that the expansive role that observant people play in their professional and business environments does not redefine them socially, as well. Connecting with G-d begins with connecting to Klal Yisrael, and these efforts must be forged through shuls, schools and other communal organizations. Attending shiurim or learning in chaburas often provide the needed camaraderie, as do chesed endeavors, but not all Jews have access to these opportunities. Ordinary social interaction, per se, among frum Jews must also play a critical role.Â </em></p>
<p>I would only add that part of the reason social interaction is so minimized and difficult is because of financial pressures and strain, large families, over-hyped tznius concerns, among other non-essential beliefs and practices. We can also attempt to treat the source of this malady and not simply treat the symptoms.</p>
<p>Please read the article. Comment on it here or anywhere if you have reactions and thoughts.</p>
<p>I intend to write my own response to this challenge. I think I have a different perspective than the other writers and my ideas about this subject are certainly not conventional. Hopefully I will be able to write it up soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.azure.org.il/index.php"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4957" title="3613078627_5f8765aac9" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/3613078627_5f8765aac9-201x300.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="300" /></a>On Cross-Currents, Rabbi Adlerstein recommends a recent article written by Dr. Moshe Koppel. Seeing as Rabbi Adlerstein rarely makes recommendations, I decided to see what the fuss was about.</p>
<p>The article is a 36 page masterpiece. Honestly, I think it is the best article I have ever read and I read a lot of articles, especially on Judaism.</p>
<p>Dr. Koppel proposes an elegant theory of how Judaism changes, Jewish law evolves and how that relates to many of our social issues today. He touches on insularity, the one-upmanship of piling stringencies upon stringencies, the necessity of belief and many other topics in this far ranging article.</p>
<p>I found myself agreeing with most of Dr. Koppel&#8217;s arguments and assertions. He builds a grand edifice from which the article could have made many different points. I found the final point that Dr. Koppel actually made in the article less compelling than the edifice from which the point was made. But I think there are several issues that I do find compelling that can be analyzed effectively using the tools provided in the article.<span id="more-4956"></span></p>
<p>Here are three very poignant items from the article that I think demonstrate the breadth and beauty of the article.</p>
<p>On the various versions of core beliefs that have developed over time for different segments of orthodox Judaism:</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>While for some, it may be enough to believe that Judaism has evolved helter-skelter from some special origins in the murky past, others might need to feel certain that every detail of Judaism such as it is today can be traced directly to an original revelation in a specific place at a specific time. While for some, it may be enough that the process is limping forward in some vaguely understood, positive direction, others might need the ultimate destination of the process to be specified in terms of concrete political events and/or miraculous interventions, and signs of the imminence and inevitability of such events to be already discernible. WhileÂ for some the satisfaction of leading a life bound to Torah is its own reward, others might need to be assured that the righteous reap rewards and the wicked suffer punishments in the most prosaic of ways, preferably instantly and in plain sight.</em></p>
<p>On acts that demonstrate that a person is associating with orthodox Judaism:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The effectiveness of signals can, however, vary with time and circumstance. In the world of American Orthodox Judaism, the refusal to eat non-kosher meat or Hostess Twinkies was once regarded as sufficiently onerous, due to the dearth of alternatives, that it could serve as an effective signal. But then the easy availability of kosher meat and snacks rendered such signals ineffective, because they were insufficiently costly. As a result, the old signals were replaced by new ones that were onerous enough to serve as signals. Kosher was replaced by glatt kosher, which was replaced by hasidishe shechita, yashon, hydroponic vegetables, and so on up the ladder of costliness and strictness. The easier each of these becomes to obtain, the less useful it is.Â </em></p>
<p>On the increased emphasis on the infallibility of the sages and demonization of the non-observant:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The need for the faithful to signal loyalty to ever-narrower splinter groups has led to increas- ing emphasis on precisely those aspects of tradition that are obscure and unnatural, while the lack of opportunity for constructive sacrifice has given rise to socially costly signaling. Like- wise, the need for the faithful to affirm an articulated narrative has become much greater, just as the specificity of the narrative has become more pronounced. Affirming the belief in the genius of the sages, the powers of the righteous, and the inevitable downfall of the wicked has become a litmus test of loyalty. Increasing monasticism and obscurantism have led to in- creasing defection. Each of these reactions has been triggered and exacerbated by the others and together they have constituted a vicious cycle, driving the community further and fur- ther away from a good equilibrium.Â </em></p>
<p>These examples are a mere taste of the amazing insight prevalent in the article.</p>
<p>I selected these sections as they support many of the ideas that I have written about on this blog. Much of our current &#8220;system&#8221; &#8211; if we can even call it that, is a result of social choices, consequences and needs. They are not specicically spiritual or halachic in nature. They evolved parallel to halacha but from a human perspective.</p>
<p>This does not mean that they are insignificant or that they are wrong. But it does mean that they need to be treated differently than halacha.</p>
<p>I think Dr. Koppel&#8217;s theory can be applied wonderfully to women rabbis and other contemporary issues facing orthodox Judaism today. In fact, I thought that is where he was going with the first 30 pages. Then he took a turn into an issue that I am as concerned with. But as I said above, the edifice is a platform for explaining and understanding many issues.</p>
<p>I hope you will take the time to read the article in its entirety and consider its message. It is long, but absolutely worthwhile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/disneyland-castle-at-christmas-edited-11_07_dl_5381_lowres.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4942" title="Sleeping Beauty Castle Snow Overlay" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/disneyland-castle-at-christmas-edited-11_07_dl_5381_lowres-300x189.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="189" /></a>It&#8217;s that time of year again. That time of year when everyone is supposed to be preparing for their respective holidays full of good cheer and spirits. What ends up happening is people tripping over themselves to be insulted or to make statements about their beliefs.</p>
<p>First, a bit of history. It might be that a lot of the grumbling comes from not understanding what this time of year really means for various people of various religions and faiths.</p>
<p>People have been celebrating holidays around the winter solstice for eons.</p>
<p>The Talmud makes the claim that Adam initiated the first winter solstice celebration. Having been created in the fall (Tishrei) and having sinned almost immediately upon his creation, Adam believed that he was being punished with less and less daylight. The day after the solstice he realized that such was the way of the world and the daylight period would be getting longer and longer. The next year he celebrated the 8 days preceding the solstice and the 8 days following the solstice as holidays. (BT Avodah Zara 8a).Â The Mishna which is being discussed in that Talmudic statement notes that there were several pagan holidays that were celebrated around the winter solstice during the Mishnaic era (circa 70-200 CE).</p>
<p>Clearly, there are very old sources that all orthodox Jews deem reliable indicating that this time of year was marked by celebrations. These celebrations predate Christmas and in the instance of Adam, predate Chanukah as well. Further, if the pagan celebrations noted in the Mishna were a few centuries old at the time, those holidays predate Chanukah as well. This is all according traditional, ancient Jewish sources.<span id="more-4941"></span></p>
<p>Although Christmas celebrates the birth of the Christian religion, it was not celebrated widely for the first 1000 years of Christianity. Slowly, through the middle ages the holiday gained prominence. About 300 years ago the holiday was already very popular with many Christians but some of the factions breaking off from mainstream Christianity at the time deemed it a pagan holiday and banned its celebration. The Puritans, famous for their establishing of colonies on American soil fined anyone who dared celebrate this holiday. The holiday is not found in scripture so it was presumed by them to have been borrowed from pagans and was impure.</p>
<p>Sometime in the 19th century Christmas became a universally accepted Christian holiday. The Christmas Tree was incorporated into the celebration as well. Later, in the 20th century, the imagery of Santa Claus, his elves, toy soldiers, gingerbread cookies and other familiar Christmas symbols made their way into the lore.</p>
<p>The holiday surged in popularity and then in the 21st century, non-Christians began to feel barraged by the overt religious overtones of the celebrations taking place on &#8220;neutral ground&#8221;. The ACLU, atheist groups and others began asking, sometimes demanding, that Christmas not be celebrated in public places.</p>
<p>Many Christmas celebrators took offense to this. Plenty of arguments have been invoked trying to establish a reason that Christmas celebrations should be allowed in public schools, municipal parks, government facilities, retail stores and pretty much anywhere and everywhere else. Jon Stewart and Bill O&#8217;Reilly have been going on about this for years and Rick Perry spurned an Internet meme with his opinion.</p>
<p>Rabbi Adlerstein on PatheosÂ and the LA Times have reported on the Santa Monica war over Christmas. For years, an elaborate Nativity scene decked the halls of a Santa Monica park. There are 21 spots for holiday displays. A number of groups entered a lottery to determine who would get the spots. Atheist groups won 14 of the spots, Jewish groups got three and the rest went to the Nativity.</p>
<p>The atheists are being pretty mean spirited about the whole thing. They are using this as a platform to poke fun and mock religious people. That&#8217;s not very nice. But I wonder how they would have responded if the displays had not been religious, i.e. The Nativity, and instead were the cultural symbols of Santa, peppermint candy and reindeer. Many of the Christmas displays are not signs of religion per se, rather a new-age version of a Christian holiday with winter symbolism that is not inherently religious.</p>
<p>Although, I don&#8217;t agree with Rabbi Adlerstein and many other religious Jews as well as Christians who want more Christmas displays. Last week I was at Disneyland with my family. The daily parade was holiday themed. Our younger son really, really wanted to see many of his favorite Disney characters who were not out and about during the day. We figured we would see them during the parade so even though we were not interested in the Christmasness of the parade we stayed to watch. He was thrilled and in that respect it was the right choice.</p>
<p>I watched the parade carefully. There was not one ounce of religion in the parade. Nothing that was particularly Christian or related to Jesus. There were reindeer, there were red hats, Santa and the Mrs. paraded on by, scenes from the Nutcracker, and other holiday stories were represented and there was a tree. But literally nothing in the parade was religious. Yet, we were all very uncomfortable. The symbols of Christmas have become part and parcel of the religious holiday despite not really being intrinsically related to the religious holiday. In other words, even though the parade was not religious, it offended our Jewish sensitivities. This was not our holiday. We were guests. It was uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Disney can do as it sees fit. But as a consumer I was disappointed. What is usually a highlight of the day was uncomfortable for everyone over the age of 3 because they chose to integrate a Christian holiday into a celebration of fun, magic and fantasy. It is unfortunate. And I can completely relate to the atheists who are offended by similar displays of holiday spirit and cheer even when stripped of their specifically religious elements.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t justify their over the top protest. Not at all. But I do believe that public religious and symbolic displays that are Christmas and Christian-centric are not inclusive and do not need to be tolerated anywhere and everywhere by the non-Christian public.</p>

For the benefit of the non-Facebookers and for the sake of having a more permanent record of my</p>
<p>When the San Francisco ban on circumcision was first proposed months ago I wrote two posts defending one&#8217;s right to circumcise their son. One was from a legal perspective: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/19/is-a-ban-on-circumcision-constitutional-probably-not/">Is a Ban on Circumcision Constitutional? Probably Not</a> and the other from a moral perspective:Â <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/11/22/circumcision-follow-up-or-why-circumcision-is-not-barbaric-for-orthodox-jews/">Circumcision Follow Up (or why circumcision is not barbaric for Orthodox Jews)</a>.</p>
<p>Since that time, I have had several conversations in the comments on my blog as well as other Internet forums with the proponents of the ban. These folks call themselves Intactivists and they are a voice that needs to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>As Rabbi Adlerstein wrote in <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/06/01/banning-mila-and-the-ascendance-of-china/" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Banning-Circumcision-The-Target-Is-Religion-Not-Jews-Yitzchok-Adlerstein-06-01-2011.html" target="_blank">places</a>, the battle against circumcision is in essence a battle against religion. I don&#8217;t agree with every word of Rabbi Adlerstein&#8217;s essays but the fact remains that the reason Intactivists exist is because they believe religion is a myth. They believe that following the precepts of the Torah, New Testament, Quran or any other religious text that claims to be the word of God is backwards and ridiculous. By extension, any religious practice based on the words of these religious texts is similar to taking instruction from a fairy tale.</p>
<p>I can understand that position. I vehemently disagree. But I can understand it.<span id="more-4318"></span></p>
<p>They reason that if the Torah is a fraud then following the Torah is silly. And if the Torah says to circumcise then circumcision is silly.</p>
<p>These people have the right to believe as they do.</p>
<p>They can even try to have the practice banned. A conversation will need to take place regarding the limits of governmental interference on a widespread religious practice. Medical data will be used but in reality be useless as the medical community takes no official position on the benefits or harms of circumcision. In the end, the likely result will hopefully be a better mutual understanding of the positions in this discussion and a legal conclusion.</p>
<p>I am happy to have the discussion with Intactivists. I believe a discussion benefits everyone.</p>
<p>However, a recent comic book seems to completely change the game.</p>
<p>A comic book called Foreskin Man has been published to promote the circumcision ban. The comic book is a propaganda piece that turns doctors and mohels into villains. The content is pure appeal to emotion. There is no logic, no discussion, no argument in favor of the ban. It is a good vs. evil story with the good cast as the Intactivists and the evil cast as those who circumcise. This would bad enough as far as propaganda goes.</p>
<p>But the comic book takes it a step further. Moving the conversation away from circumcision, the comic book taps into centuries of anti-Semitic propaganda using caricatures that haven&#8217;t been used since the Holocaust. Further, the comic book portrays the &#8220;good&#8221; side as blond, Aryan-looking and white. It looks like a KKK or Aryan Brotherhood comic book. The pictures are obscene and message to me is clear.</p>
<p>This is not about circumcision. This is not even about religion. This is about anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Those who know me can attest, I am the last person to assert anti-Semitism. I am an optimist and don&#8217;t believe that the non-Jewish public hates Jews. But this comic book is anti-Semitic. <em><a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/06/01/banning-mila-and-the-ascendance-of-china/" target="_blank">Res ipsa loquitur</a></em>.</p>
<p>The best case scenario for the Intactivists would be to claim that this comic book is NOT representative of their true views. It is one unhinged madman. That may be true, but until that is asserted or shown to be true, Foreskin Man casts the entire Intactivist operation under the shadow of anti-Semitism. Unless it can show otherwise, there is no longer any room for discussion. Once you use racial bias, epithetic imagery and ugly caricatures to make your point, you&#8217;ve lost the right to be a part of the conversation.</p>
<p>To be clear, I understand the Atheist&#8217;s position on circumcision. I welcome conversation about whether a circumcision ban is legal or moral or ethical or whatever. But the conversation is over until this disgusting anti-Semitic rhetoric ends and ends for good.</p>

It is a day designated to Holocaust Remembrance. In the spirit of this special day I would like to share a story with you.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/" target="_blank">Cross-Currents</a>, <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2010/04/09/the-song-was-true/" target="_blank">Rabbi Adlerstein has linked</a> to a very powerful article in the Detroit News.</p>
<p>Most Orthodox Jews have heard the song called &#8220;The Man From Vilna&#8221; by Abie Rottenberg. It tells a powerful story in post liberation Europe. <span id="more-2349"></span>It was the day of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simchat_Torah" target="_blank">Simchas Torah</a>, a grand celebration at the completion of the weekly Torah readings. Typically, the day is marked by feverish dancing and rejoicing for hours while holding the Sefer Torah Scroll. However, on this dark day the synagogue in Vilna had no Sefer Torah. They had been destroyed by the Nazis.</p>
<p>A Jewish Russian soldier spotted a young boy. This was an anomoly as most young children were killed in the holocaust. But this boy was hidden in a convent during the war and had survived. The soldier scooped up the boy and danced with the boy as if he were the Sefer Torah Scroll. His act symbolized to all that although the physical Torah Scrolls were destroyed and Six Million Jews had been killed, the Torah and Judaism live on through the next generation of children.</p>
<p>After that moment, they never saw each other again.</p>
<p>Until last week.</p>
<p>They finally met for the first time in 65 years. They both remembered that incredible day and that poignant moment all this time. It was a very emotional reunion.</p>
<p>Like many great stories, people thought of this as a legend, with perhaps some basis in reality. But these two men confirmed its veracity. It also identifies the two men as prominent Jewish leaders. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Foxman" target="_blank">Abe Foxman </a>was the boy and he is the New York based director of Anti-Defamation league and Leo Grossman, was the soldier and became the Rabbi of Shaarey Shamayim Synagogue in Oak Park Michigan. Their story and inspiration became inspiration for others as well as action in their lives for others.</p>
<p>I recommend reading the <a href="http://detnews.com/article/20100409/OPINION03/4090372" target="_blank">article in the Detroit News</a>.</p>
<p>Someone has taken the song and made a homemade music video. I have included the video below:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/knowledge-against-prison.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1983" title="jail prison" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/knowledge-against-prison-236x300.gif" alt="" width="132" height="168" /></a>Last semester at Law School I studied Criminal Law. Crime is ugly. It hurts the victims and negatively affects the criminal&#8217;s life forever. Families can be shattered and communities can be destroyed by crime.</p>
<p>The system we have today only looks at the criminal. The goal of our criminal justice system is to incapacitate criminals and punish them for their acts. Little systematic rehabilitation is offered to criminals and consequently there is a high rate of recidivism in our prisons. We hope that punishing criminals will deter them and future criminals from pursuing a life of crime. Unfortunately, crime persists and criminals continue to crop up.<span id="more-1982"></span></p>
<p>There is also research that shows that a criminal is hard wired psychologically with tendencies to commit crime as early as the age of five. It is very tough battle for the criminal justice system to fight when going head to head with ingrained psychological pathologies. It seems there is little hope for a system wide effort to change criminals into contributing members of society.</p>
<p>It is clear that our current system accomplishes one important goal. It maintains order. If not for the justice system chaos would rule the day as people with no care for right or wrong would be able to wreak havoc unfettered. The criminal justice system helps maintain order and some semblance of safety. It may not be a perfect system but in this regard it is the best we have.</p>
<p>While studying Criminal Law at Law School I also studied the <a href="http://www.lls.edu/programs/religiouslaw/adlerstein.html" target="_blank">Loyola Law School course on Jewish Law</a> withÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchok_Adlerstein" target="_blank">Rabbi Adlerstein</a>. The focus of the course was dual. On one hand we studied much of the substantive law on subjects such as helping Â distressed motorist, finding lost objects, justifiable homicide and abortion, criminal procedure and many other interesting topics in Jewish Law. On the other hand we learned about a system of rules designed to prevent crime and to create a more perfect society. When Jewish Law was THE law it effectively deterred criminals and focused on the criminal making the victims whole again as opposed to retribution of the criminal. This contrasts sharply with the criminal justice system in western society.</p>
<p>This semester I am hoping to be taking the Restorative Justice Seminar at Loyola with Professor Wood. (I say hoping because it depends on some administrative decisions that are out of my control.) The Restorative Justice concept is similar in some ways to the Jewish Law concept. It focuses on the totality of the crime, not just the criminal and it hopes to help rehabilitate criminals at least in some capacity. I am looking forward to learning more about Restorative Justice (hopefully).</p>
<p>All this discussion about crime and if there is a system that can deter crime is very important. We all want a more productive society. Less crime means less resources spent on deterring and punishing crime. More importantly it give more people the opportunity to be productive members of society. Perhaps most importantly, there are no hurt victims. Â Yet, much of it is theory as the system in place now is not changing dramatically any time soon.</p>
<p>However, I recently came across a self professed thief who changed his ways. This fellow stole thousands of dollars worth of various items for most of his life. This all began when he was about 5 years old. This is line with the research mentioned above. This fellow never got caught. He was never subject to the criminal justice system and yet, somehow, he turned it all around.</p>
<p>Can we learn from his story? Is there a system that can help criminals adjust their behavior? Does it require punishment?</p>

This leg of the race took place entirely in Prague, Czech Republic. As is customary on The Amazing Race, the roadblocks and detours along the way were part of the local culture.</p>
<p>One cannot speak of Prague without mentioning the great Maharal, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel" target="_blank">Rabbi Judah Loew</a>. And one cannot mention the Maharal without mentioning the famous Golem of Prague.</p>
<p>The racers were to cover a straw and wood golem with clay and bring the golem to the Old New Synagogue in Prague to receive their next clue. Check out this video for their instructions. (13 seconds is enough)<span id="more-1748"></span></p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="638" height="504" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/gMDbe5U7Rw0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="638" height="504" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/gMDbe5U7Rw0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Did you notice the way they describe a golem?</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Teams will delve into Prague lore and Jewish Mythology by building a golem, a figure made of straw and clay that was constructed to protect the Jewish Quarter in the 15th Century.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I would probably take offense to a miraculous biblical narrative being called mythology. Why? Because mythology implies that the story is fabricated. Colloquially, Mythology implies a false tale. Academics do not imply truth or falsity with regard to mythology, but lay people do. And The Amazing Race is not Academia. So, I would be offended if the Torah was called mythology in the colloquial sense.</p>
<p>But when the golem was branded mythology I did not even flinch. In fact, I only did flinch when the second part of the description of the golem came. When they said that a golem was constructed to protect the Jewish Quarter in the 15th Century, I was slightly offended.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because of an article that was brought to my attention by Rabbi Adlerstein.</p>
<p>Many people believe the Golem of Prague was a Kabbalistic Robot who was fashioned from mud by the Maharal to protect the Jews of Prague. Using Kabbalistic incantations and powers the Maharal is said to have created and then controlled the indestructible Golem, using the Golem as a weapon and a shield from hateful neighbors and government. There are stories told of the epic abilities and ultimately its demise.</p>
<p>But those who believe those stories have not read the article I was shown by Rabbi Adlerstein. The article ran around the 400th yartzeit (death anniversary) of the Maharal, when Rabbi Adlerstein (an expert in Maharal) was in Prague for the special proceedings in September 2009. The Jewish Action printed an excerpt of a scholarly look at the truth about the Maharal and the Golem of Prague.</p>
<p>The book rejects the notion that the Golem patrolled the streets of Prague in the 15ht Century showing that the story was likely fabricated in the late 18th Century and were adapted in the mid-19th Century into a book that has debunked and is now widely considered a hoax.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ou.org/index.php/jewish_action/article/57301/" target="_blank">The article is here.</a> (recommended reading &#8211; it is very short)</p>
<p>Therefore, the only offense I took to the description of the Golem on The Amazing Race was the assertion that there was an actual Golem. The myth has been debunked.</p>
<p>Is there still value in the story of the Golem of Prague? Sure. It is mythology. It has literary value. It is entertaining. It gives us a peek into mid-19th Century Europe, the place and time the stories were written. Perhaps most of all, it reminds us that we are naive, gullible and desperate for heroes in our lives.</p>
<p>That final message strikes me as important.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need mythological heroes. There are heroes all around us. There are so many people from whom we can learn and try to emulate. There are so many real stories of heroism and valiance, we don&#8217;t need mythology to be our hero.</p>
<p>Just keepin&#8217; it real&#8230;</p>
