				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On November 24, 2014, Sony Pictures was attacked by hackers. Attacked is the proper word to describe hacking in this context. The hackers intended to harm Sony financially and instill fear into the hearts of the studio’s executives and employees. Sites like Lifehacker make hacking sound like a cutesy hobby, but it is not cutesy. It is destructive and a form of terrorism.</p>
<p>The victims of the attack feel vulnerable, abused, and angry. Digital burglars stole their personal information and private data. That hurts. Victims deserve our empathy and kindness. The breach itself is enough to cause real pain and suffering, but that is only a small piece of the destruction the hackers have wrought.<span id="more-8991"></span></p>
<p>Every time someone reads a nugget of personal information or consumes media stolen by hackers, the knife is being plunged into their backs again, and again.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/12/04/the-proper-response-to-hacking/cyber-attack-hacker/" rel="attachment wp-att-8992"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8992" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cyber-attack-hacker.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="cyber-attack-hacker" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> The first blow is struck when hackers gain illicit access to private materials. It hurts to be violated. It also hurts that a few anonymous people know things that are supposed to be secret. Blame the hackers for the agony caused by their actual breach and the discomfort they caused by knowing things they should not know.</p>
<p>At that moment, publicly releasing all the confidential information and data has no further inherent negative consequence. That is to say, when hackers leak stolen information, the leak is not the thing that hurts. The thing that hurts is the public imbibing in the leak. If no one would care to taste the forbidden fruit the hackers are dangling in front of us, the victims would suffer no further harm. The leak hurts so much because far too many voyeurs gleefully devour the forbidden fruit. That’s on the voyeurs, not the hackers. That’s not kindness to victims of an attack.</p>
<p>It’s true that the hackers are the thieves. That’s evil. But the rest of us are “in possession of stolen property.” That’s also evil. We understand that viewing child pornography is immoral even though the viewer has not taken the photos or taken advantage of a child. But the demand for depraved images contributes to the market by giving the images value. If no one would look, fewer images would be produced.</p>
<p>Hacking is not the same as child pornography. But the personal violation is similar. No one granted us permission to view these divulged secrets. Hacking would be practically useless if we all agreed to embargo anything that is leaked by the hackers. But we don’t do that. Sadly, there is demand for hacked data. We drive the market. We glorify the hackers and get drunk on illicit access to intimate secrets. Suddenly, we are all Peeping Toms.</p>
<p><strong>I doubt we can figure out a way to stop hackers from hacking. I am hopeful that we can find a way not to look.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a lesson taught very early in the Bible. Upon witnessing the destruction of his world, Noah gets drunk and his sons discover him sprawled naked on the ground. One son stares. Two sons look away and cover their father’s shame. They are praised. The other is cursed. When we are confronted by the shame or nakedness or private information of others, there is only one moral choice. Gawking is a curse. Look away and cover their shame. That’s blessing. It’s what we would want others to do for us.</p>
<p>When hackers steal private information, it’s on us to ignore it. When hackers release pirated movies, it’s on us to go to the theater and pay to see the film. When hackers want to tell us secrets, it’s on us to ignore them. When hackers leak intimate photos of celebrities, it’s on society to look the other way and cover their shame. Our voyeurism is the fuel to the hackers’ fire. If we would just walk away, the fire would burn itself out. When we gawk, we are no longer innocent. We step across the moral line and we become the hackers.</p>
<p>Let’s neuter hacking. Don’t look. Avert your gaze. Respect privacy, especially betrayed privacy. Let’s make our society a place that refuses to drive the hacking market. Let’s care more about the victims of hacking than our prurient curiosity. Let’s not be voyeurs peering luridly into the figurative bedrooms of others as they suffer. Let’s knock on the door, offer our care and concern, and be their security blanket.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week we read Parshas Kedoshim. Some of the most well-known and important commandments are in this week&#8217;s reading. Kedoshim is one source that teaches us that we are prohibited from engaging in negative speech, commonly known as Lashon Hara.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I compiled a rudimentary list of fairly obvious ways that historical trends within Torah Judaism has either been heavily influenced or borrowed from its surrounding culture. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2014/03/26/torah-and-the-winds-of-change/" target="_blank">Torah and the Winds of Change</a>) In the weeks since, I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for more examples of this phenomenon. I thought of something very interesting during Pesach after seeing a Facebook post by the great Gideon Slifkin.<span id="more-8340"></span></p>
<p>This was his post:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a nice point and reinforces the importance of adhering to the real Torah position on reporting abuse, the one that holds that reporting abuse to the authorities is not Lashon Hara. Regardless, it made me think of the how Lashon Hara is emphasized more in the modern era than ever before. There is no authoritative text dedicated to the laws of proper speech that would serve as the precursor to the Chofetz Chaim. It&#8217;s the first of its kind. Subsequent to the publication and immense popularity of the book, Orthodox Jews have placed much value on the virtues of proper speech.<a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/0_99103_ffb3628f_XXL.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-8343" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/0_99103_ffb3628f_XXL.jpg?resize=484%2C381" alt="0_99103_ffb3628f_XXL" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I attended Ner Israel Mechina High School in Baltimore. The high school policy was to moderately discourage the students from studying mussar books in 9th and 10th grade. The reasons are not important, but I loved the policy. There were two exceptions to the rule, the commentary of the Vilna Gaon on Pirkei Avos and Chofetz Chaim. That&#8217;s how deep Chofetz Chaim has burrowed into the consciousness of our society. It&#8217;s one of two recommended volumes on character development for younger high school students.</p>
<p>That means there was a shift in values sometime in the mid to late 19th century. The Chofetz Chaim may have initiated this movement on his own through some intuition. He may have just done what he touhght was right and it happened to catch on. Or, he may have been riding a wave of change in his time and place that reflected similar values.</p>
<p>One of the greatest contributions to all of legal writing is the great article by Justice Brandeis and Justice S. Warren, &#8220;<a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html" target="_blank">The Right to Privacy</a>.&#8221; This article established an legally recognized expectation of privacy for all United States citizens. The article was published in 1890, just 17 years after the publication of Chofetz Chaim. Brandeis and Warren would not have written their article in 1830 or 1685 or 1328. Their article was a clear response to the challenges of their era.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Recent inventions and business methods call attention to the next step which must be taken for the protection of the person, and for securing to the individual what Judge Cooley calls the right &#8220;to be let alone.&#8221; Instantaneous photographs and newspaper enterprise have invaded the sacred precincts of private and domestic life; and numerous mechanical devices threaten to make good the prediction that &#8220;what is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed from the house-tops.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The popularity of newspapers and photography in the mid 19th century gave rise to a growing concern over privacy. People&#8217;s private business was being broadcast at an unprecedented pace and with an irreverence that clouded better judgment. It was a brave new world.</p>
<p>To address these new, modern concerns, &#8220;The Right to Privacy&#8221; was published in the Harvard Law Review. The authors conclude:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;In general, then, the matters of which the publication should be repressed may be described as those which concern the private life, habits, acts, and relations of an individual, and have no legitimate connection with his fitness for a public office which he seeks or for which he is suggested, or for any public or quasi public position which he seeks or for which he is suggested, and have no legitimate relation to or bearing upon any act done by him in a public or quasi public capacity.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This policy provided the first legal framework for curbing the publication of gossip and slander. It was their legal solution to a new social problem.</p>
<p>Parenthetically, the privacy concerns of 1890 sound familiar to us today, but they are hilariously out of proportion with modern privacy concerns. The law has not adequately addressed the current concerns, but I think that the laws of Lashon Hara are sufficiently pliable to give us a framework for dealing with the challenges of modernity.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s likely that the same social concerns that forced Justices Brandeis and Warren to pen &#8220;The Right of Privacy,&#8221; influenced Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagen to codify a comprehensive text on the laws of Lashon Hara. It wasn&#8217;t on a whim that he published Chofetz Chaim. It wasn&#8217;t an accident. The Chofetz Chaim was published to meet the demands of its time. The rise of the mass media caused the rise of concern over privacy. It also likely influenced Rabbi Kagen to take the initiative to write a book of Jewish Law and inspiration to meet those same concerns.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s impossible that &#8220;The Right to Privacy&#8221; inspired the publication of Chofetz Chaim because it was written 17 years later. It&#8217;s also nearly impossible that Justices Brandeis and Warren were influenced by Chofetz Chaim. Brandeis was a Jew, but it seems extremely unlikely that either of them read the book. Thus, the most reasonable explanation for both publications were common social concerns. The new information era demanded fresh ideas and a shift in perspective.</p>
<p>Thus, we have an additional example of the attitudes and values of the Torah lifestyle being influenced by outside factors. Prior to 1873, Lashon Hara did not have the exalted status that it has today. That is a shift in values. It&#8217;s possible this sight was completely shaped by internal concerns. But after seeing the same elements contributing to &#8220;The Right of Privacy,&#8221; I think Ockham would agree that his razor would suggest that both shifts in attitude were shaped by the challenges and milieu of the late 19th century.</p>
<p>As for us, the winds of change that brought Chofetz Chaim and vigilance over our speech to prominence are only more conspicuous in 2014. The laws of Lashon Hara apply now more than ever. In the digital era they are more relevant and vital than ever. Familiarize yourself with the laws. Be careful about what you say. And equally important, know when negative speech is not considered Lashon Hara so that we do not use it as a shield to protect the guilty and harm the innocent. Justice Brandeis was responsible for establishing the right to privacy, but he was equally known for coining the phrase &#8220;Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proper approach requires balance. Let us hope that we can all find that balance in our private lives, digital interactions, and meeting the challenges of dealing with predators and villains in our community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/life-preserver.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7244" alt="life-preserver" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/life-preserver.jpg?resize=300%2C225" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>I don’t think it matters much what Jewish law would say about the government snooping on its citizens. The government is not subject to Jewish law and its citizens don’t expect the government to conform its policies to Jewish law. Yet, there seems to be value in such analysis as I have been asked this question by several people.</p>
<p>As is often the case, we have two competing interests at stake. Privacy on one hand and safety on the other. Both of these interests are recognized in Jewish law. But they are completely different planes.</p>
<p>Life is primary in Jewish law. All else comes after life. One is not permitted to kill. One is not permitted to commit suicide. One is not permitted to harm one self. One is not permitted to place one’s life in danger. One is obligated to violate Jewish law in order to save one’s own life (with three exceptions &#8211; murder, idolatry, and adultery). The sanctity of life is of the utmost importance in Jewish law. These particular laws are derived from primary sources in the Torah and Mishna.<span id="more-7243"></span></p>
<p>There is also a prohibition against snooping on one’s neighbor in Jewish law. One is not permitted to place a window overlooking one’s neighbor’s private property. This sort of loss of privacy gives rise to a civil action in Jewish court. Some authorties extend right of privacy to include eavesdropping or even accidentally hearing others in private conversation.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is standing prohibtion in Jewish law against sharing anything revealed in private conversation. Without specifically stating that a conversation is allowed to be shared, it is required to be kept in confidence.</p>
<p>Finally, much later on in Jewish legal history a ban was placed on reading the private communications of others. This decree originally applied to mail but many authorities now extend it to all forms of communication.</p>
<p>These considerations all apply today and would apply to governments as well.</p>
<p>However, none of these considerations overrides the sanctity of life. If just one life could be saved it seems that all these rules could be ignored. Certainly, it would be expected that the minimal intrusion to save the life would be made. Saving a life is not a license to do as one pleases. Further, use of the information gathered would be limited to the purpose of saving lives and nothing else.The interesting thing here is that one life is enough for all our privacy to be suspended. One life is all it takes.</p>
<p>It would seem that as long as lives are being saved, the government is not bound by the strict privacy laws or decrees. The question then becomes whether lives are actually being saved. I don’t know the answer to that question. But that is the issue. It is the only issue.If there is a threat of loss of life, the government or any private citizen would have the right and according to some authorities the obligation to spy on its citizens to protect others.</p>
<p>I think it is laudible that the government takes the lives of its citizens so seriously. Obviously there are concerns that the government will use the information obtained improperly. However, there can be no prohibition against the gathering of the information so long as lives are at stake.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Spy_Vs__Spy_by_SkippyWoodFood.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6121" title="Spy_Vs__Spy_by_SkippyWoodFood" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Spy_Vs__Spy_by_SkippyWoodFood.png?resize=300%2C182" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that effectively allows the government to wiretap anyone they choose without fear of repercussion. In its ruling, the court stated that while a warrant-less wiretap was not valid, the victims of the wiretap could not sue for damages because of sovereign immunity (protection from suit for the government). This reversed a ruling in the District Court that awarded damages to two victims of an illegal wiretap.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the case were suspected of involvement with Al Qaeda. The government surveilled them without obtaining a warrant. They found out about it in the NY Times and sued. As it stands now, the government cannot be sued for this breach of Constitutional law.<span id="more-6119"></span></p>
<p>It seems that the primary issue in this case on appeal was whether the language of the statute that prohibits unlawful surveillance constituted an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity. In its ruling, the Court of Appeals held that it did not. As support for their ruling, the court added that the legislature rejected a section in the law that would have waived sovereign immunity thus proving that it was left out intentionally.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs could sue for damages if the information is used. However they cannot sue for damages simply because the information was collected.</p>
<p>So we are left with a law with very few teeth. While the government is not permitted to spy on us, the government will suffer no harm for doing so unless it uses the unlawfully obtained information. This is easy to avoid, because once the wiretap provides enough information, the government can discover new information lawfully and rely on that new information for prosecutorial purposes.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs were spied upon under a Bush administration spy program. It seems we are now stuck with this law and its arcane ramifications.</p>
<p>It should not concern us that the victims of this illegal wiretap were Al Qaeda suspects. They were American citizens just like the rest of us. Any one of us can be a victim of similar illegal government action.</p>
<p>If Congress feels that the law yields a bad result they can amend the legislation to waive sovereign immunity. As citizens, we can petition our representatives in D.C. to do that. They don&#8217;t have to listen, but it looks like that is our best shot at protected ourselves from being spied upon by the government.</p>
<p>It is not the court&#8217;s job to fix the law. That is the job of the legislature. Let&#8217;s hope they fix it soon.</p>
