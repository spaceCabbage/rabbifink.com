				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Israel, a haredi woman named Ruth Colian is asking that the Israeli government stop funding haredi political parties because they discriminate against women. The haredi parties will not place a woman on their ballots, yet they are receiving money from the government. Colian argues that the government is sponsoring gender discrimination by supporting the patriarchal system of haredi Judaism in politics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a good argument and I hope she wins. But that&#8217;s not the issue here.<span id="more-7733"></span></p>
<p>The real issue is that Colian is running as a haredi woman for political office. She won&#8217;t run on a secular list because she says she is haredi. She wants to break the glass ceiling in the haredi community. I wish her luck because it won&#8217;t be easy. In the past, people who tried to change haredi norms were either pushed out or left on their own accord. It&#8217;s an uncomfortable place to be a revolutionary but maybe Colian will be the one.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7735" alt="feminism2" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/feminism2-510x600.jpg" /></p>
<p>If she is successful, it will mean yet another avenue that haredi women can achieve the same level of acclaim and success as men. Leaving the rabbinate as one of the few places haredi women cannot. That might prove to be a difficult position to maintain.</p>
<p>Corian is a true haredi feminist. She is haredi and she is vying for equal opportunities for women. This is the basic premise of feminism. It comes in many flavors and textures, but at the heart of all of these feminist movements is a sense that men and women should have equal opportunities and that men should not dictate the role that women must play in society. One can see how feminism and haredi life seem incompatible. While it&#8217;s true that many, if not most, haredi women choose to play the dignified and refined role of mother, wife, and homemaker on the sidelines of religious and communal life, there are many women who would prefer to have a choice to play a more public role in religious and communal life. That is what the haredi feminists want.</p>
<p>When juxtaposed with a trailer for an upcoming documentary on the hasidic community of Brooklyn called Uniforms: The Hasidic #Community, Corian&#8217;s struggle seems even more poignant. The documentary was produced by a self proclaimed non-traditional Jewish woman. She offers a peek into the softer, more spiritual side of Hasidic Judaism. It&#8217;s a noble attempt to show good people living good lives. The public has a negative perception of Hasidic Judaism and this documentary could go a long way to bridging that divide.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the extremely problematic conflation of different hasidic groups in the movie, illustrated by the visuals of chasidim in shtreimels and double head coverings for the women, while hip Chabad people talk about their more liberal way of life, there was a line in the trailer that requires attention.</p>
<p>A woman, who almost certainly is Chabad as betrayed by her perfectly unaccented English, proclaims: <em>&#8220;Jewish [sic] women, we&#8217;re kind of the biggest feminist women out there. Judaism creates space for women to tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>I think that if a woman wants to &#8220;tap into what might not be popular right now, but what is innate, the creative power of bearing children&#8221; she should have that opportunity. I am all for traditional values for women that want those values in their lives. It&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s one of the secrets to Orthodox Judaism. In fact, I think it&#8217;s a problem that so many husbands and fathers are studying all day while their wives are leaving the home to support their husbands and babies are being dropped off at day care. I believe the traditional home is a great ideal and bearing children is a wonderful and powerful role to play in this world.</p>
<p>However, it is decidedly not feminist. It can be feminist to choose that life. But if everyone is doing it, or is expected to do it, it does not fit any accepted meaning of the word. You can&#8217;t unilaterally change the entire meaning of the word feminist and apply it to haredi Judaism. It doesn&#8217;t pass the laugh test, forget the smell test.</p>
<p>And why is feminism an ideal for this haredi woman? Why is she trying to pretend that a world where women are not given every opportunity that men are given and they are expected to produce large families is feminist. It&#8217;s not feminist at all. Proudly so! Recently, I heard a prominent rabbi say that Jewish feminists were comparable to reform and conservative Judaism! Orthodox Judaism is not feminist. You need to be okay with that to be orthodox.</p>
<p>In Israel, Ruth Corian is dying for the opportunity to lead her community. She is a feminist. In Brooklyn the party line is apparently that being a mom is the most feminist thing one can do.</p>
<p>Again, I am not degrading moms. God forbid! I think it&#8217;s a great choice if one can and one wants to make it. But it&#8217;s not feminist if that is what is expected. But even more perplexing is why are you trying to call it feminist?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is an isolated incident. I&#8217;ve seen this more and more often. People are selling Orthodox Judaism as feminist. I&#8217;m a pretty liberal Orthodox Jew and I don&#8217;t see how anyone could interpret my religion as feminist.</p>
<p>Personally, it bothers me. I grapple with it. I struggle with the current inequality and I empathize with those orthodox Jewish women who want to play a more prominent public role. I wish Orthodox Judaism had more feminist opportunities. I do my best to accommodate feminism within tradition. But I don&#8217;t redefine the term to conform to my orthodox worldview. Words have meaning and that meaning must be respected.</p>
<p>It seems impossible, if not extremely unlikely, that orthodox Judaism will ever have equal opportunities for men and women. Maybe that&#8217;s okay. Not every religion or creed has to conform with every modern sensibility. But let&#8217;s at least be honest about it. And if we can, try to break as many glass ceilings that we can shatter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6777" alt="Choices" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Choices-300x239.jpeg" width="300" height="239" />The Forward deserves a lot of credit for publishing a <a href="http://forward.com/articles/172778/a-mother-is-who-i-am/?p=all" target="_blank">very nice article written by Rachel Freier</a> about the joys of Hasidic motherhood. Unlike Judy Brown, Freier is still part of the Hasidic community and she argues that being a <em>yiddishe momme</em><em> </em>is who she is. It defines her. She argues that the pressure and value placed on having children in the Hasidic community is vital and a beautiful part of her lifestyle. It is what makes her life worth living.</p>
<p>Freier is an attorney. I don&#8217;t know for sure, but I think she might be the only Hasidic woman who is a lawyer <em>(NOT INCLUDING LUBAVITCH).</em> As an orthodox Jew, I am very proud of women like Rachel Freier. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/" target="_blank">With all the talk of whether women can &#8220;have it all&#8221;</a>, she is a example of someone who does have it all. She has a family &#8211; 6 kids. She has a career &#8211; a law practice. She has religion &#8211; Hasidic Judaism. She has it all. As a role model, I think she is an excellent person for orthodox Jewish women to emulate.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also inspiring to see someone who has it all, coming back to their role as a parent, and in her case as a mother as the thing she values most and as the part of her life that defines her. I cannot say it with any more conviction &#8211; More Rachel Freiers please!</p>
<p>But, and you just had to know there was a &#8220;but&#8221; coming, I don&#8217;t entirely agree with her approach.<span id="more-6776"></span></p>
<p>I think Freier makes a mistake that a lot of women with traditional values make. They think that feminism or modern gender roles seeks to eliminate the traditional homemaker or <em>yiddishe momme</em> from society. Therefore, they will argue that there is a lot of value and beauty in traditional roles where women are mostly mothers and wives.</p>
<p>But that argument is not a counter argument to feminism. It is not a counter argument to the Deborah Feldmans and Judy Browns of the world. All they are arguing is that women should have a <em>choice</em>. If a young woman wants to marry after a couple dates, great. If a woman want to have children right away, great. If a woman wants to have a large family, great. But what if they don&#8217;t? Should they be pressured? Should they be forced? Should they feel like they must do what they don&#8217;t want to do?</p>
<p>Brown, Feldman, feminists, etc. want women to have choices. Freier is happy with her life. That&#8217;s great. Really. I hope many women can follow in her footsteps. I am happy for her and for the thousands and thousands of women who chose motherhood, or even if they merely accepted motherhood, but did so with exuberance and gusto. But there are too many women (and men too) who would like to have options.</p>
<p>By limiting options, traditionalists are implying that with a choice, too many would opt out. That doesn&#8217;t make for a very compelling case to opt in. So what I suggest strong, successful, more traditional women in the Hasidic and non-Hasidic communities do, is join the voice of the progressives who want women to have that choice and then and only then make their case for traditionalism. Don&#8217;t make the case for traditionalism and hope to head off anyone from rejecting it. Give our daughters every option available to them and guide them, teach them what values you think are important. If they buy in, great. If not, they will be productive, happy, contributing members of society in other ways. They may have but a few children instead of half a dozen or more. Or they may postpone motherhood for a few years. Let them. Please.</p>
<p>Rachel Freier had options. She is a lawyer. Clearly, she has excellent command of the English language. But far too many of the young women in her community are deprived of the tools that would enable them to have a choice and they march in lockstep to a sit in date at 17, the bridal canopy at 18, and the maternity ward at 19, and at 21, and at 23, and so on.</p>
<p>I know that Freier does not appreciate this point because of her law school anecdote. She took a brave stance in her law school classroom discussion on abortion and argued that abortion should not be legal because <em>&#8220;having children is a blessing and each day that I gave birth was the most memorable day of my life. The joy of motherhood cannot be properly described in a law school casebook.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great argument in favor of someone <em>electing</em> not to abort a pregnancy. It is <em>not</em> a valid argument against giving women a choice about aborting a pregnancy. I am not arguing that abortion is good, bad, or otherwise. There are perhaps very good arguments to ban abortion. The joy of motherhood is not a valid argument when the potential mother does not want that joy or maybe she doesn&#8217;t even feel it. This anecdote shows that Freier misses the point on the choice to have an abortion and on the march to motherhood. Women should have choices, so long as they are moral and justifiable in one&#8217;s legal and ethical code. There is nothing in halachic Judaism that should prevent a young woman from having a choice.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget, that there are many women in the Hasidic community who would never let their daughters attend law school. Would Ms. Freier not argue that even Hasidic women should have that option?</p>
<p>We love our <em>yiddishe mommes. </em>They play a very important role in the future of our people. We want our <i>yiddishe mommes</i> to want to be <em>yiddishe mommes</em> and embrace that role. But it&#8217;s only one role. It need not be the only role.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Vatican.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5410" title="Vatican" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Vatican-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a>It is foolish for orthodox Jews to ignore the recent spat between the Vatican and the Leadership Conference of Women Religious. Their dispute rises from a recent ruling issued by the Vatican that calls for the reigning in of a group of U.S. nuns who have challenged some of the doctrines of the Catholic Church. Their approach is being called radically feminist and the Vatican is appointing a bishop to oversee the LCWR.</p>
<p>The radical feminism of the LCWR basically amounts to their challenging the Vatican on two issues. The first, the issue of female clergy. Women are still precluded from positions of authority in the Catholic Church. The LCWR has challenged this position in the hope that the Vatican would consider allowing women into the hierarchy of its leadership. The Vatican has not taken to this kindly. The second area that the radical feminists have defied their leadership is on the issue of contraception. The LCWR supports the American Healthcare Act&#8217;s requirement that employers provide birth control to employees. The Vatican opposes this greatly. You can see why they are upset.<span id="more-5409"></span></p>
<p>Besides stirring controversy, the LCWR is a powerful charity and social service group. They provide help and support to many needy people. Their feminist positions are only a tiny speck of what they do.</p>
<p>Why is it foolish for orthodox Jews to ignore this story? Because the same exact issues are brewing and bubbling beneath the surface in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>On the far left of orthodox Judaism, women are asking for and being granted greater communal roles. In the center of orthodox Judaism, women are more involved in communal affairs than ever before. On the far right of orthodox Judaism, women are basically in the same position they were in 100 years ago. But the premises are being challenged. Some women want more. Some communities want more for and from their wives and daughters. The Vatican has held fast and strong to the prohibition against female clergy. The orthodox Jewish establishment has done the same. The next decade will be very interesting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, birth control is also becoming more and more of an issue. Orthodox Judaism never held the same way as the Vatican with regard to contraception. But recently, the leadership aligned itself with fundamentalist Christians in the American Healthcare Act debate. The motives behind this are unclear. Either it was a political move or a slippery slope argument or it was a doctrinal decision that held contraception to be prohibited. We don&#8217;t know and it doesn&#8217;t really matter.</p>
<p>What does matter is the stories and rumblings that I hear from women and their husbands about their birth control issues. This will get a full post of its own eventually, but suffice to say that this is already a major issue for orthodox women and their husbands and its prominence will only increase over the next few years.</p>
<p>So while we don&#8217;t have a Vatican, nor do we have a LCWR, we do have some of the same challenges of modernity that the Catholic Church is facing. Historically we have been ahead of them in adapting. In recent years our power of adaptation has dwindled. These two issues will challenge us to adapt or circle the wagons. Let&#8217;s hope we make the right choice.</p>

The last three blog posts I have attempted to write have been all on the same topic. I have decided to turn them into two blog posts and this is the first of a two part series.</p>
<p>The topic is parenting. The relationship between parents and their children.</p>
<p>It is a timely subject as the Jewish Calendar turns the page into a new year. A major element of the Rosh Hashana liturgy is the relationship between us and God. That relationship takes a few forms. One form is that of a parent to a child.</p>
<p><span id="more-1183"></span></p>
<p>On Sunday, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/usopen09/news/story?id=4471433" target="_blank">Kim Clijsters won the US Open</a>. The US Open is a Tennis Tournament featuring the greatest players in the world. Clijsters was a dominant tennis player a few years ago and then she took a break to have a baby. She had the baby and two and a half years later came back to competitive tennis. Her first major tournament in her comeback was the US Open. And she won.</p>
<p>What struck me is the media&#8217;s attention to the fact that she was a mother and yet somehow was able beat the odds and win the US Open. I think that is noteworthy because parents have different priorities than non-parents. Parents put their kids first and their lives second. That Clijsters could be a mother whose primary concern was her child and still had enough in the tank to train and compete and win is very impressive.</p>
<p>Clijsters demonstrated the true strength of being a woman. She demonstrated the ability to have her cake and eat it too. Clijsters is at the top of her professional world and is also a relatively new mother. Congratulations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I just can&#8217;t help but wonder how all this affects her child.</p>
<p>Is there a cost? Does her child miss her mother when she spends long hours training? Should a mother of a young child be spending more time with her child?</p>
<p>I think it is great that women have opportunities for success. I really do.</p>
<p>But what about the child? What if the father is also working a tough, time consuming job?</p>
<p>Who raises the children?</p>
<p>I know that this question is broader than Kim Clijsters winning the US Open. But the media attention surroounding her success and motherhood got me thinking.</p>
<p>What is the feminist approach to this issue? How are parenting duties divided when both parents work? Does it even matter? Or are children just as well off being raised by paid surrogates?</p>
