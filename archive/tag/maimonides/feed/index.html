				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week&#8217;s Torah portion outlines many of the laws and precepts regarding Kashrut. Specifically, which animals are fit to eat and which animals are prohibited to be eaten. Kashrut is also the subject of one of the more common conversations between a Kashrut observant Jew and anyone else. That conversation goes something like this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Taste this [non-kosher food].&#8221;<br />
&#8220;No thanks.&#8221;<span id="more-9168"></span><br />
&#8220;You sure? It&#8217;s really good.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ya, really, I&#8217;ll pass.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Just try it!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s not kosher.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Kosher?! You keep kosher!? But you seem so normal!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ya, I keep kosher.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But isn&#8217;t that an archaic law that was about being healthy and staying clean in the desert? Nowadays, we know that pig is safe to eat and shellfish are safe to eat. Why would you keep kosher in 2015?!&#8221;</p>
<p>At this point,<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2015/04/17/why-do-we-keep-kosher/attachment/1024/" rel="attachment wp-att-9169"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9169" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1024.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> just about every Kashrut observant Jew will almost always say the exact same thing:</p>
<p>&#8220;Kashrut has nothing to do with health! That&#8217;s a myth created by people who just don&#8217;t want to eat kosher! Kashrut is about [insert something spiritual or religious or whatever]. Only super liberal Jews and secular Jews think it is about health!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds familiar, right?</p>
<p>The thing is, this is a lie. Sure, there are plenty of reasons one can propose or concoct for keeping kosher. For some people it is discipline, for others it is mindfulness, for others it is spiritual health, and there are many other reasons.</p>
<p>Maimonides says in the Guide (<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp184.htm" target="_blank">3:48</a>, Friedlander Tr):</p>
<p><em>I maintain that the food which is forbidden by the Law is unwholesome. There is nothing among the forbidden kinds of food whose injurious character is doubted, except pork (Lev. xi. 7), and fat (ibid. vii. 23). But also in these cases the doubt is not justified. For pork contains more moisture than necessary [for human food], and too much of superfluous matter. The principal reason why the Law forbids swine&#8217;s flesh is to be found in the circumstance that its habits and its food are very dirty and loathsome. It has already been pointed out how emphatically the Law enjoins the removal of the sight of loathsome objects, even in the field and in the camp; how much more objectionable is such a sight in towns. But if it were allowed to eat swine&#8217;s flesh, the streets and houses would be more dirty than any cesspool, as may be seen at present in the country of the Franks. A saying of our Sages declares: &#8220;The mouth of a swine is as dirty as dung itself&#8221; (B. T. Ber. 25a).</em></p>
<p><em>The fat of the intestines makes us full, interrupts our digestion, and produces cold and thick blood; it is more fit for fuel [than for human food].</em></p>
<p><em>Blood (Lev. xvii. 12), and nebelah, i.e., the flesh of an animal that died of itself (Deut. xiv. 21), are indigestible, and injurious as food; Trefah, an animal in a diseased state (Exod. xxii. 30), is on the way of becoming a nebelah.</em></p>
<p><em>The characteristics given in the Law (Lev. xi., and Deut. xiv.) of the permitted animals, viz., chewing the cud and divided hoofs for cattle, and fins and scales for fish, are in themselves neither the cause of the permission when they are present, nor of the prohibition when they are absent; but merely signs by which the recommended species of animals can be discerned from those that are forbidden.</em></p>
<p>Clearly, Maimonides held that kashrut laws were about health, and he wasn&#8217;t a secular Jew.</p>
<p>What are we to make of this?</p>
<p>The reasons for commandments are flexible. They change with time, place, medical and scientific advances, and personality. This is unavoidable for many reasons. This is a good thing. The laws are firm and cannot be changed, but the social benefits and ideas they are able to teach us change all the time. We can seek &#8211; we should seek! &#8211; and discover the meaning that subjectively resonates with us and we cannot impose subjective meaning on others.</p>
<p>There are no objective reasons for Torah commandments. There is only subjective speculation. These ideas can only enhance our observance of God&#8217;s word and they cannot be a reason to undermine or violate God&#8217;s word. We have to do it, but we can do it for the reason that works for us.</p>
<p>Kashrut is a huge part of observant Judaism today. It can mean so many different things to different people. It is extremely unlikely that kosher food is part of an undiscovered secret healthy diet and the rest of the world is consuming deadly foods every day. Aside from having no scientific or medical basis dietarily speaking, there is just no way anyone would believe that Jews possess any gastronomic advantage over anyone, especially Ashkenazi Jews.</p>
<p>You want to know why people keep kosher? Ask them. Ask yourself. Research the issue and find something that makes sense for you. Not only is there nothing wrong with that, I think that is what we are supposed to do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contemporary Orthodox Judaism has the benefit of access to thousands of Torah commentaries at the click of a button. This has resulted in dozens of books that cull from these sources providing a multifaceted view of the text of the Chumash. Previously, the popular Midrashim such as those found in Rashi or the Ramban were most well known and accepted as baseline interpretations. I think in the last 150 years or so we have seen greater exposure to the other midrashic interpretations because they are more accessible and more people are studying Torah.<span id="more-7729"></span></p>
<p>The result is that some commentaries grapple with competing opinions in the Midrashic literature. It&#8217;s en vogue to say that Midrashim do not need to reconcile. I agree. There is no reason for all Midrashim to jive. They are independent interpretations and I don&#8217;t believe it is necessary to take each interpretation as literal or historical fact. This approach has ancient roots and is not apologetics. Maimonides famously said that Midrashim that contradict observable fact are not to be taken literally.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7730" alt="download" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/download.jpeg?w=980" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>However, as far as I know (and I could be totally mistaken) he doesn&#8217;t say what to do about conflicting Midrashim. Of course it stands to reason that if Midrashim are not to be taken literally then they can conflict. But he doesn&#8217;t specifically tell us what to do about conflicting Midrashim.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, almost everyone else seemed to think conflicting Midrashim were a problem. Many commentaries try to reconcile Midrashim. It&#8217;s a staple of the Achronim. Apparently they thought that Midrashim <em>did</em> need to be reconciled.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah asks questions on Midrashic interpretations under the assumption that they must work together. For example, he asks how Ishmael could be a Tzadik as per Rashi when the verse says &#8220;<em>ba&#8217;asher hu sham</em>&#8221; and also have committed one of the three cardinal sins to get tossed out of the house of Abraham. The easy answer is that it&#8217;s not a question because Midrashim don&#8217;t have to reconcile. (Or maybe he did Teshuva.) But the Torah Temimah does not answer it that way. Instead he attempts to show that there were two competing theories in Chazal and there are two ways to learn the reason Ishmael was kicked out and the one that says he was a Tzadik argues on the one who says Ishmael committed a cardinal sin. They are forced to say he was actually not a Tzadik and they will interpret the verse &#8220;<em>ba&#8217;asher hu sham</em>&#8221; like Nachmanides (contrary to Rashi). He does this all the time.</p>
<p>It seems, that in the view of the Torah Temimah, it is preferable that Midrashim reconcile unless there is a valid competing view. So while Midrashim in direct conflict seems to be okay without explanation, one standalone Midrashic interpretation must conform to all other standalone Midrashim. If there is an existing explicit conflict then you can say that a standalone irreconcilable Midrash follows one of those two or three options.</p>
<p>In other words, if we have Midrash A about 1 and Midrash X about 2 they are expected to conform. If they cannot conform we look for Midrash Y about 2 and see if that will work for Midrash 1 about A. If even that won&#8217;t help then we can say Midrashim can conflict. But there is a clear preference for unity amongst Midrsahic interpretations. This is even more pronounced when the authors of a Midrash are bold faced names that are normally authoritative.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the point here? The point is that while it may be convenient to simply answer that Midrashim can conflict, there is an authentic Jewish tradition that tries to reconcile Midrashim and we should first see if we can harmonize Midrashim before we simply dismiss any question on a Midrashic interpretation by saying that they can conflict without batting an eye.</p>
<p>Like most people, my views on this issue evolve and this was a bit of an epiphany for me. If it was always obvious to you, <em>ashrecha.</em></p>

<p>Turns out, I made a big mistake and misremembered what the Torah Temimah said. It&#8217;s inexcusable and I regret not double checking what he actually says before I posted. <em>Chatasi.</em> So I wrote a second post correcting my error.</p>

<p>The Torah Temimah lists <em>Damesek</em> as one of many examples where the Torah uses a foreign language in the Torah. He says that the word is used as &#8220;domestic help&#8221; in &#8220;old languages&#8221; and is still used in French in this way.</p>
<p>In the comments, people wonder if this is a big deal. Maybe it&#8217;s not. It definitely shouldn&#8217;t be a big deal but I think it is a big deal. Here is why.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7714" alt="255337-1" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/255337-1.jpg?fit=600%2C600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>There are some questions about the Bible that have traditional answers. But some of those traditional answers appear to be insufficient to Orthodox Jews in 5774. Sometimes the questions are better than the answers. One kind of answer that has been presented and rejected by traditionalists is that the Torah speaks in the language of man and may include anachronisms that made sense to the original intended audience in a way that our modern ears can&#8217;t relate.</p>
<p>The reason this approach is rejected is because it breaks some of the self imposed traditional frum rules of learning Torah. It&#8217;s considered too liberal or too reform-like to allow for non-eternal meanings to the Torah.</p>
<p>Two of the arguments used to bolster this claim are that the Torah was a closed book at Sinai and that the Torah cannot be influenced by factors external to the text itself. The commonly held position on the closing of the Bible is that everything was taught at Sinai. Opinions that allow for the final verses (and more) to have been added by later prophets from unimpeachable sources are shunned because they burst this bubble. Similarly, allowing for outside influence into the Torah implies that the Torah is somewhat subjective. For example, the famous statement of Maimonides that sacrifices were a concession to a people with pagan leanings is considered borderline problematic. The conventional wisdom is that if the Torah included sacrifices it must have been God&#8217;s &#8220;original intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Showing that the Torah is a book with external influence bolsters the claim of Maimonides and may allow for extending it to other ideas in the Torah. This is considered dangerous and out of bounds for &#8220;Torah True&#8221; Jews.</p>
<p>Whenever we have traditionally accepted sources that allow for outside influence we are showing that the contemporary reluctance to this kind of interpretation actually runs counter to tradition. The Torah Temimah had no problem listing several places in the Bible where the Torah borrows from other languages. This is a big deal.</p>
<p>Of the two options above, let&#8217;s call them &#8220;closed book&#8221; and &#8220;not completely closed book,&#8221; which fits better with this Torah Temimah? It&#8217;s clearly the &#8220;not completely closed book&#8221; option. In other words, we are reinforcing the idea that the Torah could have outside influences. Why would the Torah use a non-Bible word it its text? It certainly could have used a native word or invented a Biblical word. Why didn&#8217;t it? Isn&#8217;t the obvious answer that the Torah was speaking to an audience familiar with these words and thus it chose to use familiar language?</p>
<p>The implication of that answer is that the Torah considers its audience. It spoke in a way that people would expect it to speak. It&#8217;s an eternal book that was written under specific circumstances. Therefore we are able to extend this theory to answer questions we have with new non-traditional answers. The answers might be new, but the approach is not new. Of course we are not at liberty to change it or ignore its commands, God forbid. But we can understand many of its tenets, rules, and stories in this context.</p>
<p>This might shed light on the Creation Story and the Flood Story. Or not. But I think it should be an option on the table for Orthodox Jews.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sadducees.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7040" alt="sadducees" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sadducees.jpg?resize=264%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>It is a commonly held belief in the orthodox Jewish community that the Sadducees and the Karaites are basically the same thing. The Sadducees, along with other sectarians, challenged the Pharisees and their interpretations of the Written Torah.</p>
<p>However, as I hope to explore a bit in a post sometime soon, they had their own Oral Traditions and methodology. It was a close cousin to the Pharisees and they did not disagree on all that much nor was there a very wide berth separating the groups. There was even some cross-pollination and we will see in that future post.</p>
<p>The Karaites came on the scene 800 years later. The Sadducees were long gone and the only group that was left standing from the tumultuous Second Temple Period were the Pharisees. While in some small ways, one can trace Karaite theology to some aspects of sectarian Second Temple movements, there was likely no continued, unbroken chain connected them to sectarians.</p>
<p><span id="more-7038"></span></p>
<p>This has been debated in academic circles for a while now and I don&#8217;t intend on resolving the debate in this post although I lean toward the side that says that Karaites started from scratch in the 9th century as a response to Islam.</p>
<p>Either way, it has become accepted wisdom in orthodox Judaism that Karaites are very similar to Sadducees and the terms are used interchangebly. I may have found an early source for this confusion. In his commentary on the Mishna in Avos, Maimonides says that Antignos Ish Socho taught that we should not do Mitzvos in anticipation of reward. Maimonides quotes the Avos D&#8217;Rabbi Nosson and writes that Tzadok and Bytus took this to mean that there is no reward in the next world and thereby launched their respective sectarian groups of the Sadducees (Tzadokim) and Boethusians (Bytusim). Maimonides continues and says that these groups survived to this very day (12th century) and are now called Karaites.</p>
<p>It seems that Maimonides lumps them together. This might be a mistake or just a clumsy way of grouping similar groups together. In truth, they are not so similar. Karaites would reject the Sadducee interpretations of the Torah as much as they would deny the truth of Pharisee interpretations. It&#8217;s imprecise to lump them together in an academic sense. Perhaps it makes sense to lump them together in a religious sense.</p>
<p>I think that this note by Maimonides could be one of the reasons rabbinic orthodox Judaism now fails to distinguish between the two groups. I would prefer precision for the sake of accuracy and truth. But more importantly, there is a lot we can learn about contemporary Judaism by looking at these groups and we can only even begin to do this if we have our terminology correct. Now that we do, I hope to continue exploring the relationship between the Pharisees and Sadducees in my next post on this topic. Hopefully tomorrow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7033" alt="library-books" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/library-books.jpg?resize=298%2C300" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>There are several dozen prohibitions in the Torah that relate to idol worship. Writing in the 12th century, Maimonides stridently warns against studying the texts of idolatry or even learning about idol worship. (Hilchos Avodas Kochavim 2:2)</p>
<p>The argument against interfacing with idol worship is that the human mind is drawn towards the things that one studies. One is not always in perfect control of what one thinks and what one wants. So even if one is studying for the sake of satisfying curiosity, or even learning to rebut, one may be drawn toward idol worship. Maimonides extends this law to include heresy as well.</p>
<p>This is all kinds of depressing. Under this view, it can be extremely dangerous to study anything one does not already believe because whatever one studies for whatever reason can have a very negative influence. While it might be interesting to debate or dispute this assumption, I think there is a great positive lesson to be learned as well.<span id="more-7032"></span></p>
<p>If we are drawn toward the &#8220;wrong&#8221; things by studying them, we can also be drawn to the &#8220;right&#8221; things by studying them. If we want to be more drawn to our Judaism, we can jumpstart ourselves by studying Torah. It doesn&#8217;t have to be anything specific, it can be anything. I think a lot of people study things that they don&#8217;t enjoy and that causes them to want to study less. We would be wise to broaden the scope of what we study as a collective unit and give more people more opportunities to find things they enjoy studying. One doesn&#8217;t have to study the familiar texts. Study whatever Jewish texts you want. It seems that when one learns about anything, one is drawn toward that thing. We want to be more drawn to our Judaism. Let&#8217;s study.</p>
<p>Studying Torah is valuable for so many reasons. This just seems like another side benefit.</p>
<p>This is the most important thing we can do to keep ourselves, children, and communities on the path of Judaism. Study. We are the People of the Book and it is our duty to study and know the Book. Judaism requires us to be knowledgeable. But learning about Judaism seems like good advice anyway, even for people who are already quite observant. We should study things that we want to be drawn toward. Study Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6919" alt="A-7-toward-A-8" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A-7-toward-A-8.jpg?resize=300%2C203" data-recalc-dims="1" />It&#8217;s amazing how often I can be talking with someone about Rambam and they are surprised when I tell them that it seems to me that Maimonides rejected mysticism. I am almost certain of it and I can show how it is a very nearly impossible presumption to disprove. But greater minds than mine have either doubted or rejected this claim so I try to keep an open mind.</p>
<p>There are four typical responses when people first hear that Rambam rejected mysticism:</p>
<p>1) It&#8217;s not true. They&#8217;ll quote the Brisker Rav who supposedly said that every line in the Moreh Nevuchim is based on 100 lines in the Zohar. Or the the Lubavitch view that Rambam was such a deep writer that it only appears to be &#8220;nigleh&#8221; but really it&#8217;s all nistar.</p>
<p>2) Nebach, Rambam never had a chance to learn real kabbalah because he was isolated. But if he did, he would have been a mystic for sure.</p>
<p>3) Of course Rambam held of mysticism, he just did not anything mystical in his books for some reason. [Insert reason]
<p>4) That&#8217;s cool. Tell me more.</p>
<p>I teach a Rambam class on Sunday mornings.<span id="more-6904"></span> We just learn Mishneh Torah and I provide insights based on the commentaries and my own personal experiences. From time to time, we learn a law in the text that reaffirms the rationalistic tendencies of Rambam. Here is an example.</p>
<p>מי שנידוהו בחלום אפילו ידע מי נידהו צריך עשרה בני אדם ששונין הלכות להתירו מנידויו ואם לא מצא טורח אחריהם עד פרסא לא מצא מתירים לו אפילו עשרה ששונים משנה לא מצא מתירין לו עשרה שיודעים לקרות בתורה לא מצא מתירין לו אפילו עשרה שאינן יודעין לקרות לא מצא במקומו עשרה מתירין לו אפילו שלשה.</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means if someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication. If he can&#8217;t find 10 people he should walk up to a <em>parsa</em> to find the requisite number of people.</p>
<p>From where does Rambam get this law? From the Talmud.</p>
<p>(אמר רב יוסף: נידוהו בחלום, צריך עשרה בני אדם להתיר לו.והוא דתנו הלכתא; אבל מתנו ולא תנו, לא. ואי ליכא דתנו הלכתא, אפילו מתנו ולא תנו.ואי ליכא, ליזיל וליתב אפרשת דרכים, ויהיב שלמא לבי עשרה, עד דמקלעי ליה עשרה דגמרי הלכתא. (נדרים ח א</p>
<p>Loosely translated and truncated this means that someone was placed in excommunication in a dream they should find 10 people to nullify the dreamy excommunication, if he can&#8217;t find 1o people he should wait at the פרשת דרכים &#8211; junction &#8211; until he finds enough people.</p>
<p>The medieval commentators explain why he should go to the junction. Some say that he should greet everyone who he sees with a Shalom Aleichem and they will reply Aleichem Shalom. This will protect him from the apparent decree that has been decided against him as shown by the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>This interpretation assumes that the blessing of Aleichem Shalom actually protects someone. This is a mystical idea.</p>
<p>Rambam is uncomfortable with this idea. So either he uses a variant text (I have not seen any manuscripts with this text) or he changes the words פרשת דרכים to the word פרסא. They sound similar, but they have completely different meanings in this context. If you go with the concept found in the Talmud you are relying on mysticism to &#8220;keep you safe&#8221; until you can properly nullify the dreamy excommunication. If you go with Rambam&#8217;s version, it&#8217;s just a limitation on how far one must go to find people to nullify the dreamy excommunication.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the explanation for this law in the Mishneh Torah has nothing to do with mysticism and rationalism? Sure. But the most elegant explanation is that Rambam made a conscious choice to excise this mystical idea from his book of law. Especially when you consider this example among the mountains of other similar instances.</p>
<p>All this means is that Rambam seems to have made an effort to be as rationalist as possible in the Mishneh Torah. Further conclusions are conjecture. Personally, when I see 100 signs telling me to go one direction, I figure that I should go in that direction. To me it seems that Rambam theologically rejected mysticism in every instance possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/antisemitism.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6503" title="antisemitism" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/antisemitism.jpg?resize=245%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>At times like these, when Israel engages in a military operation and the world watches, two things are guaranteed: There will be biased or unfair reporting against Israel and there will be claims of anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Anti-Semitism is an interesting thing. There certainly is precedent for Jew Hating and Jew Killing. Historically, this was an ideological position that was espoused by dominant religion against Jews. Whether it was Christians or Muslims, Jew hating was part of their religious beliefs. As the Western World became less fervently religious anti-Semitism spilled over into the secular world as well.</p>
<p>Along with anti-Semitism, dominant groups have long hated the &#8220;other&#8221;. Sometimes dominant groups hated each other. There are minorities in the United States of America, Land of the Free and Home of the Brave, that suffer discrimination on a regular basis.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t argue whether there is something &#8220;different&#8221; about anti-Semitism or not in this post. I am not convinced that hating Jews is catergorically different than hating any other &#8220;different group&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rabbi Slifkin, who I love and with whom I have the pleasure of a personal friendship, argues in his recent post that anti-Semitism can be used as a source of inspiration to believe in God.<span id="more-6502"></span></p>
<p>Here is the punchline:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Many readers are struggling with the fundamentals of faith. Is it rational to believe that there is something special about the Jews? That we are the chosen people? Aren&#8217;t we just yet another nation with delusions of grandeur?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I think that one can also draw faith, albeit in an odd way, from the blood libel, especially in its contemporary incarnation. In the entire global history of armed conflict, no nation has done remotely as much as Israel to minimize civilian (and even military) casualties amongst its enemies. Yet simultaneously, no nation receives remotely as much condemnation for killing civilians!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Is this normal?! Does this reflect a world in which there is nothing other than the order of nature?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Like I said, it&#8217;s somewhat odd to draw faith from something negative. But I find it to be an enormously powerful example of how there is something unique about the Jewish People. Overwhelming, bizarrely irrational global hatred; and yet we have survived, and returned to our homeland. Am Yisrael Chai!</em></p>
<p>I agree with Rabbi Slifkin that we should definitely try to draw faith from wherever we can draw it. I&#8217;ve written the same thing in a different context.</p>
<p>However, I was curious if Rabbi Slifkin actually meant that anti-Semitism is due to some supernatural cause or if it was simply irrational for people to hate Jews. His answer? The former. In other words, according to Rabbi Slifkin, the world&#8217;s irrational hatred for us is Divinely ordained. (I think that is what he was saying. I am not trying to put words in his mouth.)</p>
<p>While I said above that I won&#8217;t argue whether the phenomena of anti-Semitism is unique, I also will not argue that it is not irrational. But I will argue that just because it might be unique and irrational it does not imply that God is causing anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>The view of Maimonides (and some would argue Nachmanides) regarding God&#8217;s interaction with the world is that it is limited. It mostly manifests itself through Nature, as created by God. Miracles occur from time to time and bend or break the rules of nature. Not everyone agrees with this view of God&#8217;s interaction with the world. Certainly there are much more expansive views and in fact those views have taken hold in orthodox Judaism as mainstream opinions.</p>
<p>Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s website is called Rationalist Judaism. While there is no such thing as pure Rationalism when it comes to Judaism, there are some basic principles to Rationalist Judaism. One of those principles, I believe, is &#8220;minimalism&#8221;. That is, when there is no need to rely on a supernatural phenomena or a fantastical interpretation, Rationalist Judaism does not do so. If we say that anti-Semitism is supernatural, I think we are saying that God interferes with nature and puts the anti-Semitism into the world. I think that is what it means when we say that anti-Semitism is Divine.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument let us presume that anti-Semitism is unique and irrational. I don&#8217;t believe that it implies Divinity. Hatred of other groups is also unique (maybe) and definitely irrational. Would we make the same claim and say that those minorities are persecuted by some Divine measure? I don&#8217;t think Rationalist Judaism would. Which leaves me to wonder, why would we do so when it comes to hatred or dehumanization of us Jews?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we are forced to say that anti-Semitism implies a supernatural cause. Unless one already believes <em>everything</em> is caused supernaturally (a fine, traditional position) I don&#8217;t see why anti-Semitism should be different.</p>

(See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/11/12/an-interesting-torah-temimah-on-nashim-datan-kalot/">An Interesting Torah Temimah on Nashim Datan Kalot</a>) This week I discovered another interesting comment from the Torah Temimah that I think is also significant but not as significant.</p>
<p>Parshas Toldos begins with a confused Rivkah wondering why she was experiencing a very strange pregnancy. The passuk says וַתֵּלֶךְ, לִדְרֹשׁ אֶת-יְהוָה. Rivkah went to inquire with God. The verse does not say how exactly she made this inquiry.</p>
<p>The commentaries offer two main options. 1) She inquired with a prophet. 2) She prayed to God (Ramban).</p>
<p>The Torah continues and tells us: ,&#8230;וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה לָהּ &#8211; God said to her&#8230; Here the commentaries say that she was answered via prophecy. It could be that the Ramban would say that she was answered directly, but he does not comment on these words.</p>
<p>The Torah Temimah mentions some speculation that the reason that God did not speak to her directly was because as a general rule God does not speak to women (save for Sarah) as per the Jerusalem Talmud in Sota (7:1) (apologies to Michelle Bachmann). However, the Torah Temimah directs us to his commentary in Parshas Vayera where the Torah tells us that God spoke directly to Sarah. Here he quotes the Jerusalem Talmud and then expands on it in his commentary.<span id="more-6490"></span></p>
<p>Here is what he says  (translation my own, parentheticals are my additions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This exegesis requires explanation in general, because we have seen several women who were prophetesses, as the (Babylonian) Talmud counts on 14A, Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Chana, Avigayil, Chuldah, Esther, and is so how is it that the Jerusalem Talmud says that we do not find God talking with women, since these women were prophetesses he must have spoke to them!?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And me must say that God&#8217;s talking with the prophetesses must have been with regard to public matters, whereas with regard to private matters God only spoke directly with Sarah. And that which it says when God spoke to Eve and Rebecca it must have been with a go-between as we explained there.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Also we can answer this question according to that which is written in the Guide (for the Perplexed by Maimonides) chapter 45, where he counts 11 levels of prophecy, and the level of prophecy for women is until the seventh level, look there, and according to this it can be said that the intent here (Jerusalem Talmud) is that Sarah reached the level of prophecy that is the pinnacle of prophecy, and that is the level of prophecy of (King) Solomon, and this is not the place to expound further.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a huge thing, but I see this as the Torah Temimah trying to &#8220;soften the blow&#8221;. The Jerusalem Talmud takes a very harsh stance towards women and their spiritual capabilities and the Torah Temimah doesn&#8217;t think that this is a great message. In classic rabbinic form he reinterprets the statement from the Jerusalem Talmud to make it much more palatable. It&#8217;s not women&#8217;s liberation propaganda. It&#8217;s not going to be in JOFA&#8217;s literature. But it is something. It might be an acknowledgement from a great Torah scholar that taken at face value, this is an offensive statement towards women.</p>
<p>I think that most women would feel more comfortable serving God that does talk to women than a God who does not talk to women. It could be that the Torah Temimah was trying to ensure that women not be led to believe that the simple reading of the Jerusalem Talmud is the only authority on the matter.</p>
<p>Then again, it might just be a commentator trying to reconcile contradictory statements. But I think that every exegete chooses their battles. The fact that the Torah Temimah chose this battle shows me something.</p>
<p>Read the Torah Temimah here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/seferid_14052_page_171.pdf" target="_blank">Toldos</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/seferid_14052_page_239.pdf" target="_blank">Vayera</a></p>

<p>We finished chapter 3 today. The Rambam gives some positive reinforcement to those Torah scholars who work for a living. As always, this was met with a rejoinder of this recurring discussion. One unresolved issue was an apparent contradiction between the advisement that one should sleep eight hours in Yesodei HaTorah and here we learned about the idea that one should banish sleep from their eyes if they wish to acquire Torah.</p>

What follows is not a discussion of the practical halacha. Rather, this is an exploration of the sources in the writings of the Rambam.</p>
<p>In a responsa, R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein clearly holds that one is permitted to take money to study in Kollel, <em>even</em> according to the Rambam. See the Responsa here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/R-Moshe-Kollel.pdf" target="_blank">Igros Moshe</a>. Indeed, the Kesef Mishnah largely dismisses the sources for Maimonides&#8217; position and simply states that no one really goes with this Rambam.</p>
<p>So it is clear, this is not a referendum on Kollel. This is simply an academic exercise to determine precisely what Maimonides meant in two seemingly conflicting passages.</p>
<p>We begin with the source that seems to frown upon one benefitting financially from one&#8217;s status as a Torah scholar and shunning typical work.<span id="more-5699"></span> <em>(Translations courtesy of Rabbi Touger)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mishneh Torah, Talmud Torah, 3:10</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Anyone who comes to the conclusion that he should involve himself in Torah study without doing work and derive his livelihood from charity, desecrates [God&#8217;s] name, dishonors the Torah, extinguishes the light of faith, brings evil upon himself, and forfeits the life of the world to come, for it is forbidden to derive benefit from the words of Torah in this world.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Our Sages declared: &#8220;Whoever benefits from the words of Torah forfeits his life in the world.&#8221; Also, they commanded and declared: &#8220;Do not make them a crown to magnify oneself, nor an axe to chop with.&#8221; Also, they commanded and declared: &#8220;Love work and despise Rabbinic positions.&#8221; All Torah that is not accompanied by work will eventually be negated and lead to sin. Ultimately, such a person will steal from others.</p>
<p>This is a pretty hard line. If we would stop here, we would be left with one obvious conclusion. The Rambam holds that one must earn a living through any means besides one&#8217;s Torah prowess. One is obligated to study and achieve scholarship in Torah. But one is not allowed to leverage one&#8217;s Torah status into a free ride. It seems unequivocal from this source.</p>
<p>But then we turn to the end of the Laws of Shmitta and Yovel.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mishneh Torah, Shmitta V&#8217;Yovel, 13:12</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Why did the Levites not receive a portion in the inheritance of Eretz Yisrael and in the spoils of war like their brethren? Because they were set aside to serve God and minister unto Him and to instruct people at large in His just paths and righteous judgments, as [Deuteronomy 33:10] states: &#8220;They will teach Your judgments to Jacob and Your Torah to Israel.&#8221; Therefore they were set apart from the ways of the world. They do not wage war like the remainder of the Jewish people, nor do they receive an inheritance, nor do they acquire for themselves through their physical power. Instead, they are God&#8217;s legion, as [ibid.:11]: states: &#8220;God has blessed His legion&#8221; and He provides for them, as [Numbers 18:20] states: &#8220;I am your portion and your inheritance.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Mishneh Torah, Shmitta V&#8217;Yovel, 13:13</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Not only the tribe of Levi, but any one of the inhabitants of the world whose spirit generously motivates him and he understands with his wisdom to set himself aside and stand before God to serve Him and minister to Him and to know God, proceeding justly as God made him, removing from his neck the yoke of the many reckonings which people seek, he is sanctified as holy of holies. God will be His portion and heritage forever and will provide what is sufficient for him in this world like He provides for the priests and the Levites. And thus David declared [Psalms 16:5]: &#8220;God is the lot of my portion; You are my cup, You support my lot.&#8221;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Blessed be the Merciful One who provides assistance.</p>
<p>To summarize these two selections: The Levites did not bear the burden of earning a livelihood. They were the tribe of teachers and servants of God. They were supported by the tithes that the Jewish people gave to them. This is what it means in Numbers when it states &#8220;I am your <em>portion</em> and your inheritance&#8221;. The &#8220;I&#8221; refers to God and the method by which He is the portion of the Levites is that He provides for them via the tithes.</p>
<p>Next, the Rambam provides an allowance for  a non-Levite to do the same. The non-Levite can dedicate his life to God as well. God will be his <em>portion</em> as well. What does it mean to be God&#8217;s portion in this context? It would seem that it would be analogous to being supported by tithes, that is via charity.</p>
<p>So which is it? Can a Torah scholar who wants to teach and inspire remove the shackles of earning a living and be supported by God, meaning charity? Or not?</p>
<p>I think the resolution to this problem is really quite simple once we look at <strong>Commentary on the Mishnah of Maimonides</strong>. In the fourth chapter of Ethics of our Fathers, <em>Rabbi Tzadok says that one should not use the Torah as a crown to appear great. Further, one should not use the Torah as a plowshare to be used for plowing.</em></p>
<p>Maimonides gets on his soapbox and literally rants for several paragraphs about the issue we are discussing in this post. He says that he is going to be very clear because his opponents, the greatest of the Torah scholars of the time, twist the sources to suit their needs and will not change their minds even though they are absolutely incorrect. It seems that the primary complaint he raises against them was that they required people donate charity against their will to support people who were studying until those people were too old and frail to work and then they needed the money simply to live.</p>
<p>Among his proofs that he is correct are assertions that the great Tannaim and Amoraim all worked for a living. He then uses two stories from the Talmud to demonstrate that the giants of the Talmud refused to use their scholarly status for personal gain or financial gain.</p>
<p>All the way at the end of his truly epic manifesto on this subject are the key phrases to unlocking this secret. What follows is the best translation I could muster. Items in brackets are my additions to make the text clearer. All emphasis and errors are mine. (Full Hebrew text here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0907.jpg%20" target="_blank">Page 1</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0908.jpg%20" target="_blank">page 2</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0909.jpg%20" target="_blank">page 3</a>, <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_0910.jpg" target="_blank">page 4</a>)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But the thing that the Torah did permit for Torah scholars [to benefit from their scholarship] is to allow someone else to manage their investments on their behalf, if the other person is willing [and to do it free of charge], and one who does this for a Torah scholar will receive [heavenly] reward for his efforts, and this is one who fills the pockets of Talmidei Chachamim [who is privileged to sit in the Heavenly Academy as per Pesachim 53B]. Similarly, to [make a deal whereby one makes a standing] offer to purchase all of the Torah scholar&#8217;s goods before they hit the marketplace [is permissible] because these are the special rights that God has provided [Torah scholars] <em>just like God provides the gifts and tithes to the Priests and Levites, </em>as this [the enumerated special rights] come to the Torah scholars through that prophets. Similarly, the Torah exempts Torah scholars from all community taxes that are used for infrastructure needs and other public works, even if he is a wealthy Torah scholar he is exempt from these payments. [&#8230;] and these exemptions are similar to the exemption the Priest had from paying the half-shekel as we have explained in its place. And so too all analogous cases.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we have the resolution to our problem. In the Commentary to the Mishnah, Maimonides describes minor economic benefits as appropriate for Torah Scholars. In his views, these benefits are God given. He then compares these minor benefits to the benefits that God provides the Priest and Levite. In other words, when he writes in Shmitta and Yovel that God will provide for the Torah scholar just as God provides for the Levite it seems that he is referring to this kind of economic benefit. It <em>does not </em>mean that God will provide for the Torah scholar through charity. Rather, as we have seen, there are some economic benefits through which the Torah scholar may get a leg up on the competition.</p>
<p>Maimonides&#8217; objection to benefitting financially from Torah scholar status or the dissemination of Torah remains constant. It is forbidden to use communal funds to support Torah scholars and it is forbidden for Torah scholars to take money in return for Torah related services. When Maimonides mentions the idea that a non-Levite can dedicate his life to God and God will provide, the meaning is that God will provide via the minor economic benefits enumerated above. It does not mean that God will provide via miracles or charity.</p>
<p>True to his teaching, Maimonides earned a livelihood as a physician. But it is also possible that he availed himself to the economic benefit he mentions in the excerpt from the Commentary on the Mishnah. We know that his brother David managed his investments on his behalf. It is certainly not outside the realm of possibility the David did not charge his brother Moses for his services as per the economic benefit accorded to Torah scholars.</p>
<p>In closing, I think Maimonides was in fact speaking to a specific set of circumstances when he unequivocally banned Torah scholars from using their Torah knowledge to earn a living. It seems it was an involuntary system that he most abhorred as well. Today, most people supporting others in learning and rabbis or teachers taking salaries for Torah related jobs are under very different circumstances whether it is the giver or the taker. Certainly, the refrain of the Kesef Mishnah is appropriate in our day and age. If we don&#8217;t support some Torah scholars we might not have any Torah scholars!</p>
<p>However, to assert that Kollel as a standard for everyone is the &#8220;way it always was and always will be&#8221; is to ignore the plain facts as Maimonides saw them. In his opinion, the Torah sources demand everyone achieve Torah scholarship and that they earn a living from another source of income. Even if we do not find Maimonides&#8217; ruling binding on us today, his social commentary still carries a lot of weight. He felt the ultimate Jewish society did not need to pay non-Priests and non-Levites to learn and teach Torah. He certainly felt that we are supposed to work and earn a living and not that earning a living is only for the weak Torah scholars or unsuccessful Yeshiva students.</p>
<p>No matter how the orthodox Jewish community proceeds, I think it worthwhile to present this view of Maimonides approach to, at the very least, lessen the unfortunate stigma that has become attached to people going to work for a living. Working for a living should feel like the right thing to do because according to Maimonides that is how it is supposed to be and how it always has been.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/800px-Human_evolution.svg_.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5696" title="800px-Human_evolution.svg" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/800px-Human_evolution.svg_.png?resize=300%2C187" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Some interesting numbers were released by Gallup. They polled Americans on core issues of belief and science and were met with some surprising results.</p>
<p>The numbers are mostly steady over the last 30 years, which also has some significance in my opinion.</p>
<p>Of particular note, are the evolution numbers. 46% of Americans believe that God created the world within the last 10,000 years. 15% believe that humans evolved and God played no role in the process. 32% believe that Humans evolved and God guided the process.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing. Science has basically accepted that evolution exists. The 46% that basically deny evolution completely are doing so in direct opposition to logical, rational, evidence-based, thinking.</p>
<p>I am NOT referring to the group that believes that evolution is a mechanism used by God. Those people are reconciling their beliefs with science. Whether it &#8220;works&#8221; or not is a separate discussion. I am only referring to the 46% who flat out disagree with science on the question of evolution.</p>
<p>How does this happen?<span id="more-5695"></span></p>
<p>An article in the New Yorker explains some of the science behind the rejection of science. Turns out that we are deeply embedded beliefs based on what we might call common sense. When science contradicts common sense, even when we <em>know</em> that the science is correct, our brains try to push us in the direction of common sense. It takes <em>effort</em> for our brains to choose what we know to be true when it contradicts our perception of what &#8220;makes sense&#8221;.</p>
<p>Evolution is not something that our brains are comfortable with. It is a difficult thing for us to accept. Common sense does not favor evolution. It is only though research and advanced scientific tools that evolution becomes the reasonable choice.</p>
<p>Even ideas that have 99% acceptance rates work this way. For example, almost everyone agrees that the earth goes around the sun. But common sense says that the sun goes around the earth. The ancients believed that the sun went around the earth and only recently has science proved this to be false. Now we all <em>know </em>that the earth goes around the sun. Yet, when measuring specific brain activity levels, it can be demonstrated that we have a hard time convincing our brains that this is the truth.</p>
<p>This explains the discomfort we feel due to cognitive dissonance. Your brain literally wants to use common sense and it takes effort to follow logic and reason.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? It means that we are preprogrammed to favor common sense. It takes work to override that default position. Sometimes common sense is right but other times it is not right. The greatest tool we have in overriding our default settings is education. The more we know and the more we process new information, the more our brains accept changes to their programming.</p>
<p>When it comes to religious beliefs, even within those who believe in God and are religious there are some more common sense or folksy beliefs that come natural to people. Many of these beliefs are not essential and may even be wrong. But people cling to their folk beliefs despite evidence to the contrary &#8211; <em>even within their own religious texts and writings.</em></p>
<p>This is why Maimonidean Rationalism failed. It takes too much work to deprogram the common sense beliefs in mysticism for it to work for the masses. It&#8217;s been 900 years already and it still isn&#8217;t catching on. Perhaps with new evidence and more information, it will catch on. I sure hope it does.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DoctorCartoon.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5542" title="DoctorCartoon" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DoctorCartoon.jpg?resize=193%2C300" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>Yeshiva University Museum, (I had no idea that there was such a place,) is hosting an exhibit on Jewish doctors. You know the famous joke about the inauguration of the first Jewish president? His mother is in the front row sitting next to her old Jewish lady friends and as the president-elect gets up on the podium, she tells her friend, ya know, his brother is a Doctor!</p>
<p>Yes, there is a Jewish doctor stereotype, but this article on the NY Times about the exhibit gives us a clue as to how this happened. Judaism does not view medicine as heretical or an affront to religion. On the contrary, the doctor is considered the emissary of God and an ally in the healing process.</p>
<p>Judaism does not allow people to rely on God for Divine Intervention or a miracle in lieu of seeking professional medical help. There is no faith healing or reluctance to seek human intervention in Judaism. And so, a culture of favoring medicine over faith is intrinsic to the Jewish experience. In fact, one of the most influential and important Jewish scholars of all time was Maimonides. He was a physician as well as a scholar.<span id="more-5540"></span></p>
<p>My grandfather was a medical consultant by trade. He was the president of Laniado Hospital in Netanya, Israel. He was the person who built the hospital and brought the Klausenberg Rebbe&#8217;s dream into reality. He was very fond of quoting the Rebbe in this regard. When someone would come to the Rebbe for a blessing or advice, before anything else the Rebbe would ask &#8220;<em>Vos zugt der doctor</em>&#8221; &#8211; what does the doctor say.</p>
<p>This was to reinforce the message that health and sickness are very dependent on what the doctor says and what the doctor does.</p>
<p>Of course, the exhibition will also highlight some of the anti-Semitism that Jewish doctors have faced over the last few hundred years. At one point, Catholics were not permitted to seek medical help from a Jewish doctor. Sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>If you are in New York, you might find the exhibit interesting. I hope I will be able to see it some time over the summer.</p>

<p>Maimonides was a hyper-rationalist. He did not believe in mysticism and fought vehemently against it. One aspect of mysticism is praying at tombs of holy people. Yet, for hundreds of years people have made pilgrimage to Tiberias in the north of Israel to pay respect a the grave of Maimonides and pray at his tomb.</p>
<p>Compared with other holy sites, the tomb of Maimonides is in need of renovations and a facelift. A $10 million project will spruce up the tomb and make it more inviting for visitors.</p>
<p>The problem is that Maimonides himself felt strongly that one should not make a grave into a holy site.</p>
<p>As Rabbi Donniel Hartmann paraphrased the words of Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah:  &#8220;For holy men, no headstones should be built on their graves because their words are their memory&#8230; and people should not visit graves.&#8221; It&#8217;s pretty clear that Maimonides would not be in favor of this renovation or visitors to his tomb.<span id="more-5512"></span></p>
<p>So is it ironic? Or a chutzpah?</p>
<p>It feels similar to Mormons baptizing Jews. It&#8217;s one religious group using their beliefs in an ironic way. Jews don&#8217;t believe in Jesus so we don&#8217;t really care for the Baptism. But Mormons feel like they are doing us a favor. Similarly, Maimonides didn&#8217;t believe in praying at grave sites, but mystics probably feel like they are doing him a favor by praying at his site even though they must think that he was wrong about the whole not praying at grave sites thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, I find it amusing.</p>
<p>I saved this post for International Jewish Mysticism Day (otherwise known as Lag B&#8217;Omer) to lodge a tiny rationalist counterbalance against the overwhelming mysticism of the day. That is my way of being ironic.</p>

Fifty years ago a pair of scientists plunged to the deepest part of the ocean. They went together. They had each other. But Cameron went alone. That is a completely different experience.</p>
<p>When one is alone, there is no noise, no distractions, just oneness with whatever one is experiencing. Cameron&#8217;s experience in the depths is different than the previous mission half a century ago. He did it alone. The voices inside his head spoke to him and there was no one there to distract him.</p>
<p>Alone, Cameron saw and experienced things that almost no one has ever seen. He saw wonders of the universe that have been hidden out of sight virtually forever. The voyage must have been magical.</p>
<p>As expected, Cameron was asked about the journey that took him nearly 7 miles below the surface.<span id="more-5334"></span> His response:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;There had to be a moment where I just stopped and just took it in and said &#8216;This is where I am, I&#8217;m at the bottom of the ocean, the deepest place in the world and what does that mean?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I just sat there looking out the window, looking out at this kind of barren, desolate, lunar plain and appreciate it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Appreciation. That is the true and stark emotion that Cameron felt during his expedition. The world is so intricate and complex. Many parts of it are so distant and unreachable. By going where he went, Cameron unlocked a bit of the mystery of our world. Experiencing that alone gave him time and space to digest those awesome moments and truly appreciate them.</p>
<p>Cameron also asks an important question about his time in the abyss: <em>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>For an atheist it might mean nothing. Or it might mean something. Who knows?</p>
<p>But for us, it means something very important. Our world and its glorious detail is part of a creation that humbles us with its impressiveness. What are we do to do when we are inspired by our universe? What is the universe telling us?</p>
<p>Maimonides writes that the way for one to come to love God is to appreciate our incredible universe. The fingerprints of God are all over nature. The beauty of our world is inspiring. The problem is that most of us are too distracted to notice it. Sometimes it takes a long journey to the most remote place without any distractions to turn our minds on to our world.</p>
<p>James Cameron is an atheist. His experience did not bring him to love God because he doesn&#8217;t believe that God exists. But we can all learn from his reaction to what he saw and felt down there. For us believers, the more we turn ourselves on to our world, the greater our appreciation must be for God. Learning about the cosmos or marine life or chemistry or biology or physics are key elements to developing an appreciation for and love for God.</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to be reminded to lose the distractions. When we do, perhaps we will be lucky enough to hear the music of God&#8217;s universe singing to us its glorious song.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/superstition.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5148" title="superstition" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/superstition-300x214.jpg?resize=300%2C214" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>A light hearted article in Tablet Magazine caught my eye today. The writer, Allison Hoffman, is a reform Jew who is in the midst of a pregnancy.</p>
<p>As a reform Jew, Ms. Hoffman takes pride in her enlightened, rational, science and fact based beliefs. She is not superstitious, nor does she use halacha as a guide for living her life. Like many reform Jews, she may equate the two as one and the same.</p>
<p>The problem for Ms. Hoffman is that during her pregnancy she has developed some nasty superstitions. Like many women who are carrying a fetus inside their body, Ms. Hoffman has developed a need to protect her baby at all costs. And this includes tapping into tried and true superstitions like not calling the baby by name until the baby is born and formally named.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all seen this happen. Perfectly rational people become irrational at certain times. Ms. Hoffman talks about her experience as a pregnant mom. Death does the same thing to other rationalists. Illness does it to others. Ironically enough, this phenomena has a scientific explanation too. When there is a uncertainty and doubt, the mind seeks to establish some control over the situation. Thus superstitions emerge.<span id="more-5147"></span></p>
<p>Ms. Hoffman is disappointed that there are so few superstitions in reform Judaism. The whole thing is rather entertaining. As a side note, it is interesting to see people defend superstitions that were borrowed from pagans or non-Jews as &#8220;real&#8221; or kabbalistic.</p>
<p>Pregnancy is one of life&#8217;s greatest mysteries. So much that is happening is unobservable and the stakes are so high that we want to somehow influence the result. We do what we cant, but we wish we could do more. We start to develop superstitions.</p>
<p>Death is no different. What happens after we die? What happens to the soul? What does it feel like? All these questions cannot be answered by observable fact. Science does not address these questions, other that to say &#8220;nothing&#8221;. Rational people become less rational around death. People who don&#8217;t believe in God or care about Mitzvah observance will come to shul and say Kaddish. I&#8217;m not saying that Kaddish is superstition. I am saying that it is out of character for a rational, non-believer to say a prayer for someone who died.</p>
<p>What does all of this mean?</p>
<p>It means that when things require an explanation but there is no explanation coming, human nature is to turn to a deity. This is what we call The God of Gaps. This belief system asserts that since not everything can be explained the only explanation that remains is God. In other words, God is to be found in the mysteries of life. Superstition and religion are siblings in this model. Closely related. Religion is legitimate beliefs that cover things that we can&#8217;t explain. Superstition are illegitimate beliefs that accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p>The problem with this belief system is that there is a line of progress that is shrinking the gaps. Drastically. What we know today is far more than we knew 20 years ago. Compared with medieval scholars we are all super-scholars. To borrow a phrase: If they are humans we are like angels. If we are humans they are like donkeys. Compared with the ancients we might even know more than they thought God knew! If one of us would travel back to the time of the ancients I am certain that person would be considered a God. This system encourages people to cast skepticism towards science. It causes people to doubt things that can be proved. It does not increase critical thinking. In short, it makes people less sophisticated, not more sophisticated.</p>
<p>The gaps are shrinking. Is God shrinking too?</p>
<p>It does not have to be this way. Maimonides wrote that God is seen in observable phenomena. The <em>more</em> we know about our physical world, the <em>more</em> we can appreciate the greatness of God. This is the opposite of the God of the Gaps. It is the God of Everything. Superstition and religion have nothing to do with each other. One is an attempt to explain things that we can&#8217;t understand. The other is an attribution of everything &#8211; things that we do understand and things that we don&#8217;t understand. In this view, there is no need to add superstitions or be sketical of science. As we discover more and learn new things, we can appreciate and even come to love God more and more. <em>(And don&#8217;t worry, science will never be able to prove that God doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s impossible.)</em> This system encourages progress because more knowledge is not be feared as an antidote to God. This benefits everyone.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day we will know even more about pregnancy and superstitions will become superfluous. We don&#8217;t need the mystery of pregnancy to find and see God. Marvel in its complexity and the &#8220;miracle&#8221; of child-birth. It&#8217;s not what we don&#8217;t know. It is what we do know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/science1.jpeg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-5021" title="science1" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/science1-300x156.jpg?resize=270%2C140" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>We did a family trip to the California Science Center at Exposition Park in Los Angeles yesterday. The museum is nice, albeit a bit outdated. Such is the fate of any museum that has exhibits of the latest and greatest in technology. Cell phones were a new obscure invention according to the exhibit on technology. Even better was the section describing how phone lines are not fast enough for video conferencing. Hehe.</p>
<p>Anyway, the highlights of the museum are the Hubble 3D IMAX movie and the temporary exhibit called 1001 Inventions. The IMAX was incredible. It told the story of the Hubble telescope and some of its most incredible discoveries. It was really powerful to see the beauty and seeming infinite scope of outer space. The 3D images of galaxies and galaxy clusters trillions of light years away is awe-inspiring. The 3D glasses, 9 story screen and excellent sound system make you feel like you are traveling through space. Simply remarkable.</p>
<p>1001 Inventions is an international project that demonstrates some of the technological marvels and advances contributed by the Arab world in the Middle Ages. In a time that is stereotyped as the Dark Ages in Europe, much &#8220;light&#8221; was found in Arab countries. Hundreds of ideas and inventions are part of the exhibit. It is modern and compelling and I really enjoyed it.<span id="more-5017"></span></p>
<p>Socially, the exhibit attracted many Muslims and I found pleasure and inspiration exploring the exhibit side by side with devout Muslims.</p>
<p>Politically, I can anticipate that there are those who will object to the exhibit simply because it portrays Islam in a favorable light. It has become en vogue for social conservatives and progressives to battle over the imagery of Islam in America. Some people find it harmful that Islam be portrayed as peaceful or beneficial to society. Others bend over backwards to ignore Islamic extremism and oppression in Arab countries. I don&#8217;t think either of those approaches are wise or prudent, but that is neither here nor there.</p>
<p>When examining the exhibit through those lenses I think the exhibit was fair. It only spoke to technology and medicine and the scholarship within the Arab word during the Middle Ages. I think this is an message for Arabs and non-Arabs in 2012. It is important for non-Arabs because it reminds them (or informs them) that there is a rich history of wisdom and forward thinking in the Arab world. We need to be thankful for their contributions to society. It is important for Arabs because in its current iteration, it seems as thought the Arab community is mired in backwards thinking. Technology and progress are not priorities. Thinking and scholarship are not priorities either. Advances are not coming from the Arab world at the same rate as they come from Asia, Europe or America. It would be great if this exhibit inspired a return to scholarship and innovation that contributes to the good of the world community. With such a rich history, I would imagine reinvigorating efforts for progress would be natural.</p>
<p>The second take-away from the exhibit that I had was that it tried to show that relations between members of different religions were not always contentious. The best proof of this was the only non-Muslim or Arab with a prominent place in the exhibit. That would be the Maimonides display:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_04561.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5019 aligncenter" title="IMG_0456" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_04561-e1326132152413-768x1024.jpg?resize=592%2C789" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I found the description of Maimonides fair and positive. It might be a bit understated though. I think Maimonides was even more of an iconoclast than he is given credit for in the panel. A video accompanied this panel and went a bit more in depth than the panel. In general, I was very pleased that Maimonides was included in the exhibit.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am sure that some will find nefarious intentions in his inclusions. Something along the lines of the &#8220;Muslims are stealing Maimonides&#8221; or something like that. But I think that is misguided and wrong. The text clearly says that he was a Jewish doctor. Most importantly, the text notes that he helped people of all faiths. Indeed, this is one of the legacies of Maimonides.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The exhibit is worth seeing if you are in LA or one of the other locations. If you have seen it, I am interested in your impressions of the exhibit.</p>

<p>Today we began Chapter 4 in Hilchos Deyos. We tried to get through it quickly. The chapter is a memorandum on medieval medicine. The Rambam advises his readers to follow contemporary medicine to live a healthy life. While the manner by which 11th century physicians advised their patients to live is no longer applicable, we should seek out the same kind of contemporary information to live a healthy life.</p>

Today we began Chapter 4 in Hilchos Deyos. We tried to get through it quickly. The chapter is a memorandum on medieval medicine. The Rambam advises his readers to follow contemporary medicine to live a healthy life. While the manner by which 11th century physicians advised their patients to live is no longer applicable, we should seek out the same kind of contemporary information to live a healthy life.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.

Audio is below.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In anticipation of the upcoming gift giving season I have compiled a short list of books that I think would make a great gift for the orthodox Jewish Rationalist in your life. If that happens to be you, ask for an Amazon gift card and buy these books for yourself!</p>
<p><em>Get an Amazon gift card here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00067L6TQ/ref=nosim/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325" target="_blank">Amazon Gift Cards</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=eliyfink-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /></em></p>
<p>I have read all these books. I wholeheartedly recommend them. I have not done full reviews of most of these books on the blog but I have included a brief description and the rationalist significance of each of these books. I hope that if you have other books to recommend you will leave your suggestions in the comments.</p>
<p><strong>The list:</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4888"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583303693/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1583303693">Masterplan: Judaism&#8211;Its Program, Meaning &amp; Goals</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Carmell, this book is based on R&#8217; Hirsch&#8217;s Horeb. It gives a framework for understanding the structure of Judaism and its commandments. It does so without using a single passage from the mystical sources. It is excellent.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/190411329X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=190411329X">Maimonides&#8217; Confrontation with Mysticism</a> &#8211; Written by Menachem Kellner, this book (without saying so) debunks a common claim made by contemporary orthodox Jews. The claim is that the Rambam would have been a mysticist if only he had received the Kabbalistic Tradition. This book shows that the Rambam specifically set out to forge a rationalist path of Judaism.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00876HOFI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00876HOFI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Hashgachah Pratis: An Exploration of Divine Providence</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Aryeh Leibowitz, this book studies the various approaches to Hashgacha Pratis. There is a maximalist view that is prevalent in orthodox Judaism today. The rationalist is more likely to find meaning in the more minimalist views of the rishonim as they are documented in this book.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906764239/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1906764239">The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides&#8217; Thirteen Principles Reappraised</a> &#8211; Written by Marc Shapiro, this book, in convincing fashion, describes the myriad of opinions on matters of faith. Most people assume the Rambam&#8217;s 13 Principles have universal acceptance among Jewish thinkers throughout the millennium. Shapiro demonstrates that things are not so simple. Every meaningful point in this book is made with a traditional, accepted orthodox Jewish source.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933143150/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=1933143150">The Challenge of Creation: Judaism&#8217;s Encounter with Science, Cosmology, and Evolution</a> &#8211; Written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, this book is a rationalist explanation of Cosmology. This is a particularly difficult area of Torah to navigate without mysticism. Rabbi Slifkin does an excellent job in this book. All of Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s books are excellent. This is the most crucial book for rationalists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933143185/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1933143185">Sacred Monsters: Mysterious and Mythical Creatures of Scripture, Talmud and Midrash</a> &#8211; Also written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, this book explains the various creatures that seem too fantastical to be real. Either they were real and magical creatures exist or they were not real and magical creatures do not exist. This book takes the latter position and explains many of these passages that have troubled rationalists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dovbear-on-the-parsha-dov-bear/1113656036?ean=9781257153367">DovBear on the Parsha</a> &#8211; Written by DovBear, I did a review of this book here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/06/book-review-dovbear-on-the-parsha/">Book Review | DovBear on the Parsha</a>. This is a great book that opens the reader up to a world of pshat and medrash within our mesorah that does not embrace mystical interpretations. It also shows that with a little thinking and hard work, we can all contribute to Torah.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0791408027/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0791408027">In the Shadow of History</a> &#8211; Written by Chacham Jose Faur, this is book that opens one up to a Chacham Faur&#8217;s writings. I could have chosen many of his articles and books. But I believe that this is the most thought provoking of his books and articles that I have read. It is not quite an indispensable rationalist text but Chacham Faur is indispensable so I have suggested at least one of his books in this list.</p>
<p><strong>Double Bonus</strong>: Subscribe to <a href="http://www.hakirah.org/">Ḥakirah</a> and read Rabbi Slifkin&#8217;s blog: <a href="%20http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/">Rationalist Judaism</a></p>

We continued laying the groundwork for the Rambam&#039;s methodology of character development. The basic idea is that wherever one has flaws one should do things that strengthen their character in those areas. We got through the first chapter and began chapter 2.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.

<p>The University of Oxford has made the original manuscript of the Mishnah Torah available online.</p>
<p>Maimonides personally authorized this manuscript. It fell to a later man who stipulated in his will:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>And in its entirety be placed in the keeping of the Bet Din forever, it is not to be sold or redeemed, nor should any single person ever take possession of it. It should rather be kept available so that all scholars can correct their version against it, but not read from it or copy from it. Rather, anyone wishing to correct his version should borrow the volume he needs from the Bet Din, leaving a bond against its value with the Bet Din, until he corrects his own book and returns it. It is a mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased and let no one alter this testament.</em></p>
<p>Now  the manuscript is fully accessible to the public. The Oxford library has digitized every page in high definition and made it available to the public.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m no scholar of ancient texts. But there are scholars of ancient texts. A large group of them has been studying the evolution of the text of the Tanach (the Jewish version of the Old Testament) for 53 years.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the text we have today has remained virtually unchanged since the 11th century. It was then that Maimonides used the Aleppo Codex to codify a version of the Torah scroll. That version is almost exactly what we have today.</p>
<p>But notice, I used the word &#8220;almost&#8221;. That&#8217;s because it is not exactly the same. Or it might not be exact. There are several nuances that differentiate the standard Torah scroll used in the majority of Jewish communities from the Yemenite Torah text tradition. They can&#8217;t both be exactly the same as the text codified by Maimonides.<span id="more-4518"></span></p>
<p>Certainly the Talmud seems to indicate that they had a different version. The Talmud in Kiddushin gives specific places as the middle of the text and the number of words and letters. None of those are consistent with our text. In several places various rishonim (Medieval commentators) indicate that there were small differences between the Torah scrolls among their peers. Other rishonim stated that the text was deliberately changed by later prophets in certain instances. They were permitted to do so as long as none of the Torah&#8217;s laws were affected by their changes.</p>
<p>None of the differences that have been recorded are significant enough to change the law. None of the discrepancies have an effect of the theology or religion of the Torah. Yet, there has emerged a &#8220;sacred belief&#8221; that the Torah remains unchanged over the 3000 years since the Revelation at Sinai.</p>
<p>This is quite obviously impossible.</p>
<p>A massive project in Israel is charting all the extant versions of the text and their collective history. They are using every possible version and manuscript to show any and all minor differences between each version. The Aleppo Codex is the starting point for the project and all differences are being compared to that version.</p>
<p>And there are differences. It is impossible to pretend otherwise. But this should not be a problem for believers in orthodox Judaism. There are several acceptable approaches to the issues raised by the variations in the text. Each approach appeals to different styles within orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>1) Hashgacha pratis. God runs the world. Whatever changes that have evolved are part of a grand Master Plan.</p>
<p>2) Lo bashamayim hi. &#8220;The Torah is not in the Heavens&#8221;. Once the Torah was given to Man, it was understood that there would be mistakes. We do our best to avoid mistakes, but errors are inevitable and it cannot be legitimately stated that our version is perfect.</p>
<p>3) Torah She&#8217;Baal Peh is primary. The truth is that we do not live our lives as orthodox Jews based on the Written Law as much as we lived based on its interpretation in the Oral Law. Mistakes in the Written Law have no real bearing on a Jewish life based on the Oral Law.</p>
<p>Certainly each of these positions is more nuanced and broad than the one or two sentence headlines mentioned here. The point is that approaches exist and we should not be afraid of them.</p>
<p>What about the 8th principle of faith according to the Rambam?</p>

		<itunes:summary>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/rambam.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Rambam class continued today.

We began Chapter 9 which continues the laws of prophecy. This chapter teaches us the eternal nature of the Torah that it cannot be changed at all. This applies even if a prophet is the one who tries to change the Torah.

The class is covering some very interesting material and I hope you enjoy listening. I invite you to join us at the Pacific Jewish Center Bais Medrash / Annex on Sunday mornings 8:50 AM.

Alternatively, you can tune in to the podcasts on the blog.

Audio is below.
