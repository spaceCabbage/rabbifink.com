Part of a (sometimes) weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></address>
<h2>Parshas Vayigash<br />
Learn With Your Children</h2>
<p>After Yosef reveals himself to his brothers he sends them home to tell their father that he is still alive and to please come join him in Mitzrayim. The brothers hasten to their father and exclaim <i>od Yosef chai vchi hu mosheil b’chol Eretz Mitzrayim </i>&#8211; Yosef still lives and he is the ruler over all of Egypt. The Torah continues, <i>vayafag libo ki lo he&#8217;emin lahem </i>&#8211; Yakov&#8217;s heart fluttered because he did not believe them. However, when the brothers continued to tell their story, and Yakov saw the <i>agalos &#8211; </i>the wagons that Yosef sent to carry him down to Egypt the Pasuk tells us: <i>vat’chi ruach Yaakov Avihem </i>– Yaakov’s spirit was revived and invigorated. He was so much <i>b’simcha</i> that he was even ready for <i>nevuah</i>.</p>
<p>One cannot help but wonder, why didn’t Yaakov believe the <em>Shevatim</em> from the moment they reported the momentous news of Yosef’s survival? And why did the <i>agalos</i> revive Yaakov’s spirit?<span id="more-6659"></span> Lev Eliyahu explains that Yakov Avinu, upon hearing the declaration of his 11 sons – including Binyamin, had no doubt that Yosef was physically alive. What he could not believe was that <i>od Yosef </i><b><i>Chai</i></b>&#8211; that the spiritual essence of Yosef <b><i>Hatzadik</i></b> had survived after so many years away from his father and his family. Could the leader of Egypt be a frum Jew? Couldn’t be, thought Yaakov Avinu. After all, one cannot ascend to such a powerful position without a compromise of religious values and practice. Though he was happy to hear the news that Yosef was still physically alive, <i>vayafeg libo</i> Yaakov’s felt faint. He now feared not the loss of Yosef but of Yosef <i>Hatzadik!</i> His soul shuddered at the thought that his righteous son had been corrupted by the depravity of Egyptian society. The brothers tried to convince Yakov otherwise, but Yakov would not accept it. To Yakov it was impossible—until he saw the wagons that Yosef sent for him.</p>
<p>Chazal tell us that Yosef sent <i>Agalos</i> to hint to his father of the topic they had been studying 22 years earlier, the laws of <i>Egla Arufa</i>. Yosef anticipated his father&#8217;s concern and knew that if he could demonstrate to his father that he was still immersed in Torah, his father wouldn&#8217;t be disappointed, nor would he suspect that Yosef had <i>chas v’shalom</i> deviated from the Torah&#8217;s way. Indeed, as a result, <i>vat’chi ruach Yaakov Avihem</i>. Yaakov’s spirit was rejuvinated.</p>
<p>We learn from this a powerful message of how one should never underestimate nor diminish the importance of parents and children learning together. Even after twenty-two years it was the bond of Talmud Torah between father and son that gave life meaning to both Yakov and Yosef. It is a bond that lasts forever and it is never too late to start!</p>

It went from Facebook, to the blogs, to the mainstream media and back again. And for good reason. The photo showed a softer side of the NYPD and a human side to homelessness.</p>
<p>As the rabbi at the Shul on the Beach in Venice, I encounter homelessness on a regular basis. There are many heroes and many villains in the homelessness narrative. But seeing the same people day in and day out and then one day never seeing them again, really humanizes the abstract issue of homelessness.</p>
<p>Apparently, the homeless fellow is bootless again. This is a typical homelessness cycle and I think adds an important footnote to the story.</p>
<p>For me, the image of an NYPD officer kneeling down next the homeless fellow in need evoked the feelings of another photo.<span id="more-6568"></span></p>
<p>My great-great-grandfather was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elyah_Lopian" target="_blank">R&#8217; Elya Lopian</a>. This saintly man who was a giant Torah scholar who was even more well known for his outstanding character, was captured in this iconic photo. Already an elderly man, R&#8217; Elya was known to leave bowls of milk for the neighborhood stray cats. It is striking to see the concern and compassion of a true <em>gadol. </em>Normally we associate great rabbis with Torah scholarship and intellectual or spiritual prowess. R&#8217; Elya possessed all that, but above this he was a beautiful human being. This photo captures his greatness.</p>
<p>I am proud to carry his name as my own and share this photo with you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4559" title="images" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/images-300x127.jpg?resize=300%2C127" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>The orthodox Jewish world is in tumult over the recent essays published by a local Los Angeles rabbi. <strong>Rabbi Yosef Kanefsky</strong> wrote a series of blog posts in varying tones explaining why he is unwilling to say the blessing where men thank God for not making them women. The exact text of the blessing reads: <em>Blessed are You, Lord our G-d, Master of the world, who did not create me a Woman.</em></p>
<p>This blessing comes from the <em>Talmud</em> quoting the <em>Tosefta</em>. It has been part of Jewish liturgy for nearly 2000 years. Any tradition, be it religious or not, that has that kind of cachet cannot be discarded willy nilly.</p>
<p>Indeed, Rabbi Kanefsky justified his position by articulating something that many have felt when reciting or hearing this blessing: <em>by its plain meaning, and by the simple smell test, it has the effect today of justifying our lack of progress, and of affirming for us that women do not possess the spiritual dignity than men do.</em></p>
<p>There has been a very strong response from more traditionalist orthodox rabbis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/" target="_blank">One blog</a> has dedicated no less than four of its 28 blog posts in August to distancing itself from Rabbi Kanefsky and either by association, implication or explicitly tossed Rabbi Kanefsky out of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>There is much to say on this topic and much has already been said. My purpose in this blog post will be to deal with two separate issues. They could just as easily have their own independent blog posts. But I prefer one landing place for both of these issues.</p>
<p>The first issue relates to the actual blessing in question.</p>
<p>The second issue relates to the response from the traditionalists.<span id="more-4550"></span></p>
<h2><strong>The Blessing</strong></h2>
<p>It was 11 years ago that Senator Joe Lieberman famously said on Imus in the Morning that he does not say this blessing. My less than 20 year old brain was met with the tension between tradition and modernity. I decided then that it was necessary to understand the blessing and what it meant.</p>
<p>There are several apologist explanations for the blessing. They all basically say something along the lines of women are really on a higher level than men, they don&#8217;t need to do as many commandments, they can if they want, but they don&#8217;t have to, men need the commandments to lift men out of the abyss, the blessing recognizes that men are appreciative for having those commandment to elevate them and thanks God for that opportunity. It is not insulting to women because it is not about who is better, it is about appreciating having more commandments.</p>
<p>While this is somewhat enticing, it falls short. The next logical step is that if the commandments are not indicative of higher status rather lower status, why are we blessing God for that? Could it be that it is something like tziduk ha&#8217;din &#8211; thanking God for the bad as we do after a death?  Unlikely. The other morning blessings do not follow this form.</p>
<p>Further, there are several medieval sources that actually say that the blessing is to thank God for for not making man a woman because women are not as special as men. It is certainly a viable explanation for the blessing. As I have written previously, I don&#8217;t blame the rabbis of the Talmud for thinking that way &#8211; if they did. They were subject to the social values of their era.</p>
<p>Chief Rabbi Lord <strong>Jonathan Sacks</strong> offers this explanation:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;&#8230;they are acknowledgments of the special responsibilities of Jewish life. Heathens, slaves and women are exempt from certain commandments that apply to Jewish men. In these blessings, we express our faith that the commandments are not a burden but a cherished vocation&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em></em>In other words, the blessing is an affirmation that extra commandments are a privilege. Well, why doesn&#8217;t everyone have this privilege?</p>
<p>It is easy to see why the blessing is an affront to many women. It implies inferiority at worst or less opportunity at best. It could be argued that just because Judaism has some specific roles for men and women does not mean it deserves a blessing to that effect. I completely understand why some find it offensive.</p>
<p>Rabbi Kanefsky&#8217;s feelings about the blessing are justified. His actions are what are subject to scrutiny. His feelings are not.</p>
<p><em>(Here is what I think about the blessing: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/01/11/apropos-of-nothing-well-maybe-something-rabbi-julie-schonfeld-edition/" target="_blank">Apropos of Nothing</a>)</em></p>
<h2><strong>The Response</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Rabbi Shafran</strong> takes a strong stance against Rabbi Kanefsky. Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s approach to orthodox Judaism is that things are not supposed to change. Commitment to orthodox Judaism and its <em>mesorah</em> mean accepting the status quo and not changing anything. In his mind, not saying the blessing is a change and simply because Rabbi Kanefsky is &#8220;big enough&#8221; to impose a change in orthodox Jewish liturgy, he can&#8217;t. Not only that, but making such a change is enough to push Rabbi Kanefsky out of orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>The punchline:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But when a contemporary rabbi, particularly one who has not yet garnered the wisdom that comes with many years of living and learning, proposes to reject an element—any element—of the Jewish mandate, there can be no question about his having relinquished the right to call himself Orthodox.</em></p>
<p><em></em>Speaking of change, a friend of mine put Rabbi Shafran&#8217;s opinion in perspective. The biggest innovation in the history of orthodox Judaism is that there is no innovation in orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>This is especially true with regard to liturgy.</p>
<p>In orthodox Judaism there are three primary <em>nuschaos</em> (prayer styles). They all follow a basic formula but transferring from one to the next is a difficult proposition. There are enough words, sentences and paragraphs that would make it uncomfortable for one who prays using nusach A to lead the services for a nusach B congregation.</p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>Simple. Different communities felt different prayers were important enough to incorporate into their services. Some did. Some didn&#8217;t. Over hundreds of years some prayers were added, others were deleted.</p>
<p>In the Aleinu prayer a line was taken out because it was offensive to the non-Jewish community. Some have said it should be put back. Others leave it out. No harm; no foul.</p>
<p>My great-great-grandfather, Reb Elya Lopian, a Torah giant with impeccable credentials (the Brisker Rav said of him: He is what R&#8217; Yisrael Salanter had in mind when he created the Mussar movement) adjusted his personal prayers several ways. In the introduction to his classic work, Lev Eliyahu, we are told that Reb Elya did not say &#8220;<em>ki shem Hashem ekra</em>&#8230;&#8221; before his Mincha amida, When Reb Elya would lead the services on the High Holidays he would omit the line &#8220;<em>hineni he&#8217;ani mi&#8217;maas nir&#8217;as v&#8217;nifhad</em>&#8230;&#8221; because he felt it was not honest. He felt he wasn&#8217;t really afraid so he just skipped it. Reb Elya also changed the words of &#8220;<em>Elokai nitzor l&#8217;shoni</em>&#8221; into &#8220;<em>Elokeinu nitzor l&#8217;shonenu</em>&#8221; because he felt that the author of the prayer was honestly trying his hardest to avoid the things mentioned in the prayer, but we don&#8217;t necessarily try our hardest so how could we ask God to do it for us? Instead Reb Elya switched the words to be general prayer on behalf of everyone.</p>
<p>I have been told, although I can&#8217;t find it in the book, that on Tisha B&#8217;Av Reb Elya even omitted the references to Jerusalem being desolate and destroyed. His reasoning was how could he say those words when they were no longer true?</p>
<p>In short, prayer for Reb Elya was an exercise in truth and honesty. The rigidity of the words in his prayer book were not impenetrable barriers to be accepted without careful consideration.</p>
<p>There is precedent for changing prayers and adjusting the liturgy based on many factors.</p>
<p>Of course Rabbi Shafran knows this. His problem with Rabbi Kanefsky is two-fold. One, he is not &#8220;<em>choshuv</em>&#8221; enough to make changes. Two, Rabbi Shafran makes that disingenuous claim that orthodox Judaism does not change.</p>
<p>As to the first claim: This is a classic ad hominem attack. If the change is valid, the source of the change is irrelevant. Very weak argument by Rabbi Shafran.</p>
<p>As the second claim: The entire concept is a lie. Things do change, especially in the liturgy.</p>
<p>Rabbi Shafran, and anyone else for that matter, would be taken much more seriously if he would make an actual argument against the change other than &#8220;we don&#8217;t change&#8221;. Does he have such an argument? I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>What does Rabbi Shafran really mean to say?</p>
<p>I think he means to say that changes that were made in the past were either needed, necessary or important enough to make. <em>This change is not</em>. In his opinion, the sensitivities of women who find this blessing offensive are not sufficient to warrant a change to the liturgy.</p>
<p>This is fair position. He can say it is not important enough <em>and others can disagree.</em> But by drawing the lines as he did, there is no room for discussion. One side is presenting halachic analysis and reasoning. The other is just closing its ears and saying &#8220;I can&#8217;t hear you&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think the way forward is to have a genuine discussion about the liturgy. Tossing your opponent out of orthodoxy doesn&#8217;t make the issue disappear nor does it win any argument.</p>
<p>As always, debate and discourse will provide the best way to analyze the issue and give orthodox Jews the tools they need to make the most appropriate informed decision for themselves.</p>

<p>This week we read Parshas Beha&#8217;aloshca. Aside from being the most difficult parsha to transliterate a bit of trivia is present. The famous verse &#8220;Vayihi b&#8217;nsoa ha&#8217;aron&#8221; is found in the parsha and in the sefer Torah (and most Chumashim) it is surrounded by an upside down letter nun. One upside down nun before the verse and one upside down nun is after the verse. This strange phenomena needs some explanation.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like in a Sefer Torah:<span id="more-2486"></span></p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-5423" href="http://finkorswim.com/?attachment_id=5423"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5423" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.frumsatire.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/nunhafucha.jpg?resize=462%2C108" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The Talmud in Shabbos (116a) explains that the verse does not belong here. It is out of place. It really belongs when the Israelite camps made their first journey in parshas Bamidbar however it is in our parsha instead. The reason it is found here is to separate between two negative stories.</p>
<p>The rishonim are all bothered by this reasoning. There is nothing negative that directly precedes the upside down nuns! What does the gemara mean?</p>
<p>The negative story that follows the upside down nun is fairly obvious. In fact there are two negative stories taht occur back to back following the upside down nun. First there were the misoninim who were consumed in a heavenly fire and then the next set of complainers were not happy with the steady diet mon, they wanted a variety of food. The Ramban quotes the gemara that says that the negative story that precedes the upside nun is the verse that says &#8220;vayisu mehar sinai&#8221; (and they left Mt. Sinai). The Ramban explains that byb saying they &#8220;left&#8221; it connotes the feeling a child has when school is over. They slam their books closed pack up their backpacks and run out the door before they can get a new assignment. Similarly, Klal Yisrael did not want any more mitzvos so they &#8220;got out of Dodge&#8221; as quickly as they could. Clearly, this reflects a very negative attitude among the Jewish people. Therefore, the chumash interrupts the narrative to break up the fleeing of Mt. Sinai and the negative stories of the misoninim and the mon complainers.</p>
<p>But why? Who cares if there are 3 consecutive negative stories?</p>
<p>The Ramban says that we break up the narrative so that there is no chazaka or status quo of negativity. In Torah law there is a concept of muchzakos. Applied here, when one acts a certain way 3 consecutive times, <em>that</em> type of behavior becomes the default. We don&#8217;t want the default to be negative behavior. Therefore the Torah interrupts the negative behavior with vayihi b&#8217;nsoah.</p>
<p>I think that this is important. Behaviors can become second nature. My great great grandfather, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elyah_Lopian" target="_blank">Reb Elya Lopian</a> taught that sometimes second nature is <em>harder</em> to change than our real nature. Once we &#8220;learn&#8221; a behavior it becomes so natural that it is more difficult to break away from that behavior than it is to change our natural behavior. Habit can be a toxic thing. The Torah reminds us here that negative behavior is bound to occur. We just cannot make a habit out of negative behavior.</p>
<p>There is also a great comfort in knowing that just as our negative behavior can become second nature, our positive behavior can as well. When we string together 3 consecutive acts of good behavior, those good behaviors can also become habits. Those are really good habits. It can be hard to try to adopt a new behavior or characteristic into our lives, but if we can pull it off just 3 times in a row, we can make it a habit and it will become second nature to be great.</p>

Part of a weekly Dvar Torah (Torah &#8220;Thought&#8221;) series.</span></em></p>
<h2>Parshas Achrei Mos &#8211; Kedoshim</h2>
<h2>V’lo Sissa Alav Cheit</h2>
<p>Parshios Achrei Mos and Kedoshim are chock full of mitzvos bein adam l’chaveiro and bein adam l’Makom. So many opportunities for making Hakadosh Baruch Hu proud leap off the pages of these parshiyos providing us the opportunity to earn Olmei Olamim. One of the most formidable opportunities to earn our eternal reweard is the mitzvah of tochacha. This command is often misunderstood, yet at the same time it is a vital responsibility of each and every member of Klal Yisrael. Let us explore it further.<span id="more-2419"></span></p>
<p>The pasuk teaches hocheach tocheach es amisecha, that we are supposed to offer rebuke, or criticism, to our fellow Jew. The Rambam in Hilchos De’os 6:7 explains the mitzvah as follows, ha’roeh chaveiro sh’chatah o’sheholoch b’derech lo tova mitzvah l’hachzeiro l’mutav u’lhodeahu shu choteh al atzmo b’maasav haraim shenemar hocheach tocheach es amisehca. According to the Rambam, when one sees his friend err, or slide down a slippery slope of destructive behavior, the mitzvah is l’hachzerio l’mutav, to help him return to goodness. Interestingly, the mitzvah is not to shout and yell criticisms, angry words or loud arguments, rather, the mitzvah is to help the individual accomplish a turn-around. It is not the rebuke that is important it is the result! As such, sometimes it is better to keep quiet, as the Gemara in Yevamos teaches, “words that can be accepted  should be said and words which will be rejected should be left unsaid.”</p>
<p>Reb Elya Lopian in Lev Eliyahu expands this further by explaining that before one can give tochacha he must fully love the person he is being mocheach. Without the sense of ahava for the one being criticized, the tochacha will not be effective. As such, being a mocheach is a high-stakes responsibility. To be effective, one must first rid their heart of any animus towards the individual whose behavior needs redirection. Moreover, the mocheach has to understand what is motivating the individual to err and what might motivate him to change. This way he can successfully explain to the wayward individual why he is hurting himself through the pursuit of the path he is taking.</p>
<p>With such a requirements for love, understanding and motivation inherent in the mitzvah of tochacha, being a mocheach requires much thought and advance planning. One must consider which approach will work  what words to use and what not to say. The serious mochiach must consider which actions will enable the object of his tochacha to be machzir l’mutav. As such tochacha is not just a mitzvah, it is an art form. Just like the painter draws lines and lays foundations of color in the initial stages of his drawing, so too, to create a masterpiece on the canvas of tochacha requires patience, time and a plan.</p>
<p>Mifarshei hamikrah point out that the mitzvah of tochacha is followed be the phrase v’lo sisa eilav cheit. Most mepharshim explain this to mean that we should not judge or embarrass a person who has sinned. However, master mochechim understand the pasuk differently. There is a command for us to give tochacha and to do it in the right way. V’lo sisa eilav cheit is to remind us to do our homework to love, understand and prepare a proper tochacha. A rebuke given wrongly will only reinforce the sin and make it that much harder to undo. Thus we are admonished to give tochacha, with the double lashon of hocheach-tocheach telling us to do it properly, v’lo sisa eilav cheit – and you will not foster further sin, for by offering improper tochacha we risk reinforcing the aveira even further!</p>
<p>Yes, getting it right requires a plan and patience and being machzir a chotei limutav is worth of all of that effort.</p>
