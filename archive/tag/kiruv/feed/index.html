				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This essay was written on October 8, 2013. It was never published. I think it&#8217;s still perfectly relevant.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey/" target="_blank">The Pew report</a> confirmed what many Jewish people already knew. Non-Orthodox Judaism is in crisis. According to Professor Stephen M. Cohen over 75% of non-Orthodox Jews are intermarried. About 43% of children of intermarriage consider themselves Jewish. The numbers are devastating and religious leaders are scrambling for solutions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, despite doomsday predictions from the 20th century, the Orthodox Jewish data demonstrates strength and viability. Almost 0% of Orthodox Jews intermarry and over 80% of Orthodox Jews between the age of 19 and 29 stay orthodox.</p>
<p>Some people think this is cause for celebrating Orthodox triumph. Other Orthodox Jews think that Orthodox Jews must step up outreach efforts to bring non-Orthodox Jews into the fold of Orthodox Judaism.</p>
<p>I think there is a third approach.<span id="more-9291"></span></p>
<p>Professor Cohen suggested that <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/editorial-opinion/editorial/losing-our-faith">Orthodox Jews and non-Orthodox increase their social ties</a>. Both groups believe that the other is not interested, but that needs to change.</p>
<p>I agree with Professor Cohen. As it stands right now, Orthodox Jews are enjoined from participating in inter-denominational activities and groups as per a nearly unanimous rabbinic ruling of the generation&#8217;s greatest Torah authorities in the middle of the 20th century. But there is a price to this ruling. The price is very clear boundaries between fellow Jews. Sociologically this has the negative effect of preventing cross-pollination of ideas. Non-orthodox Jews get little access to the vibrancy and beauty of Jewish traditions and practices that are found in Orthodox Judaism.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9293" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/puzzle-pieces-852x500.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="puzzle-pieces-852x500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The context that non-Orthodox Jews have the greatest interaction with Orthodox Jews is <em>&#8220;kiruv.&#8221;</em> But this is not the same as creating social ties that breach the gates of the self imposed ghetto. This is interaction for the purpose of eliciting a specific desired result. I am suggesting interaction for the sake of interaction. Social ties with no strings attached won&#8217;t limit the interactions to potential <em>kiruv</em> candidates and will more likely be institutionally accepted by the non-Orthodox.</p>
<p>A <em>kiruv</em> relationship is one where the Orthodox Jew wants something for the non-Orthodox Jew. But the non-Orthodox Jew may not want the same thing. Even if the non-Orthodox Jew eventually comes to desire the same thing the Orthodox Jew wants, the relationship began as an uneven partnership. The two parties had different goals. The desired outcome is different for each party. The Orthodox  Jew wants the non-Orthodox to adopt an Orthodox lifestyle and the non-Orthodox Jew might simply want a friend. The best relationships are mutually beneficial and are created as balanced partnerships. Both parties have similar goals and aspirations for the relationship. They agree on the hopeful outcome. Orthodox and non-Orthodox Jews must create these kinds of social ties. Friendship for the sake of the friendship.</p>
<p>This is aside from the obvious benefit increased intra-denominational activity will have on Jewish unity.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.faithstreet.com/onfaith/2013/10/03/can-liberal-judaism-survive" target="_blank">In an article published by OnFaith</a>, Rabbi David Wolpe suggested that liberal Judaism must embrace rituals in order to survive.<em> &#8220;Wearing Tefillin, praying in Hebrew, Torah study, Kashrut, Jewish communal adherence and activities — these things (while not necessarily limited only to Jews) are activities that keep the core of the tradition alive.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Rituals create a common language and uniquely Jewish experiences. Jews with these collective experiences as part of their religious identity will want to perpetuate these rituals in their family lives. This increases the desirability of marrying Jewish. It&#8217;s not simply tribalism or religious mandate. It&#8217;s a self-interested choice to pass on uniquely Jewish experiences to one&#8217;s children.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s the point of all these rituals? What benefit is there to the non-Orthodox Jew? This is a question that Orthodox Jews are adequately positioned to answer.</p>
<p>Who better than Orthodox Jews to impart the wisdom of these rituals? What better way is there to demonstrate the value in these rituals than the people who do them on a regular basis? It need not be for the purpose of proselytization. It is simply an opportunity to better appreciate the role of rituals in Judaism.</p>
<p>If non-Orthodox Jews are interested in learning about rituals, the Orthodox Jewish community is uniquely poised to step in and create mutually beneficial relationships with non-Orthodox Jews. Now we can honestly say that we are interested in the same outcome. We have an opportunity to create balanced, even friendships. We all want the same thing. This can stimulate increased social ties between all Jews.</p>
<p>Hopefully, non-Orthodox Jews will heed Rabbi Wolpe&#8217;s call and trend toward adding more traditional rituals to their observance. After all, this is a major key to Jewish continuity.</p>
<p>Even among formerly Orthodox Jews who have made the choice to leave Orthodox Judaism, many find that some rituals are worth perpetuating. Most end up marrying fellow Jews. I suspect that this has a lot to do with common experiences and a bit of nostalgia toward their Judaism. That can be replicated within the non-Orthodox Jewish community as well.</p>
<p>The Orthodox Jewish community cannot afford to let this opportunity slip through its fingers either. It is time we adjust our goals and reach across the aisle for the sake of friendship and <strong>mutually agreed upon goals</strong>.</p>
<p>I ask Orthodox and non-Orthodox rabbis and leaders to consider the price of denominational isolation. I ask my Jewish brethren to consider the price of our failure to communicate to one another. We are all in this together. Let&#8217;s act like it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/shmuly-yanklowitz-why-this-rabbi-is-swearing-off-kosher-meat-1401404939" target="_blank">opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal</a>, the world read that Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz &#8220;cannot pretend anymore that kosher meat, poultry and dairy is any healthier or ethical than nonkosher food.&#8221; Long before Rabbi Shmuly wrote this article in the WSJ he was a vegetarian. Nothing has actually changed in his eating habits as a result of this epiphany but it&#8217;s still interesting to hear what he has learned over the years. I guess.</p>
<p>The problem with this article is not that it airs dirty laundry in public or that some of the facts about slaughter are imprecise. Those are allegations that have been made, but there is a much more severe problem with the article. Why did Rabbi Shmuly ever pretend that kosher meat, poultry and dairy is any healthier or ethical than non kosher food in the first place?<span id="more-8471"></span></p>
<p>We have no idea why the Torah commands us to observe the laws of kashrut. Any attempt to assign specific reasons to the mitzvot in the Torah is pure speculation. The Sefer HaChinuch famously provides moral and religious lessons for each commandment. But in his introduction he makes certain that the reader knows that his ideas are just suggestions to make Torah life more meaningful. He is not stating that these are the reasons God commanded us to observe these laws. <img src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Ethics-Graphic.jpg?fit=600%2C600" alt="Ethics Graphic" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8473" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Further, several reasons are provided for keeping kosher and nothing have any relationship to ethics and a small minority connect kashrut to physical health. The most common thread between the various opinions of the speculative benefits of keeping kosher is spiritual health, not physical health. But none of the interpretations I have seen say anything about ethics.</p>
<p>Whoever taught Rabbi Shmuly that kosher had anything to do with ethics made a severe error. Not only did one person find this teaching hypocritical, but this caused that person to publicized this teaching as if it were truth and then demonstrated that Orthodox Jews are not keeping kashrut properly because there are ethical concerns. Truly unfortunate.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t know why we keep kashrut. Teaching one reason as the reason can yield dastardly results. Outreach organizations need to be so careful with the way they teach the moral lessons of Torah. I&#8217;ve heard too many anecdotes of well intentioned people creating serious problems for their students later on in their lives. Unless the Torah tells us why we were given a mitzvah, we cannot say with confidence that we know what the objective is for any mitzvah. Every time we speak of the rationale or benefit of mitzvot, we are in the area of art, not science. It&#8217;s philosophy, not law. It&#8217;s conjecture, not dogma.</p>
<p>When it comes to kashrut, there are plenty of wonderful lessons to be learned. There may even be lessons about ethics. But food that is prepared unethically is still legally kosher. There is no law that states otherwise. Kashrut is binary. It either is, or it isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>However, the Torah does demand that we treat animals with kindness and respect. Animal cruelty may not render something nonkosher, but it still violates a severe prohibition in the Torah. Are kosher slaughterhouses possibly playing with fire? Absolutely. They have an obligation to treat the animals well and we are responsible to apply the social pressure so that they will conform. But the food is kosher even if they treat the animals poorly as long as they do not render the animal legally nonkosher.</p>
<p>The Torah and the Prophets exhort us to act ethically and morally even when the other laws of the Torah are not being violated. Nachmanides even has a moniker for one who keeps the laws of the Torah but acts unethically and immorally. One is called a <em>&#8220;naval b&#8217;rshut haTorah&#8221;</em> &#8211; &#8220;a depraved person who acts within Torah law.&#8221; It&#8217;s possible to be such a person. But that does not make it right. It&#8217;s possible to provide unethical kosher food, that does not make it right, but the food is still kosher. One has nothing to do with the other.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the Agunah problem. People are often outraged that the Torah &#8220;allows&#8221; a recalcitrant husband to harm his estranged wife by withholding the get. As I remarked <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/07/answering-the-most-difficult-question-about-the-agunah-crisis/" target="_blank">in a previous article</a>, the Torah does not allow that at all. The Torah merely does not make it part of divorce law. But a Torah abiding Jew is required to be a kind and moral person at all times. Withholding a get violates several other laws in the Torah. According to divorce law the husband can be a jerk. But according to Torah law, he may not.</p>
<p>We have mitzvot and verses like:</p>
<p>&#8220;Love your neighbor like yourself.&#8221; &#8211; Lev. 19:17<br />
&#8220;Do not oppress a stranger.&#8221; &#8211; Ex. 23:9<br />
&#8220;Justice justice you shall pursue.&#8221; &#8211; Deut. 16:20</p>
<p>And the collection of prohibitions and laws against Tzaar Baalei Chaim &#8211; causing pain to living beings.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that we are precise with our explanations of Torah, mitzvot, and Jewish law. Kashrut and divorce law only inform us of the procedures and obligations specific to their areas of law. But that does not mean we are permitted to forget about the moral and ethical admonitions found throughout the rest of our law and tradition. The laws of the Torah work together to cultivate a good, moral society. But each commandment is not independently ethical or moral. There is a system and all the parts play a role. We are miserable failures if the Torah life we teach opens the door for <em>&#8220;naval b&#8217;rshut haTorah&#8221;</em>. We can do better and we should demand better. But it&#8217;s not because of the laws of kashrut or divorce. It&#8217;s because that&#8217;s what the Torah and the Prophets demand from us.</p>

It comes on the heels of two consecutive Klal Perspectives Journal issues on kiruv. He even quotes one article from KP.</p>
<p>First of all, Wertheimer gets kiruv and he gets the issues it creates. I commend him for writing an article as outsider while somehow grasping many of the nuances of kiruv in the orthodox Jewish world. It was very well done. I was impressed. That being said, he does make a few points that don&#8217;t pass the smell test.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the good observations. First, the article combines Chabad outreach and &#8220;everyone else&#8221;. I am not sure that makes sense. Chabad mostly functions independently of the rest of orthodox Judaism, especially in kiruv. Wertheimer comments that Chabad is sometimes viewed disparagingly by the non-Chabad orthodox Jews and even by the non-kiruv Chabad community. So while the numbers of of kiruv workers are staggering if one includes Chabad, it&#8217;s not so clear that they should be included in the same category as everyone else. Aside from the differences in perspective and allegiances, Chabad outreach is not always outreach, Wertheimer notes. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a service. Is a public service the same as kiruv? Maybe. But many non-Chabad people would say it is not.</p>
<p>The article proposes that the large number of kiruv workers is partially a result of more orthodox Jews who need jobs. This is true. For some people, kiruv is a paycheck. This might explain some of the diminished returns. The numbers in the 1990&#8217;s were higher than they are now. When it was a &#8220;calling&#8221; one could expect more success. Now it is just a job for a lot of people. That might make a difference.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about the article for me was that Wertheimer claims that in confidence non-Chabad kiruv workers told him that they consider it a success even if a prospect does not become orthodox.</p>
<p><span id="more-6894"></span></p>
<p>It is a success even if the prospect is more likely to attend a conservative or reform service. This surprised me. It does not reflect my experience. But while I concede that kiruv workers may be satisfied with that kind of return, their donors are not. Wertheimer notes that donors expect a greater return on their investment. &#8220;<em>Donors are increasingly linking their largesse to quotas: One funder insists that each campus outreach worker must reel in at least seven college students annually. Not surprisingly, these pressures have resulted in creative bookkeeping — and demoralization when unrealistic goals cannot be met.&#8221; </em> I alluded to this in my kiruv article as well. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/28/a-different-kiruv-paradigm/">A Different Kiruv Paradigm</a>)</p>
<p>Werheimer&#8217;s estimated numbers are staggering. He estimates that the &#8220;<em>collective impact of Orthodox outreach may touch between a half million and 700,000 Jews each year, rivaling the impact of the Conservative and Reform movements, and in the majority of cases complementing and enhancing the work of those important movements. </em>To think that we have that kind of influence among the other denominations is incredible.</p>
<p>He goes through some of the tension between orthodox kiruv workers and non-orthodox rabbis as well. One thing I had not thought of was the free Bar Mitzvah lessons and free admission to services on the High Holidays severely cutting into the bottom line of conservative and reform congregations. This is an area that needs to be addressed. We cannot cannibalize non-orthodox institutions.</p>
<p>Also mentioned is the questionable practices of using chicanery or smooth-talking to bait kiruv prospects. It&#8217;s deplorable and he could have spent even more time on it.</p>
<p>Further, the article notes that kiruv is not really a great match for today&#8217;s insular frum communities. He quotes the excellent article by Rabbi Ilan Feldman in Klal Perspectives. <em>“To effectively inspire people to become observant, the effort must be done in isolation from the established Orthodox community,” Rabbi Ilan Feldman laments. “Frum communities as cultures are simply not conducive to outreach.”</em> This is lamentable, but true. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/20/one-excellent-article-from-the-new-klal-perspectives-kiruv-issue/">One Excellent Article From Klal Perspectives Fall 2012 on Kiruv</a>)</p>
<p>The article concludes on a hopeful note. Wertheimer hopes that the ad hoc collaboration of kiruv with non-orthodox institutions can bolster American Jewry. <em>&#8220;The American Jewish community can rely upon a new resource to complement existing religious movements, synagogues, and educational institutions in their collective mission to inspire Jews of all ages to draw closer to their religious tradition.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>One thing that seemed improbable to me was the assertion that most kiruv success stories are formerly conservative Jews. My experience has been the complete opposite. That is, the <em>less </em>one knows about Judaism, the more likely one is to become frum. Conservative Jews are pretty educated and usually are passionate about their traditions. These are the people that are least likely to jump ship and go the orthodox route. Yet, for some reason Wertheimer asserts that they are the most likely. The entire article is devoid of footnotes. This is one area that the omission of footnotes is especially glaring. Perhaps Werhteimer&#8217;s conservative roots are coloring his perspective here.</p>
<p>But the most glaring issue to me was Wertheimer&#8217;s assumption that this is considered &#8220;working together&#8221;. He paints this whole thing as orthodox rabbis working <em>with </em>theconservative and reform movement. As if it&#8217;s some kind of partnership. I don&#8217;t agree. A partnership is where two groups work together. Kiruv can at best be viewed as supplementary. I think that calling it a partnership is a bit disingenuous at this point.</p>
<p>What are we to make of this article?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s remarkable that kiruv is such a huge industry that it is being written up in somewhat glowing terms by a conservative Jewish professor. The assumption has always been that kiruv is viewed as the enemy by non-orthodox Jews. It certainly did not feel that way reading Wertheimer&#8217;s article.</p>
<p>More importantly, an outsider who understands kiruv has some great advice. I think his criticisms must be considered.</p>
<p>But above all, I think we need to rethink the entire paradigm. We, as orthodox Jews, should be able to figure out a way to work together with the non-orthodox for real. Not just as supplements and not just as a safety net. We should be permitted and we should be able to partner in events and programs in which we share common goals. We should seek out such events and make them a priority. Wertheimer insinuates that orthodox Jews no longer view non-orthodox Jews as an enemy. This is only slightly true in some less insular quarters. But we can make it true for all orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, the war is over. No one is really deciding between orthodox Judaism and conservative or reform Judaism. Now the battle is all the denominations vs. secularism and apathy. We are on the same team now. It&#8217;s time to take kiruv to the next level and integrate with non-orthodox Jews for the sake of friendship and brotherhood. It can&#8217;t just be for the sake of kiruv. Those days are gone. Now it is time for real kiruv &#8211; closeness. A closeness for the pure sake of being close.</p>
<p>I think this article tells us that we can do just that. Now let&#8217;s do it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6714" src="http://i2.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/image_preview.jpeg?resize=300%2C261" alt="image_preview" data-recalc-dims="1" />Last week, the Fall 2012 issue of Klal Perspectives was released. I noted the excellent article written by Rabbi Ilan Feldman and recommended that everyone read it. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/12/20/one-excellent-article-from-the-new-klal-perspectives-kiruv-issue/">One Excellent Article From Klal Perspectives Fall 2012 on Kiruv</a>)</p>
<p>I mentioned at the time that I would attempt to address the issues raised in the journal.</p>
<p>Klal Perspective writers were asked to address three general questions. Some additional background is provided on the Klal Perspectives site. See here: <a href="http://klalperspectives.org/fall-2012/fall-2012-questions/">Klal Perspectives</a>. These are the three questions:</p>
<p>1. What are the most significant dimensions of current outreach efforts, and how effective are they?</p>
<p>2. In light of the various alternative objectives that may be pursued in conducting outreach, by what criteria is success measured? Are the prevailing measurements of success the appropriate measurements? Can results be reliably calculated? And how is the donor or volunteer able to ascertain which target demographic and which approach to kiruv enjoys the greatest realization and success?</p>
<p>3. Has kiruv in America runs its course due to the combination of (a) decades of assimilation that has diminished the number of accessible, non-observant Jews who are halachically Jewish, and (b) the rapidly diminishing sense of Jewish identity among younger, secular Jews? Or, do these factors mitigate in favor a more powerful outreach push, since in a decade or two it may be too late? And finally, what are the new frontiers in outreach that may yet be explored?</p>
<p>My response:<span id="more-6669"></span></p>
<p>Klal Perspectives did not define their terms when they asked for responses to their three questions. The questions are also very vague. As a result it is not easy to simply answer the three questions without making several assumptions. This article will not make any assumptions about definitions nor will it fill in the gaps of the vague questions.</p>
<p><b>I. Dimensions of Successful Kiruv</b></p>
<p>I don’t know what “the most significant dimensions of current outreach efforts” means so I can’t really answer that part of the question. I can’t answer how effective they are because I don’t know what is being discussed. I think the question might be asking in a roundabout way, what kind of kiruv is most effective. If that is what is being asked, the question is backwards.</p>
<p>In my experience, I have seen that kiruv is not a success or a failure depending on the group or sub-group that a particular kiruv professional is working with. Success is almost always dependent on the individual kiruv professional’s drive, talent, and commitment. In other words, focusing on the demographic is a huge error. A great kiruv professional will have success no matter the age, no matter the ethnicity, no matter the circumstances.</p>
<p>This is because kiruv is not about systems, or programs, or even content. Kiruv is about relationships and good sales.</p>
<p>The successful kiruv professional is an outstanding salesperson. An outstanding salesperson can sell to anyone. Put an excellent kiruv professional in any setting and the kiruv professional will be very successful. Therefore, trying to figure out which of our current kiruv efforts is most effective looks at the wrong side of the equation. It’s less about the pool of prospective kiruv candidates and much more about the person doing the kiruv.</p>
<p>It’s also about the product being sold. Some kiruv professionals sell the version of orthodox Judaism that is the simplest sell. It is often riddled with half-truths and late night television informercial promises. This might work for a short time, or even a long time, but ultimately it is a dangerous game. We don’t want to ensnare people into orthodox Judaism, we want people to be attracted to orthodox Judaism. The good salesperson with the hard sell might be very successful on the surface, but that kind of kiruv is just creating problems that will manifest later on. The best salesperson is honest, straightforward, and passionate. We have a great product. There is no need to puff it up like a used car salesperson. Again, success is less about the group being targeting and more about the sale.</p>
<p>Successful, long term kiruv requires relationships and a good, honest sell.</p>
<p><b>II. Measuring Success</b></p>
<p>This is the area of kiruv where I think I am the furthest from the mainstream. Millions of dollars are being poured into kiruv and there is an expectation of quantifiable results and success. This is generally measured as facilitating a move from non-<i>shmiras mitzvos</i> to <i>shmiras mitzvos</i>. At the very least it has been defined as “preventing an intermarriage.”</p>
<p>Most people who become <i>shomer mitzvos </i>do so as a result of many influences in their lives. The initial kiruv professional who introduced them to a nice frum family, the frum family that introduced them to the charismatic pulpit rabbi, the pulpit rabbi who sent them off the <i>yeshiva, </i>the rebbeim at the yeshiva who worked with them as beginners, the teachers of the more advanced tracks in the <i>yeshiva, </i>the family in <i>Eretz Yisrael </i>who took them into their home, the rabbi who counseled them after they started <i>shmiras mitzvos, </i>and the anonymous person who made a kiddush Hashem through their excellent character and was merely observed, are all people who can take “credit” for helping this person. Donors are likely seeing several parties “claim” each kiruv success story which makes definitive numbers even more elusive.</p>
<p>Further complicating matters, many organizations and communities have segmented their kiruv efforts as a result of applying business principles to kiruv. One group makes initial contact and inspires the potential kiruv candidate. Another group handles the potential kiruv candidate through the first stages of real kiruv. The next group pushes the potential kiruv candidate to study in yeshiva.</p>
<p>The problem is that when one is pushed through a system no one person in that system feels solely responsible for that person. Initially, this is not an issue as the system takes care of its people. But when the kiruv is done and the person returns from yeshiva, the people who placed the person along this exciting path of discovery and change are working on their next potential kiruv candidates. Compounding matters, the group that attracts new people to orthodox Judaism, and the group that cultivates that interest, and the group who push the potential kiruv candidate to yeshiva may be very, very good at what they do, but they may have no idea how to counsel and guide a baal teshuva. Too often, those who have become frum get terrible advice from the people who helped them find their Judaism in the first place. Then it is the community rabbis and others who are left to pick up the pieces. Sometimes the pieces can’t be put back together and we are left with a broken home, confused children, and resentment toward orthodox Judaism. Helping baalei teshuva is not necessarily the forte of kiruv workers, and even if it were something they could do, or wanted to do, they are busy finding the next group of potential kiruv candidates. Helping people who are already frum does not help their numbers anymore. The sale has been made. It’s time to move on.</p>
<p>It’s wrong to think that once someone is frum they won’t need a lot of guidance. Everything is new to them. What is second nature to those who are frum from birth has to be learned by those who are not. Family relationships must be managed and complicated questions of loyalty are often raised. Helping people who are already frum does not have the glamour of kiruv, but it is vital to the success of our kiruv efforts.</p>
<p>Using metrics to measure success and as a basis for funding has many advantages. It incentivizes efficiency, it gives kiruv professionals real goals, and it gives the donors reason to believe that their monies are being used wisely. There is a darker side to the metrics as well. Kiruv professionals run the risk of viewing kiruv candidates as numbers instead of looking at them as human beings. It also can harm efforts to help baalei teshuva once they return from yeshiva. But most importantly I think it has established a standard in kiruv that is simply wrong.</p>
<p>I disagree with the popular definition of kiruv. I don’t think that the goal of kiruv to facilitate one’s movement from non-<i>shmiras mitzvos</i> to <i>shmiras mitzvos</i>. I think that in order to foster a real relationship with another person, the foundation of the relationship must be truth. When I worked as a kiruv professional on college campuses students were often suspicious that the only reason I was being nice to them was because I wanted something from them. They reasoned to themselves that I was friendly because I hoped they would adopt my lifestyle. They assumed that the free things I was throwing at them had ulterior motives. Perhaps they thought I received a cash bonus for every Shabbos they kept. My employers, or maybe it was just their donors, wanted people to become frum and that’s why I was talking to them. They might have been right. But I did not want them to be right. So I worked very hard to make sure that I was genuinely concerned with their wellbeing. My exclusive interest and explicitly stated goal was to foster friendships. I was not selling anything. I was just making friends. I wanted these friends to become part of my life, my family, my community, and come to Israel with me when I took my college student friends on a trip to the Holy Land.</p>
<p>It was very important to me that I be able to look every single student in the eye and say “I just want to provide you with an opportunity for a relationship with an orthodox rabbi.” That’s all. That was my goal. It had to be my goal if I was going to be honest with everyone that I met. And I really wanted to be completely honest.</p>
<p>My employers and supporters wanted to see students becoming <i>shomrei Torah u’mitzvos </i>and so did I, most of the time. But that was not my goal. It was one of many possible outcomes that would result from a relationship. The relationship was my goal.</p>
<p>That experience has profoundly impacted the way I view kiruv. I think that the stated goal of kiruv should not be <i>shmiras mitzvos. </i>In my mind, the goal of kiruv is to “<b>provide positive Jewish experiences to the maximum number of people possible.</b>” This way I can be honest. This way I can be proud of providing those experiences. This way I can make my goals based on what I am doing and not the choices of others. I can provide the experience, I can make the experience positive. I cannot control what others will do as a result of those experiences. If one is inspired by the experience and wants to learn more, I am willing, ready, and able to help them along that path.</p>
<p>In my shul, we try to create positive Jewish experiences for the maximum number of people possible. This is our goal. I can say with certainty that we are very successful at achieving this goal. Every year, hundreds of people have positive Jewish experiences in my shul. Some of them are frum people, some of them are not yet frum, some of them will never be frum, but they all have positive Jewish experiences. (Parenthetically, I think this should be the goal of orthodox Jewish education for our own children and communities). Accomplishing this goal requires a community of people who are committed to this goal and an environment that accepts everyone without judgment. We do not allow non-orthodox Jews to step into a shul and feel like fresh kiruv candidate meat. They are not. We make sure that whoever steps into our shul feels the brotherhood of Judaism and that they too can find something special in their Judaism through our shul.</p>
<p>If the positive Jewish experience inspires someone to be a better person, albeit not a frum Jew, that is also a good thing. If the positive Jewish experience challenges a non-affiliated Jew to go to a Reform Temple or a Conservative Synagogue more often, that is also a success. If we make a kiddush Hashem because more people have favorable things to say about frum Jews and commitment to Torah, that is also a success.</p>
<p>We can’t tell potential kiruv candidates that they are only a “real” baal teshuva if they go to a certain type of yeshiva and end up wearing a black hat on Shabbos. I have heard too many examples of people involved with kiruv organizations hearing from their kiruv rabbis that modern orthodoxy is not an option. They hear that modern orthodoxy is just as bad, or as pointless as being Conservative or Reform. This is wrong on several levels. Modern orthodoxy need not be viewed as a compromise or lesser form of orthodox Judaism. It is not. Further, we can’t allow ourselves to perpetuate the myth that non-orthodox Jews are devoid of spirituality and commitment. This is simply untrue. There are orthodox Jews who are devoid of spirituality and commitment and there are non-orthodox Jews who are spiritually fulfilled and very committed to their brand of Judaism. Kiruv cannot be an all or nothing proposition. Kiruv is about creating relationships with people and it is about giving people positive Jewish experiences. Right wing orthodox Judaism is not for everyone and we must provide opportunities for people to grow Jewishly in many ways, not only by blossoming into one specific type of orthodox Jew.</p>
<p>Using a very narrow definition of kiruv and focusing on the numbers to determine success can potentially undermine these efforts. Most importantly, by changing our focus to a more holistic approach to kiruv, as a community we will be more conscious of the needs of those who are moving through the kiruv system as kiruv professionals will not be bogged down by pursuing numbers and kiruv won’t end after the sale has been made.</p>
<p><b>III. The Future</b></p>
<p>Kiruv has not run its course. It is just as important today as it was yesterday. It helps the frum community hone its message, but more importantly, it allows frum Jews and not frum Jews to interact. Interdenominational interaction is still taboo in the frum community. One of the few trapdoors we have into that world is our kiruv efforts. We need more of that, not less. Non-orthodox Jews are our family. There has been too much separation between us. We can no longer afford to cut off our nose to spite our face. Hopefully that will change for the better soon. But if the only way to maintain dialogue with our non-orthodox brothers and sisters is via kiruv, <i>dayenu</i>.</p>
<p>I think the future of kiruv is along the lines of the model I have suggested here. The future is providing orthodox Jewish experiences for the masses. These experiences will be without pretense and with no expectation of commitment. But the more people who are exposed to orthodox Judaism, the greater number of people who will find it attractive. There will always be people who want to live the beautiful life of committed, passionate orthodox Judaism. We want those who might find our lifestyle attractive to have the opportunity to discover as much as possible about orthodox Judaism. We want those who want to grow Jewishly through means other than orthodox Judaism to be inspired to do that. In the future, all passionate Jews will participate in this kind of kiruv; the denominational lines will be blurred as we are all partners in the future of the Jewish people.</p>
<p>I see the future of kiruv as a time where we are all working towards expanding our circles of Jewish relationships. It will be a time where positive Jewish experiences are the goal and we can measure success by the experience and not yeshiva enrollments.</p>
<p>There is reason to he hopeful that this model can become the standard. It will take restraint from the donors and careful hiring of the right kind of kiruv professionals. It can be done, it must be done, it will be done, and we will all be better for it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6654" alt="270209_reachingout" src="http://i1.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/270209_reachingout.jpg?resize=300%2C200" data-recalc-dims="1" />We&#8217;ve covered Klal Perspectives here before. I think we will follow the same format as we did last time. I am going to highlight the one good article that I read in the journal in this post. Hopefully next week I will write my response to the Questions in this Klal Perspectives issue.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Klal Perspectives, here is the intro from my post on the previous issue:</p>
<p><em>Klal Perspectives is a great journal of articles written by orthodox Jewish rabbis and writers. The difference between Klal Perspectives and other journals is basically the content. KP is not a halacha journal. It is a practical journal.</em></p>
<p><em>The articles are not about well researched, fine nuances of Jewish law. The articles are about the issues that the orthodox community is facing and how to deal with them. Because the articles are not academic, they appeal to more people and more people are capable of writing articles for the journal. In a pleasing development, several articles have been authored by women. Lay-people are also featured as writers.</em></p>
<p>The issue being handled in this issue is Kiruv. The questions are pretty specific but the goal is to discuss <em>&#8220;varying approaches to outreach currently being pursued, and the appropriateness of the current allocation of communal resources as among these alternative strategies and focuses.&#8221;<span id="more-6653"></span></em></p>
<p>The journal does not agree upon a definition for the word Kiruv but I think they generally define it as bringing non-orthodox Jews to mitzvah observance.</p>
<p>Honestly, the responses that I read were pretty depressing. The articles did not really answer the questions that they were asked to answer. This is somewhat typical of Kiruv in general, as the entire field is not really very into using data and statistics. There were barely any footnotes in the articles I read. To me, this means that the writers are writing from their hearts and minds, but not from a place of hard data. That&#8217;s fine, but it is qualitatively different than well researched writing. Most of the articles I read sounded more like sermons, or divrei Torah than journal articles. That&#8217;s also fine, but I think that reflects poorly on the Kiruv field. Yet, it rings true to my ears, in the sense that the Kiruv profession, for better or worse, is not really about data, numbers, efficiency of resources, or other more modern metrics.</p>
<p>None of the articles I read actually discussed the issues of proving God&#8217;s existence or the veracity of the Torah. One article acknowledged the challenges of Biblical Criticism, but said nothing about how to meet the challenge. It&#8217;s almost as if the Kiruv professionals who wrote articles are not aware that belief in God and Torah from Sinai is not as easy as it sounds. Perhaps, the reason Kiruv seems to be floundering is because we can&#8217;t get past first base!</p>
<p>One article stood out. Rabbi Ilan Feldman wrote more about the orthodox Jewish community than about Kiruv per se, but his observations are right on the money.</p>
<p>His basic point is that the success of orthodox Judaism actually harms Kiruv. Our communities are large, intimidating, and have become focused on observance above being what he calls &#8220;model communities&#8221;. We are more careful about chumros and precision in halacha and hashkafa that it detracts from our appeal. Further, our success permits untrue stereotypes about our non-orthodox comrades to develop and reach levels of acceptance that they are considered normal.</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman relates a powerful story about the time he joined a mission of Federation style Jews (read = non-orthodox) as a way of trying to build a bridge between the respective communities. Throughout the trip he had to make many sacrifices and concessions all while not getting offended by the ignorance of orthodox Judaism exhibited throughout the trip. By the end of the trip his trip-mates warmed up to him and they had great conversations while getting to know each other pretty well. He felt that he was successful in dispelling many of the unfair or erroneous assumptions about orthodox Judaism by going on the trip.</p>
<p>This is not an unfamiliar script. It happens all the time. But the part that hit home for me, and elicited a tear in the corner of my eye was this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>But the one who was most transformed on that trip was me.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>What I expected to encounter was a group of 200 Jews devoid of feelings for Israel or religion. What I discovered instead were 200 very religious, spiritual, passionately devoted, proud Jews who knew very little about Torah and who lacked a Jewish vocabulary, but who loved their Jewish brethren in Israel, respected holiness and possessed a passion for Judaism as they knew it that rivaled the passion I had seen in my frum friends. In short, I learned to respect them. And I learned that “secular” Jews are often very religious Jews who do not know ritual, and whose devotion and willingness to sacrifice for the Judaism they do know is inspiring. By the time we parted ways, I actually loved them. Once I made this discovery, I was both surprised and embarrassed that it was new to me.</em></p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is so true. In some orthodox circles, the non-orthodox are heathen, God hating, anti-Semites. This is a lie. Maybe part of why Kiruv has become so hard is because they know what we think of them&#8230;</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman then returns to the point about our communities focusing more on observance than being models. When combined with our arrogance about our own observance our ignorance about non-orthodox Jews creates this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Picture an emotionally and financially secure, successful, well-educated head of household who lives in a world in which wisdom is respected, volunteering over the weekend is considered a wonderful way to spend one’s time, wholesome family activities on Saturday afternoon are seen as a healthy way of building character. Ask him to join a world in which routine Shabbos-table talk argues in favor of Torah by disparaging secular wisdom, in which political candidates are assessed purely on selfish concerns of the religious community, with little concern for their impact on broader society. Not only is this sort of talk distinctly unattractive, it is not the talk of giants; it obscures the sense of responsibility, compassion and awe for G-d’s children that Avraham Avinu left as his legacy to his descendants.</em></p>
<p>Again. Wow.</p>
<p>But it is true. Orthodox Jews are led to believe that non-orthodox Jews and non-Jews are flailing about in the God-forsaken secular world. They are up the creek without a paddle. If only they would see the beauty of orthodox Judaism, they would be like thirsty camels drinking from the cool waters of our oasis of Torah. But that&#8217;s not the way it is. People are doing just fine without religion, and we are not always doing just fine with religion. We need to change how we view them and more importantly we need to change ourselves.</p>
<p>Rabbi Feldman offers a hopeful alternative vision.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Orthodox Jews would be sufficiently secure with their own Yiddishkeit to invite their neighbors and co-workers to their homes, because the language of fear will have been replaced by a language of connection and confidence. Orthodox Jews would lead lives of idealism that extend beyond their own religious needs, inevitably becoming role models and attractive examples of lifestyle to non-observant Jews. Families will make life decisions informed by the religious needs of Klal Yisrael, not exclusively their own. Young couples will be recognized as an invaluable resource in a battle for the spiritual lives of all Jews, and will be encouraged to choose where to reside based upon where their presence would most greatly enhance Judaism, rather than merely their own religious comforts.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Because Orthodoxy would authentically and profoundly respect people, Orthodox community leaders would develop a reputation for selfless devotion to the good of the broader community, rather than solely parochial interests. For example, communal leadership will be invested in ensuring strong public schools in their neighborhoods, even though their own constituencies attend only yeshivas.</em></p>
<p>Notice the subtle criticism of the orthodox establishment? I honestly think this criticism is spot on. But there is hope. In Rabbi Feldman&#8217;s opinion, with the proper attitudes in place, we become a more attractive destination for passionate Judaism among the non-orthodox. I agree. This is what it would look like:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Non-observant Jews will be welcomed by their frum neighbors in both large frum communities as well as in evolving frum neighborhoods, and frum Jews will be more than welcome into their neighborhoods by the non-Orthodox, eruv and all, because Orthodox people would be known to be ideal neighbors: friendly, non-judgmental, and interested in the needs of others.</em></p>
<p>We can dream, right?</p>

Nessie is in the hall of fame of mythological creatures alongside Bigfoot, Chupacabra, Kraken, Werewolves, and Vampires. Supposedly, Nessie lives in giant loch in Scotland. According to the legends, Nessie is a giant sea monster the likes of which are not known to scientists anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Rational people reject the existence of Nessie based on the lack of evidence that Nessie is real. The only &#8220;evidence&#8221; available is a few grainy photographs that could be just about anything, some anecdotes, legends, and faith. It is fair to say that belief in Nessie is irrational and not supported by science.</p>
<p>A Scottish Sailor named George Edwards claims to have the best photo of Nessie yet. This Edwards fellow has been chasing Nessie every day for 26 years. He thinks his photograph (see above) captures one of many Nessie sea monsters living in the Loch.</p>
<p>It is hard to see how this photo can be anything definitive. But I guess the eyes start playing tricks on you and your mind agrees with your eyes after a 26 year search.</p>
<p>What fascinated me more than anything about the article on Yahoo! was this section:<span id="more-6152"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Edwards has a lot of theories about the Loch Ness monster, which he first became fascinated with when he was a 13-year-old boy and his father would take him fishing at the massive lake. He says he was a skeptic at first, but decades on Loch Ness have turned him into an ardent believer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“I grew up with the legend, like the boogeyman, or Big Foot in your part of the world, and most people start out thinking it’s a myth,” Edwards said. “But Loch Ness is so deep and dark and mysterious, when you start hearing more and more stories, you start believing more.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">He says his wife, who has been with him since before he started searching for Nessie full time, was initially a skeptic too, but after years of hearing stories from her husband and others, “she came around, and she’s a believer now.”</p>
<p>What Edwards is saying is that a skeptic can become a believer if one is immersed in an environment conducive to that belief. Rationality and reason are not strong enough to prevail over immersion in a society where belief is central.</p>
<p>Ain&#8217;t that the truth&#8230;</p>
<p>As if the bring the point home, I noticed the post on Collive about the Atheist woman who became a devout Chabad chasid. Here is a woman who says that she was a devout Atheist. Science, reason, logic, and rationalism were her Gods. Then something clicked and she found her Creator and Tanya and Chabad. Now she is a Chabad chasid married to an aspiring Chabad rabbi.</p>
<p>What? How did this happen?</p>
<p>Well it happens all the time. Kiruv is pretty successful, especially on college campuses. I was part of it myself for a couple of years and some of my students are now orthodox. It&#8217;s not a strange story at all. Yet it seems improbable. How does it happen?</p>
<p>There are a lot of factors. Not the least of which is a yearning for a sense of belonging to a community that has what a lot of people are searching for. But yet, that can&#8217;t be enough to circumvent one&#8217;s firmly held beliefs about science and reason. Or can it?</p>
<p>I think Sailor Edwards has given us some really good insight into how this happens. If you are in an environment where everyone believes in something, and there is a payoff to that belief, it becomes much easier to believe. A skeptic can believe in Nessie, or an Atheist can believe in God and Torah and Judaism.</p>
<p>There is a huge difference between the two. I don&#8217;t think there is any value in believing in Nessie. I do think that there is a lot of value in believing in God.</p>
<p>One might argue that if belief runs counter to reason, why would it be wise or useful to place oneself in an environment conducive to belief? Isn&#8217;t that just fooling oneself into believing in God? My response is that many people <em>want </em>to believe. It is just <em>hard</em> to believe. If one wants to believe and they are conflicted about their beliefs, it is wise to do whatever one can do to reinforce those beliefs. Immersion in a community where belief is common and has a payoff seems to be a great solution.</p>
<p>The challenge of our generation of orthodox Judaism is belief. I think it is a legitimate struggle. One tool in the arsenal of the believer is to immerse oneself in a community of believers. We think our beliefs are legitimate. It worked for a sailor looking for an imaginary creature, it could work for those of us who are looking for our Creator.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TikkunOlam_3.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4492" title="TikkunOlam_3" src="http://i0.wp.com/finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/TikkunOlam_3.jpg?resize=300%2C276" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>In what has become a bit of a famous op-ed in on JTA.org, Joel Alperson, a non-orthodox Jew, has written a powerful call to arms for the non-orthodox communities.</p>
<p>I am orthodox, so his words apparently are not directed at me and my co-religionists. Or perhaps they are&#8230;</p>
<p>Alperson writes that Judaism for the non-orthodox has become too much about tikkun olam (social justice) and too little about building Jewish communities. He opines that in order to maintain a Jewish community, the focus of the community cannot be about social / political issues. It must be about religion. Tikkun olam must be an ingredient in modern Jewish life, but it cannot be the focus, lest we lose our direction completely and divest Judaism from all of its religious underpinnings.</p>
<p>He writes that Jewish education is more important than tikkun olam and the non-orthodox are losing their Judaism because of ignorance and complacency.<span id="more-4491"></span> In his view, Judaism, even if not orthodox, can help people become better people, for themselves, not just to help everyone else.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Judaism teaches us how to be better friends, businesspeople, husbands, wives and philanthropists. It tells us how to help the weak and when to fight evil. In short, Judaism done right makes us better human beings. It is the discipline of leading a traditional Jewish life that also reminds us how best to engage in repairing the world.</em></p>
<p>Of course, orthodox Jews have been saying this forever. We agree. Perhaps, this would give orthodox Jews a feather in the cap. We are winning. They know it. Tee-hee! Ding-dong the witch is dead!</p>
<p>But I think that orthodox Jews also have a role to play in this. In general, there are two ways that orthodox Jews view the non-orthodox: 1) persona non grata 2) kiruv prospect.</p>
<p>This is undertandable for a variety of social and religious reasons. I am not here to say this approach is absolutely wrong.</p>
<p>But I would like to propose a third view that may help us and the non-orthodox. The third view assumes that many non-orthodox would like and do enjoy religious experiences that can be shared with orthodox Jews. Some orthodox shuls (like <a href="pjecnter.com">Pacific Jewish Center</a>) appeal to non-orthodox Jews even though the services and rabbi and majority of community members are orthodox. The non-orthodox can share in the experience, attend shul, enjoy the kiddush, join for a Shabbos meal but with no kiruv subtext. It is purely for the sake of sharing a common religious experience.</p>
<p>If, as Alperson writes, non-orthodox Jews should be participating in more religious activities and they do. It would great if this could help foster a greater mutual respect and understanding between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews. There does not need to be a &#8220;my way or the highway&#8221; approach, nor does there need to any proselytizing. Simply Jews with different backgrounds, beliefs and opinions sharing a religious experience.</p>
<p>It works well for us at PJC. I hope and pray, more orthodox institutions and communities can follow our lead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This post is cross-posted to <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com" target="_blank">DovBear</a> &#8211; more discussion there</em></strong>.</p>
<p>I read an important column on a good website yesterday.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t on NYTimes.com or Yahoo.com or ESPN.com (some of my favorite sites to link from) this article was on <a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/" target="_blank">Vosizneias.com</a>. VIN is a Orthodox Jewish blog with editorials and news. I recommend checking it out when you have a chance.</p>
<p>The<a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/35083/2009/07/15/new-york-baalei-teshuva-turned-off-by-e2809cfrume2809d-people-engaging-in-corrupt-behavior/" target="_blank"> column I read was a great perpective on Baal Teshuvas</a> and their integration into the Frum community. In particular the column focused on various reactions of the BT (I use the term adoringly) when encountered with other (supposedly) Frum Jews who are not living up to their own standards.</p>
<p><span id="more-872"></span>Some BTs &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmNopAo0PRc&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">can&#8217;t handle the truth</a>&#8221; and wind up right where they started &#8211; wonderful secular people. Other BTs are more adept at maintaining their Frum lifestyle despite the disappointment. The article then enumerates some of the great things that BTs have contributed to the Frum lifestyle. Like manners, healthy eating, special education, etc.</p>
<p>While there is room for debate on whether the Frum community can attribute these &#8220;innovations&#8221; to BTs I am happy to give them the credit.</p>
<p>The article concludes by thanking the Frum community for showing them a way of life they love and appreciate.</p>
<p>I have two main points that I want to make in relation to this article.</p>
<p>1- The fake sales pitch the Frum From Birth Kiruv Rabbis spew.</p>
<p>2- The BTs reaction to the reality check.</p>
<p>I cannot stand the sales pitch that Frum people have no problems and Torah life is free from all social ills. It is simply not accurate. Please don&#8217;t use it!</p>
<p>In fact, the Torah is a guidebook for flawed people. If people were able to just become perfect then the Torah would give us one time instructions to &#8220;fix&#8221; our flaws and then we would be good to go! But instead, the Torah gives us instructions to develop our character through Mitzva observance with specific tasks. Some tasks only come around once in a lifetime, or once every 50 years, or once every seven years, or once a year, or once a month, once a week, once a day, and even every second. The clear message is that we need constant work because humans will eventually fall.</p>
<p>The Talmud explicitly states: &#8220;Do not believe in yourself (righteousness) until the day you die&#8221;. The human being is designed to fail without constant work and guidance.</p>
<p>I believe the honest sales pitch (and yes it is a sales pitch and that&#8217;s okay) is: Humans are flawed, we all need guidance, the Torah provides guidance. Some of it is obvious, some of it is hidden, but we believe that the Torah lifestyle is a guide for life. If you want a guide, you can buy in. We are all trying to use the guide as best as we can and we feel our lives are more enriched by using the guide. Maybe you will too.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important is the reaction of the BT. I sent this email to <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/juddmag" target="_blank">Judd Magilnick</a>, a<a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank"> Pacific Jewish Center</a> board member and he offered some great insight.</p>
<p>First, many &#8220;not yet&#8221; BTs back off from greater commitment by rationalizing that they saw a Frum person who lacked derech eretz (common courtesy). Judd says this is the Yetzer Hara talking but Frum folks need to realize that they are being judged and should act accordingly.</p>
<p>I once heard that R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein asked why we ask in Ahava Rabba that Hashem give us the ability to understand, listen to and teach Torah. Should the teaching part be reserved for teachers and rabbis? Why does veryone say it? And R&#8217; Moshe answers that we are all teachers. We are teaching others about how the Torah wants us to behave every time we act.</p>
<p>Judd&#8217;s next point was even better. Why should an impious Frum person affect one&#8217;s opinion of Torah? The analogy is if one sticks his wet finger in a socket he is going to get a shock. That doesn&#8217;t indicate a flaw in elecricity! And like electricity Torah has the power to do great good and it also has the power to cause ill. It depends on its user.</p>
<p>So (potential) BTs, if you can use Torah for good why would you let it bother you that someone else is abusing it? One has nothing to do with the other!</p>
<p>As a Rabbi in shul of mostly BTs and potential BTs I hear this kind of rhetoric often. &#8220;If he&#8217;s a Frum person he shouldn&#8217;t do X or Y etc&#8221;. It is disheartening but I have one response.</p>
<p>I always quote Rabbi Wein: &#8220;Don&#8217;t judge Judaism by its Jews&#8221;.</p>
<p>Additionally, I don&#8217;t <em>pitch</em> anything other that learning more Torah and experiencing a Shabbos meal. One should make their personal decisions based on an informed view that can only come from one&#8217;s own study. The Shabbos meal is just to make it a little more personal and less abstract. That&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>So, I am looking for insight, do people really judge Torah by its Jews?</p>
<p>Is there an &#8220;accurate&#8221; (non-cynical) sales pitch?</p>
<p>Anything else in the original column that struck you?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning I found <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-06-16/the-hidden-jews/full/" target="_blank">this article</a> in my inbox. From time to time, <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">PJC</a> board member, <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/juddmag" target="_blank">Judd Magilnick</a> sends me (and everyone else he knows) interesting links from all around the web, stretching to the outer limits of the blogosphere and conventional media.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s link covers something that is always on my mind.<span id="more-796"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-06-16/the-hidden-jews/full/" target="_blank">The column</a> discusses the latest research in DNA testing to identify if one is Jewish. There is a gene that is only passed from the mother to the child and it can be tested using a cheek swab DNA test.</p>
<p>Jewish roots are cropping up in the least likely of places. Al Qaeda spokesmen, Catholic Priests, a former Buddhist Catholic Radio Host to name a few. Historically, Fidel Castro, Madeleine Albright also claimed Jewish ancestry.</p>
<p>Now, it is testable.</p>
<p>DNA testing makes it possible to identify your Jewish gene as well.</p>
<p>What is fascinating to me is the idea that we are all related and it is scientifically &#8220;trackable&#8221;. The first time I went to Israel as a teen I experienced a profound feeling. I felt like I was among family. Everywhere I went was family. Every person I saw was a relative. I have always felt this way and in Israel it was an elevated sense of consciousness.</p>
<p>When I worked at <a href="http://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Southern California</a> for <a href="http://jamoncampus.com/" target="_blank">Ashreinu</a> I felt it every time I met another Jewish student.</p>
<p>Now, at the <a href="http://pjcenter.com" target="_blank">Pacific Jewish Center</a>, and especially when we are at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;q=505+Ocean+Front+Walk,+Venice,+Los+Angeles,+California+90291&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=1&amp;geocode=Ff2xBgIdAijw-A&amp;split=0&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=23.875,57.630033&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A" target="_blank">Shul on the Beach</a>, I feel it whenever <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/15/outreach-on-the-beach-61409/" target="_blank">someone new wanders in to our Shul</a>.</p>
<p>Frequently, I remark to fellow Jews the first time we meet, &#8220;We&#8217;re cousins ya know! We&#8217;re all cousins.&#8221; I don&#8217;t need DNA tests to prove it to me. I can feel it.</p>
<p>Taken to the next level. Not only are all Jewish people one family. The entire human race is one family. Yes, we have our disagreements about things, but in the end we are all family.</p>
<p>I think this is a powerful idea. I think we should consider this when hate creeps into our minds. I think we should teach this to our children. I think the more we see our similarities in one another the more peaceful our world will be.</p>
<p>Just last week <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/06/16/what-is-the-appropriate-reaction/" target="_blank">I blogged about a tragedy that happened to one of our &#8220;closer relative</a><a href="http://rabbifink.wordpress.com/2009/06/16/what-is-the-appropriate-reaction/" target="_blank">s&#8221;</a>. I think a lot of us felt strongly about the issue raised then because we innately feel that this happened to family. This is a fair reaction.</p>
<p>We must treat our &#8220;closer family&#8221; like the closer family that we are. But we must also not lose sight of our broader family. The entire world is family, because &#8220;we are all related&#8221;.</p>
