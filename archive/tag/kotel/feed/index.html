				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jerusalem051013_001-4_3_rx1443_c1920x1440.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7076" alt="jerusalem051013_001-4_3_rx1443_c1920x1440" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jerusalem051013_001-4_3_rx1443_c1920x1440-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>Last night, I was asked by Zev Brenner what I thought of the Women of the Wall vs. the Women for the Wall. I sidestepped the question on the radio but these are my thoughts.</em></p>
<p>Rosh Chodesh is supposed to be a day of renewal for the Jewish people and a special day in recognition of Jewish women. This past Rosh Chodesh at the Kotel women engaged in a fierce turf war.</p>
<p>For several years the Women of the Wall have held their Rosh Chodesh service at the Kotel. They wear prayer shawls, some wear tefillin, and they read from the Torah. This violated the rules of the Kotel and arrests were routinely made. The Israel courts determined that these rules were illegal and the Women of the Wall looked forward to a peaceful service, finally. But it was not to be. A new group called the Woman for the Wall who support traditional orthodox Judaism and oppose the Women of the Wall organized a huge counter protest.<span id="more-7075"></span></p>
<p>The NY Times reports:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Heeding calls from their rabbis, religious teenage girls turned up in large numbers to protest the group’s insistence on praying at the wall in religious garb traditionally worn by men. The girls crammed the women’s section directly in front of the wall by 6:30 a.m., forcing the liberal women to conduct their prayer service farther back on the plaza. There, hundreds of police officers locked arms in cordons to hold back throngs of black-hatted Orthodox men who whistled, catcalled, and threw water, candy and a few plastic chairs.</em></p>
<p>There were thousands of people there. I am sure that most of them were well behaved. I am sure that only a few of them contributed to the mayhem. But I am also sure that some people made fools out of themselves and a few even got arrested.</p>
<p>At this point, the issue of Women and the Wall has been so needlessly escalated that it seems unlikely a resolution will be reached. When I think about what has happened over the last few months I feel sad. I feel sad because this didn&#8217;t have to happen. Most of this is senseless outrage and manufactured controversy.</p>
<p>Go back a few months. Imagine the Kotel authority just looked the other way when a small group of women prayed in a different way than the other women. The Women of the Wall were not proselytizing, they were not trying to win converts, they were not trying to make a revolution at the Kotel. They just wanted to pray the way they like to pray. Is it the way orthodox Jewish women pray? Not usually. Is it halachically acceptable? Barely. But there is definitely room to allow it. The Women of the Wall would be a small blip on the Kotel radar as they have been for several years now. Especially now that the court sided in their favor, this Rosh Chodesh would have passed with little fanfare. The Women of the Wall would have done their thing without threat of arrest and no one would have been in the news or in jail.</p>
<p>Instead a massive counter protest was manufactured. Not too many people seemed bothered by the small group of Women of the Wall. No one really felt so outraged that they needed to do something about it. People noticed, or didn&#8217;t notice, and that was it. No big deal. Until last week. Until people were told to care, they didn&#8217;t. As was appropriate.</p>
<p>The organizers tapped into the two things that are guaranteed to draw big numbers: Daas Torah and paranoia about non-orthodox Jews. The rabbis said to go protest and so they went to protest. The pretext for the protest was that the Women of the Wall were out to uproot the sanctity of the Kotel and over time they were out to erode the very essence of orthodox Judaism. If that sounds crazy, it&#8217;s because it is. How can a few dozen women carry so much power? Why do the ultra-orthodox even care what they are doing? I don&#8217;t have the answer to that question and I have yet to see a satisfactory answer from anyone else.</p>
<p>They should have been left alone. Instead, thousands of people came to the Kotel on Friday and turned it into a battleground. And for what? Is there really any legitimate fear that charedi Judaism is in danger of being subverted by a few dozen women? Are we so paranoid, so insecure about our <em>frumkeit?</em> Is seeing some women praying in non-traditional ways such a danger?</p>
<p>The part that hurts me the most is that these women are not sinning, they are praying! While many may not agree with the manner in which they are praying, it boggles the mind that orthodox Jews would stifle prayer at the Kotel or anywhere for that matter. If we really believe that prayer is a mitzvah, and praying brings us closer to God, why would we deny others the same opportunity?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like the Women of the Wall are fornicating, <em>chas v&#8217;shalom, </em>at the Kotel. They are praying. We should be encouraging them. We should be impressed with their dedication to their prayers. We should be taking note that non-orthodox Jews can also be religious. Instead we are scared of them and their ideas. We let our fear turn into hate and violence. Our public statement to the world is that we cannot allow anyone to pray in a way that makes us a tad uncomfortable. In the end, I think this says a lot more about us than it says about them.</p>
<p>It is sad that it has come to this. Jew against Jew. One groups seeking the right to pray and the other doing their best to stop them. The script has been flipped. This is not a proud moment for us.</p>
<p>Tensions are high. Anger and rhetoric is escalating. I hope we can find within ourselves to cool off a bit, take a step back, and try to find common ground with the Women of the Wall. Maybe we can even see that it&#8217;s possible that God is smiling, <em>k&#8217;vyachol,</em> over these women who may not be as orthodox as some of us, but are yearning to connect to Him in the best way that they know how.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/world/middleeast/plan-to-resolve-western-wall-prayer-controversy.html?_r=1&amp;"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6923" alt="ISRAEL-articleLarge" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/ISRAEL-articleLarge-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>All hail Natan Sharansky, peacemaker. We hope.</p>
<p>The world has become witnesses to a very public and somewhat embarrassing battle over the Kotel. Although instead of the familiar disagreements between Palestinians and Israelis, this scuffle pitted Jew against Jew.</p>
<p>The Kotel is maintained by orthodox Jews who would like to preserve an atmosphere that is similar to orthodox synagogues and everything that entails. Many find attempts by women to lead small prayer services offensive. The women prayer services are often led by Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall. Hoffman has been arrested several times for leading such services and for the severe offense of wearing a particular kind of tallit.</p>
<p>The conflict was escalating and becoming more and more ugly with each passing arrest. More orthodox Jews cast aspersion toward Hoffman and more liberal minding Jews stood behind her.</p>
<p>The Forward first reported a breakthrough in negotiations headed by Natan Sharansky. The NY Times spoke with Sharansky and describes the plan:<span id="more-6922"></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Mr. Sharansky’s proposal involves expanding and improving the areas accessible for prayer at the wall to include the southern section known as Robinson’s Arch which, under his plan, would be open for Jews wishing to pray in a less Orthodox, more egalitarian style 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The main prayer section, which is now divided into men’s and women’s sections, would remain the domain of more traditional worshippers.</p>
<p>Sounds good to me!</p>
<p>Sharansky has close to ties to my family and my shul. My great uncle was responsible for his release from Soviet prison (see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Greenwald#Natan_Sharansky" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) and Sharansky&#8217;s daughter married a young man who grew up in my shul. His father, <strong>Alan Danziger</strong>, is the president of Pacific Jewish Center.</p>
<p>Alan told me that Sharansky was charged with coming up with a solution and he (jokingly) asked my advice. I suggested a three section Kotel (men, women, egalitarian) with each group getting use of the best area in the northenmost corner of the Kotel once in a while. I also thought it wise to have non-orthodox Jews participate in the administration of the Kotel.</p>
<p>So I am very pleased with the proposal. It&#8217;s not exactly what I suggested, but close enough. I really hope all parties will agree. The NY Times reports that Anat Hoffman and the Women of the Wall are not completely satisfied with the plan <em>&#8220;but we will compromise. You don’t always have to be right, you have to be smart, and compromise is a sign of maturity and understanding what’s at stake here.”</em></p>
<p>Compromise is good. Let&#8217;s hope everyone will be willing to accept this proposal.</p>
<p>Some have argued that people who are not comfortable with the current orthodox arrangements at the Kotel are few in number and they are too few to matter. I think this is ludicrous. Perhaps if more people were made to feel comfortable at our Holiest place, more people who are not orthodox sympathetic would come to the Kotel to pray and be inspired.</p>
<p>I think we can all agree that is a good result.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6361" title="8097381638_4188c0e0b8_b" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/8097381638_4188c0e0b8_b-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></p>
<p>By now you&#8217;ve probably heard that Anat Hoffman was arrested at the Western Wall last week. You may have read her personal account that describes a harrowing encounter with law enforcement. I don&#8217;t know if her claims are true or exaggerated, but her claims are irrelevant. Nor does it matter what sensationalist headlines have been penned.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post we will focus exclusively on facts and then my opinion based on those facts. Here are the facts:</p>
<p>Women of the Wall is an organization whose &#8220;mission is to achieve the social and legal recognition of our right, as women, to wear prayer shawls, pray, and read from the Torah collectively and out loud at the Western Wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those facts are undisputed. They are agitators. They are trying to change the status quo. They are activists.<span id="more-6360"></span></p>
<p>Anat Hoffman is their leader and her mission is to agitate, change the status quo. She is the chief activist.</p>
<p>The Women of the Wall write on their website that the law at the Western Wall is that no religious ceremony may be performed in the Women&#8217;s section of the Western Wall plaza. Although this is not a primary source, and I cannot find the primary source (feel free to fill me in), we will consider this a fact as well. The law has been interpreted to ban women from blowing a shofar or wearing a prayer shawl and from reading the Torah out loud.</p>
<p>Anat Hoffman leads a women&#8217;s prayer group at the Western Wall from time to time. She wears a prayer shawl and reads from the Torah. On several occasions Ms. Hoffman has been asked or demanded to cease these illegal activities. She does not acquiesce. She gets arrested.</p>
<p>This has happened several times. Each time it happens the media gets excited about it, Women of the Wall gets publicity, and&#8230; nothing changes.</p>
<p>Supporters of WOW find the law offensive and the subsequent arrests and treatment subversive.</p>
<p>Traditionalists consider Hoffman a disingenuous troublemaker who deserves what she gets.</p>
<p>Here is where the facts end and my opinion begins.</p>
<p>The law prohibiting women from religious ceremony at the Western Wall is a law that is written by orthodox rabbis to preserve the sanctity of their holiest place.They honestly believe that a woman who blows a shofar, or wears a prayer shawl, or reads from the Torah is an affront to God and the Holiness of the Western Wall. My question for them is why?</p>
<p>There is no prohibition against a woman doing any of these mitzvos. In fact, R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein writes that women are welcome to do these mitzvahs. There is nothing wrong with a woman reading from a Torah scroll for other women. Nothing at all. To be clear, the law is prohibiting actions that are permissible according to halacha. I find this hard to stomach.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s grant the rabbis of the Western Wall the power to legislate the decorum of the Western Wall. While this may be offensive to non-orthodox Jews, I can also understand why they have control over the Wall. But the rabbis of the Wall are only granted the right to legislate the Wall in accordance with Jewish law! So it is reasonable that they would prohibit men and women from praying together. It is also reasonable that they would mandate reasonably modest dress at the Wall. But it is not reasonable to enforce a rule that prevents people from performing mitzvahs that they are granted permission to perform!</p>
<p>It is hard to condone the law as it currently stands.</p>
<p>Some people have a hard time giving credence to an agitator like Anat Hoffman. While it may be challenging for Traditionalists to support her cause, the broader message of her cause is universal. All people should be granted the right to serve God at the Western Wall so long as it does not violate halacha. It seems hard to oppose that kind of rule.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really feel bad for Ms. Hoffman. She knows what is coming to her when she agitates the establishment. But just because she knows what is coming to her, that does not mean that her battle is not my battle. I empathize with Ms. Hoffman and I support her right to worship God at her holiest of places so long as she conforms to halacha. She has. Getting arrested for following halacha and doing a mitzvah at the Western Wall should not be the norm. This is a form of religious persecution.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, only the more liberal branches of Judaism have publically supported Ms. Hoffman.</p>
<p>This is the least effective way to change the established rules. Hopefully, the powers that be at the Western Wall will see the beauty and value in allowing women to pray in accordance with halacha even if it is not in accordance with their personal preferences and standards.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/tallis_kotel_prayer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4220" title="tallis_kotel_prayer" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/tallis_kotel_prayer-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" /></a>Here’s another, and probably the last post about my recent trip to Israel: (Read the previous three posts in the series here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/23/a-jerusalem-wedding/">A Jerusalem Wedding</a>,  <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/03/29/the-zilberman-home-a-thriving-jewish-family-in-the-arab-quarter-of-jerusalem/">The Zilberman Home: A Thriving Jewish Family in the Arab Quarter of Jerusalem</a> and <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/04/05/the-churva-shul-rises-from-the-ashes/">The Churva Shul Rises From the Ashes</a>)</em></p>
<p>During our trip, we had one group tour scheduled. We were all invited to join a Western Wall Tunnel Tour. At first, I was not that interested. After all, I had been on several Tunnel Tours already, and my tours were with the absolute best Tunnel Tours guide of all time, Esther Schlisser OB&#8217;M. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/07/30/mourning-the-living-on-the-9th-of-av/">Mourning The Living On The 9th of Av</a>). So I was reluctant to go again with a subpar tour guide.</p>
<p>I went anyway and I am glad I did. On that tour, I learned something very, very interesting.</p>
<p>For many reasons, I was always intrigued by the Western Wall. One thing that I often thought about was that when the Temple stood, it was a pretty meaningless wall. It was a retaining wall for the Temple Mount. Functional, not spiritual. The Midrash tells us that the Western Wall will never be destroyed. It also tells us that there is a concentration of spirituality in the Western Wall.</p>
<p>It is apparent that the wall transformed for our great rabbis after the destruction of the Temple from mundane to meaningful. But I had not heard of a source that speaks of prayer at the Western Wall. So I always wondered when it became a place of prayer.</p>
<p>During this recent Tunnel Tour I think I  got my answer.<span id="more-4212"></span></p>
<p>The Western Wall that we see today is really just the southern corner of the western wall that surrounded the Temple Mount. The western wall was much larger than it seems today. Larger in height and significantly longer from south to north. The Tunnel Tour takes you along the wall going north so that you actually pass the area immediately west of the Temple and the Holy of Holies. It continues beyond the Temple footprint as well.</p>
<p>As you walk north there are several gates or arches that were once used to enter the Temple Mount. They were filled in many years ago but the outline of the arch is still discernible.</p>
<p>One of these gates is called Warren&#8217;s Gate. Warren was an archaeologist who did not discover the arch. A friend, Wilson, named it after his friend. This gate is very close to the area that is immediately opposite the Holy of Holies. It is the closest gate to that area.</p>
<p>At one time, the gate led to a series of steps that one could take to the Temple Mount. After the Temple was destroyed, Jews were prohibited by the conquering Romans and subsequently the Christians from praying in the area.</p>
<p>When the Arabs took control of Jerusalem (in the 600&#8242;s CE) they permitted the Jews to pray in the area of the gate and due to its proximity to the Holy of Holies, the area actually became a synagogue.</p>
<p>In the Cairo Geniza a prayer was found that describes a pilgrimage to the Temple Mount. The Jews would come to Jerusalem from far and wide, they would circle the Temple Mount on foot and pray at each of the gates. In 1033 an earthquake damaged Warren&#8217;s Gate and letters found in the Geniza show that the Jews tried to raise funds from wealthier Jews to help pay for the repairs of the gate as it held much value to them. It seems that it was important that they be able to make their pilgrimages and pray at Warren&#8217;s Gate.</p>
<p>I believe that these Jews set the precedent for praying at the Western Wall. Warren&#8217;s Gate was synagogue long before the area that we call the Western Wall today. It was those Jews who made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem beginning in the 7th century that established the Western Wall as a place of prayer, a powerful tradition that is kept to this very day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A few years ago I was a campus Rabbi for the <a href="http://jamoncampus.com/" target="_blank">Jewish Awareness Movement </a>at <a href="http://www.usc.edu/" target="_blank">USC</a>. One of my primary responsibilities was to lead large groups of Jewish college students on inspiring trips to Israel.</p>
<p>Of course, the personal inspiration for me, was very often, greater than the inspiration for some of the students.</p>
<p>One episode has inspired me since the moment it occurred and it is directly related to today&#8217;s Tisha B&#8217;Av fast.</p>
<p><span id="more-921"></span>We always were sure to take the students on the <a href="http://english.thekotel.org/content.asp?id=116" target="_blank">Tunnel Tours of the Western Wall</a>. For me, it was incredible to see the beauty and grandeur of the gigantic white stones at the original base of the Western Wall. The Talmud in Sukkah tells of the beauty of the Second Temple that Herod rebuilt. It is hard to imagine such beauty when we see the above ground Western Wall today. Erosion and time have taken its physical beauty. But underground the stones are a pristine white and appear good as new.</p>
<p>Our tour guide was always the world renowned Esther Schlisser (who has since passed May Her Memory Be Blessed). Esther Schlisser was a one of a kind woman who took these tours very seriously. She allowed no talking, no photographs of her and she brazenly single-handedly led us through the Arab Quarter at the end of the tour during the second intifada.</p>
<p>We began the tour sitting in front of a really cool model of Herod&#8217;s Second Temple and with the magic of technology it transforms into the current Old City layout. The route of the tour took us deep down to the lower Western Wall base stones and along the Wall below the Arab Quarter. What we see of the Wall today, is a fraction of the size of the original Wall.</p>
<p>We finally arrived at my favorite spot. There is a section of floor from the Second Temple era that has been excavated and this is where Esther had us all sit on floor. I really enjoy touching history, and walking and sitting on the floor where our grandparents sat 2000 years ago is very powerful for me.</p>
<p>Esther then begins to tell us where we are sitting and the great men who must have walked these same cobble stones. She then begins to cry. Esther tells us the following (paraphrased to the best of memory):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;These stones are alive!</em></p>
<p><em>My husband died many years ago. When he died I was sad. I cried for days, for months, but eventually, I began to heal and I no longer cry for my husband. This is because my husband is dead and we cannot cry over something that is dead forever. I miss him terribly, but I do not cry.</em></p>
<p><em>However, I come to this spot, the floor right in front of the Western Wall of the Second Temple at least once a day for the past 10 years. Every single time I come here, I cry. I cry that we are exiled and that we cannot see the Temple in its true grandeur and I cry that we are at the mercy of the nations of the world and we cannot rule ourselves as per the Torah&#8217;s command. Jews have been crying here for centuries. We will continue to cry until we are redeemed from this exile.</em></p>
<p><em>There is only one way to explain this. The stones are alive. The Wall is alive. There is a soul in the bricks that lives. Its voice is small, it is weak, but it is alive and that is how we can cry centuries of tears for a destroyed Temple. The Temple may have been destroyed but still, it lives.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>A very powerful experience and one I think of very often.</p>
<p>On this Tisha B&#8217;Av, remember that we are not crying over a dead Temple. If it were so, we would have stopped crying eons ago. The stones are alive. They are kept alive by the promise that we will see a Third Temple. They are kept alive by the souls of the Jewish people yearning for their Temple to be rebuild. And they are kept alive by the tears we cry on Tisha B&#8217;Av every single year.</p>
