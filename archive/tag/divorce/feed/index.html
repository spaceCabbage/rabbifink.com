				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>The ongoing conversation about the agunah problem in the wake of the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/05/the-ny-post-agunah-story-is-about-much-more-than-jewish-divorce/" target="_blank">Gital Dodelson article in the NY Post</a> consistently raises one impossibly difficult question. I’ve been asked this question many times and in many different ways. In my opinion, it’s the fundamental issue of the agunah crisis.</p>
<p>The public is justifiably angry with a husband who does not give a get. But the recalcitrant husband has a pretty compelling argument in his favor.<span id="more-7805"></span></p>
<p>The Torah itself gives the husband absolute authority in the matter of the divorce. If this is Torah law then we are forced to say that this is God’s will. If God gave the power of divorce to the man alone, how can it be considered wrong or evil if he does not give his wife a get? And how can we call it an injustice when he does not give a get? Don’t blame the husband, blame the Torah. The Torah is at fault. God is at fault. Change the laws of divorce and the problem will be solved!</p>
<p>Some variant of this question is the crux of the agunah problem. In simple terms, why is the husband a bad guy when he doesn’t give a get if God gave him the power to decide if he wants to give the get? It is a very difficult question for an Orthodox Jew. And now it is being asked over and over again.<a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/large-9564591.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7807" alt="large-9564591" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/large-9564591.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I think I have an answer to this question.</p>
<p>It’s true that in terms of divorce law, the power to divorce vests in the husband and he is the only one who can dissolve a marriage. The husband must willingly give the get. We are stuck with that law. Pure legalistic Torah matters are almost always unassailable. There is almost no way for contemporary rabbinic authorities to change a law derived from the Torah or even established by Chazal. There’s just no acceptable mechanism within Orthodox Judaism to make changes to Torah law.</p>
<p><em>(Rabbinic laws often have loopholes baked into the law, e.g. eruvei chatzeros, eruv tavshilin. Pruzbul and hefker beis din hefker are examples of the rabbis creating a legal fiction that circumvents Torah laws with regard to money, they do not change the actual Torah laws.)</em></p>
<p>The thing is, divorce law is not the only part of the Torah that informs us how to behave in case of divorce. That part of the Torah is will never change. There are other parts of the Torah that do fluctuate and are subject to societal norms and niceties. Ethical and moral laws in the Torah depend on the context. Kindness and virtue largely depend on the subjective expectations of one’s friends and community. Perhaps at one time a certain act or behavior was considered normal and fair. But at a different time it could be considered evil or wrong. Things in this arena are more subjective and they do change. These <em>bein adam l’chaveiro</em> elements of the Torah always apply and I think they are especially important during a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> One is obligated to love his fellow as himself. “That which is hated to you, do not do to others.” Would a husband want his wife to hold him hostage? No. Thus it is prohibited to hold the wife hostage.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> It is prohibited to cause an animal pain. All the more so it is prohibited to cause pain to a fellow human being. Withholding a get causes extreme pain to the estranged wife.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> One who causes emotional damage to another person is obligated to compensate the victim. One cannot act in a way that causes other emotional harm. R’ Elyashiv <em>paskened</em> that sexual abusers were <em>rodfim</em> (pursuers) because of the emotional harm caused by their violence toward their victims. Causing another person emotional harm is a very serious issue and is absolutely against the Torah.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> The Torah requires that we help unload the animal of our enemy. Many authorities learn from this that we are required to lend a helping hand to anyone who requires help. Does a wife waiting for her get not require assistance?<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> We are obligated to follow in the merciful ways of God. Is it merciful to withhold a get? Clearly not. A recalcitrant husband violates this mitzvah as well.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Read the prophets. Their words often constitute rabbinic obligations. They admonish us for mistreating the underprivileged. A wife at the mercy of her husband is underprivileged.</p>
<p>The list goes on. There are many interpersonal obligations and prohibitions that are blatantly trampled upon when one withholds a get. I don’t think there is an doubt about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the objective laws of divorce won’t ever change. But the subjective laws of how to treat one’s wife during a divorce are subject to change. Maybe at one time it was not evil to withhold a get. I don&#8217;t understand it, but I accept that it may have been normative behavior at one time in history. But our common sense tells us that today it is amoral to cause this kind of pain to anyone, let alone one’s wife.</p>
<p>Turns out that while the Jewish laws of divorce don’t obligate the husband to give a get and a wife really cannot divorce her husband, by refusing to give a get the husband is violating several other mitzvahs. In other words, if one isolates the get issue as a pure question of Jewish divorce law it’s true that the wife is powerless and seemingly unprotected. But the Torah is not so simple. We don’t isolate civil law from religious law and we don’t sequester civil and religious law from the Torah’s moral and ethical laws. It’s all part of one Torah given by one God. Exploiting a legal loophole does not justify violating ethical laws in the Torah. It’s forbidden to be a jerk. It’s an <em>issur d’orysa</em> in many instances. It does not matter that the Torah gives him the right to be a jerk. It’s still assur.</p>
<p>I think that the original question obfuscates just how terrible it is to withhold a get. It is so obviously a horrible way to act towards a fellow human being. Regardless of whether it is within the husband’s legal right to withhold the get, it is patently clear that by refusing to give a get a husband is in violation of the ethical and moral laws as well as the spirit of the Torah.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>One of our Jewish sisters, Gital Dodelson (Weiss) published a heartrending account of her marriage to a now-recalcitrant husband Avrohom Weiss. Reading her story brought tears to my eyes. It’s so painful to hear of her struggle and there were a few lines in there that resonate with all of us who may have some issues with parts of the Orthodox Jewish establishment.</p>
<p>There are two sides to every story and her husband’s family and supporters have supported Mr. Weiss’s right to withhold the get.<span id="more-7783"></span></p>
<p>I’ll be quick on the get issue. I don’t care what the supposed justification might be, I don’t care how terrible of a person a wife might be, I don’t care if she broke Jewish tradition, broke Jewish law, is an adulterer, is a bad mother, I don’t care about any of it. There is no justification for withholding a get. Wielding a legal document as a weapon to a person whom one willingly entered into a marriage and supposedly loved and shared a life with, is abuse. I cannot condone any forms of abuse. Emotional, financial, sexual, verbal, or any other form of abuse is against Torah principles.</p>
<p><em>(For more on this topic see: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/11/07/answering-the-most-difficult-question-about-the-agunah-crisis/">Answering the Most Difficult Question About the Agunah Crisis</a>)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/divorce.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7784" alt="divorce" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/divorce-600x400.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Further, the statement from the Weiss camp does not justify not giving a get. Not even in their own words.</p>
<p>In fact, in this case there is apparently a letter (I say apparently, because one never knows if a letter is real these days) from leading Charedi rabbis who support Gital. This is an important fact as the Weiss family carries heavy rabbinic credentials and mockingly claimed that Gital was only being supported by YU and ORA. This is obviously untrue. More importantly, it doesn’t matter. There is no justification for withholding a get.</p>
<p>As an aside, this saga demonstrates how little social sanctions matter in contemporary Orthodox Judaism. No one cares. This guy is not suffering any serious social consequences for his recalcitrance.</p>
<p><strong>But I think this story is more about Orthodox Jewish marriage than it is about Orthodox Jewish divorce.</strong></p>
<p>Gital claims she did not want to continue dating Avrohom after the first or second date. Her parents and support group pushed her into it. And from there, her troubles began.</p>
<p>We’ve discussed the infantilization of young adults within Orthodox Judaism. Parents love their children very much and want what is best for their children. But parents are often wrong and often have different interests than their children. Yet, in the Shidduch System parents vet potential suitors, parents push children to continue dating, parents pay for the wedding and make it a party for their friends that the children are invited to, parents support their children and we all know that money comes with strings attached, the married couple eventually is thrust into difficult life situations with no real life experience, a minivan full of their own children, and no idea how they got there.</p>
<p>Young couples are hardly even given the opportunity to work things out. Dating is short. The focus is on external things and simple things like getting along nicely. But there is rarely enough time to even work out a problem together. Engagements are too quick and hectic to encounter and tackle real challenges. Obviously couples do not live together before marriage so there is no way of really knowing what that is going to be like. They get married and it’s traumatic for most couples. Which would be okay if they had the tools and skills to figure it out. But they don’t. Almost always, pregnancy begins almost immediately and now the focus is on a young woman surviving the difficulties of pregnancy. Eventually that becomes navigating parenthood. But again, there is little time to work on the marriage and the relationship. Let alone time to figure out one’s religious feelings.</p>
<p>Indeed, the system as it is today makes it increasingly difficult to be prepared for life’s challenges. According to Gital, Avrohom says he can’t handle it when things don’t go his way. He’s not the only one.</p>
<p>This dovetails into a bit of anecdotal disillusionment with Orthodox Jewish marriage and post-Yeshiva life. Anecdotally, people are finding it harder to make marriages work and finding it harder to make their frum lifestyle work in sync with their spouse. The sometimes spoken, but always unspoken goal of Orthodox Jewish life until 20years old is to get married. Get a good shidduch. Be a desirable match. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about and then everything is supposed to just work out nicely. Fall in line with the communal standards and way of life. People get married young and before they’ve had a chance to find their religious niche. It can change a lot between the age of 20 and 30. But most of us are married closer to 20 and by the time 30 comes along, it feels like it’s too late.</p>
<p>Gital writes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“If I move on romantically without a get, I would have to leave this community — my friends and family and entire support system — because it’s committing adultery. My children and I would be ostracized and not welcomed in the community.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Some people might argue that I should ignore the traditions of the Torah. But I’m deeply religious and won’t go against the God I believe in.”</em></p>
<p>This is one part that made me cry. The feeling of being stuck is more and more common. These people want to be frum. They believe in God. They believe in the Torah. But they don’t believe in many aspects of the Orthodox Jewish lifestyle. But our communities are so monolithic that it makes being a non-conformist very challenging. Sometimes it&#8217;s even social suicide.</p>
<p>It’s easier in Modern Orthodox Judaism, but even there we see an expected conformity that can be uncomfortable for some. Today’s Orthodox Judaism is very rigid in its organization of people and groups. That kind of inflexibility is having an adverse affect on many people.</p>
<p>I am sure there is some Yeshiva guy out there who, after reading this article, says he wants to date for longer or spend more time getting to know a potential shidduch. But will the community and his parents allow it? Unlikely.</p>
<p>Others will read this and wonder why it’s okay for Weiss to terrorize his ex-wife but a woman who wears the wrong clothing is ostracized.</p>
<p>These are legitimate issues that are all raised by the saga between Gital, Avraham, and their supporters. I hope their situation is resolved soon. I really do. But I think the story illustrates some of our more systemic problems that are affecting many more people than just the few Agunos out there.</p>
<p>I thank Gital for writing her story. It gives us an opportunity to reflect on the state of normative Orthodox Judaism today and perhaps a chance to right the ship. It’s a big ship and it doesn’t handle very well. But the next generation of Orthodox Judaism will have a say in how it is steered.</p>

<p>It seems the &#8220;impossible&#8221; has happened again. Kelly Myzner lost custody of her children last week.</p>
<p>I have not seen the court documents. Although I have read a few articles about the case and I am well aware that every situation has at least two sides to the story.</p>
<p>If you want to see one version of the facts go to Unpious and read <a href="http://www.unpious.com/2013/05/ex-hasidic-mother-loses-custody-of-children/">Ex-Hasidic Mother Loses Custody of Children</a> by Shulem Deen. Whether the facts are the way the ex-hasid community presents them or not, the phenomena is real.<span id="more-7101"></span></p>
<p>It is true that <em>baalei teshuva </em>in the chasidic community will be set up with less than stellar matches. It is true that sometimes those less than stellar young men or women have personality defects. It is true that personality defects worsen in one&#8217;s 20&#8242;s and are further exacerbated by marriage and parenthood. It is true that people who are in bad marriages will see the worst of their society and will look outside their community. It is true that people in a marriage can get fed up with one another and find themselves in completely different religious spheres. Sometimes the couple will seek divorce.</p>
<p>What happens next is the real point here.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the primary caregiver &#8211; usually the mother, is awarded primary custody. However, sometimes the mother is denied custody for a potpourri of reasons. One reason that has been used in court proceedings is that the children should stay in the same religious environment. Usually this means that the parent who is deviating will lose custody. When it is the mother, the courts will sometimes deny the mother custody.</p>
<p>There are several possible reasons for this: First, the assumption could be that deviating from the agreed upon religious beliefs in the marriage is like a breach of contract. She breached, so he wins. Second, deviating could be viewed as a a symptom of imbalance. Third, the children have a status quo of religious practice and taking that away from them and them away from it is unfair collateral damage. Fourth, the court systems are rigged and they are bought and paid for by the ultra-orthodox community. Fifth, the ultra-orthodox community projects a unified front and unwavering support for their own so the chances that the children will be cared for increases within the ultra-orthodox community. Sixth, the ultra-orthodox community pays for a super-lawyer while the deviating party gets by with a legal aid lawyer and the super-lawyer wins.</p>
<p>I am not saying that all these reasons are true, fair, or valid. However, they are all part of the equation. So I don&#8217;t think that the sole reason anyone loses custody is because they deviated from the religious beliefs. But religion is definitely used as a weapon in these proceedings.</p>
<p>My feeling is that the children of these families are going to need their mothers more than most children. They will have a hard time throughout their lives due to the disparate religious beliefs of their parents and families. As long as the mother is a good mother, the mother should be taking care of the children. A good mother has nothing to do with religion. Good mothers are everywhere, not just in the ultra-orthodox community.</p>
<p>I think there needs to be a very strong reason to deny the mother custody. I don&#8217;t think that being an atheist is a valid reason. More importantly, I don&#8217;t love the idea of the secular court system weighing the religious beliefs of the parents to determine custody. It&#8217;s probably not a good idea and it might not stand up to constitutional scrutiny.</p>
<p>Most importantly, using children as pawns in any custody battle is deplorable. But when children are used to keep people in the fold we cross the line from deplorable to cult-like. The community does not own the children. That is what happens in a cult. Parents are responsible to raise their children as they deem fit. If the parents have differing opinions on those issues, it is their issue and they must resolve it. But using the brute force of a strong insular community to win the day is just not acceptable.</p>
<p><em>If I see the court documents I will be able to confirm the particulars of this case. In the meantime these are my general thoughts.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Divorce.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5642" title="Divorce" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Divorce-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>I don&#8217;t normally read Ami Magazine. I don&#8217;t read any of the frummags on a regular basis. But once in a while someone sends me a particular article of interest. Last week&#8217;s Ami presented a short article that is worthy of more attention and discussion.</p>
<p>I suggest reading the entire article before this blog post. I have attached it to this post and you can read it by clicking here: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Ami-Mag-Student-Loans.pdf" target="_blank">Ami &#8211; Do Us Part</a>.</p>
<p>To summarize: Uber-yeshiva student gets the uber-shidduch. She goes to school and takes out loans and neglects to tell him. He finds out and thinks her parents are paying. He thinks her parents will support them indefinitely. They don&#8217;t. Their troubles start with their second child around the same time he finds out that he and his wife are responsible for the student loans. Eventually things deteriorate, he needs to leave yeshiva, his rabbis are sad that he has to leave, they all thought he would learn full time, literally until he died, the couple gets divorced after their <em>fourth</em> child.<span id="more-5639"></span></p>
<p>His lesson from the whole things seems to be that you should get the details of the financial arrangement with your in-laws before you agree to marry their daughter. If you think I am wrong about that being his lesson, I am open to other suggestions.</p>
<p>The article, I think unwittingly, displays several of the inherent flaws in the current yeshiva lifestyle.</p>
<p>Their marriage seemed like such a business arrangement. He would learn, forever, she would work and get money from her parents, their children would be raised by baby-sitters and this would continue forever. And ever. Forever, ever, ever, <a href="http://youtu.be/MYxAiK6VnXw?t=2m37s" target="_blank">ever</a>. It seems he never discussed this with his in-laws. It was <em>expected</em> without even a discussion. How does this become a default standard? No matter how amazing a talmudic scholar a 23 year old young man is capable of becoming with a lifetime dedicated to Torah study, if someone else is going to pay your bills <em>forever</em> isn&#8217;t a formal agreement and expression of gratitude the baseline minimum for such an arrangement?!</p>
<p>The wife is not completely off the hook here either. She basically took on a ton of debt without even mentioning it to her husband. Granted, he was not going to be working to pay off those bills, but to blindside her husband with an avalanche of bills and debt is inexcusable. Once again, a lack of communication. This time it was between husband and wife creating strife in the marriage. Sensing a pattern here?</p>
<p>Then we have the interesting fact that their marriage troubles began with two children in the family and they continued to procreate, no doubt as part of their devotion to God and religion, and doubled their family size before getting a divorce. The marital problems were readily apparent. The article says they fought often and they were miserable. So what were they thinking? Let&#8217;s just have as many kids as possible while our marriage falls apart? Let&#8217;s add more financial responsibilities while we can&#8217;t afford our current lifestyle? Let&#8217;s give more kids miserable or divorced parents? It makes no sense. Unless you consider that they probably never even discussed it. Again, lack of communication.</p>
<p>But this issue goes to one more point. The taboo subject of orthodox Jewish family planning. Is it responsible to have four children with extremely limited income, a husband who absolutely does not want to earn a living, and a set of miserable parents? Was there a rabbi in their life who was urging them to have kids? Was there a rabbi in their life who could have advised them that contraceptives might be a wise choice at a certain point? What happened here?</p>
<p>In my opinion, there needs to be an honest conversation between prospective brides and grooms with rabbis who can properly advise these young, wide-eyed,  soon to be married couples about family planning. Hopefully I will write a more comprehensive blog post about that subject sometime in the future. In the meantime, it is sufficient to say that not all rabbinic authorities in the charedi world are in agreement and most young couples are not as informed as they need be.</p>
<p>Finally, I think this young man needs an attitude adjustment. He acts like his life is ruined because he can&#8217;t stay in kollel. I really believe that he feels that way. But he needs to know that one can grow in Torah, y<em>iras shamayim,</em> and <em>avodas Hashem</em> outside the walls of the kollel. I don&#8217;t blame him for thinking otherwise as this is the underlying message of much of our Torah education prevalent in our yeshivos and Bais Yaakov&#8217;s today.</p>
<p>Case in point: A daughter of one of the biggest Torah scholars and <em>ovdei Hashem</em> that I know in the charedi world was awakened to this message in a rather shocking manner. Her seminary teacher advised the young women in her class that if they look for a shidduch and the guy wants to earn a living the young man is not a <em>yarei shamayim</em> and they should never consider it. She found that particularly offensive when she considered that her father works 9-5 every day and teaches a <em>daf yomi b&#8217;iyun </em>class and has been through <em>shas b&#8217;iyun</em> passing up promotions at work so he could keep his daily Torah regimen of several hours of learning all while earning a living. In my estimation, he learns more than the average kollel fellow. You can see why the seminary teacher&#8217;s statement would hurt this young woman.</p>
<p>That man should be the paradigm. That should be the ultimate goal. It should not feel like a failure for the uber-bochur to take his skills to the outside world and carry on his lifelong mission of acquiring Torah and growing in spirituality outside the walls of the kollel. All he needs to do is look for role models in contemporary frum society, and there are plenty, and he can affix his gaze on the myriad of Tannaim, Amoraim, Gaonim, Rishonim, and Achronim who balanced their Torah learning and scholarship with making a living. The way it was meant to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/divorce.gif"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5243" title="divorce" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/divorce.gif" alt="" width="269" height="269" /></a>A lot of people seem to agree that the chasidic system (maybe even the charedi system as well) of marriage and dating needs some updating. There is also a consensus that using religion as a weapon to keep people in the fold is wrong. Most people also think that mothers should have custody of their children even if they are not religious and the father is religious.</p>
<p>Is there any hope that the charedi and chasidic worlds can adapt and adjust to fix these problems?</p>
<p>From what I am hearing, the answer is yes. Several commenters on the blog and Facebook have shared encouraging developments. It seems they are open to new ideas. In this spirit, allow me to make a few suggestions. Keep in mind, these are suggestions for insular communities. I prefer non-insular communities in general. But in the meantime, here is some advice that can be implemented within the insular communities.<span id="more-5242"></span></p>
<p>First, some definitions:</p>
<p>Chasidic community: A<em>n insular community where the entire community is expected to conform to one way of religious life.</em></p>
<p>Chasidic dating: <em>Parents arrange meeting between two 17-18 year olds. They meet for 30 minutes. They decline or agree to see each other again. The second date seals the deal.</em></p>
<p>Charedi community: A<em> non-chasidic community that tries to reduce engagement with the outside world and prefers a lifestyle of exclusive Torah study over a career.</em></p>
<p>Charedi dating: <em>Parents arrange a meeting between a preferably 18-19 year old girl and a 22-23 year old boy. They meet for 3-4 hours between 4-8 times. They get engaged and see each other a few times before the wedding 2 months later.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dating</strong></p>
<p>No one under the age of 19 should be considered for a shidduch. They are off limits. Couples should date for no fewer than 1 month and see each other a minimum of 10 times before getting engaged. Dates should be fun, encourage conversation, the conversations should include things like how excited one is about religion and if there are things that they question.</p>
<p>Engagements should last 3 months. The couple should see each other no less than once every two weeks. When they see one another they should have fun and enjoy each other&#8217;s company. They should have at least a preliminary conversation about intimacy before the wedding night. The teachers who will explain to them how &#8220;things work&#8221; should be extremely highly qualified and be as liberal as the community allows.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
<p>Couples should be advised on matters of family planning. This is not the place to go to far into detail. But if the children of the couple will be a burden on the community, they might need to ask a shyla before having children, not vice versa. Further, when a couple has children too quickly, it can stunt the development of their relationship which is barely in its infancy after a contracted dating period and quick marriage.</p>
<p><strong>When Things Go Wrong</strong></p>
<p>During a marriage, one spouse may prefer a more or less religious lifestyle. This should not be immediate grounds for divorce. The goal should be happiness for the couple and keeping the family together. Men should not be defined by the way their wives act and women should not be defined by the way their husbands act. Religious compatibility does not need to be the deciding factor in marriage. I know couples who are very happy and they each observe to different degrees. This should be acceptable.</p>
<p>If the couple is incompatible religiously and incompatible in general a divorce should be sought. The get should not be withheld at all. The couple should strive for a custody agreement that is mutually agreeable. If they cannot agree, the secular courts should decide it. A Beis Din is not the place to decide custody matters when one parent is more religious than the other. It is inherently unfair. The couple better try their best to agree because the courts may decide to create a system that neither party likes.</p>
<p>These are some of my thoughts and ideas. I don&#8217;t imagine that they will solve all the problems. Nor do I imagine that any system is perfect. But I do believe that not tweaking the system will cause it to collapse. Albert Einstein said: <em>&#8220;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We want different results. We want better results. Perhaps these suggestions can help just a bit.</p>
<p>I am open to any ideas you have. Remember we are trying to maintain the basic standards of the chasidic and charedi communities. Major overhauls are a non-starter.</p>
