				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A few years ago, my father told me he was reading a very interesting book about scandals and hidden stories from the Chasidic world called <em>Ne’echaz B’Svach</em>. I wanted to read it too, but I don’t have the Hebrew skills to read an academic book in modern Hebrew.</p>
<p>This summer I saw a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611681944/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1611681944&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Untold Tales of the Hasidim: Crisis and Discontent in the History of Hasidism</a> by David Assaf, that looked like it could be a translation of the Hebrew book, I asked Tuvia if it was in fact an English version of Ne’echaz B’Svach. Before he finished saying yes I grabbed it and was swiping my credit card.</p>
<p>The book did not disappoint. Whenever I read a good book, I dog-ear the pages with lines or ideas that seem important or interesting to me. I have never read a book where I dog-eared more pages. It’s almost impossible to do a proper review on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611681944/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1611681944&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Untold Tales of the Hasidim</a> because there is just too much that I want to say.<span id="more-7878"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="//instagram.com/p/hMK600NRxs/embed/" height="710" width="612" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The book is divided into unrelated chapters about specific incidents in the Chasidic world spanning two centuries. The common denominator among the stories is a active effort to limit the knowledge of these stories by Chasidic groups and leaders as well as an effort to reinterpret the stories as less unsavory than the true facts would indicate.</p>
<p>The objective of the book is to explore these stories based on facts and rumor, as well as to understand the various reinterpretations and retellings of these stories. But for what purpose? In the author’s own words:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“The ability to handle unpleasant episodes in a critical fashion and the willingness to consider change, or even to pay a price for mistakes, mark an optimistic, proud, and confident society. A society in crisis, or one suffering from a lack of confidence or self-esteem, tends to adopt a defensive attitude toward criticism and a hesitant one toward the past, viewing the exposure of its secrets as posing a mortal danger to its stability.”</em></p>
<p>In other words, by sweeping dirt under the rug we demonstrate a lack of maturity that poses a much more basic risk to our way of life than the actual incidents themselves. It’s never the crime, it’s always the cover up. Later in the first chapter, Assaf notes that the Haredi media glosses over the issues in its own backyard to protect the reputation and good standing of the community. (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/06/02/reputation-obsession-taking-tov-shem-mshemen-tov-a-good-name-is-better-than-good-oil-to-the-next-level/" target="_blank">Reputation Obsession</a>) As Rabbi Horowitz has noted, this is more like Pravda and less like the New York Times.</p>
<p>There are seven chapters in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611681944/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1611681944&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Untold Tales of the Hasidim</a>. The first is a general introduction and overview of the methodology and purpose of the book. The next six chapters are each devoted to one episode.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611681944/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1611681944&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7881" alt="9781611681949_p0_v1_s260x420" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/9781611681949_p0_v1_s260x420.jpg" width="255" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Of the six, I loved two of them and I enjoyed two others. The remaining two were just alright, but still absolutely worth reading.</p>
<p>My favorites were the final two chapters. Chapter six deals with Rabbi Menacham Mendel Friedman of Itscan (early 20th century). He was a Rebbe in training when he died at age 54 and also a Renaissance Chasid. That sounds almost impossible, but it is true. Rabbi Friedman was basically a Maskil type of Rebbe. He studied and loved art, literature, science, and philosophy. His Torah works are unlike any other Torah works written by Chasidic Rebbes in that they are littered with more modern interpretations of Talmudic statements and progressive ideas about Orthodox Judaism. Yet, he maintained a steadfast commitment to Torah and Mitzvos as well as a deep passion for its survival and growth. He forcefully condemns the fools who believe in superstition and the ignorant leadership that was in his opinion, corrupt. He calls religious zeal a plague and for a very stark separation of religion and state in politics.</p>
<p>This was a man who could have started a movement of Chasidus that adapted and changed with the times. A Chasidus that embraced secular knowledge and engagement. But he died young and his followers were too few to amount to a proper Chasidic movement.</p>
<p>Of course, his books are no longer considered acceptable in some circles. A letter in the Yated Ne&#8217;eman in Israel publicly denounced his writings as &#8220;problematic&#8221; and Rabbi Friedman&#8217;s works are unlikely to influence contemporary Chasidic communities as they were intended.</p>
<p>The last chapter of the book is mostly just a translation of a letter written by a Belz Rebbe in training (early 20th century). The son in law of the Belz Rebbe wrote a heartfelt confession about his doubts and antipathy toward the Chasidic mode of dress and lifestyle. He believes in God and in Judaism, but he cannot endure the narrow straits of the Belz life, especially in the court of the Rebbe. The pain in his words leaps off the page. It&#8217;s a rare peek into the mind of a skeptical 20 year old Chasid who is stuck in his life because he does not want to hurt his mother. He knows that if he leaves she will bear the brunt of his defection. She does not deserve that, he reasons, so he stays. By all accounts, he stays and succeeds. No indication that he had doubts or misgivings about his lifestyle exists, other than his confession.</p>
<p>He writes that the first Hasidim were righteous people. But the Hasids of his day were &#8220;wheeling and dealing&#8221;. The Hasids come to the rebbe to pay a fee and have miracles performed on their behalf. There is no growth, there is no soul, there is no virtue. Interestingly enough, his sisters were much more worldly (this illustrates the need that was being addressed by Sarah Schenirer) and they provided him a safe haven to be himself.</p>
<p>In his letter, he describes some of the ascetic customs in his world that were treated an incontrovertible law. Men and women shaved their heads before the wedding. Women were forbidden from wearing wigs. He wears a shtreimel, she wears a scarf and clothing that was in style during the era of Chmielnitzki. He writes that it&#8217;s objectively a hilarious sight but because it is his future it makes him cry. At the end of his letter, he expresses hope that he will grow in the court of Belz and be able to influence his world to modify their social strictures.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious why these two characters were my favorites. They represent some of the struggles of people I deal with on a regular basis. Their struggles are not over, they are just as prominent today as they have ever been. It&#8217;s helpful for those people to find comfort in the works of these great rabbis and perhaps hope that the Renaissance Rebbe and inside reformer will return to Chasidic and Charedi Judaism today.</p>
<p>The two chapters I enjoyed were about Moshe the son of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liady and Rabbi Akiva Shalom Chajes. The two that appealed least to me were about the Seer of Lublin and the battle against Bratslav Chasidim.</p>
<p>There is so much more to discuss in this book. It&#8217;s packed with discussion points that I would love to engage, but it&#8217;s really too much for a review. I will just make one more point.</p>
<p>Recently we&#8217;ve been hearing about turf type wars in Israel between followers or Gedolim. We&#8217;ve known about Chasidic turf wars for decades as well. It seems that this might be deeply rooted in tradition. At one point there was an arms race to conquer cities and towns in the Ukraine and incorporate them under the flag of a Rebbe. Violence was not uncommon and thuggery was the norm. People who did not adhere or acquiesce were deported, isolated, punished, or excommunicated. This is all considered background information for one of the chapters in the book. It&#8217;s the scandal of that chapter. It&#8217;s the socio-political backdrop. When we read about it in the past we shake our heads and wonder how this was acceptable. But are we not seeing the same things today? What will history say about us who watch as this kind of behavior is found in our circles?</p>
<p>This is why history is so important. We need to learn from our past and correct mistakes. We need to know what our past mistakes were in order to correct them.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll read about several mistakes and anti-social patterns in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1611681944/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1611681944&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Untold Tales of the Hasidim</a>. It is our hope that we use the lessons of history and build a better future for Orthodox Judaism and the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>Randi Zuckerberg, sister of Mark Zuckerberg, inventor of the Internet, or something like that, published an article in the Daily Mail about Internet use. It’s a promo for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062285149/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062285149&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank">recently published book called Dot Complicated</a>. Her premise in the article is that being too digitally attached is causing us to forget to live our lives.</p>
<p>She talks a bit about the idea of a Digital Sabbath that is gaining in popularity. Taking one day off from our gadgets and simply spending quality time with our loved ones.</p>
<p><span id="more-7847"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/unplug.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7848" alt="unplug" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/unplug.jpg" /></a>Further, she urges us to be aware of the difference between communicating via the Internet and communicated face to face or even through a phone call. It’s much more personal to directly tell close one about news or happenings in one’s life. Just because the Internet makes it easier, does not mean it should substitute for more traditional means of communication in all instances.</p>
<p>I have two things to say about this article.</p>
<p>First, while a Digital Sabbath is a superb idea and I love that it’s finding mainstream acceptance, I am loathe to use this as a reason to observe Shabbos. To me, Shabbos is an eternal day. It hearkens back to the earliest recorded moments of our religious history. It is the basis for Torah observance. It is not to be relegated to some digital vacation. It&#8217;s much more than that. And it&#8217;s been observed for millennia. Facebook is 9 years old.</p>
<p>I love the idea that other people are finding value in unplugging. I find it valuable too. But I really don’t like the idea that this is the primary idea of what Shabbos has become about. No. Shabbos is not a day to unplug. It’s a day to <em>plug in</em>. We <em>plug in</em> to our families, our spirituality, extra Torah study, our communities, our progress from week to week. We are to emulate God’s “rest” after a “work week” and experience that which we’ve created.</p>
<p>People who need a Digital Sabbath are welcome to join our eternal Sabbath. But we are the Sabbath hipsters. We were doing it before it was cool and for reasons far more eternal than escaping notifications from Facebook and emails.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are two elements to turning off. One part is to breathe. Experience life. Enjoy life. The other part is tuning in to others. I think both needs must be satisfied. We need our own space and we need to give ourselves to others.</p>
<p>Shabbos actually manages to give us both. Proper prayer is akin to meditation. It focuses us. It’s a way of returning to ourselves. Use the extended prayer service as a way to come in contact with yourself. We follow that up with a kiddush or a Shabbos meal. This is our opportunity to interact with others without distraction. There are no work distractions, there are no cooking distractions, there are no e-distractions. We enjoy our friends and family and give them the human interaction that we all crave. Spend that time well. It&#8217;s not to wasted.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that we take care of both of these needs to maximize our Shabbos experience. Take time for yourself and make time for others. Eliminate the distractions and together we celebrate another week of progress and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Shabbos has a way of celebrating the end of the previous week and setting the the tone for the following week. Digital Sabbaths are great, but the original Sabbath is even better. If you are ever looking for a unique Shabbos experience, come join us at the Shul on the Beach in Venice.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A couple years back I compiled a <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/12/06/rational-reading-and-gift-list/" target="_blank">list of my favorite books that explore and inform the rationalist Orthodox Jewish world</a>. Many people have thanked me for the list, but I get the sense that people think I never read or never have read books that would not fit into the rationalist category. These would be books of Chasidus, stories of inspiration, and mystically influenced philosophy.</p>
<p>But I have read many of those books and many of them have influenced me in a very positive way. So I continue to recommend these books for people seeking more mainstream and less controversial paths within Orthodox Judaism. Some of the books on this list are just one of several favorites from a particular author and I simply chose one of many options. I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with everything in these books, but I do think that they are worth reading and they have all influenced my thinking at some time in my life.<span id="more-7832"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060930853/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0060930853&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank"><img class="alignright  wp-image-7835" alt="books_gift" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/books_gift-600x450.jpg" width="420" height="315" />The Committed Life: Principles for Good Living from Our Timeless Past</a> is my favorite book from this genre. I recommend it at least once per week to people seeking to appreciate the soul of Judaism. This is emotional, relationship oriented Judaism at its best. Rebbetzin Jungreis shares wisdom, stories, humor, and love in this book. I probably read it a dozen times. It&#8217;s a must read.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0933711174/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0933711174&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Generation to Generation: Personal Recollections of a Chassidic Legacy</a> is my favorite book of Chasidic stories. Rabbi Twerski weaves together lessons from his Chasidic pedigree into a book that is inspiring and educational. I&#8217;ve read this book a few times and don&#8217;t know of a better book in this genre.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067972043X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=067972043X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Hasidic Tales of the Holocaust</a> is a famous collection of stories from the Holocaust. Yaffa Eliach wrote this book 25 years ago and it remains the premier book in this genre. I used to read it every Tisha B&#8217;Av. It&#8217;s a tough book but the stories are mostly hopeful and inspirational.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0899068669/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0899068669&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology: Illuminating Expositions on Jewish Thought and Practice</a> is a great Aryeh Kaplan starter kit. So much as his work has become part of the basic philosophy of moderate Orthodox Judaism. His books are footnoted and very well researched. He takes a modern mystical approach to Torah and Mitzvos and gives compelling reasons and explanations for being an Orthodox Jew. He was a prolific writer and I recommend just about all of his books. &#8220;If You Were God&#8221; is one of my favorites so I chose this anthology. I&#8217;ve read this book a few times too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0873068653/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0873068653&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">The Jewish Self</a> is a bit kiruvy, but I written on a very sophisticated level. Rabbi Kagan is known to be extremely intelligent and this book is not an easy read. It&#8217;s written to be intellectual. It succeeds in parts and was too obscure for me in others. But I recommend it because it is the opposite of &#8220;dumbing down&#8221; Judaism. It&#8217;s a challenge to read this book and it inspired me when I read it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/096147727X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=096147727X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Pichifkes: Stories Heard on the Road and by the Way</a> is my favorite Hanoch Teller book. The epitome of feel good, positive, Orthodox Jewish storytelling, this book has a bunch of really great stories. It&#8217;s a very light read, and clearly Teller is loose with the facts, and heavy on embellishments. But he is good at his craft and I must have read this book 8-10 times.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1568710801/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1568710801&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Worldmask</a> changed my life when I read it in high school. I no longer subscribe to the views Rabbi Tatz teaches in this book, but for one who does, there is no better book on God&#8217;s place in our world. I devoured all of Rabbi Tatz&#8217;s writings in my teens and I read each of his books several times. I think Worldmask is his best work and aside from the stylistic issues that make it hard to read for some people, it&#8217;s an excellent book.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/089906115X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=089906115X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Reb Simcha Speaks: Rabbi Simcha Wasserman&#8217;s Insights and Teachings on Vital Principles of Life and Faith</a> is the best Artscroll biography on the market. It&#8217;s actually co-authored by Rabbi Tatz and Yaakov Branfman, so Rabbi Tatz makes this list twice. The book tells the story of the great Rabbi Simcha Wasserman but mostly it makes one feel like they are hearing R&#8217; Simcha speak, hence the title. It&#8217;s a collection of some of his very wise teachings. I don&#8217;t agree with everything in the book, but so much of my life was inspired by this book that it may have been one of the most influential reads of my entire life. I&#8217;ve read it about half a dozen times and my copy of the book has underlines and dog eared pages. It&#8217;s a good book.</p>
<p>So there you have eight books that influenced and inspired me at some point in my life. These are not rationalist books at all. They are the kinds of books your Rosh Yeshiva or rabbi would certainly endorse. So if you are looking for Chanukah gifts for a reader in your life you would appreciate some of the best writing within the more widely accepted views of Orthodox Judaism, here you go.</p>
<p>BONUS BOOK</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140278631X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=140278631X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Out of the Depths: The Story of a Child of Buchenwald Who Returned Home at Last</a> is Rabbi Lau&#8217;s story. It&#8217;s one of the best books I&#8217;ve ever read of any genre and belongs on every Jewish bookshelf. It&#8217;s not really a Torah book per se, it&#8217;s much more of a memoir, but it&#8217;s very inspiring and I strongly recommend it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7218" alt="616hOnPIlZL._SL1000_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/616hOnPIlZL._SL1000_-186x300.jpg" width="186" height="300" /></a>I received a review copy of the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> siddur a few weeks ago. Over the last few weeks I have been test driving the siddur.</p>
<p>For starters, I have never used such a beautiful prayer book. The pages are laid out very well. The typography is excellent and a pleasure to read, no italics thankfully. We are given basic instructions for the service throughout and I found them to be accurate and useful. The translation was decent enough. There were some odd choices, but it&#8217;s like a happy marriage between Artscroll and Koren. What sets apart <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is the photos.</p>
<p>Many of us have seen their &#8220;benchers&#8221; with gorgeous illustrative photos. That concept has now been extended to the Shabbat siddur. It is not without careful consideration and considerable hemming and hawing that the photos were deemed appropriate. Several writers in the introductory remarks justify the inclusion of photos in the siddur. Personally, I think it&#8217;s an acceptable idea and found using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> with its photos mostly a positive experience. Praying with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is an interesting journey and I appreciated the effort to explain the use of photos in the siddur.</p>
<p><span id="more-7054"></span></p>
<p>What struck me most about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> was that it does not idealize charedim. I know this sounds odd when talking about a siddur, but the photos editorialize the text. The ideals expressed in the photos are very Zionist, very religious, and very un-charedi.</p>
<p>For example, we photos of women learning gemara. We see young women IDF soldiers as we sing Eishes Chayil. The elderly man from <em>Na&#8217;ar hayisi, v&#8217;gam zakanti </em>is a non-charedi man as well. Where there are photos of young boys learning Torah, we have young girls learning Torah on the opposing page. There are even photos of women dancing. The photo for <em>sefiras ha&#8217;omer </em>is a field, not a <em>sefirot </em>or any other Zohar centric imagery. Even the Shabbos food in the photos is not charedi. No cholent and kugel here. It&#8217;s like a Mediterranean style feast.</p>
<p>There are scant picture of charedim. The photos of charedim that are in the siddur do not glorify the usualy hallmarks of charedi society. One photo of charedim is of a yeshiva boy dancing at a wedding. Another photo is the famous photo of a rabbi being leered and jeered at by Nazi officers as he stands in his talis and tefilin. It&#8217;s weird using a religious book with so little charedi influence. We are so accustomed to orthodox Judaism being a charedi centric religion. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> turns that on its head. Religious Zionism is seen as the ideal in this siddur.</p>
<p>I took issue with a few of the editorial choices. First, the verse <em>poseach es yadecha umasbia l&#8217;chol chai ratzon </em>is illustrated in the siddur just as it is illustrated in the bencher. We see third world children with hungry eyes and smiling faces on this page. It&#8217;s disconcerting for two reasons. 1) There is tremendous hunger in third world countries. It is ironic at best to be using these photos for this verse. 2. It&#8217;s makes the African, Southeast Asian, and Indian children look like props. Almost everyone else in the siddur is Jewish. Why use these third world children here? It&#8217;s odd. It leads to another strange editorial choice. For the phrase <em>yakiru v&#8217;yedu kol yoshvei tevel </em>they show Buddhists and some Asian people looking upward as if to imply they now see God. I don&#8217;t like this choice either. We have fellow Jews who have yet to discover or believe in God, why are we shifting the focus to these other people?<em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Another quirk is that almost all the liturgy about the Exodus and redemption is reinterpreted to refer to the Holocaust and the State of Israel through photos. In other words, as you are reading about our bondage in Egypt you see Holocaust photos. And as you read about the redemption and ancient entry to the Land of Canaan, you see Zionist pioneers in the modern Israel. Non-Zionists might find this disconcerting. But I would hope that it could subversively influence skeptics about Israel to see the parallels and perhaps embrace the State of Israel more fully.</p>
<p>Of course more of the photos are of outer space and nature panoramas. These photos are not editorial at all and I believe greatly enhance one&#8217;s appreciation of the liturgy.</p>
<p>I think <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> is a great &#8220;change-up&#8221; siddur. I would not use it every week because I think the photos would fade into the pages and we would not even notice them anymore. But I certainly recommend buying at least one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a> siddur and sharing it with your family. Let a different family member use it each week and I am sure your appreciation for the Shabbos prayers will increase.</p>
<p>Buy on Amazon: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9655556573/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=9655556573&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Nehalel BeShabbat</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7137" alt="DoubleLife-Cover" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/DoubleLife-Cover-231x300.jpg" width="231" height="300" /></a>I received a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife: One Family, Two Faiths and a Journey of Hope</a> a few weeks ago. It took a while for me to actually  sit down and read the book but I read it over the weekend and will do my usual review with a side of analysis on the book.</p>
<p>The story is quite intriguing. A Jewish man who makes a living playing music at Church and a Christian woman who does the same fall in love, get married, and end up as orthodox Jews. There&#8217;s a lot of blanks to fill in and the book does a fair job of telling their story.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard not to notice the book&#8217;s most obvious shtick right away. The entire story is told in letters between Harold and Gayle. Harold&#8217;s letters are written in regular typeset and Gayle&#8217;s are in italics. I found this very distracting. I don&#8217;t like italics. But that might be a personal quirk.</p>
<p>The larger issue is that it seems so artificial. Everything is written in letter format. Even things that couples obviously already know about one another. Normal people do not write letters to each other that ask the big questions like &#8220;will we have a Christmas tree or Hanukkah bush in our home&#8221;. Normal couples do not express themselves in letters to the exclusion of anything else. Yet, the book expects us to believe that all these important conversations took place via letters. Either these are real letters, which is just odd or it&#8217;s a gimmick. Making things worse, in order for this to work logistically, the two of them are almost never together. He is writing about his life, she is writing about her life, but because of the format we rarely get a feel for what life is like for the two of them when they are together. Some people might like this format choice, but I did not. It was weird.</p>
<p><span id="more-7134"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> tells the reader a lot about how difficult life can be for intermarried couples. They really don&#8217;t fit in anywhere. The Christian community does not embrace Howard and Gayle and we all know how skeptical the Jewish community can be of intermarried couples. I was surprised that the more liberal branches of Judaism were so antagonistic toward Howard and Gayle. It could just be that this was their experience and others have had different experiences. But reading the book, one would think that Reform and Conservative rabbis and communities are not welcoming to intermarried couples. This might be true in general, but all one can say from the book is that this was the experience of this couple. I would not say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> dishonestly portrays the positions of other denominations to puff up orthodox Judaism, but it at some points it did feel like that a little bit.</p>
<p>The punchline of the book is that the one place that welcomed Howard and Gayle more than any other was the orthodox Jewish community. In the end, despite their reservations, especially Gayle&#8217;s, the couple settled in the orthodox Jewish community. Gayle had a full orthodox conversion and the couple is has been living as orthodox Jews ever since. I do admit to completely breaking down during the conversion scene in the book. It was very emotional and I felt that the book did an excellent job making the moment work as a true climax of the story.</p>
<p>I wish the book would have spent some more time dealing with the theology of becoming an orthodox Jew. Gayle struggles with it quite a bit and we are never really told what changed her mind from resistance to acceptance of orthodox Judaism. I suspect it was mostly an emotional decision but I thought we should have heard a bit more about the transition.</p>
<p>The book tells a great story, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> also seeks to carve out a place for intermarried couples in orthodox Judaism. On the one hand their story seems to say that they are welcome with open arms, but on the other hand it seems that more resources are needed to handle these situations in the orthodox community. To that end <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> promotes the website created by Howard and Gayle for intermarried couples <a href="http://j-journey.org">j-journey.org</a>. The site seems to focus on orthodox conversion exclusively.</p>
<p>This all leads me to the piercing unasked question raised by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. What should be the Jewish approach to intermarriage. In a generation where more Jews intermarry than &#8220;intramarry,&#8221; what is the best way to handle it?</p>
<p>As it stands now, we discourage intermarriage so vociferously that orthodox rabbis will not officiate the ceremony of an intermarried couple. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a> seems to indicate that Reform and Conservative rabbis will not officiate either. What chance do we have of ingratiating an intermarried couple back into Judaism if we can&#8217;t participate in their wedding? I am not saying that we should ignore halacha, God forbid. I am only saying that we stack the deck against the intermarried couple that it becomes extremely difficult to include them in our communities. It is something that we need to work on and I think the Bermans are doing good work by trying to make orthodox Judaism more inclusive for intermarried couples.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCR5JME/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00BCR5JME&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Doublelife</a>. It&#8217;s worthwhile to read the book just to sense of the difficulties that intermarried couples encounter in their spiritual journeys. But more importantly, the book raises questions we must answer about how we handle intermarriage in the modern world. If you have read the book, I welcome your thoughts as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7081" alt="91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/91skXQ90pqL._SL1500_-230x300.jpg" width="230" height="300" /></a>Over the weekend it was reported that a teacher in an orthodox Jewish school in Seattle has been charged with molesting two six year old girls in his class. It is suspected that this fellow molested more than just the two girls but he is only charged with molesting the two girls.</p>
<p>Sex abuse happens everywhere. It is no indictment of a school, community, or family if sex abuse occurs. The test is how sex abuse is dealt with. The most important question is whether the victim is able to articulate that they have been abused and that the victim has a safe place to talk about the abuse. If no one comes forward there is nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>It takes great courage to come forward. But more importantly, it takes education to come forward. Our best defense against abuse is quite simply our children. If they are equipped with the tools necessary to prevent molestation and report it when it happens we have our first two lines of defense in place.</p>
<p>The prosecutor in the case in Seattle attributes the girls&#8217; willingness to come forward and their ability to articulate what happened to a book that is the brainchild of Rabbi Yakov Horowitz, written by Bracha Goetz and illustrated by Tova Leff. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a>. Incredibly, it took years for this book to see the light of day. But now it is endorsed by leading Torah authorities and it must be in every home and every school.</p>
<p><span id="more-7080"></span></p>
<p>In a sensitive way, the book gives children the tools to prevent abuse. When the book was released, I bought several copies of the book for my home and anywhere else I thought it necessary.</p>
<p>Just consider for a moment how incredible it is that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> helped end a cycle of abuse in Seattle. It could do the same in your community. Get the book.</p>
<p>In places where abuse is not reported and not even acknowledged there is too much space for predators to wreak havoc. It is a matter of <em>sakanas nefashos, </em>we must act now. Our children must be educated. There are no excuses. We must educate our most insular communities on the harms of abuse and help them help themselves get out from under the cycle of abuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1422611108/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1422611108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20">Let&#8217;s Stay Safe!</a> is so versatile that it is not only a book that prevents abuse. The book also keeps children safe generally. Rabbi Horowitz shared with me a letter that he received from a learning disabled child thanking him for the book as it helped him in several situations. The letter is so sweet and innocent, it brought tears to my eyes. It is time for us to take this challenge and grab it by the horns. The first step is buying and using this book.</p>
<p>Aside from the book, Rabbi Horowitz has an excellent video on keeping our children safe. Watch that here: <a href="http://youtu.be/LWQHaInsCGk" target="_blank">YouTube</a></p>
