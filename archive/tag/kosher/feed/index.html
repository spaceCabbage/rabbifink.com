				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>About a month ago the Star-K, a world renowned Kashrus agency, announced that they were certifying kosher phones. These phones have no access to the Internet, cannot place or receive text messages, cannot take photos, and most importantly, cannot be hacked to perform any of these tasks.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not troubling to me that people would want a phone that is insulated from certain tasks. Although I think it is an unnecessary measure and perhaps counter productive, I don&#8217;t begrudge people their personal self control restraints.<span id="more-7468"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7469" alt="cert1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/cert1.jpg" /></p>
<p>What is troubling is that a kashrus agency is part of this initiative. A kashrus agency should be concerned with one thing and one thing only. Their singular concern should be the kosher status of the food. I don&#8217;t even think that a kashrus agency must concern itself with humanitarian or other ethical issues that may arise. I have no problem with a secondary agency coming in and providing a secondary level of supervision. But the kosher status of the food cannot be affected by anything other its status as kosher food.</p>
<p>So when I see a kashrus agency entering into the phone market, I see an agency that should be worried about kosher status of food but is now legislating morality. It&#8217;s not even as if the technical skills involved in kosher supervision overlap the neutering of cell phones. They have nothing to do with each other. I don&#8217;t think it is smart for kosher supervision to be intertwined or even related to morality supervision.</p>
<p>Similarly, when kosher supervision agencies make demands on the clientele or ambience of an eating establishment I believe they are overstepping their bounds. There are restaurants that are not allowed to be open at certain hours because they will lose their hechsher if they are open. This is far beyond the scope of kosher supervision. Tell me if the food is kosher and I will decide if I want to patronize the restaurant. That is all we need from a kashrus agency. The stretching of their authority serves no important purpose for the public. It seems to me that it is merely a self-serving, self-righteous way to legislate their morality. If they can legislate phones and who can eat where, what&#8217;s next?</p>
<p>I am not making a slippery slope argument. I am pointing out that there is no logical connection between the kosher status of food and the kosher status of a phone. There is also no relationship between the kosher status of a restaurant and whether teenagers are hanging out. In other words, the kashrus agencies are already legislating their morality. There is no reason to think it only will apply in these two instances because there is no connection between these two things and the kosher status of food.</p>
<p>We need to stop using the word kosher for things other than food. Yes, the word is a general term but it has evolved into a word that describes whether food can be eaten by orthodox Jews who keep kosher. We don&#8217;t eat anything that is not kosher. Using the word kosher for phones and Internet implies that the non-kosher versions are not allowed to be used. This is sophomoric and divisive.</p>
<p>If anything, the kashrus agencies should be concerned with the ethics and morality of the actual food. This is something they have resisted time and time again. I am not recommending they get into the ethics of food business, but if they must expand their business and purview of supervision I think that is the first place they should be looking to legislate seeing as they have the knowledge and expertise to monitor and report on that aspect of food production. But teens mingling and phones? They don&#8217;t belong there at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>After years of research and development, a man-made hamburger was publicly tasted for the first time last week. The burger was not animal flesh, instead it was grown in a laboratory. However, it was grown in a way that mimics the way animals grow their own flesh. Thus, it was pretty close to dead animal meat in flavor and texture.</p>
<p>This incredible scientific breakthrough prompted a plethora of questions. For the religious community with rituals and laws attached to the eating of meat even more questions were asked.<span id="more-7459"></span></p>
<p>It seemed that one could hardly browse the Internet for five seconds without seeing a juicy soundbite (sorry, couldn&#8217;t resist) about whether the meat was kosher or whether is was meat at all. Chabad&#8217;s website had one approach. OU had another approach. Reuters had a third opinion in their article. NBC added another view.</p>
<p>I must have been asked by a dozen people what to make of the man-made meat mystery.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7460" alt="k-bigpic" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/k-bigpic-600x337.gif" /></p>
<p>This is what I think. No one has any idea what they are talking about. Non-scientists have no chance of understanding the precise manner in which this meat was manufactured. I have tried to understand how it all works and it is almost impossible to find the full technical explanation with all the requisite background information. A very smart scientists tried explaining it to me, but even after I got the gist of the process I had more questions about stem cells and other background than I had before he explained it to me. I am pretty confident that Chabad, OU, the Reuters people, and even NBC News reporters don&#8217;t have a clue how this meat is made.</p>
<p>Sure, they  say &#8220;don&#8217;t rely on this for halacha&#8221; or something to that effect, but that makes things even worse. Why offer a meaningless opinion that is based on ignorance? It seems to make a mockery of Jewish law. But Jewish law is very serious and serious people will offer serious opinions on this matter. The proper response for almost the entire population of planet Earth to these eternal questions about man-made meat is &#8220;I am not qualified to render an opinion on this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a thorough understanding of how the meat is made, any discussion of the halachic ramifications of the meat is not even conjecture. It is pure fantasy. Further, deciding the halachic status of this issue will require a breadth of Torah knowledge that is possessed by a mere handful of people on the planet. You can&#8217;t <em>pasken</em> this <em>shyla</em> with Yad Moshe, Google, or the Otzar. This is a brand new question of Jewish law and will need serious investigation into the science and the various tenuously analogous precedents in Jewish law. The Torah does not discuss synthetic meat. And even if it did, who says this meat would be the same as the synthetic meat found in Jewish law?</p>
<p>The only way this question can be seriously answered is with a conference of scientists and rabbis who fit the descriptions above. Scientists who can thoroughly explain how the meat is made and Torah scholars who know <em>kol haTorah kula</em> will need to decide this issue. Anyone else jumping into the discussion is wielding a knife in a nuclear war. It&#8217;s that useless.</p>
<p>If I can, I will try to attain a scientific understanding of how this meat is produced and then perhaps I will be qualified to even ask the question to my (qualified) <em>posek.</em> But until such time, I wouldn&#8217;t dare wade into this very, very deep pool. I think this is the proper policy under the circumstances. We sound more educated and cutting edge when we admit what we don&#8217;t know as opposed to when we pretend we know what we are discussing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6878" alt="trust_action" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/trust_action-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" />The latest twist in the Doheny Kosher Meats scandal is that Shlomo Yehuda Rechnitz, a well known community activist and philanthropist will be buying the butcher shop. He will keep the store from closing down in the wake of the scandal and it is expected that the RCC will reissue their supervision on the store under its new ownership.</p>
<p>The key to this resurrection will be that the quality we have come to expect from Doheny Meats will be maintained and the steady flow of kosher meat will continue from the area&#8217;s largest provider of kosher meat.</p>
<p>This is great news for the consumers of Los Angeles. Our community is blessed to have a man with the magnanimous nature of Shlomo Yehuda Rechnitz. Stepping into this mess is a  wonderful gesture, the likes of which the LA community is accustomed to because we have been spoiled by Shlomo Yehuda Rechnitz.</p>
<p>There are many people who would only buy kosher meat if it was of the quality that is found at Doheny and losing the shop completely would have likely resulted in fewer people observing kosher laws. Keeping the store open is huge for this reason alone. But additionally, it is imperative that the flow of meat continue unabated to avoid a major shortage and price escalations. For the Jewish people of Los Angeles who keep kosher.<span id="more-6877"></span></p>
<p>For Mike Engleman, soon to be former owner of Doheny Kosher Meats, it is a pretty sweet compromise. He will lose his business, but he will be paid for it. He might be hated and villified by many members of the community, but he gets out of a tought situation all while keeping some face and some cash. It could have been much worse for him.</p>
<p>However, there is something that does concern me a bit.</p>
<p>The RCC will not give a hechsher to Doheny if it is owned by Engleman. On the one hand, this is reasonable. Mike has no credibility and might try to pull similar shenanigans again if given the opportunity. The RCC does not owe him a hechsher. They can supervise whom they choose to supervise. If they choose to supervise Rechnitz, they are certainly within their rights to do so.</p>
<p>The minor issue I have is twofold. First of all, I wish that we could just give hechsherim to food, not to people. It seems to me that the butcher is just a mechanical actor. His role is to provide the meat. The supervisor&#8217;s role is to make sure the meat is kosher. I don&#8217;t love the idea that the meat can be technically kosher, but we won&#8217;t supervise the meat and give it our approval because the butcher is a bad guy. I can hear it, but I don&#8217;t love it.</p>
<p>What really gets me is that the RCC is saying that they can no longer trust Engleman. That&#8217;s the rub. They never should have to trust him or anyone they supervise. Their job is <em>not</em> to trust their clients. They must be vigilant and super skeptical about everyone. The fact that their mashgiach was not doing his job and this enabled crooked behavior only proves that we need more and better supervision. From their perspective it seems like they think they need to trust their clients. No! They need to distrust their clients! They shouldn&#8217;t decline to supervise because they don&#8217;t trust someone. The reason we need the RCC to supervise is because we <em>don&#8217;t </em>trust purveyors of kosher food <em>unless</em> they are supervised.</p>
<p>After the Monsey kosher scandal few, if any, improvements were made to the kashrus system in place. They went into the scandal with the attitude that we can trust people who look and act frum and they left the scandal the same way.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if the only public improvement following this scandal was frummer owners of butcher shops. We need better supervision too. Ideally we should be able to trust one another. When it comes to religious law, we say &#8220;one witness is believed&#8221; &#8211; even an involved witness. But kashrus is no longer about religious law. It has become big business. In business we always require two witnesses. To me, this means we should step up the level of supervision and not rely on &#8220;trust&#8221; no matter who the person is that we are trusting.</p>
<p>So while I absolutely concede that the RCC has the right to supervise whomever they choose at their discretion, it concerns me that they seem to express their unwillingness to supervise a shop owned by Engleman simply because they cannot trust him. They can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t trust anybody. That&#8217;s why we need them to do the important job they are doing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6857" alt="breakingnews" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/breakingnews-300x208.jpg" width="300" height="208" />We interrupt this blogcation for this important update on a developing news story.</em></p>
<p>As of Thursday, Doheny Kosher Meats has a new kosher supervision. The rabbi signed on the certificate is a relative unknown in the Los Angeles kosher community. Rabbi Menachem Weiss is the assistant rabbi at Nessah Synagogue and has now inserted himself into the recent Doheny Kosher Meat situation.</p>
<p>I spoke with Rabbi Weiss for a while and what follows is based on our conversation.</p>
<p>First, what actually happened at Doheny Kosher Meats?</p>
<p><span id="more-6854"></span></p>
<p>We have all seen or heard about the surveillance footage. The most important fact is that the video was not filmed at Doheny Kosher. The video shows a fence and I am told by Rabbi Weiss that there is no such fence at Doheny on Pico. The footage was taken from a non-Glatt Kosher butcher in the Valley that is owned by the brother in law of Mike, the owner of Doheny. Mike supplied his brother in law with meat, but Mike insists that there is no legal or practical connection between the two butchers. What happened at the butcher in the Valley was definitely shady, but there is no evidence that anything similar occurred at Doheny.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, only the RCC mashgiach had the keys to the freezer. This is the appropriate protocol and would make it impossible for non-kosher meat to be sold out of Doheny. However, the RCC mashgiach did take breaks from supervising to daven. This is fairly common. In this case, the concerns raised by the surveillance video coupled with the breaks taken by the mashgiach apparently gave the RCC cause to terminate the supervision. There are rumblings of a video showing a car pulling up at Doheny and making a delivery while the mashgiach was away but it seems that no one has seen this video if it exists at all.</p>
<p>As far as the public knows, and we have no reason to think othewise, the RCC does not claim that there was non-kosher meat on site. They claim that protocols were breached and they want to get out of the business of supervising Doheny kosher.</p>
<p>The new supervisor is actually the son of the previous supervisor of Doheny Kosher Meat. A long time ago, the RCC supervised Doheny as a non-Glatt butcher. When RCC decided that they were going all Glatt, they removed their non-Glatt hechsher from Doheny. In the interim, the father of the current rav hamachshir, Rabbi Weiss, provided Doheny with a non-Glatt hechsher. Eventually Doheny capitulated to pressure from the RCC and the public and went all Glatt so RCC took the hechsher over again.</p>
<p>Rabbi Weiss wants to help Doheny earn back the trust of the RCC and the kosher consumer. To that end, their protocols will require two full time mashgichim so that there won&#8217;t be any down time without a mashgiach. New locks have been installed and the only key will be in the hands of the mashgiach. Additionally, more cameras are being installed inside the facility. There will be no blind spots throughout the store. Rabbi Weiss and his father will have full time access to the surveillance footage and will personally monitor it. No deliveries will be made not in the presence of the mashgiach. All meat in the store from before the holiday will be removed and will not be sold as kosher meat. The cameras, mashgichim, and loss on the meat all are at the expense of Doheny Kosher and Rabbi Weiss is not receiving any compensation for his supervision.  Finally, Rabbi Weiss is requiring that Doheny completely disassociate from the butcher in the valley in the surveillance footage.</p>
<p>Rabbi Weiss is not trying to get into the hashgacha business. He is trying to help Doheny get back in business and find the good graces of a skeptical public. Hopefully, the RCC will take note of all the new and improved protocols and reissue its supervision to Doheny Kosher Meat. Rabbi Weiss has not decided how they will proceed after the holiday.</p>
<p>It seems that the problems with Doheny Kosher Meat are more procedural than substantive. Until the RCC makes a substantive claim there is no reason to think otherwise. Under the new protocols there should be no doubt as to the kosher status of the meat.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6836" alt="store-front" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/store-front.jpg" width="293" height="200" />As of Sunday March 24, 2013 at 3 PM, Doheny Kosher Meats is no longer under the rabbinic supervision of the RCC. In a statement released to the greater Los Angeles community, the RCC said that the hechsher was removed for cause.</p>
<p>KTLA news reports that a private investigator filmed Doheny Kosher receiving empty boxes with kosher labeling on them and a stash of kosher labels. It appears that this is the extent of what has been discovered. This is a violation of the agreement between Doheny and the RCC thus invalidating their supervision. It also implies that Doheny has been receiving non-kosher meat deliveries and replacing the non-kosher labels with kosher labels.</p>
<p>However, it does not seem that any non-kosher meat was found in Doheny nor were there any deliveries of non-kosher meats filmed. Therefore, the status of the meat purchased before the breach of protocol was discovered is still considered kosher. This is because a kosher store has a &#8220;status&#8221; (chazaka) of kosher until there is evidence to the contrary. There is only evidence of a breach of protocol so the entire store is now suspect but before this breach was discovered the halachic status quo remains intact and the food is considered kosher. Pots and dishes are also considered kosher.</p>
<p>At this point, nothing other than the breach of protocol is certain. It is possible, although very remote, that this all an honest mix up.</p>
<p>In contrast with the Monsey Kosher Scandal, there was no non-kosher meat discovered. In Monsey, chickens from non-kosher distributors were discovered on site. This meant that there was no longer &#8220;doubt&#8221; about some of the meat and the halachic status was invalidated.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Doheny was involved in a kashrus dustup when it was forced to go all Glatt lest it lose its hechsher. They complied.</p>
<p>Right now there are four unanswered questions.</p>
<p>1) Was non-kosher meat delivered to Doheny and was it distributed to its consumers?</p>
<p>2) Who hired the private detective and why?</p>
<p>3) Why did it take a private investigator to discover this breach and not the paid mashgiach?</p>
<p>4) Everyone said Doheny meats tasted the best. I&#8217;ve heard this for years. They said the same thing about the guy in Monsey&#8217;s meats. Why do non-kosher meats taste better?<span id="more-6835"></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kosher-pork-233.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4488" title="kosher-pork-233" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/kosher-pork-233.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="288" /></a>You may have heard about the humorous mix-up that led to some pork being labeled as kosher. Yes. You heard right. The pork was not actually kosher, it was mislabeled. It would have been hard to fool somebody as it clearly said &#8220;pork&#8221; on the label.</p>
<p>The usual suspects among the orthodox Jewish blogs tab articles on the mix-up and the comments ran the gamut from incensed to amused and from serious to satire.</p>
<p>One might like to think that these comments, sometimes lucid, frequently enlightening, often written in broken English, other times written with contempt for the outside world remain within the virtual box of orthodox Judaism. This is not the case.<span id="more-4487"></span></p>
<p>I have heard from prominent people who work within the interfaith community that these orthodox Jewish new sites are monitored and mined. Our comments are being read by anyone who is interested and many are interested.</p>
<p>Our news sites, especially <a href="vosizneias.com" target="_blank">Vosizneias</a> have been quoted in the mainstream press and even comments have been noticed or quoted in the press.</p>
<p>The New Yorker, which I don&#8217;t read, mostly because when I do, I haven&#8217;t the foggiest idea what they are talking about, ran a story on the reactions to the kosher pork mix-up. I was able to understand this article. It has the highbrow humor that I usually don&#8217;t get, but since I know all about the kosher pork, I think I was able to follow.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was informed about this article because someone found it offensive. I did not. You can read it and let me know if you think it is offensive to orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>But I am more concerned with two much more important issues.</p>
<p>1) Our comments on VIN and other similar sites are being monitored. It behooves the commenters and the moderators of these sites to be sure that nothing that is published will harm relationships between Jews (orthodox or not) and non-Jews (and also between orthodox and non-orthodox Jews). I have a feeling that many commenters assume that their words are sealed within the vacuum of the orthodox Jewish world. They are not. Many of the remarks may not be sincere, they just be flip, but they can read the wrong way and they are being read.</p>
<p>2) Our English is horrible. The New Yorker copied and pasted random comments into their article. The comments sound like English is the second language of their authors. For many it is, but isn&#8217;t it time that all orthodox Jews living in America learned basic English? Would it not be better for Klal Yisrael if we could express ourselves in a respectful articulate manner? I think so.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy the article. It is a bit humorous and for once we can all read a New Yorker article and understand the context. And please be careful about what you write online and how it is written.</p>

<p>See: <a href="http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2011/05/04/agudath-israel-statement-on-magen-tzedek/">Agudath Israel statement on “Magen Tzedek”</a>. Of course Agudath Israel can&#8217;t post it on their own website because they don&#8217;t have one since the Internet is prohibited. Nonetheless they managed to leak the statement to the sinners who have blogs and news sites so that pretty much every single orthodox Jew will see the statement on the Internet. Ahhhh, the games we play&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, the statement makes a gross misrepresentation of Magen Tzedek, misunderstands its purpose, injects non-existent agendas into an otherwise somewhat worthy cause and as per usual, weakens the clout with which orthodox Jewish leaders have in the lives of orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>The statement makes the claim that Magen Tzedek seeks to redefine Kashrut and by implication, do away with the orthodox hechsher system. The effort is called a brazen one and its purpose is to undermine the religious tradition. The statement tells us to <em>&#8220;regard the new seal for what it is, a falsification of the Jewish religious heritage, and treat it accordingly.&#8221;<span id="more-4204"></span></em></p>
<p>I am embarrassed for them.</p>
<p>Hechsher Tzedek is not what Agudath Israel thinks it is. As I wrote way back when it was announced in December (See: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2010/12/16/kosher-supervision-and-ethics-supervision/">Kosher Supervision and Ethics Supervision</a>) the seal is supposed to run ALONGSIDE traditional hechsher symbols. The traditional symbol vouches for the kashrus of the food per halacha and the Hechsher Tzedek symbol vouches for the ethical concerns in mass food production.</p>
<p>It is NOT an attempt to undermine the mesorah. It is NOT a redefinition of kashrut and quite frankly, seems necessary in many instances to augment the failing oversight of the government in food production practices.</p>
<p>It has been argued that the new symbol would perhaps cause an unwitting kosher consumer to trust the hechsher Tzedek for the halachic kashrus and cause them to sin by eating food that is not in fact kosher, rather is ethically produced. In my opinion this is a ridiculous concern. No responsible kosher eating consumer buys food if there is a random kosher symbol printed on the label. All kosher consumers know that they need to vet any and all kosher symbils before relying on them. Hechsher Tzedek would be no different. There are already plenty of kosher symbols that are not relied upon by huge swaths of the Jewish community. I see no reason to be fearful that this particular symbol will cause sin.</p>
<p>I believe this statement was a mistake. The greater Jewish community would benefit from a Hechsher Tzedek alongside traditional kosher supervision. Agudath Israel is needlessly poking its head into a non-issue. By doing so they lose credibility and cause anguish and animosity among Jews for no reason. (And wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if Agudath Israel spoke with such gusto against sex abusers and orthodox Jewish criminals&#8230;?)</p>
<p>I hope Agudath Israel rethinks this statement.</p>

I have heard of it but have never seen it. It doesn&#8217;t sound very good. But apparently it&#8217;s pretty popular. I would imagine for all the train-wreck TV fans out there, this is the perfect show.</p>
<p>The show finds horrible home cooks, teaches them culinary skills and pits them against each other in cooking competitions. One of the contestants was introduced to the viewers via his burnt cholent. Joshie Berger grew up in Boro Park and his family is Chasidic. These days Joshie is not Chasidic at all.<span id="more-3871"></span></p>
<p>The Atlantic has an article noting some of Joshie&#8217;s finer moments on the show. The article is mostly positive. But not positive in a Jewish sense. It is positive in a cultural sense. The author commends Joshie for stepping outside his comfort zone and eating shellfish. In fact Joshie is portrayed as one who is reluctant to eat non-kosher foods. The article says a &#8220;highpoint of this past season&#8221; was when Joshie overcame his aversion to treyf.</p>
<p>Some high point.</p>
<p>Joshie was a quick learner and in the end he came out on top.</p>
<p>It can be very hard for those who leave Chasidic Judaism to succeed on the outside. They have a limited education, limited social skills that are needed on the outside and they speak English as a second language. So for Joshie to emerge victorious is in fact quite impressive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also nice that, according to the article, Joshie&#8217;s old friends were rooting for him to win.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that when reading the article my stomach turned several times because of Joshie&#8217;s choices that led him away from his heritage. It&#8217;s sad.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s one thing that Joshie has been preaching that is absolutely correct. Orthodox Jews need to eat better. Amen to that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/tzedek_l1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3487" title="tzedek_l" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/tzedek_l1.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="247" /></a>The Forward is reporting that a new certification agency is set to begin certifying kosher food with an additional symbol called a Magen Tzedek denoting that the certified food meets their ethical standard. The guidelines for earning a Magen Tzedek require food companies to meet the Magen Tzedek standard in 5 major categories: labor, animal welfare, consumer issues, corporate integrity and environmental impact. The standards are extensive. They fill a 150 slide PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this innovation and have mixed feelings about it.</p>
<p>My first thought is that certifying businesses as ethical is a nice thing to do.<span id="more-3485"></span> There are people who would only support a business if they were confident that the business was acting legally and ethically in all of its facets. Having that information verified by a third party seems like a great idea.</p>
<p>My second thought is that the standards are completely arbitrary. There are 5 categories and they are all issues and I think they  are all important. But why are these the 5 issues the certification cares about? Moreover, not only are the 5 issues arbitrary, but the standard by which they are judged must be completely arbitrary as well. Take &#8220;environmental impact&#8221;. How much environmental impact is acceptable? Based on what is that standard established? Take &#8220;corporate integrity&#8221;. Does that include secretaries who nick paper clips and pens? What if the CEO makes a disproportionate amount of money? Where are the standards coming from?</p>
<p>In contrast, kosher certification is based on rabbinic sources. The sources are all agreed upon. There are minor discrepancies in application, but the standards are, for lack of a better word, standardized.</p>
<p>I am wary of any standard that is not standardized. I could be wrong. But I don&#8217;t see how things that are by definition arbitrary can be useful tools in a certification program.</p>
<p>Personally, I think a &#8220;whistle-blowing&#8221; organization would be more useful. Find out the facts. Report the facts. Then allow the consumer to decide whether the information is something that would affect their decision. This avoids the arbitrariness of the standards but still achieves the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>My third thought is that the reaction of the orthodox Jewish media is heinous. For example the headline on Matzav.com read: <a title="Permanent Link to Left-Wing Non-Torah Liberal Jewish Factions to Test New Magen Tzedek Kashrus “Ethics Seal” in Kosher Marketplace" rel="bookmark" href="http://matzav.com/left-wing-non-torah-liberal-jewish-factions-to-test-new-magen-tzedek-kashrus-ethics-seal-in-kosher-marketplace">Left-Wing Non-Torah Liberal Jewish Factions to Test New Magen Tzedek Kashrus “Ethics Seal” in Kosher Marketplace</a>. As I sarcastically posted on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/e_fink/status/15444439279341568" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, this headline is slightly biased.</p>
<p>Why should it matter to an orthodox Jew if a good idea comes from Left-Wingers? Or even if it&#8217;s Non-Torah? Plenty of really great ideas are Non-Torah. And people who demand ethical business practices are to be considered &#8220;Liberal Jewish Factions&#8221;? Why? Further, the standards may be arbitrary, but they are also based mostly on Torah principles!</p>
<p>But what bothered me most of all is that lately, orthodox Jews are drawn to all sorts of stringencies that make them feel better about their observance of Torah. So why would it be offensive to them to add this stringency? Isn&#8217;t it reasonable to be strict about treatment of employees? Proper treatment of animals is required by the Torah! If corporate integrity means &#8220;honesty in business&#8221; well that is also a Torah requirement! Not wasting the earth&#8217;s resources? That&#8217;s also in the Torah. (See <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/22/earth-day/" target="_blank">Earth Day</a>.)</p>
<p>So why the uproar?</p>
<p>I am very interested to see how this certification progresses and if it begins to certify products in the orthodox Jewish marketplace. I hope that I will be able to post a follow up after this certification hits the market place and begins to make an impact (or fades away).</p>

(<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/magazine/10Kosher-t.html" target="_blank">Keeping It Kosher</a>) In my opinion the article made three basic points.</p>
<p>1) It is possible for a diverse, upscale kosher restaurant to exist and operate successfully.</p>
<p>2) The community in Crown Heights is not diverse and suffers tensions with its non-Jewish neighbors.</p>
<p>3) The kosher supervision of the restaurant oversees the status of the food and also tries to control the way the clientele behave and dress while in the restaurant.<br />
<span id="more-2936"></span></p>
<p>Point number one is correct. There are other upscale kosher restaurants that cater to all sorts of people and I for one, would like to see more places a kashrus observant business person could take non-kashrus observant friends, clients, partners and bosses without apologizing for subpar food, service and ambiance.</p>
<p>Point number two is not limited by any means to Crown Heights. I have noticed that the more insular a community becomes, the less tolerant they become of others. Perhaps it is more ironic in Crown Heights because of the international (probably soon to be intergalactic) reputation that Chabad shluchim have earned as being open and welcoming to all people.</p>
<p>But it is not a problem specific to Chabad. All Jewish neighborhoods that limit interactions to people that are overwhelmingly similar to one another suffer from a nearsighted view of humanity. It is not just between Jews and non-Jew, it is perhaps even more profound when the differences between Jew and Jew and even more minute differences between Orthodox Jews create closed communities that shun outsiders.</p>
<p>For 500 years we tried to get out of the ghetto. Now that we are out all we want to do retreat into our own self-made ghettos&#8230;</p>
<p>The value of diversity has been challenged. One reason diversity is good is because it forces everyone to be tolerant. Without diversity a ghetto mentality has room to grow. This appplies universally. Orthodox Jews, to WASPy Country Clubs, the Inner City and Suburbia. Monotony breeds contempt.</p>
<p>If you are interested in point number three you will need to go to DovBear: <a href="http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2010/10/three-points-on-nyt-mag-article-on.html">Three Points on the NYT Mag Article on Basil</a>. Be warned, if you are not an orthodox Jew, you may not understand what I have written. This is because it involves some intricacies of Jewish Law. No offense.</p>

Folks are generally more friendly and generous under the &#8220;guise&#8221; of Holiday Spirit.</p>
<p>Seeing as Rosh Hashana (the Jewish New Year) is a mere 9 days away, if we were Christian and the New Year was 9 days away, we would be knee-deep in the &#8220;Holiday Spirit&#8221;. A congregant of mine told me an anecdote that would fit neatly in the &#8220;Holiday Spirit&#8221; if we had an equivalent.<span id="more-2769"></span></p>
<p>This fellow was shopping at the local butcher (Western Kosher) and he noticed an orthodox Jewish woman had stacked her yogurt on top of her chicken. Now, most orthodox Jews don&#8217;t think twice about that kind of move, but there are some people who are new to religious Judaism who prefer to keep their milk and meat products separate in their shopping carts. (No, there is no reason to do this, it just happens that fellow in the story does separate his meat and milk in his shopping cart.) So the fellow thinks about saying something to the nice lady but thought it was a silly thing to bring to her attention because he realized that there is nothing wrong with stacking cold yogurt in a package on top on cold chicken in a package.</p>
<p>By now, she had caught his attention and he noticed that she was holding a list with at least 8 or 9 items. Her overhears that woman say to the manager &#8220;Please put $1000 in the Schwartz* account. $1000 in the Goldberg account. $1000 in the Cohen account.&#8221; and so she went for a few minutes, quite simply crediting at least 8 or 9 families with $1000 out of her own pocket. This fellow was witnessing a true act of charity. Charity given in the most respectful way with no begging, handouts or embarrassment. An estimated $10,000 went to the less fortunate of Los Angeles last week from this woman alone.</p>
<p>That is a universal Holiday Spirit.</p>
<p>*names changed (duh)</p>

One relates to its kosher certification and one relates to an endorsement deal with a famous athlete.</p>
<p>Is there a connection?</p>
[Disclaimer: Please read the rest of this post tongue-in-cheek. I'm no expert on writing in general and certainly not humorous writing. This post is intended to be 13% information and 87% light hearted banter.]
<p>About six weeks ago <a href="http://www.vosizneias.com/39737/2009/10/14/new-york-report-tootsie-roll-gatorade-to-get-major-kosher-certification/" target="_blank">it was reported that Gatorade (and Tootsie Rolls) was going to become kosher</a> (VIN). <span id="more-1806"></span>This means that a kosher supervising agency will verify that the ingredients and machinery used in Gatorade do not contain any non-Kosher ingredients. They will monitor the production of the plant and will place their stamp of approval on the product. Jewish consumers who do not eat food or drink without a kosher symbol verification will now be able to drink Gatorade. Isn&#8217;t that exciting?</p>
<p>I wondered, as anybody else who keeps kosher, if Gatorade will need to adjust their formula or if the certification just verifies that the elixir was kosher all along&#8230; I am afraid I will never know.</p>
<p>The word kosher is commonly used to refer to food items and whether they are technically allowed to be eaten by kosher observant Jews. But the truth is that kosher means much more than that. The word means &#8220;fit&#8221; and it applies to any and everything. The word kosher can be used as a replacement for &#8220;appropriate&#8221; or &#8220;okay&#8221; in situations besides the typical food usage. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/02/19/kosher-navigation/" target="_blank">I wrote about this in the early stages of the blog when the Kosher GPS was announced.</a></p>
<p>It turns out that Gatorade may or may not have needed to make their formual kosher. But they did need to make their endorsements kosher.</p>
<p>Gatorade announced today that they are dropping Tiger Woods as a spokesperson for their product. The company will discontinue the Tiger Focus drink. It is being reported that the decision to drop Tiger preceded his current brouhaha involving the many women in his personal life. According to ABC News, a publication was informed of this decision 2 days prior to the initial incident at Tiger Woods&#8217; home. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory?id=9283979" target="_blank">You can read the AP story on ABC News</a>.</p>
<p>All this means to me is that Gatorade knew about the women and personal problems before we did.</p>
<p>More importantly, Gatorade wants to project a more kosher image across the board. Their drink will have the kosher certification and their spokesperson roster will not include the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/12/02/the-eye-of-the-tiger-fans/" target="_blank">latest sports villain, Tiger Woods</a>.</p>
<p>Gatorade becoming kosher to drink and dropping Tiger Woods? Most definitely NOT a coincidence&#8230;</p>

<p>It is incredible how many people know about Shabbos and now have a grasp of some of the concepts. Eventually we are going to do a Shabbos Connections with community wide Shabbos participation and invitations. Until then I guarantee if you want a Shabbos meal just stop in the Shul on the Beach during services. You will be invited by someone!</p>
