				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/P3080110.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7250" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/P3080110-300x240.jpg" width="300" height="240" /></a>The war over MK Rabbi Dov Lipman is rising to a crescendo. The mouthpiece of the Ultra-Orthodox American establishment is the Yated Ne&#8217;eman. The Yated and its Matzav.com website are <a href="http://www.yated.com/dov-lipman--bad-choice-to-keynote-rca-convention.7-977-7-.html" target="_blank">leading the charge to discredit and demonize Lipman</a> in every way possible. Meanwhile, the Centrist Orthodox Americans are watching from the sidelines as they watch a potential hero go to zero. The Modern Orthodox Jewish community is becoming enraged as they see their values trudged upon by their charedi brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mess.</p>
<p>Two important voices from the moderate camp have invited Lipman to speak. The RCA Convention will be headlined by Lipman and the BAYT Shul in Toronto is featuring Lipman as a Scholar in Residence the last week in June.</p>
<p>For these grievous sins, Lipman, the RCA, and BAYT have come under a severe assault of attacks from the Yated and Matzav. Articles calling for boycotts of these fine institutions, articles condemning the the decision makers and rabbinic leadership of both institutions, and of course articles enumerating the horrible sins of Lipman as ammunition for their war appear regularly in their pages.<span id="more-7249"></span></p>
<p>The thrust of their arguments against Lipman focus on isolated incidents, out of context quotes, but most of all guilt by association.</p>
<p>I think this is a very important point. There are pundits who &#8220;connect the dots&#8221; to spin conspiracy tales on a daily basis. People believe it. Others just disqualify the opinions or ideas of others because they have a second cousin who gave money to someone else who has a nephew in Al Qaeda. People seem to be okay with this too. For some, guilt by association is actual guilt. For these people, who you know and with whom you associate determine your credibility.</p>
<p>Obviously, this parlor game is ridiculous. If you search long enough you can connect any two people in the world. Guilt by association is terrible way to make a point. Assuming that the two people are associated, there is no evidence that they agree on anything. They could hate each other. Or they could agree on one thing and completely disagree on another. It&#8217;s pure scare tactics and dishonesty to impugn people because of loose ties or even strong ties that they may have with others who might be different or even dangerous.</p>
<p>The same exact thing is happening now in the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish media.</p>
<p>Lipman is in the same party as Yair Lapid? And Lapid&#8217;s father, Tommy, was virulently anti-orthodox? Lipman must also be anti-orthodox! The RCA asked Lipman to speak? The RCA must agree with everything Yair Lapid says too! BAYT invited Lipman for Shabbos? BAYT is clearly anti-Torah.</p>
<p>These are the arguments being made.</p>
<p>The non-Ultra-Orthodox Jews don&#8217;t play this game. They would prefer to hear challenging ideas and thought provoking conversation than disqualify any dissenters by way of guilt by association. Does the RCA agree with every single thing Lipman says? Probably not. No two people agree on everything! Does BAYT co-sign every single thing Lipman has ever done? Of course not. But both institutions pride themselves on appealing to a broad spectrum of orthodox Jews and care passionately about matters of great communal importance. Thus, Lipman is a great candidate for a talk in both places.</p>
<p>But the uber-charedi world it doesn&#8217;t work like that. Unless someone is 100% kosher, they can&#8217;t get to the table. No matter how salient their points may be, they don&#8217;t have the opportunity to be heard. Worse, when two people are associated, and person A says or does something controversial, everyone runs to person B and asks if person B &#8220;holds of&#8221; what person A did. It&#8217;s ridiculous! People can disagree. People can have different opinions. Why is it even expected that if person B associates with person A they would agree with everything person A does? It makes no sense.</p>
<p>This is the best way to seek and destroy any dissent or debate. There is no room for dissent or debate when as soon as someone dissents or debates all that person&#8217;s associates are impugned and they are forced to distance themselves from the dissenter or debater. Nothing could be more chilling.</p>
<p>The other way is to analyze ideas, not people. Rambam writes &#8220;Hear truth from whoever says it.&#8221; These are wise words. The source of an idea is only secondary to the content of the idea. Great people can say stupid things and stupid people can say great things. It&#8217;s terribly insecure and unwise to automatically eliminate so many voices simply because they are guilty by association.</p>
<p>I believe that this is the primary issue that is at play here. Since Lipman is straddling two worlds, he is by definition persona non grata in the Ultra-Orthodox world. One can&#8217;t be for Torah and also cavort with people who are not for Torah. Therefore he is automatically wrong and all the rules of fair play and honesty are no longer relevant. He is a threat who must be stopped. He is not a voice that must be answered. This is the only explanation for the completely disingenuous and false attacks against Lipman.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an old argument within orthodox Judaism. For some time now there has been resistance against fostering debate and conversation amongst people with differing views and perspectives. Worse, it has long been established that orthodox Rabbis may not sit on organizations with non-orthodox Jews lest it be perceived as endorsement of non-orthodox values. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a great tactic, nor do I think it&#8217;s wise in the long run. Writing for Tradition Magazine, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/23256285" target="_blank">Rabbi Shubert Spero addressed this issue in 1966</a> and we can see how things have changed since then. Rabbi Spero was writing about engaging non-orthodox Jews. Engaging orthodox Jews wasn&#8217;t an issue in 1966.</p>
<p>Look where we are today. We still don&#8217;t participate with non-orthodox Jews. In fact the <a href="http://matzav.com/the-rca-and-the-women-of-the-wall" target="_blank">Yated recently addressed this very issue</a>,Â going so far as to compare Reform Jews in the mid-20th century with the Women of the Wall and MK Lipman. The Yated takes for granted that it would be prohibited to work together with Reform Jews, the additional point was that this rule would also apply to WoW and Lipman. In 1966 Rabbi Spero was hopeful that orthodox Jews could participate with non-orthodox Jews. Here we stand in 2013 and orthodox Jews cannot participate with orthodox Jews who associate with non-orthodox Jews! It seems to me we are going in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>What will it take to change the tenor of discourse in the orthodox Jewish community? I don&#8217;t know. Maybe an Asifa. An <em>achdus</em> Asifa.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><em><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/internet_censor_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-7047" alt="internet_censor_1" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/internet_censor_1-300x204.jpg" width="300" height="204" /></a>(Back to <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2013/04/30/pharisees-sadducees-and-karaites/" target="_blank">Pharisees and Sadducees</a> tomorrow. Maybe.)</em></p>
<p>Today is May 1. That means that it&#8217;s the day Paul Miller returns to the Internet. Around the same time as the <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/20/the-asifa-is-done-i-was-fooled/" target="_blank">Internet Asifa last year</a>, a blogger for <a href="theverge.comhttp://www.theverge.com/2013/5/1/4279674/im-still-here-back-online-after-a-year-without-the-internet" target="_blank">The Verge</a> decided to leave the world of the Internet for one full year. It was his hope that during this year he would embark on a year of self-discovery and return to his true self and not the Internet Paul Miller.</p>
<p>This was a happy coincidence for those who promoted the Asifa but because they viewed his journey as a vindication for their perspective that the Internet was horrible and responsible for destroying society. The Asifa even gets a mention in his article.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been one year and Paul Miller has returned to the Internet. Paul Miller has written an overview essay of what he learned during his year away from the Internet and some of the things he discovered may surprise the Ichud Hakehilos. But they should not surprise people that use the Internet and people that are aware of the problems on the Internet because those people realize that the Internet is not a problem nor is the solution is a tool and no matter what problems one as they want to be solved or avoided by using Internet.<span id="more-7046"></span></p>
<p>Miller writes that at first he was so amazed at how into he was with life and he felt bad leaving Internet was definitely a positive idea. He was reading more he was enjoying life more he was doing the things that he always felt he wanted to do but the Internet took him away from those things. In many respects the first few months after leaving the Internet with the best months of Miller&#8217;s life. But nirvana was elusive and slowly his life returned to its normal state as it was during Internet use , albeit without the Internet.Â The feelings of success gave way to feelings of failure.</p>
<p>It might feel good not to be bombarded with email, and text messages, Facebook notifications, but after a few weeks of using regular mail we become equally bombarded with snail mail and voice messages. While it may be exciting to reach out to people in person or only by the phone, it can be quite upsetting not to keep up relationships with people around the world who don&#8217;t have regular access to phones or don&#8217;t write letters but would have easy access to the Internet. Miller&#8217;s comment about Facebook friends is quite revealing:<em> &#8220;So much ink has been spilled deriding the false concept of a &#8220;Facebook friend,&#8221; but I can tell you that a &#8220;Facebook friend&#8221; is better than nothing.<strong>&#8220;Â </strong></em></p>
<p>It turns out that not having the Internet makes life the same, just without the Internet. It doesn&#8217;t solve anything, it doesn&#8217;t make any problems disappear, it just changes your problems. Our world is a world with Internet. Our lives are shared and experienced through the Internet. This is neither good nor bad, this is just a fact. There are good and bad ways to live a life without the Internet and there are good and bad ways to live with the Internet.</p>
<p>The most important line of the entire essay is this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&#8220;What I do know is that I can&#8217;t blame the internet, or any circumstance, for my problems. I have many of the same priorities I had before I left the internet: family, friends, work, learning. And I have no guarantee I&#8217;ll stick with them when I get back on the internet â I probably won&#8217;t, to be honest. But at least I&#8217;ll know that it&#8217;s not the internet&#8217;s fault. I&#8217;ll know who&#8217;s responsible, and who can fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t this go against everything that we were told last year around the time of the Asifa? When we were told that our problems are because of the Internet and that our problems that we have in our lives can be solved by removing the Internet? Seems to me that a lot of what we were told has been demonstrated to be false in the case of Paul Miller.</p>
<p>But it is so much easier to blame the Internet for problems. It&#8217;s so much easier to blame something that we can just take out of our homes and then hope that everything will be all right. We wish there was a magic bullet, or a pill to just swallow. Get rid of the Internet and everything falls into place. This fails for two very important reasons. First of all, the Internet is not going anywhere and no matter how hard you try to get rid of it, the Internet will still be there. But more importantly the Internet is not the source of our problems. Our problems are more directly related to poor education, subpar parenting, shoddy morals and values, and the very narrow path or orthodox Judaism. All those problems exists with or without the Internet.</p>
<p>I have no problem whatsoever with groups of people organizing efforts to make the Internet safer for children and for adults. But to portrays the Internet as the devil and to assume that if we would just excise this devil from our midst everything will be fine is a completely destructive attitude towards the Internet and towards our communal issues. I am certain that there is not a single problem in our community that can be solved by getting rid of the Internet. I am equally certain that there are many problems that we have that can be solved by using the Internet.</p>
<p>Let us learn from Paul Miller&#8217;s experiment, the Internet is not our problem. Our problems exist within the institutionalization Orthodox Judaism, in our families, in our education system, and pretty much throughout all the areas of Jewish life. Our efforts must be focused on fixing those problems. Placing our energies into banning, or blocking, or demonizing the Internet is is just doing the exact same thing Paul Miller did when he took that a year awfully Internet. Now that he is back and he has told us what it is like, I am pretty sure that we can safely say that banning the Internet is not the right way to solve our problems. Problems don&#8217;t disappear when the Internet disappears.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/internet-safety.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6234" title="internet-safety" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/internet-safety-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a>One of the premises for the Asifa and the subsequent edicts that have been issued severely regulating the Internet, according to highly placed spokespeople like [redacted], is that the Internet is an inherent danger and the secular world is completely at a loss as to how to deal with the Internet. Luckily, the right wing orthodox Jewish community is available to sound the alarm and protect ourselves and everyone else from the cesspool that is the world wide web. If not for the holy Asifa and the &#8220;halachos&#8221; of the Internet the entire world is at risk. [See:Â <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/04/29/in-support-of-the-internet-asifa/">In Support of the Internet Asifa</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/20/the-asifa-is-done-i-was-fooled/">The Asifa is Done: I Was Fooled</a>]
<p>I dispute this premise.</p>
<p>People in the secular world have been dealing with the challenges of the Internet for a decade and a half. This is not a new problem. New computers come with features to address these issues. Parents are able to attend local seminars and meetings to discuss and learn about how to manage the Internet in their lives. There are articles and books on Internet addiction. There is a wealth of material on Internet safety in the secular world.</p>
<p>Smart people don&#8217;t need an Asifa.</p>
<p>Whether or not one likes President Obama as a president or a person, he seems to have a good grasp of this issue. In a recent NY Times article, the First Daughters are profiled and the parenting techniques of their parents are discussed.<span id="more-6233"></span></p>
<p>The Obamas have a lot of rules.</p>
<p>This is their technology rule:</p>
<p><em>Technology is for weekends. Malia may use her cellphone only then, and she and her sister cannot watch television or use a computer for anything but homework during the week.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a great rule. And they came up with it without attending the Asifa. Remarkable.</p>
<p>I am not saying this rule is perfect for all orthodox Jewish kids. I am saying that a reasonable rule is not an impossible thing to come up with on one&#8217;s own. The need for a multi-million dollar convention to teach common sense speaks to a greater danger than the Internet in our lives. It speaks to a lack of common sense.</p>
<p>I personally know of children in the right wing orthodox Jewish community with full access to the Internet. There is no supervision over this access. They have iPods and iPads and iPhones before their age reaches double digits. They play on the DS or Wii on every night of the week. They watch videos and play Jetpack Joyride until the wee hours of the night. I am talking about pre-teens. When they get older, they have even more access. This is just plain dumb.</p>
<p>We need more common sense when it comes to technology. If the Asifa taught us anything, it&#8217;s that for some reason, people are oftentimes incapable of making intelligent basic parenting choices. That is a lot scarier than the Internet.</p>
<p>The underlying premise of the Asifa should not have been that the rest of the world needs our help with dealing with the Internet. Their premise should have been thatÂ <em>weÂ </em>need to look to the secular world for help with dealing with the Internet.</p>
<p>I outlined some of my suggestions here:Â <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/08/29/jewish-action-magazine-takes-on-social-media/">Jewish Action Magazine Takes on Social Media</a></p>
<p>By the way, the Obamas have some more rules that we can all learn from. Read the article in the NY Times.</p>

The Siyum was almost perfect and I am considered a critic.</p>
<p>All kinds of orthodox Jews were there. Some were dressed in chasidic garb, others in yeshivish garb, many in professional attire, some in casual wear, others in business casual styles. Every kind of hat and yarmulka was represented. I saw them all with my own eyes. At one point everyone in the stadium was dancing and you could see circles of as diverse a group of orthodox Jews one could find. Truly, the Torah is the great equalizer and celebrating a Siyum HaShas brought (almost) all of us together.</p>
<p>Agudath Israel of America put on a spectacular show and I was greatly impressed by their production. The Siyum was as professional event I have ever attended. The speakers mostly spoke beautifully. The video tributes were slick and very well done. The music was excellent. The programs were lovely. The overall attitude and atmosphere of the Siyum was positive and filled with joy.</p>
<p>That is the way it is done. Wow.<span id="more-6096"></span></p>
<p>I want to mention a few particular specifics that made an impact on me.</p>
<p>First, the wow moment. I, like so many others, arrived late. But it was to my benefit that I arrived late. The stadium was probably 95% full when I got there and when I emerged from the tunnel to the stands, the experience of popping my head into a stadium filled to the brim with my brothers and sisters took my breath away. It was awe-inspiring. That moment brought tears to my eyes. That was before I heard a single word of Torah or a single bar of music.</p>
<p>Second, the primary speakers were outstanding. Rabbi Frand took the house down. He spoke eloquently, powerfully, and passionately. His message was that the Daf has a special power to urge us to do more and try harder in our Avodas Hashem. He ended with a great line: &#8220;Beyond your reach is within your grasp&#8221;. We can do more than we think we can do and the Daf pushes us in the right way. I was proud to share yeshiva allegiances with Rabbi Frand. It was a great moment for Ner Israel.</p>
<p>The surprise of the night for me was Rav Scheiner. I had very little prior experience with Rav Scheiner. Apparently he and my grandfather were best friends in yeshiva and he learned under my great-great grandfather from the other side, Reb Elya Lopian. Anyway, Rav Scheiner was masterful. He is a gadol from Israel but was born in America. His English was perfect (yes, he spoke in English) and his messages were timeless. He took every possible opportunity to heap praise on Rabbi Frand. It was very impressive to see a 90 year old Gadol HaDor shower Rabbi Frand with so many effusive compliments. His charisma and charm burst through his words. His genuine care and love for others was able to be felt as he spoke. His main point was that we should all try to commit to starting the Daf and that we should strengthen ourselves in unity and also learn the laws of forbidden speech to promote good will and harmony in Klal Yisrael. He was great. I hope we hear more from him in the future. A lot more.</p>
<p>Rabbi Lau was as good as expected. One can only imagine the emotion that he must feel at events like these. Here is a man who survived the death camps at the age of eight years old. He probably never thought he would survive and certainly I cannot imagine he dreamed he would ever speak before nearly 100,000 people in a football stadium celebrating seven and half years of dedicated Talmud study for the twelfth time. But that is exactly what happened and Rabbi Lau, in his inimitable style, conveyed that message along with many others.</p>
<p>Third, the video presentations were so politically correct, inclusive, and diverse. They were each very professionally produced and they did not feel amateur at all. These were super high quality videos. The attention to detail, their moments, and their universality were really very appreciated. The two gentlemen who proclaimed that they had finished Shas 5 and 6 times in the tribute to the teachers of the Daf were both from the modern Orthodox community. This willingness to step outside the yeshivaworld box made the videos even better than they would have been if they were more monolithic.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to make two observations.</p>
<p>First, I want to compare the Siyum to the Asifa. It is so much more inspirational when one standsÂ <em>for something</em> as opposed to standingÂ <em>against something.</em> The Siyum stands for Torah and for unity. The Asifa stood against the Internet. The impact of the Siyum, which did not ban or prohibit anything, was in my opinion several times more than the positive impact of the Asifa. You catch more flies with honey than you do with vinegar. The speakers spoke with smiles on their faces. The atmosphere was so positive and so optimistic that I have to believe the Siyum was very inspirational for many people. Part of the reason for that was the good attitude and pleasant spirit of the event.</p>
<p>This point could be demonstrated by comparing two statements. At the Asifa, &#8220;Râ Wachsman said that since all of Klal Yisrael is gathering together for an event, notwithstanding the fact that only a small sliver of the Jewish population was present at the Asifa, whatever edicts were initiated at the event would be binding on all Jews and if someone was not present at the Asifa, they were bound as well. Anyone who would not listen to the edicts was to be considered a defector and would lose their portion in the next world.&#8221;Â (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/20/the-asifa-is-done-i-was-fooled/">The Asifa is Done: I Was Fooled</a>)</p>
<p>At the Siyum, Rav Scheiner said we should take the inspiration of the evening and as Rabbi Frand suggested, we make a plan. Rav Scheiner&#8217;sÂ suggested plan for us was that we should all try to learn a daf a day and join the Daf Yomi movement and study the writings of the Chofetz Chaim. But he emphasized several times that we should say &#8220;Bli Neder&#8221;. We shouldn&#8217;t obligate ourselves with a promise, we should just try our best.</p>
<p>Do you see the difference? I do. It&#8217;s a big difference.</p>
<p>Second, I want to talk about Agudah. The Siyum HaShas is an Agudah production. I cannot tell you how incredibly the Siyum was produced. There were very modern multimedia presentations, there was music, there were intellectually stimulating speeches, there was very little &#8220;mussar&#8221;, and zero negative energy. The Siyum used the past for perspective but focused mostly on the future. There seemed to be a concerted effort to use technology and present orthodox Judaism as modern and appealing. I give Agudah all the credit in the world for creating such a wonderful Siyum atmosphere.</p>
<p>But then I think of the Agudah Convention and I can&#8217;t help but think that it is almost impossible to believe that the two events are run by the same organization! At the conventions, orthodoxy is very narrow and the focus is on tradition and the past. Â The Agudah Conventions do not resemble the Siyum at all! In fact the Siyum was so good that it might even outweigh the 7 years of Agudah Conventions between Siyums.</p>
<p>So there are two options here. Either Agudah will use this Siyum as a foundation for the future. They will embrace modernity to a certain degree and present a contemporary version of traditional orthodoxy and the convention will being to resemble the Siyum in attitude and production. Or the Siyum was an anomaly and the convention will be the same ol&#8217;, same ol&#8217;. I really, really hope it is the former. I want Agudah to be successful. I want Agudah to be relevant. I want Agudah to be the somewhat progressive, but traditionally orthodox organization it was when my grandfather was involved in the Agudah in the 50&#8242;s and 60&#8242;s. The Siyum style Agudah can be that organization. Hopefully, they will be that organization in the future.</p>
<p>The Siyum was absolutely amazing. I know I am inspired after being there. I know my son had a very special experience at the Siyum as well. I could not have asked for a better Siyum experience. Thank you Agudath Isreal of America. Next time <a href="daf.finkorswim.com" target="_blank">I hope to be making a Siyum along with the rest of the Daf Yomi</a> learners. And I hope you will too.</p>

<p>The segment provided some background on the nuance of opinions regarding the Asifa and managing the Internet in the orthodox Jewish home. Sadly, it was all moot, seeing as the rabbis threw down the gauntlet. But I think we&#8217;ve exhausted ourselves discussing belaboring that point.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/220px-RWS_Tarot_00_Fool.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5596" title="220px-RWS_Tarot_00_Fool" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/220px-RWS_Tarot_00_Fool-171x300.jpg" alt="" width="171" height="300" /></a>Let&#8217;s make this short and sweet.</p>
<p>The askanim I spoke with assured me that the Asifa would not ban the Internet. I explained that there is plenty of reason for skepticism regarding the opinion of the great rabbis when it comes to Internet. After all, every single public statement on the Internet was that the Internet must be banned. Then they tried to coerce the schools to disallow any child who had Internet in the home to attend any of the yeshivas and Beis Yaakovs. So I said, forgive me for being skeptical.</p>
<p>I was led down a path of fantasy and imagination. I was told that the rabbis won&#8217;t be banning the Internet at this event. After all, the slogan was &#8220;We can&#8217;t live with it, we can&#8217;t live without it&#8221;! There are going to be vendors teaching people about Internet filters at the event! So I believed in this myth. I believed that the new approach was going to be different. I believed they were going to advocate responsible Internet use. I believed that the standards would be subjective. I bought a bridge.</p>
<p>Three out of context quotes are all you need to know about the event.</p>
<p><span id="more-5595"></span></p>
<p>R&#8217; Wachsman said that since all of Klal Yisrael is gathering together for an event, notwithstanding the fact that only a small sliver of the Jewish population was present at the Asifa, whatever edicts were initiated at the event would be binding on all Jews and if someone was not present at the Asifa, they were bound as well. Anyone who would not listen to the edicts was to be considered a defector and would lose their portion in the next world.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Wosner said that the Internet is only permissible at one&#8217;s place of business and with a filter. It was not to be used in the home with or without a filter under any circumstances. Further, no school should accept any student who had Internet access, even with a filter, in their home.</p>
<p>R&#8217; Segal said that people think they need it for work, but it&#8217;s really just the evil inclination convincing them that they need it because they really don&#8217;t need it and they should not have it at all.</p>
<p>Sure, there were plenty of inspirational moments. R&#8217; Wachsman tried to walk back from these more extreme statements. He also made some intelligent remarks about the harms of too much Internet usage (and some erroneous ones as well). R&#8217; Matisyahu Salamon avoided objective rulings in his brief talk. But the damage was done.</p>
<p>The askanim were fooled, or foolish. And so was I.</p>
<p>I apologize for my [tepid] support of the event. It did not make the Internet somewhat kosher for those who want to listen to the rabbis. Nothing positive about the Internet was discussed. Websites with Torah and the ability to communicate with friends and family was ignored. In short, this event set the clock back to zero. I was wrong. Things are more bleak than I presumed.</p>
<p>The current status:</p>
<p>If someone wishes to listen to the &#8220;Gedolim&#8221; who spoke on the issue, they are forced to leave the Internet behind, for all purposes other than what is absolutely necessary for work. That means no buying things on Amazon, no using the incredible resources of hebrewbooks.org, no emailing family members, no divrei Torah via email or website. Nothing. Over.</p>
<p>The majority of people will take some nice lessons and inspiration from the event but will ignore the edicts and risk losing their portion in the world to come if R&#8217; Wachsman is to be trusted on these matters.</p>
<p>The smart people will continue to educate their children with wisdom and prudence. They didn&#8217;t need any Asifa to begin with.</p>
<p>We can mourn or celebrate the end of rabbinic proclamations on the Internet as there is no one who will take them seriously anymore.</p>
<p>The one glimmer of hope is that people will stop relying on rabbis and edicts to make all their decisions and do their thinking for them. It would be great if people started to realize that they need to take responsibility for themselves and their children. They can&#8217;t expect to get bailed out of all cognition by rabbis thinking on their behalf. It just doesn&#8217;t work. But more importantly, I don&#8217;t believe it is what God wants from us.</p>

I was quoted in this article as well and it gives a bigger picture perspective on my position than the article in the Friday edition. (See:Â <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/11/im-quoted-in-the-wall-street-journal-regarding-the-asifa/">Iâm Quoted in the Wall Street Journal Regarding the Asifa</a>)</p>
<p>The blog post goes into a bit more detail about the various opinions on the Asifa.</p>
<p>My position expressed in the article is a bit clearer than it was made out to be in the pervious article. Basically, I really hope that the Asifa can somehow make the Internet kosher for more people, it can give them access to this powerful tool, and hopefully they will also learn how to use it without breaking their own community standards.</p>
<p>That is my position.</p>
<p>But most of all, the last line in the article expresses my truest feelings:Â People shouldnât be Orthodox <em>âbecause they donât know better. We want people to do it because we believe itâs beautiful.â<span id="more-5531"></span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/WSJ460.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5522" title="WSJ460" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/WSJ460-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="180" /></a>The Wall Street Journal is taking its turn with the orthodox Jewish community following yesterday&#8217;s article in the NY Times. (<a href="http://finkorswim.com/2012/05/09/the-ny-times-article-on-sex-abuse-in-the-ultra-orthodox-jewish-community/">The NY Times Article on Sex Abuse in the Ultra-Orthodox Jewish Community</a>)</p>
<p>The article attempts to explain the reasons for the upcoming gathering at Citifield and the arguments against the gathering. It is pretty fair. I don&#8217;t have any particular problems with the article.</p>
<p>My problems are with Eytan Kobre who is quoted extensively in the article. The article names him as a spokesperson for the event. I Â spoke directly to people involved in the planning of the Asifa. I spoke to many other people who spoke to people involved in the Asifa. I never heard this man&#8217;s name mentioned a single time. It&#8217;s almost as if he was given the title of spokesman just for the article.</p>
<p>When asked about who would be on the program, the spokesman had no response.<span id="more-5521"></span> Some spokesman.</p>
<p>His sales pitch was this gem: <em>&#8220;Hopefully we&#8217;ll fill the role that the Jewish people have tried to fill from time memorial, which is serving as a beacon to the world and as a force for the transformation of the good in society.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Does he not know that intelligent people all over the world have been taking precautions against the harms of the Internet over the last 20 years? Does he not realize that filtering companies have millions of subscribers without the orthodox Jewish subscribers? You are late to the party. You can&#8217;t be a beacon when you wake up years after everyone else. The gathering is necessary simply because the attendees are less likely to listen to the good, wise advice of non-orthodox Jewish experts and are only willing to rely on the advice of a rabbi.</p>
<p>But when asked about the counter protest dubbed &#8220;The Internet is Not Your Problem&#8221; that is highlighting victims of sex abuse and the protecting of abusers in the orthodox community, Kobre said:Â <em>&#8220;Whether it&#8217;s a legitimate issue or not, and I&#8217;m willing to posit that it is a legitimate issue, are they really going to make progress on it by holding a counter rally? It seems like a cheap political circus. It&#8217;s sad. It&#8217;s unfortunate.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>If rallies don&#8217;t accomplish anything, what in the world are you going to accomplish at an Internet rally? Also, very benevolent of him to posit that sex abuse is a legitimate issue.</p>
<p>Another disappointment was the spokesman&#8217;s statement about what the gathering will advise. Every person I have spoken to about the Asifa assured me that there would be no objective standard. Each family will follow its communal standard. Some people will only use the Internet for Torah learning. Some will also use it for news. Some will also use it for reading fiction, or non-fiction. Others will use if for social purposes like sharing photos and videos. Others will use it for fun and engage others with social media. And even others may use it to watch a movie or TV show. Each family according to their standard. But the important thing is that everyone is aware that it takes vigilance and education to maintain that standard with the Internet in one&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>However, Kobre lay down the law. He said the Asifa will recommend that people <em>&#8220;block out all social-media sites including Facebook and Twitter&#8221;. </em>This is contrary to everything I heard. If it is true I am upset that I was told differently. If it is not true I am upset that this is what he told the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>In other news, the event is sold out. I am flabbergasted and somewhat relieved. They managed to do it somehow and I am happy for them. I hope the event is a success and I also hope the counter rally is a success. We need people to take action and get involved wherever their passion lie. If not for my Law School graduation that day I might have flown to New York to attend both events.</p>
<p>Read the article for yourself. I spoke with the journalist for about an hour. That got condensed into a short soundbite. As I have been accused of doing for my entire life, I &#8220;got the last word&#8221; in the article. So you&#8217;ll need to read all the way to the end.</p>
<p>If you have full access to the Wall Street Journal site read it on their site. If not, I have also linked a pdf version.</p>

<p>I still think there are many reasons one <em>could</em> oppose the Asifa. I still think women <em>should</em> be able to attend too.</p>
[By the way, I was told by one of the organizers that there is a simple reason women are not attending. The reason is that a large contingent of Jews made it clear that they would only endorse and promote the event if the Asifa was for men only. But up until a few days ago, it was intended to be for men and women. I mention this because some people took severe offense to my suggestion that the Asifa be open to men and women. Clearly, the organizers wanted it to be for men and women, so it's a bit much to say I am being <em>mevazeh</em> the Gedolim when I question why it is for men only.]
<p>But, during the course of my conversation with one of the higher ups at the Ichud HaKehilos I learned a lot and I have something important to say about the Asifa.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>huge of community of people who I believe should attend the Asifa</strong>. The Asifa is playing an important role and despite the various flaws in vision and execution, it should be attended by a specific (large) category of orthodox Jews.<span id="more-5459"></span></p>
<p>For starters, the Asifa&#8217;s position is that the <strong>Internet should not be banned</strong>. Their position is that the Internet is a reality of our modern world. We have it. Let&#8217;s learn how to use it. This is a major step forward.</p>
<p>For 15 years orthodox Jews have been told that the Internet is assur. The notable exception was for business purposes. The most permissive position of the Gedolim has been that Internet use is permissible &#8220;when necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people adhered to this rule. Many did not. Most orthodox Jews that use the Internet are using it for business and pleasure. That means they use the Internet to read the news, learn about the world, follow sports, share photos and videos (of vorts, upsherins and cute babies) with friends and family, read blogs (not just the ones that are &#8220;bad&#8221;), and socialize (with people with whom it is permissible to socialize).</p>
<p>These people are Internet savvy. They know the risks, they know how to avoid the risks, and they are generally responsible about how they and their children use the Internet.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people who listened to the advice of the Gedolim. They only use the Internet when necessary. They have Internet in their homes for business purposes. They have no idea what else is on the Internet and that their children can find everything that the parents are trying to protect them from with three or four clicks of a mouse. They don&#8217;t know that their children are going on the Internet on their mobile devices. They don&#8217;t know how to monitor their children&#8217;s use of the Internet, they don&#8217;t know how to protect their children or even themselves.</p>
<p>I am told that these people exist. And I believe it.</p>
<p>These people need to get to the Asifa. They need to learn about the dangers and the protections immediately. Sure, they could learn everything that the Asifa will teach them, you know, on the Internet. Or they could attend any of the local Internet safety programs that are well attended by non-orthodox Jews. But these people need to hear about these dangers and products from a source they trust. They need to hear it from rabbis or askanim who speak their language and carry the weight of the Gedolim behind their advice. Personally, I think this is unnecessary, but I believe that there is a huge audience for this kind of advice. Is it 40,000 people strong? I don&#8217;t know. But that&#8217;s a question of execution, not policy.</p>
<p>So if you are in the group of people, or you know others in that groups of people, go the Asifa or tell your friends to go to the Asifa. They need to be there.</p>
<p>The Asifa will educate and the Ichud HaKehilos will assist anyone who needs help in implementing the solutions you want to use. If you need help choosing or setting up a filter, you can call them for free tech support. If you don&#8217;t understand how a device works, the Ichud will help you too. I think it&#8217;s great. Frum tech support. It will be free and at your service. Nothing wrong with that. In fact, it&#8217;s a great idea.</p>
<p>A few final words. I do not agree that the Internet should only be used when necessary. I think it should be embraced as a modern tool for growth, relationships, Torah study, socializing, and acquisition of wisdom and knowledge. It seems that the Asifa is continuing down the road of &#8220;use it only when necessary.&#8221; I hope they come around to the more liberal view because I think we should think more positively, and harness the incredible power of the Internet for good.</p>
<p>I also think that framing the Asifa as a solution to the problems in our communities is flawed. It is its own problem and has its own solutions. The Asifa will not prevent people from leaving the fold, nor will it save marriages that are doomed, nor will it ensure that everyone <em>davens</em> with proper <em>kavvanah</em>, nor will it destroy skepticism. I sincerely hope that people are sophisticated enough to understand that those problems run much deeper than the Internet. Our c<em>hinuch</em> needs improvement. The Internet is not the broader problem here. It is <em>chinuch</em>. Destruction via the Internet is a symptom of a problem, not the actual problem. Treating symptoms may make us feel better but it does not solve anything.</p>
<p>Finally, the term &#8220;dangers of the Internet&#8221; means a lot of things to a lot of people. It seems that the Asifa is in fact most concerned with access to pornography. In our very lengthy conversation, the word &#8220;blog&#8221; was never mentioned in connection with the Asifa. I was pleased to learn this and I hope that this holds true.</p>
<p>However, there are other issues associated with the Internet. Like many permissible activities, it can be addictive. Awareness should be raised regarding this as well. Jut because something can be addictive does not mean it should be completely shunned. I also think that many people do consider blogs and &#8220;<em>kefira</em>&#8221; sites to be a major &#8220;danger of the Internet.&#8221; Obviously, these dangers are community specific and no general rules should be made. Lastly, some people consider social media an inherent &#8220;danger of the Internet.&#8221; This is a fallacy. Learn how to use the tools properly and it can be a wonderful and positive use of the Internet. Use them improperly and they can indeed be very dangerous for one&#8217;s physical and spiritual well-being.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>My advice: If you have the Internet in your home (and I think you should), do not allow any non-adults to access the Internet without protections. The best way to do this is to create a new user account for non-adults that has limited access to the Internet for the account user. The proper protection can be ensured by <strong><em>only granting access to specific websites</em></strong>. That means that the account user can only access pre-approved sites. Don&#8217;t rely on a filter. Give them access to specific, pre-approved sites. No filter is foolproof. If you let them on social media sites, monitor their friends and interactions.Â Obviously, make sure you don&#8217;t let them onto the adult user account on the computer. Protect it with the best password in the history of passwords. Finally, don&#8217;t give your child or teen any devices that have Internet access. If you want to protect <em>yourself</em> from accessing specific sites there is no solution other than self control.</p>

<p>There are a million and one things to complain about regarding the Ichud HaKehilos Asifa at Citifield. Pretty much everyone has read the <a href="http://dteitelbaum.blogspot.com/2012/04/open-letter-to-ichud-hakehillos.html" target="_blank">excellent post by Dovid Teitlebaum</a> pointing out the fallacy of blaming the Internet for problems within the orthodox Jewish community. I wholeheartedly agree that positive chinuch is far more effective and valuable than bans, broad policies, filters, and fear.</p>
<p>I also understand that the Ichud HaKehilos believes that there is a legitimate reason to sincerely fear the Internet. I am willing to grant them the courtesy that the imaginary Internet boogeyman is the most pressing issue in the orthodox Jewish community for a moment. However, it completely boggles my mind how they can justify, on their own terms, one of their executive decisions.<span id="more-5448"></span></p>
<p>The latest advertisements of for the Asifa are out and they proclaim that the Gedolim endorse the Asifa. Interestingly, there are no specific American Gedolim who are mentioned and I have not heard of any bold faced names from America in support of the Asifa other than R&#8217; Matisyahu Solomon.</p>
<p>The new ads also announce that tickets are now on sale. You can have the privilege of attending the Asifa for just $10.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just one catch. 50% of orthodox Jews cannot attend. The entire Asifa is for men only.</p>
<p>This is unconscionable.</p>
<p>If the threat of the Internet is so great, as the Ichud HaKehilos claims, how in the world can they make the marquee event for awareness and education about the Internet exclusively for men?! Are women not susceptible to the harms of the Internet? Should mothers of our children not be educated about the dangers of the Internet?</p>
<p>I honestly cannot fathom how the Ichud HaKehilos can say on the one hand that the Internet is so dangerous and then on the other hand exclude the mothers who are home with their children more than their fathers and the teenage girls who are just as present online as teenage boys. If anything, the girls have more access to computers and Internet than boys in yeshiva!</p>
<p>Again, I don&#8217;t think anyone needs to go to this Asifa. But for the Ichud HaKehilos who feels that this is the most important issue of our time, there is absolutely no excuse for limiting attendance to men only.</p>
<p>This is just further evidence to me that the project is flawed, lacks leadership and vision, and is very hard to fully endorse.</p>
<p>Here is the ad:</p>
