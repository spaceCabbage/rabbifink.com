				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Randi Zuckerberg, sister of Mark Zuckerberg, inventor of the Internet, or something like that, published an article in the Daily Mail about Internet use. It’s a promo for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062285149/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0062285149&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=eliyfink-20" target="_blank">recently published book called Dot Complicated</a>. Her premise in the article is that being too digitally attached is causing us to forget to live our lives.</p>
<p>She talks a bit about the idea of a Digital Sabbath that is gaining in popularity. Taking one day off from our gadgets and simply spending quality time with our loved ones.</p>
<p><span id="more-7847"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/unplug.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7848" alt="unplug" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/unplug.jpg" /></a>Further, she urges us to be aware of the difference between communicating via the Internet and communicated face to face or even through a phone call. It’s much more personal to directly tell close one about news or happenings in one’s life. Just because the Internet makes it easier, does not mean it should substitute for more traditional means of communication in all instances.</p>
<p>I have two things to say about this article.</p>
<p>First, while a Digital Sabbath is a superb idea and I love that it’s finding mainstream acceptance, I am loathe to use this as a reason to observe Shabbos. To me, Shabbos is an eternal day. It hearkens back to the earliest recorded moments of our religious history. It is the basis for Torah observance. It is not to be relegated to some digital vacation. It&#8217;s much more than that. And it&#8217;s been observed for millennia. Facebook is 9 years old.</p>
<p>I love the idea that other people are finding value in unplugging. I find it valuable too. But I really don’t like the idea that this is the primary idea of what Shabbos has become about. No. Shabbos is not a day to unplug. It’s a day to <em>plug in</em>. We <em>plug in</em> to our families, our spirituality, extra Torah study, our communities, our progress from week to week. We are to emulate God’s “rest” after a “work week” and experience that which we’ve created.</p>
<p>People who need a Digital Sabbath are welcome to join our eternal Sabbath. But we are the Sabbath hipsters. We were doing it before it was cool and for reasons far more eternal than escaping notifications from Facebook and emails.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are two elements to turning off. One part is to breathe. Experience life. Enjoy life. The other part is tuning in to others. I think both needs must be satisfied. We need our own space and we need to give ourselves to others.</p>
<p>Shabbos actually manages to give us both. Proper prayer is akin to meditation. It focuses us. It’s a way of returning to ourselves. Use the extended prayer service as a way to come in contact with yourself. We follow that up with a kiddush or a Shabbos meal. This is our opportunity to interact with others without distraction. There are no work distractions, there are no cooking distractions, there are no e-distractions. We enjoy our friends and family and give them the human interaction that we all crave. Spend that time well. It&#8217;s not to wasted.</p>
<p>We need to make sure that we take care of both of these needs to maximize our Shabbos experience. Take time for yourself and make time for others. Eliminate the distractions and together we celebrate another week of progress and accomplishment.</p>
<p>Shabbos has a way of celebrating the end of the previous week and setting the the tone for the following week. Digital Sabbaths are great, but the original Sabbath is even better. If you are ever looking for a unique Shabbos experience, come join us at the Shul on the Beach in Venice.</p>

<p>He is smart, erudite, funny, honest and unapologetic. I can really relate to his agenda as well. I absolutely agree with one of his many assertions. That is, fundamentalism (in this case, religious fundamentalism) has caused much harm to society and until fundamentalism is eliminated, the world is in a precarious position.</p>
<p>Much was made about Hitchens&#8217; cancer diagnosis when he fell ill. Some took it as Divine Retribution.<span id="more-3990"></span> Others used it as a talking point and asked Hitchens if his illness was giving him pause to reconsider his position on God. Hitchens was polite and reasonable when asked even the most ridiculous questions. I was impressed.</p>
<p>Since Hitchens is an atheist it would make sense that he would pursue the very best medical care in hopes of curing or abating his cancer. So it is no surprise that he has enlisted the help of a top notch physician and is participating in an experimental treatment.</p>
<p>But apparently it is newsworthy that his doctor, Dr. Collins, is an Evangelical Christian. As if to say, that an atheist like Hitchens should not / would not utilize the decidedly non-religious services of a religious person. It boggles my mind that this is news.</p>
<p>Atheists like Hitchens are uber-rationalists. It would go against his core beliefs to shun a specific treatment simply because the doctor is a believer. Further, the good doctor and Mr. Hitchens are friends! They know one another as they have debated religion together.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail is using this insignificant fact as a talking point to gratuitously mock Hitchens and question his atheism. I&#8217;m not even certain what the author of the article is thinking. How in the world is the religious affiliation of Hitchens&#8217; doctor relevant? And why take pot shots thoughout the article? The poor man is dying, LEAVE HIM ALONE!</p>
<p>Just look at the photos in the article. The Doctor is smiling happily. I mean, of course he is, he&#8217;s a believer. But Hitchens looks downright mean and grumpy. Aren&#8217;t all atheists unhappy? At least that&#8217;s what one of the commenters on the article unequivocally stated.</p>
<p>And take this quote for example: <em>Hitchens, a prominent Atheist, he refused to change his views on religion even after his diagnosis in June 2010.</em> As if to say &#8220;How dare he be sick and stay atheist! I thought there were no atheists in foxholes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well apparently there are.</p>
<p>To me, there are few things worse than exploiting a dying man to make a couple of superficial points. Shame on the Daily Mail. Conservatives and liberals can agree that death is bad and illness is difficult for all. Make your points using real examples, sound argument and intelligence.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t the exactly what Hitchens would do? That is something we can all learn from him&#8230;</p>
