				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sex_segregated_buses_divide_a_nation-460x307.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4966" title="sex_segregated_buses_divide_a_nation-460x307" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/sex_segregated_buses_divide_a_nation-460x307-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>In the United States of America the Supreme Court has held that &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; is inherently discriminatory. <del>Back in the dark ages,</del> I mean 60 years ago, white and black people in many states and cities were required to dine, shop, use the restroom and ride the bus separately. Riding in the back of the bus has become identified with discrimination.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that when Hillary! Clinton, feminist extraordinaire, expressed her dismay when she heard that a democratic country like Israel had bus routes that were segregated by gender. On several bus routes in Israel men are in the front and women ride in back.</p>
<p>Hillary!&#8217;s comments drew the ire of many religious Jews. To them, this was such a minor issue in the grand scheme of things, and so unrelated to foreign affairs that Hillary! could only have been commenting on the bus situation because she is a jerk / anti-Semite / hates Israel / liberal / feminist / whatever. Now, I concede that Hillary! probably should not have created a big deal out of the segregated buses. However, I agree with her dismay.</p>
<p>There are three very big problems with these segregated buses.<span id="more-4964"></span></p>
<p>1) They are illegal. I am indebted to <a href="twitter.com/noahroth" target="_blank">Noah Roth</a> for summarizing the Supreme Court of Israel&#8217;s ruling that public transportation may not be segregated. The reasoning for the holding is similar to the separate <em>is not</em> equal argument that was made in Brown v. Board of Education in the Supreme Court of the United States. The bus drivers are not supposed to let the bus riders enforce a &#8220;voluntary&#8221; segregation and there is litigation in the lower Israeli courts right now attempting to force the drivers to enforce the law.</p>
<p>2) They are halachically unnecessary. Halachically speaking, there is no requirement for segregation between men and women. Some will argue that men and women are not allowed to touch each other and incidental touching is very likely to occur in a crowded bus. This has already been deemed a non-issue by R&#8217; Moshe Feinstein (Even HaEver 5:14). In his responsa, R&#8217; Moshe says that incidental touching on a bus is not a problem because it is not &#8220;derech chiba&#8221; which means that it is not intimate touching. (Again, HT Noah Roth for the cite.)</p>
<p>3) Segregated buses are a big deal with minimal benefit. Let&#8217;s assume that &#8220;kedushas einayim&#8221; is a super-vital element of worshiping God. (I believe it is overblown, but lets pretend that it&#8217;s not overblown for a moment). Does that mean that it is more valuable than many other Torah values? Does that mean that it is more important to have one&#8217;s eyes averted by default than it is to demean women?</p>
<p>If you are an apologist, you are saying to yourself that the women volunteer to move to the back, so what is the big deal? The big deal is the message it sends. It sends a message to the public that we appear to discriminate against women. Even if you don&#8217;t believe that seperate buses are discriminatory, and I concede that in some situations they might not be, they send a message to the less informed public that we do discriminate. This is an awful message. Not only does it affect our interactions with our non-Jewish friends and neighbors but I believe that the message of segregated buses to the public reflects back upon us and affirms to us that we are in fact discriminating. In other words, what others think of us can affect how we feel about our own actions.</p>
<p>But I think the more important message is the message we give ourselves when we institute (or tolerate) separate buses.  The message is that people are so highly sexualized that a casual encounter with any woman is enough to wreak havoc on a man&#8217;s soul. This is not a new trend, but no less disturbing. Charedi periodicals don&#8217;t show pictures of women. Even modestly dressed women. Even saintly women. None. (Let&#8217;s not forget that Hillary! was photoshopped out of a historic photo by a Charedi publication.) Little girls are not portrayed either. In fact, I&#8217;ve seen periodicals that had the faces of female INFANTS blurred out. That is sick.</p>
<p>This is a real problem. First of all, it legitimizes thinking sexually about every female in the world. It&#8217;s as if there is no choice. Women are purely sexual and we are helpless to our base desires. It says that it is impossible for men and women to interact normally.</p>
<p>It also tells our community that women are required to be out of the public eye no matter what. They are the unseen and unheard part of our community. I believe we lose a strong voice in our community if women are marginalized or at the least, made to think that that they suffer an incurable disease of attractiveness. We should focus our attention and efforts into learning how to function as normal, healthy, well-adjusted people in a society of men and women. Fighting this hard for separate buses indicates a horrible state of missed priorities.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the buses will reintegrate and holy Jews will learn how to be holy in the real world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://66.147.244.183/~campbizz/finkorswim/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/tolerance0924061.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2621" title="tolerance092406" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/tolerance092406-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>This summer I took a class at Loyola Law School called Hate Speech Seminar. The course was very discussion based with some non-traditional law school reading. We also read the key First Amendment (Free Speech) cases and important Law Review articles on regulating hate speech.</p>
<p>I learned a lot.</p>
<p>Part of the course was a trip to the Museum of Tolerance at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.</p>
<p>I took my tour of the museum today. What follows are some general impressions.<span id="more-2617"></span></p>
<p>The museum is impressive. It is modern, hi-tech, welcoming and imformative. I have been to a number of the more prominent Holocaust Museums and exhibits. The Museum of Tolerance takes a unique twist on the Holocaust that I personally found more relevant than some of the other attempts to memorialize the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Perhaps most telling is the non-Holocaust exhibits. There museum has a universal message of tolerance and love that I can really relate to. I saw exhibits on segregation and prejudice. The truth is that even if there was no Holocaust exhibit, these exhibits made the trip worthwhile.</p>
<p>The Holocaust section focuses on the prejudices that existed in 1930&#8242;s Germany. The presentations are slick and grab your attention. The manner in which the information is presented is more like Epcot Center than a High School classroom. They use multimedia in a non-obtrusive way to convery their message.</p>
<p>The homage to shtetl life was sweet but I felt not entirely accurate. The romanticization of Jewish life in pre-war Europe is common and I only expected better from the MOT because they were so good at everything else they did.</p>
<p>As always, I was very drawn to the artifacts and Judaica on display. I absolutely love seeing real, used &#8220;things&#8221; from a time long gone. To see a Torah Scroll that was used hundreds of years ago, with its beautiful hebrew calligraphy and adorned with exquisite silver jewelry is very powerful for me. I also really enjoyed the day to day items on display. The collection includes a Cholent Pot from 19th century Germany. It is earthenware and marked with the words &#8220;Cholent Pot&#8221; and beneath that it has the family name. It looks really nice.</p>
<p>The overall theme of the Holocaust exhibit is that we all have biases. We need to work hard to overcome our prejudices to lead a more tolerant life. I agree whole-heartedly with that message and support the Museum of Tolerance in its work to disseminate that message.</p>
<p>If you are in LA or visiting Los Angles, make a few hour stop at the MOT. It will have an effect on you for a long time.</p>
