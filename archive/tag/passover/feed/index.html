				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6830" alt="Pesach meal" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Pesach-meal-300x197.jpg" width="300" height="197" />For most Jews, Passover is a pilgrimage. Instead of the pilgrimage of our forefathers to the Temple Mount, today we make a pilgrimage to our parents, grandparents, children, grandchildren, nephews, nieces, cousins, aunts, and uncles or some combination thereof. The holiday of Pesach as we call it, or the Holiday of Matzos as it is called in the Torah, or the Time of our Freedom and Holiday of the Spring as the day is known to the rabbis of the Talmud, could be said to have been supplanted by a new name, the Holiday of Family.</p>
<p>They say that one of the secrets of happy couples is that they share wonderful memories together. The combination of the experience and the positive memory associated with the common experience creates an environment where a good relationship can flourish.</p>
<p>I advise couples to actively try to create good memories. Do things together that are fun and exciting. Plan activities that will create those memories. And reminisce. Always look fondly upon those moments, cherish the memories, and plan more memory making merriment.<span id="more-6829"></span></p>
<p>This may sound a bit like cheating. It&#8217;s almost like artificially manufacturing a relationship. But it&#8217;s not cheating. It&#8217;s playing smart. No relationship can survive on the fumes of romance or even true love with no help. You need to stoke the flames, you need to create a common language, you need to have good memories.</p>
<p>Religion is a lot like a relationship.</p>
<p>One of the most effective ways of transmitting a love and excitement about Judaism is by creating good Jewish memories and associations. Nostalgia plays a large role in our lives. A song takes us back to our teenage angst, a smell takes us back to a vacation, an old friend takes us back to simpler times. When we are down, there&#8217;s nothing quite like Mom&#8217;s cooking to make everything all good again.</p>
<p>While religion must grow into something more sophisticated and mature than simple nostalgia, leveraging the natural feelings of nostalgia is a great way to augment one&#8217;s spirituality. After all, God gave us nostalgia. Let us use it.</p>
<p>The Seder is the perfect time to craft those memories. The smells, tastes, customs, and discussions of the Seder will linger decades after we sing Chad Gadya at the conclusion of our Seder. The content of the Haggadah and what we are able to learn and find inspirational during the Seder is so important, but the flavor and tone of our Seder will make a lasting impact as well. Who joins in our Seder will make a difference too. When we associate our family, and good feelings with the Seder, we have a formula that can create memories that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no shame in trying to create those memories. In fact, I encourage it. Make the Seder special. Make the Seder consistent.  Make the Seder a time for family. Make your own family traditions.</p>
<p>The story of the Exodus is as much a story of salvation as it is a story of becoming a family. We experienced an incredible exodus together and it bonded us together as a family. We relive those memories every year. This is one of the great ideas in the Haggadah. But we must also create our own new memories.</p>
<p>A New York Times article published last week drives home a similar message. The article proposes that <em>&#8220;The single most important thing you can do for your family may be the simplest of all: develop a strong family narrative.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>This is a clumsy way of saying that families need to know their story. Families that are happiest know answers to questions like these: <em>Do you know where your grandparents grew up? Do you know where your mom and dad went to high school? Do you know where your parents met? Do you know an illness or something really terrible that happened in your family? Do you know the story of your birth?</em></p>
<p>Our stories and our collective memories create strong families. Strong families foster confident, well-adjusted, happy children. This is wisdom found in a New York Times article in 2013. It is also found in our ancient Seder traditions. Even before the formal Seder was established, the Torah itself tells us to tell our children our story. We are charged with mastering our national narrative. So many of our rituals come back to the same point &#8211; &#8220;because God took us out of Egypt&#8221;. This is our way of reminded ourselves of our family story. It is so important that the Torah mentions it dozens of times.</p>
<p>One of the secrets of Judaism is our story telling. We read the stories in the Bible every week. Our Talmud is stock full of stories of our sages. Stories are one of the languages of Judaism. The Seder is a time to tell the story of our forefather, but is also the time to write our own, new stories.</p>
<p>This year, and every year, let us use the Holiday of Family, Pesach with its Seder to retell our national story and the birth of our nation, but also to write new chapters in our own family stories and create positive memories and associations with our religious experiences. In this way we will do our part in passing our beautiful tradition to the future of Judaism.</p>

What do I know?</p>
<p>Before I even cracked the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> open I had a basic idea of what to expect. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is designed to be an avant garde hagaddah. It is artistic in an almost postmodern way, it is typographically pleasing, the commentary is meant to inspire American Jews, and it was not orthodox. The commentary was written by Jeffrey Goldberg, Lemony Snicket, Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, and Nathaniel Deutsch. The translation was done by Nathan Englander. The hagaddah was edited by  Jonathan Safran Foer.</p>
<p>One of the things I was looking for in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> was whether it would be acceptable to orthodox Jews. Was there anything that would offend the orthodox Jewish adherence to halacha and general worldview? Another thing I wondered was if the commentary was any good without considering the blood pressure of orthodox Jews. The last thing I wanted to see about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> was if I would enjoy its presentation of the haggadah and Seder experience.</p>
<p>So on Shabbos afternoon I read through the whole thing.<span id="more-5315"></span> The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> has three basic functions. There is the text of the haggadah in the original Hebrew plus a contemporary English translation. There is a running timeline of Jewish history with a focus on Passover, that is completely independent of the hagaddah and Passover narrative that runs through the haggadah. There is also a collection of essays and food for thought during the highlights of the haggadah. Throughout the haggadah, instructions and laws are outlined and they are accurate enough. The specific amounts of the portions is not precise. They are not wrong. They are just vague.</p>
<p>My impressions of the text and translation is overwhelmingly positive. The text is true to the orthodox Jewish tradition. This was reassuring. I didn&#8217;t know what to expect, but since the Seder has taken on many different iterations throughout modernity, I had a healthy concern that the text would be different than what I was used to. Fortunately, this is not an issue at all.</p>
<p>My next area of concern was the translation. I must say that I was thoroughly impressed with the translation as well. It is a combination of beautiful English, devotion to tradition, and appropriate modern adjustments. One novel translation was in the response to the Wicked Son. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> translates this section by saying (emphasis mine) &#8220;&#8230;And by divorcing himself from the community he denies <em>our very essence. </em>Moreover, you must <em>blunt the bite of his words</em>, by telling him&#8230;&#8221; This is not the exact translation that most orthodox Jews would use, but it is true to the text and insightful. A second example of a novel translation is found in &#8220;V&#8217;Hi She&#8217;amda&#8221;. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds a poetic nuance in &#8220;For it was not one alone who stood over us, a heel on our necks, bent on our annihilation&#8230;&#8221; I found that one to be a nice touch. One last thing that stuck out was the adjustment from the oft used &#8220;simple son&#8221; to the &#8220;artless son&#8221;. This is perhaps no better than &#8220;simple&#8221; but &#8220;simple&#8221; horribly simplistic as well. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds one section of text that I had not seen previously. At the time that we fill the &#8220;fifth cup&#8221; and open the door for Shfoch Chamascha, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> adds a couple of verses from Tanach about Elijah the Prophet. I had not seen that before. It offends me, but only slightly, because the idea that Elijah the Prophet visits us when we open the door for Shfoch Chamascha is of questionable vintage and certainly not universally held. All in all, the text and translations were outstanding.</p>
<p>The most problematic part of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> for orthodox Jews is the &#8220;timeline&#8221;. It is highly academic and may, at times, offend orthodox sensibilities. Further, its focus on secular Jewish accomplishments are of little to no value to most orthodox Jewish Seders. One would be hard pressed to actually find anything that would be called &#8220;kefira&#8221; in the timeline, but I can see it being a source of discomfort for many orthodox Jews. I liked most of it.</p>
<p>As for the commentary, it was a lot better than I expected. The gist of the commentary could best be described as a fresh, relevant commentary. It is heavy on take-away lessons that apply in 2012 and light on rabbinic interpretation. However the rabbis of the Talmud and beyond do make several appearances.</p>
<p>If I had to point to its biggest flaw, I would say that at times it is too irreverent of God. Orthodox Jews will cringe at a few of the essays because they paint a picture of God that is not completely in sync with the contemporary orthodox Jewish views of God and His role in the world.</p>
<p>Still, many of the essays portray excellent ideas written in excellent prose that will surely spur a discussion of the haggadah that is familiar to orthodox Jews. For example, speaking of being &#8220;chosen&#8221;, one essay proclaims &#8220;Chosenness can sometimes feel like loneliness; a burden. Perhaps it is for this reason, the haggadah reminds us that our chosenness is an expression of love and a source for rejoicing.&#8221; Sounds like something an orthodox rabbi would say. Commenting on our statement that &#8220;today we are slaves&#8221; the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> asks the obvious question: But we are not slaves today? And answers that our impoverishment is our inability to do all the good that we want to do in our lives. If I told you that was from R&#8217; Yisrael Salanter, you would believe me. But it is not. It is from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a>. Another insight that sounds like a classic is the proposal that the plague that kills all the firstborns of Egypt is a &#8220;measure for measure&#8221; for the Egyptian decree to drown all the baby boys into the Nile. I am sure that others have said this as well. The point is that the commentary sometimes takes on the persona of the traditional orthodox Jewish commentators. There are other nice little &#8220;vorts&#8221; sprinkled throughout the commentary. Like the parallel between the hiding of the Afikomen and the hiding of Moshe as a baby that led to our salvation.</p>
<p>But there are two other kinds of commentary in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> that are bound to rankle some orthodox Jewish sensibilities. One is justified and the other might not be. There are a very small number of essays that may be objectively problematic. For example, one essay proposes that just like us, sometimes God forgets about people other than Himself. Ouch. But other than that, the irreverence and nonchalant tone about God and the Passover story are rarely objectively offensive, if at all.</p>
<p>The most common form of commentary in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is an anathema to most orthodox Jewish Seders, I think. That is, an attempt to take the lessons of the Seder and apply them to society at large, particularly, with a Tikkun Olam flavor. Personally, I think orthodox Jews should not recoil at the mere mention of Tikkun Olam, but many do. For example, one essay remarks that Shifra and Puah are the first examples of &#8220;civil disobedience&#8221;. This is a great point and definitely something to think about. However, few orthodox Jews will find meaning in spending precious moments at the Seder talking about it. Another essay tells a great story about Palestinian prisoners eating matzah on Passover because that is what they were served and invites questions about prison, the Intifada, and Israel. One humorous comparison pits Elijah the Prophet against Santa Claus. Both &#8220;visit&#8221; homes but Santa is forced to go through the Chimney. We stand up and open the door for Elijah. Again, a great conversation starter, but not the kind of conversation that one would expect at an orthodox Jewish Seder. But then again, maybe it should be. Our Seders are so focused on the past and interpretations from the past. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> has some great ways to bring the discussion into 2012 and that might be a good thing for some orthodox Jewish Seders.</p>
<p>In general, the preference of orthodox Jews is to quote rabbis and Torah scholars at the Seder. But as Maimonides famously said,&#8221;<a href="http://efink.tumblr.com/post/7246029090/maimonides-truth" target="_blank">Hear truth from whoever says it</a>&#8220;, I see nothing wrong with including the thoughts and ideas of a few American Jews who are not rabbis or even orthodox.</p>
<p>My only real critique is that in an attempt to be cool and hip, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> makes you turn the book on its side to read the essays and on its other side to read the timeline. Maybe I just don&#8217;t get it. But it is odd and quite annoying. I don&#8217;t see how it enhances the experience.</p>
<p>The verdict is that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is <em>acceptable</em> for orthodox Jews. It has some things to offer that will undoubtably improve your orthodox Jewish Seder. It has other things that will get ignored, but that may not be for the best. Some parts should be ignored, and that is okay too. I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> for most orthodox Jewish readers. If you want to avoid the most problematic essay skip the one that starts &#8220;God. who supposedly knows everything,&#8221;. Otherwise, to my eyes, the rest of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a> is completely safe. It may seem strange to discuss some of the things that are in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316069868/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eliyfink-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316069868">New American Haggadah</a>, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it is wrong or a waste of time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>A little while back, Google did a video like this and it has become a sort of meme. It&#8217;s a cute meme. It takes some creativity and usually its pretty good.</p>
<p>Aish.com did a nice job with this story of the Exodus using the same style.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the story being told in a new medium and while remaining basically true to the text of the story.</p>
<p>So kudos to Aish, enjoy the video and enjoy your pre-Pesach preparations!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><p>To be fair I have had my <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/01/14/all-about-manners/" target="_blank">share</a> of <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2009/04/03/irresponsible-journalism-from-the-new-york-times/" target="_blank">criticism</a> of the New York Times. I don&#8217;t call them anti-Semitic though, that just reminds me of Uncle Leo in the <a href="http://www.seinfeldscripts.com/TheShowerhead.htm" target="_blank">Shower Head</a> Seinfeld episode. Uncle Leo&#8217;s burger is medium instead of rare so he assumes the chef must be an anti-Semite&#8230; That doesn&#8217;t stop <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2005/11/the_new_york_times_and_the_jew.html" target="_blank">these guys from going in that direction</a>. (I found them in a google search result, I have never heard of them before&#8230;) Maybe Unlce Leo writes for the &#8220;American Thinker&#8221;.</p>
<p>And when the NY Times has an article that paints Jews in a positive light I feel equally compelled to raise the issue,<span id="more-440"></span></p>
<p>A few days ago the NY Times <a href="http://bitten.blogs.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">&#8220;Bitten&#8221;</a> blog ran a great article on April 1st / Fools Day, (tongue in cheek I suppose, but one never knows) about how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matzo" target="_blank">Matza</a> is just like Pizza &#8211; only better! <a href="http://bitten.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/is-matzoh-better-than-pizza/?emc=eta1" target="_blank">The article </a>takes a few stabs at the price of Shmura Matza (near $20 a pound) which is a legitimare gripe and gives a decent description of the process by which matza is fashioned and baked.</p>
<p>The line that <em>makes</em> the article is the close.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Shmura matzoh is an authentic product — not the re-creation of one — and authenticity is to be prized, especially when it tastes so good.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Pesach is the most celebrated Jewish holiday. Varioations and modern reincarnations of the Seder are everywhere we turn. I think that the original, authentic Seder is powerful enough and vast enough for years and years of discussion that we don&#8217;t need new versions. The original has plenty to offer us. But at least for everyone the Matza remains authentic. The Matza does not get adulterated.</p>
<p>The Seder reenacts and reminds us how the Jewish tribe became a nation. The Jewish people remain a nation because its precepts and tenets remain viable <em>unchanged</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame that the celebration of the birth of the Jewish people by many Jews would be unrecognizable to those who experienced the very first Seder. The authentic Seder tastes so good &#8211; we don&#8217;t need to change it! There are plenty of ways to bring your creativity to the traditional Seder.</p>
<p>The Matza reminds us all of what a Seder is all about &#8211; authenticity..</p>
