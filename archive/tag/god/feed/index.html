<p><em>Write an article about modesty that is respectful to men and women, makes a case for an orthodox Jewish version of tznius, and it also has to make tznius sound pleasant.</em></p>
<p>Can I do it? This is my attempt.</p>
<p>There are two aspects of <i>tznius</i> in orthodox Judaism. The first is the concept of modesty. The second is the details of how <i>tznius</i> is observed in orthodox Judaism. I admit that it is much easier to make a case for the first aspect than it is for the second. But I submit that once one is convinced of the first aspect, the second aspect becomes much easier. But I am hopeful that we can carve out a third aspect to <i>tznius</i>, if not in practice yet, at least in theory.</p>
<p>The Sefer HaChinuch asks an excellent question. There is a mitzvah to kindle the fire of the altar in the Temple. A priest would light the fire every day. If the Temple needs a fire, someone has to to light it. The problem is that we have a tradition that the fire on the altar came from heaven and thus there was no need for a mere mortal to light the fire.</p>
<p><span id="more-7298"></span></p>
<p>Answers the Sefer HaChinuch, this is the way of God. Whenever God acts in a miraculous way that displays God&#8217;s greatness, God will seek to hide God&#8217;s greatness and make the miracle appear to be natural. There will always be a way to rationalize the miracle as a non-miracle. This explains the requirement that a priest light the fire on the altar. It must appear that God is not acting in a way that is clearly miraculous.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s reasonable to say that God&#8217;s &#8220;moment&#8221; in the Bible was the splitting of the Sea of Reeds. That was the bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, down by three runs, and God hits it out of the park for the win. It&#8217;s the defining moment in our relationship with God until this very day and one of the most dramatic episodes in the Bible. It&#8217;s very interesting to note what is recorded in the Torah before the sea actually split. We are told that Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and strong winds stirred up the sea water all night. The next day God split the sea.</p>
<p>The Chinuch explains that God&#8217;s miracles must be hidden. God could have been a show-off and designed this big moment to be as dramatic as possible. The waters could have been completely still, Moses could have been crying on his hands and knees begging for mercy, and then God would swoop in at the last possible moment and save the Israelites with a grand show. But instead God hid the miracle behind outstretched arms and swirling winds.</p>
<p>This is the way of our God. Our God is modest. Even our all powerful God chooses to limit God&#8217;s exposure when performing miracles. The Chinuch concludes that this is true greatness. One who is great is not one who needs to make a show of oneself. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>To me, this is the essence of Jewish modesty. <i>V&#8217;halachta b&#8217;drachav</i>. We emulate God&#8217;s character. <i>V&#8217;hatzneah leches im Elokecha</i>. Walk modestly with your God.</p>
<p>Every person should strive to be Godly. Greatness is found when people don&#8217;t expose everything. This is the paradigm that we learn from God. Overexposure is unGodly.</p>
<p>But what is the reason for this? Is it some rule that can&#8217;t be explained? Or can we make some sense of this?</p>
<p>I think it does have some basis in reality. We are easily distracted. Please note, I am not saying we are perverts or we have a hard time controlling ourselves. I am saying that our minds are biased towards simplicity and gravitate toward the external things that are easily seen. Marketers know this and they distract us with beautiful people in their ads for horse manure. But wisdom and maturity are seeing things that are beneath the surface. Greatness is found behind a veil of modesty.</p>
<p>Of course it is entirely possible for a beautiful naked person to be espousing wisdom. It’s just harder to hear the wisdom. This had nothing to do with Judaism or God. Professors at universities, CEOs, and politicians in our Western society dress at least somewhat formally. We all understand this.</p>
<p>Taken to another level, we all disregard showboaters and over-aggressive, transparent, self-promotors. We dismiss those kinds of people and their ideas are taken far less seriously. Our minds know that greatness is usually not “in your face.” We know that greatness is hidden. I think this is the rational explanation for God&#8217;s behavior in hiding God&#8217;s miracles.</p>
<p>Modesty in Judaism is supposed to reflect this value. It applies equally to men and women and applies equally to clothing as it does to the rest of one&#8217;s life. This is the Jewish concept of modesty. It is the first aspect. It explains the value in limiting one&#8217;s external exposure.</p>
<p>If it ended here, we would all take this lesson to heart and try to make our own decisions in consonance with this ideal. Practices would vary but we would all try to live with this concept in our lives.</p>
<p>But orthodox Judaism is not just about ideas and concepts. The rabbis of the Talmud and their halachic heirs take these concepts and interpret them into laws. These are really old laws. Some are 2000 years old. Other more “recent” laws are only several hundred years old.</p>
<p>Over the millennia, the laws of each time and place were added to our legal codes. The rigid laws of our current <i>tznius</i> standards of clothing, whether from the stringent or lenient extremes are borne out of this system. They don&#8217;t really make sense today. They are not really expected to make sense today. These laws are mostly anachronistic.</p>
<p>Today’s laws seem to draw arbitrary lines about what can be seen and what may not be seen. There is little rhyme or reason and this is a breeding ground for stringencies and false displays of piety. With no firm halachic foundation, it is easy to invent new and improved ideas about <i>tznius </i>that can creep into society and become de facto standards seemingly overnight. Some people draw the line here and others draw the line over there. If you’re in doubt? Cover it up. Better to be safe than sorry. The spirit of <i>tznius </i>can be hard to find under these circumstances.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line it seems, we have collectively lost the ability to adapt our laws for modernity within the confines of halacha. That being said, orthodox Jews conform to halachic standards. Sometimes it&#8217;s not easy, sometimes it doesn&#8217;t really make perfect sense, but it&#8217;s the laws that we have and until they are abrogated they are the laws we must keep. This is the second aspect.</p>
<p>There is no real theological reason that <i>tznius</i> should be so heavily regulated and codified in Jewish law while all the other areas of our lives that require us to act with modesty are left to our whims and desires. Rather it is social. Dress codes and sensuality are things that people have traditionally been concerned with and thus we have a huge compilation of laws associated with <i>tznius</i>. This despite the fact that <i>tznius</i> in the Talmud is barely a blip on a very large radar. when it is mentioned it is mentioned as a restriction against reciting the Shema or matrimonial disputes. It is hardly recognizable as a formulaic dress code.</p>
<p>It can feel like there is a huge disconnect between the first aspect and the second aspect. To me it feels that way sometimes. But sometimes there is a price to pay if one wants to be part of orthodox Judaism. This is the way orthodox Judaism is now. It’s not perfect, but it’s the way the first aspect is attempted to be lived contemporarily.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t think it always will have to be this way. Mormons also have very strict modesty laws. Their laws also relate to all areas of one&#8217;s life but there is a dress code as well. Their dress code is updated from time to time. It&#8217;s a modern version of modesty. There are some hard and fast rules, but it is not 17th century modesty. It is modern modesty. One who follows their guidelines would certainly be emulating God&#8217;s modesty of hiding greatness behind a veil.</p>
<p>However, if an orthodox Jew would dress in the Mormon way they would probably be shunned by their orthodox Jewish friends and neighbors. It&#8217;s almost certain that they would be chastised by rabbis and modesty activists. But I would venture to guess that they would be modest and they would be satisfying the Godly standard of the Chinuch.</p>
<p>There are two Judaisms. There is the Judaism between Jew and God and there is the Judaism between Jew and fellow Jew. They are not always the same thing.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is a good example of this. One can be dressed very respectfully, modestly, and Godly but still not follow the laws of <i>tznius</i> as they are practiced in orthodox Judaism today. Conversely, one can follow the letter of the law of <i>tznius</i> and be the complete opposite of Godly. We all know this is true.</p>
<p>Maybe, if there is enough demand and enough people who won&#8217;t look down their noses at people with subjective standards of modesty, the first and second aspects of <i>tznius</i> could be reunited. I don&#8217;t expect it to happen quickly, I don&#8217;t even expect it to happen at all. But it is something to think about.</p>
<p>Perhaps there will be some sort of reformation within orthodox Judaism and the standards of <i>tznius</i> will be updated to modern sensibilities. I think guidelines that are similar to the Mormon regulations would be far less criticized than the standards we have today. This, coupled with a severe toning down of <i>tznius</i> rhetoric, blame, and false promises of salvation would completely change the tenor of the <i>tznius</i> conversation. We should be talking about God&#8217;s <i>tznius</i>. The kind of greatness the Chinuch describes is what our goal should be.</p>
<p>At the very least, I think attempting to emulate God in this manner is valuable. It can improve our lives. We can begin to appreciate the wisdom of universal modesty that applies to men and women in all of our lives. Understanding the circumstances that led to <i>tznius</i> regulations in orthodox Judaism today can also soften the challenge of arcane dress codes at least a little bit. But I think the hopeful part of this article is the most important part. Our collective standards might be able to change if we allow them to change. In our hearts we must know that in theory our goal is to be Godly in a way that is not intended nor should it ever be interpreted as a way to control women, burden women with the brunt of dealing with man&#8217;s animalism, some new-agey feminist form of liberation, or the fundamental way women serve God.</p>
<p><i>Tznius</i> is meant to be a way of emulating God. Let’s bring that back and try to end the current trend of fetishizing <i>tznius.</i></p>

I am big fan of Yoram Hazony and I really like his original thinking.</p>
<p>In his article he attempts to address the perfection of God.</p>
<p>The familiar view to orthodox Jews today is that God is All-Knowing, All-Powerful, and All-Good. Hazony makes two primary arguments against this view. One is that it&#8217;s fairly evident Jewish thought on this has evolved. The God the Bible seems to be more limited than the God we talk about today (and have talked about for at least 2000 years). Second, there are philosophical problems with calling God &#8220;All-Everything&#8221;.</p>
<p>The great rabbis of post-Biblical Judaism have done an incredible job of interpreting the passages in the Bible that seem to limit God. Yet, even some of the medieval commentators were comfortable with an anthropomorphic God. This idea has completely fallen out of favor and is now considered heresy almost unanimously.</p>
<p>But we are less adept at dealing with the philosophical concerns of an &#8220;All-Everything&#8221; God. Here there are newer issues that arise out of a better understanding of the world. Perfect is now understood in terms of balances. It is not understood as unlimited quantities of stuff. Further, to assert perfection requires us to have a complete vision of God. We don&#8217;t. God obscures Himself and even God&#8217;s favorite prophet Moses only caught a glimpse of God from the rear.</p>
<p>So Hazony proposes that we resurrect the idea of an imperfect God.<span id="more-6550"></span> The idea is that we hope that God will deal with us faithfully and there is justice. This creates a more true relationship with a more realistic God.</p>
<p>But the reason this idea has fallen out of favor, Hazony proposes, is because philosophers and religious leaders recognize that it is much more powerful to believe in the &#8220;All-Everything&#8221; God than the imperfect God. Hazony concludes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Instead, they have preferred to speak to us of a God consisting of a series of sweeping idealizations — idealizations whose relation to the world in which we actually live is scarcely imaginable. Today, with theism rapidly losing ground across Europe and among Americans as well, we could stand to reconsider this point. Surely a more plausible conception of God couldn’t hurt.</em></p>
<p>This is the core issue of contemporary orthodox Judaism. Is plausibility and minimalism a better weapon against atheism or is mysticism and maximalism a better tool? The ultra-orthodox camp firmly believes that the key is insularity and an expansion of required beliefs. It asks that their adherents shield themselves from the outside world and empirical evidence. The more progressive orthodox groups embrace the challenges of modernity by looking for less familiar views on God and Judaism that are more compatible with modern thinking. It asks their adherents to work through any potential conflict and accept scientific inquiry and some of its conclusions.</p>
<p>The question raised by Hazony is which track is more likely to produce the desired result of devout believers. It&#8217;s a good question. It&#8217;s a different question that what is most comfortable, or what is easier, or what is more intellectually honest. He is simply asking which track has a better chance of survival.</p>
<p>I think he is correct that eventually it will be nearly impossible to ignore the outside world and the conflicts between it and the more maximalist positions. Granted, there will be contradictions to the minimalist positions as well, but it is easier to swallow a small pill than to swallow a beach ball.</p>
<p>Read Hazony&#8217;s article and join the conversation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/far_away.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5426" title="far_away" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/far_away-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Klal Perspectives is a great journal of articles written by orthodox Jewish rabbis and writers. The difference between Klal Perspectives and other journals is basically the content. KP is not a halacha journal. It is a practical journal.</p>
<p>The articles are not about well researched, fine nuances of Jewish law. The articles are about the issues that the orthodox community is facing and how to deal with them. Because the articles are not academic, they appeal to more people and more people are capable of writing articles for the journal. In a pleasing development, several articles have been authored by women. Lay-people are also featured as writers.</p>
<p>I loved the first issue in the fall. I was less impressed with the third issue in the winter. In the spring issue that was recently published the journal found its groove once again.</p>
<p>Each issue faces a specific topic or challenge. The authors are invited to respond with their best ideas and draw from their personal and professional experience.</p>
<p>I always enjoy Rabbi Adlerstein&#8217;s writing and his work in Klal Perspectives does not disappoint. But the best two articles of the three issues were written by one man. Both of his articles were incredibly insightful and innovative. That man is Moishe Bane.<span id="more-5425"></span></p>
<p>Perhaps one day we will revisit his first article. While the spring issue is still fresh I wanted to invite everyone to read his article in this issue. The challenge being discussed in the spring issue is in the words of Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zweibel: <em>&#8220;the increasing numbers from across the spectrum who feel no meaningful connection to Hashem, His Torah, or even His people.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Most of the article I read accepted this premise and thought of ideas that could be implemented by tinkering with the existing system and model. Moishe Bane did not do that.</p>
<p>His article basically rationalizes and almost justifies the skepticism and burnt-outedness of many orthodox Jews. But his solution is not to read more books, read different books, go to different classes, sing more, etc. et al. His ideas are to rebuild the orthodox Jewish community. His solution is a social one. And I could not agree more.</p>
<p>He encourages us to take pride on our community and to ensure that there is a community worthy of our pride:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Jews’ identification with the observant Jewish community is sustainable only if the community is a source of pride. If community conduct and ethical standards are compromised, many will abandon their social allegiance, ultimately resulting in a theological abandonment, as well. These are the fundamental principles of chillul Hashem, and the implications are enormous. Ethical business practices, family harmony, and basic menchlichkeit must become hallmarks of being a frum Jew, as one would expect authentic Torah to mandate. If accomplished, frum Jews could then take pride in their community, and see the community’s values as demarcations with which to identify.</em></p>
<p>Further, he implores us to interact socially. Do things together with other orthodox Jews. Have friends. Real friends:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>There must be a renewed emphasis on deepening the basic social connections between members of the Orthodox community. The importance of friendships with others who share one’s values must be emphasized and facilitated. Time spent with others within the community must be encouraged. It is critical that the expansive role that observant people play in their professional and business environments does not redefine them socially, as well. Connecting with G-d begins with connecting to Klal Yisrael, and these efforts must be forged through shuls, schools and other communal organizations. Attending shiurim or learning in chaburas often provide the needed camaraderie, as do chesed endeavors, but not all Jews have access to these opportunities. Ordinary social interaction, per se, among frum Jews must also play a critical role. </em></p>
<p>I would only add that part of the reason social interaction is so minimized and difficult is because of financial pressures and strain, large families, over-hyped tznius concerns, among other non-essential beliefs and practices. We can also attempt to treat the source of this malady and not simply treat the symptoms.</p>
<p>Please read the article. Comment on it here or anywhere if you have reactions and thoughts.</p>
<p>I intend to write my own response to this challenge. I think I have a different perspective than the other writers and my ideas about this subject are certainly not conventional. Hopefully I will be able to write it up soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/richard_dawkins_2.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5199" title="Description=Richard Dawkins Photograph: Jeremy Young 05-12-2006" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/richard_dawkins_2-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" /></a>The premier atheist of the universe is probably Richard Dawkins. The common understanding of atheism is a rejection of the existence of a deity.</p>
<p>This definition used to bother me. How is it possible for one to be certain that there is no deity. Even if one is positive that a deity is impossible to perceive, it is certainly possible that the deity chose to remain hidden. In short, I always thought that an atheist who asserted unequivocally that there absolutely no God was a fool. It is literally impossible to be certain that a deity does not exist.</p>
<p>Dawkins was asked if he was 100% certain in his atheist beliefs. His reply? No. He half-jokingly added that he was 6.9 of 7 certain of atheism as the correct belief. Dawkins clarified his position that the &#8220;probability of a supernatural creator existing is very, very, low.&#8221;</p>
<p>So is Richard Dawkins still considered an atheist?<span id="more-5198"></span></p>
<p>I think so. While it is true that the common understanding of atheism is a rejection of the existence of a deity and Dawkins does not &#8220;reject&#8221; it, rather he is extremely skeptical, this is not really the definition of atheism. The real definition is the belief that one should not accept anything dogmatic based on faith. The atheist reject God, not because God doesn&#8217;t exist, rather because it is impossible to prove God exists and it is not necessary, in the view of the atheist, to add belief in God in order to successfully navigate through life.</p>
<p>Dawkins rejects belief in God because it is so improbable, in his opinion, and by definition impossible to prove. That is atheism.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also honesty.</p>
<p>I am sure there are people who are certain the God does not exist. I question how those people can be certain of something that is so inappropriate for certainty. But it was nice to see that Dawkins is not one of those fools. He is just someone who lives his life based on what can be proved and demonstrated via testing. Religions cannot be proved. They can be made into reasonable or rational beliefs, but they cannot be proved to the degree that an atheist like Dawkins demands for his personal decisions. If he is being honest, we should be honest as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/superstition.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-5148" title="superstition" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/superstition-300x214.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="214" /></a>A light hearted article in Tablet Magazine caught my eye today. The writer, Allison Hoffman, is a reform Jew who is in the midst of a pregnancy.</p>
<p>As a reform Jew, Ms. Hoffman takes pride in her enlightened, rational, science and fact based beliefs. She is not superstitious, nor does she use halacha as a guide for living her life. Like many reform Jews, she may equate the two as one and the same.</p>
<p>The problem for Ms. Hoffman is that during her pregnancy she has developed some nasty superstitions. Like many women who are carrying a fetus inside their body, Ms. Hoffman has developed a need to protect her baby at all costs. And this includes tapping into tried and true superstitions like not calling the baby by name until the baby is born and formally named.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all seen this happen. Perfectly rational people become irrational at certain times. Ms. Hoffman talks about her experience as a pregnant mom. Death does the same thing to other rationalists. Illness does it to others. Ironically enough, this phenomena has a scientific explanation too. When there is a uncertainty and doubt, the mind seeks to establish some control over the situation. Thus superstitions emerge.<span id="more-5147"></span></p>
<p>Ms. Hoffman is disappointed that there are so few superstitions in reform Judaism. The whole thing is rather entertaining. As a side note, it is interesting to see people defend superstitions that were borrowed from pagans or non-Jews as &#8220;real&#8221; or kabbalistic.</p>
<p>Pregnancy is one of life&#8217;s greatest mysteries. So much that is happening is unobservable and the stakes are so high that we want to somehow influence the result. We do what we cant, but we wish we could do more. We start to develop superstitions.</p>
<p>Death is no different. What happens after we die? What happens to the soul? What does it feel like? All these questions cannot be answered by observable fact. Science does not address these questions, other that to say &#8220;nothing&#8221;. Rational people become less rational around death. People who don&#8217;t believe in God or care about Mitzvah observance will come to shul and say Kaddish. I&#8217;m not saying that Kaddish is superstition. I am saying that it is out of character for a rational, non-believer to say a prayer for someone who died.</p>
<p>What does all of this mean?</p>
<p>It means that when things require an explanation but there is no explanation coming, human nature is to turn to a deity. This is what we call The God of Gaps. This belief system asserts that since not everything can be explained the only explanation that remains is God. In other words, God is to be found in the mysteries of life. Superstition and religion are siblings in this model. Closely related. Religion is legitimate beliefs that cover things that we can&#8217;t explain. Superstition are illegitimate beliefs that accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p>The problem with this belief system is that there is a line of progress that is shrinking the gaps. Drastically. What we know today is far more than we knew 20 years ago. Compared with medieval scholars we are all super-scholars. To borrow a phrase: If they are humans we are like angels. If we are humans they are like donkeys. Compared with the ancients we might even know more than they thought God knew! If one of us would travel back to the time of the ancients I am certain that person would be considered a God. This system encourages people to cast skepticism towards science. It causes people to doubt things that can be proved. It does not increase critical thinking. In short, it makes people less sophisticated, not more sophisticated.</p>
<p>The gaps are shrinking. Is God shrinking too?</p>
<p>It does not have to be this way. Maimonides wrote that God is seen in observable phenomena. The <em>more</em> we know about our physical world, the <em>more</em> we can appreciate the greatness of God. This is the opposite of the God of the Gaps. It is the God of Everything. Superstition and religion have nothing to do with each other. One is an attempt to explain things that we can&#8217;t understand. The other is an attribution of everything &#8211; things that we do understand and things that we don&#8217;t understand. In this view, there is no need to add superstitions or be sketical of science. As we discover more and learn new things, we can appreciate and even come to love God more and more. <em>(And don&#8217;t worry, science will never be able to prove that God doesn&#8217;t exist. It&#8217;s impossible.)</em> This system encourages progress because more knowledge is not be feared as an antidote to God. This benefits everyone.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day we will know even more about pregnancy and superstitions will become superfluous. We don&#8217;t need the mystery of pregnancy to find and see God. Marvel in its complexity and the &#8220;miracle&#8221; of child-birth. It&#8217;s not what we don&#8217;t know. It is what we do know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/the-rapture.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4258" title="the-rapture" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/the-rapture-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>It&#8217;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>Sorry. If you were looking forward to looting your rapture believing neighbors, change you plans.</p>
<p>Despite the billboards, signs and prophecies, there will be no rapture this weekend.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with the rapture predicti0n for May 21, 2011, read this article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_end_times_prediction" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>The first prediction that will not come true is the fierce earthquake that is supposed to start it all. Believers in the rapture will not be summoned to heaven either. I am sure of it.</p>
<p>How can I be so sure?<span id="more-4257"></span></p>
<p>Simple. The prediction is based on vapor. Harold Camping does not even claim to be a prophet. Rather he is using his logic to predict this pre-apolcalyptic event. It&#8217;s easy to discard his logic. It&#8217;s got more holes than Swiss cheese. When you base something on imaginary logic, there is no basis. If Camping were a prophet, or even claimed to be a prophet, then I might not be 100000% positive. After all, maybe he knows something we don&#8217;t know. But Camping is not a prophet. Nor does he claim to have inside information directly from the Source. It&#8217;s just magical mathematics.</p>
<p>For example, here is an &#8220;infallible proof&#8221;:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>God in His great mercy has given a marvelous proof that the year 2011 is the year of Judgment Day and the end of the world. Remember in 2 Peter 3:8, in the context of pointing us to the flood of Noah’s day as well as to the destruction of the world at the end of time, He declared: “one day with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Years ago we learned from the Bible that the flood occurred in the year 4990 B.C. More recently we learned that Judgment Day is to occur in the year 2011 A.D. 2011 A.D. is exactly 7,000 years after 4990 B.C.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Just before the flood Noah was instructed by God that in seven days the flood would begin (Genesis 7:10-16). Using the language of 2 Peter 3:8 that “a day is as a thousand years,” it is like saying through Noah, who was a preacher (2 Peter 2:5): “mankind has seven days or 7,000 years to escape destruction.” Since 2011 A.D. is precisely 7,000 years after Noah preached, God has given mankind a wonderful proof that Judgment Day will occur in the year 2011.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>God doubled the statement “a day is as a thousand years” to greatly increase our assurance that this is established by God and will shortly come to pass (Genesis 4:32).</em></p>
<p>Not infallible actually. And there are more, even flimsier proofs <a href="http://www.familyradio.com/graphical/literature/proof/proof.html" target="_blank">on his site</a>.</p>
<p>So I can be confident, and so can you, that the Rapture is not imminent.</p>
<p>But what of all the believers? What of all the people who will be bent on hand and knee this evening waiting for their Maker to take them back? What will happen to them when the Rapture prediction does not come true?</p>
<p>I posed this question on Facebook and Twitter. Not a single person who responded thought that the believers would abandon their beliefs based on this colossal error.</p>
<p>I think I agree. (I hedge because perhaps one or two people will give it up eventually and base it on this failed prediction, but the vast majority will cling to their beliefs.) And I find this extremely fascinating.</p>
<p>It seems that the believers are not interested in proof, logic or even facts. Which is why their proofs are so dumb and no one cares. Their belief outweighs reality.</p>
<p>The irrational belief in something based on an event that is supposed to occur and then does not occur falls on the extreme end of the absurdity scale. It is qualitatively different than belief in God in general. There is no evidence that goes against the belief in God. There is just lack of evidence of God&#8217;s existence. That is a belief that scores very low on the absurdity scale. And 95% of Americans believe in God. It can&#8217;t be THAT absurd.</p>
<p>So while I feel license to ever so slightly mock those who believe that May 21, 2011 is Judgment Day, I don&#8217;t feel that the same criticism is warranted against those who believe in God.</p>
<p>Finally a word on proofs. I was told by <strong>Alan Danziger</strong> that proof and prove used to have different meanings. Apparenty, they are still supposed to. But it seems that Harold Camping is misusing the word proof on his website because his proof does not actually prove anything. The truth is, that a proof does not need to &#8220;prove&#8221; something to be called a proof. This would legitimize Camping&#8217;s use of the word proof, but for the fact that he says &#8220;infallible&#8221;. Which it is not. So while one can have a proof for something that does not prove its existence, one can&#8217;t have an infallible proof that does not prove its existence.</p>
<p>This is important because sometimes we will hear &#8220;proofs&#8221; for the existence of God or the Divine Authorship of the Torah even though the proofs do not &#8220;prove&#8221; what they assert.</p>
<p>I believe it is important to be careful with these distinctions so that one does not seem to place the value of something that is proved upon a proof.<em> V&#8217;hamayvin Yavin</em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scales-of-justice-legal-aid-toronto-gta-canada.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4235" title="scales-of-justice" src="http://finkorswim.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/scales-of-justice-legal-aid-toronto-gta-canada.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="299" /></a>One of the confusing things about the Bible is the different names attributed to God. To Bible critics this is an indication that more than one God or more than one version of God or simply more than one author is present in the Bible.</p>
<p>Talmudic Judaism has a different approach. God, the One God, has more than one name (see yesterday&#8217;s Rambam class: <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2011/05/15/rambam-class-51511/">Rambam Class 5/15/11</a>). Since God is infinite and cannot be limited to one &#8220;mood&#8221; or &#8220;characteristic&#8221; therefore different names are used when God is Acting in a specific way. That specific way cannot define God because it would limit God. Instead, the Torah uses different names to identify the character of God in that Act, commandment, prophecy. The Ineffable name of God, יהוה, refers to God&#8217;s mercy. The other commonly found name in the Bible is אלוהים. This name refers to God&#8217;s precise Judgment.</p>
<p>The two Names play off each other. Without mercy, the judgment would be too harsh and without the judgment, the mercy would be too forgiving. There is a balance. A Perfect balance.</p>
<p>God is both our Father and our King. God loves us and we are expected to love God back. God also metes out punishment and we are expected to fear God.</p>
<p>This is all very nice, but why talk it about it today?<span id="more-4232"></span></p>
<p>Because of  a (fairly) recent article in LA Times.</p>
<p>A couple weeks ago the LA Times reported on a study that determined the willingness of diffferent kinds of people to cheat on a test. Three very interesting things arose from the peer reviewed and published study.</p>
<p>First, that there is no difference between the ethical behavior of atheists and believers. This is surprising to believers because there is a lot of rhetoric directed against non-believers. The rhetoric often claims that non-believers prefer not to believe to give them license to act immorally. After all, if there is no God, why act morally? This study debunks that assumption. There is a better, more precise argument about the difference between the morality of atheists and believers. That is, the believer&#8217;s source of morality is a Creator. The Creator can better establish the baseline of morality than humans. An atheist&#8217;s version of morality is subject to the ideas of flawed people. (Of course the counter argument is that the word of God is subject to interpretation. To which the counter to that counter is that the interpretations of a specific religious sect are claimed to be Divine as well. And so on and so one&#8230;)</p>
<p>The second was that 95% of americans believe in God. Which does skew the perception that God is losing and falling out of the collective american soul. But those 95% have many very different views of God. Some believe God is very involved in the daily lives of humans and others believe God created the world and took a vacation. Others believe that God will render judgment in the afterlife and others do not. The point is that while 95% agree God exists, who that God is, is still very much in debate. But also, I believe the significantly smaller sample size of atheists does affect the results of the this study in some way. I am just not certain how.</p>
<p>The third, even more interesting part of the study demonstrated that there is a difference in the ethical decisions of believers in a punitive God and belief in a compassionate God. Turns out that believers in a punitive God were less likely to cheat than believers in a compassionate God. At first glance, this is not surprising. But it is discouraging. It seems to me that the believers in a compassionate God are able to excuse unethical behavior on account of the belief that God will forgive their sins. Even if God does forgive their sins, isn&#8217;t it important to be honest and moral anyway? I believe it is.</p>
<p>Talmudic Judaism accounts for both of these versions of God. We believe that God is compassionate and God is perfectly just. There exists a balance and perhaps this would serve as a correction for those who focus on the compassion of God. This balance is important and upsetting the balance appaers to threaten to affect the morality of believers.</p>
<p>To me, this study affirms the wisdom of the Torah and Talmudic tradition by including both of these aspects of God and not the exclusion of the other.</p>

<p>The Bills played the Steelers very tough on Sunday. The Steelers have much more talent, a much better record and by all accounts should easily have handed the Bills their 9th loss (out of 11 games). But somehow, the Bills put together a rally and found themselves in a tie game at the end of regulation forcing overtime. In the NFL overtime is sudden death (during the regular season) which means that the first team to score, wins the game.</p>
<p>It was all tied up about four minutes into overtime when this happened&#8230;<span id="more-3372"></span></p>
<p><object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UHhK2pWZ2dM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UHhK2pWZ2dM?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object></p>
<p>The Steelers found a way to win the game in overtime and the Bills stumbled to 2-9.</p>
<p>After the game, Steve Johnson, the wide receiver who dropped the ball in the endzone, took out his frustrations on his Twitter account.</p>
[blackbirdpie id="9006757670031360"]
<p>I think, that translates into something like this:</p>
<p><em>Dear God,</em></p>
<p><em>I am your loyal servant. I pray to you. I praise you. I believe that everything I have is from you. So why did You cause me to drop that pass? Why did you let me down when I needed you most.</em></p>
<p><em>Love, </em></p>
<p><em>Steve</em></p>
<p>Almost immediately, the tweet ignited a firestorm. I&#8217;m not sure who was more incensed, the religious people or the not religious folks. Frankly, I can&#8217;t understand why anyone would be offended by an obviously dejected football player&#8217;s religious rant.</p>
<p>Yet, people were offended. People were uncomfortable hearing that God was responsible for the dropped pass and the lost game.</p>
<p>What is interesting to me is the implications of Johnson&#8217;s tweet. Most people don&#8217;t think twice when an athlete, or anyone else for that matter, thanks God when they accomplish something remarkable. Politicians winning elections, athletes winning games, business people making the big deal, chefs cooking the perfect dish or any of the millions of minute instances in our daily lives that religious people thank God for whatever they are feeling or experiencing. Ask an Orthodox Jew how they are doing and 99% of the time the answer will be something like Baruch Hashem, Blessed is God.</p>
<p>And it seems that we have no problem with this. But isn&#8217;t the implication of &#8220;everything good comes from God&#8221; that &#8220;everything bad comes from God as well&#8221;?</p>
<p>It is. It&#8217;s no different at all. If one attributes everything good to God, then one is forced to attribute everything bad to God as well. The Talmud says that the same one should make a blessing when something good happens, one should make a blessing when something bad happens.</p>
<p>And this is where Johnson veered off course. Johnson assumed that God would only do good for him. Johnson assumed that his prayers and his praise guaranteed his success. Of course, this is not the case. Subscribing everything to God requires one to accept that God has a Plan and one is subject to that plan regardless of whether one is satisfied with the outcome or not.</p>
<p>Truthfully, this conversation is probably moot. Judaism subscribes to a theory of Divine Involvement. There are various opinions as to how much Involvement there actually is in our lives. According to most, it is a lofty level indeed to merit the kind of Involvement that every moment of one&#8217;s life is directed by God.</p>
<p>For most of us, God remains hidden. We carry on our lives with the assumption that we do the best we can in the face of the myriad of options that present themselves to us on a daily basis. We say &#8220;Thank God&#8221; when good things happen, not to say that God is the only Party directly responsible for our good fortune, rather to include God in our success so that we do not forget that our existence is thanks to God.</p>
<p>One more thing. Even according to those who attribute Divine Involvement to more people, the Inolvement does not exonerate one for their actions. Involvement can move &#8220;pieces&#8221;, create scenarios, but our choices and our actions are still our choices and our actions. It is impossible to blame God for our misdeed. We make the choices. We perform the action.</p>
<p>In the end, Johnson clarified his position. He was merely trying to figure our what he was supposed to learn from his failures. I think he just needs to concentrate a little better on football and a little less on blame&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I live in Los Angeles where we are famous for our billboards. I grew up near New York City famous for its Madison Avenue and advertising. Normally the danger of these advertisements is the images they supply. The images are designed to be salacious and titillating. Apparently London has another whole set of issues they need to deal with on their <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/world/europe/07london.html" target="_blank">bus advertisements</a>.</p>
<p>I have a problem with the tone of the advertisement. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/83015819@N00/3169737401/sizes/l/" target="_blank">&#8220;There&#8217;s probably no God.  Now stop worrying and enjoy your life&#8221;</a>. There is a flaw in the logic here. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_fallacy" target="_blank">logical fallacy</a> that cannot be ignored is evident. The argument assumes that if one believes in God then they are worrying <em><strong>and</strong></em> if there is no God then you have no worries. This is false on both accounts. In fact I would say that if there is a God then you <em><strong>don&#8217;t</strong></em> need to worry as God must have some sort of plan using Godly wisdom which we cannot fathom. If there is no God then your worries are real. You are part of a random universe subject to the randomness of time. Now that is something to worry about!</p>
<p>The concept for the ads comes from, ironically enough, a <a href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/the-atheist-bus-drove-in-on-the-web/?hp" target="_blank">blog</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jun/20/transport.religion" target="_blank">post</a>. The blogger is upset that London buses were promoting Biblical scriptures. Not everyone believes in God so she found the ads offensive. This I agree with. Scripture on buses reminds me of one of Pacific Jewish Center community member Milton Simon&#8217;s favorite ideas. &#8220;I have the truth, and you must obey&#8221;. Meaning plastering scripture on the side of a bus tells the non-believer that he is a) a bad person and b) going to hell. I find this offensive as well.</p>
<p>The good news is that a blog post can have a big impact!</p>
<p>Behind all of this, is the surging movement of <a href="http://www.whybelieveinagod.org/index.html" target="_blank">Humanists.</a> They are behind these ads as well as some others which are not as offensive. The<a href="http://www.whybelieveinagod.org/print/side_closeup.jpg" target="_blank"> ads which are running on Washington D.C. buses</a> read &#8220;Why believe in God? Be good for goodness&#8217; sake&#8221;. Interesting concept. The truth is that this would be nice. People actually being good for goodness&#8217; sake. But again another fallacy exists in this ad. Belief in God is not so that we should be &#8220;good&#8221;. We believe that goodness <strong>does</strong> exist without God. <a href="http://finkorswim.com/2008/12/22/intro-to-talmud-1/" target="_blank">I gave a lecture about this and you can hear / download it on this blog.</a> God is just there to give us a hand so that we know what good is in a given situation. Sometimes it&#8217;s too hard for us to know what &#8220;good&#8221; is. Yes, most of time we have an intuition as to what it is right and what is good. We need God&#8217;s higher wisdom to help us out when we don&#8217;t know what to do! It happens. Also, sometimes we want to grow. Sometimes we want to be better than good. How can we work on ourselves to be better? We are given instructions in this regard from God as well. So it is nice for the world to be good for goodness&#8217;s sake but we want more that just good. We want a life of growth. And we can have it!</p>
